1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,640
(The Penthouse brought a sensation
all over Korea.)

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,980
(They're back.)

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,009
(Stories that'll leave you
speechless)

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,080
(Don't kill your husband.)

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,820
(More extreme stories)

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,359
(Stories to draw you right in)

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,760
(Stories with plot twists)

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,969
(Their own awards ceremony,
Hidden Awards)

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,240
(And...)

10
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:42,579
(a mysterious woman is
at the studio.)

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,780
(Even stronger temptations are
coming.)

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,719
(A heated villain contest to leave
everyone fuming)

13
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,920
(The story that hasn't ended yet.)

14
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,359
(Aren't you excited?)

15
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,829
(We will begin now.)

16
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,899
The Penthouse 2,

17
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,700
Hidden Room, is now open!

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,299
(The Penthouse 2 Special,
Hidden Room: Unfinished Story)

19
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:08,439
(Um Ki Joon as Joo Dan Tae)

20
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,469
Right.

21
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:13,109
The first season was sensational,

22
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,939
but the second season gained
even more popularity.

23
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,549
- I love this.
- What?

24
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:21,209
When I start a show
and there's an empty seat.

25
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,719
It's so obvious that
someone is missing.

26
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,420
I like it real.

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,620
- Indeed.
- That is Lee Ji Ah's seat.

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,890
Ji Ah is currently filming, right?

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,159
Yes.

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,629
By the time we were filming this,

31
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,659
all the filming for the drama was...

32
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,370
supposed to be finished,

33
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,969
but with dramas, filming schedules
always get behind.

34
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,000
Right.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,939
By the time the show airs,

36
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,040
the last episode of The Penthouse 2
would've aired.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,939
But we haven't...

38
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,950
watched the last episode...

39
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,510
as we're sitting here.

40
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,650
I'm so frustrated.

41
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,719
(Eugene as Oh Yoon Hee)

42
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,920
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes.

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,989
I'm dying to find out
what happens in the last episode.

44
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,219
But our viewers would've
already watched it.

45
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,790
Yes, they'd have watched
the last episode by now.

46
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,790
Indeed.

47
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,359
We've prepared a video...

48
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,769
of how sensational
The Penthouse 2 was like,

49
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,770
so let's go ahead
and watch that first.

50
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,199
You made it sound as if you prepared
the video.

51
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,310
Our crew has prepared it.

52
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,669
"Our story inside The Penthouse".

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,479
Splendor from which you can't
take your eyes off of.

54
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,750
- 1.5 million dollars!
- 2 million dollars!

55
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,210
- 3 million!
- 4 million!

56
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,050
- How much?
- 5 million.

57
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,550
In The Penthouse,

58
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,620
everyone has millions of dollars.

59
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,789
(To these people,
a 5-million-dollar home is nothing.)

60
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,759
I want to live
somewhere like this too.

61
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,530
While watching the drama,
did you ever feel...

62
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,569
like the life in the drama was
so different from yours?

63
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,199
However,

64
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,639
that is very much not the case.

65
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:55,840
That is, when you look closely.

66
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,979
My desire for money...

67
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,349
(Her desire has been filled?)

68
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,990
(But it's in human nature
to have endless desires.)

69
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,719
(Even if it means they must sell
their souls...)

70
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,319
Even if it means they must sell
their souls,

71
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,960
A return on investment
of 250 percent.

72
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,199
they want more.

73
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,270
What I want is
the grand prize trophy.

74
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,639
With people, there are things
that we want to take,

75
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,469
I'll do whatever it takes
to erase your memory.

76
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,539
and there are others
that we want to protect.

77
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,439
Are you sure
you can protect Eun Byeol?

78
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,210
I'm going to protect her
with my life.

79
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:35,919
When you see it
from that perspective,

80
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,020
you'll realize that these people
in the drama are just like us.

81
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,460
Even if that means you have
to kill Bae Ro Na?

82
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,229
Except that how they get things is
not exactly right.

83
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,830
Every human has desires.

84
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,830
I think The Penthouse is
a dramatized example...

85
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,099
of what happens when people try
to fill their desires...

86
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,270
in the wrong ways.

87
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,780
There's another human instinct...

88
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,009
that this drama alludes to.

89
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,479
Let's look
at each character in the drama...

90
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,949
to examine this closely.

91
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,419
Pull yourself together, Oh Yoon Hee.

92
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,419
Seo Jin.

93
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,819
That is, humans aren't
single-faced,

94
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,120
but have multiple faces.

95
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,259
In other words,
the good and the bad,

96
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,899
and...

97
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,300
Hello,

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,970
I'm Director Cheon Seo Jin.

99
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,399
the strong...

100
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,170
and the weak coexist in us.

101
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,740
(Opposing traits coexist in us.)

102
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,310
Shim Su Ryeon was almost the only
"good" character in the drama.

103
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,279
I'm sorry, Yoon Hee.

104
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,990
I'm going to use you for a bit.

105
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,319
Even she uses others...

106
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,689
to get her revenge on someone.

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,899
You're my winning lottery ticket...

108
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh Yoon Hee was the same.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
(Yoon Hee is someone who knew
how to appreciate her people.)

110
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:03,970
She...

111
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,110
(Get rid of Shim Su Ryeon.)

112
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,779
repaid goodness with bad.

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,550
And in the first season,

114
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,949
Cheon Seo Jin did every bad thing
you could possibly imagine.

115
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,550
I feel like a monster.

116
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,589
I feel like it's all my fault.
It's driving me crazy.

117
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,730
Even she was a human
who has regrets.

118
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,800
(Even she has her weak side.)

119
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,769
Like this, The Penthouse...

120
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,269
narrates that humans don't change,

121
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,439
but with each situation,

122
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,310
different sides of them
are brought out.

123
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,680
Oh Yoon Hee is a great example
of this.

124
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,649
(Yoon Hee suddenly jumped
into the rich people's world.)

125
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,920
After she moves into Hera Palace,

126
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,689
Is this really our house?

127
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,259
her suppressed desires...

128
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,189
start to come out.

129
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,060
They become more extreme.

130
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,399
(Moving into Hera Palace
triggered her greed.)

131
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,430
So, in other words, anyone can be
like Shim Su Ryeon,

132
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:09,970
Cheon Seo Jin, and Oh Yoon Hee.

133
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,509
With that said,

134
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,310
do you remember
the character keywords last season?

135
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,750
(Sickly sexy)

136
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,180
In season one, this man has...

137
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,449
coined the term, "sickly sexy."

138
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,050
(The sickly sexy man, Ha Yoon Chul)

139
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,660
I warned you.

140
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,730
I won't stay still if you hurt
my wife.

141
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,629
Ha Yoon Chul showed
his macho side...

142
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,230
and even a chokeslam,

143
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,899
becoming a strong sexy man.

144
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,569
Strong sexy!

145
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,240
People change after all.

146
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:46,209
(Eugene's keyword fit her
perfectly.)

147
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:49,339
And back in season one,
Oh Yoon Hee was described...

148
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,750
as someone who's always fighting,
crying, or drinking.

149
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,379
I quit drinking in season two.

150
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,350
That's not easy to do.

151
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,519
(She didn't drink a single sip
of alcohol in season two.)

152
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,420
(She doesn't even have
a glass in front of her.)

153
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,689
I didn't want people
to get mad at me...

154
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,660
for still drinking
after killing someone while drunk,

155
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,860
so I quit drinking.

156
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,300
Then, who's taking...

157
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,829
this "fighting, crying, or drinking"
keyword?

158
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,800
(Cheon Seo Jin)

159
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,439
Open the door, Oh Yoon Hee!

160
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,410
(She fights with Yoon Hee,)

161
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,980
(with Yoon Chul,)

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,350
You jerk!

163
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,120
(and with Joo Dan Tae,
who she got along great with.)

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,449
You're the stupid one!

165
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,949
You jerk.

166
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,050
Get out!

167
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,620
(As if that's not enough,
she fights with her daughter too.)

168
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,360
You fought so much.

169
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,089
Do you know what we've done
for you?

170
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,100
When did I ever ask for that?

171
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:48,000
- Ha Eun Byeol!
- What?

172
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,569
Like mother like daughter.

173
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,370
(She cries because of her daughter.)

174
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,279
I think I might go crazy
if my daughter was like that.

175
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,009
(She cries because of her father.)

176
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,079
She cried so much.

177
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,620
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,379
The way she cries...

179
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,819
Don't go to Oh Yoon Hee.

180
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,790
(And she cries even more
because of men.)

181
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,189
(Why don't I drink some soju
to feel better?)

182
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,189
(Maybe some hard liquor this time.)

183
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:16,300
She drank a lot.

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,529
(But her favorite is wine.)

185
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,730
You took my keyword.

186
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,399
Drinking by the bottle, I see.

187
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,470
(It's delicious)

188
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,269
(Drinking by the bottle is
the best way to drink.)

189
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,170
This drama is...

190
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,810
filled with quite strong characters.

191
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,879
That was a whole bottle of wine.

192
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,149
There has been another
big change in keywords.

193
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,250
Back in season one,
with just one wig,

194
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,250
Gu Ho Dong went from Gu Ho Dong
to Logan Lee.

195
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,360
(Logan Lee's
ultimate disguise was his wig.)

196
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,659
Hair, hair!

197
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,759
This keyword now goes to...

198
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,360
Shim Su Ryeon.

199
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:52,129
At this point, wigs seem to be
their couple item, don't you think?

200
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,129
(Are wigs their couple item?)

201
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,200
That's a wrap-up of
"Our story inside The Penthouse".

202
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:01,309
Did you root for the same people
you did in season one...

203
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,980
in season two?

204
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,850
I'm a real fan of The Penthouse,

205
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:09,779
and I used to detest Cheon Seo Jin
in season one,

206
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,220
but in season two,
I started to feel bad for her.

207
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,659
Who will I start rooting for...

208
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:20,230
and start hating in the next season?

209
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,529
I'm Jo Jung Sik,
SBS' favorite news anchor.

210
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,269
That was great.

211
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,870
- I just thought of something.
- What is it?

212
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,370
You know how at the start,
we're talking in millions?

213
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,669
- That's right.
- As we kept filming,

214
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,539
20 million dollars started
sounding like nothing.

215
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,049
I see.

216
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,679
Dan Tae, Yoon Chul, and I invest
in real estate,

217
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,450
- and that's 70 million.
- Right.

218
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,820
The three of us decided
that that's too little,

219
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,419
so I think we changed it
to 160 million.

220
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:48,820
We made the numbers
higher like that.

221
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,559
You lose your touch with reality.

222
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,389
It's not even our money.

223
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,230
- We don't even have 30 dollars.
- Exactly.

224
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,230
(Yoon Joo Hee as Ko Sang A)

225
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,399
You lose your touch with reality.

226
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,500
In the clip, we saw...

227
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,570
a lot of crying from So Yeon.

228
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,740
I thought about how exhausting
all of that would've been.

229
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,779
Whenever I was shooting for days,
I'd lose some weight...

230
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,509
and that really stressed me out.

231
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,519
For season two, I'd eat a lot
to prepare myself,

232
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,990
but even just after one scene,
I'd lose it all.

233
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,159
Every scene...

234
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,929
required a lot of energy to film.

235
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,190
I just realized how much I screamed.

236
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,129
I'd like to thank my vocal cords
for not giving out.

237
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,629
And a big change we saw
in season two is...

238
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,370
- Yoon Jong Hun.
- in Ha Yoon Chul.

239
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,139
The emphasis was on "sickly"
in season one,

240
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,009
but now, the emphasis seems
to be on "sexy"...

241
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,740
in the second season.

242
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,379
Sickly sexy.

243
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,750
I feel so awkward now.

244
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,519
Why are you so anxious?

245
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,649
Right.

246
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:56,019
- Could you keep your hands still?
- Sorry.

247
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:58,990
He keeps wiping his hands...

248
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,830
- after we called him sexy.
- Are you trying to show off?

249
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,159
(He's blushing.)

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
Is that what you were doing?
To appeal your sexy charm?

251
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,240
What a sly man you are.

252
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,200
The kids...

253
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,240
also played a huge role
in the drama.

254
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,409
They're the best.

255
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,149
The Penthouse kids...

256
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,049
have sent video greetings
to the cast.

257
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,250
(Video greetings
from The Penthouse kids)

258
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,889
Let's go and watch.

259
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,720
Mom and Dad, I miss you!

260
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:31,289
Hello, Jong Hun and So Yeon!

261
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,289
Have a great shoot today.

262
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,559
I hope that we'll get
to meet again...

263
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,700
as a happy family.

264
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,970
Cheers!

265
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,539
Mom and Dad, Dan Tae
and Su Ryeon.

266
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,440
Thank you for filming with us
in season two.

267
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,639
It was an honor to be acting
on the set with you.

268
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,639
I look forward to filming with you
in Season Three as well.

269
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,809
I miss you.

270
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,149
Have fun with the shoot today!

271
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,279
Cheers!

272
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,620
Mom, Yoon Hee, and Yoon Chul,

273
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,789
who turned out to be my dad,

274
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,350
I'm a little sad...

275
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,389
that I'm not there with you today,

276
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,730
but have fun!

277
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,090
(Dear Oh Yoon Hee and Ha Yoon Chul)

278
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,159
My mom, Ma Ri, who I respect
and love so much,

279
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,570
I'm a little sad that I'm not there
with you right now.

280
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,700
But I'll be rooting for you
from afar.

281
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,340
And Mom, I have a dad now!

282
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,440
(Dear Kang Ma Ri)

283
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,009
Let's make a happy family...

284
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,409
in Season Three.

285
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:30,980
Mom and Dad, I'm so lonely
without you two here.

286
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,320
I'd love to be with you next time.

287
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,190
Good luck with the shoot today.

288
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,320
And Eun Seok,

289
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,129
it's been so long since we last saw
each other.

290
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,360
We're always rooting for you.

291
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,230
- Good luck with the shoot today.
- Good luck!

292
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,200
Good luck!

293
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,539
- We love you!
- Logan, you keep meeting my mom.

294
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:51,769
Right!

295
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,840
- That's right.
- They've got something to say.

296
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,779
You better watch out for me.

297
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,009
- Good luck.
- You're my son!

298
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,309
Cheers, everyone!

299
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,379
- I have a son now too.
- It's weird, seeing them like this.

300
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,649
- They are adorable!
- You could be their new dad.

301
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:06,720
Seok Hoon Lee!

302
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,320
That was a strong comment
at the end.

303
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,730
Seok Kyung and Seok Hoon have...

304
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,159
"You keep meeting my mom."

305
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,730
sent Logan a warning.

306
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,399
- That was a big blow.
- They're warning me.

307
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,500
So,

308
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,470
you're going to get back
with her, right?

309
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,740
I don't know.

310
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,070
I can see from the clip...

311
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:30,039
that they have so much love...

312
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,149
for their moms and dads
in the drama.

313
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,019
You have a huge fandom.

314
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,320
Let's check out the clips...

315
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,289
that The Penthouse kids have
picked out.

316
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,659
(They also gathered again.)

317
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,600
(An adorable and hilarious talk)

318
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:54,730
(The best scenes,
chosen by The Penthouse kids)

319
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,500
When I got the script
for the first episode,

320
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,340
the first thing I read was,
"A girl is dead on the ground."

321
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,740
Right. Ro Na.

322
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,779
(A long-haired girl is dead
on the ground!)

323
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:08,809
They said a girl was lying, dead.

324
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:10,549
I wondered who it would be.

325
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,879
Who would it be?

326
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,850
I never imagined it would be me.

327
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,590
(You're wrong, Bae Ro Na.)

328
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,659
Later on, when I read the script,

329
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,629
it said that Ro Na was dead.

330
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,100
"'Ro Na's dead.'
What, Ro Na's dead?"

331
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,360
"Eun Byeol killed her?"

332
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,840
I was so surprised.

333
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,139
"Then what happens to me?"

334
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,309
- My only connection...
- They all worry about their share.

335
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,110
- Yes. Ro Na is all he has.
- She's my only plot line...

336
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,049
and she dies?

337
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,509
- I did worry about my share.
- See?

338
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,990
I was very shocked and very upset.

339
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,120
(It's okay, Ro Na.)

340
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,590
But I had this slight...

341
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,629
This strong feeling that
she'd come back.

342
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,299
And when the script confirmed it,
I thought, "Okay, great."

343
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,529
Yoon Hee says to Ro Na,

344
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:00,669
"Ro Na, get up."

345
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:03,740
"Mom's so scared."
There's that line in a scene.

346
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,399
Ro Na.

347
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,009
Ro Na. Open your eyes.

348
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,779
(Emotional)

349
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,250
Mom's scared. Open your eyes, Ro Na!

350
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,750
I was supposed to be dead then.

351
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,179
Eugene acted out her part
so emotionally.

352
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:20,220
She was like a real mom.

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,360
- It was a really cold day.
- I was dead and a tear fell.

354
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,960
I remember that.

355
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,029
(Ro Na's most shocking
and emotional scene)

356
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,830
My dad.

357
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,200
Mr. Bong really helped me a lot
with my acting.

358
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,100
In the last episode,

359
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,570
he objects to the sentencing,

360
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,169
and he jumps up and...
Is it called the hammer?

361
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,409
He grabs that and climbs up...

362
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,879
- and jumps.
- That was hilarious.

363
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:47,980
- Joo Dan Tae!
- That was funny.

364
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,120
- I missed it.
- A flying squirrel.

365
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,049
(Kyu Jin the flying squirrel
stood out in this scene.)

366
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,720
Do you know who I am?

367
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,860
I couldn't stop laughing
when he shot that scene.

368
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,220
What would you have done without me?

369
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,759
I will show you!

370
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,100
Kyu Jin even shot some footage
on his own.

371
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,169
- That clip is worth keeping.
- If there were a Korean Joker,

372
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,870
wouldn't that be Bong Tae Gyu?
That's what I think.

373
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,899
What a compliment.

374
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,169
I believed my mom was dead,

375
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,809
and I get to see her again.

376
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,009
(He's reunited with Ro Na and
Su Ryeon whom he thought were dead.)

377
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,980
(Seok Hoon...)

378
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,620
(Mom?)

379
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,590
It's so sad
if you just see the highlights.

380
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,289
I almost cried here.

381
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,230
My gosh.

382
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:41,700
(Mom.)

383
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,139
(I missed you, Seok Hoon.)

384
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,940
Mom.

385
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,509
(I missed you so much.)

386
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,909
From Seok Hoon's standpoint,

387
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:54,779
people he thought were dead
suddenly reappeared.

388
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,419
So I wasn't sure...

389
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,279
- how to portray my feelings.
- That's true.

390
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,320
"Am I dead?"

391
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,190
- I thought I'd be really surprised.
- "Am I dead?"

392
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,259
"I go up to Seo Jin..."

393
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,389
"and do that?"

394
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:08,830
The last scene of episode four.

395
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,299
I can't...

396
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,960
This was a famous scene.

397
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,569
(Seok Kyung blackmails Seo Jin.)

398
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,200
That's why I'm being shameless
and asking you for this favor.

399
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,240
- That scene alone.
- Her Eun Byeol impression's funny.

400
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,240
I thought, "How am I to do this?"

401
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,180
(She pulled it off with
lots of thought and hard work.)

402
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,119
(Look at her act...)

403
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,920
Why did you just run away?

404
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,960
Instead of saving your dad?

405
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
(That's a perfect high act!)

406
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,960
I was so surprised that scene
was the episode's finale.

407
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,059
Shall we restart our discussion?

408
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,369
I imitated Eun Byeol.

409
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,769
She did so well.

410
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,880
- Right? I was surprised.
- The hair thing.

411
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,839
(Her Eun Byeol impression
was talk of the town.)

412
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,509
My dad asked you.

413
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:03,220
That was so funny,
I kept rewatching that part.

414
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
No!

415
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:06,450
- It was funny.
- It was.

416
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,519
(Let's watch it.)

417
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,650
No, no.

418
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,589
- No, no.
- Please.

419
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,119
Do it just once.

420
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,789
(Shudder of embarrassment)

421
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:16,230
- She's so embarrassed.
- Let's watch.

422
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,299
(Channeling Ha Eun Byeol)

423
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,700
(Ha Eun Byeol carbon copy)

424
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,269
Don't make jokes.

425
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,769
My dad asked you.

426
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:28,109
Just let me compete.

427
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,440
You're the director...

428
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:32,339
- She did pretty good.
- That was good.

429
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:33,950
She nailed the details.

430
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,579
Eun Byeol's so sweet.

431
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,049
You're not teasing me,
are you? I'm sorry.

432
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,519
The scene that got me emotional...

433
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,250
was where I confess my baldness.

434
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,690
That was so sad.

435
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,789
(Jenny was bullied so much,
the stress caused hair loss.)

436
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,900
- What... What happened?
- This was so sad.

437
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,000
When did this happen?

438
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,269
Jenny had been through a lot...

439
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,009
in season two.

440
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,980
(She was bullied
throughout the season.)

441
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,849
She'd wanted to tell her mom,

442
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:09,980
but she held back
and then it all came out at once.

443
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,519
Ms. Shin said, "Who did this?"

444
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,490
I crumbled when she said that.

445
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,589
Who was it?

446
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,829
Who did this to my daughter?

447
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,460
Tell me now!

448
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,769
That was so moving.

449
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,500
I watched the episode as a viewer,

450
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,970
and tears kept welling up.

451
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,240
Jenny's acting
alongside Ms. Shin's...

452
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,779
I felt the maternal love
and connection,

453
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,680
and I also felt
just how hard it must've been...

454
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,579
for Jenny and I felt bad for her.

455
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:46,519
Min Hyuk doesn't think or care,

456
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,890
and he just enjoyed what happened.

457
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,920
I think he's
the worst of all the bullies.

458
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,759
I'm so stressed out
because of my character.

459
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,789
(Stressful headache)

460
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,829
On my personal social media account,

461
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,299
I apologized to
all the Min Hyuks nationwide.

462
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,569
Whenever the drama airs,
all the Min Hyuks get chewed out,

463
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,970
and I felt terrible.

464
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,940
In the bathtub in our home,

465
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,339
- I help my mom bathe.
- That scene...

466
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,609
(Jenny found out
what her mom does for a living.)

467
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:15,809
- Keep still.
- That scene was really...

468
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:19,079
I'm so grateful towards Ms. Shin.

469
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,920
That day, I had a lot of trouble
getting into the right mindset.

470
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,589
I heard Ms. Shin's voice
where she's emotional and choked up,

471
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:29,460
and I could feel her trembling
through her back.

472
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,960
That suddenly got me emotional.

473
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,329
Even after we'd finished the scene,

474
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,900
even after we were done,
we both kept crying.

475
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,509
Even after the scene.

476
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:43,480
(It made us think when
we last saw our parents' backs.)

477
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,680
(Which scene
do you remember the most?)

478
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,079
(Every scene in
The Penthouse 2 was special.)

479
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,119
That was lovely.

480
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,690
We were watching the clips
and Eugene...

481
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,960
- She cried.
- Yes.

482
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,490
- That's right.
- Ro Na's death.

483
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,359
We were talking about
your crying scene...

484
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,630
- and you cried again.
- I worried when I got the script.

485
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,500
"I won't be able to stop crying."

486
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,599
That's what I thought.

487
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,500
Because I have a daughter
in real life,

488
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,369
- My gosh.
- It felt...

489
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,109
- Oh, no.
- Yes, right.

490
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,779
To be honest, in my acting career,

491
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,539
I really never wanted to...

492
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,980
play a role in which my child dies.

493
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,819
No one knew that Ro Na would die.

494
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:27,349
So when I got the script...

495
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,890
"I really have to do this."

496
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,089
It's really an emotion
you don't want to experience.

497
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:35,730
Talking about it set her off again.

498
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,000
(She got emotional again.)

499
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,430
(They feel how she felt
during the shoot.)

500
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,500
I'm sorry.

501
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,829
It's fine.

502
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,009
- Talking about it made her cry.
- Excuse me.

503
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:48,009
Who are you?

504
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,509
It's Leon!

505
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,250
- Leon.
- It's Leon.

506
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,549
- A bag instead of a plant.
- It's Leon.

507
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,619
- The greatest scene for me...
- Yes?

508
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,819
is where Kim So Yeon...

509
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:05,559
takes out a phone's SIM card
and chews it.

510
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,099
(The phone contained a video
that incriminated her.)

511
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:15,029
The script said...

512
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:18,000
I flush the SIM card
down the toilet.

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,009
The director said, "So Yeon."

514
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,839
"We prepared a SIM card
made with chewing gum."

515
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,180
"You can chew that
and pretend to swallow it."

516
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,380
So I said, "Okay, I'll do that."

517
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,150
But there was no chewing gum.

518
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,220
- My gosh.
- What?

519
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,119
So I had no choice but to...

520
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,089
actually put the SIM card
in my mouth...

521
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,319
and then pretend to chew it.
The chewing was a mime.

522
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,059
They didn't have the chewing gum.

523
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,299
I was so surprised
when I saw that episode.

524
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,099
- The script...
- It didn't say that.

525
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,829
Right. There was no mention of
chewing a SIM card.

526
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:50,440
I wondered how it came about.

527
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,509
- It was the director's idea.
- It came from our director's head.

528
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:58,440
We've heard people talk about
acting as if one's possessed,

529
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,710
- but our director's possessed too.
- So...

530
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,349
Jong Hun coined a term for
our director's directing.

531
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:08,319
- "Direction of blessing".
- "Direction of blessing".

532
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,059
Whatever the scene,

533
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,390
he just says something...

534
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,390
- and it becomes a great scene.
- Yes.

535
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,130
- He lets the actors shine.
- He gives us an upgrade.

536
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,559
But he's gruff too.

537
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,569
- He gives us all the credit.
- Yes.

538
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,440
But even if he asked
the actor to chew a SIM card,

539
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,710
if the actor refuses,
we wouldn't have had that scene.

540
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,109
- She willingly...
- Yes.

541
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,880
The director could say,
"How about you chew and swallow?"

542
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:35,009
- You could refuse. "No."
- Right.

543
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,619
"I'll suck on it instead."

544
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,119
(Laughing)

545
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,750
- Sucking on it is weird.
- It is a bit.

546
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,359
- She willingly...
- Yes.

547
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,960
- Chew, chew, gulp.
- That's amazing.

548
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,460
- But...
- Oh. Finally.

549
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,230
- My gosh.
- She's here.

550
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,160
Are you Shim Su Ryeon
or Na Ae Gyo?

551
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,930
- Hang on. Her hair...
- Na Ae Gyo?

552
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,329
Shim Su Ryeon.

553
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,900
- Good job.
- Take a seat.

554
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,970
Well done.

555
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,240
She finished her scene.

556
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,210
- Good job.
- Are you done?

557
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,640
- Give her some applause.
- Thanks.

558
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,950
The shoot's officially done, then.

559
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,650
Like Eun Kyung just said,

560
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,849
- is it really now...
- It's really over.

561
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:13,250
Did you run over?

562
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,690
I ran fast. I was in such a hurry.

563
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,819
- I wanted to get here fast.
- People who haven't watched...

564
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:20,789
think you're just Na Ae Gyo.

565
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:22,630
- But... Yes.
- Oh...

566
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,000
My top half is Su Ryeon...

567
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,769
- and my bottom half...
- Na Ae Gyo.

568
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,599
- It's a collaboration.
- I see that.

569
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,069
It's a collaboration.

570
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,170
This was intentional.

571
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,970
You wouldn't know,

572
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,509
but we were talking about
the greatest scenes.

573
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,240
Right now, all I see is
the meat right in front of my eyes.

574
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,680
- Oh, the meat.
- What is that doing there?

575
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,119
- You were looking at the meat?
- Yes.

576
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,549
I thought you were looking at Logan.

577
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:49,859
I found that quite pleasing.

578
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,559
- That's hilarious.
- But you were looking at the meat.

579
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,990
She doesn't care about me.
I'm invisible.

580
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,500
What scene
personally stuck with you?

581
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,200
I'd say the one
where I played two roles.

582
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,670
It was the first time I'd done so,

583
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,869
and it was really hard.

584
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,569
You talked about playing two roles,

585
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:07,309
but she actually played four roles.

586
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,609
She was Na Ae Gyo, Shim Su Ryeon,

587
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,539
Su Ryeon pretending to be Ae Gyo,

588
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:13,950
and Ae Gyo
pretending to be Su Ryeon.

589
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,980
There seem to be
some minute details.

590
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,119
When I play opposite myself,

591
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,390
what Ae Gyo will say and do,

592
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,490
I must take that into consideration
when I play Su Ryeon.

593
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,190
And when I play Ae Gyo,

594
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,099
I have to think about
what Su Ryeon will say and do.

595
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:33,099
When we act, we usually have
someone else to bounce off of.

596
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,970
But I didn't have that this time.
I had to think about everything...

597
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,269
and calculate what to do.

598
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:42,069
That was quite hard,
but it was fun too.

599
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:44,640
Would you play a double role again?

600
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,910
No.

601
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,250
(Is this the first and last time?)

602
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,910
You must've read the script...

603
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,119
where it says that
Joo Dan Tae's arrested.

604
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,390
How did you feel when you read that?

605
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,390
You need an outlet like that
if Season Three is to work.

606
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,720
(It's a must for Season Three!)

607
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:01,890
Oh, so we were all
dressed like prisoners.

608
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,059
We'd gathered around wearing that,

609
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,799
and we talked about how
it was a first and so fascinating.

610
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,029
Yoon Chul said...

611
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:10,769
"I'm used to it."

612
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,869
He had lots of experience.

613
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:14,569
So did I.

614
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,009
I even went on the run.

615
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,980
- That's right.
- They all wore handcuffs...

616
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,509
and what's that rope called?

617
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:22,750
They were tied up in a rope.

618
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,049
It was so funny to
see them all like that.

619
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,589
- That day was the day...
- You were relaxed.

620
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,519
we took the most photos
during filming.

621
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,619
- All of us.
- We were all there.

622
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:34,559
Including the whole shoot...

623
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,000
So now,

624
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,599
we wanted to thank all the actors...

625
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,940
for giving us
all these twists and surprises.

626
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,210
- We prepared an award ceremony.
- That's right.

627
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,809
I want to thank the crew...

628
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:58,650
that put together this special show.

629
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,619
- They prepared gifts.
- Oh.

630
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,190
The item caught Ji Ah's eye
as soon as she entered.

631
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,589
- Is that the real thing?
- It's real.

632
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:09,930
You didn't get much rest
since the first season.

633
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,059
You've been working hard.

634
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,230
Right now, a healthy
immune system is a must.

635
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,099
To boost your immune system,

636
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:19,839
we prepared a full set of
nutritious Korean beef.

637
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,039
We all get it?

638
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,309
- If you win.
- First place only.

639
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,140
- If you win.
- Only one gets it.

640
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,480
- Is there a dud?
- Some get nothing?

641
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,150
If you don't, you must try harder.

642
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,279
(I want it so bad.)

643
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,720
Are you messing with us?

644
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,490
And also, from the set,

645
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,920
the limited edition goods
that you used in Hera Palace.

646
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,089
Look, the Hera Palace goods.

647
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:42,690
- Hera Palace goods...
- That's crazy.

648
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,630
- and nutritious beef.
- No wonder it looked familiar.

649
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,630
Shall we give out the first award?

650
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,930
The first award is called...

651
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,599
A for Effort.

652
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,470
Shall we check out the nominees?

653
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,039
(Hidden Awards: A for Effort)

654
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,640
A for Effort.

655
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,950
Joo Dan Tae.

656
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,980
"Dooly the Little Dinosaur".

657
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,650
Looking over here

658
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,920
And over there

659
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,460
You ruined many childhoods.

660
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:13,430
- But I still can't see
- Carrying a dagger.

661
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,000
Yoon Hee

662
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,200
Yoon Hee

663
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:21,730
Kang Ma Ri, Oh Yoon Hee.

664
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,599
"I Am Not Alone".

665
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,339
(Giggling)

666
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,809
After heavy rain and strong winds

667
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:34,180
- The sun will shine again
- The sun will shine again

668
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,250
Good!

669
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,750
When it hurts too much

670
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,250
- Give a loud shout
- She was in S.E.S.

671
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,230
Lee Kyu Jin, Ko Sang A.
"Morning Dew".

672
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,559
All together!

673
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,970
On the leaves

674
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,700
- "Hee".
- Hee

675
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,640
- Please look at me
- I laughed so much at this.

676
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,710
- You used to
- You used to

677
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,849
- like me
- What a dreadful harmony.

678
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,049
The kind that I love.

679
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,549
- Hee
- Hee

680
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:13,720
You're so serious.

681
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,750
(A for Effort)

682
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,759
Isn't this stiff competition?

683
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,789
- A for Effort.
- Yes.

684
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,130
I can't pick one.

685
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,559
The nominees are all so great.

686
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,130
I think Dooly's a tough one to beat.

687
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,170
Oh... Joo Dan Tae.

688
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,869
It was such an unexpected
song choice.

689
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,140
How did you end up singing that?

690
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,869
- It was improvised.
- Oh, really?

691
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:38,309
The director wanted me to
sing something...

692
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,380
while I was looking for Yoon Hee.

693
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,779
He wanted me to sing
the hide and seek song.

694
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,019
"That might be boring."

695
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:46,750
"Dooly might be fun."
And he went with it.

696
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,490
How did you think of that song?
"Looking over here and there".

697
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,460
- To that...
- Not to mention that...

698
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,029
- Dan Tae sings it so very well.
- Yes.

699
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:56,789
- He's a musical actor.
- Exactly.

700
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:58,460
- It was like...
- Yes.

701
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,269
- It made it a good scene.
- It did.

702
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:02,569
He's a good singer,

703
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:05,039
- so it made it extra chilling.
- Right.

704
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,339
And then you two
singing "Morning Dew".

705
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,509
That's a tough candidate too.

706
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,009
- Was that in the script?
- No.

707
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:14,210
- That too?
- Really?

708
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,109
I came up with the idea.

709
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:17,950
A for Effort...

710
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,920
- is very close.
- Right.

711
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,490
- I'll announce the winner.
- Go ahead.

712
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,920
(Why is this so tense?)

713
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,119
The Penthouse Hidden Awards.

714
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,630
A for Effort goes to...

715
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:30,259
Oh, gosh.

716
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,630
These people got it.

717
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,599
Lee Kyu Jin, Ko Sang A.
Congratulations.

718
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,539
(Congratulations)

719
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,069
(Placid)

720
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,180
- Wow, that's so cool.
- What is this?

721
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,049
All of these? Not just one?

722
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:49,180
It's really all here.

723
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,920
- Of course, it is.
- Is this real?

724
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,420
(I'm so jealous.)

725
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,750
(Flustered)

726
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,450
Thank you so much.

727
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,819
The goods are beautiful.

728
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:00,089
- That's worth it.
- Yes.

729
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:04,359
Us singing "Hee" was improvised too.

730
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,859
We deserve this.

731
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,470
- What a nice wrap-up.
- Kyu Jin!

732
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,299
- Kyu Jin!
- Well said.

733
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,140
I married the right guy.

734
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,809
That's so funny.

735
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,210
You must all wonder why...

736
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,910
Kyu Jin and Sang A won.

737
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,450
They're the only people
who sang two songs,

738
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,819
and their singing...

739
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,619
took up 46 seconds,
the longest of anyone.

740
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,119
That's where the effort comes from,

741
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,519
so we gave them
the A for Effort award.

742
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,630
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

743
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,029
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

744
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,400
Our next award...

745
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,670
is the Fragmented Memory Award.

746
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,900
I know it's unclear what
the award is for,

747
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,500
so let's take a look
at the nominees first.

748
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,309
(Hidden Awards:
Fragmented Memory Award)

749
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:51,210

Cheon Seo Jin.

751
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,220
(I'm not going to beg you for it.)

752
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,450
(Cheon Seo Jin: Says this and that
and changes her mind constantly)

753
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,890
Yoon Hee! Please...

754
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,920
(Bursting into laughter)

755
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,289
(Begging her desperately)

756
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,420
That's so funny.

757
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,759
Please save me, Yoon Hee.

758
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,160
She's very quick to adapt
to her circumstances.

759
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,700
(Says this and that
and changes her mind constantly)

760
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,599
(I'll never go back to you.)

761
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,769
(Bursting into laughter)

762
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,200
(Please stay with me.)

763
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,640
- That was so fast.
- This could only be you.

764
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,109
- Why don't we put those flowers...
- She changed her mind so quickly.

765
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,210
Ma Doo Ki.

766
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,210
- Whoever even touches...
- He is one formidable competitor.

767
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,079
(Ma Doo Ki: There are so many
different mes inside of me.)

768
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,680
(I completely agree with Seok Hoon.)

769
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,880
- That was really funny.
- Guys, how can you be so cold?

770
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,450
Your classmate is dead. How come
no one seems to genuinely grieve?

771
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,660
Seok Hoon, where are you going?

772
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,059
Oh, you're leaving early today?

773
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,190
(Be careful on your way.)

774
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,230
("I will.")

775
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,490
(That's my boy.)

776
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,259
- He's so good at this.
- What are you looking at?

777
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,130
Ha Yoon Chul.

778
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,200
(Ha Yoon Chul:
Different from moment to moment)

779
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,670
(You're not alone anymore.)

780
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,369
(I can't leave you alone here.)

781
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:56,309
(I can't even watch.)

782
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,240
What did I do to deserve you?

783
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,410
At least he's sincere at the moment.

784
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,609
He's so easy.

785
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,180
He just changes from moment
to moment.

786
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,019
Get your hands off of my daughter!

787
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,759
(Can't even lift his head)

788
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,829
- The editing is amazing.
- He's an impressive dad to Ro Na.

789
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:18,029
(Ha Yoon Chul:
Different from moment to moment)

790
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,730
(I'll protect you, Ha Eun Byeol.)

791
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,829
Now he's an impressive
dad to Eun Byeol.

792
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,700
This is amazing, really.

793
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,940
(You're not the same
Ha Yoon Chul of old.)

794

(Hidden Awards:
Fragmented Memory Award)

795
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:29,910
I vote for Ha Yoon Chul.

796
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,680
This is so hilarious.

797
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,140
You're trash.

798
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,380
- The nominees are neck and neck.
- They are.

799
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,519
But to be honest,

800
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,289
we don't know who the winner is
before opening the envelope too.

801
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,660
But this is really tough.

802
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,829
- Yes, everyone's a good nominee.
- It's a close call.

803
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,289
Ha Yoon Chul.

804
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:50,660
- Ha Yoon Chul?
- That piece of trash.

805
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,029
- Oh, the piece of trash.
- He's a strong candidate.

806
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,559
Ji Ah, who do you think
will win this one?

807
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:56,170
- I vote for the trash too.
- Another vote for the trash.

808
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,269
Another vote for the trash...

809
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,839
Now I hope someone else gets it,
instead of the obvious choice.

810
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,970
I think it will be me.

811
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,609
Jong Hun votes for himself.

812
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,410
- He votes for himself too.
- That's right.

813
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:08,650
Will there be an upset?

(Congratulations.)

818
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,889
So this is how it turns out.

819
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,059
Wow, this is great.

820
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,860
Thank you.

821
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,329
This is so funny.

822
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:31,969
Jong Hun, can you tell us
how you feel, winning this award?

823
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,869
I think I deserve it.

824
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:37,380
We're getting a lot of
famous lines out of this.

Oh, that time.

- Right next to him.
- Right next to him...

- No one's seen this yet, right?
- No, no one saw this yet.

giving me a gift in advance.

So is Logan Lee returning
in Season Three?

No one knows.

Didn't we say the same thing
during the season one special?

861
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,170
- This sounds familiar.
- I know.

862
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,369
That's right. The ending...

863
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:13,670
We talked about if Shim Su Ryeon
would be coming back.

864
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,110
It always ends in a cliffhanger.

865
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,880
Logan himself doesn't know yet.

866
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,610
I heard a rumor that I'm not
going to be in it?

867
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,610
So you heard through
a rumor yourself?

868
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,880
That's so hurtful.

- He's like a phoenix.

881
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,480
- That's right.
- I wanted one of these so badly.

882
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,679
What time is it now?

883
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,090
Logan Lee received this award...

884
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,590
because his injuries appeared
the most severe.

885
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,590
He is the winner
of the Sudden Injury Award.

886
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:11,559

00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:39,420
- She wanted to chase down a car.
- What's this music?

900
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,590
I thought you were Forest Gump.

907
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,550
(Applauding herself)

908
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,219

(Hidden Awards

925
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:42,920
You are the hard-working type.

926
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,789
You exercise, drink,

927
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:48,289
then exercise some more.

928
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,929
He's working hard so he can
go drinking healthily.

929
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,030
(He takes care of his health
so he can go drinking.)

930
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,800
He's younger than I am,
but I have a lot of respect for him.

931
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,369
And he even films, on top of that.

932
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:57,500
- Exactly.
- I know.

933
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,570
From the viewers' perspective,

934
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,309
they might think you just ran
for a little bit,

935
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:06,179
- but you shot the scene many times.
- Yes, we filmed several times.

936
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,340
And you were wearing heels.

937
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,880
I drew on my experience
dancing in heels.

938
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,250
- I see.
- Of course.

939
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,519
I should win that award.
I'm in multiple categories.

940
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,190
- That's true.
- You should get it.

941
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,289
So now you're all getting
a bit more ambitious.

942
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,989
The meat has been right in front
of my eyes this whole time.

943
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:21,260
She was really looking
at the meat the whole time.

944
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,000
As someone who really loves
to shoot pool himself,

945
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,699
- How did you see it?
- we usually shoot like this.

946
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:33,099
Usually, we use that pose
when there's really no other way.

947
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:35,869
In my point of view,
She could've just...

948
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:37,579
(Was this necessary?)

949
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:38,710
But she had to do it like that.

950
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,809
(Dong Yeob's tiny but
meaningful analysis)

951
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:41,809
You're so sharp.

952
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,679
Now, who will win?

953
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,820

- Finally.
- Thank you.

960

She couldn't tear her eyes away
from this Korean beef set.

961
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,139
- It does look really tasty.
- It does.

962
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:08,670
Later on, when you eat the beef,

963
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,739
don't just eat it normally,
but go like this.

964
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:11,909
(She is happy even though
she's being teased.)

965
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,139
That's good.

966
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:14,449

the flower of award ceremonies.

972
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,130
This is an award to celebrate
one's hard work.

973
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,260
But as you know,

974
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,429
there's usually only ever
one nominee for this category.

975
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,440
- Now for the award.
- Let's find out who the nominee is.

976

(Hidden Awards: Special Award)

977
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,409
- Special Award.
- Special Award?

978
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:45,809
- It's not an achievement award?

and any method necessary.)

the evil forest around him.)

987

How dare you.

988

989
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,219
- Violence is his everyday?
- Wow.

(If you get in his way,)

996
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:53,309
(he's even willing to kill.)

997
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:54,380
I really love my daughter...

998
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:59,280
(A character full
of resentment and rage)

999
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,820
(The genius villain who made
the public quake at his atrocities)

1000
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,960
It's the Atrocities Award
for best atrocities committed?

1001
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,760
(Joo Dan Tae)

1002
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,960

00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,630
Now for the person who will
receive this award,

1005
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,869
(The Atrocities Award)

1006
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,170
the Atrocities Award...

1007
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,469
This is too funny.

1008
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,010
It goes to Um Ki Joon.
Congratulations.

1009
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,070
(The Atrocities Award goes to

(Delivering the Korean beef set
and other prizes)

1012
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,219
The beef for the Atrocities Award...

1013
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,889
was prepared for you
since last summer.

1014

Please tell us how you feel.

1015

I think I deserve this award.

1016
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,889
(I deserve this award.)

1017
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:41,360
(I made that catch phrase.)

1018
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,489
He did deserve it.

1019
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:45,829
There's even a new slang term
that arose from this.

1020
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,530
"Andante" means slow,
"forte" means strong,

1021
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,699
and "Joo Dan Tae" means...
do you know what it is, So Yeon?

1022
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:51,739
To be cruel?

1023
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,639
- Yes, that's it.
- Yes, that's correct.

1024
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,739
Right now, only Eun Kyung,
Eugene, and So Yeon...

1025
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:59,440
didn't receive any beef sets,

1026
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,679
but we only have one category left.

1027
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:03,949
So there's only one award left?

1028
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,480
Yes, we only have one left.

1029
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,619
But you have two beef sets left,
if you count the producer's.

1030
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,090
(The winners are relaxed.)

1031
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,789

1032
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:15,030

- This is a famous scene.
- It really is.

1038
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,010
(Helicopter: Made The Penthouse 2
a blockbuster)

1039
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,010
Was it really rotating?

1040
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,480
That day, the scene was so fun.

1041
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,110
Really?

1042

- They had three strong fans.
- I was watching from above.

1043
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:39,050
Oh, this was done with fans.

1044
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,820
- With a real helicopter.
- There was a real helicopter too.

1045
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,489
- I see.
- Wow.

1046
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,260
- That was a great scene.
- That feels great.

1047

The Ma Ri Sauna.

1048
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,760
- That's right.
- Clip my toenails too.

1049
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,260
- That was a famous line.
- For the ladies with me too.

1050
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,000
Who dares to insult Ms. Jincheon?

1051
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,969
- Wow, so scary.
- Who was it?

1052
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,610
I won't use the same water
as political sewer rats.

1053
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,940
Replace the water in the tubs.

1054
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,809
Drain the tubs!

1055
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:08,650
- That was so refreshing.
- Wow.

1056
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,750
The first appearance.

1057
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,119
(Shim Su Ryeon? Na Ae Gyo?)

1058
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,179
Who are you?

1059
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,489
So impressive.

1060
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:20,860
Shim Su Ryeon?

1061
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,190
She kisses him at first sight.

1062
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,699
- It was a strong first appearance.
- There's this rumor saying that...

1063
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,570
Um Ki Joon directed
this drama himself.

1064
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,710
How have you been?

1065
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,670
It's been a while,

1066
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,539
Joo Dan Tae.

1067
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,780
Shadow singer.

1068
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:49,090
(Shadow singer: The perfect high F)

1069
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:54,690
(Perfectly memorized)

1070
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,579
I don't believe this.

1071
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,050
That was a perfect high F.

1072
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:25,019
(Hidden Awards:
Ratings Improvement Award)

1073
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:27,590
Our nominees are all impressive.

1074
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,659
I wonder which it will be?

1075
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,260
Furthermore, for our nominees,

1076
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,530
we combined the ratings,

1077
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,000
the VOD searches, and scenes
chosen by viewers...

1078
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,570
to come up with our nominees.

1079
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,099
Now,

1080
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,440
the winner is...

1081
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,409
(The Ratings Improvement Award
goes to...)

1082
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:49,449
The production crew is amazing.

1083
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:50,610
Truly amazing.

1084
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,849
Are they going to give it
to everyone?

1085
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,320
I saw everything from the front.

1086
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,519
Now, the winner is...

1087
00:45:58,289 --> 00:45:59,389
There is no winner.

1088
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,920
(There is no winner of
the Ratings Improvement Award.)

1089
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,159
Instead of choosing a winner,

1090
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,599
they're saying everyone is a winner.

1091
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,130
We can't leave anyone out
when we talk about...

1092
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,769
- improving the ratings.
- That's true.

1093
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,599
Is that the Korean beef?

1094
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,639
We need one more.

1095
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1096
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,909
(They bring the last one
to the stage as well.)

1097
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:20,940
Oh, my gosh.

1098
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:23,579
Wait, who is it?

1099
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,949
- What is this?
- It's writer Kim Soon Ok.

1100
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:28,449
Really?

1101
00:46:28,449 --> 00:46:29,650
- Wow.
- What is this?

1102
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,949
What is this?

1103
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,820
Wow, really?

1104
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,920
(It's the real Kim Soon Ok.)

1105
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,489
- Nice to see you.
- Wow.

1106
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:36,590
(It's the real Kim Soon Ok.)

1107
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,329
- My gosh, it's true.
- Where are you going? Catch her.

1108
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,829
Catch her.

1109
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:43,329
You have to catch her.

1110
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:44,900
That was so moving.

1111
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,940
(Writer Kim Soon Ok surprise visits
the actors to show her support.)

1112
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,840
Thank you for all of your
hard work, everyone.

1113
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,170
(Everyone, thank you
for all your hard work.)

1114
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,880
You're the best, Ms. Kim.

1115
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,280
Thank you so much.

1116
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,179
I was so surprised.

1117
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:00,619
She came herself because
of the circumstances.

1118
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,889
Because of COVID-19,
we couldn't do readings together,

1119
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:05,760
- or drink tea or anything.
- Or gather together.

1120
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,619
- Everyone wanted to see her.
- That's right.

1121
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,760
But for her to show up so suddenly,

1122
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,429
I doubted my own eyes.

1123
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:12,960
- I was so surprised.
- Right.

1124
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,300
That's so touching.

1125
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,099
In order to alleviate
some of those regrets,

1126
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,769
- we decided to have this event.
- That's right.

1127
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,170
Thank you.

1128
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,239
Congratulations.

1129
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1130
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:27,010
Bringing writer Ms. Kim here
was the ultimate gift for us.

1131
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,809
- That's true.
- It really was.

1132
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:33,050
- Season Three...
- I have no idea.

1133
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:37,219
I'm also really curious about
where Eun Byeol went.

1134
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:38,219
But...

1135
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,960
Ms. Jin has a line
where she says to me,

1136
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,789
"Mom will..."

1137
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,860
- So maybe it's my real mother.
- What?

1138
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,699
Or not.

1139
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,170
- Since it's the last season,
- You're really shocked.

1140
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,769
- He looks like Ahn Yeon Hong.
- a lot will happen.

1141
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:52,800
Evil will be overcome.

1142
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,610
- New faces will appear.
- Then who am I?

1143
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,809
Jenny's father will appear.

1144
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:00,510
My father and Joo Dan Tae's
relationship.

1145
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,880
These things might be
further developed...

1146
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,780
in the story.

1147
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,579
My father will come out
no matter what.

1148
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:09,849
Whether that's through
a prison break,

1149
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:11,260
- or through bribes.
- Bingo.

1150
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,159
- She's right on the nose.
- No matter what.

1151
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:16,460
If there's something I hope for,
I hope Yoon Hee...

1152
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,030
accepts her punishment,

1153
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,530
and even if they don't have
much money,

1154
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,030
I hope she lives happily
ever after with Ro Na.

1155
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:26,739
Ro Na should be happy now.

1156
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:29,010
Instead of always wondering
if she's dead or alive,

1157
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,510
I hope she has more
enjoyable, fun scenes.

1158
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,949
I want to be friends
with Ro Na again,

1159
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:36,179
and clear up the misunderstandings
that have arisen so far.

1160
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,619
Both of our moms are in jail,

1161
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:41,849
so it would be nice
if we could lean on each other.

1162
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:42,889
(How sharp of her)

1163
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,659
- That's my personal opinion.
- Even though her mom's in jail,

1164
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:45,889
- she looks pretty happy.
- How about me?

1165
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,630
- But you betrayed her first!
- She's my daughter.

1166
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,889
Oh, no.

1167
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:52,199
I thought I'd get married to him
in Season Three.

1168
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:54,000
(Giggling)

1169
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,300
I heard through some rumors...

1170
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,900
that Min Hyuk would grow up.

1171
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,900
(Totally interested)

1172
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,969
What did you say?

1173
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,739
Min Hyuk would grow up.

1174
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:02,739
Min Hyuk's growing up?

1175
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,739
Wow, finally.

1176
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:05,940
(Hooray.)

1177
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,179
- That's great.
- Applause.

1178
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,380
I really hope so.

1179
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,980
I'm so stressed out
because of my character.

1180
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,349
- Oh, no. So sad.
- I guess he saw the comments.

1181
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:19,090
The kids have told us
what they're hoping for...

1182
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,690
on the next season.

1183
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,659
But Jin Bun Hong...

1184
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:25,300
At first,

1185
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,699
I thought she was just someone...

1186
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:30,630
- who came because Logan called.
- Right.

1187
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,900
But her attitude towards
Eun Byeol is really...

1188
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,639
- That's right.
- And there is...

1189
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,510
a theory that she's Eun Byeol's
real mother.

1190
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,570
What did you say?

1191
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:39,210
(They love her fake acting.)

1192
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,809
There's no way.

1193
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:43,909
Yoon Chul did it again?

1194
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,349
My, Yoon Jong Hun.

1195
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:49,489
What kind of a jerk are you?

1196
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:52,190
That will end up being
a totally new story.

1197
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,389
No one knows anything
about Season Three.

1198
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:58,829
I want Kyu Jin to change a bit.

1199
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,469
- In what way?
- In season one,

1200
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:04,599
he was the comic foil,
somewhere between fun and evil,

1201
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:07,699
and in season two, he was mostly
just a comic character.

1202
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,570
I'm not sure if I can say this,

1203
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,809
but I've run out of
funny things to do.

1204
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,780
Personally, I'd like to see..

1205
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,780
some change in Kyu Jin's character.

1206
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,019
Our family was the most solid
and harmonious...

1207
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,920
through season two.

1208
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,860
I'm wondering if that will
continue in Season Three.

1209
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,559
You're getting anxious.

1210
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,929
Is Min Hyuk really my son?

1211
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:32,559
- Yes, exactly.
- That gave me goosebumps.

1212
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,599
- Every kids...
- It was Yoon Chul.

1213
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:38,300
It was Yoon Chul again.
Ha Yoon Chul, really.

1214
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,070
What are you going around doing?

1215
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:44,570
I had a dream from long ago.

1216
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,710
Now that we're heading
to Season Three,

1217
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:51,449
when we saw the kids' interview,

1218
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,880
I realized how much...

1219
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,889
those children had grown
over the course of a year.

1220
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,420
I imagined for a moment...

1221
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,530
how their kids might look like...

1222
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,960
in season 10.

1223
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,300
If we could film 2 seasons
in 1 year...

1224
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,030
Just as Eun Kyung said,

1225
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,539
if we could have The Penthouse
continue on SBS...

1226
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,070
like "Country Diaries"...

1227
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,340
We grew up with Bok Gil,

1228
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,710
and followed his character
as it grew up too.

1229
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,880
My dream has really come true.

1230
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,610
I'm really very happy.

1231
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:24,079
But on top of that, to have
so much love from viewers...

1232
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,980
That's true. There is always
something like that.

1233
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,250
It ends when you think
you're finally getting along.

1234
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,019
Elders used to say, "You run out of
rice when you have appetite".

1235
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:34,489
(She loves his jokes.)

1236
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,829
Did people say that
back in the days?

1237
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:38,559
You run out of rice
when you have appetite.

1238
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,469
- That's very sad.
- Yes. It's very sad.

1239
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:44,900
It's very sad.
And you appease your hunger...

1240
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,599
- through season 2 and 3.
- Yes.

1241
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,840
What about you, Dan Tae?

1242
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,210
He will somehow crawl out of prison.

1243
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,849
He'll somehow escape from there
and find the penthouse back.

1244
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:56,349
And he'll take revenge on her.

1245
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:58,179
Su Ryeon...

1246
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:00,519
lived as Ae Gyo.

1247
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:03,389
So I'm expecting Su Ryeon...

1248
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:06,190
to upgrade...

1249
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,559
with Na Ae Gyo's attitude.

1250
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,130
She thought her revenge was over,

1251
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,230
but it starts again...

1252
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,730
with Logan's death.

1253
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:19,369
I want her to take bigger revenge.

1254
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,699
"Bigger revenge".

1255
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:23,110
- You're not satisfied yet?
- No.

1256
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,769
What's supposed to happen to me?

1257
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,179
Eugene. What about you?

1258
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,750
As of now, all my problems
are solved.

1259
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,619
I've paid for my crime
that I suffocated me.

1260
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:38,090
I went to prison.

1261
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,389
I thought Su Ryeon was dead,
but she came back alive.

1262
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,889
Now I know that
my daughter is alive.

1263
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:46,199
I feel like...

1264
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,969
I can really enjoy my time
in prison.

1265
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:52,070
So I'm really curious...

1266
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,739
what I can do in the drama.

1267
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:57,440
Right. Is there anything...

1268
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,909
you expect to happen?

1269
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:02,650
Maybe a relationship with anyone?

1270
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,679
Should I look in Tae Gyu's eyes?

1271
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,349
(Interested)

1272
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,320
- What about me?
- But Ki Joon...

1273
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,449
- She's surprised.
- We were the perfect couple for...

1274
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:14,219
two seasons in a row.
What's happening to me?

1275
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:16,829
Honestly, I think Yoon Hee's
sick of men.

1276
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:20,059
- No more?
- No more. Go away.

1277
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,300
(Cutting off her ties
with Ha Yoon Chul)

1278
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,300
Ha Yoon Chul's nickname is
the Korean Charlie Chaplin.

1279
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,869
Charlie Chaplin had
dozens of children.

1280
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,940
So in the next seaon,

1281
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,179
we have to focus on
how many children Ha Yoon Chul has.

1282
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,449
Okay.

1283
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,579
- Just kidding.
- Yes.

1284
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:41,019
Do you want a happy ending
with Cheon Seo Jin...

1285
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:43,690
or Oh Yoon Hee?

1286
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,090
Who do you have in your heart?
Let's say it for fun.

1287
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,960
- For fun?
- Of course.

1288
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,599
She said she doesn't need me,
so I choose her.

1289
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,500
He carried it inside himself.

1290
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,869
- I don't need you.
- He's hurt.

1291
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,340
You take him.

1292
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,869
Come to charming Kyu Jin.

1293
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:03,469
(Kyu Jin doesn't miss his chance.)

1294
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:05,480
Call me when you're lonely.

1295
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,309
This is crazy.

1296
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,710
- Logan Lee.
- Yes.

1297
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,750
- In Season Three?
- Yes.

1298
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,019
As you saw...

1299
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:16,449
- Are you dead or live?
- I know.

1300
00:54:16,449 --> 00:54:21,090
If I return,
I'd probably take revenge.

1301
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,530
He went after me this time.

1302
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,960
So it's going to get
a little more personal.

1303
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:28,300
That's what I expect.

1304
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,969
If not,

1305
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,869
I'll enjoy watching
Season Three at home.

1306
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,739
You go back to being a viewer.

1307
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,809
He said those things,

1308
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:41,309
but what he desperately wants is
that he wants to live.

1309
00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:42,610
(What Logan Lee really wants
is to survive.)

1310
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,349
- The last episode was a bit...
- He wishes he didn't die.

1311
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,650
I hope you return
by all means necessary.

1312
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,219
Yes. Thank you.

1313
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:52,960
The production crew mentioned...

1314
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,730
about Season Three...

1315
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,960
that neither the actors...

1316
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,860
- nor we know.
- Right.

1317
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,429
Really?

1318
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,969
They said...

1319
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,670
- the actors are very curious...
- Yes.

1320
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,610
and they'll like it too.

1321
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:13,110
But it's not about what we expect...

1322
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,010
or what the rumors say.

1323
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,880
We got the script.

1324
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,219
- What?
- It's shocking.

1325
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:21,579
- This is real.
- Not even the actors know.

1326
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:24,090
- You've never seen it before.
- We haven't received it yet.

1327
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,260
I'm getting goosebumps.

1328
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,920
The script is so thick.

1329
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,230
- He must be really curious.
- I'm utterly shocked.

1330
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,260
- I can't wait to read it.
- It's so shocking.

1331
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,900
Has it been printed?

1332
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,099
Only two scripts have been printed.

1333
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,230
Only Writer Kim Soon Ok,

1334
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,139
- Director Ju Dong Min...
- I should read that before I go.

1335
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:42,869
and the two of us know
what it's about.

1336
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:45,579
I can't believe it.

1337
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,179
Season Three.

1338
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,409
(The script won't be shared
for security.)

1339
00:55:48,409 --> 00:55:49,579
Episode One.

1340
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:51,610
(Surprised)

1341
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,019
Seriously.

1342
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:55,420
- Why did I close my eyes?
- Take it away!

1343
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,820
- Why did I close my eyes?
- Take it, So Yeon.

1344
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,360
Can you read one, please?

1345
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,860
Should I check if Eun Seok's in it?

1346
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:09,070
I don't quite like...

1347
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:12,500
acting childish.

1348
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,139
- But...
- You're going to act childish.

1349
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,210
I'm serious.

1350
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,269
(Reading the script)

1351
00:56:18,269 --> 00:56:19,909
- I'm curious.
- What does it say?

1352
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:24,250
- Joo Dan Tae!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1353
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,250
- Joo Dan Tae!
- Seriously.

1354
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,889
If you have anything sharp,
give it to me.

1355
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:33,289
Joo Dan Tae! Seriously, Joo Dan Tae.

1356
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:35,929
He's really annoying.

1357
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,260
Look. This is what happens.

1358
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,159
- This is what happens.
- I'm not curious.

1359
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:42,929
Look what happens here.

1360
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:47,699
- I'm curious.
- What?

1361
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,369
(What's Season 3 Episode 1 about?)

1362
00:56:49,769 --> 00:56:51,239
- That's intense.
- My goodness.

1363
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:52,880
This episode...

1364
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,610
is the most shocking...

1365
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,849
- first episode so far.
- Right.

1366
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:00,849
- As an incident occurs,
- Again?

1367
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:03,250
Season Three begins.

1368
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,420
Something amazing is going to happen
in here.

1369
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,460
Will Seol A come back alive?

1370
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,460
That's not a statue.

1371
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,590
- It wasn't a statue.
- It's been watching all along.

1372
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,429
- A person in body painting?
- Yes.

1373
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,170
- "Body painting".
- Is it an actor?

1374
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,099
It's Seo Jang Hoon in disguise.

1375
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,170
That's possible.

1376
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,610
- The statue comes alive?
- If the statue moves...

1377
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,369
Is there a dead body
inside the statue?

1378
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:25,739
(Surprised)

1379
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:29,010
- That's a reasonable doubt.
- Oh, I know.

1380
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,179
Does it start
with Joo Dan Tae's death?

1381
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:33,420
- What?
- I think it's me.

1382
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,650
- What?
- What?

1383
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,590
Because I killed Min Seol A.

1384
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,690
- Oh, that's right.
- You read it.

1385
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:39,960
- You're right.
- You read the script.

1386
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,059
Don't act like you didn't read it.

1387
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,130
No.

1388
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,460
Logan Lee said no.

1389
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,059
I think there's a dead body
inside it.

1390
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:49,469
I was thinking...

1391
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,030
where the dead body could be.

1392
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,869
When you break it,

1393
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:56,969
a woman lies inside just like that.

1394
00:57:56,969 --> 00:57:58,269
In that shape?

1395
00:57:58,269 --> 00:58:00,840
My goodness. In that shape?

1396
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,250
Let me give you a heads up.

1397
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,019
Let's not air this.
Let's just share it with actors.

1398
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:09,489
- No. We can't.
- It's okay.

1399
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:10,849
No, we can't.

1400
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:12,719
As the statue breaks,

1401
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:15,860
a man who looks just like it
walks out.

1402
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,860
(She got fooled.)

1403
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,599
That's actually a man.

1404
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,760
(She didn't get fooled.)

1405
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,199
- Gosh.
- Oh, that's the secret.

1406
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:24,469
It wasn't a woman. It was a man.

1407
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:25,769
It's not the statue of Hera,

1408
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,599
- but Hercules.
- Is it the statue of Zeus?

1409
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,739
- "Hercules".
- Is that true?

1410
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:31,840
- It says in here.
- What a shocking twist.

1411
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,480
As the statue of Hera breaks,
Hercules comes out.

1412
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:39,719
My goodness. I can't wait to say it.

1413
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,289
The Penthouse 3...

1414
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:44,949
will begin in early June.

1415
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,090
When it starts to get hot,

1416
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,360
watch The Penthouse 3
and cool things off.

1417
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,059
Do we get to meet again
for The Penthouse 3 Special?

1418
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:57,369
See you in The Penthouse 3.

1419
00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:01,039
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1420
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:03,639
I don't think I have a chance
to say this...

1421
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,940
unless I say it now.

1422
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,179
The Penthouse production crew
worked really hard.

1423
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,349
Including Director Ju
and Writer Kim,

1424
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:13,280
directing team, filming team,
lighting team,

1425
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,019
audio team,
props team and arts team.

1426
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:17,719
As the shoot continued
for over a year,

1427
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:20,789
all actors really pulled it off.

1428
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:23,489
I hope the viewers know that.

1429
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:25,159
And please give us
a lot of compliments.

1430
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:26,929
I thought...

1431
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,730
it'd make my day if I could say it.

1432
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:31,769
You won't edit it out, will you?
Please air it.

1433
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:35,369
- Please air it. Promise.
- Thank you.

1434
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,769
(Please look forward to
The Penthouse 3.)
