62
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:14,019
As you saw through the video,

63
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,820
I intend to find all the things that
are hidden inside...

64
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,130
The Penthouse
through HePal's Code.

65
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,630
There are a lot of stories
that are floating around already.

66
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,600
There are.
There are a lot of guesses too.

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,399
I wondered if the premise
of this drama...

68
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,970
has a special code.

69
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,040
That's what I thought.

70
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,369
- The premise.
- Yes, the premise.

71
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:36,239
I believe the HePal's Code
to the premise...

72
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,839
is "The Divine Comedy".

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,809
- "The Divine Comedy"?
- "The Divine Comedy".

74
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,350
What comes to mind when you
think of "The Divine Comedy"?

75
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,880
What comes to mind when I think
about "The Divine Comedy"?

76
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,250
- Dante?
- Yes, that's right.

77
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,649
- Dante.
- Dante.

80
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,630
It was Joo Dan Tae.

81
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:55,889

84
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,899

87
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,739
Who is the king of the gods
in Greek mythology?

88
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,380
- Zeus.
- Zeus.

89
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,480
Another name for Zeus is...

90
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,609
<font color="#ffff00">IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY,
HIS NAME IS ZEUS.</font>

91
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,480
- It's Jupiter.
- It's Jupiter. Bingo.

92
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,380
- So that's why he's Joo Dan Tae?
- Right.

93
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,450
I see.

94
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,950
I didn't hear anything about that.

95
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,320
That might be how he got
his name, but I'm not aware of it.

96
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,989
Right. Zeus.
That's why we wondered...

97
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,299
if Dan Tae was Zeus
among ourselves.

98
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:30,700
- Is that so?
- Tell us about that.

99
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,929
- That's a good story.
- It happened so long ago.

100
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:36,140
We talked about it at the beginning
of Season One, so I don't remember.

101
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,670
And...

102
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,439
in Korean, it was translated as
"The Divine Music".

103
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,879
In other words,
it's the music of divine beings.

104
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,210
In the drama, they do vocal music.

105
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,280
The music of divine beings,
vocal music.

106
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,980
<font color="#ffff00">A BIG PREMISE IN THE PENTHOUSE

FROM DANTE'S "THE DIVINE COMEDY"?</font>

108
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,520
And there's something that
Joo Dan Tae says often.

109
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,619
<font color="#ffff00">IF YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG,
OF COURSE YOU SHOULD GET PUNISHED.</font>

110
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,759
If you're finished enjoying yourself
like a reckless brat,

111
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,160
it's time to be punished.

112
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,999
A woman like you must be punished.

113
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,369
<font color="#ffff00">PUNISHMENT</font>

114
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,009
- He acts like a divine being...
- Right.

115
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,939
and says that he will punish people.

116
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,840
That's right. In mythology,

117
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,780
Zeus' wife is Hera.

118
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,150
- Hera.
- Is that why it's Hera Palace?

119
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,580
- Then it connects to Hera.
- I know.

120
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,790
Hera is the goddess of family,

121
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,259
- but she's also extremely jealous.
- That's right.

122
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,629
Let's think about the people
who live in Hera Palace.

123
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,199
They always fight...

124
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,699
and conspire against each other,

125
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,470
but none of them have a goal.

126
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,299
- Come to think of it, you're right.
- They don't have a goal.

127
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,640
That person may not have done
anything to me,

128
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,939
but for some reason,
I don't like them.

129
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,580
I have no reason to dislike them,
but I do.

130
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,609
I think it might be an extension
of those feelings.

131
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:55,210
He's just someone who's hated
within Hera Palace.

132
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,280
<font color="#ffff00">IF YOU LOOK INTO THOSE FEELINGS...</font>

133
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,280
He's just someone you can't
relate to. It could be that.

134
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,449
It's just jealousy.

135
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,489
You just don't want to see
that person succeed.

136
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:03,559
They're just fighting.

137
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,059
It's like a dog fight.

138
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,330
But the most representative person
is Cheon Seo Jin.

139
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,160
- Cheon Seo Jin.
- Cheon Seo Jin.

140
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,160
The reason why Cheon Seo Jin
stole Ha Yoon Chul away...

141
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,199
wasn't because she loved him.

142
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,799
It was simply because she was
jealous he was dating Oh Yoon Hee.

143
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,170
- Right. That was all.
- Right.

144
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,210
Furthermore, the reason why she
had an affair with Joo Dan Tae...

145
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,609
was because...

146
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:24,679
she wanted to take Shim Su Ryeon's
husband from her.

147
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,679
It was like that.

148
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:28,049
- Not because she loved him.
- Right.

149
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,480
<font color="#ffff00">ALL MEN ARE THE SAME.</font>

150
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,679

155
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,259
I agree. Now that I made...

156
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,900
the connection between
jealousy and Hera Palace,

157
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,100
the story seems to fall into place.

158
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,699
However, I still don't understand
why Dan Tae is Dante.

159
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,109
The notion that Dante, the author
of "The Divine Comedy",

160
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,970
has been absorbed into
this premise...

161
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,739
- can be defined by this.
- What is it?

162
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,109
Joo Dan Tae...

163
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,850
- is obsessed with Shim Su Ryeon.
- Right.

164
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,949
He murdered her previous husband.

165
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,189
<font color="#ffff00">AFTER MURDERING
HER PREVIOUS HUSBAND,</font>

166
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:14,530
<font color="#ffff00">THE REASON WHY HE INSISTED
ON CUTTING OFF HIS FINGER IS...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">THE MOMENT I SAW THE WEDDING RING
ON HIS FINGER,</font>

168
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,270
<font color="#ffff00">I TOTALLY LOST MY MIND.</font>

169
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,799
How dare he steal you from me?

170
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,009
The fact that you were pregnant
with his baby...

171
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,309
made me want to tear his heart
into pieces.

172
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,980
<font color="#ffff00">DAN TAE EXHIBITS A MAD OBSESSION.</font>

173
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:40,049
That's right.
Dan Tae is extremely obsessive.

174
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,460
Actually, Dante was
a very obsessive man too.

175
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,429
He met his first love
when he was nine.

176
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,929
His obsession with her continued
into adulthood...

177
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,900
even after they both got married.

178
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Her name is Beatrice.

179
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:55,530
Dante's obsession with her
was persistent.

180
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,569
<font color="#ffff00">"DANTE WOULDN'T HAVE LONGED FOR
BEATRICE ALL HIS LIFE..."</font>

181
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,400
<font color="#ffff00">"IF HE'D LIVED WITH HER."
DANTE'S WIFE, GEMMA DONATI</font>

182
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,770
Let's just forget about everything.

183
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,049
<font color="#ffff00">DAN TAE OBSESSES OVER THINGS
THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE.</font>

184
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,449
I'm going to take your silence
as a yes.

185
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,920
<font color="#ffff00">WAS THE CHARACTER INSPIRED
BY DANTE'S OBSESSION?</font>

186
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,319
It doesn't end there.

187
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,390
After Dante was expelled
from Florence for political reasons,

188
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,030
he stayed...

189
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,960
in an Italian city called Verona.

190
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,699
- Verona?
- Verona.

191
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,199
- Yoon Hee's daughter is Bae Ro Na.
- Bae Ro Na.

192
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,640
- Bae Ro Na.
- Exactly.

193
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,170
Ro Na!

194
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,040
Ro Na!

195
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:35,869
Bae Ro Na!

196
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,040
<font color="#ffff00">THE NAME BAE RO NA IS
JUST AS RARE AS JOO DAN TAE.</font>

197
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:45,220
<font color="#ffff00">DOES THE NAME BAE RO NA
CONTAIN HEPAL'S CODE?</font>

198
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:48,150
<font color="#ffff00">BUT...</font>

199
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,990
"Romeo and Juliet" by Shakespeare...

200
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,059
is also set in Verona.

201
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,959
- That's another connection.
- Exactly.

202
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,900
What is "Romeo and Juliet" about?

203
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,900
- The two are in love, but...
- They can't stay together.

204
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,270
- Their families are enemies.
- That's right.

205
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,799
What does that remind you of?

206
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,439
Seok Hoon and Ro Na.

207
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,170
- Seok Hoon and Ro Na.
- Yes.

208
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,140
<font color="#ffff00">THE TWO START DEVELOPING
FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER.</font>

209

212
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,589

DANTE AND "ROMEO AND JULIET"?</font>

213
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,319
<font color="#ffff00">THEN...</font>

214
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,660
They probably don't end up together.

215
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:26,959
Will they die?

216
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,189
Exactly. Not ending up together
isn't the real problem.

217
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:31,500
Both Romeo and Juliet die
in the end.

218
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,900
I hope we don't have a tragic end.

219
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,370
Every time I receive a new script,

220
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,500
I'm scared that I'll die.

221
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,969
That's interesting.

222
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:42,979
- Even Ro Na has many implications.
- Right?

223
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,209
If the writer really did intend it,

224
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:47,410
I'd get goosebumps.

225
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,750
This is incredible.

226
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,479
- There's another interesting name.
- Another?

227
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,589
Shim Su Ryeon.

228
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:55,150
What does her name mean?

229
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,219
Su Ryeon means water lilies,
which grow in the mud.

230
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,059
- You didn't know?
- You could say...

231
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,160
the Hera Palace people are
always fighting in the mud.

232
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,530
Su Ryeon must be a water lily
that grows in that mud.

233
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:07,530
- Shim Su Ryeon.
- She's an elegant water lily.

234
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,170
She rarely wears colorful clothes.

235
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,969
- She often wears white.
- Like you today.

236
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:14,839
It's the Shim Su Ryeon style.

237
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,610
I thought it was
the Jung Won Kwan style.

238
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,179
"Last night, I started hating you."

239
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,750
- All right.
- Okay.

240
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,349
I've prepared so much
about names.

241
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:24,880
- Do you have any?
- I do.

242
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,290
Do you remember
Min Seol A's English name?

243
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,819
- I do.
- What is it?

244
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,360
- It's Anna Lee.
- Yes.

245
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,059
Anna means grace in Hebrew.

246
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,900
- You're talking about Hebrew now?
- Yes, I did some research.

247
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:43,839
Starting today, your name is Anna.
Anna Lee.

248
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:47,110
<font color="#ffff00">HER ADOPTIVE PARENTS
NAMED HER ANNA LEE.</font>

249
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,910
From her adoptive
parents' perspective,

250
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,410
Min Seol A is the person
who can save their son.

251
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,110
That's why her name means grace.

252
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,179
That's where her name, Anna,
comes from.

253
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,990
- Don't you think it's far-fetched?
- I guess it is.

254
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:03,520
But who knows? The writer
may have really thought that way.

255
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,589
- Then I have another one.
- Go ahead.

256
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,189
- Gu Ho Dong.
- Gu Ho Dong.

257
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,890
- Logan Lee.
- Yes, Logan Lee.

258
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,199
The name Gu Ho Dong was
inspired by Kang Ho Dong.

259
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,429
<font color="#ffff00">GU HO DONG WAS
INSPIRED BY KANG HO DONG.</font>

260
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:13,569
- Cut it out.
- Okay.

261
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:15,329
- I mean...
- What are you doing?

262
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:17,540
There's evidence. I wouldn't have
brought it up otherwise.

263
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,010
One of the things that
Gu Ho Dong says most often is,

264
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,240
"Nice to meet you."

265
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,839
He even said,
"Nice to meet you, brother" once.

266
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,280
That's right.

267
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,479
<font color="#ffff00">HE REALLY SAID,
"NICE TO MEET YOU, BROTHER."</font>

268
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:32,380
And the name Kang Ho Dong was
even mentioned in the show.

269
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,049
- I don't remember hearing it.
- It was.

270
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,790
<font color="#ffff00">LOGAN LEE WAS ABDUCTED BY DAN TAE
IN SEASON 1, EPISODE 21.</font>

271
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:43,059
That came out wrong.

272
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Kang Ho Dong, no,
Gu Ho Dong, right?

273
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,929
<font color="#ffff00">DID YOU GET THAT?</font>

<font color="#ffff00">ONE MORE TIME</font>

275
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:50,569
That came out wrong.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,240
Kang Ho Dong, no,
Gu Ho Dong, right?

277
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,010
<font color="#ffff00">WAS THE NAME GU HO DONG REALLY
INSPIRED BY KANG HO DONG?</font>

278
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,410
That was my ad-lib.

279
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:00,150
The original line was,
"Gu Ho Dong, no. Logan Lee, right?"

280
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,780
But I changed it to Kang Ho Dong.

281
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,979
<font color="#ffff00">THIS HEPAL'S CODE WAS
BASED ON HIS AD-LIB.</font>

282
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,219
But the director just went with it.

283
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,319
But this one is...

284
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,260
too hard to catch.

285
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,890
Don't you agree? It was too fast.

286
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,260
Dan Tae didn't say it
clearly either.

287
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:16,760
"Kang Ho Dong, no..."
He corrected himself right away.

288
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,599
I never make ungrounded claims.

289
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,270
- All right. It's accepted.
- Okay.

290
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,400
The next HePal's Code is...

291
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,339
- original sin.
- Original sin.

292
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,770
Original sin.

293
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,839
- You're good at English.
- No, I'm not.

294
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,380
Are you talking about "sin"...

295
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,880
- Original sin.
- Yes.

296
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,949
Or are you talking about "scene",

297
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,449
like in movies and dramas?

298
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:40,549
The meaning would depend on that.

299
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,219
- Do you want me to answer?
- Yes.

300
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:43,719
Both.

301
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,160
<font color="#ffff00">BOTH</font>

302
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,860
It's both.

303
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,959
Both?

304
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,199
It's both original sin
and the original scene.

305
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,199
- Both?
- Both.

306
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,400
- It means both.
- Yes.

307
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,670
Let's talk about
the forbidden fruit first.

308
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,870
Min Seol A was wearing
a necklace when she died.

309
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,209
- Do you remember its pendant?
- An apple.

310
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,670
But it wasn't just an apple.

311
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,809
It was the forbidden fruit.

312
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,510
- That sounds far-fetched.
- No, it isn't.

313
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,510
It makes sense.

314
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,780
Do you remember
when that necklace first appeared?

315
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,819
It was during her interview
with Cheon Seo Jin.

316
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,290
Exactly. During her interview.

317
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:15,719
They sell this apple necklace
at that store.

318
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,089
Do you remember?

319
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,990
During the interview,

320
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,290
they showed a close-up
of the necklace.

321
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,959
And there must be a reason.

322
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,870
The necklace must hold a meaning.

323
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,969
The director must have
received an order.

324
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,870
There must have been an order.

325
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,010
"Please shoot an insert."

326
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,839
An insert.

327
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,010
We know...

328
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,780
- Every TV person knows that...
- Yes.

329
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,650
- if there's an insert...
- It's something important.

330
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,979
A close-up means
it's something really important.

331
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:43,520
It's extremely important.

332
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,780
But why is that the forbidden fruit?

333
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,319
What does
the forbidden fruit symbolize?

334
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,020
- Original sin.
- Original sin.

335
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,990
In addition,
it symbolizes temptation.

336
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,290
Temptation. That's right.

337
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,429
Yoon Hee resists temptation
many times,

338
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,530
but in the end, she gives in.

339
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,729
She ends up killing Min Seol A.

340
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:04,640
It was as if she picked
the forbidden fruit.

341
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,270
<font color="#ffff00">HER MURDER LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS
PICKING THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">AFTER PICKING
THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT...</font>

343
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,709
As long as you die,

344
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:16,250
Ro Na can be accepted.

345
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
<font color="#ffff00">YOON HEE COMMITS THE ORIGINAL SIN
THAT CAN'T BE WASHED AWAY.</font>

346
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:21,890
<font color="#ffff00">IS THE APPLE NECKLACE REALLY
THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT?</font>

347
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,920
Now that I think of it,

348
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,420
- the necklace was left in her hand.
- Yes.

349
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,959
It symbolizes her original sin
that can't be washed away.

350
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,160
- That's right.
- That was the intention.

351
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,299
Exactly.

352
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,559
Even if she gets cleared of
the accusation of killing Su Ryeon,

353
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,939
she still has to carry
her sin around all her life.

354
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,439
- That's incredible.
- Right?

355
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:40,069
If you look at it that way,
it sure is incredible.

356
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,969
I'd love to ask the writer about it.

357
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,280
- Right?
- Yes.

358
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,939
Were there any scenes...

359
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,380
that imply who the killer is?

360
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,579
Then let's look at a code...

361
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,250
- that already gave us the answer.
- Okay.

362
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,390
There were scenes that tell us
who killed Min Seol A.

363
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,819
It's the original scene.

364
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:59,459
Really? They tell us
who killed Min Seol A?

365
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:00,589
There were many of them.

366
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:03,630
I watched the show really carefully,
but I missed that.

367
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,099
- Did you watch Episode 3 carefully?
- Episode 3?

368
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:10,199
<font color="#ffff00">YOON HEE AND SEO JIN'S

370
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,740
Why don't you kill

371
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:17,740
who was accepted...

372
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,280
<font color="#ffff00">SEO JIN SUGGESTED YOON HEE'S

373
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,349
Obviously, you didn't pay
enough attention.

374
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:29,189
- Probably not.
- But there was a scene that was...

375
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,520
even more obvious.

376
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
What is it?

377
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,689
Do you remember Seol A's dog?

378
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:34,860
Sugar!

379
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,160

383
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,199
- The thing about Sugar is,
- Okay.

384
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,170
she never barks at anyone...

385
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,809
- Right.
- except for one person.

386
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:53,010
Who?

387
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,880
<font color="#ffff00">IT'S YOU.</font>

388
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,880
<font color="#ffff00">THE ONLY PERSON SUGAR BARKS AT.</font>

389
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,150
What's the matter?

390
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Stop it. That's enough.

391
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,660
<font color="#ffff00">SHE EVEN BITES YOON HEE.</font>

392
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:07,559
That's huge.

393
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,860
- Right?
- Just like the close-up.

394
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,729
In dramas,

395
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:14,229
animals usually play
an important role.

396
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:15,329
Right? They're important.

397
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:17,569
- Especially when they bark.
- It implies something.

398
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,540
Why didn't I remember that scene?

399
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,770
But the next scene
will shock you even more.

400
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,339
When are you going to stop
giving me the chills?

401
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,809
I'll continue until you get sick.

402

404
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,880

405
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,120
- Sorry.
- Do you want to work with me?

406
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,620
I apologize.

407
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,429
Many people say that this scene is
the best scene...

408
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:41,959
of The Penthouse Season One.

409
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,099
- Among all scenes...
- Oh, I know.

410
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,799
I agree with you.

411
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,199
Who is that?

412
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,299
- It's Cheon Seo Jin.
- Are you sure?

413
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,240
- That's how she plays.
- It doesn't look right.

414
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,939
<font color="#ffff00">LAUGHING</font>

415
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:05,380
<font color="#ffff00">THIS IS THE ACTUAL SCENE.</font>

416
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,689
It was raining,

417
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,660
and her father fell down the stairs.

418
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,490
She thought no one was watching.

419
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,199
- But there was.
- She gets blackmailed later.

420
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,469
But you can see that...

421
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:22,400
already in the scene
where her father dies.

422
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,499
Is that so?

423
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,469
Dad.

424
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,370
<font color="#ffff00">EUN BYEOL.</font>

425
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,410
<font color="#ffff00">EUN BYEOL.</font>

426
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:38,519
I was really curious
after I saw that scene.

427
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,820
That wasn't in my script.

428
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,920
I'm still really curious.

429
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,860
I want to ask him
if I get a chance to meet him.

430
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,189
<font color="#ffff00">MR. JUNG SUNG MO. IF YOU SEE THIS,
PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL.</font>

431
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:50,130
It was already revealed then.

432
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,199
He saw Eun Byeol filming everything.

433
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,229
Right. Her father saw her.

434
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,939
How can she hear him
if he calls her so softly?

435
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:59,600
But it would be weird if he shouted
out "Eun Byeol" at that moment.

436
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,009
Then Cheon Seo Jin wouldn't have
played the piano...

437
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:04,080
- and done something different.
- Then the scene wouldn't exist.

438
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,009
They show Eun Byeol
filming it later.

439
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:10,719
I see. There are a lot of
interesting elements...

440
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,620
- hidden in the scenes.
- There are.

441
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,420
I thought that...

442
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,519
I saw through everything as
I watched Season One,

443
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,360
- but there are many hidden scenes.
- This is fun.

444
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,429
The HePal's Code that I prepared...

445
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:24,560
is Contrapasso.

446
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,759
"Contrapasso"?

447
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,330
What is "contrapasso"?

448
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,699
It means that if you commit a sin,

449
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:31,370
your punishment
will correspond to it.

450
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,199
Then it's like
"An eye for a tooth"...

451
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,670
- Did I say "An eye for a tooth"?
- That's not right.

452
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,670
I'm sorry.

453
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,479
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Do you take a tooth for an eye?

454
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,310
No. That would hurt though.

455
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,279
- In any case...
- It's punitive justice.

456
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,920
- Punitive justice. Right.
- It means punitive justice.

457
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,949
You mentioned earlier that...

458
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,519
Dante's "The Divine Comedy"...

459
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,920
and Dante's breath is absorbed
into The Penthouse.

460
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,120
In "Inferno" which is a part of
Dante's "The Divine Comedy",

461
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,630
- "Inferno".
- the term "contrapasso" comes out.

462
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,660
<font color="#ffff00">CONTRAPASSO APPEARS IN DANTE'S
"THE DIVINE COMEDY" IN "INFERNO".</font>

463
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,330
It makes sense.

464
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,370
Yes. If I start talking about it,

465
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,070
you might end up slapping your knee.

466
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,469
- Okay. Let's see if I do.
- Don't let your pride stop you.

467
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,199
- No, I won't.
- If I'm right, do it.

468
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:07,269
- If you're right, I will.
- Okay.

469
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:08,969
We'll start with your favorite,

470
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:10,140
"An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth."

471
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,039
- Okay.
- I'll make it easy.

472
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,209
- "Fire, fire, fire, fire".
- "Fire, fire, fire, fire"?

473
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,910
Yes. "A fire for a fire,
and a fire for a fire."

474
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,820
In Episode 2 of Season 1,
do you remember the scene...

475
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,519
where Min Seol A gets bullied
by the kids in The Penthouse?

476
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,350
Yes, I do. They were so mean.

477
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,130
That fool.
I think something caught on fire.

478
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:34,070
<font color="#ffff00">IN THIS SCENE, THE CAR CAUGHT ON
FIRE WHEN SHE WAS LOCKED INSIDE.</font>

479
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,699
They were so mean,
and they started a fire.

480
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:38,699
Right. In the van.

481
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:41,709
There was a similar scene,
and I'm sure you remember it.

482
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:42,969
It's with the adults
in The Penthouse.

483
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,279
<font color="#ffff00">THE PARENTS

- I'm sorry!
- I apologize.

488
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,959
I was also wrong.

489
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,789
Are you going to slap your knee
or not?

00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,860
That isn't all.

493
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,759
- You slapped your knee too hard.
- Right. It really hurts.

494
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,800
But it was worth it.

495
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,929
The next is "Between affairs".

496
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:10,969
There are a lot of things
that in between.

497
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:13,239
When Cheon Seo Jin was trying to
steal Ha Yoon Chul away,

498
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:16,009
- Right.
- she had a drink with him.

499
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:18,410
- Through the window,
- Right. Yoon Hee sees them.

500
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:20,679
she sees Yoon Hee
and gives him a kiss.

501
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,179
Yoon Hee sees that happening.

502
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,179
There was such a scene,
and it repeats itself.

503
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,279
Where does it repeat?

504
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,479
Are you okay?

505
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,989
I shouldn't have called you
like this.

506
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,499
<font color="#ffff00">SHE FALLS INTO YOON CHUL'S ARMS
WHILE SEO JIN WATCHES.</font>

507
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,070
<font color="#ffff00">FURTHERMORE, SHE EVEN LOOKS
AT HER THROUGH THE WINDOW.</font>

508
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,670
Gosh.

509
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:52,080
- My knees will hurt so much later.
- It isn't over yet.

510
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,810
- There's more?
- Yes, it's "Between knees".

511
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,249
That's dangerous.

512
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,679
Is it okay to talk about
"Between the Knees"?

513
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,019
- It's not that.
- I enjoyed watching it.

514
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,219
It's not Rated R.

515
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:05,360
What I mean by this is
they get on their knees.

516
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,989
They get on their knees?
When do they do that?

517
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:08,660
First, it's because of
Yoon Hee's daughter, Ro Na.

518
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:10,330
Seo Jin.

519
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,759
<font color="#ffff00">YOON HEE GETS ON HER KNEES
IN FRONT OF HER NEMESIS, SEO JIN,</font>

520
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,870
<font color="#ffff00">FOR THE SAKE OF HER DAUGHTER.</font>

521
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,039
Are you asking me...

522
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,509
to use my connections
to let her in illegally?

523
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:23,439
If you want, I can even
clean your house. Seo Jin.

524
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,350
This repeats itself.

525
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:31,219
Cheon Seo Jin gets on her knees
in front of Shim Su Ryeon.

526
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:32,219
<font color="#ffff00">YOU'RE RIGHT.</font>

527
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:38,360
<font color="#ffff00">SEO JIN GETS ON HER KNEES IN FRONT

<font color="#ffff00">FOR THE SAKE OF HER DAUGHTER.</font>

529
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:43,999
Please save her.

530
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,769
<font color="#ffff00">THEY EVEN FILMED THE SCENES
IN THE SAME EXACT ANGLE.</font>

531
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:52,539
One.

532
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,439
<font color="#ffff00">THEY BEGIN TO SLAP THEIR KNEES
CONTINUOUSLY.</font>

533
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:55,870
Our knees will be so sore.

534
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,380
- It is incredible.
- Yes. It makes you slap your knee.

535
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,880
Contrapasso means punitive justice,

536
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,580
but it also means repetition.

537
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,050
It means repetition?

538
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,550
Were there scenes that
were repeated in The Penthouse?

539
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,689
There was quite a lot.
During the Cheong A Art Festival,

540
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:11,620
after the awards were given
and everything had ended,

541
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,429
Cheon Seo Jin and Oh Yoon Hee
have a fight in the dressing room.

542
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,989
Go on and try if you want.

543
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:22,269
<font color="#ffff00">AFTER THE CHUNG A ART FESTIVAL,
SEO JIN AND YOON HEE HAVE A FIGHT.</font>

544
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,310
That was the standard of
a dog fight.

545
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,380
- Right.
- Yes.

546
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,410
Do you remember the line
that was said then?

547
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,719
<font color="#ffff00">YOU'RE JUST A DARNED THIEF.</font>

548
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:43,759
You're just a darned thief.

549
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:44,989
<font color="#ffff00">SCARED</font>

550
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:49,929
Oh Yoon Hee said that
to Cheon Seo Jin, and later on...

551
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:51,060
<font color="#ffff00">THE SAME LINE IS REPEATED LATER
IN A CONTRAPASSO SCENE.</font>

552
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:53,769
- Ro Na says it to Eun Byeol.
- To Eun Byeol.

553
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,630
Go ahead and deny it if you can.

554
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,840
<font color="#ffff00">YOU'RE JUST A DARNED THIEF.</font>

555
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,179
You're just a darned thief.

556
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,550
<font color="#ffff00">IT'S FUN TO IMITATE IT.</font>

557
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,350
- It's repeated.
- Since we're talking about lines,

558
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,320
there's another line that
is repeated.

559
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,380
What is it?

560
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,920
<font color="#ffff00">SEOL A WAS POOR BUT DIGNIFIED.</font>

561
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,590
<font color="#ffff00">I PITY YOU GUYS.</font>

562
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,560
I pity you guys.

563
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,429
- Do you remember it?
- Yes, I do.

564
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:29,600
But... Why?

565
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,269
There's someone who says
the line that Min Seol A says.

566
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:34,570
- There is.
- It's Bae Ro Na.

567
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:40,650
<font color="#ffff00">RO NA IS THE TYPE TO SAY WHAT'S
ON HER MIND LIKE SEOL A.</font>

568
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,380
<font color="#ffff00">I PITY YOU GUYS.</font>

569
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,850
<font color="#ffff00">EVEN THE PEOPLE WHOM SHE SAYS IT TO
ARE THE SAME.</font>

570
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:49,019
While we were talking,

571
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:50,860
I realized that we could
talk about it all night.

572
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,360
- Right.
- I feel like we shouldn't...

573
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,259
let each scene pass us in vain.

574
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:58,729
If you keep in mind the codes
that we mentioned here today...

575
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,300
- as you watch Season Two,
- Right.

576
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,199
I think you will enjoy Season Two
a lot more.

577
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:05,400
That's nice.

578
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:07,670
<font color="#ffff00">JUST WAIT A BIT LONGER.</font>

579
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,769
I haven't...

580
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:10,170
<font color="#ffff00">I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN STARTED YET.</font>

583
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,350
Okay.
You have all waited a long time.

584
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,120
It's finally time for us to start
talking about...

585
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,749
- The Penthouse Season Two.
- Right.

586
00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:24,890
We asked a few questions
in advance...

587
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,120
through SBS Catch,

588
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,759
and a lot of people participated.

589
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,959
I heard.

590
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,699
We will start
The Penthouse Exploration...

591
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:34,729
- with our viewers right now.
- Okay.

592
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:36,630
Please give us the first question.

593
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,370

643
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,029
The first question is
more of a warm-up.

644
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:27,600
Nearly 300,000 people...

645
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,429
- answered this question.
- That's a lot.

646
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,199
Jung Sik, who do you think...

647
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:34,239
is the worst villain of Season One?

648
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,670
I'd say Lee Kyu Jin is.

649
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,239
He's not exactly a bad person,

650
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,410
- but he's sly.
- Exactly.

651
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,179
- It's not like he has ambitions...
- He's sly.

652
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,449
or goals.

653
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:44,080
Kyu Jin's goal in life is...

654
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,620
<font color="#ffff00">WHAT IS KYU JIN'S GOAL IN LIFE?</font>

655
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,949
It's to be the best son.

656
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:48,949
Isn't that awful?
To be the best son.

657
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,189
It's not to be a good son.

658
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,860
He's Wang Mi Ja's son.

659
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,330
Whatever happens,
he forgets the same day.

660
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,529
He doesn't remember things
longer than a minute.

661
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:57,060
A minute and a half at most.

662
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:00,259
I'm sure many people would...

663
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,999
- agree with my choice.
- Okay.

664
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:03,330
It's Joo Dan Tae.

665
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,300
He's not just a bad person.
He's evil.

666
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,739
He's evil.

667
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:10,939
- I can't wait to see the result.
- Right?

668
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:14,580
Let's see who our viewers think
is the worst villain.

669
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,709
Here we go.

670
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,880
Joo Dan Tae, by any standards.

671
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,249
I'd say Joo Dan Tae.

672
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:20,949
- Joo Dan Tae.
- Joo Dan Tae, right?

673
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:23,090
Joo Dan Tae won by far, didn't he?

674
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,920
Everyone knows that. It's no secret.

675
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,259
Right?

676
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,529
I guess it's me.

677
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:29,959
<font color="#ffff00">JOO DAN TAE WAS CHOSEN
AS THE WORST VILLAIN BY FAR.</font>

678
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,459
After Season Two, more than
80 percent would answer so.

679
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,429
That became clear
after yesterday's shooting.

680
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:36,670
<font color="#ffff00">WHAT TERRIBLE THINGS
DID HE DO NOW?</font>

681
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,570
I don't understand
why Oh Yoon Hee came in second.

682
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,610
It's not right.

683
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:42,870
It's unfair.

684
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,910
I guess it's because I killed
Min Seol A.

685
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,779
I actually committed murder.

686
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,850
I'll have to accept the result.

687
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:55,850
I expected that Cheon Seo Jin
would come in second.

688
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,949
Me?

689
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,890
I'm an awful person.

690
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:05,929
I deserve to be hated
and am unreasonably mean.

691
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,529
But from a legal perspective,
I didn't...

692
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,600
directly commit murder.

693
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,410
It's so weird that I'm saying this
while smiling.

694
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,070
Even though I'd love to beat
Oh Yoon Hee at everything...

695
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,140
<font color="#ffff00">SHE WANTS TO BEAT
OH YOON HEE AT EVERYTHING.</font>

696
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:21,080
This is such a disgrace,
so I'll give up.

697
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,150
Yoon Hee can have it.

698
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,179
What made the viewers
think this way?

699
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:28,590
- Let's find out.
- Great.

700
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,519
Here are comments from
those who chose Joo Dan Tae.

701
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,390
"One, Joo Dan Tae killed a person."

702
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,759
That's right.

703
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,259
- He did.
- It's clear.

704
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:38,130
"Two, he tries to solve everything
with money."

705
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:39,360
Gosh, that's right.

706
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
"Three, he hits children."

707
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,900
- Yes, he hits his children.
- He's such a jerk.

708
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,739
- He's trash.
- Going over all these things...

709
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:48,209
- There's a funny reason too.
- Okay.

710
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:49,539
"He has too many kissing scenes."

711
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:53,110
He makes me wonder,
"How can he kiss in that situation?"

712
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,749
He had many passionate
kissing scenes.

713
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,449
Let me read some of the comments...

714
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,279
from those who chose Oh Yoon Hee.

715
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,189
"Joo Dan Tae's evilness is
on another level,"

716
00:31:02,189 --> 00:31:04,019
"so it feels like he lives
in another world."

717
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:07,759
"Oh Yoon Hee is scarier
because people like her do exist."

718
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,330
- She feels more real.
- Do you agree?

719
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:13,360
"Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin
have always been mean."

720
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,800
"But Oh Yoon Hee pretended
to be nice in the beginning..."

721
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:19,469
"but then betrayed people
and turned into trash."

722
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,209
You get more hurt by betrayers...

723
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,769
- than those who've always been bad.
- You're right.

724
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:27,479
"The worst villain is the person
who started all this."

725
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:30,479
"The veterinarian".

726
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,679
- He ripped off Seol A.
- I know.

727
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,920
I got the money. Operate on her now.

728
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,560
It's 2,000 dollars, right?

729

730
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,300
That much?

731
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,699
Your dog might die
if you wait too long.

732
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,170
I'll get the money somehow.

734
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:55,739

- Exactly.

735
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,340
Seol In Ah wouldn't...

736
00:31:57,739 --> 00:31:58,979
- Seol...
- Seol In Ah?

737
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,910
- I mean Min Seol A.

<font color="#ffff00">LAUGHING</font>

741
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,989
- Seol A wouldn't have died.
- Min Seol A.

742
00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:09,320
She needed money.

743
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,489
This comment isn't funny.

744
00:32:11,489 --> 00:32:13,390
- It makes sense.
- It does.

745
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:15,090
Here comes the real fun part.

746
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:18,959
The Penthouse Season Two.
It's time to guess.

747
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,429
Let's get started.

The butterfly tattoo.

752
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,910
There's something suspicious
about that picture.

753
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,949
Their mother died right after
giving birth due to septicemia.

754
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,050

00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,870
- They seem very close.
- Right.

783
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,840
I'm so curious about her.

784
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,679

Don't worry.

788
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,659
- That photo too.

<font color="#ffff00">SHE WAS DESPERATE
TO STAY AT THE PENTHOUSE.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">THE PENTHOUSE EXPLORATION</font>

796
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,579

WHICH WILL BE REVEALED IN SEASON 2?</font>

798
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:56,849
This is the biggest mystery
of Season One.

799
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,720
- I agree.
- It has to be solved...

800
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,659
- in Season Two.
- It makes me uncomfortable.

801
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:04,059
Right? Joo Seok Hoon
and Joo Seok Kyung.

802
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,059
Who do you think is the woman...

803
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:08,470
with the butterfly tattoo
who gave birth to the twins?

804
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,800
I loved watching
one of Kim Soon Ok's previous works,

805
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,470
"Temptation of Wife".

806
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,639
In that show,

807
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,139
- Min So Hee comes back with a mole.
- Yes.

808
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:20,240
Just like that, I think
Shim Su Ryeon is the mother.

809
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,550
Her death was quite suspicious.

810
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,079
Everyone who has died
in The Penthouse so far...

811
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,889
- fell to their deaths.
- They fell to their deaths.

812
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:29,920
Including Min Seol A.

813
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,490
<font color="#ffff00">FALL</font>

814
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,559
- She fell to her death.
- She fell.

815
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,860
So did Cheon Seo Jin's father.

816
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,530
<font color="#ffff00">FALL</font>

817
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,769
Mr. Yoon is the same.

818
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:45,240
This is my final act of loyalty.

819
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,240
<font color="#ffff00">FALL</font>

820
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,970
- That's right.
- Mr. Yoon too.

821
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,139
But that's not true.

822
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,939
Director Min hung himself.

823
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,780
Oh, right.
Please ignore what I said.

824
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
<font color="#ffff00">SHE CHANGES HER POSITION
AS FAST AS LEE KYU JIN.</font>

825
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,720
- I like that about you.
- It wasn't 100 percent.

826
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,689
- You admit your mistakes.
- Of course.

827
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,220
You should take it back fast.

828
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,420
- What do you think?
- I suspect Ms. Yang.

829
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,720
Ms. Yang.

830
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,729
From editing herself
into the photo...

831
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:13,530
to her desperation
to stay at the Penthouse...

832
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,499
despite all the bad things
that happen to her,

833
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:17,829
everything makes her suspicious.

834
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,439
- You think she's their mother.
- Exactly.

835
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:22,840
- She's desperate to stay with them.
- Right.

836
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:24,309
That's why I suspect Ms. Yang.

837
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,079
- That makes sense.
- Right?

838
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:29,249
Let's find out
what the viewers think.

839
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,349
<font color="#ffff00">THE PENTHOUSE EXPLORATION</font>

840
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:35,019
<font color="#ffff00">SU RYEON'S TWIN SISTER, 61 PERCENT</font>

841
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:39,119
This time too,
more than half answered...

842
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,689
the woman would be
Su Ryeon's missing twin sister.

843
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:45,229
You're right. In Season One,

844
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,670
Logan Lee and Su Ryeon were
surprised by a picture.

845
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,729
Don't be surprised.

846
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,970
<font color="#ffff00">SURPRISED</font>

847
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:53,499
She was probably surprised because
the woman looks just like her.

848
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,039
That's right. Otherwise,

849
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,979
why would she be so surprised?

850
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:01,039
Let's see who came in second.

851
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:04,050
They agree with you.
They chose Ms. Yang.

852
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,579
The thing is,
in the photos that show up,

853
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:10,220
the shoulder...
Who always poses like that?

854
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,959
But from her hairstyle...

855
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,889
to her silhouette,
she looks a lot like Ms. Yang.

856
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:17,630
That's right.
The viewers chose her...

857
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,959
mostly because...

858
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:21,470
the woman in the photo has
a similar hairstyle to Ms. Yang's.

859
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,729
That's why, if you think about it,
the butterfly on her shoulder...

860
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:25,099
- means it's Ms. Yang.
- Yes.

861
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,070
It's only fair that
we tell the truth right about now.

862
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,809
- We know absolutely nothing.
- Right.

863
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:32,240
- But we heard something earlier.
- Yes.

864
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,079
The producer of this very show...

865
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,909
My gosh, seriously, you know...

866
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:37,749
- It was the biggest shock today.
- I know.

867
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,749
Our producer
already saw eight episodes.

868
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:41,289
Honestly, that's...

869
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:43,320
They're the one person
I envy the most right now.

870
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,789
Seriously. It feels like
the producer has everything I want.

871
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:47,059
They're loaded, like Mansour.

872
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,559
"Did you watch
the first eight episodes?"

873
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,630
So arrogantly, they said,

874
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,059
- "There were blanks in-between."
- "There were blanks."

875
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:53,329
They could've said "empty scenes",

876
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:55,229
- but they said "blanks".
- "There were blanks."

877
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,599
- Shall we ask just one thing?
- What?

878
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,340
Do you know who has
the butterfly tattoo?

879
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:00,289
- but they said "blanks".
- "There were blanks."

880
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:01,659
- Shall we ask just one thing?
- What?

881
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,400
Do you know who has
the butterfly tattoo?

882

WHAT IT WAS LIKE ON SET.</font>

884
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:10,740
In the photo taken at Seok Hoon
and Seok Kyung's first birthday,

885
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,599
that's when the tattoo
first appears.

886
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,139
When I posed for that photo...

887
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:17,380
was when I realized
someone else was the kids' mom.

888
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,840
The woman I posed with...

889
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,079
was an extra.

We're destined to watch the drama
at the same time as everyone else.

893
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,159
- Yes.
- That's our conclusion.

894
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,860
Some people named someone
who wasn't even an option.

895
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,590
Ma Doo Ki.

896
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,659
<font color="#ffff00">MA DOO KI?</font>

897
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,900
It's because
we brought up Ms. Yang's hair.

898
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,269
Ma Doo Ki's hairstyle...

899
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:45,240
- He has a bob cut too.
- He does.

900
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,769
And he does speak with
a feminine tone.

901
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:49,369
His gestures and things...

902
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,579
Considering Kim Soon Ok's style,

903
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,880
couldn't Ma Doo Ki
have been a woman?

904
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
<font color="#ffff00">MA DOO KI COULD'VE BEEN A WOMAN.</font>

908
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:02,949
Season One had an open ending.

909
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:04,519
I guess I could be a woman.

910
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:08,059
I promise to read
the future scripts carefully.

911
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,800
Ma Doo Ki appeared as
one of the possibilities.

912
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,460
It can't be that. I just laughed.

913
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,269
- That's nonsense.
- But Yoon Hee...

914
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,440
didn't know she was the killer.

915
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,599
I wish it were me.

916
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,010
I'm against it. I object.

917
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,469
- I see why.
- You two as a couple?

918
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:24,480

921
00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:30,050
not the woman but the man
with the butterfly tattoo?

922
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,179
We'll find out in Season Two.

923
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:33,789

924
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,749

- The Yoon-Yoon couple.

981
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:31,429
Like this?

<font color="#ffff00">A TYPICAL COOL LEAD</font>

991
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,990
It's a lot like "Boys Over Flowers".

992
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,289
Their characters...

1003
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:42,170
That's a lot of emotion
from Seok Hoon's perspective.

1004
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:43,539
Didn't you get it?

1005
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:44,639

- Shim Su Ryeon?
- Her again?

1023
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:30,650
- Only if he's mad.
- That's the movie "Ghost".

1024
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,920
"Love and War".

1025
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:33,590
It can't be them. She's dead.

- That is a possibility.
- It is.

1033

Wow, seeing separate footage
of them as couples...

1040
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,190
It feels different.

1041
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,599
The viewers love it so much...

1042
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,099
- that they even gave nicknames.
- I know.

1043
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,530
Dan-Seo couple.

1044
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,429
Su-Gan couple. Yoon-Yoon couple.

1045
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,740
And Seok-Ro couple.

1046
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,499
They support...

1047
00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:27,969
their favorite couple.

1048
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:31,139
Who's your favorite?

1049
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:32,880
- I like the Su-Gan couple.
- Oh, Su-Gan.

1050
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,909
Right. Those two are...

1051
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:38,320
They receive...

1052
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,719
the most attention in the drama.

1053
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:42,590
They also didn't express
their feelings...

1054
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,159
- in Season One.
- That's right.

1055
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,059
As you saw earlier, she tabbed him
in the chest with a pen.

1056
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:48,630
Let's say...

1057
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:51,300
- you're in love with someone.
- Okay.

1058
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,460
She stabbed you in your chest
with a pen.

1059
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,369
- Can you still love her?
- I'm going to sue her.

1060
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:56,400
Oh, right.

1061
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,900
Let's find out...

1062
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,240
- what the viewers think.
- Yes.

1063
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:09,079
<font color="#ffff00">THE PENTHOUSE EXPLORATION</font>

1064
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,949
As expected, many people support
Su Ryeon and Logan.

1065
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:16,019
- I was right.
- To return the favor,

1066
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:18,260
Su Ryeon must not die.

1067
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,289
- The writer needs to know this.
- I know.

1068
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:21,990
Su Ryeon should survive...

1069
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,900
- and fall in love with Logan.
- I hope so.

1070
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,030
- I'm saying it as a fan.
- As a fan.

1071
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,269
The next one is unexpected.

1072
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:30,940
Seok Hoon and Ro Na placed second.

1073
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,099
First place?

1074
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,139
What did I place?

1075
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:36,940
2nd? That's a shame.
I thought I placed 1st.

1076
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,780
What a shame.

1077
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,550
Thank you.

1078
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:43,920
I'm dying to find out too.

1079
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,980
<font color="#ffff00">WILL SEOK HOON AND RO NA WORK OUT?</font>

1080
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,719
I hope they work it out.

1081
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:49,090
I'm hoping they do.

1082
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,289
The biggest obstacle?

1083
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:52,389
The obstacle?

1084
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,559
- It's me. So what?
- We just had eye contact.

1085
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,730
My father is standing over there.

1086
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,699
I think it's my father.

1087
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:02,769
Seok Kyung? Maybe?

1088
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,999
It is true that Seok Kyung...

1089
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:07,610
hates Ro Na.

1090
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:12,079
And Seok Hoon cares so much
about Seok Kyung.

1091
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,110
I'm not saying I own my brother,

1092
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,920
but he keeps spending time...

1093
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,179
with the person I don't like.

1094
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:21,449
I'll set them apart.

1095
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:24,590
Everything upsets me.

1096
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,460
Also, quite a lot of people want...

1097
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,530
Seo Jin and Yoon Chul
to get back together.

1098
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:33,730
Maybe because they lived together...

1099
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:35,800
for 17 years?

1100
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,940
She wants to steal everything
of Yoon Hee.

1101
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,999
<font color="#ffff00">KIM SO YEON AS CHEON SEO JIN</font>

1102
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:40,909
But she also wants to take
Ha Yoon Chul away from her...

1103
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:44,010
because she still has feelings
left for him.

1104
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:45,510
At least that's what I thought
as I was acting.

1105
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,380
We call it love and hatred.

1106
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:49,749
I'm pretty sure...

1107
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:52,150
that's how they felt
when they fought.

1108
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,920
They also have Eun Byeol.

1109
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,389
I think that's why...

1110
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,460
people want them
to get back together.

1111
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,460
Not only the questions
and answers...

1112
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,969
but from the comments,

1113
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,570
I can tell that
we only have true fans with us.

1114
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:09,730
- You can feel their love.
- Right.

1115
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:11,269
Above all,

1116
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:14,340
we're going to find it out together.

1117
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,570
So I'm very excited.

1118
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:18,409
It will be fun to find out...

1119
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,909
- what we got right and wrong.
- Yes.

1120
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,679
People will be like, "See?"

1121
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,380
- "I was right."
- Yes.

1122
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,619
That's what people
are going to talk about.

1123
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:29,050
Now, it's the highlight...

1124
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,590
of The Penthouse 2 Special,
Hidden Room: A Secret Story.

1125
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:34,190
It's the generous preview
of Season Two.

1126
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:35,530
I can't believe we're doing this.

1127
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,159
First, we prepared how members
of Hera Palace are doing.

1128
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:39,260

00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:12,099
Of course.
You may look forward to it.

1136

Aside from being busy
with expanding my business,

1137

I'm having
the most peaceful time in life.

My relationship with Seo Jin is
going very smoothly too.

I'm going back to Seoul
on the first flight tomorrow.

1140
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:24,240
Okay. See you at home. Love you.

1141
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,639
I love you too, sweetie.

1142
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,679
He's very nice to me.

1143
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,650
People say I shine.

1144
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,190
I think it's the love I never
received before.

00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:46,800
Only good things have been
happening to me lately.

Oh, haven't you heard?

00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,240
Kyu Jin is now in politics.

1151
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,610
Not only the legal circle but
the political circle wants him too.

1154
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,820
I studied and stuff.

00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,199

Well... It's a long story.

00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:43,119
People think I've lost everything,

1162
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,889
but it has only begun.

Find everything that will choke him.

1168
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,300
What are you telling me that now?
You jerk.

1169
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:04,039
The more dangerous they are,
keep them close to you.

1170
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:06,510
- This is insane.
- A Gangnam Congressman's son.

1171
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,179
I'm thinking about placing
a pushover in the game.

1172
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:10,519
Then I'll never forgive you.

1173
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:12,280
So did you kill me?

1174
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,349
My goodness.

1175
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:15,490

Do all it takes to bring him
in front of me.

1179
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,400
You remember.

1180
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,460
Don't worry.

1181
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:38,010
Use the back door.

1182
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,280
You're lying?

1183
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,789
Admit it.

1184
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,219
You don't have to try so hard.

1185
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:55,090
Isn't it fun?

1186
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,590
I'll kill you.

1187
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,900
There will be fierce winds again.

Isn't that too much?

1194
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,849
As a viewer who's waiting
for The Penthouse 2,

1195
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:18,820
it was nice.

1196
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:20,820
Is it okay to reveal that much?

1197
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,119
I'm worried about our producer.

1198
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,719
He's the one who'll get fired.

1199
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,590
He looks like a good guy.

1200
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,329
- This might be our last time.
- I know.

1201
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:30,599
I feel bad for him.

1202
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,429
They revealed so much of it.

1203
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:35,969
I might as well reveal
something I know.

1204
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,400
- I picked up something huge.
- Do you know something?

1205
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,869
I watched
the producer editing earlier.

1206
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:43,070
I could see it.

1207
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:47,079
In Season Two, the producer changes.

1208
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:49,449
- In Season One, the producer was...
- It was Joo Dan Tae.

1209
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:51,179
- But in Season Two...
- Who is it?

1210
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:54,050
<font color="#ffff00">WHAT DID HE SEE?</font>

1211
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,449
- I also have a secret card.
- Really?

1212
00:52:56,449 --> 00:52:59,659
But it's... I'm not sure
if it's okay to say it.

1213
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:02,460
Are you sure we're doing
what's best for the drama?

1214
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,030
I don't know. I don't know
what will happen to us either.

1215
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,030
- I acquired it.
- What did you acquire?

1216
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,429
The script.

1217
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,570
- Come on.
- Not Comedy Big League's script.

1218
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,340
- No way.
- Don't be surprised.

1219
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:15,670
- Does your chair have back support?
- No.

1220
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:18,240
Stand tight. You'll fall back.

Hey.

1224
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,079
- Are you okay?
- I'm doing my best.

1225
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,550
I'm learning a lot from you.

1226
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,550
I'm SBS' representative anchor.

1227
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,019
These are the scripts
for The Penthouse.

1228
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,659
- They're real.
- For Seasons 1 and 2. They're real.

1229
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:36,929
It's not just the cover. It's real.

1230
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:39,199
- I think it says Jang Do Yeon.
- No.

1231
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,969
It's real.

1232
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:48,510
The viewers are going to hate us.

1233
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:51,010
This is real. It's a real script.

1234
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:54,710
There's slapping.

1235
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:57,010
My goodness. There's splashing.

1236
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,619
Autopsy.

1237
00:53:58,619 --> 00:53:59,820
- Autopsy.
- Wait. What's this?

1238
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,889
Fritters and tteokbokki?
What's this?

1239
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:03,349
Why does it say
fritters and tteokbokki?

1240
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:05,260
If we keep going,

1241
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,960
- people will hate us.
- I agree.

1242
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:09,389
We should do something.

1243
00:54:09,389 --> 00:54:13,360
Why don't we reveal a bit...

1244
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,699
that it wouldn't spoil the drama?

1245
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:17,170
Where shall we start?

1246
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,499
- Episode 1.
- Episode 1?

1247
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:21,610
I feel like an actress
to read the script.

1248
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,039
Let's pick a random scene.

1249
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:24,840
Like Scene 43
or something like that.

1250
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,510
Sound good. Scene 43.

1251
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,749
It's Scene 43.

1252
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:30,510
We'll read just what it says...

1253
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,249
without changing a word of it.

1254
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,920
- Episode 1, Scene 43.
- We aren't good at acting.

1255
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,420
Even if we do it,
people wouldn't know.

1256
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,119
- I'll start.
- Read it. Read the text too.

That was...

1263
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,840
I'm sorry, writer.

1264
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,809
We could do the whole episode
if we do it like this.

1265
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:03,079
Even if we keep going,

1266
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:04,849
it wouldn't affect the drama.

1267
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:08,219
- That was Episode 1, Scene 43.
- Now, Episode 2.

1268
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:10,389
You must check Scene 43
in Episode 1. It's there.

1269
00:55:10,389 --> 00:55:11,559
I wonder how it will look.

1270
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,619

- Scene Four.

1271

- Scene Four.
- Yes.

1272

1283
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:38,619
I think...

1284
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:40,519
- people wouldn't notice.
- We can do the whole episode.

1285

Let's move on.

1292
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:59,099
Do as I say. It's not impossible.

1293
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:02,170
It was just never brought
to the surface.

1294
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,710
Okay, that was like...

1295
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,039
"I'm Jessie. I'm James. I'm Meowth."

1296
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:08,280
It...

1297
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,949
- It keeps going.
- Just like in "Pokemon".

I'm sure there are people who want
to watch our spoiler.

Are there?

00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,900
That doesn't matter.

1307
00:56:31,869 --> 00:56:33,400
Why did you act old?

1308
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,610
In case I spoil it.

1309
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:37,369
We just read the script.

1310
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:39,880
I bet some people feel refreshed.

1311
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,610
You think?
What if it was frustrating?

1312
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:43,280
Like eating sweet potatoes.

1313
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,179
- You think?
- Now that we've done it,

1314
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:48,119
you should watch how the actors...

1315
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:50,119
- actually deliver those lines.
- I don't ask for anything else,

1316
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:52,219
but can you compare our rendition
with the drama after Season Two?

1317
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:54,059
- Right.
- I'd like to see it.

1318
00:56:54,059 --> 00:56:56,130
Let's be humiliated big time.

1319
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,099
After reading the script,

1320
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,900
I want to see the actors...

1321
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,869
bring these lines to life.

1322
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:04,170
- Do you want to see it?
- Is there more?

1323
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,340
Of course.

1324
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,409
We have a producer
who only lives today.

1325
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:11,039
Let's say goodbye to the producer
before we go.

1326
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:12,179
This time,

1327
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,050
let's watch The Penthouse 2
by theme.

1328
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,150
<font color="#ffff00">THE PENTHOUSE 2 PREVIEW BY THEME</font>

1329
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:26,090
<font color="#ffff00">THEME 1, DIFFERENT THOUGHTS
IN ONE SCENE</font>

1330
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,130
<font color="#ffff00">FROM SEASON 1, EPISODE 21</font>

1331
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,760
What's important is that we got rid
of the thorns on our sides.

1332
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,469
<font color="#ffff00">THEY GOT RID OF ALL OBSTACLES.</font>

1333
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,010
Bye, bye.

1334
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,749
<font color="#ffff00">WILL THERE BE A NEW FAMILY?</font>

1335
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:54,719
<font color="#ffff00">DAN TAE'S FAMILY AND SEO JIN'S
FAMILY ARE HAVING DINNER TOGETHER.</font>

1336
00:57:54,849 --> 00:58:00,760
<font color="#ffff00">HOW DO THEY FEEL TO BE
IN ONE PLACE TOGETHER?</font>

1337
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,190
Something I have to get.

1338
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,159
It's not love.
It's a certain something.

1339
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:07,570
Why can't we be well together?

1340
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,969
If Seok Kyung becomes family,

1341
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:13,170
I... No, I don't have to pretend
that we're close.

1342
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:14,969
We don't have to be close.

1343
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:18,780
But once Seok Hoon becomes family,

1344
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,210
our love can't be achieved.

1345
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:24,349
I must avoid it
by all means necessary.

1346
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:26,179
Do you want to say anything?

1347
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:28,449
No.

1348
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:31,090
There is a possibility...

1349
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,429
that Eun Byeol's family
and my family would unite.

1350
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:37,829
Since I can't ignore it,

1351
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:42,400
it will become a big obstacle
between me and Ro Na.

1352
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,499
If you excuse me.

1353
00:58:45,499 --> 00:58:47,769
Sit down.
The adults are still eating.

1354
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:50,510
I'd be upset.

1355
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:52,809
Oh, I mean, Seok Kyung.

1356
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,710
The situation itself is
already upsetting.

1357
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,719
And on top of that,
she'll have to live with...

1358
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,550
that annoying Ha Eun Byeol.

1359
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:05,019
Then she'd explode
and break everything.

1360
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:07,990
Mom. His lemon charlotte was
really good.

1361
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:09,860
Did you like it?

1362
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,499
<font color="#ffff00">WILL THEY BE ABLE TO UNITE?</font>

1363
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:18,269
<font color="#ffff00">THEME 2, OBSERVATION POINTS
OF SEASON 2 FROM THE ACTORS</font>

1364
00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:19,599
One word?

1365
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,469
Chaos?

1366
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,639
<font color="#ffff00">THE CHAOTIC STORY OF SEASON 2</font>

1367
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:27,710
<font color="#ffff00">WHAT COULD IT BE?</font>

1368
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:29,949
I'd say "hashtag regret".

1369
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,150
<font color="#ffff00">REGRET</font>

1370
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,420
<font color="#ffff00">TEARS OF REGRET?</font>

1371
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,219
I think it's change.

1372
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:37,760
<font color="#ffff00">CHANGE IN PERSON?
CHANGE IN RELATIONSHIPS?</font>

1373
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:41,190
It's the matter of
Ma Doo Ki's appearance.

1374
00:59:41,389 --> 00:59:45,329
<font color="#ffff00">HIS APPEARANCE ALONE
MAKES IT FUNNY.</font>

1375
00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:46,699
Jenny changes.

1376
00:59:46,929 --> 00:59:48,699
She's no longer the Jenny
you knew from Season One.

1377
00:59:48,969 --> 00:59:52,340
<font color="#ffff00">IT'S FRUSTRATING TO WAIT
AND FIND OUT.</font>

1378
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,369
She rebels in a different way.

1379
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:58,880
<font color="#ffff00">ARE YOU SURPRISED
BY THE NEW WAY OF REBELLION?</font>

1380
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,050
All relationships change.

1381
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,920
<font color="#ffff00">WHY DO THE RELATIONSHIPS CHANGE?</font>

1382
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,820
<font color="#ffff00">I'M NOT TELLING YOU.</font>

1383
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,249
I realized the power of family
is great.

1384
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:12,389
<font color="#ffff00">ASKING MOM FOR HELP</font>

1385
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,690
A series of twists.

1386
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:19,130
<font color="#ffff00">A TWIST IS COMING SOON</font>

1387
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,969
I don't know what to focus on.

1388
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,840
<font color="#ffff00">WHAT SHOULD WE FOCUS ON?</font>

1389
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,170
Twist after twist after twist.

1390
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:33,179
<font color="#ffff00">THE EFFECT OF THE TWISTS
IS CLEAR.</font>

1391
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:36,380
It's a big twist.
It won't be on TV anyway.

1392
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,949
<font color="#ffff00">SECRET STORY</font>

1393
01:00:37,949 --> 01:00:39,019

1394
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:42,749
<font color="#ffff00">IT'S A HUGE TWIST.</font>

1395
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:46,519
I didn't expect it either.

1396
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:47,789
What a twist. Don't you agree?

1397
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:51,030
I think it's the biggest twist
in Season Two.

1398
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,130
What do you think is going on?

1399
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:55,969
<font color="#ffff00">THERE ARE BETRAYAL,</font>

1403
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,409
The Penthouse 2.

1404
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:08,210
We've seen a lot,

1405
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,480
- but I don't know what I saw.
- I know.

1406
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,519
- I'm getting even more curious.
- That's right.

1407
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:15,889
Even though I've seen a lot,
I'm still curious.

1408
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:18,219
I guess...

1409
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:20,059
the quantity doesn't matter.

1410
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:22,090
So when is Season Two starting?

1411
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:23,590
You must not miss it.

1412
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:27,130
It premieres on Friday,
February 19 at 10 p.m.

1413
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,469
Don't miss The Penthouse 2.

1414
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:33,099
We'll now leave discreetly.

1415
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:34,139
Sounds good.

1416
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:35,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1417
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:42,510
Hello, viewers of The Penthouse.

1418
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,619
Did you enjoy watching Season One?

1419
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:47,019
Season One received so much love.

1420
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:48,420
The Penthouse 2...

1421
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,019
Will premiere on February 19.

1422
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:53,760
We're surprised...

1423
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,530
to read the script every time.

1424
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:56,929
We'll come back with a brutal...

1425
01:01:56,929 --> 01:01:58,530
Even more spectacular...

1426
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,800
And shocking story.

1427
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,530
Please continue to support us.

1428
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:04,740
As much as you waited...

1429
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,369
We worked hard to shoot the show.

1430
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:09,139
We're doing great.

1431
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:10,409
Please look forward to it.

1432
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:12,579

If you don't watch...

1434
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:14,949
You'll be punished.

1435
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:17,550
That was weird.
