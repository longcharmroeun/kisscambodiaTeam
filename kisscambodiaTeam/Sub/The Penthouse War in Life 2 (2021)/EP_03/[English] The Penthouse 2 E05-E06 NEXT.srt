1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,779
(Episode 3)

2
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,429
I don't believe this.
That was a perfect high F.

3
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,655
What happened? You didn't say
you'd raise it to a high F.

4
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,095
It's hard enough to hit it
after a break.

5
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,419
It's nearly impossible to hit it
in one breath.

6
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,990
Did you intentionally hold back
what you could do?

7
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:08,259
You.

8
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,300
Who are you?

9
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,239
Who are you?

10
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,139
How...

11
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,549
How are you...

12
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,750
Finally, I get to say hi.

13
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,160
I hope we get along
from now on, Seo Jin.

14
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:44,060
How...

15
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,329
did you get in here?

16
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,076
Shouldn't you thank me?

17
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,539
How can you sing?

18
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,569
Your vocal cords were ruined.

19
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,479
Yes, thanks to you.

20
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,826
I guess it's a miracle.

21
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,356
I got the surgery done,

22
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,750
and I'm completely recovered.

23
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,160
My throat that you stabbed
with your trophy...

24
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,400
saved you from embarrassment today.

25
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,976
Isn't life so funny?

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,169
You...

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,310
really sang that?

28
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,340
No way.

29
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,250
I certainly talked
to Park Young Ran.

30
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,220
The number you have dialed is
not registered.

31
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,365
Please check the number again.

32
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,430
Why?

33
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,930
Are you flustered because the number
doesn't exist?

34
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,970
(Park Young Ran)

35
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,269
Did you set this up?

36
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,509
Did you set it up to fool me?

37
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,615
How could you? Did you stalk me?

38
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,180
How did you find out
that my voice was having issues?

39
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,156
Take your things and get out
right now.

40
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,289
I don't care whether you two
got married for real or not.

41
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,936
- But you can't live here.
- Why not?

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,636
Your daughter, Eun Byeol,
lives here.

43
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,905
Don't you care if she gets hurt?

44
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,076
Do you call yourself her dad?

45
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
(Installed)

46
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,439
Why are you so scared?

47
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,970
No one who made a debut.

48
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,915
Find an amateur.

49
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,340
She can't be too young or too old.
She has to be around my age.

50
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:42,080
We don't have time. We have a week.

51
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,220
This concert must be perfect...

52
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,650
no matter what.

53
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,196
What do you want?

54
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,465
There must be a reason why
you're doing all of this!

55
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:58,705
I'm just getting back everything...

56
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,929
that you took away from me.

57
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,806
You remember, right?

58
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,570
The best voice and Yoon Chul
were both mine...

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,309
initially.

60
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,539
What did you just say?

61
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:14,439
Who would've thought that you'd
look for someone to lip-sync to?

62
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,479
Life is full of surprises,
don't you think?

63
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,320
Cheon Seo Jin, the fake soprano.

64
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,100
She's right there!

65
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,006
Congratulations on making
new history in Korea's music scene!

66
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,015
Tell us how you feel about the best
performance you just had.

67
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,140
You've proven yourself to everyone
despite the retirement rumors.

68
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,415
You must've felt so pressured
as a soprano.

69
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,816
How did you overcome that?

70
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,415
What's the secret
to your perfect voice?

71
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,109
You're the biggest star.
Please say a word.

72
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:53,619
Seo Jin, that was
an amazing performance today.

73
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:54,950
Congratulations.

74
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:58,890
This is just the beginning.
Just you wait.

75
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,129
I'm going to get my place back.

76
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,770
Thank you.

77
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,215
I'd like to be interviewed
officially tomorrow.

78
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,845
I need some rest.

79
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:16,246
Secretary Do, please schedule
the interviews...

80
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,215
at their best convenience.

81
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:20,415
- Please!
- Just one thing.

82
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,056
- Please say a word.
- Please get out.

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,455
- Ms. Cheon!
- Please!

84
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:26,379
See you tomorrow.

85
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,999
That was so amazing.

86
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:47,539
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

87
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,010
Let's go.

88
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,850
How have you been?

89
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,090
I know I have no right to say this,

90
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,260
but I miss you so much.

91
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Sorry.

92
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,739
Give me a little time.

93
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,280
I'll uncover the truth
behind what happened that day...

94
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,520
even if it kills me.

95
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,450
And...

96
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,119
I'll pay for my sins too. I promise.

97
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,475
Here's to the 20th anniversary...

98
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:51,600
of the beautiful prima donna
Cheon Seo Jin's debut.

99
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,840
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

100
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Congratulations.

101
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,725
I totally got goosebumps.

102
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,355
How could a human being
make such a sound?

103
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,749
The reviews praising you
are pouring in.

104
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,629
You really are the one and only
treasure of our country.

105
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,535
Is there anything that you lack?

106
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:21,306
You come from a good family.
You're the best in your field.

107
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,746
Your ex-husband is a doctor.

108
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,705
Your current boyfriend is
a successful businessman.

109
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,546
You got everything.
Life is so unfair.

110
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,486
Chairman Joo is the one
who has it good.

111
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,085
His business is thriving.

112
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:34,756
His future wife is successful.

113
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,510
He's besties with Kyu Jin.

114
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,420
He wouldn't change places
even with the president of Korea.

115
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,666
Thank you for celebrating with us.

116
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,526
Let's drink until late.

117
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,690
It's all on me.

118
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,889
Yes!

119
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,159
Your voice sounded very different
from usual.

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,475
You raised the final note
to a high F, didn't you?

121
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:58,975
Right?

122
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,615
I thought it was
a different person too.

123
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,255
What's your secret?
I want to share it with Jenny.

124
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,516
Yes, how did you do it?

125
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,649
Did you pick up a new skill?

126
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,680
There's nothing like that.

127
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:18,666
That's right. I saw Oh Yoon Hee
at the concert tonight.

128
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,196
I wonder if Dr. Ha was with her.

129
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,335
That couple keeps
elbowing their way in...

130
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,200
where they're not invited.

131
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,076
Oh Yoon Hee was there?

132
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,105
When? I didn't see her.

133
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,739
Let's stop talking about
useless things, and drink.

134
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm sure she wanted to ruin
a nice day.

135
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,046
She always considered Seo Jin
a rival all her life...

136
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,885
and survived on
her inferiority complex.

137
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,416
She must've been jealous...

138
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,186
when she heard
about her solo concert...

139
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,979
Yoon Hee wasn't there!

140
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,060
My apologies.

141
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,999
I don't feel too well.

142
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,430
Please excuse me.

143
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,700
But... Ms. Cheon...

144
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,170
What the...

145
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:11,540
What's wrong with her?

146
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,249
Let's reschedule the celebration.

147
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,920
Why is she being like that
on this happy occasion?

148
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,166
Something did happen.

149
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,865
I bet Oh Yoon Hee...

150
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,105
That goes without saying.

151
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,806
She's been irritable
ever since she moved in.

152
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,475
She's such a brat.

153
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,605
That's why Dr. Ha switched over
to Oh Yoon Hee.

154
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,806
We'll have to watch
what we say for the time being.

155
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,769
I'm afraid it'll end up
hurting the kids.

156
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,369
Her and her nasty temper.

157
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,909
Poor Chairman Joo. Poor guy.

158
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:47,585
Why is he marrying someone like her?

159
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:49,156
It's better to grow old alone.

160
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,409
He is affection-deprived.

161
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:08,470
Fake soprano Cheon Seo Jin.

162
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,519
Stop! Stop!

163
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,290
You need to project!

164
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,159
Don't you know how important
this audition is?

165
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,190
It's an opportunity to sing with
the best opera company in Italy.

166
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,406
They only wanted to see Yoon Hee,
the top student in the school,

167
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,070
but I forced your way in.

168
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,205
I'll practice more, Father.

169
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:45,646
I can do it.

170
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,340
I know I can pass the audition.

171
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Are you weeping
because I nagged a little?

172
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,710
You know I can't stand
seeing chicks cry.

173
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,879
Do it again!

174
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,989
How did it go?

175
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:11,960
Who made it, Yoon Hee or me?

176
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:14,430
Loser.

177
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,499
You can't beat her even once?

178
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,269
Then...

179
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,269
is Yoon Hee going to Italy?

180
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:23,869
I can't allow that.

181
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,909
We arranged it to say
Yoon Hee turned them down.

182
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,509
After what I did to get you in,
you almost lost it.

183
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:32,920
What a disgrace.

184
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:34,550
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,190
Let's go.

186
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,100
What's Eun Byeol doing?

187
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:23,470
She just fell asleep
after finishing her assignment.

188
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:25,300
Good work.

189
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,239
You should rest too.

190
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,180
Eun Byeol.

191
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,379
Finally, I can breathe.

192
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,855
My mom's engagement...

193
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,495
and my dad's return
after getting remarried...

194
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,090
were all annoying me
and driving me crazy.

195
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,489
Thanks for coming with me,
Seok Hoon.

196
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,100
Just hang on a few more months.

197
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:28,600
During your mom
and my dad's wedding,

198
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,800
we'll drop our bombs
and each go our separate ways.

199
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,109
No one can find out before then.

200
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,090
You promised you wouldn't do this.

201
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,605
Can it really not be me?

202
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,090
Aren't you sick of asking me that?

203
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,560
I told you
I'm not interested in you.

204
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,605
We have the same goal, that's all.

205
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,215
Ruining the wedding.
Never becoming family.

206
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,499
You can't end up with Ro Na anyway.

207
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:14,156
You can use me to get over Ro Na.
So...

208
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,509
Eun Byeol. I told you
not to say Ro Na's name.

209
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:24,190
It's late. Let's go.

210
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:29,960
Wait for me.

211
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:35,029
Thanks for taking me out.

212
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,330
Get home safely.

213
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
Sweet dreams.

214
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,840
Where did you go?

215
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,379
To the studio.

216
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:50,050
I couldn't study,
so I went to practice instead.

217
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,609
What are you doing?

218
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,519
I went swimming.

219
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,420
You're the top student.
Why are you trying so hard?

220
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,619
Later.

221
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,060
She didn't hear me, did she?

222
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,369
Eun Byeol. So you're lying now.

223
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,310
Who's your boyfriend
that you were out this late?

224
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,085
Dr. Ha has been attending
business meetings...

225
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,820
or spending time with Oh Yoon Hee.

226
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,119
There hasn't been anything unusual.

227
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,590
What about her daughter?

228
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,826
I haven't seen her yet.

229
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,989
She hasn't seen her daughter.

230
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,430
Was Oh Yoon Hee at the concert?

231
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,769
Yes. She was in the dressing room
with Ms. Cheon.

232
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,300
She was with her.

233
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,215
I saw Oh Yoon Hee
at the concert tonight.

234
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,239
Yoon Hee wasn't there!

235
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,649
Put a tail on Cheon Seo Jin too.

236
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,509
Report anything suspicious.

237
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,190
Cheon Seo Jin and Oh Yoon Hee.

238
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,690
I'm sure there's something
going on between the two.

239
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,746
I'm sorry, ma'am.

240
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,869
Is that it? "I'm sorry"?

241
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,585
Where did it go wrong?

242
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,480
How did Park Young Ran
turn into Oh Yoon Hee?

243
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:30,280
Who is the woman I met?

244
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:32,280
The broker has disappeared.

245
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:34,580
I have nothing to say.

246
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:47,060
What is Oh Yoon Hee thinking?

247
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,500
How much does she know?

248
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,226
What are you making?

249
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,020
You startled me.

250
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:15,090
This is against our contract.

251
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,959
- Go have a seat.
- Okay.

252
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:22,869
You didn't have to prepare so much.

253
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,969
This is enough for breakfast.

254
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,340
I just prepared what I want.

255
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,280
What are you doing today?

256
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,080
You're not allowed to ask
questions like that, remember?

257
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,879
I'm pretty busy.

258
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,425
That looks good. Can I try?

259
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:42,966
No. It's mine.

260
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,335
You're so petty. Let me try.

261
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,189
- No.
- Let me just try a little.

262
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,159
Okay, just a little.

263
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,600
Here.

264
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,169
This is so good.

265
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,139
(Cheong A Arts High School)

266
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,609
Is Seok Hoon seeing a girl?

267
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,026
- What?
- He came back very late...

268
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,480
on his motorbike last night.

269
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:16,990
And he had two helmets.

270
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,790
- Could it be Bae Ro Na?
- Bae Ro Na?

271
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,066
Does that make sense to you?

272
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,129
He was crazy for her.

273
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,375
Now that her mom has been acquitted,

274
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,976
what's stopping him?

275
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,375
He never liked her.
He was just fooling around.

276
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:36,040
If Bae Ro Na comes back
and bothers my brother again,

277
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,840
I won't sit back.

278
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,810
That's not going to happen.

279
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,855
She's not in Korea. Her mom said so.

280
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:48,195
She's still in the US.

281
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,520
Are you sure? She's not back yet?

282
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,590
Yes, I'm sure.

283
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,230
Thanks for the useful information.

284
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,236
You sure know everything
about your best friend.

285
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,335
That's not it.
I just happened to hear...

286
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,746
Don't come to our study group
meeting later.

287
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,969
A turncoat like you creeps me out.

288
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,415
Give me my backpack.

289
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,885
People will think
I made you carry it.

290
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,810
Stop pretending to be nice.

291
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,959
Thank you. I appreciate it.

292
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,335
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

293
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,935
- I loved your concert.
- Can we take a picture together?

294
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:33,159
Of course. Here you go.

295
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,776
Here you go. Thank you.

296
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,629
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

297
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,199
Hello, what's your name?

298
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,609
It's Oh Yoon Hee.

299
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,010
What are you doing here?

300
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,750
I want your autograph too.

301
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,230
(Oh...)

302
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,639
This is for you.

303
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:18,139
Open it.

304
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:27,820
(Non-Disclosure Agreement)

305
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,826
(Non-Disclosure Agreement)

306
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,359
(Cheon Seo Jin, Park Young Ran)

307
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,859
It seems like you've forgotten
our agreement.

308
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,300
Don't worry. I'll keep my word.

309
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:53,240
Thanks for your autograph.
I'll treasure it.

310
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:03,365
You're being more and more
recognized overseas as well.

311
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,796
Are you planning on any tours?

312
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,695
I feel like I still have a lot
to do in this country.

313
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:09,335
I'm going to take my time
and think about it.

314
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,266
Many people are complimenting
that you sang...

315
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,206
your first piece in perfect pitch
like an instrument.

316
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,605
When will the live album
be released?

317
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:18,199
I can't wait to listen to it.

318
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:21,699
Well...

319
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,385
Can't you sing it for us now?

320
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,280
"Una Voce Poco Fa".

321
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:31,026
That piece was absolutely beautiful.

322
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,996
Can we hear it?

323
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,796
Please sing for us.

324
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,919
- Please.
- We'd love to hear it.

325
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,459
Please.

326
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm sorry. I haven't fully recovered
my voice yet.

327
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,986
I can't let Oh Yoon Hee
keep pushing me around.

328
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,155
Find something on her.

329
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,165
Search her house,
put a tail on her, or whatever.

330
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,889
I want something that can
back her into a corner.

331
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,159
Why don't you postpone
the alumni reunion tonight?

332
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:24,429
You don't seem so well.

333
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:30,469
It was going to be my treat to thank
them for coming to my concert.

334
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,619
Hi, it's me.

335
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,350
I'm so sorry.

336
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,389
I can't make it tonight
because I'm not feeling well.

337
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,330
I'll talk to the chef
so you can dine without me.

338
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,600
What are you talking about?

339
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:05,840
Why would she show up there?

340
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,526
We'll let you know as soon
as the new product is released.

341
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,850
Chairman Joo.

342
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,826
You may leave.

343
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,796
Hello, I'm assemblyman
Lee Kyu Jin of Gangnam.

344
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,020
I'm assemblyman
Lee Kyu Jin of Gangnam.

345
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,859
Considering their reaction,
I guess they don't live in Gangnam.

346
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:30,046
Anyway, with your
furniture business taking off,

347
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,706
you seem very busy.

348
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,776
I was just about to leave.
What brings you here?

349
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,270
Gosh, that chair looks amazing.

350
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:44,026
I was nearby and thought
I should stop by.

351
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,585
Partly that,

352
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,480
and my fingers were getting itchy.

353
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,619
Aren't you tired of playing
with me alone?

354
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,490
Also, I win your money
all the time anyway.

355
00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:57,290
I feel bad.

356
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,629
That's why I'm thinking of
bringing in a pushover today.

357
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,139
Do you know anyone?

358
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:16,925
Thanks for letting me join.

359
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,520
We haven't done this in a while.

360
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:23,119
Now it feels real
that I'm back in Hera Club.

361
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,760
By the way, you brought
a beautiful lady with you.

362
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:31,665
Oh, I ran into her
when I just left home,

363
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:32,935
and she wanted to tag along.

364
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:36,330
To make sure the game is fair,
I'll be your dealer today.

365
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,939
Is it okay if we raise the stakes?
No limit.

366
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,270
- Sure.
- Of course.

367
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,350
Dr. Ha.

368
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,719
Ten more.

369
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,405
Mr. Lee, are you taking
all my money away?

370
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,806
If you're scared, quit.

371
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,230
- Call.
- Call.

372
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,770
Oh, my.

373
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:18,169
- Gosh.
- What's wrong?

374
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,480
I'm out.

375
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,850
- Do you want to continue?
- Why not?

376
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,480
Dr. Ha, you've become quite bold
since you started your business.

377
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,050
This is the first round,
and I admire your spirit,

378
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,520
but too bad.

379
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:33,520
Flush.

380
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,459
Sorry, I win.

381
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,639
My cards are better.

382
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,050
- That was amazing.
- You're right.

383
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,355
- It's delicious.
- Look at you!

384
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:04,496
- I thought you couldn't make it.
- Welcome.

385
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,395
I was sad because I thought
we wouldn't be able to see you.

386
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:07,560
Did you catch a cold?

387
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,359
I guess I overworked myself.

388
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,929
I feel better now that I've taken
some medicine.

389
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,260
The seat is taken.

390
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,830
By who?

391
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,969
Hey.

392
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,540
You're late.

393
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,040
I can join you guys, right?

394
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:28,016
I know I wasn't invited,

395
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,685
but I wanted to come
to congratulate you.

396
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:30,949
This is...

397
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,980
the Seoul University of Music
alumni reunion.

398
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,996
Isn't it a little uncomfortable
for you?

399
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,919
Come on. Don't say that.

400
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,195
Yoon Hee is also a Cheong A
Arts High School alumni.

401
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:43,659
Apparently, she went to watch
your performance last night too.

402
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,135
She deserves to be here, no?

403
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,576
- Of course.
- Have a seat.

404
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,100
- Nice of you to join us.
- Come here.

405
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:53,669
- Cheers.
- All right.

406
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,216
I was surprised by Seo Jin's singing
last night.

407
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,716
It was the best.

408
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,655
Yoon Hee was better in school.

409
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,986
You remember
the Cheong A Art Festival, right?

410
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,155
I got goosebumps...

411
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:06,980
because I was reminded
of Yoon Hee last night.

412
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,796
You too?

413
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,365
When Seo Jin hit the high F,

414
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,990
I thought it sounded
just like Yoon Hee.

415
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,266
Had it not been for that incident,

416
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,206
Yoon Hee would've certainly made it
to Seoul University of Music.

417
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,905
She was the top-class
at Cheong A Arts School,

418
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:22,530
and won the grand prize
at every competition.

419
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,115
That's all history.

420
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,899
I don't even sing anymore.

421
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,816
Seo Jin, you really aren't
feeling well.

422
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,556
You're not even drinking.

423
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Are you okay?

424
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,925
Right. You all know too, right?

425
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,550
The Hera Place incident.

426
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,496
Yoon Hee had quite the life
in the last few years.

427
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,020
From murder charges to running away.

428
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,605
It's nice to see you be free...

429
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:51,730
at last.

430
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,905
Why are you bringing that up now?

431
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,129
Why? Does it make you uncomfortable?

432
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,940
You joined us because you're fine
with all of that now, right?

433
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,500
You're right.

434
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,786
I was falsely accused,

435
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,716
but I've been proven innocent.

436
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,040
I'm as happy as can be now.

437
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:10,879
I'm a little shy to say,

438
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,820
but I got married again.

439
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:15,550
- Really?
- No way!

440
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,026
- Really?
- To who?

441
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,466
- When?
- Girl!

442
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,135
What does your husband do?

443
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,006
He's a businessman.

444
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,766
You wouldn't know him
even if I said the company's name.

445
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,006
It's called JohnBIO.

446
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,206
I know that company!

447
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,076
It's a huge hit in the US.

448
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,629
- Really?
- No way.

449
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:33,916
What business is it?

450
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,375
I'm going to the bathroom.

451
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,770
Stop looking him up.
I'm embarrassed.

452
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,799
I can't believe you got remarried.

453
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,056
This man is Seo Jin's ex-husband.

454
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,956
He was a neurosurgeon
at Cheong A Medical Center.

455
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,490
- You're right.
- Really?

456
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,790
Did you get remarried
to Seo Jin's ex-husband?

457
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,189
Yes, it just happened.

458
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,969
Oh Yoon Hee...

459
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,679
I'll kill you.

460
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:24,250
It's so good to see you.

461
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:27,095
Tell us the truth
since Seo Jin isn't here.

462
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,135
Back then,

463
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,189
did you really
stab yourself in the neck?

464
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,000
It was just Seo Jin and you
in the room.

465
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:36,746
We couldn't say anything back then,

466
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,330
but nobody believed it.

467
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,199
We all thought that Seo Jin
stabbed you.

468
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:43,840
Tell us already.

469
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:45,840
What's the truth?

470
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,395
Come on.

471
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:59,125
Ask Seo Jin yourself.

472
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,835
She knows the truth too.

473
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,506
- Come on!
- Just tell us.

474
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,830
- Why can't you tell us?
- Tell us.

475
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,576
You're hilarious.

476
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,429
Come on.

477
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,516
Mr. Ha, what a game.

478
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,139
Unbelievable.

479
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,256
Is it not Player Joo's day today?

480
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,716
Would you please shut it?

481
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,355
I can't focus!

482
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:26,480
He's taking the anger out on us.

483
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,095
I hear one's real personality
comes out when they lose money.

484
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,719
This proves that right.

485
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,189
Should we stop here?

486
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:35,036
You've lost almost all of it.

487
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,260
Who do you think you are,
just ending the game whenever?

488
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:41,899
Let's go big one last round.

489
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,830
Can you be all in?

490
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,969
If not,

491
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,076
we can stop here.

492
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,740
I don't mind.

493
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
All right, then.

494
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:57,409
You're so cool, Ha Yoon Chul!

495
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,280
Let's play one last round
with everything in.

496
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,550
Sure.

497
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,760
These four cards are
very important.

498
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,689
- I'm nervous.
- Same here.

499
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,306
Finding the right timing to die is
the key to poker,

500
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,675
just like in life,

501
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:19,299
you must die before
you're 50 to remarry.

502
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:21,476
(Kyu Jin's)

503
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,716
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

504
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,740
Is he drinking out somewhere again?

505
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:31,355
His wife is working her bones off...

506
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:34,020
to volunteer in his district
all day long,

507
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:39,590
but he's out there,
living his best life.

508
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,889
I can't believe he's an assemblyman.

509
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,689
That's why our country is like this.

510
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,939
It's hard to read their faces.

511
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,310
What was that?

512
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,550
- What a game!
- Oh, my.

513
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,820
Chairman Joo, I'm sorry.

514
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,419
It's four Aces.

515
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,260
No way.

516
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh, my.

517
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,375
Mr. Ha, did you only play poker
when you were in the US?

518
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:26,615
You're like a hoodwinker now.

519
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,615
I just got lucky.
It's beginner's luck.

520
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:33,139
Chairman Joo, how much
have you lost today?

521
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,780
A million dollars?

522
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,050
Let's play again sometime.

523
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,326
I won't go easy on you next time.

524
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,350
Thanks.

525
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,226
"Go easy"?

526
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,790
I saw you use your full brain power.

527
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,090
Bye!

528
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,506
Mr. Ha, you have to treat us
big time.

529
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,699
No, not today. It's time
for my wife to come back.

530
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Next time.

531
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,000
Just let me off this time.

532
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:04,169
Come on!

533
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,709
I can't sleep well...

534
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,756
if I drink just a little like this.

535
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,520
What's there to worry about?

536
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,119
You can drink with me.

537
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,790
Just us two?

538
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,690
What are you saying?

539
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,790
That's not fun.

540
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,945
Do you not remember things...

541
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:33,815
when you get drunk?

542
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,569
No, I remember everything just fine.

543
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,279
Then do you remember?

544
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,250
You and I recently, you know,

545
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,949
did things.

546
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,336
What? What are you saying?

547
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,830
Are you serious?

548
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:01,905
You were the one who started.
Why are you acting innocent?

549
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:04,246
Do you not remember or what?

550
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,746
What did I do?

551
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,040
Why do you keep saying that?

552
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:21,850
You remember now, don't you?

553
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:25,449
Oh, my.

554
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,789
What are you trying to do?
What are you plotting?

555
00:36:00,189 --> 00:36:02,050
Are you trying to kill me
with anxiety?

556
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:07,789
Why are you so scared,
Cheon Seo Jin?

557
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,530
That's not like you.

558
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,660
Relax.

559
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,430
I haven't even started yet.

560
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,010
I know you're in a rush,
so you're just coming at me,

561
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,340
but you're so pathetic
that I feel bad.

562
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,780
The more you do this,

563
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:33,550
the more I'm itching to expose you.

564
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,660
You want me to expose you?

565
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:40,490
And tell the world that
your singing is fake?

566
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,360
That the one who made it
a successful performance was...

567
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,630
me, Oh Yoon Hee?

568
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,900
Tell me what you want.

569
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,910
Tell me exactly
what you want from me.

570
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,059
Retire.

571
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,990
- What?
- Retire.

572
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,160
You've stepped on others,

573
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,300
stole others' opportunities,

574
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:22,999
and got there by faking.
So, let that all go yourself.

575
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:27,869
Aren't you ashamed to be called...

576
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:30,939
the best soprano of the time?

577
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,019
I didn't get here by faking.

578
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,966
I tried with all my life
to get here.

579
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,050
But you got off on the wrong foot.

580
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,459
You cut my throat...

581
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,660
and crushed my dreams.

582
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:50,630
But you didn't get punished.

583
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,999
So, everything you have right now...

584
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,900
is fake.

585
00:37:57,939 --> 00:38:00,410
Cancel all of your planned
performances.

586
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,869
Hold a press conference...

587
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,439
and tell the world
that you can't sing anymore.

588
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,780
Then, I'll keep it a secret...

589
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,119
that I was your shadow singer.

590
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,450
How does that sound?

591
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:18,090
It sounds like
a generous deal to me.

592
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:24,059
Singing is my life.

593
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,400
It was...

594
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,046
also my life.

595
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,470
Oh Yoon Hee!

596
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:32,740
How does this Saturday sound...

597
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,539
for the press conference?

598
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:39,340
That's the press conference day
for your opera.

599
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,249
There will be lots of domestic
and international reporters.

600
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:44,380
Won't that be a good day for it?

601
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:54,530
All right. Go as far as you'd like.

602
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,200
I won't beg you.

603
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:02,900
Don't you underestimate me.

604
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:07,510
I'm different from Su Ryeon.

605
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:10,840
You should go and think...

606
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,650
about how much you'll lose
and how your downfall will go.

607
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,289
Does your daughter know?

608
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:26,789
That you're going around,
being like this?

609
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,850
Didn't your daughter leave you...

610
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:33,970
because she's mortified
by this side of you?

611
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,400
And that's why you came back here
on your own, right?

612
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,150
Shouldn't you worry
about your daughter first?

613
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:53,490
My plan includes...

614
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:58,490
your daughter too.

615
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:09,030
Don't you lay a finger
on my daughter.

616
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,700
Not Eun Byeol!

617
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,680
Oh Yoon Hee!

618
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,979
Oh Yoon Hee!

619
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,860
How was the dinner tonight?

620
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,176
It was okay.

621
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,276
Would you like a cocktail
at the lounge?

622
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,470
I'm exhausted.
With the fan meet and interviews,

623
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,039
I'm completely beat.

624
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,010
Come on.

625
00:40:56,919 --> 00:41:00,320
I'll take care of Oh Yoon Hee.

626
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,689
Hera Palace is mine
and I sell it to who I want.

627
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,160
I have that much power.

628
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:16,329
Don't bother her. Don't anger her!

629
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,245
What do you mean?

630
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,010
At least for a little while.

631
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:25,539
Just let her be.

632
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,470
What could it be?

633
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:59,740
What does Cheon Seo Jin have...

634
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,079
to be afraid of Oh Yoon Hee?

635
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,360
It's me, Joo Dan Tae. Can we meet?

636
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:25,070
Did something happen to Director?

637
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:28,639
That's what I'd like to ask.

638
00:42:29,169 --> 00:42:30,340
Secretary Do,

639
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,650
what have you done
that things are looking this messy?

640
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:37,426
You've caused this big
of an accident,

641
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,095
and left Director to clean up
on her own?

642
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,019
Can you really call yourself
her manager after this?

643
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:46,966
I don't know what you're saying.

644
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,829
What happened with Oh Yoon Hee.

645
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,229
I've heard it all
from Director Cheon.

646
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,070
Until when were you planning
on hiding it from me?

647
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,939
If that broke out,

648
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,410
didn't you think that it'd break
her career?

649
00:43:06,979 --> 00:43:10,325
She was threatened just now...

650
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:12,380
by Oh Yoon Hee.

651
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:15,126
If the woman I'm marrying is
going through this,

652
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,265
I should've been the first to know.

653
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:19,720
Why didn't you say anything?

654
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,329
Secretary Do!

655
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:28,700
It's all my fault.

656
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,015
When Director Cheon had
vocal cord nodules,

657
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:34,145
I should've made her cancel
her performance.

658
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:36,840
She obviously would've wanted
to go forward with it.

659
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:39,579
I must've been fooled by the broker.

660
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,050
I was very secretive when I looked
for the replacement singer,

661
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,619
and I had no idea
that Oh Yoon Hee could sing.

662
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,550
I checked over and over again,

663
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:51,019
but she completely masked
her identity.

664
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:54,329
I'm so sorry, Chairman.

665
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:59,099
You're saying,

666
00:44:00,729 --> 00:44:02,630
Oh Yoon Hee sang...

667
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:05,700
for Cheon Seo Jin
at her performance?

668
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,280
This is amusing.

669
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:22,019
You didn't know?

670
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,289
You said you knew everything...

671
00:44:29,389 --> 00:44:30,530
Did you...

672
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:35,200
It's time for you to choose now.

673
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,176
Will you join me now? Or...

674
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,269
will you get fired by Seo Jin...

675
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,010
for running your mouth recklessly?

676
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,619
What are you doing? You startled me.

677
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,019
Why are you here at this hour?

678
00:45:28,189 --> 00:45:29,709
I was going to give you
a wake-up call,

679
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,619
but I wanted to see you sleeping.

680
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,430
How about breakfast?

681
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,900
Don't do that again.

682
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,930
I was tossing and turning all night
and barely fell asleep.

683
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:44,639
You're too irritable.

684
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,809
The concert went well,
and many good things are happening.

685
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,639
Do you have a concern
that I don't know about...

686
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,639
or something?

687
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,849
A concern? Of course, not.

688
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,849
I'll wash up and come out.

689
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,650
Have some coffee and wait for me.

690
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:16,269
Oh Yoon Hee.
She really is impressive.

691
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,245
If I can use her properly,

692
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:20,910
she'll be useful in taming Seo Jin.

693
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:30,880
What are you doing?

694
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,619
Isn't it obvious?

695
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:39,035
Can't you have breakfast
at your penthouse?

696
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:40,406
I'm a high school senior.

697
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,865
It hurts my studies
if I'm in a bad mood.

698
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:45,049
Please stop talking.
You're making me lose my appetite.

699
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,475
What?

700
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:48,130
You said I didn't need to try.

701
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,816
So I'm going to drop the act.

702
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,369
I hate doing things
that are inefficient.

703
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,840
I can't stand you.

704
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:19,930
I love this place.

705
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:24,039
I made lots of friends
at school today.

706
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,475
I have you with me...

707
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:27,899
and I'm getting used to the school.

708
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,169
I'm so happy, I could die.

709
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,079
Ro Na.

710
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:40,256
I need to tell you something.

711
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,119
What is it?
You're making me nervous.

712
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,959
Just spit it out. Stop scaring me.

713
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:48,860
I have to go...

714
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,729
to Korea.

715
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:52,999
Why?

716
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,269
I can't live happily with you...

717
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:58,639
like nothing happened.

718
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,869
I...

719
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:06,240
I feel like I can't breathe.

720
00:48:07,749 --> 00:48:10,349
I feel so guilty toward Su Ryeon.

721
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,296
You didn't kill her.

722
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,849
So why do you feel guilty?

723
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:15,450
I don't understand.

724
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:18,160
Still, I have to go.

725
00:48:18,419 --> 00:48:20,630
I know I shouldn't do this to you,

726
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,829
but I have to go.

727
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,930
No, Mom.

728
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,970
Just live here with me.

729
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,575
Let's forget everything
that happened in Korea.

730
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,169
I'll pray...

731
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:35,915
that Ms. Shim and her daughter
will meet...

732
00:48:35,939 --> 00:48:38,216
and live happily together
in their next life.

733
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,539
So please, don't go.

734
00:48:39,979 --> 00:48:41,180
I...

735
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:46,919
killed that girl.

736
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:49,119
What?

737
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,189
I did that to Min Seol A,

738
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,889
Su Ryeon's daughter.

739
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,130
I'm sorry.

740
00:49:03,729 --> 00:49:04,970
Liar.

741
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,269
Why are you lying?

742
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:11,680
You would never.

743
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:15,410
I'll pay...

744
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,749
for what I did.

745
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,249
Did you do it on purpose?

746
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:22,849
Because of me?

747
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,535
To get me into Cheong A?

748
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:28,765
No. It was definitely not
on purpose.

749
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:30,535
How could you kill her...

750
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,530
and move into her home...

751
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:34,970
and be happy
that it went up in value?

752
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:36,975
You're a monster.

753
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:39,216
You're scary! You make me sick!
You give me chills!

754
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,145
I really didn't remember
anything at the time.

755
00:49:41,169 --> 00:49:43,615
It's true, Ro Na. Please believe me.

756
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,309
Stop it!

757
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:47,950
You're saying you killed her.

758
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,386
You killed Min Seol A because of me!

759
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,395
You're saying my mom is a murderer!

760
00:49:52,419 --> 00:49:54,566
No. It wasn't because of you.

761
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,419
It was definitely not
because of you.

762
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:58,636
This is all me.

763
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,966
You had nothing to do with it.

764
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,165
So please, don't blame yourself.

765
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:03,559
Why did you tell me?

766
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:06,499
You should've kept it
a secret forever.

767
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,676
What am I supposed to do?

768
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,439
How am I supposed to live
with this guilt?

769
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,269
Ro Na. Ro Na!

770
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,019
Don't forgive me.

771
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,260
Hate me and resent me forever.

772
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,530
Did you confess to your daughter...

773
00:50:43,229 --> 00:50:46,439
that you killed Seol A?

774
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,650
This is the last favor
I'll ask of you.

775
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,479
Please make sure...

776
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,050
Ro Na never goes back to Korea.

777
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:05,820
If you do that...

778
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,260
I'll do anything you want.

779
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,769
Don't worry about Ro Na.

780
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:18,240
I'll keep her with me.

781
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:28,610
You can't come here, Ro Na.

782
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:34,320
Not until I destroy
those evil people.

783
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,930
Are you preparing
for the press conference?

784
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,915
Don't forget. It's this Saturday.

785
00:51:52,939 --> 00:51:54,139
You crazy little...

786
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,820
Come in.

787
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,789
How have you been?

788
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,709
It's been two years now.

789
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,280
Why...

790
00:52:41,189 --> 00:52:42,419
are you...

791
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,329
Re-enroll?

792
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,636
Did you just say "re-enroll"?

793
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,269
Yes. I came because I want
to re-enroll at Cheong A.

794
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:00,340
Sorry, but that's impossible.

795
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:04,639
There's no opening.

796
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,749
And I have no desire to go
out of our way to accept you.

797
00:53:09,749 --> 00:53:10,955
Does that answer your question?

798
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,150
I knew you'd say that.

799
00:53:14,689 --> 00:53:18,090
But you'll have to admit me.

800
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,559
Are you doing this...

801
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,030
because you think
you can rely on your mom?

802
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:52,165
- Oh my gosh. Gosh.
- Is it good?

803
00:53:52,189 --> 00:53:54,906
You look the prettiest
when you're drinking soda.

804
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,236
Drink faster.

805
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,260
Seok Kyung.

806
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:06,276
Cut it out already.

807
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,570
Stay out of it, Seok Hoon.

808
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,316
She's drinking it voluntarily
because she's thirsty.

809
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,139
Stay out of it.

810
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,050
I said, cut it out.

811
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,150
Me?

812
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,119
I'm not the Min Hyuk
you used to know.

813
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:25,459
How dare you?

814
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,970
You guys haven't changed a bit.

815
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:40,669
Bae Ro Na?

816
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:45,680
Gosh, seriously.

817
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:49,849
Jenny, are you okay?

818
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:53,626
Hey, how dare you show up
at our school?

819
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,590
You guys haven't quit this yet?

820
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:57,935
How can you still be the same
after what happened?

821
00:54:57,959 --> 00:55:00,389
What is she saying?

822
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,829
Guys, I think I broke my arm.

823
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,700
I broke my arm!

824
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:12,499
That hurts!

825
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,510
Bae Ro Na won first prize
at the Elizabeth Competition?

826
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,615
According to our school rules,

827
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,910
an international competition winner
is allowed to re-enroll.

828
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,249
This is hot news.

829
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:28,595
Isn't she the country's
youngest winner so far?

830
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:31,619
- I should ask the PR team to...
- Do you think...

831
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,459
I called you here
to ask you to do that?

832
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,459
Pardon?

833
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,176
I need the head of
the art department to step in.

834
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,205
While studying here,

835
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:47,269
Bae Ro Na got in a lot of trouble.

836
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,986
If she re-enroll,
she might distract the seniors.

837
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:55,950
Don't you think
she'll raise an issue?

838
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:59,479
The school rules clearly state that
she may re-enroll.

839
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:03,990
But we can't let Bae Ro Na
come back here.

840
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:05,736
Find a way.

841
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,030
Can't you do that much
as the head of the art department?

842
00:56:18,999 --> 00:56:20,700
Hello, Ms. Ko.

843
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:23,970
An accident?

844
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:37,566
Where's Ro Na?

845
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:38,820
Don't tell me...

846
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,860
you're here as Ro Na's guardian.

847
00:56:42,729 --> 00:56:44,836
Did you forget that
Eun Byeol goes to this school?

848
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,406
What if she sees you?

849
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:49,030
Stop picking a fight.
Just explain what happened.

850
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:53,269
I already told you everything
on the phone.

851
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:56,610
Ro Na kicked Min Hyuk
to the ground,

852
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,555
and Min Hyuk ended up in the ER.

853
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:00,139
Cheong A Medical Center, right?

854
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,555
I'll go there.

855
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:04,579
I'll call you when I know how he is.
Don't worry too much.

856
00:57:04,749 --> 00:57:06,349
Make sure Ro Na is okay.

857
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,959
Was Ro Na really here?

858
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,119
Why?

859
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,900
You really don't know?

860
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:22,475
She came with a prize
from international competition,

861
00:57:22,499 --> 00:57:25,240
asking to be re-admitted.

862
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,470
I thought you sent her.

863
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:29,139
She did?

864
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:35,110
Where is she now?

865
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,095
As you may guess,
because of this violent incident,

866
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:40,050
she won't be able
to re-enter the school.

867
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,349
Since she isn't our student, she
won't be disciplined by the school,

868
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:47,189
she's likely to be investigated
by the police.

869
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,499
Explain what happened
so I can understand.

870
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:57,106
Bae Ro Na popped out of nowhere
and kicked Min Hyuk.

871
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,200
Jenny threw up from the shock.

872
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,685
- You all saw that, right?
- Yes.

873
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:04,216
- I saw it.
- I saw it too.

874
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,039
She's extremely strong.

875
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,950
I didn't do that.

876
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,610
They're lying.

877
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:15,889
You guys were bullying Jenny.

878
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:17,495
Why are you leaving that out?

879
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:19,389
They were bullying Jenny?

880
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:22,430
But they're our school's
model students.

881
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:26,329
Jenny, you tell me.

882
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,530
Did they bully you?

883
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,880
No.

884
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,785
We were just fooling around.

885
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,110
Jenny, how could you...

886
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:50,019
Ro Na!

887
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,729
Are you out of your mind?

888
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,876
Why are you back here?

889
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,200
Why would you come back
to this horrible place?

890
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:07,300
I want to graduate.

891
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:10,586
I also want the Cheong A
Art Festival grand prize trophy.

892
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,209
I don't need any of that.
Go back right now.

893
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:15,656
I don't care about Seoul National
University, the grand prize,

894
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,555
or something even better.

895
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:19,979
I don't care. I mean it.

896
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,789
Do you think I sing because of you?

897
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,127
What?

898
00:59:24,151 --> 00:59:26,590
I'm not trying to win
the grand prize because of you.

899
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,930
It's for me.
I'm doing it for myself.

900
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,205
I want to go back
to Cheong A Arts High School.

901
00:59:32,229 --> 00:59:35,130
And I'm going to enter
Cheong A Art Festival.

902
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,845
I have to.

903
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:39,200
Why? Why do you have to?

904
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:41,340
No.

905
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:45,840
Please go back to the US, okay?

906
00:59:45,939 --> 00:59:47,615
Haven't you been through enough?

907
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:50,249
Who knows what they'll do to you?

908
00:59:50,979 --> 00:59:53,249
Are you scared that I'll be bullied?

909
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:59,119
You're always so selfish.

910
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,535
Now that you know I'm alive,

911
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,099
can I go?

912
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,700
Ro Na!

913
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,265
Do you think
this can put things right?

914
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:32,095
My boy broke his arm!

915
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:35,836
His iron arm!

916
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,636
How can Ro Na be so strong?

917
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,176
I am a cultured woman,

918
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,876
but no one can stop me
when it comes to my boy!

919
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,400
Anyway, how are you going
to take responsibility for this?

920
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:49,145
My mom is filing a suit.

921
01:00:49,169 --> 01:00:51,015
She's so upset that
she's refusing to eat.

922
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:53,415
An assemblyman's son...

923
01:00:53,439 --> 01:00:56,486
was bullied at school!
How can this be possible?

924
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:58,526
The doctor said
he doesn't need to wear a cast,

925
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,820
but you insisted on it.

926
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:05,490
We're neighbors.
Give us a little break.

927
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,566
Mr. Ha! I'm disappointed in you.

928
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,459
Just because you're successful
doesn't mean you can be shameless!

929
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:14,800
I'm not going to...

930
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,039
let this slide.

931
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:20,669
Let's deal with it legally.

932
01:01:21,269 --> 01:01:24,309
We're not going to settle
or go easy on you.

933
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,079
Then again, she's
a murderer's daughter.

934
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,785
She's so used to violence.

935
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:32,595
Come on. Hit me too.

936
01:01:32,619 --> 01:01:35,189
Don't talk that way
about my wife and daughter!

937
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,665
Since you've been an attorney,
you must know that...

938
01:01:41,689 --> 01:01:44,999
what you just said
counts as defamation.

939
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,269
Say anything like that again,

940
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,530
I'll rip your mouth out.

941
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,300
Hey.

942
01:01:55,709 --> 01:01:57,169
It's not like...

943
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,749
she's your first wife
and Ro Na is your real daughter.

944
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:20,729
Right.

945
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,030
This might be my chance.

946
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,110
Ro Na might be able to protect me.

947
01:02:38,479 --> 01:02:40,450
Hello? Who...

948
01:02:45,919 --> 01:02:47,189
Ro Na?

949
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:58,546
Ro Na, what are you doing here?

950
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,376
Your daughter showed up
out of nowhere...

951
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,039
and is begging me
to re-admit her to the school.

952
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:05,939
Get up. Get up right now!

953
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:11,895
I won't cause any trouble at school.

954
01:03:11,919 --> 01:03:13,225
I promise.

955
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:16,519
If anything happens,
I'll pay for it.

956
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:19,836
So please let me come back.

957
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,305
I want to graduate from
Cheong A Arts High School.

958
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:23,665
I beg you.

959
01:03:23,689 --> 01:03:25,435
What are you talking about?

960
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:28,106
- Why would you beg for that?
- Let go.

961
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:30,070
This is none of your business.

962
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,115
You used to be my student.

963
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:36,645
Seeing you beg so desperately,
I feel bad.

964
01:03:36,669 --> 01:03:38,380
I'll do think about it.

965
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:40,309
On one condition.

966
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:44,256
Bring me a written promise
from your mom that...

967
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,249
she won't cause any trouble
and will cooperate with the school.

968
01:03:47,919 --> 01:03:49,796
Otherwise, I can't trust her.

969
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,459
I can do that.

970
01:03:52,189 --> 01:03:54,966
- I'll take care of it.
- Ro Na, how could you...

971
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,590
Fine. You may leave.

972
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,869
What are you doing?

973
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:13,086
Ro Na will not attend Cheong A.

974
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,455
I won't allow it.

975
01:04:14,479 --> 01:04:16,455
I thought you'd be very grateful.

976
01:04:16,479 --> 01:04:17,550
I'm surprised.

977
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:18,979
Why is that?

978
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:21,349
I don't want her to go.

979
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,825
Whether or not you want it,

980
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:27,035
as the director, I'll decide
according to school policy.

981
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:30,205
I don't want people to accuse me
of keeping your daughter out...

982
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:32,559
because of
my ill feelings toward you.

983
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:34,360
I'm an educator after all.

984
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:38,400
An educator?

985
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,769
You must be trying to cut a deal...

986
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,345
using Ro Na...

987
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:44,570
I think...

988
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:50,910
we should bury that now.

989
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:54,349
If you want Min Hyuk's issue
to be resolved favorably.

990
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:57,526
If word gets out that she assaulted
an assemblyman's son,

991
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,289
it'll be a stumbling block for her.
Is that what you want?

992
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,705
Even if you want her
to go back to school in the US,

993
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:05,030
you should make sure she
doesn't have a prior for assault.

994
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:07,160
You conniving witch.

995
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:11,376
Do you think you can make it
go away just like that?

996
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,639
What do you gain
by hurting my reputation?

997
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:18,115
Do you not care
if you destroy Ro Na's life...

998
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:19,610
just to get me?

999
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,010
If you do anything to her,

1000
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:25,256
I will make you regret it.

1001
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,380
That...

1002
01:05:33,419 --> 01:05:35,459
depends on you now.

1003
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:55,510
Ro Na. Why are you doing this to me?

1004
01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:58,296
Please, go back to the US. Please.

1005
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,419
Do you want me...

1006
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,550
to hide somewhere
you can never find me?

1007
01:06:02,889 --> 01:06:05,360
Or must I expose you...

1008
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,860
for what you did?

1009
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,829
Ro Na.

1010
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,900
Don't try to do anything for me
ever again.

1011
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,630
I'll take care of myself.

1012
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,439
Where are you going at this hour?

1013
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:24,639
Ro Na. Please talk to me!

1014
01:06:36,419 --> 01:06:37,789
What do you mean?

1015
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,619
Don't raise your voice at the table.

1016
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,389
Why are you accepting Ro Na?

1017
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:45,176
What are you thinking?

1018
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,599
I don't want to go to
the same school with her!

1019
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:51,030
You're the director.
Can't you stop something like that?

1020
01:06:53,539 --> 01:06:56,840
Are you whining because
you're scared of someone like her?

1021
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:00,015
You're the top student right now.

1022
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:02,910
I think it would be good for you
to have a pacemaker.

1023
01:07:03,709 --> 01:07:04,809
Is this...

1024
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:07,325
about Cheong A Art Festival?

1025
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:09,165
In case you lose to Ro Na?

1026
01:07:09,189 --> 01:07:11,395
That will never happen.

1027
01:07:11,419 --> 01:07:14,435
I won't lose to a loser like her.

1028
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:17,430
That's right. Now, that's my girl.

1029
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,260
It's a blessing...

1030
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,829
to have a rival.

1031
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:26,369
Discussion over, okay?

1032
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,145
Finish eating.

1033
01:07:30,169 --> 01:07:31,510
I have plans.

1034
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,280
This isn't about the stupid trophy!

1035
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:44,249
She doesn't know anything.

1036
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:50,189
You must be upset...

1037
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,700
that Seok Hoon
will go back to Ro Na, aren't you?

1038
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,570
Yes.

1039
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:00,400
I'm so nervous.

1040
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,079
Seok Hoon is the only one for me.

1041
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:07,539
Do you want me to call him?

1042
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,249
I got the sample questions
for the mock exam.

1043
01:08:14,919 --> 01:08:17,349
I have an important meeting,
so I'm still at the office.

1044
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:20,265
I'll see you at the hotel.
I won't be late. How do you feel?

1045
01:08:20,289 --> 01:08:22,459
Not bad.

1046
01:08:22,789 --> 01:08:26,130
I'm excited
about spending time with you.

1047
01:08:26,929 --> 01:08:28,229
So am I.

1048
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:29,599
I love you.

1049
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:35,309
Okay... So this...

1050
01:08:36,139 --> 01:08:39,780
is proof that someone else sang
at Seo Jin's concert, correct?

1051
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:42,686
I included messages
exchanged with the broker.

1052
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,750
(Non-Disclosure Agreement)

1053
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,379
You're a very good worker.

1054
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:51,960
No wonder Seo Jin
trusts you so much.

1055
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,905
May I assume our relationship
has become stronger through this?

1056
01:08:55,929 --> 01:08:58,030
This is where it ends between us.

1057
01:08:58,429 --> 01:08:59,729
If you demand more,

1058
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:02,370
I'll have to tell Ms. Cheon.

1059
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,040
Hearing you say that
makes me trust you more.

1060
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,469
I won't take your calls anymore.

1061
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:52,780
Where are you?

1062
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,889
Hurry up. I want to see you.

1063
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:01,290
Eun Byeol.

1064
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:05,500
Eun Byeol?

1065
01:10:17,769 --> 01:10:18,780
Are you inside?

1066
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,250
Are you here?

1067
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:27,750
Who are you?

1068
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,229
What are you doing?

1069
01:10:38,629 --> 01:10:39,860
Why are you here?

1070
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:42,405
(The Penthouse 2)

1071
01:11:42,429 --> 01:11:44,535
You deceived me
and met another man.

1072
01:11:44,559 --> 01:11:46,575
How long have you been
keeping secrets from me?

1073
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:49,046
We have no legal obligations
to each other yet.

1074
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:50,846
I wondered how you were doing.

1075
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,615
Didn't you wonder about me?

1076
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:54,976
I'm acting in order to get you back.

1077
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,646
Shut it! Your mom is the one
who killed my mom.

1078
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:59,516
You promised to protect Ro Na.

1079
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,115
I'll do whatever it takes...

1080
01:12:01,139 --> 01:12:03,256
to get the Cheong A
Art Festival trophy.

1081
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,257
You've got some nerve.

1082
01:12:04,281 --> 01:12:07,219
I may just kill your daughter
Seok Kyung.
