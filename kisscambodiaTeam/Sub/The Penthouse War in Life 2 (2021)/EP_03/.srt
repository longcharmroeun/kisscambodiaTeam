THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,055
AND BACKGROUND OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL.

00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,955
EPISODE 3

4
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:34,493
I don't believe this.
That was a perfect high F.

5
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,754
What happened? You didn't say
you'd raise it to a high F.

6
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:58,183
It's hard enough to hit it after a break.

7
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,493
It's nearly impossible
to hit it in one breath.

8
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:03,053
Did you intentionally hold
back what you could do?

9
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:08,333
You.

10
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,364
Who are you?

11
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,303
Who are you?

12
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:27,213
How...

13
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,623
How are you...

14
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:34,824
Finally, I get to say hi.

15
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:38,224
I hope we get along from now on, Seo Jin.

16
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,134
How...

17
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:46,403
did you get in here?

18
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:50,174
Shouldn't you thank me?

19
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:52,604
How can you sing?

20
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:56,644
Your vocal cords were ruined.

21
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:59,544
Yes, thanks to you.

22
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,914
I guess it's a miracle.

23
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:05,454
I got the surgery done,

24
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:07,824
and I'm completely recovered.

25
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,234
My throat that you stabbed
with your trophy...

26
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:20,474
saved you from embarrassment today.

27
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:24,074
Isn't life so funny?

28
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:25,243
You...

29
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,373
really sang that?

30
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,414
No way.

31
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,313
I certainly talked to Park Young Ran.

32
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:45,294
The number you have dialed is not registered.

33
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:47,463
Please check the number again.

34
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:48,493
Why?

35
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:52,003
Are you flustered because
the number doesn't exist?

36
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,033
PARK YOUNG RAN

37
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,343
Did you set this up?

38
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:02,574
Did you set it up to fool me?

39
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:05,713
How could you? Did you stalk me?

40
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,253
How did you find out that
my voice was having issues?

41
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:14,253
Take your things and get out right now.

42
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:17,364
I don't care whether you two
got married for real or not.

43
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,024
- But you can't live here.
- Why not?

44
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,734
Your daughter, Eun Byeol, lives here.

45
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:25,003
Don't you care if she gets hurt?

46
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:27,074
Do you call yourself her dad?

47
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:28,074
INSTALLED

48
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,503
Why are you so scared?

49
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:34,044
No one who made a debut.

50
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:36,013
Find an amateur.

51
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:39,414
She can't be too young or too
old. She has to be around my age.

52
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:42,154
We don't have time. We have a week.

53
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:45,284
This concert must be perfect...

54
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:47,724
no matter what.

55
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:54,294
What do you want?

56
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,563
There must be a reason why
you're doing all of this!

57
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,803
I'm just getting back everything...

58
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:01,003
that you took away from me.

59
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:02,904
You remember, right?

60
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:05,643
The best voice and Yoon
Chul were both mine...

61
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,373
initially.

62
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:09,614
What did you just say?

63
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:14,513
Who would've thought that you'd
look for someone to lip-sync to?

64
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:17,553
Life is full of surprises, don't you think?

65
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:24,393
Cheon Seo Jin, the fake soprano.

66
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,164
She's right there!

67
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:36,104
Congratulations on making new
history in Korea's music scene!

68
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:38,104
Tell us how you feel about the
best performance you just had.

69
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,214
You've proven yourself to everyone
despite the retirement rumors.

70
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,513
You must've felt so pressured as a soprano.

71
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:44,914
How did you overcome that?

72
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:47,513
What's the secret to your perfect voice?

73
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,183
You're the biggest star. Please say a word.

74
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:53,693
Seo Jin, that was an
amazing performance today.

75
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:55,024
Congratulations.

76
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,964
This is just the beginning. Just you wait.

77
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:02,193
I'm going to get my place back.

78
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:08,834
Thank you.

79
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:12,303
I'd like to be interviewed
officially tomorrow.

80
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:13,943
I need some rest.

81
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:16,344
Secretary Do, please
schedule the interviews...

82
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,313
at their best convenience.

83
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,513
- Please!
- Just one thing.

84
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,154
- Please say a word.
- Please get out.

85
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:23,553
- Ms. Cheon!
- Please!

86
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:26,453
See you tomorrow.

87
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:44,073
That was so amazing.

88
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,614
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

89
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,073
Let's go.

90
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,924
How have you been?

91
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:11,164
I know I have no right to say this,

92
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:14,334
but I miss you so much.

93
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,274
Sorry.

94
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,813
Give me a little time.

95
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:28,354
I'll uncover the truth behind
what happened that day...

96
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:31,584
even if it kills me.

97
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:33,524
And...

98
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:39,193
I'll pay for my sins too. I promise.

99
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,573
Here's to the 20th anniversary...

100
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:51,674
of the beautiful prima
donna Cheon Seo Jin's debut.

101
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,914
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

102
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:55,714
Congratulations.

103
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,823
I totally got goosebumps.

104
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:06,453
How could a human being make such a sound?

105
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:10,823
The reviews praising you are pouring in.

106
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:15,693
You really are the one and
only treasure of our country.

107
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,633
Is there anything that you lack?

108
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:21,404
You come from a good family.
You're the best in your field.

109
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:22,834
Your ex-husband is a doctor.

110
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,803
Your current boyfriend is
a successful businessman.

111
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,643
You got everything. Life is so unfair.

112
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:30,584
Chairman Joo is the one who has it good.

113
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,184
His business is thriving.

114
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:34,854
His future wife is successful.

115
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,584
He's besties with Kyu Jin.

116
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:40,493
He wouldn't change places even
with the president of Korea.

117
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:42,753
Thank you for celebrating with us.

118
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:44,623
Let's drink until late.

119
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:45,763
It's all on me.

120
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,964
Yes!

121
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:54,234
Your voice sounded very different from usual.

122
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:57,574
You raised the final note
to a high F, didn't you?

123
00:08:57,574 --> 00:08:59,074
Right?

124
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:02,714
I thought it was a different person too.

125
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:06,344
What's your secret? I want
to share it with Jenny.

126
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:07,614
Yes, how did you do it?

127
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,714
Did you pick up a new skill?

128
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:11,753
There's nothing like that.

129
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,763
That's right. I saw Oh Yoon
Hee at the concert tonight.

130
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:20,293
I wonder if Dr. Ha was with her.

131
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,434
That couple keeps elbowing their way in...

132
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,263
where they're not invited.

133
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,173
Oh Yoon Hee was there?

134
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:29,204
When? I didn't see her.

135
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:31,804
Let's stop talking about
useless things, and drink.

136
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:34,173
I'm sure she wanted to ruin a nice day.

137
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,143
She always considered Seo
Jin a rival all her life...

138
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,984
and survived on her inferiority complex.

139
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:40,513
She must've been jealous...

140
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,283
when she heard about her solo concert...

141
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:44,054
Yoon Hee wasn't there!

142
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,133
My apologies.

143
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:00,064
I don't feel too well.

144
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:02,503
Please excuse me.

145
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:06,773
But... Ms. Cheon...

146
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,243
What the...

147
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,614
What's wrong with her?

148
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:18,324
Let's reschedule the celebration.

149
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,993
Why is she being like that
on this happy occasion?

150
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,263
Something did happen.

151
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:26,964
I bet Oh Yoon Hee...

152
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:29,194
That goes without saying.

153
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:31,903
She's been irritable ever since she moved in.

154
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,564
She's such a brat.

155
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,704
That's why Dr. Ha switched
over to Oh Yoon Hee.

156
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:37,903
We'll have to watch what
we say for the time being.

157
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,844
I'm afraid it'll end up hurting the kids.

158
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:43,444
Her and her nasty temper.

159
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:45,984
Poor Chairman Joo. Poor guy.

160
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:47,684
Why is he marrying someone like her?

161
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:49,253
It's better to grow old alone.

162
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:51,484
He is affection-deprived.

163
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:08,533
Fake soprano Cheon Seo Jin.

164
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,584
Stop! Stop!

165
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,364
You need to project!

166
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,234
Don't you know how
important this audition is?

167
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:37,263
It's an opportunity to sing with
the best opera company in Italy.

168
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,503
They only wanted to see Yoon Hee,
the top student in the school,

169
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,133
but I forced your way in.

170
00:11:42,474 --> 00:11:44,304
I'll practice more, Father.

171
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,743
I can do it.

172
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:49,413
I know I can pass the audition.

173
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:52,513
Are you weeping because I nagged a little?

174
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:54,783
You know I can't stand seeing chicks cry.

175
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:55,954
Do it again!

176
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:08,064
How did it go?

177
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:12,033
Who made it, Yoon Hee or me?

178
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,503
Loser.

179
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,574
You can't beat her even once?

180
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:18,344
Then...

181
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,344
is Yoon Hee going to Italy?

182
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:23,944
I can't allow that.

183
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:27,984
We arranged it to say
Yoon Hee turned them down.

184
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,584
After what I did to get
you in, you almost lost it.

185
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,984
What a disgrace.

186
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:34,623
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:36,253
Let's go.

188
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:20,163
What's Eun Byeol doing?

189
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,533
She just fell asleep after
finishing her assignments.

190
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,373
Good work.

191
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,304
You should rest too.

192
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,243
Eun Byeol.

193
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,454
Finally, I can breathe.

194
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:12,954
My mom's engagement...

195
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:14,594
and my dad's return after
getting remarried...

196
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:17,153
were all annoying me and driving me crazy.

197
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:21,564
Thanks for coming with me, Seok Hoon.

198
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:26,163
Just hang on a few more months.

199
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:28,673
During your mom and my dad's wedding,

200
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:31,873
we'll drop our bombs and
each go our separate ways.

201
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,173
No one can find out before then.

202
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:54,163
You promised you wouldn't do this.

203
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,694
Can it really not be me?

204
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,163
Aren't you sick of asking me that?

205
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:00,633
I told you I'm not interested in you.

206
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,704
We have the same goal, that's all.

207
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:05,304
Ruining the wedding. Never becoming family.

208
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,574
You can't end up with Ro Na anyway.

209
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:14,253
You can use me to get over Ro Na. So...

210
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:17,584
Eun Byeol. I told you
not to say Ro Na's name.

211
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:24,263
It's late. Let's go.

212
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,033
Wait for me.

213
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:35,104
Thanks for taking me out.

214
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:37,403
Get home safely.

215
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:38,873
Sweet dreams.

216
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:42,913
Where did you go?

217
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:47,444
To the studio.

218
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:50,114
I couldn't study, so I
went to practice instead.

219
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:51,684
What are you doing?

220
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:54,594
I went swimming.

221
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,493
You're the top student.
Why are you trying so hard?

222
00:15:58,523 --> 00:15:59,694
Later.

223
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,133
She didn't hear me, did she?

224
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:15,444
Eun Byeol. So you're lying now.

225
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:18,383
Who's your boyfriend that
you were out this late?

226
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:24,184
Dr. Ha has been attending
business meetings...

227
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,883
or spending time with Oh Yoon Hee.

228
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,194
There hasn't been anything unusual.

229
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,653
What about her daughter?

230
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:31,923
I haven't seen her yet.

231
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:34,064
She hasn't seen her daughter.

232
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,503
Was Oh Yoon Hee at the concert?

233
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:43,834
Yes. She was in the dressing
room with Ms. Cheon.

234
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:47,373
She was with her.

235
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:49,314
I saw Oh Yoon Hee at the concert tonight.

236
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:51,314
Yoon Hee wasn't there!

237
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:55,714
Put a tail on Cheon Seo Jin too.

238
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,584
Report anything suspicious.

239
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,264
Cheon Seo Jin and Oh Yoon Hee.

240
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:10,764
I'm sure there's something
going on between the two.

241
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:20,844
I'm sorry, ma'am.

242
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:22,943
Is that it? "I'm sorry"?

243
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,683
Where did it go wrong?

244
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:27,544
How did Park Young Ran turn into Oh Yoon Hee?

245
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,354
Who is the woman I met?

246
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,354
The broker has disappeared.

247
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:34,653
I have nothing to say.

248
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,133
What is Oh Yoon Hee thinking?

249
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:51,574
How much does she know?

250
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:07,324
What are you making?

251
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,094
You startled me.

252
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:15,163
This is against our contract.

253
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:19,034
- Go have a seat.
- Okay.

254
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:22,933
You didn't have to prepare so much.

255
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:26,044
This is enough for breakfast.

256
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:28,413
I just prepared what I want.

257
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:32,344
What are you doing today?

258
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:35,153
You're not allowed to ask
questions like that, remember?

259
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:36,953
I'm pretty busy.

260
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:41,524
That looks good. Can I try?

261
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:43,054
No. It's mine.

262
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:46,423
You're so petty. Let me try.

263
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:49,264
- No.
- Let me just try a little.

264
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:52,233
Okay, just a little.

265
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:53,663
Here.

266
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,233
This is so good.

267
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:00,249
CHEONG A ARTS HIGH SCHOOL

268
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:09,683
Is Seok Hoon seeing a girl?

269
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:12,123
- What?
- He came back very late...

270
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:13,554
on his motorbike last night.

271
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:17,054
And he had two helmets.

272
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:19,864
- Could it be Bae Ro Na?
- Bae Ro Na?

273
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,163
Does that make sense to you?

274
00:19:21,163 --> 00:19:24,193
He was crazy for her.

275
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:27,463
Now that her mom has been acquitted,

276
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,074
what's stopping him?

277
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:32,473
He never liked her. He
was just fooling around.

278
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:36,114
If Bae Ro Na comes back and
bothers my brother again,

279
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:38,913
I won't sit back.

280
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:42,883
That's not going to happen.

281
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,953
She's not in Korea. Her mom said so.

282
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,294
She's still in the US.

283
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:50,594
Are you sure? She's not back yet?

284
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:52,663
Yes, I'm sure.

285
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:56,294
Thanks for the useful information.

286
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:58,334
You sure know everything
about your best friend.

287
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:01,433
That's not it. I just happened to hear...

288
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,844
Don't come to our study group meeting later.

289
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:07,044
A turncoat like you creeps me out.

290
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:14,514
Give me my backpack.

291
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,983
People will think I made you carry it.

292
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,883
Stop pretending to be nice.

293
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,024
Thank you. I appreciate it.

294
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,433
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

295
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,034
- I loved your concert.
- Can we take a picture together?

296
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:33,233
Of course. Here you go.

297
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:35,873
Here you go. Thank you.

298
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,703
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

299
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,274
Hello, what's your name?

300
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:44,683
It's Oh Yoon Hee.

301
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,084
What are you doing here?

302
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:56,824
I want your autograph too.

303
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:08,304
OH...

304
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,703
This is for you.

305
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,213
Open it.

306
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:27,793
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

307
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:30,923
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

308
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,486
CHEON SEO JIN, PARK YOUNG RAN

309
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,933
It seems like you've forgotten our agreement.

310
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:44,373
Don't worry. I'll keep my word.

311
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,314
Thanks for your autograph. I'll treasure it.

312
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,453
You're being more and more
recognized overseas as well.

313
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:04,893
Are you planning on any tours?

314
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:07,794
I feel like I still have a
lot to do in this country.

315
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,433
I'm going to take my time and think about it.

316
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,364
Many people are complimenting
that you sang...

317
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:14,304
your first piece in perfect
pitch like an instrument.

318
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:16,703
When will the live album be released?

319
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,274
I can't wait to listen to it.

320
00:22:20,244 --> 00:22:21,774
Well...

321
00:22:22,913 --> 00:22:25,483
Can't you sing it for us now?

322
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,344
"Una Voce Poco Fa".

323
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,114
That piece was absolutely beautiful.

324
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:33,084
Can we hear it?

325
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:34,893
Please sing for us.

326
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:36,994
- Please.
- We'd love to hear it.

327
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,534
Please.

328
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:47,834
I'm sorry. I haven't fully
recovered my voice yet.

329
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:05,084
I can't let Oh Yoon Hee
keep pushing me around.

330
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,254
Find something on her.

331
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,254
Search her house, put a
tail on her, or whatever.

332
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,963
I want something that can
back her into a corner.

333
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:21,233
Why don't you postpone the
alumni reunion tonight?

334
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:24,504
You don't seem so well.

335
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:30,544
It was going to be my treat to
thank them for coming to my concert.

336
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:41,693
Hi, it's me.

337
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:44,423
I'm so sorry.

338
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,463
I can't make it tonight
because I'm not feeling well.

339
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:52,403
I'll talk to the chef so
you can dine without me.

340
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,673
What are you talking about?

341
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,913
Why would she show up there?

342
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:13,623
We'll let you know as soon as
the new product is released.

343
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:14,923
Chairman Joo.

344
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:16,923
You may leave.

345
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:19,893
Hello, I'm assemblyman
Lee Kyu Jin of Gangnam.

346
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:22,094
I'm assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin of Gangnam.

347
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,933
Considering their reaction, I
guess they don't live in Gangnam.

348
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:30,133
Anyway, with your furniture
business taking off,

349
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:31,804
you seem very busy.

350
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,873
I was just about to leave.
What brings you here?

351
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,344
Gosh, that chair looks amazing.

352
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:44,114
I was nearby and thought I should stop by.

353
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:45,683
Partly that,

354
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,554
and my fingers were getting itchy.

355
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:51,693
Aren't you tired of playing with me alone?

356
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,564
Also, I win your money all the time anyway.

357
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,364
I feel bad.

358
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:03,703
That's why I'm thinking of
bringing in a pushover today.

359
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,203
Do you know anyone?

360
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:17,014
Thanks for letting me join.

361
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:19,584
We haven't done this in a while.

362
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:23,193
Now it feels real that I'm back in Hera Club.

363
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:27,824
By the way, you brought a
beautiful lady with you.

364
00:25:28,264 --> 00:25:31,764
Oh, I ran into her when I just left home,

365
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,034
and she wanted to tag along.

366
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:36,403
To make sure the game is fair,
I'll be your dealer today.

367
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:40,004
Is it okay if we raise the stakes? No limit.

368
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:42,344
- Sure.
- Of course.

369
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:52,423
Dr. Ha.

370
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,794
Ten more.

371
00:26:02,034 --> 00:26:04,494
Mr. Lee, are you taking all my money away?

372
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:06,903
If you're scared, quit.

373
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:08,304
- Call.
- Call.

374
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:14,844
Oh, my.

375
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:18,244
- Gosh.
- What's wrong?

376
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,544
I'm out.

377
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,913
- Do you want to continue?
- Why not?

378
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:26,554
Dr. Ha, you've become quite bold
since you started your business.

379
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,123
This is the first round,
and I admire your spirit,

380
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:30,594
but too bad.

381
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,594
Flush.

382
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,534
Sorry, I win.

383
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:48,713
My cards are better.

384
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,123
- That was amazing.
- You're right.

385
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:02,453
- It's delicious.
- Look at you!

386
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,594
- I thought you couldn't make it.
- Welcome.

387
00:27:04,594 --> 00:27:06,494
I was sad because I thought we
wouldn't be able to see you.

388
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:07,623
Did you catch a cold?

389
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,433
I guess I overworked myself.

390
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:13,004
I feel better now that
I've taken some medicine.

391
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,334
The seat is taken.

392
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:16,903
By who?

393
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,034
Hey.

394
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:21,614
You're late.

395
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:26,114
I can join you guys, right?

396
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:28,114
I know I wasn't invited,

397
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,784
but I wanted to come to congratulate you.

398
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:31,014
This is...

399
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:34,054
the Seoul University of Music alumni reunion.

400
00:27:34,923 --> 00:27:37,094
Isn't it a little uncomfortable for you?

401
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:38,994
Come on. Don't say that.

402
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:41,294
Yoon Hee is also a Cheong
A Arts High School alumni.

403
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:43,433
Apparently, she went to watch
your performance last night too.

404
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:46,233
She deserves to be here, no?

405
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,663
- Of course.
- Have a seat.

406
00:27:47,663 --> 00:27:49,173
- Nice of you to join us.
- Come here.

407
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:53,744
- Cheers.
- All right.

408
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:57,314
I was surprised by Seo
Jin's singing last night.

409
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:58,814
It was the best.

410
00:27:58,814 --> 00:28:01,754
Yoon Hee was better in school.

411
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:04,084
You remember the Cheong
A Art Festival, right?

412
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,254
I got goosebumps...

413
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:07,054
because I was reminded
of Yoon Hee last night.

414
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:08,893
You too?

415
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:11,453
When Seo Jin hit the high F,

416
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:13,064
I thought it sounded just like Yoon Hee.

417
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:15,364
Had it not been for that incident,

418
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:18,304
Yoon Hee would've certainly made
it to Seoul University of Music.

419
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,004
She was the top-class
at Cheong A Arts School,

420
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:22,604
and won the grand prize at every competition.

421
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:26,203
That's all history.

422
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:27,973
I don't even sing anymore.

423
00:28:28,614 --> 00:28:31,913
Seo Jin, you really aren't feeling well.

424
00:28:31,913 --> 00:28:33,643
You're not even drinking.

425
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:34,643
Are you okay?

426
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:39,024
Right. You all know too, right?

427
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:40,623
The Hera Place incident.

428
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:44,594
Yoon Hee had quite the
life in the last few years.

429
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:47,094
From murder charges to running away.

430
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:50,693
It's nice to see you be free...

431
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:51,804
at last.

432
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,004
Why are you bringing that up now?

433
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:56,203
Why? Does it make you uncomfortable?

434
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:58,744
You joined us because you're
fine with all of that now, right?

435
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:00,574
You're right.

436
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:02,873
I was falsely accused,

437
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,814
but I've been proven innocent.

438
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:07,114
I'm as happy as can be now.

439
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,953
I'm a little shy to say,

440
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,883
but I got married again.

441
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:15,623
- Really?
- No way!

442
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:18,123
- Really?
- To who?

443
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,564
- When?
- Girl!

444
00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:21,223
What does your husband do?

445
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:23,094
He's a businessman.

446
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,864
You wouldn't know him even
if I said the company's name.

447
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,104
It's called JohnBIO.

448
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:28,304
I know that company!

449
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:30,173
It's a huge hit in the US.

450
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:31,703
- Really?
- No way.

451
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,004
What business is it?

452
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:35,473
I'm going to the bathroom.

453
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,844
Stop looking him up. I'm embarrassed.

454
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:39,643
I can't believe you got remarried.

455
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,153
This man is Seo Jin's ex-husband.

456
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:47,054
He was a neurosurgeon at
Cheong A Medical Center.

457
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:49,554
- You're right.
- Really?

458
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,864
Did you get remarried
to Seo Jin's ex-husband?

459
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:54,264
Yes, it just happened.

460
00:30:10,913 --> 00:30:12,044
Oh Yoon Hee...

461
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,754
I'll kill you.

462
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,324
It's so good to see you.

463
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:27,193
Tell us the truth since Seo Jin isn't here.

464
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,233
Back then,

465
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:31,264
did you really stab yourself in the neck?

466
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:34,064
It was just Seo Jin and you in the room.

467
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:36,834
We couldn't say anything back then,

468
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,403
but nobody believed it.

469
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:42,274
We all thought that Seo Jin stabbed you.

470
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:43,913
Tell us already.

471
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,913
What's the truth?

472
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:57,494
Come on.

473
00:30:57,494 --> 00:30:59,223
Ask Seo Jin yourself.

474
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:00,923
She knows the truth too.

475
00:31:00,923 --> 00:31:03,594
- Come on!
- Just tell us.

476
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:05,903
- Why can't you tell us?
- Tell us.

477
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,673
You're hilarious.

478
00:31:10,673 --> 00:31:12,504
Come on.

479
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,614
Mr. Ha, what a game.

480
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:18,213
Unbelievable.

481
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,344
Is it not Player Joo's day today?

482
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,814
Would you please shut it?

483
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,453
I can't focus!

484
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:26,554
He's taking the anger out on us.

485
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:29,193
I hear one's real personality
comes out when they lose money.

486
00:31:29,193 --> 00:31:30,794
This proves that right.

487
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,264
Should we stop here?

488
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:35,133
You've lost almost all of it.

489
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:37,294
Who do you think you are,
just ending the game whenever?

490
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:41,973
Let's go big one last round.

491
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:43,903
Can you be all in?

492
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,044
If not,

493
00:31:48,104 --> 00:31:49,173
we can stop here.

494
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,814
I don't mind.

495
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:52,314
All right, then.

496
00:31:55,284 --> 00:31:57,483
You're so cool, Ha Yoon Chul!

497
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:00,354
Let's play one last round with everything in.

498
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:01,623
Sure.

499
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,824
These four cards are very important.

500
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:09,764
- I'm nervous.
- Same here.

501
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,403
Finding the right timing
to die is the key to poker,

502
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:17,774
just like in life,

503
00:32:17,774 --> 00:32:19,104
you must die before you're 50 to remarry.

504
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:21,574
KYU JIN'S

505
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:23,814
The person you have reached is unavailable.

506
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:26,814
Is he drinking out somewhere again?

507
00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:31,453
His wife is working her bones off...

508
00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:34,084
to volunteer in his district all day long,

509
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:39,663
but he's out there, living his best life.

510
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:41,963
I can't believe he's an assemblyman.

511
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:45,764
That's why our country is like this.

512
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:54,004
It's hard to read their faces.

513
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:04,383
What was that?

514
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:07,623
- What a game!
- Oh, my.

515
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:10,893
Chairman Joo, I'm sorry.

516
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,494
It's four Aces.

517
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:17,334
No way.

518
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,074
Oh, my.

519
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:25,473
Mr. Ha, did you only play
poker when you were in the US?

520
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:26,703
You're like a hoodwinker now.

521
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:29,713
I just got lucky. It's beginner's luck.

522
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:33,213
Chairman Joo, how much have you lost today?

523
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,854
A million dollars?

524
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,114
Let's play again sometime.

525
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:40,423
I won't go easy on you next time.

526
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:41,423
Thanks.

527
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,324
"Go easy"?

528
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,864
I saw you use your full brain power.

529
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,163
Bye!

530
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,604
Mr. Ha, you have to treat us big time.

531
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:58,774
No, not today. It's time
for my wife to come back.

532
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:00,173
Next time.

533
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:02,074
Just let me off this time.

534
00:34:02,514 --> 00:34:04,244
Come on!

535
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:08,784
I can't sleep well...

536
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,853
if I drink just a little like this.

537
00:34:10,853 --> 00:34:13,583
What's there to worry about?

538
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:16,193
You can drink with me.

539
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:19,864
Just us two?

540
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:23,764
What are you saying?

541
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:25,864
That's not fun.

542
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:30,034
Do you not remember things...

543
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,903
when you get drunk?

544
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:37,644
No, I remember everything just fine.

545
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,344
Then do you remember?

546
00:34:41,014 --> 00:34:44,313
You and I recently, you know,

547
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,023
did things.

548
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:55,434
What? What are you saying?

549
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:58,903
Are you serious?

550
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,003
You were the one who started.
Why are you acting innocent?

551
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:04,333
Do you not remember or what?

552
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,844
What did I do?

553
00:35:05,844 --> 00:35:08,103
Why do you keep saying that?

554
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:21,923
You remember now, don't you?

555
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:25,523
Oh, my.

556
00:35:57,062 --> 00:35:59,803
What are you trying to
do? What are you plotting?

557
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,062
Are you trying to kill me with anxiety?

558
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:07,803
Why are you so scared, Cheon Seo Jin?

559
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:09,543
That's not like you.

560
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:11,672
Relax.

561
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:15,443
I haven't even started yet.

562
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:21,022
I know you're in a rush, so
you're just coming at me,

563
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:24,352
but you're so pathetic that I feel bad.

564
00:36:29,122 --> 00:36:30,792
The more you do this,

565
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:33,563
the more I'm itching to expose you.

566
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:36,673
You want me to expose you?

567
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:40,503
And tell the world that your singing is fake?

568
00:36:41,173 --> 00:36:43,343
That the one who made it a
successful performance was...

569
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:46,643
me, Oh Yoon Hee?

570
00:36:50,012 --> 00:36:51,912
Tell me what you want.

571
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:55,923
Tell me exactly what you want from me.

572
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,072
Retire.

573
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:14,003
- What?
- Retire.

574
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:16,173
You've stepped on others,

575
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:18,313
stole others' opportunities,

576
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:23,012
and got there by faking. So,
let that all go yourself.

577
00:37:25,182 --> 00:37:27,883
Aren't you ashamed to be called...

578
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:30,953
the best soprano of the time?

579
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:38,032
I didn't get here by faking.

580
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,002
I tried with all my life to get here.

581
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:42,062
But you got off on the wrong foot.

582
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:44,472
You cut my throat...

583
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:47,673
and crushed my dreams.

584
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:50,643
But you didn't get punished.

585
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:54,013
So, everything you have right now...

586
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:55,913
is fake.

587
00:37:57,953 --> 00:38:00,423
Cancel all of your planned performances.

588
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:02,883
Hold a press conference...

589
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:05,453
and tell the world that
you can't sing anymore.

590
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:09,793
Then, I'll keep it a secret...

591
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,133
that I was your shadow singer.

592
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,462
How does that sound?

593
00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:18,103
It sounds like a generous deal to me.

594
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:24,073
Singing is my life.

595
00:38:24,712 --> 00:38:26,413
It was...

596
00:38:27,413 --> 00:38:29,083
also my life.

597
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,483
Oh Yoon Hee!

598
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:32,752
How does this Saturday sound...

599
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,553
for the press conference?

600
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:39,353
That's the press conference
day for your opera.

601
00:38:39,893 --> 00:38:42,263
There will be lots of domestic
and international reporters.

602
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:44,393
Won't that be a good day for it?

603
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:54,543
All right. Go as far as you'd like.

604
00:38:55,103 --> 00:38:57,212
I won't beg you.

605
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,913
Don't you underestimate me.

606
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:07,522
I'm different from Su Ryeon.

607
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:10,853
You should go and think...

608
00:39:11,522 --> 00:39:14,663
about how much you'll lose
and how your downfall will go.

609
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:23,303
Does your daughter know?

610
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:26,803
That you're going around, being like this?

611
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:30,673
Didn't your daughter leave you...

612
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:33,983
because she's mortified by this side of you?

613
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:38,413
And that's why you came back
here on your own, right?

614
00:39:46,723 --> 00:39:49,163
Shouldn't you worry about
your daughter first?

615
00:39:51,762 --> 00:39:53,502
My plan includes...

616
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:58,502
your daughter too.

617
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:09,043
Don't you lay a finger on my daughter.

618
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:12,713
Not Eun Byeol!

619
00:40:13,483 --> 00:40:16,692
Oh Yoon Hee!

620
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:21,992
Oh Yoon Hee!

621
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:36,872
How was the dinner tonight?

622
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,213
It was okay.

623
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:41,312
Would you like a cocktail at the lounge?

624
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:44,483
I'm exhausted. With the
fan meet and interviews,

625
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:46,053
I'm completely beat.

626
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:50,023
Come on.

627
00:40:56,932 --> 00:41:00,332
I'll take care of Oh Yoon Hee.

628
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:03,702
Hera Palace is mine and
I sell it to who I want.

629
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:06,173
I have that much power.

630
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:16,343
Don't bother her. Don't anger her!

631
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:19,283
What do you mean?

632
00:41:19,283 --> 00:41:21,023
At least for a little while.

633
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:25,553
Just let her be.

634
00:41:55,053 --> 00:41:56,483
What could it be?

635
00:41:57,492 --> 00:41:59,752
What does Cheon Seo Jin have...

636
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,093
to be afraid of Oh Yoon Hee?

637
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:18,372
It's me, Joo Dan Tae. Can we meet?

638
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:25,082
Did something happen to Director?

639
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:28,653
That's what I'd like to ask.

640
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:30,353
Secretary Do,

641
00:42:30,892 --> 00:42:34,663
what have you done that
things are looking this messy?

642
00:42:35,223 --> 00:42:37,463
You've caused this big of an accident,

643
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:39,132
and left Director to clean up on her own?

644
00:42:39,132 --> 00:42:43,033
Can you really call yourself
her manager after this?

645
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:47,002
I don't know what you're saying.

646
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:48,843
What happened with Oh Yoon Hee.

647
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,242
I've heard it all from Director Cheon.

648
00:42:56,213 --> 00:42:59,082
Until when were you planning
on hiding it from me?

649
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:02,952
If that broke out,

650
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:06,423
didn't you think that it'd break her career?

651
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:10,363
She was threatened just now...

652
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:12,392
by Oh Yoon Hee.

653
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:15,163
If the woman I'm marrying
is going through this,

654
00:43:15,163 --> 00:43:17,303
I should've been the first to know.

655
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,733
Why didn't you say anything?

656
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:22,343
Secretary Do!

657
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:28,713
It's all my fault.

658
00:43:29,913 --> 00:43:32,053
When Director Cheon had vocal cord nodules,

659
00:43:32,053 --> 00:43:34,182
I should've made her cancel her performance.

660
00:43:34,182 --> 00:43:36,853
She obviously would've
wanted to go forward with it.

661
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:39,593
I must've been fooled by the broker.

662
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:41,992
I was very secretive when I
looked for the replacement singer,

663
00:43:42,593 --> 00:43:45,632
and I had no idea that
Oh Yoon Hee could sing.

664
00:43:46,803 --> 00:43:48,562
I checked over and over again,

665
00:43:48,632 --> 00:43:51,033
but she completely masked her identity.

666
00:43:52,803 --> 00:43:54,342
I'm so sorry, Chairman.

667
00:43:57,842 --> 00:43:59,112
You're saying,

668
00:44:00,743 --> 00:44:02,643
Oh Yoon Hee sang...

669
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:05,712
for Cheon Seo Jin at her performance?

670
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:18,293
This is amusing.

671
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:22,033
You didn't know?

672
00:44:23,572 --> 00:44:25,303
You said you knew everything...

673
00:44:29,403 --> 00:44:30,543
Did you...

674
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:35,212
It's time for you to choose now.

675
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:39,212
Will you join me now? Or...

676
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:41,283
will you get fired by Seo Jin...

677
00:44:42,023 --> 00:44:44,023
for running your mouth recklessly?

678
00:45:22,123 --> 00:45:24,633
What are you doing? You startled me.

679
00:45:25,393 --> 00:45:27,033
Why are you here at this hour?

680
00:45:28,202 --> 00:45:29,533
I was going to give you a wake-up call,

681
00:45:29,962 --> 00:45:31,633
but I wanted to see you sleeping.

682
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:34,442
How about breakfast?

683
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:37,913
Don't do that again.

684
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:40,942
I was tossing and turning all
night and barely fell asleep.

685
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:44,653
You're too irritable.

686
00:45:45,413 --> 00:45:47,822
The concert went well, and
many good things are happening.

687
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:51,653
Do you have a concern
that I don't know about...

688
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:53,663
or something?

689
00:45:55,423 --> 00:45:56,862
A concern? Of course, not.

690
00:45:58,663 --> 00:45:59,862
I'll wash up and come out.

691
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,663
Have some coffee and wait for me.

692
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:16,283
Oh Yoon Hee. She really is impressive.

693
00:46:16,913 --> 00:46:18,283
If I can use her properly,

694
00:46:18,283 --> 00:46:20,923
she'll be useful in taming Seo Jin.

695
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:30,893
What are you doing?

696
00:46:31,562 --> 00:46:32,633
Isn't it obvious?

697
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:39,072
Can't you have breakfast at your penthouse?

698
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:40,442
I'm a high school senior.

699
00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:42,903
It hurts my studies if I'm in a bad mood.

700
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:45,013
Please stop talking. You're
making me lose my appetite.

701
00:46:45,373 --> 00:46:46,513
What?

702
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:48,143
You said I didn't need to try.

703
00:46:48,643 --> 00:46:50,852
So I'm going to drop the act.

704
00:46:50,852 --> 00:46:53,383
I hate doing things that are inefficient.

705
00:46:54,623 --> 00:46:55,852
I can't stand you.

706
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:19,942
I love this place.

707
00:47:21,243 --> 00:47:24,053
I made lots of friends at school today.

708
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:26,513
I have you with me...

709
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:27,852
and I'm getting used to the school.

710
00:47:28,123 --> 00:47:30,182
I'm so happy, I could die.

711
00:47:34,092 --> 00:47:35,092
Ro Na.

712
00:47:36,862 --> 00:47:40,293
I need to tell you something.

713
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:42,133
What is it? You're making me nervous.

714
00:47:43,503 --> 00:47:45,972
Just spit it out. Stop scaring me.

715
00:47:47,803 --> 00:47:48,873
I have to go...

716
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:51,743
to Korea.

717
00:47:52,013 --> 00:47:53,013
Why?

718
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:55,283
I can't live happily with you...

719
00:47:56,682 --> 00:47:58,653
like nothing happened.

720
00:48:00,852 --> 00:48:01,883
I...

721
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:06,253
I feel like I can't breathe.

722
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:10,362
I feel so guilty toward Su Ryeon.

723
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,332
You didn't kill her.

724
00:48:12,332 --> 00:48:13,862
So why do you feel guilty?

725
00:48:14,303 --> 00:48:15,462
I don't understand.

726
00:48:16,803 --> 00:48:18,173
Still, I have to go.

727
00:48:18,432 --> 00:48:20,643
I know I shouldn't do this to you,

728
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:22,842
but I have to go.

729
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:26,942
No, Mom.

730
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:28,982
Just live here with me.

731
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,612
Let's forget everything
that happened in Korea.

732
00:48:31,612 --> 00:48:33,182
I'll pray...

733
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,952
that Ms. Shim and her daughter will meet...

734
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:38,253
and live happily together in their next life.

735
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:39,553
So please, don't go.

736
00:48:39,993 --> 00:48:41,192
I...

737
00:48:45,263 --> 00:48:46,932
killed that girl.

738
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,133
What?

739
00:48:49,732 --> 00:48:52,202
I did that to Min Seol A,

740
00:48:54,572 --> 00:48:56,903
Su Ryeon's daughter.

741
00:48:58,673 --> 00:49:00,143
I'm sorry.

742
00:49:03,753 --> 00:49:04,982
Liar.

743
00:49:07,082 --> 00:49:08,283
Why are you lying?

744
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:11,692
You would never.

745
00:49:13,722 --> 00:49:15,423
I'll pay...

746
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,763
for what I did.

747
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:21,263
Did you do it on purpose?

748
00:49:21,702 --> 00:49:22,862
Because of me?

749
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:25,572
To get me into Cheong A?

750
00:49:25,572 --> 00:49:28,803
No. It was definitely not on purpose.

751
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:30,572
How could you kill her...

752
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,543
and move into her home...

753
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:34,982
and be happy that it went up in value?

754
00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:37,013
You're a monster.

755
00:49:37,013 --> 00:49:39,253
You're scary! You make me
sick! You give me chills!

756
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:41,182
I really didn't remember
anything at the time.

757
00:49:41,182 --> 00:49:43,653
It's true, Ro Na. Please believe me.

758
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:45,322
Stop it!

759
00:49:45,993 --> 00:49:47,962
You're saying you killed her.

760
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:50,423
You killed Min Seol A because of me!

761
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:52,432
You're saying my mom is a murderer!

762
00:49:52,432 --> 00:49:54,602
No. It wasn't because of you.

763
00:49:54,602 --> 00:49:56,432
It was definitely not because of you.

764
00:49:56,903 --> 00:49:58,673
This is all me.

765
00:49:58,673 --> 00:50:00,003
You had nothing to do with it.

766
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:02,202
So please, don't blame yourself.

767
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:03,572
Why did you tell me?

768
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:06,513
You should've kept it a secret forever.

769
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:09,712
What am I supposed to do?

770
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:12,452
How am I supposed to live with this guilt?

771
00:50:14,082 --> 00:50:16,283
Ro Na. Ro Na!

772
00:50:28,062 --> 00:50:30,033
Don't forgive me.

773
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:33,273
Hate me and resent me forever.

774
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:40,472
Did you confess to your daughter...

775
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:46,452
that you killed Seol A?

776
00:50:52,523 --> 00:50:54,663
This is the last favor I'll ask of you.

777
00:50:56,393 --> 00:50:57,493
Please make sure...

778
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:02,062
Ro Na never goes back to Korea.

779
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:05,832
If you do that...

780
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:13,273
I'll do anything you want.

781
00:51:14,212 --> 00:51:15,783
Don't worry about Ro Na.

782
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,253
I'll keep her with me.

783
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:28,623
You can't come here, Ro Na.

784
00:51:30,263 --> 00:51:34,332
Not until I destroy those evil people.

785
00:51:47,283 --> 00:51:49,942
Are you preparing for the press conference?

786
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,952
Don't forget. It's this Saturday.

787
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:54,153
You crazy little...

788
00:52:08,832 --> 00:52:09,832
Come in.

789
00:52:15,273 --> 00:52:16,803
How have you been?

790
00:52:31,422 --> 00:52:34,723
It's been two years now.

791
00:52:37,193 --> 00:52:38,293
Why...

792
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:42,433
are you...

793
00:52:47,273 --> 00:52:48,342
Re-enroll?

794
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:51,672
Did you just say "re-enroll"?

795
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:56,283
Yes. I came because I want
to re-enroll at Cheong A.

796
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:00,352
Sorry, but that's impossible.

797
00:53:02,553 --> 00:53:04,652
There's no opening.

798
00:53:05,193 --> 00:53:08,763
And I have no desire to go
out of our way to accept you.

799
00:53:09,763 --> 00:53:10,993
Does that answer your question?

800
00:53:10,993 --> 00:53:13,162
I knew you'd say that.

801
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:18,102
But you'll have to admit me.

802
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:22,572
Are you doing this...

803
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:26,043
because you think you can rely on your mom?

804
00:53:49,402 --> 00:53:52,203
- Oh my gosh. Gosh.
- Is it good?

805
00:53:52,203 --> 00:53:54,943
You look the prettiest
when you're drinking soda.

806
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:57,273
Drink faster.

807
00:53:57,273 --> 00:53:58,273
Seok Kyung.

808
00:54:05,183 --> 00:54:06,312
Cut it out already.

809
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:07,582
Stay out of it, Seok Hoon.

810
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:11,352
She's drinking it voluntarily
because she's thirsty.

811
00:54:11,352 --> 00:54:13,152
Stay out of it.

812
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:17,062
I said, cut it out.

813
00:54:19,062 --> 00:54:20,162
Me?

814
00:54:20,332 --> 00:54:23,132
I'm not the Min Hyuk you used to know.

815
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:25,473
How dare you?

816
00:54:34,243 --> 00:54:36,983
You guys haven't changed a bit.

817
00:54:39,382 --> 00:54:40,683
Bae Ro Na?

818
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,693
Gosh, seriously.

819
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:49,862
Jenny, are you okay?

820
00:54:50,592 --> 00:54:53,662
Hey, how dare you show up at our school?

821
00:54:53,662 --> 00:54:55,602
You guys haven't quit this yet?

822
00:54:55,763 --> 00:54:57,973
How can you still be the
same after what happened?

823
00:54:57,973 --> 00:55:00,402
What is she saying?

824
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:07,842
Guys, I think I broke my arm.

825
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:10,713
I broke my arm!

826
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:12,513
That hurts!

827
00:55:13,912 --> 00:55:17,523
Bae Ro Na won first prize at
the Elizabeth Competition?

828
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:19,652
According to our school rules,

829
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:22,922
an international competition
winner is allowed to re-enroll.

830
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:25,263
This is hot news.

831
00:55:26,132 --> 00:55:28,632
Isn't she the country's
youngest winner so far?

832
00:55:28,632 --> 00:55:31,632
- I should ask the PR team to...
- Do you think...

833
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:35,473
I called you here to ask you to do that?

834
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:37,473
Pardon?

835
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:42,213
I need the head of the
art department to step in.

836
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,253
While studying here,

837
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:47,283
Bae Ro Na got in a lot of trouble.

838
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:53,023
If she re-enroll, she
might distract the seniors.

839
00:55:53,023 --> 00:55:55,963
Don't you think she'll raise an issue?

840
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:59,493
The school rules clearly
state that she may re-enroll.

841
00:56:00,763 --> 00:56:04,003
But we can't let Bae Ro Na come back here.

842
00:56:04,172 --> 00:56:05,773
Find a way.

843
00:56:05,773 --> 00:56:08,043
Can't you do that much as the
head of the art department?

844
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:20,713
Hello, Ms. Ko.

845
00:56:22,652 --> 00:56:23,983
An accident?

846
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:37,602
Where's Ro Na?

847
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,832
Don't tell me...

848
00:56:39,872 --> 00:56:41,872
you're here as Ro Na's guardian.

849
00:56:42,743 --> 00:56:44,872
Did you forget that Eun
Byeol goes to this school?

850
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:46,443
What if she sees you?

851
00:56:46,443 --> 00:56:49,043
Stop picking a fight. Just
explain what happened.

852
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:53,283
I already told you everything on the phone.

853
00:56:53,783 --> 00:56:56,622
Ro Na kicked Min Hyuk to the ground,

854
00:56:56,852 --> 00:56:58,592
and Min Hyuk ended up in the ER.

855
00:56:58,592 --> 00:57:00,152
Cheong A Medical Center, right?

856
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:01,592
I'll go there.

857
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:04,592
I'll call you when I know how
he is. Don't worry too much.

858
00:57:04,763 --> 00:57:06,362
Make sure Ro Na is okay.

859
00:57:09,832 --> 00:57:11,973
Was Ro Na really here?

860
00:57:12,372 --> 00:57:14,132
Why?

861
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,912
You really don't know?

862
00:57:19,572 --> 00:57:22,513
She came with a prize from
international competition,

863
00:57:22,513 --> 00:57:25,253
asking to be re-admitted.

864
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,483
I thought you sent her.

865
00:57:27,553 --> 00:57:29,152
She did?

866
00:57:33,652 --> 00:57:35,122
Where is she now?

867
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:38,132
As you may guess, because
of this violent incident,

868
00:57:38,132 --> 00:57:40,062
she won't be able to re-enter the school.

869
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:43,362
Since she isn't our student, she
won't be disciplined by the school,

870
00:57:44,102 --> 00:57:47,203
she's likely to be
investigated by the police.

871
00:57:50,273 --> 00:57:53,513
Explain what happened so I can understand.

872
00:57:54,112 --> 00:57:57,142
Bae Ro Na popped out of
nowhere and kicked Min Hyuk.

873
00:57:57,142 --> 00:57:59,213
Jenny threw up from the shock.

874
00:58:00,082 --> 00:58:01,723
- You all saw that, right?
- Yes.

875
00:58:01,723 --> 00:58:04,253
- I saw it.
- I saw it too.

876
00:58:04,253 --> 00:58:06,053
She's extremely strong.

877
00:58:06,392 --> 00:58:07,963
I didn't do that.

878
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:10,622
They're lying.

879
00:58:13,263 --> 00:58:15,902
You guys were bullying Jenny.

880
00:58:16,132 --> 00:58:17,533
Why are you leaving that out?

881
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:19,402
They were bullying Jenny?

882
00:58:19,602 --> 00:58:22,443
But they're our school's model students.

883
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:26,342
Jenny, you tell me.

884
00:58:26,412 --> 00:58:28,543
Did they bully you?

885
00:58:36,753 --> 00:58:37,892
No.

886
00:58:38,793 --> 00:58:40,822
We were just fooling around.

887
00:58:40,822 --> 00:58:43,122
Jenny, how could you...

888
00:58:48,632 --> 00:58:50,033
Ro Na!

889
00:58:58,043 --> 00:58:59,743
Are you out of your mind?

890
00:59:00,572 --> 00:59:01,912
Why are you back here?

891
00:59:01,912 --> 00:59:04,213
Why would you come back
to this horrible place?

892
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:07,312
I want to graduate.

893
00:59:07,822 --> 00:59:10,622
I also want the Cheong A Art
Festival grand prize trophy.

894
00:59:10,622 --> 00:59:13,223
I don't need any of that. Go back right now.

895
00:59:13,493 --> 00:59:15,493
I don't care about Seoul National
University, the grand prize,

896
00:59:15,693 --> 00:59:17,592
or something even better.

897
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:19,993
I don't care. I mean it.

898
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:22,803
Do you think I sing because of you?

899
00:59:23,162 --> 00:59:24,162
What?

900
00:59:24,162 --> 00:59:26,602
I'm not trying to win the
grand prize because of you.

901
00:59:27,132 --> 00:59:29,943
It's for me. I'm doing it for myself.

902
00:59:30,172 --> 00:59:32,243
I want to go back to
Cheong A Arts High School.

903
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:35,142
And I'm going to enter Cheong A Art Festival.

904
00:59:35,543 --> 00:59:36,882
I have to.

905
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:39,213
Why? Why do you have to?

906
00:59:40,053 --> 00:59:41,352
No.

907
00:59:42,523 --> 00:59:45,852
Please go back to the US, okay?

908
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:47,652
Haven't you been through enough?

909
00:59:47,652 --> 00:59:50,263
Who knows what they'll do to you?

910
00:59:50,993 --> 00:59:53,263
Are you scared that I'll be bullied?

911
00:59:55,602 --> 00:59:59,132
You're always so selfish.

912
01:00:02,572 --> 01:00:04,572
Now that you know I'm alive,

913
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:06,112
can I go?

914
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:11,713
Ro Na!

915
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:29,303
Do you think this can put things right?

916
01:00:29,303 --> 01:00:32,132
My boy broke his arm!

917
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:35,872
His iron arm!

918
01:00:35,872 --> 01:00:38,672
How can Ro Na be so strong?

919
01:00:38,672 --> 01:00:41,213
I am a cultured woman,

920
01:00:41,213 --> 01:00:43,912
but no one can stop me
when it comes to my boy!

921
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:47,412
Anyway, how are you going to
take responsibility for this?

922
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:49,183
My mom is filing a suit.

923
01:00:49,183 --> 01:00:51,053
She's so upset that she's refusing to eat.

924
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:53,453
An assemblyman's son...

925
01:00:53,453 --> 01:00:56,523
was bullied at school!
How can this be possible?

926
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:58,562
The doctor said he doesn't
need to wear a cast,

927
01:00:58,562 --> 01:01:00,832
but you insisted on it.

928
01:01:01,963 --> 01:01:05,503
We're neighbors. Give us a little break.

929
01:01:05,832 --> 01:01:09,602
Mr. Ha! I'm disappointed in you.

930
01:01:09,602 --> 01:01:12,473
Just because you're successful
doesn't mean you can be shameless!

931
01:01:13,243 --> 01:01:14,812
I'm not going to...

932
01:01:15,443 --> 01:01:18,053
let this slide.

933
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:20,683
Let's deal with it legally.

934
01:01:21,283 --> 01:01:24,322
We're not going to settle or go easy on you.

935
01:01:24,693 --> 01:01:28,092
Then again, she's a murderer's daughter.

936
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:30,822
She's so used to violence.

937
01:01:30,822 --> 01:01:32,632
Come on. Hit me too.

938
01:01:32,632 --> 01:01:35,203
Don't talk that way about
my wife and daughter!

939
01:01:39,132 --> 01:01:41,703
Since you've been an attorney,
you must know that...

940
01:01:41,703 --> 01:01:45,013
what you just said counts as defamation.

941
01:01:45,812 --> 01:01:48,283
Say anything like that again,

942
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:50,543
I'll rip your mouth out.

943
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:53,312
Hey.

944
01:01:55,723 --> 01:01:57,183
It's not like...

945
01:01:58,023 --> 01:02:01,763
she's your first wife and
Ro Na is your real daughter.

946
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:20,743
Right.

947
01:02:21,713 --> 01:02:24,043
This might be my chance.

948
01:02:27,852 --> 01:02:31,122
Ro Na might be able to protect me.

949
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:40,463
Hello? Who...

950
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,203
Ro Na?

951
01:02:56,142 --> 01:02:58,582
Ro Na, what are you doing here?

952
01:02:58,582 --> 01:03:00,412
Your daughter showed up out of nowhere...

953
01:03:00,412 --> 01:03:03,053
and is begging me to
re-admit her to the school.

954
01:03:03,652 --> 01:03:05,953
Get up. Get up right now!

955
01:03:09,092 --> 01:03:11,933
I won't cause any trouble at school.

956
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:13,263
I promise.

957
01:03:13,263 --> 01:03:16,533
If anything happens, I'll pay for it.

958
01:03:16,862 --> 01:03:19,872
So please let me come back.

959
01:03:19,872 --> 01:03:22,342
I want to graduate from
Cheong A Arts High School.

960
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:23,703
I beg you.

961
01:03:23,703 --> 01:03:25,473
What are you talking about?

962
01:03:25,473 --> 01:03:28,142
- Why would you beg for that?
- Let go.

963
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:30,082
This is none of your business.

964
01:03:31,753 --> 01:03:34,152
You used to be my student.

965
01:03:34,152 --> 01:03:36,683
Seeing you beg so desperately, I feel bad.

966
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:38,392
I'll do think about it.

967
01:03:39,122 --> 01:03:40,322
On one condition.

968
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:44,293
Bring me a written promise
from your mom that...

969
01:03:44,293 --> 01:03:47,263
she won't cause any trouble and
will cooperate with the school.

970
01:03:47,933 --> 01:03:49,832
Otherwise, I can't trust her.

971
01:03:49,832 --> 01:03:51,473
I can do that.

972
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:55,003
- I'll take care of it.
- Ro Na, how could you...

973
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:57,602
Fine. You may leave.

974
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:10,882
What are you doing?

975
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:13,122
Ro Na will not attend Cheong A.

976
01:04:13,122 --> 01:04:14,493
I won't allow it.

977
01:04:14,493 --> 01:04:16,493
I thought you'd be very grateful.

978
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:17,562
I'm surprised.

979
01:04:17,862 --> 01:04:18,993
Why is that?

980
01:04:19,533 --> 01:04:21,362
I don't want her to go.

981
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:23,862
Whether or not you want it,

982
01:04:23,862 --> 01:04:27,072
as the director, I'll decide
according to school policy.

983
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:30,243
I don't want people to accuse me
of keeping your daughter out...

984
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:32,572
because of my ill feelings toward you.

985
01:04:33,072 --> 01:04:34,372
I'm an educator after all.

986
01:04:37,243 --> 01:04:38,412
An educator?

987
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:40,783
You must be trying to cut a deal...

988
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:43,382
using Ro Na...

989
01:04:43,382 --> 01:04:44,582
I think...

990
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:50,922
we should bury that now.

991
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:54,362
If you want Min Hyuk's issue
to be resolved favorably.

992
01:04:55,162 --> 01:04:57,562
If word gets out that she
assaulted an assemblyman's son,

993
01:04:57,562 --> 01:05:00,303
it'll be a stumbling block for
her. Is that what you want?

994
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:02,743
Even if you want her to go
back to school in the US,

995
01:05:02,743 --> 01:05:05,043
you should make sure she doesn't
have a prior for assault.

996
01:05:05,842 --> 01:05:07,172
You conniving witch.

997
01:05:07,943 --> 01:05:11,412
Do you think you can make
it go away just like that?

998
01:05:11,412 --> 01:05:14,652
What do you gain by hurting my reputation?

999
01:05:16,082 --> 01:05:18,152
Do you not care if you
destroy Ro Na's life...

1000
01:05:18,152 --> 01:05:19,622
just to get me?

1001
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:22,023
If you do anything to her,

1002
01:05:22,993 --> 01:05:25,293
I will make you regret it.

1003
01:05:25,293 --> 01:05:26,392
That...

1004
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:35,473
depends on you now.

1005
01:05:52,023 --> 01:05:55,523
Ro Na. Why are you doing this to me?

1006
01:05:55,862 --> 01:05:58,332
Please, go back to the US. Please.

1007
01:05:58,332 --> 01:05:59,433
Do you want me...

1008
01:06:00,062 --> 01:06:02,562
to hide somewhere you can never find me?

1009
01:06:02,902 --> 01:06:05,372
Or must I expose you...

1010
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:07,872
for what you did?

1011
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:09,842
Ro Na.

1012
01:06:10,773 --> 01:06:12,912
Don't try to do anything for me ever again.

1013
01:06:14,172 --> 01:06:15,642
I'll take care of myself.

1014
01:06:18,852 --> 01:06:21,453
Where are you going at this hour?

1015
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:24,652
Ro Na. Please talk to me!

1016
01:06:36,433 --> 01:06:37,803
What do you mean?

1017
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:40,632
Don't raise your voice at the table.

1018
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:43,402
Why are you accepting Ro Na?

1019
01:06:43,842 --> 01:06:45,213
What are you thinking?

1020
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:47,612
I don't want to go to
the same school with her!

1021
01:06:48,783 --> 01:06:51,043
You're the director. Can't
you stop something like that?

1022
01:06:53,553 --> 01:06:56,852
Are you whining because you're
scared of someone like her?

1023
01:06:57,652 --> 01:07:00,053
You're the top student right now.

1024
01:07:00,053 --> 01:07:02,922
I think it would be good
for you to have a pacemaker.

1025
01:07:03,723 --> 01:07:04,832
Is this...

1026
01:07:05,592 --> 01:07:07,362
about Cheong A Art Festival?

1027
01:07:07,362 --> 01:07:09,203
In case you lose to Ro Na?

1028
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:11,433
That will never happen.

1029
01:07:11,433 --> 01:07:14,473
I won't lose to a loser like her.

1030
01:07:14,473 --> 01:07:17,443
That's right. Now, that's my girl.

1031
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:21,273
It's a blessing...

1032
01:07:21,812 --> 01:07:23,842
to have a rival.

1033
01:07:24,953 --> 01:07:26,382
Discussion over, okay?

1034
01:07:28,852 --> 01:07:30,183
Finish eating.

1035
01:07:30,183 --> 01:07:31,523
I have plans.

1036
01:07:37,293 --> 01:07:39,293
This isn't about the stupid trophy!

1037
01:07:42,003 --> 01:07:44,263
She doesn't know anything.

1038
01:07:49,072 --> 01:07:50,203
You must be upset...

1039
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:53,713
that Seok Hoon will go
back to Ro Na, aren't you?

1040
01:07:55,582 --> 01:07:56,582
Yes.

1041
01:07:58,612 --> 01:08:00,412
I'm so nervous.

1042
01:08:01,622 --> 01:08:05,092
Seok Hoon is the only one for me.

1043
01:08:05,652 --> 01:08:07,553
Do you want me to call him?

1044
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:10,263
I got the sample questions for the mock exam.

1045
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:17,362
I have an important meeting,
so I'm still at the office.

1046
01:08:17,703 --> 01:08:20,303
I'll see you at the hotel. I
won't be late. How do you feel?

1047
01:08:20,303 --> 01:08:22,473
Not bad.

1048
01:08:22,803 --> 01:08:26,142
I'm excited about spending time with you.

1049
01:08:26,943 --> 01:08:28,243
So am I.

1050
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,612
I love you.

1051
01:08:32,553 --> 01:08:35,322
Okay... So this...

1052
01:08:36,152 --> 01:08:39,793
is proof that someone else sang
at Seo Jin's concert, correct?

1053
01:08:40,422 --> 01:08:42,423
I included messages
exchanged with the broker.

1054
01:08:42,423 --> 01:08:43,823
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

1055
01:08:45,293 --> 01:08:47,392
You're a very good worker.

1056
01:08:47,963 --> 01:08:51,973
No wonder Seo Jin trusts you so much.

1057
01:08:52,473 --> 01:08:55,943
May I assume our relationship
has become stronger through this?

1058
01:08:55,943 --> 01:08:58,043
This is where it ends between us.

1059
01:08:58,443 --> 01:08:59,743
If you demand more,

1060
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:02,382
I'll have to tell Ms. Cheon.

1061
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:06,053
Hearing you say that makes me trust you more.

1062
01:09:06,882 --> 01:09:08,483
I won't take your calls anymore.

1063
01:09:51,663 --> 01:09:52,792
Where are you?

1064
01:09:54,763 --> 01:09:56,902
Hurry up. I want to see you.

1065
01:10:00,303 --> 01:10:01,303
Eun Byeol.

1066
01:10:04,442 --> 01:10:05,513
Eun Byeol?

1067
01:10:17,783 --> 01:10:18,792
Are you inside?

1068
01:10:21,252 --> 01:10:22,263
Are you here?

1069
01:10:26,763 --> 01:10:27,763
Who are you?

1070
01:10:36,973 --> 01:10:38,243
What are you doing?

1071
01:10:38,643 --> 01:10:39,873
Why are you here?

1072
01:11:40,103 --> 01:11:42,442
THE PENTHOUSE 2

1073
01:11:42,442 --> 01:11:44,572
<i>You deceived me and met another man.</i>

1074
01:11:44,572 --> 01:11:46,612
<i>How long have you been
keeping secrets from me?</i>

1075
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:49,083
<i>We have no legal obligations
to each other yet.</i>

1076
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:50,882
<i>I wondered how you were doing.</i>

1077
01:11:50,882 --> 01:11:52,652
<i>Didn't you wonder about me?</i>

1078
01:11:52,652 --> 01:11:55,013
<i>I'm acting in order to get you back.</i>

1079
01:11:55,013 --> 01:11:57,683
<i>Shut it! Your mom is the
one who killed my mom.</i>

1080
01:11:57,683 --> 01:11:59,553
<i>You promised to protect Ro Na.</i>

1081
01:11:59,553 --> 01:12:01,152
<i>I'll do whatever it takes...</i>

1082
01:12:01,152 --> 01:12:03,292
<i>to get the Cheong A Art Festival trophy.</i>

1083
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:04,292
<i>You've got some nerve.</i>

1084
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:07,232
<i>I may just kill your daughter Seok Kyung.</i>
