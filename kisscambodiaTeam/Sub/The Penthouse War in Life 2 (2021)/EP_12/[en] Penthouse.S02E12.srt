00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,769
(Police)

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,010
(Episode 12)

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,208
Make sure not to miss a spot.

4
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:18,350
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,159
(Police)

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,860
- There are photos here.
- Take it.

7
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,029
There are more here.

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,229
Why would anyone hide photos
under the couch?

9
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:37,270
There's one here.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,870
Isn't that Cheon Seo Jin? Take it.

11
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:43,469
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,819
Hey. Move this.

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,060
Where are the bars?

14
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,599
I'm sorry! Please don't kill me.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,409
- Please don't kill me.
- It's okay. We're the police.

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,080
- I'm sorry!
- It's okay. We're the police.

17
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:22,309
What's your name?

18
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,919
I'm Shim Su Ryeon.

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,819
Were you locked in here?

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,660
Joo Dan Tae...

21
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,330
locked us in here.

22
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,530
How long have you been here?

23
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,039
What's today's date?

24
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:50,470
Please take this child
to the hospital first.

25
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,240
Please. Quick!

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,178
Call an ambulance right now.

27
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,479
We found people underground.
Two.

28
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:00,979
Are you okay?

29
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,860
Please light the way.

30
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,549
It sounds crazy,
but can you trust me for once?

31
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:39,289
I have a great plan...

32
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,460
to finish off Dan Tae.

33
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,900
What did you just say?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,129
You want to get back at him.

35
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,129
Then do it.

36
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,199
I'll take his money.

37
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:55,538
But you can't tell anyone...

38
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,910
about me.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,549
What do you say? Deal?

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,549
Forget it. I don't trust you.

41
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,120
What if I leave this to you?

42
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:23,100
Protect your daughter yourself.

43
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,299
You must protect your child
at all costs.

44
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:29,109
Since you're her mom.

45
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Mothers need to get evil to protect
their children sometimes, no?

46
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,519
You said a mother should do
anything for her child.

47
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,359
I canceled the contract?

48
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,059
Didn't you know?

49
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,459
Na Ae Gyo suddenly
notified me last night...

50
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,269
that she was canceling the contract.

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,728
I know you wanted it for a while.

52
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:00,599
So I came to ask
why you changed your mind.

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,239
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,478
She said she needed the cash
urgently.

55
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,849
She seemed desperate,

56
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,249
so I didn't even charge her
the penalty.

57
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,418
No one can cancel the contract
without my permission.

58
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:19,019
Then did Na Ae Gyo deceive you?

59
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,970
(Property Sale Contract
Cancellation)

60
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,530
You must've trusted her
a great deal.

61
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,169
Enough to bet your all.

62
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,449
The person you have reached is
unavailable. Please leave...

63
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,048
My money...

64
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:47,650
How dare you take off with my money?

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,950
I'll kill you, Na Ae Gyo.

66
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,570
You can really get rid
of Joo Dan Tae?

67
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,799
As long as you do as I say.

68
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,770
We'll make...

69
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,470
Joo Dan Tae guilty of things,
one by one.

70
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,140
I'll help you, Cheon Seo Jin.

71
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:18,379
So that your daughter and Yoon Chul
can be proven innocent.

72
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,548
If you play along well,

73
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:23,390
we'll be able to get Eun Byeol's
necklace from him.

74
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,789
Really?

75
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,160
What do I have to do?

76
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,289
Tonight,

77
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,160
someone will die.

78
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:37,369
Who?

79
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Na Ae Gyo.

80
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,869
Na Ae Gyo...

81
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,309
Seok Kyung's birth mom?

82
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,010
So you knew.

83
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,210
I never met her.

84
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,878
I only know...

85
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,519
that Dan Tae has been meeting her
secretly about Cheonsoo District.

86
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:56,489
Did she take off with his money?

87
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:57,850
Pretty much.

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,590
Why do you want...

89
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,530
to kill her?

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,629
Are you telling me
to help you murder someone?

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,830
It's not your first time.

92
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,799
You helped Joo Dan Tae
to kill Su Ryeon,

93
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:13,669
didn't you?

94
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,710
Did you forget already?

95
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,780
It's time to pay him back...

96
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,609
for everything I've received.

97
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,679
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

98
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,390
If you want to live in misery
in the palm of his hand forever.

99
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,960
I'll do it. I'll do anything.

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,228
But you have to keep your promise.

101
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,100
Give me Eun Byeol's necklace.

102
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:49,970
Don't worry. I'll keep my promise.

103
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:12,359
Na Ae Gyo will
die tonight at 10 p.m.

104
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,070
We must finish everything
before then.

105
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,270
(1 hour before Na Ae Gyo's death)

106
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,859
(Sleep inducer)

107
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,700
What took you so long?

108
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,559
I asked you to bring me drinks
ages ago.

109
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,869
Who are you
so desperately looking for?

110
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,739
Who is this Na Ae Gyo?

111
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,539
Why? Are you
going to find her for me?

112
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,618
Slow down. You'll get drunk.

113
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,390
Stop getting on my nerves
and get lost.

114
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,140
Darn it. Seriously.

115
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,939
Bring the money to the storage
by 10 p.m. and I'll spare your life.

116
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
(Na Ae Gyo)

117
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,109
It's time.

118
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,478
I put his clothes
and shoes in there.

119
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,248
Update me on his every move.

120
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,450
He may wake up.

121
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,179
He's passed out.

122
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,220
He won't wake up
even if you beat him with a stick.

123
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,589
This has to work.

124
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,759
Eun Byeol's and my lives
depend on it.

125
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:32,999
I can trust you, right?

126
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,050
Please check the memory card.

127
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:01,190
(30 minutes
before Na Ae Gyo's death)

128
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,879
- Where's Na Ae Gyo?
- She's heading to the warehouse.

129
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,220
Be careful.

130
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,790
You too.

131
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,710
(1 minute before Na Ae Gyo's death)

132
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Hello?

133
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:30,779
Joo Dan Tae is trying to kill me.

134
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:32,379
Save me.

135
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,119
Where am I?

136
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,619
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

137
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,290
I'm okay.

138
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:12,820
Thank goodness.

139
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,830
Escort her safely.

140
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,590
Here.

141
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:20,330
Dan Tae gave this ring to Ae Gyo.

142
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,300
Use it as evidence.

143
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,290
(Rest in Peace)

144
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:53,220
(Shim Su Ryeon)

145
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,279
(4 hours after Na Ae Gyo's death)

146
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,728
Please take care of the rest.

147
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,790
Stay safe, Logan.

148
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,399
Where's Dan Tae's phone?

149
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,609
Come to the storage
with the other guys right now.

150
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,050
(Power off)

151
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,190
Joo Dan Tae, you're doomed.

152
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,600
Stay here and keep an eye on him.

153
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:25,909
Everyone to the cottage.

154
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:37,719
(Emergency Medical Center)

155
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,330
It's been a while, Seok Hoon.
We'll chat later.

156
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,368
Leave Ro Na to me now.
You stay out of it.

157
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,309
No. Let me come with you.

158
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,449
I can't trust anything grown-ups say
without seeing it with my own eyes.

159
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,839
Mom, will Ro Na be okay?

160
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,339
You trust me, right?
I'll protect her.

161
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,580
Don't worry.

162
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:34,409
Where's Seok Kyung?

163
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:36,750
I told her to stay
in the study room.

164
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,109
That's good.

165
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,218
The police will storm any minute.

166
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,350
Don't go home tonight.

167
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,658
Leave now
and take Seok Hoon with you.

168
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,560
I'll take over from here.

169
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,709
Whatever you do,

170
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:09,609
I'm on your side.

171
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,320
Okay. Thanks for trusting me.

172
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,159
Ms. Shim?

173
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,669
Where am I?

174
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,800
I'm about to ask you...

175
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,340
to do something difficult.

176
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm planning to punish
the people who harmed you.

177
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,149
If we do that,

178
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:48,649
can we go back to the way we were?

179
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,790
I'll do anything.

180
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,629
I'd like to pay you and Seol A back.

181
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,819
Go to the cottage in Pangyo,
place the pictures,

182
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,319
and lock the basement door.

183
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,200
(5 hours and 20 minutes
after Na Ae Gyo's death)

184
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,139
(6 hours after Na Ae Gyo's death)

185
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,939
Explain what's going on.

186
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,040
Did Na Ae Gyo really die?

187
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,740
You couldn't have done it
on your own.

188
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,109
Who's behind you? Logan?

189
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,809
You'll see tomorrow.

190
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,449
Just finish things up well.

191
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,189
I did everything you told me to do.
Keep your word.

192
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,389
Where's Eun Byeol's necklace?

193
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,760
It's in Dan Tae's cottage in Pangyo.

194
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,368
This is the key to the drawer.
I don't know exactly where it is.

195
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,740
Get back before Dan Tae wakes up.
6 a.m. at the latest.

196
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,310
The police will start searching
the cottage in the morning.

197
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,939
What are you waiting for?

198
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,020
Gosh!

199
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,000
Darn it. Which drawer is it?

200
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,899
Where's the necklace?

201
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,250
(Alarm, 6 a.m.)

202
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,129
(8 hours after Na Ae Gyo's death)

203
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,909
How are you feeling?

204
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:09,750
What happened yesterday?

205
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,719
You blacked out
because you drank too fast.

206
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,619
Should I make some soup?

207
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,820
No, you don't have to.

208
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:18,990
My head is splitting.

209
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:22,019
Why can't I remember anything?

210
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,889
I didn't drink that much.

211
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,299
Where's my phone?
I couldn't find it in the room.

212
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,169
I haven't seen it. Should I call it?

213
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,520
This is a search and
seizure warrant.

214
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,249
Dan Tae!

215
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,189
- Don't step on this.
- Dan Tae!

216
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,418
Dan Tae! Dan Tae!

217
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,489
Don't step on this either.

218
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,930
- Search the place.
- These people...

219
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,429
- Joo Dan Tae, correct?
- I am.

220
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:05,628
You are under arrest...

221
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,570
for murder and desecration
of a human corpse.

222
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,770
Cuff him.

223
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,439
What are you talking about?

224
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:13,678
- Whom did I kill?
- Stop it.

225
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,540
Are you people out of your minds?

226
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,050
Na Ae Gyo died last night.

227
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,290
Ae Gyo died?

228
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,820
- Oh my gosh.
- Let's talk at the station.

229
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:29,628
- Wait.
- Dan Tae.

230
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:32,059
Dan Tae. What's going on?
You killed a person?

231
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,729
You didn't right? Talk to me!

232
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,599
He has a soft heart.
He can't even kill a bug.

233
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,928
There must be a mistake.

234
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,369
- Let go!
- Then...

235
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:43,740
can you confirm where he was
last night?

236
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,240
You know...

237
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,239
I came home early and went to sleep.

238
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,439
Tell them.

239
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:52,619
We use separate rooms,
so I'm not positive.

240
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,579
I know he was drunk...

241
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,389
and very upset.
That's all I know...

242
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,189
Wait. He kept calling someone.

243
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:01,719
Who?

244
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,489
He said, "Na Ae Gyo."

245
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,299
Why you... Have you gone mad?

246
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,359
Let go of me!

247
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:09,398
I did not kill her.

248
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:10,599
Show me proof!

249
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,269
I won't go anywhere until you do.

250
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,740
Call my secretary. Get my lawyer!

251
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:15,969
Darn it.

252
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,669
We found this in the chimney.

253
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:19,639
Oh my gosh.

254
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,080
A partially burned glove,
raincoat, and shoes.

255
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,648
- Take it as evidence.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,079
It wasn't me.
I've never even seen that before.

257
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,820
I saw muddy footprints...

258
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,659
by the door this morning,
so I thought it was strange.

259
00:26:33,189 --> 00:26:36,128
Did you really kill that woman?

260
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,990
The kids' biological mom?

261
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,359
How do you know...

262
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,199
who Ae Gyo is?

263
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Take him away.

264
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:56,608
Let go!

265
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:58,750
What do you mean, I killed someone?

266
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,550
Let go!

267
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,750
Who are you?

268
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:04,949
Why is he there? What are you doing?

269
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:06,819
Let go!

270
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,888
What are you doing here?

271
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:09,889
You punk!

272
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,198
It's payback.

273
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,329
Payback? Ridiculous!

274
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,668
Hey! Logan!

275
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,969
Why is he over there?

276
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,139
(Search History)

277
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,809
He's searched up a warehouse
and a crematorium.

278
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,878
- What about the dashcam?
- It doesn't have a memory card.

279
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,839
He must've taken it out
before he started driving.

280
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:34,119
There's a ring here.

281
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,949
Collect it.
Retrieve all fingerprints too.

282
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,319
Cheong A Group's Chairman,
Joo Dan Tae,

283
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,358
has been arrested
without a warrant just now.

284
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,158
The victim, Ms. Na, is...

285
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:47,559
the birth mother
of his two children,

286
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,569
Chairman Joo's business partner,

287
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,569
as well as his mistress
for a long time.

288
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,040
This is a shock to everyone.

289
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:56,540
Give me updates.

290
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520
The DNA is a match
with Joo Dan Tae's.

291
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:03,479
We found these
at the animal crematorium.

292
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,310
These look like ashes of a bag.

293
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,050
Is this the man who came last night?

294
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,290
Yes, it is.

295
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,429
Last night, I think it was because
of money,

296
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:21,829
but Chairman Joo seemed furious.

297
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,270
It was about selling properties
without his permission.

298
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:28,969
He was beating the woman
like he was going to kill her.

299
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,439
I've already put
the surveillance camera footage...

300
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,780
into this flash drive.

301
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,119
There's something here.

302
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,819
It's an urn.

303
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,820
An urn?

304
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:46,359
Oh my gosh! It can't be!

305
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:49,319
Send it to NFS right away.

306
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,059
Find out if there's any DNA left.

307
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,129
- Rush it.
- Yes, sir.

308
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,310
Oh Yoon Hee, why aren't you
picking up?

309
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:12,050
Okay.

310
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,790
They found human ashes...

311
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,219
in your study.

312
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,520
Ashes?

313
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,428
What ridiculous gibberish is that?

314
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,659
Why would there be ashes in my home?

315
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I heard you said
you'd kill Na Ae Gyo.

316
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,369
We have a witness.

317
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,398
What witness?

318
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,168
I slept all day. Who saw me? Where?

319
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:38,570
I'm the witness.

320
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:47,320
What is this gibberish?

321
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:52,350
I met with him yesterday morning
in his penthouse.

322
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,159
He was extremely angry at Na Ae Gyo.

323
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,589
The look in his eyes was terrifying.

324
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,859
So I recorded it just in case.

325
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,929
My money...
How dare you take off with my money?

326
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,340
I'll kill you, Na Ae Gyo.

327
00:30:09,939 --> 00:30:11,570
You have a clear motive,

328
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,339
and all the circumstances
point to you.

329
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,310
Will you still deny it?

330
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,179
Is there any record of her
making direct threats?

331
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:25,249
She said this to me.

332
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,260
I recorded it just in case.

333
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:31,560
I waited because I have
a favor to ask you.

334
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:34,099
(Recording)

335
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,159
Get rid...

336
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:37,899
of Shim Su Ryeon.

337
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,909
Oh Yoon Hee. You...

338
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:59,189
You've got a lot of enemies
around you,

339
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:04,429
which made it much easier for me,
of course.

340
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:06,199
What?

341
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,260
You taught me.

342
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,770
If there's no proof,
I must make the proof.

343
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,669
How do you feel
now that you're the murderer?

344
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,009
Oh Yoon Hee! Cheon Seo Jin!

345
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,608
You witches did it, didn't you?

346
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:22,949
I'm going to kill all of you.

347
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:24,979
I'm going to kill you!

348
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,449
I'll kill you!

349
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,648
I'm going to kill you!

350
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:29,790
Let go!

351
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,648
I'm going to kill her! Let go of me!

352
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:34,419
Let go!

353
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,090
Don't worry.

354
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,330
You won't rot in jail alone.

355
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,199
Good luck.

356
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:51,310
Oh Yoon Hee! Stop there.

357
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:55,109
Where's Na Ae Gyo?
What have you done to her?

358
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,948
Let go of me! I didn't kill her.

359
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:00,218
This is all a setup!

360
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,118
Get that crazy witch, Oh Yoon Hee!

361
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,918
I didn't kill her!

362
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,820
I didn't do such a thing. Let me go!

363
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,919
(National Forensic Service)

364
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,830
- Block the reporters.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,929
Don't take photos.

366
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:21,300
Get out of the way.

367
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,708
What happened at the cottage?

368
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:29,849
(Detective)

369
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,179
When I asked for a divorce,

370
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,949
Joo Dan Tae...

371
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,820
forged my death...

372
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,719
and locked me up at the cottage.

373
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:44,330
And every night,

374
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:47,500
he threatened me to give him
all of my wealth.

375
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,230
When I refused,

376
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:55,369
he...

377
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,740
did terrible things to me
in the basement.

378
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,830
Do you remember who hurt you?

379
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:27,869
Yes.

380
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,310
Who is it?

381
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:39,980
It's okay. You can tell them.

382
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,520
It's Mr. Joo Dan Tae
from the penthouse.

383
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,530
(VIP Patient Room)

384
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,589
Everything is fine, right?

385
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,389
It's all good?

386
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,460
Everything is done.

387
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,759
I told my testimony.

388
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,799
It's all thanks to you, Logan.

389
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,279
I was so scared...

390
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,750
that you'd disappear again.

391
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,119
I'm so glad.

392
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:53,960
I'm very glad.

393
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,670
Don't leave me again.

394
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,539
I'm sorry.

395
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,249
Please investigate thoroughly.

396
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,550
- Have a safe trip back.
- Goodbye.

397
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,599
Secretary Do,
get the divorce papers ready.

398
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,538
Check if it's possible for me
to get all my properties,

399
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,768
50 million dollars, and shares
to Cheong A Group back from him.

400
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:20,110
Look into it right now.

401
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:26,110
My goodness.

402
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,550
When did you come back?

403
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:32,619
Didn't you say that you were
going to study in the study room?

404
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:37,059
Everything you've said.
Are they all true?

405
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,889
Are you saying I'm lying?

406
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,658
You're talking as if you were
waiting for this to happen.

407
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,530
As if you knew all the things
my dad has done.

408
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:55,010
Did my dad really kill
my birth mother?

409
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,079
You must be shocked because your dad
has been arrested.

410
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,389
But this is your dad's true self.

411
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,860
Although, you probably already knew.

412
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,730
Are you completely innocent?

413
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:16,760
Is my dad the only bad one?

414
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,659
What?

415
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:23,769
I don't care about who you are.

416
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,039
You don't want to be my mom, anyway.

417
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,590
I guess I'm really an orphan now.

418
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,860
Where are you, Seok Hoon?

419
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,699
Come to Cheong A Medical Center
right now.

420
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:55,199
Why?

421
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,500
We have to see Mom.

422
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:00,869
Mom?

423
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:04,339
(Police)

424
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,348
Chairman! What happened?

425
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:08,949
What took you so long to get here,
you useless rat?

426
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,018
You texted me to come
to the storage,

427
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:12,319
so I got everyone there.

428
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,249
What storage? I didn't text you
such a thing!

429
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,518
Hire a lawyer right now.

430
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,230
Get every lawyer you can,
whether it be 10 or 100!

431
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,399
I'll kill you if you don't get me
out of here!

432
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,829
Get your work done, you rat!

433
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:29,468
What's happening?

434
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:32,768
A murder? Is Chairman Joo crazy?

435
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,439
I can't believe...

436
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,638
that I was his neighbor!

437
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,249
I'm too scared to live
at this condo now.

438
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,118
It's a relief that he didn't
kill her in the building.

439
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,848
Why is that a relief?

440
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:46,388
From Chairman Joo to Dr. Ha,

441
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:49,759
how many murderers have we had
at Hera Palace lately?

442
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,058
How could that be?

443
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:53,860
How could Chairman Joo kill
the twins' birth mother?

444
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,129
I saw the detectives leaving
just now.

445
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,730
Did they get all evidence?

446
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,328
It's exactly what you saw
on the news.

447
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:05,099
I'm exhausted. Let's talk
another time.

448
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:08,268
The woman we saw at the auction...

449
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:09,940
is the twins' birth mother.

450
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,979
You know, the one
with huge sunglasses...

451
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,249
and colorful clothes.

452
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,118
The one who called
50 million dollars.

453
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,448
No wonder she called
such a high price.

454
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:21,348
It was her?

455
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:24,919
I guess she's been planning
to scam Chairman Joo for a while.

456
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,058
She sold all the Cheonsoo District
properties and fled.

457
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:30,929
Poor Chairman Joo.

458
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:34,529
He lost his money, got betrayed,
and is now a murderer.

459
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,299
Why would you feel bad for him?

460
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,399
Why would you feel bad for a man...

461
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,609
who hid his children's
birth mother...

462
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,340
as his mistress for 20 years?

463
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,380
He should be executed right away.

464
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,780
Seo Jin, how much did you know?

465
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,619
You couldn't have known anything.

466
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,319
I didn't know anything.

467
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,459
I've never even seen
the birth mother.

468
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,960
You didn't know that Shim Su Ryeon
is alive, either?

469
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:03,829
What?

470
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,070
What?

471
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,400
What do you mean?

472
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:14,268
Who's alive?

473
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:15,909
You haven't heard?

474
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,638
It's on the news everywhere.

475
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,279
Shim Su Ryeon. She's back.

476
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,320
And she's alive.

477
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,888
She's been locked
in the Ex-wife 1 Cottage...

478
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:27,349
for two whole years.

479
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:28,619
A...

480
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:31,658
A cottage?

481
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:34,828
Apparently, Chairman Joo locked
Su Ryeon up at the cottage...

482
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:38,230
and tortured her
while only giving her water.

483
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,069
I almost peed myself
because I was so scared.

484
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,440
What's happening now, then?

485
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:47,709
Who's his wife? Su Ryeon or you?

486
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,379
Why is that important?
As if being his wife is good.

487
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,579
Not getting involved
with that psychopath is luck.

488
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,448
Shim Su Ryeon is alive?

489
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:57,550
No way! That can't be.

490
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,119
Why do you want to kill her?

491
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,888
Are you telling me
to help you murder someone?

492
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:06,730
It's not your first time.

493
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,730
You helped Joo Dan Tae
to kill Su Ryeon,

494
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:12,670
didn't you?

495
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,670
Did you forget already?

496
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,340
It's time to pay him back...

497
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,139
for everything I've received.

498
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,449
It was Shim Su Ryeon
behind Oh Yoon Hee!

499
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,550
Does that mean that I've been
helping Shim Su Ryeon myself?

500
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,050
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

501
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:37,719
No!

502
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,059
- What?
- No!

503
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,029
No!

504
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,969
Ms. Cheon? Where is she going?

505
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,699
We haven't even gotten to the part
where Ro Na is alive.

506
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,909
What if there's a war
at Hera Palace?

507
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,038
I bet Su Ryeon hates everyone here.

508
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,739
I'm getting goosebumps.

509
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,409
I don't feel good about this.

510
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:05,348
What if Su Ryeon tries to harm us?

511
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:08,219
What did we do wrong?

512
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:11,590
Chairman Joo is the one
who kidnapped and locked her up!

513
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,030
Don't get scared!

514
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:16,659
And that was so long ago.

515
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,500
What?

516
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:22,130
Don't get scared!

517
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,789
(Unit 4502
The bell is ringing.)

518
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,089
Open the door, Oh Yoon Hee!
I know you're there. Come out!

519
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,960
Come out and talk to me!

520
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:50,158
You knew that Shim Su Ryeon was
alive all along, didn't you?

521
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,229
Get out!

522
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,198
What are you up to?

523
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,699
Tell me!

524
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:59,369
(Unit 4502)

525
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:03,880
(Cheon Seo Jin)

526
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:06,750
(Power off)

527
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:32,369
My pretty daughter.

528
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,769
I...

529
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:41,250
miss you so much.

530
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,650
Eun Byeol! Eun Byeol!

531
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:15,179
Ms. Jin.

532
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,920
Ms. Jin!

533
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,449
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol!

534
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:22,349
Eun Byeol.

535
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:26,489
What happened to her room?

536
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:33,899
The person you have reached...

537
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,730
Eun Byeol.

538
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,039
- Where are they?
- The phone is turned off. Please...

539
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,250
Where's Eun Byeol?

540
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,788
I sent her to the pool...

541
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:55,449
since I'm cleaning out her room.

542
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,488
There were too many books
and clothes that she doesn't need.

543
00:44:58,489 --> 00:44:59,888
I'm replacing her furniture
as well...

544
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:01,730
to cheer her up.

545
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,558
Why are you doing that?

546
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:06,329
If I don't do it, who will?

547
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,099
I'll take full care of her
from now on.

548
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,739
She needs me
more than she needs her mom.

549
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,869
Didn't you know that?

550
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,440
What?

551
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:19,239
You crazy...

552
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,249
You're fired.

553
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,920
Get out of my home now.

554
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,250
Didn't you hear me?

555
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,420
Get out before I drag you out.

556
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,119
You're the one who needs to leave.

557
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:32,989
Come in.

558
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:39,699
(Warrant for Arrest)

559
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,130
Cheon Seo Jin.

560
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,730
What is it?

561
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,599
I have nothing more to say...

562
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,570
about Dan Tae.

563
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,520
Do you admit
to working with Joo Dan Tae...

564
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:51,209
in the abduction
and false imprisonment...

565
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,650
of Shim Su Ryeon and Bae Ro Na?

566
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,509
Abduction?

567
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,280
I know nothing about it.

568
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,380
The victims already gave
their statements.

569
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:02,860
Did you do it to steal
Shim Su Ryeon's fortune...

570
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:04,459
and husband?

571
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,658
Who said such nonsense?

572
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:07,888
I didn't even know
that Su Ryeon was alive.

573
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:08,960
Last night...

574
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:12,029
you used the secret passage...

575
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,530
and went to the cottage
where Shim Su Ryeon was being held.

576
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:26,610
Yoon Hee.

577
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,579
Was this what you were trying to do?

578
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,089
You are under arrest
for kidnapping, false imprisonment,

579
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,529
and assault.

580
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:43,530
Cuff her.

581
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:47,229
Ms. Jin, where's Eun Byeol?

582
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,499
I have to see her.

583
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,038
This isn't true.

584
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,598
Bring her to me. Hurry.

585
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,739
Hurry!

586
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,109
Don't worry too much
about Eun Byeol.

587
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,509
I'll take care of her like her mom.

588
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,649
I told you,
she's like a daughter to me.

589
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,650
Where is Eun Byeol?

590
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,150
Where is she? No. Let go of me!

591
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:07,349
Let go!

592
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:09,889
That's right.

593
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,789
Ro Na's mom from unit 4502
said to give this to you.

594
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:15,190
She said you'd know.

595
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,730
Take it.

596
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,000
No. No. Give it back! No!

597
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:22,500
Who are you?

598
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:23,940
Are you with Yoon Hee?

599
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:25,300
No, right?

600
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,908
Tell me you're not.

601
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:28,569
What did you do with Eun Byeol?

602
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,879
Let go! I'm innocent.
I didn't do it!

603
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,049
Something went seriously wrong.
Let go!

604
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,649
Let go. Ms. Jin. Where's Eun Byeol?

605
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,909
I didn't do it!

606
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,789
Chairman Joo Dan Tae,
you'll have to brace yourself.

607
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:44,218
The murder of Na Ae Gyo,

608
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:46,590
the kidnapping and false
imprisonment of Shim Su Ryeon,

609
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,329
and the attempted murder
of Bae Ro Na.

610
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,630
Su Ryeon was alive?

611
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:57,400
She was with Ro Na?

612
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,070
In my cottage?

613
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,079
Insane.

614
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,710
This is insane.

615
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,250
Who came up with this insane...

616
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,079
I have a question for you.

617
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:14,019
When did you quit smoking?

618
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,360
Did I not tell you?

619
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,989
I quit because I couldn't stop
coughing.

620
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:23,460
Maybe it's because I haven't
seen you in a while.

621
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,639
You feel...

622
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,969
a little different.

623
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:35,139
The way you hold your glass.

624
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:39,038
You always held your glass
with your left hand,

625
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:40,650
but you're holding it
with your right.

626
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:44,419
You got angry at me when I asked you
to change yourself...

627
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,695
to be right-handed just so that you
can be like Shim Su Ryeon.

628
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,018
Having had to pretend
I'm Shim Su Ryeon my whole life,

629
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:51,920
I guess I got used to using
my right hand.

630
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,929
Shim Su Ryeon?

631
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:03,039
She was Su Ryeon, not Ae Gyo.

632
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:06,639
Then who died back then?

633
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,980
How could you...

634
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:26,630
No. That can't be.

635
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:30,199
No way. That's ridiculous.

636
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,460
No.

637
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,769
No! It can't be.

638
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,368
- It can't be.
- Grab him!

639
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:40,169
No! It isn't true. Bring me Ae Gyo.

640
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,409
I didn't do it! No!

641
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:44,678
- Stay still!
- No!

642
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:46,780
Hold him tight.

643
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,849
Ae Gyo...

644
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,150
The detention warrant
will be issued soon.

645
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,718
You can't get out of it this time...

646
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:00,530
even if the man upstairs
has your back.

647
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:02,760
So give up, Chairman Joo.

648
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,670
Wait. Please.

649
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:09,029
Let me make a phone call.
Just one call.

650
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,339
You already called all your lawyers.

651
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,710
Give me your cell phone
before I rip your mouth!

652
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,010
Now!

653
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:20,809
The district originally selected
for redevelopment...

654
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:22,679
was Opyeong, not Cheonsoo.

655
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,919
Did you really...

656
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,489
change the district
just for Joo Dan Tae?

657
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:28,889

659
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,500
I know what your relationship was
with his wife.

660
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:45,170
Did you give him the information...

661
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,710
for her?

662
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,110
But sadly,
the woman you were seeing...

663
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:52,139
was not Shim Su Ryeon.

664
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,110
I know.

665
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:58,750
She was...

666
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,658
Na Ae Gyo.

(Happy Future Party)

668
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:09,529
You knew?

669
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,030
Ever since I was young,

670
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:14,400
I looked up to Chairman Shim
of Simoon Construction,

671
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,340
and received a lot of help from him.

672
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:19,139
At first,

673
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,710
I saw her
because she was his daughter.

674
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:25,480
But I knew right away...

675
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,419
that she was a completely
different person.

676
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,519
Then why did you continue
to see her?

677
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:35,449
I...

678
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:38,590
loved the woman...

679
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:41,190
Na Ae Gyo.

680
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:44,460
People can judge me all they want,

681
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,829
but my feelings for her were real.

682
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,639
She was a sad woman.

683
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,139
I don't get it.

684
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,110
Why did you give her
the information...

685
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,610
if you knew who she was?

686
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,449
That was the only way
she could live.

687
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,630
Joo Dan Tae would've
killed Ae Gyo as well...

688
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:18,130
once she stopped
being useful to him.

689
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,729
He never forgave anyone...

690
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,070
who betrayed him,
regardless of who that may be.

691
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,939
Then she tried to leave the country
two years ago...

692
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,610
To escape...

693
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,210
from Joo Dan Tae.

694
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,510
I got her...

695
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,949
a house to live in abroad, but...

696
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:44,489
she never came.

697
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:48,889
I found out
after I lost contact with her...

698
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:52,960
That it wasn't Su Ryeon...

699
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:57,869
but Ae Gyo who died.

700
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:10,448
Mr. Jung, this is Joo Dan Tae.

701
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:12,718
I'm at the police station right now.
Hello?

704
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,329
I guess...

705
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,570
it's time to put everything right.

706
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,539
Ae Gyo was killed...

707
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,940
by Joo Dan Tae.

708
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,650
And I finally get to destroy him.

709
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,150
I'm relieved.

710
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:48,590
But you might get hurt.

711
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:52,289
I'm prepared.

712
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:55,559
What a crazy idiot.
How dare he hang up on me?

713
00:53:55,789 --> 00:53:58,098
After fooling around with my woman?

714
00:53:58,099 --> 00:53:59,900
I won't go down alone.

715
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,529
That little...

716
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,250
Everyone must have realized
what's going on.

717
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,869
Why don't you give up?

718
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:09,409
One more call.
Let me just make one more call.

719
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,010
It's an international call
this time.

720
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,618
Logan Lee. Your dad
won't be able to ignore me...

721
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,849
if he wants to keep
his 35 billion dollars.

722
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,029
She's not fully recovered yet.

723
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,959
Make sure she stays in bed.

724
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,360
Okay.

725
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,300
(Prescription medication)

726
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,339
Don't just wait. Call her.

727
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,809
I sent her a message earlier.
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

728
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,150
I don't know
what I should say to her first.

729
00:54:56,289 --> 00:55:00,090
And she's probably too shocked
to even rush over.

730
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,239
Thanks, Logan.

731
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:24,280
The meeting with Mr. Jung went well.

732
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,750
Dan Tae must be losing his mind
right now.

733
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:31,690
All his connections
have been cut off.

734
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:35,989
It seems like Mr. Jung
sincerely loved Ae Gyo.

735
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:38,000
Did you know that?

736
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:41,328
I could sense it...

737
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:43,840
when I first saw Ae Gyo
at a hotel...

738
00:55:44,869 --> 00:55:46,500
two years ago.

739
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:53,849
See you.

740
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:22,909
- Su Ryeon.
- Does this make you happy?

741
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,738
Making money...

742
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:28,348
by impersonating another person
and deceiving people?

743
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:31,480
This is why I despise rich women.

744
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,389
It's not like I killed someone.

745
00:56:36,889 --> 00:56:38,988
You'll never understand...

746
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:41,360
because you've never been poor
in your life.

747
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:43,699
But everyone lives like me.

748
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,130
They lie when they can
and feel humiliated at times.

749
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,510
If you're so tired of money,

750
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,368
why do you live so luxuriously
in a penthouse?

751
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:58,679
When did you start impersonating me?

752
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,049
Pretending to be Shim Su Ryeon,
you pry...

753
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,549
real estate information out of
politicians and build new buildings.

754
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,750
Did you think
no one would ever find out?

755
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,949
Come to your senses.

756
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,018
If you care about
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung,

757
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:12,789
you shouldn't cooperate
with someone like Joo Dan Tae.

758
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:17,059
Fine, I stole your name. So what?

759
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:21,400
People treated me like a human being
for once because I look like you.

760
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:24,299
Thinking I'm the Simoon Construction
chairman's daughter,

761
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,670
people buy me meals and clothes.

762
00:57:26,769 --> 00:57:29,209
They even voluntarily tell me
all kinds of information.

763
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,340
What's so wrong
with making use of it?

764
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,279
Don't I deserve to live like that?

765
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,480
I'll tell Mr. Jung everything.

766
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,280
That you're fake.

767
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,719
Stay away from him. Leave him alone.

768
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:44,959
If you mess with him,
you're dead meat.

769
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,989
So you do feel bad?

770
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:50,030
Then why are you
helping Joo Dan Tae?

771
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:53,260
I'm helping who?

772
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,030
Are you crazy?

773
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:58,968
All I do is receive political funds
from Joo Dan Tae...

774
00:57:58,969 --> 00:58:01,269
and help Mr. Jung.

775
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,340
It's the only thing
I can do for him.

776
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:07,280
It's the same
with Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung.

777
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:10,820
For my children to live comfortably
in a fancy home,

778
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:14,489
I must give Dan Tae what he wants.

779
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:22,690
Seok Hoon and Seok Kyung
aren't doing well.

780
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:25,960
They're being abused by Dan Tae.

781
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,340
"Abused"?

782
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:35,769
That son of a...

783
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,809
Na Ae Gyo was also...

784
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:44,250
in love with Mr. Jung.

785
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:49,449
Then it's not Mr. Jung but Dan Tae
who was fooled by her.

786
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:53,159
He believed Ae Gyo was on his side
until the end.

787
00:58:56,389 --> 00:59:00,699
Joo Dan Tae is
never going to give up.

788
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,110
To get himself out of trouble,
he'll find someone to blackmail.

789
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,409
We have to find a way
to corner him even more.

790
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,250
Mom?

791
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,420
Is that really you?

792
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:27,090
Seok Kyung.

793
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,139
Are you really my mom?

794
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,210
Answer me. Are you my mom?

795
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:51,849
Where have you been?

796
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,420
Why did you lie that you died?

797
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,489
Do you know...

798
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:01,489
how much I missed you?

799
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:07,099
I wanted to die every day.

800
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,400
Why did you do that? Why?

801
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,538
Mom.

802
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:21,050
- I hate you.
- I'm sorry it took me so long.

803
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:24,179
Sweetheart.

804
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,920
- I hate you.
- How have you been?

805
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,820
I'm sorry.

806
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,199
I'm sorry.

807
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,409
Your parents are being investigated
by the police in the US.

808
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:56,280
They were accused of illegal
bone marrow acquisition.

809
01:00:57,079 --> 01:00:59,820
Don't tell me you were involved.

810
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,690
I'm going back to the US
as soon as things settle down here.

811
01:01:03,389 --> 01:01:06,059
- I should be investigated.
- Logan.

812
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,659
It's only right for me
to pay for what I've done.

813
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:13,400
Don't say anything to Su Ryeon.

814
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,839
What about Ms. Oh?
Have you heard anything from her?

815
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,469
No. Her phone is turned off.

816
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,809
Ro Na hasn't heard anything
from her yet either.

817
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:26,610
Oh Yoon Hee.
What could she be thinking?

818
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:33,650
(Jin Bun Hong)

819
01:01:34,849 --> 01:01:38,119
Ms. Jin, have you seen Ms. Oh today?

820
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:41,489
No, I haven't.

821
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,699
I guess she went to see Ro Na.

822
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:49,929
I haven't said anything
to Eun Byeol yet.

823
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:54,309
She'll be too shocked
to find out Ro Na is still alive.

824
01:01:57,909 --> 01:02:01,849
Cheon Seo Jin was just arrested
by the police.

825
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:06,050
I guess she'll serve at least
a few years in prison.

826
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,889
This is the end of her.

827
01:02:11,619 --> 01:02:13,659
Thank you for everything.

828
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,489
Are you going back to the US?

829
01:02:16,659 --> 01:02:18,099
I'm not sure.

830
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:22,130
I'll take my time
and think about it.

831
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:37,219
Sweetheart,
you're sleeping like a baby.

832
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:42,590
Those people don't deserve
to be your parents.

833
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,860
From now on, I'll protect you.

834
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:49,659
Mommy will protect you.

835
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,130
Ms. Jin.

836
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,739
Is it night already?

837
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,809
How long was I asleep?

838
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,169
You were sound asleep,

839
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,840
so I didn't wake you.

840
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:11,079
My mom called.

841
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,550
I wonder why.

842
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,349
Your mom was...

843
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:19,089
arrested by the police.

844
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,389
What? She was? Why?

845
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,360
I don't know either,

846
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:25,129
but she must've been involved in...

847
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,268
the murder case of
Seok Hoon's mother two years ago.

848
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:28,429
She was?

849
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:31,500
My mom helped kill her? Why?

850
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:34,169
Where's my mom?

851
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,909
- Mom.
- Calm down.

852
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:40,549
Your mom said
not to tell you anything.

853
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,308
She said not to call...

854
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:43,949
or go see her.

855
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:47,649
She doesn't want to see you.

856
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,988
How could she go without telling me?

857
01:03:50,989 --> 01:03:53,190
She's supposed to be my mom.

858
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,089
You have me.

859
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:58,799
I will never leave you.

860
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,900
Really?

861
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,670
You won't leave me?

862
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:06,469
Don't worry. I will...

863
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:09,340
be your mom...

864
01:04:09,909 --> 01:04:11,679
and your dad.

865
01:04:27,889 --> 01:04:30,428
I'll charge you a flat fee...

866
01:04:30,429 --> 01:04:31,429
of 30 million dollars.

867
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,129
Then my law firm...

868
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,729
will create a team
of the best lawyers...

869
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,968
and get you out.

870
01:04:36,969 --> 01:04:38,769
What gibberish is that?

871
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:40,908
I'm bitter enough
that I was framed for murder,

872
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:42,869
and you want to overcharge me?

873
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:45,880
I don't care whether or not
you were framed.

874
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,579
But I've recently made
a large investment,

875
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:49,709
so I need cash.

876
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,419
If you pay it all upfront,
you'll get a 10-percent discount.

877
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,948
You'll get out on bail
within a month.

878
01:04:54,949 --> 01:04:56,849
If you pay less,

879
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,959
your time in detention
will get longer.

880
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,659
How dare you try to scam me
with that?

881
01:05:01,889 --> 01:05:03,058
I'm Joo Dan Tae.

882
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:06,098
I did nothing wrong. Why should I
pay you 30 million dollars?

883
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:09,530
You don't get it.
You are royally done for, punk.

884
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,739
"Punk"?

885
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:12,968
Murder,
desecration of a human corpse,

886
01:05:12,969 --> 01:05:14,729
kidnapping, false imprisonment,
embezzlement.

887
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:18,279
No other law firm
will represent you.

888
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,379
What? Will you wait
for a public defender?

889
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:24,480
You little twerp.
You knew, didn't you?

890
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:27,420
You schemed with Su Ryeon
and bought up my land.

891
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:29,920
Let go! Let go!

892
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,389
Lock the door.

893
01:05:33,989 --> 01:05:34,989
Stay still.

894
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,500
I've been too nice to you,
haven't I?

895
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:40,630
You don't know your place.

896
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,198
How dare
a former construction worker...

897
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:45,170
touch an assemblyman?

898
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:47,939
You rat.

899
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,739
Why you... Hold him properly.

900
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:57,149
Bite down hard.

901
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,650
Hadouken!

902
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:01,719
Sit him down.

903
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:08,888
Deposit the money by tomorrow.

904
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:10,059
Are you insane?

905
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:13,659
Don't be scared.

906
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:21,639
Have you heard
anything I've said?

907
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,339
I went to Na Ae Gyo's cottage
for the first time today.

908
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,939
How many times must I tell you?

909
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,780
Then why did you have
this key to the basement?

910
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:32,549
I got that from Yoon Hee.

911
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,949
It isn't mine.

912
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:38,920
We found your clothes, shoes,
and bags in the cottage...

913
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,030
as well as your wedding photos.

914
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,130
Do you still deny it?

915
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,309
Your fingerprints and hair were
found all over the place too.

916
01:06:56,469 --> 01:06:57,909
How will you explain that?

917
01:07:01,409 --> 01:07:03,010
Yoon Hee did this.

918
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,650
She schemed with Su Ryeon
to entrap me.

919
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,488
Bring her here.
Let me confront her.

920
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,089
She's behind this con.

921
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,619
You're all being fooled!

922
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,980
Sorry.

923
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:42,849
I promised to fix it,

924
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:45,090
but I didn't keep my promise.

925
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:46,719
It's okay.

926
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:52,530
It still feels like a dream
that I can sing again.

927
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,730
I got my voice back,

928
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:57,539
I got my first love back,

929
01:07:58,239 --> 01:07:59,570
and Ro Na's back.

930
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,210
I'm so happy lately.

931
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:05,880
Although it's just an act
that will come to an end eventually.

932
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:09,349
I'm happy if you're happy.

933
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,079
It feels like we're newlyweds.

934
01:08:15,789 --> 01:08:17,420
I get excited every time...

935
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:19,590
I come home.

936
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:22,829
Yoon Chul.

937
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:25,829
If after we finish our revenge...

938
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,729
What if I won't let you go?

939
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,369
Will you stay with me?

940
01:08:39,909 --> 01:08:41,350
Just kidding.

941
01:08:41,449 --> 01:08:42,479
Relax.

942
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:44,579
Are you that scared?

943
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:54,229
I won't let you go...

944
01:08:55,489 --> 01:08:56,859
even if you try to run away.

945
01:09:37,329 --> 01:09:38,340
2091.

946
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:40,239
2395.

947
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:42,810
2358. You have mail.

948
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:53,520
(Ha Yoon Chul)

949
01:10:02,789 --> 01:10:04,528
I have the feeling...

950
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:07,359
you're spending every day consumed
by regret and self-loathe.

951
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,029
That's why I'm writing you.

952
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:10,869
I know...

953
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:13,699
you didn't kill Ro Na.

954
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:16,710
They'll find the real killer soon,

955
01:10:16,939 --> 01:10:18,640
so you'll be cleared of your charge.

956
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:22,409
I'm the one
who couldn't protect her.

957
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:25,420
So don't feel guilty anymore.

958
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:29,250
I'll take all the blame with me.

959
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,520
Yoon Hee.

960
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,800
Yoon Hee. What are you thinking?

961
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:42,529
Yoon Hee.

962
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,978
Yoon Hee is missing?

963
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:54,309
What do you mean?

964
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:56,710
I can't reach her.
And her phone is off.

965
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,390
Doesn't she know yet
that Ro Na is alive?

966
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,649
I didn't tell her yet.

967
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,460
What if...

968
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:09,189
she does something drastic?

969
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,828
She wouldn't. Definitely not.

970
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:15,969
Su Ryeon. Su Ryeon.

971
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:18,170
(VIP Patient Room)

972
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:22,539
Yoon Hee.

973
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:29,880
Yoon Hee.

974
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:37,250
Where are you?

975
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,420
You can finally see her again.

976
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,090
Why are you doing this?
You're scaring me.

977
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,130
Yoon Hee.

978
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,210
(To Su Ryeon)

979
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,710
To Su Ryeon.

980
01:12:05,949 --> 01:12:09,920
I've committed a sin against you
that cannot be cleansed.

981
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:14,560
No words or actions
can bring me forgiveness.

982
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,369
Why did I...

983
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:26,640
decide to do that back then?

984
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,079
If I hadn't done
such a horrible thing,

985
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,920
Dan Tae never would've
thought of killing you...

986
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,750
and Ro Na wouldn't have died.

987
01:12:47,619 --> 01:12:49,430
(Bae Ro Na)

988
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,100
Not here either.

989
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,699
I've missed you so much.

990
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,529
I loved you,

991
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:31,470
and that's why I resented you
and felt bad for you all the more.

992
01:13:48,619 --> 01:13:50,689
I'll take my punishment.

993
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:53,489
Here's my last act...

994
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:56,090
of forgiveness for you.

995
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:58,029
Goodbye.

996
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,720
Yoon Hee...

997
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:05,858
(The Penthouse 2)

998
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:06,859
Abandoning a corpse?

999
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:09,028
You killed Seol A's dad,
pushed Seol A to the edge,

1000
01:15:09,029 --> 01:15:10,068
and killed Na Ae Gyo.

1001
01:15:10,069 --> 01:15:13,099
Assemblyman Lee Kyu Jin is here!

1002
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,038
- Ma Ri!
- I heard you have a real name.

1003
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:16,169
So we meet.

1004
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,639
- I can do it alone.
- Seok Kyung is offering to help.

1005
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,778
- Are you proposing?
- Are you really back in Korea?

1006
01:15:20,779 --> 01:15:22,549
Her dad is a very scary man.

1007
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,618
- Get me out of here right now.
- That's too bad.

1008
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:26,349
Until your misfortune reaches
its height...

1009
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:28,149
I hope you die a painful death.
