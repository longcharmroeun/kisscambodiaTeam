00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,939
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,020
You're here.

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,760
What are you doing?
Why are you here?

4
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:57,220
What are you doing
with all the lights off?

5
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,965
Is Ms. Jin not here?

6
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,419
Don't turn the lights on.

7
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:09,400
I can't wait any longer.

8
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,200
Seok Hoon, let me know
that you love me tonight.

9
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:17,769
What do you think you're doing?

10
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,855
Joo Seok Hoon!
How can you leave like that?

11
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,679
What do you think you're doing?

12
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,125
Our contract states
that we study together...

13
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:28,825
and share our tutor. That's all.

14
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,649
If you're going to be like this,

15
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,690
let's not study together anymore.

16
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,959
Don't ever call me here again.

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,000
Just promise me one thing.

18
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,200
That you won't fall for Ro Na.

19
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,170
Ro Na and I...

20
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,110
are not together anymore.

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,940
It's old news.

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,380
- Did I keep you waiting for long?
- No, I came early.

23
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,089
I got the wine recommended.
Do you want the same one?

24
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:36,290
Sounds good.

25
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,489
How's the hotel? I rented it
for a long time.

26
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:44,700
You can come
whenever you need a break.

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,236
Even better if you want
to come with me.

28
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,200
Thank you. What a surprise.

29
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:52,969
The view is amazing
and this is so cozy.

30
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,070
There's one more surprise.

31
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,749
Come.

32
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,875
What is it?

33
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,676
You seemed to like
Designer Baek's dresses,

34
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,399
so I got a few custom-made ones.

35
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:25,516
You can wear them
to your performances this year.

36
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,969
I'll get you new dresses next year.

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,480
Why aren't you looking?

38
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,890
What do you think? Do you like them?

39
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:49,330
Yes, they're beautiful.

40
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:57,369
Why don't you wear this one
for the luncheon?

41
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,070
I put special care into
customizing this one.

42
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,339
I'm so touched.

43
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,350
When did you prepare all of this?

44
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,749
I'm happy that you're happy.

45
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:15,565
Shall we throw a toast?

46
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,260
We can relax and drink
until tomorrow.

47
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,760
What should I do?

48
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,889
I think I should get going.

49
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,206
What do you mean?

50
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,059
My mom...

51
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,129
says that she isn't feeling well.
I can't shake her off my mind.

52
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,800
Is she not feeling very well?

53
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,069
That's why you seem so anxious.

54
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,770
You're shaking right now.

55
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,179
I don't think it's anything serious.

56
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,626
I need to go.

57
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,179
Okay. Let's go.

58
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:59,605
You look pale. I'll give you a lift.

59
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,900
No. I can drive myself.

60
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,040
I'll get going then.

61
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,600
Let me know how Mother's doing.

62
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,239
Did you come back? To see me?

63
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,725
What are you up to?
What do you want?

64
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,225
How did you know I was here?

65
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:52,355
Did you follow me?

66
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:53,679
Calm down.

67
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,196
I wondered why you came back.

68
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,696
It was obvious...

69
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,266
that conniving witch Yoon Hee
was using you to get back at me.

70
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,566
Do you not see that
or are you pretending not to?

71
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,076
Let me talk first.

72
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,569
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,845
That's why you brought Yoon Hee...

74
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,516
and her daughter to provoke me.

75
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,345
Do you think that will work?

76
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:15,446
Do you really think...

77
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,610
I'll leave everything I have
and go back to you?

78
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:21,610
That is so you, Yoon Chul.

79
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:26,749
Did you just laugh?

80
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,970
Sure. That would be fun,

81
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,829
if I'm putting on an act
just to get you back.

82
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,239
But sorry.

83
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,110
I feel bad for disappointing you
and for your wild imagination,

84
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,439
but I love Yoon Hee.

85
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,379
I guess it really bothered you
that I came back.

86
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,879
I thought you were happy
with Joo Dan Tae,

87
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,790
but I guess not.

88
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,460
Just tell me why you're here
at this hotel.

89
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,720
Why did you do that to me
in New York?

90
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,929
What do you mean?

91
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,530
I don't remember anything.

92
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:16,730
- Even now?
- What's wrong with you?

93
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,179
I had a meeting at the hotel,

94
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,679
and I saw you in the lobby.

95
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,249
I wanted to confirm...

96
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,850
whether New York was a mistake.

97
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,449
And I did confirm
that it was a mistake.

98
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,650
That's all.

99
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,230
Your feelings for Yoon Hee are real.

100
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:47,076
You expect me to believe that?

101
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,699
I don't care if you don't.

102
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,530
What's for sure is,

103
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,670
you are no longer in my heart.

104
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,509
So please be careful from now on.

105
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,710
That jerk.

106
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:05,879
Don't show your face again
if you don't want to die.

107
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,679
That's what I want as well.

108
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,819
(Get lost murderer)

109
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,849
You're just a murderer's daughter.

110
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,120
I'll make you pay, Ro Na.

111
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,319
Hey! What are you doing here?

112
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,099
Did you do this?

113
00:08:55,729 --> 00:08:57,900
Just look the other way...

114
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,069
unless you're with the murderer.

115
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,915
That... That rude brat.
Look at how she talks to an adult.

116
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:07,939
(Get lost murderer)

117
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,636
Why are you home so late?

118
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,800
Did you hide treasure
in Min Hyuk's home or something?

119
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,370
Something like that.

120
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:34,170
Why are you still up?

121
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,640
I waited up to talk to you.

122
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,516
Can it wait until tomorrow?

123
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,349
I had a drink, so I'm sleepy.

124
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,420
What is it?

125
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,535
Never mind.
I'll tell you another time.

126
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,195
Okay. Sorry.

127
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,459
I'm going to bed then, okay?

128
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:59,030
- I love you, princess.
- Me too.

129
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,045
- What is it?
- Ro Na came back to the school.

130
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,780
Ms. Cheon re-enrolled her.

131
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,756
She permitted her re-enrollment.

132
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,285
Ro Na is a murderer's daughter.

133
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,155
It drives me mad already
living in the same building,

134
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,795
but I have to go to
the same school too?

135
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,750
If you have time
to get upset like this,

136
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,819
why don't you prepare
for Cheong A Art Festival?

137
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:29,630
Other kids can get in
by their talent, but you...

138
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,429
Forget Seoul University of Music.
You can't get into...

139
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:35,369
any decent college in Seoul without
the principal's recommendation.

140
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,476
You're a moron who can't
even take the midterms...

141
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,770
unless I get you
the answer sheet ahead of time.

142
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,309
You don't expect me to buy
the CSAT answer sheet, do you?

143
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,209
What will you give me...

144
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,410
if I win the grand prize trophy?

145
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,620
Anything you want.

146
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,626
- I want to move out.
- Move out?

147
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,059
Living with Eun Byeol makes me sick.

148
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,459
I want to move out
once I get into college.

149
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,260
I have an apartment
in my name anyway.

150
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
You'll move out.

151
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,599
Fine.

152
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,315
I'll think about it
if you bring home the trophy.

153
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,609
I promise.

154
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,140
I'll do whatever it takes...

155
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:21,849
to bring home
the Cheong A Art Festival trophy.

156
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,300
Is this how you were being treated?

157
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,469
You came back for this?

158
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,800
I won't change my mind.

159
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,839
Go back to the US.

160
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Don't even think
about moving in here.

161
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:52,709
I'm...

162
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,856
going to live here.

163
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,449
Says who?

164
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,109
I told her to come.

165
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,750
What are you thinking?

166
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,520
Come in, Ro Na.

167
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,290
You must be tired.

168
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,859
I got your room ready. Come in.
Watch your step.

169
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,050
Let's do our best.

170
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,520
Remember there's always someone
on your side whenever you look back.

171
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,750
I'll always cheer you on. Mr. Ha.

172
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,339
(Bae Ro Na's re-enrollment
has been approved.)

173
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,010
Did you ever meet Seol A?

174
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:04,979
No.

175
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,880
Not even once.

176
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,020
Mr. Lee.

177
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,420
My mom...

178
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:19,059
did that to Seol A because of me.

179
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,370
I kept throwing a tantrum
and bugged my mom every day...

180
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:24,900
that I wanted to go
to Cheong A Arts High School.

181
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:27,740
So...

182
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:30,439
please hate me.

183
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:33,609
Please don't hate my mom too much.

184
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,719
Whenever I saw you at Cheong A,

185
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,520
I was reminded of Seol A.

186
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:48,459
She sang very well like you.

187
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,630
Singing was her dream.

188
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:58,170
The first day she met Cheon Seo Jin,
she called me.

189
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,370
Anna Lee, correct?

190
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:05,479
Yes. Please just call me "Anna".

191
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,155
I met Ms. Cheon Seo Jin
for the first time,

192
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,410
and I was so nervous
that my mind went blank.

193
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,020
So I didn't get to say
the stuff I had prepared.

194
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,120
That I'm her huge fan.

195
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,736
She was much more beautiful
in person,

196
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,059
so I must've been in shock.

197
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:23,035
I saw a photo of her singing,

198
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,359
and my heart pounded so hard.

199
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,500
I suddenly
desperately wanted to sing.

200
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:32,370
I imagined learning under her
at Cheong A,

201
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,870
and singing a beautiful song
on stage.

202
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,640
And win Cheong A Art Festival's
Grand Prize trophy.

203
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,479
Just by imagining those things,
I became so happy.

204
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,150
If I had a mother,

205
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,679
would I have been able to sing?

206
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,260
(Bae Ro Na)

207
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,429
Seol A.

208
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,630
I'll make your dream come true
on your behalf.

209
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,170
I'll win Cheong A Art Festival's
Grand Prize trophy...

210
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,069
no matter what.

211
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:08,740
After that,

212
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:13,079
I'll never sing again.

213
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,055
What are you talking about?

214
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,185
She should, of course,
come back home.

215
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,479
She's too young
to be in the US alone.

216
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,726
So you signed
a parent consent form...

217
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,496
without talking to me first?

218
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,589
Ro Na contacted me directly
and asked me. I couldn't say no.

219
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,866
Yoon Hee, why are you against it?

220
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,030
I really don't understand you.

221
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,160
Ro Na can't be here.

222
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,770
Don't you know what kind of place
Cheong A Arts High School is?

223
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,376
Cheon Seo Jin won't leave her alone.

224
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,069
Don't worry about that.

225
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,839
Ro Na.

226
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,040
I just got a text saying
that I've been re-enrolled.

227
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,780
I'm going to school.

228
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,449
Ro Na, wait for me.

229
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,189
I'm going to work.
Don't skip breakfast.

230
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,260
- Wait...
- Ro Na!

231
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,459
Ro Na.

232
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,660
Let's go.

233
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,370
Ro Na, here.
You didn't have breakfast, right?

234
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,939
Thank you.

235
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:17,809
Thank you for the necklace too.

236
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,609
I like it.

237
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,949
- Mr. Ha.
- Yes?

238
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,719
Be nice to my mom.

239
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,650
I want at least you...

240
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,390
to be nice to her.

241
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:38,760
Ro Na, wait for me.

242
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,040
This is so annoying.

243
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:54,309
Come to my office. It's urgent.

244
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,709
What's going on?
You said it was something urgent.

245
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:02,890
Do you remember Reporter
Son Hyung Jin of Simin Daily?

246
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,565
He's famous for his critical
articles about me.

247
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,466
Did he publish
another problematic story?

248
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,189
He just got in touch with me.

249
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,776
(Is Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin's
Wedding Called Off?)

250
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,016
(Rumors about Cheon Seo Jin's
Secret Lover)

251
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,280
Reporter Son is planning to publish
these articles today.

252
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:24,609
What happened?

253
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,609
Didn't you tell me you were going
to your mother last night?

254
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,010
Well, the thing is...

255
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,579
I went back to my room
to get my wallet...

256
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,295
and ran into someone on my way out.

257
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,895
It was someone I'd never met before.

258
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:41,659
He was drunk and tried to hit on me,
but I pushed him away and left.

259
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,936
These articles are
complete nonsense.

260
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,559
Do you expect me to believe that?

261
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,200
Since when do you
keep secrets from me?

262
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,716
You lied to me
and went to see another man.

263
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,676
Deny it if you can.

264
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,746
Who is he?
Who did you meet last night?

265
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,109
I already told you
that I don't know him!

266
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,555
Do I have to explain about
a drunk man who bumped into me?

267
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,379
You don't know him?

268
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,220
Secretary Cho, come in.

269
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,295
Who is the guy?

270
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,406
We're still trying to find out
because the pictures are blurry.

271
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,766
- Did you contact the hotel?
- I asked for the CCTV footage,

272
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,599
but they refused
for privacy reasons.

273
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,016
Instead of giving me
such a lame answer,

274
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,809
go find him right now!

275
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:33,216
The word must have
already leaked out.

276
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,780
Our stock plummeted today.

277
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:37,885
I'll give you an hour.

278
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,196
Bring him in front of me.

279
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,450
Stop!

280
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,190
Secretary Cho, you may leave.

281
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,960
I already denied it.

282
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,375
Shouldn't you believe
whatever I say?

283
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:57,545
I can't sort this out
unless you tell me the truth.

284
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,740
That leech would do whatever
to publish those articles.

285
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:02,585
But we should at least
try to make a deal.

286
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,016
That's not necessary.
I can take care of it.

287
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,756
The situation is
not to be underestimated.

288
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,440
I said I can take care of it.

289
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,319
You're lashing out without giving me
a chance to explain.

290
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:14,220
I don't like it.

291
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,819
I have to get back to school.

292
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,770
Pick up, Yoon Chul.

293
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,839
Pick up, you jerk.

294
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,280
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

295
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,849
Eun Byeol.

296
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:54,889
Did you know?

297
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,135
Don't your mom have
more power than this?

298
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:59,305
Is she really so weak
that she had to re-enroll Ro Na?

299
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:01,835
Watch your mouth.
I'm just as annoyed as you are.

300
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:04,869
We all have one more
competitor now, you idiot.

301
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,669
Can you do as I say?

302
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,480
We have to kick that girl
out of this school.

303
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,280
You and I are a team now.

304
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,766
How about we fight together...

305
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,020
against our shared enemy?

306
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,329
Why didn't you pick up...

307
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,569
You're here.
Why are you out of breath?

308
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,510
Is it something urgent?

309
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,656
What are you doing here?

310
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,280
Back to our conversation.

311
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:53,379
I'm waiting for your answer.

312
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:56,190
Who did I meet last night?

313
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,835
Why do you want to know that?

314
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,859
Just answer my question.

315
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,105
The man in these pictures
is you, right?

316
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:07,035
That's a rather strange question.

317
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,770
To me, it sounds like
you already know the answer.

318
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,839
Yes, I did meet Seo Jin.

319
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,186
Do you expect your fiancee to report
everything she does to you?

320
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,785
It was late.

321
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,956
And you were at a hotel.

322
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,050
We just ran into each other
by chance.

323
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,419
Don't you think these pictures
look a little contrived?

324
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,649
Don't tell me
you're doubting Seo Jin.

325
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,659
Is everything all right
between you two?

326
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,260
That's it.

327
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,930
You got your answer, so leave.
You've humiliated me enough.

328
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,329
Maybe I should have just walked
past my ex-wife without saying hi.

329
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,030
My bad.

330
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:46,970
It must be tough for you.

331
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,345
Having to deal with
such an oversensitive fiance.

332
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:51,946
In today's world,

333
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,540
even silly rumors can
cause stocks to crash.

334
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,180
Are you sure
that rumors are to blame?

335
00:21:58,379 --> 00:21:59,795
Is your company all right?

336
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,149
Ha Yoon Chul.

337
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,290
I'm sorry if I was out of line.

338
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,649
I said that out of concern.

339
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,169
I lied to him because I didn't want
him to get the wrong idea.

340
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,079
Anyway, thank you.

341
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,210
Reporter Son Hyung Jin
of Simin Daily, right?

342
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,379
I'll explain to him.

343
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,419
I didn't do this for you.
It was for Eun Byeol.

344
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,690
We can't hurt her again
with things between you and me.

345
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,200
Mr. Ha, everyone is waiting. Do you
want me to cancel the meeting?

346
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,500
No. Let them in.

347
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:57,339
From now on, I don't want us
to meet privately.

348
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,280
Yoon Hee wouldn't like it.

349
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:01,540
Well then.

350
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:16,605
You couldn't trust me?

351
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,300
You made me apologize to Yoon Chul
for your behavior!

352
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,476
I thought our relationship
was more than this.

353
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,045
You should have told me
that you met Ha Yoon Chul.

354
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:27,315
Why did you have to complicate
things by lying?

355
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,716
It's because you overreact
to everything.

356
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,240
I didn't want to fight.

357
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,849
It was to protect you.

358
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:40,180
I had to stop
such ridiculous rumors.

359
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,149
Legally, we have nothing
to do with each other.

360
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,619
Disappoint me again, and I'll...

361
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:51,129
seriously reconsider
our relationship.

362
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:54,399

This is the last time
you can get cute with me.

366
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,899
Did your daughter get back safely?

367
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,270
You knew that Ro Na was
back in Korea.

368
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,540
Why didn't you tell me?

369
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:39,609
It was Logan's order
to not tell anyone.

370
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,240
You said you'd protect Ro Na.

371
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,450
You promised you wouldn't
let her near Korea.

372
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:49,389
Didn't you also break your promise?

373
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,550
What do you mean?

374
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,559
Logan must've told you...

375
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,460
to find Seok Kyung's birth mother.

376
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,700
How can I find someone...

377
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,359
who even you guys couldn't find?

378
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:05,500
You should've approached
Joo Dan Tae.

379
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,740
He'd know where she is.

380
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,210
Why are you looking
for Seok Kyung's birth mother?

381
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,909
You'll find out...

382
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,550
when we find her.

384
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,240
I guess the scandal was quite a hit.

like he's quite shaken.

Well...

390
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,599

I separate you two.

Since it's a school event that will
help with college admissions,

400
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,609
I'm going to make sure...

401
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,680
that every part of the process is...

402
00:26:57,109 --> 00:26:59,409
done completely fairly.

403
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,696
The preliminary round will have
two students pair up...

404
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,595

I guess so.

It's me, Ma Doo Ki.

You took care of it well, right?

436
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,996
As requested, Eun Byeol and Ro Na
are in the same group together,

437
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,026
meaning that one of them
will get eliminated.

438
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,295
That's one less rival
for Seok Kyung.

439
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,966
There's a chance that Eun Byeol
might get eliminated?

440
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,875
That's right, sir!

441
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,676
Also, I've already talked...

442

that you've received so far.

456

Must be because
your mother is a murderer.

The case is already closed!

458

459
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,869
and the real murderer was caught.

460
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,006

Is this...

465
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,950
because you feel sorry for your mom?

to your mom?

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,906
It wouldn't be fair to wait
for them any longer.

536
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,045
By default, why don't we pass...

537
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:35,970
Seok Kyung and Eun Byeol instead?

538
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,970
- What?
- Nice!

539
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,280
I guess we have no choice.

540
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:45,510
We'll eliminate Yoo Jenny
and Bae Ro Na.

541
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:48,620
Joo Seok Kyung and Ha Eun Byeol are
going to the next round.

542
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:54,819
I'm here.

543
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,689
I'm not late, am I?

544
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:04,129
That's too bad. Time's up.

545
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:06,105
You've just been eliminated.

546
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:07,740
Please let me sing.

547
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,616
It's not over yet.

548
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,209
Being on time is the key in tests.

549
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:15,039
This is a consequence
of not being on time.

550
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,355
Accept it.

551
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:19,379
Someone locked me in the bathroom...

552
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,780
on purpose.

553
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,749
Who would do that?

554
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,335
Joo Seok Kyung, Ha Eun Byeol.

555
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,136
Why did you do that? Tell me.

556
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,830
Were you that insecure
about your singing?

557
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,999
Were you that scared about me
going to the finals?

558
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,039
Bae Ro Na! What are you doing?

559
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,145
I won't give you a chance
just because you do this.

560
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:45,939
I'm serious. Please believe me.

561
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,915
How can you prove it?

562
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,709
Jenny was with me.

563
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,749
Jenny is a witness.

564
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,795
She's lying!

565
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,450
What's happening?

566
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:59,966
Ro Na said that we should pretend
to be locked in the bathroom...

567
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,765
because we can't beat the girls
with our skills,

568
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:04,560
and that we have to
frame them as bullies...

569
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,560
to go to the finals.

570
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,269
She locked me in the bathroom
and didn't let me out.

571
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,539
Did you plot
all of this on your own?

572
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:19,109
Ro Na, are you insane?

573
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,709
Jenny, why are you doing this?

574
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:35,060
Are you done?

575
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,089
Yes.

576
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,200
Jenny, we are
in the same group, right?

577
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,875
How can you be so unlucky?

578
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:46,839
I guess your ticket
to the finals is already gone.

579
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,045
You're not going to try hard...

580
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:52,209
to beat me, are you?

581
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,585
Don't be scared.

582
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:57,749
We're here to help you.

583
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,379
There's one way that you can
make it to the finals.

584
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:04,665
What is it?

585
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,036
Just prove to us...

586
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,589
that you're our friend, not Ro Na's.

587
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,236
Then, you'll make it to the finals,

588
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,100
and you won't be bullied.

589
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,399
We can let you
into the SNU Club too.

590
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:19,569
What do you think?

591
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,946
Ro Na! Are you
seriously that dirty?

592
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,280
How can you plot all of this
even if this is important?

593
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,986
What a terrible person you are.

594
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,749
Yoo Jenny.
Are you speaking the truth?

595
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,649
Can we count on your words?

596
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,689
Yes, you can.

597
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,089
No, she's lying.

598
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:45,660
I didn't do such a thing.

599
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,930
I was the one who was locked.
I'm the victim here!

600
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,176
Mr. Ma, with the authority
as the Director,

601
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,039
I'll send Bae Ro Na
to the disciplinary committee.

602
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,569
Any insulting behavior
against Cheong A Arts Festival...

603
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:00,379
cannot be forgiven.

604
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,716
Please punish her...

605
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,479
according to the school's rules.

606
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:13,796
Go and tell them
that I didn't do it.

607
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,519
That they made you do this.

608
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,590
Were you in on their plot too?

609
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:22,130
Were you one of them all along?

610
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:25,800
Why? Why can't I be?

611
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,869
Do you know what I've been through
because of you?

612
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:31,970
I've been bullied and cursed at
instead of you!

613
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,169
Just because I bought you
some bread.

614
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,039
Just because I said that I feel
sorry for you once!

615
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,209
So, shouldn't you
take one for me too?

616
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,019
I have to make it
to Seoul National University...

617
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:49,189
as I've been through so much for it.

618
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:53,860
College is the only way
out of this nightmare.

619
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:55,289
So,

620
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,475
you're saying that it's okay for me
to be expelled again?

621
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:00,369
I was never a kind person.

622
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,530
Get up.

623
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,999
When did you come?

624
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:39,769
I watched everything
that happened to you and Jenny.

625
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,479
I know you hate me,

626
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:50,479
but you need my help right now.

627
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,990
I'll make sure that you can
still attend this school.

628
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,535
A bully?

629
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,006
Min Hyuk is the one with
the broken arm here.

630
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,236
How dare they blame him?

631
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,636
Nonsense!

632
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,336
Ro Na's mom is a lunatic.

633
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,475
That's not the important thing.

634
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:08,506
Because of Ro Na,

635
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,075
my Jenny got eliminated from
the preliminaries. How can it be?

636
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:14,570
We need to have a parents' meeting
and make sure they suffer.

637
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,010
A bully?

638
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:31,990
You!

639
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,435
You should've just quietly
backed off if you were insecure.

640
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:36,030
Why did you bring
my innocent Jenny into this?

641
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,099
You got my Jenny eliminated too.
What are you going to do?

642
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:42,046
How dare you come back here...

643
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,200
and ruin everything?

644
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:46,245
I didn't do anything!

645
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,486
Calm down.

646
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,256
We're going to get blamed
if you keep acting out.

647
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,979
How can I calm down?

648
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:55,856
"Participated in the finals
of the Cheong A Arts Festival."

649
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,955
You know how important that is
for student records.

650
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:02,466
This girl stripped
that chance away from Jenny!

651
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,265
Jenny is resilient.

652
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:07,490
She can do well on the CSAT
and still go to college.

653
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:13,229
Ms. Cheon, please give
Jenny a chance.

654
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,446
She was unfairly stripped
of her chance.

655
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,915
Shouldn't you give her a chance?

656
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:20,970
Do you even care about Jenny?

657
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,439
What is she saying?

658
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,086
Are you still insane?

659
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,455
Tell them the truth!

660
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,419
Get your hands off of my daughter!

661
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,090
Ro Na!

662
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:38,196
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

663
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,136
How can an adult do that to a child?

664
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,130
Don't you realize that
this is abuse?

665
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,329
How can all of you just sit
and watch child abuse happen?

666
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:49,229
If you lay a finger on
our Ro Na one more time,

667
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,840
I'm going to sue you all.

668
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,645
You sure love law enforcement.

669
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:55,785
But...

670
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:58,785
you can't deny the law of genetics.

671
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:02,380
A criminal mom bred a bully.
This is just great.

672
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,495
This is why I say
the family matters.

673
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,395
You nobodies with no roots.

674
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:09,189
Shut your mouth!

675
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,696
Hit me.
If you want to end up in jail.

676
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,559
That will suit you right.

677
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,990
That's enough!

678
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,630
Please act accordingly
with the prestige of Hera Palace.

679
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,176
Everyone take your seat.

680
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,599
Seriously.

681
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,880
Ro Na. Who are the school's bullies?

682
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:38,550
Joo Seok Kyung.

683
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,419
Lee Min Hyuk.

684
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,919
And Ha Eun Byeol.

685
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,360
What?

686
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,535
Do you have proof
that you were assaulted?

687
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:52,075
She has no proof.

688
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:55,145
She's making it all up
so she doesn't get expelled.

689
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:58,300
That's what you call
making a false accusation.

690
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:02,010
Do you know how serious it is
to make a false accusation?

691
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:06,415
My daughter is here as a victim,
not as an assailant.

692
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:09,026
Shouldn't you listen
to the victim first?

693
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,579
(Director Cheon Seo Jin)

694
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,979
Ro Na. Go on, tell them.

695
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,519
Today, Joo Seok Kyung filled
a bucket with water and paint...

696
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:18,289
and poured it on me.

697
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,506
While I was washing up,

698
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,650
she intentionally locked me
and Jenny in the bathroom.

699
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:27,130
Ro Na. Your dream must be
to become a novelist.

700
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,475
Ha Eun Byeol and
Lee Min Hyuk watched on,

701
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:32,276
but they did nothing to stop her.

702
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,515
No one saw it
and no one said they did it.

703
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:35,970
Why should we believe you?

704
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,285
It's your word against theirs.

705
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:41,110
The kids are lying.

706
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:44,479
If the assailants deny it,

707
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,095
is there no victim?

708
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,426
Ma'am. You can't believe
just what your child says...

709
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,966
and post such a serious lie...

710
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,606
on the Office of Education website.

711
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,365
Post a correction
and apologize officially.

712
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:59,636
If you don't, be prepared
to face a criminal charge.

713
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,800
The school isn't interested at all
in uncovering the truth anyway.

714
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:05,939
Also,

715
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,955
the disciplinary committee
has already decided...

716
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:13,455
to forcibly transfer Bae Ro Na for
tainting the image of the school...

717
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,880
and trying to turn students
against each other.

718
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,055
As all the teachers have consented,

719
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:21,550
we will process it expeditiously.

720
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:23,189
I understand.

721
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:26,559
If you insist on denying it,
you give me no choice.

722
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,300
I will submit a formal complaint
with the Office of Education.

723
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:37,475
Are you mad?

724
00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:39,046
You're not calling anyone!

725
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:41,086
Are you trying to keep our kids
from going to college?

726
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,645
- Let go.
- You should apologize.

727
00:44:42,669 --> 00:44:43,816
How shameless!

728
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,185
- How dare you touch her?
- Is this why you came?

729
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:48,685
Honey! Call the cops on her!

730
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:50,820
Fine! Tell the Office of Education!

731
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:53,426
I'll tell the reporters...

732
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,825
- and take this up officially.
- Get off.

733
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:57,595
You jerk.

734
00:44:57,619 --> 00:44:59,066
How dare you threaten us?

735
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,459
Stop it, Mom!

736
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:04,705
Jenny! I'm glad you're here.

737
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:07,176
Tell them everything she did to you.

738
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,606
Make this brat stop lying.

739
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,070
She's not lying.

740
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:13,240
What Ro Na said...

741
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,139
was all true.

742
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:18,610
What?

743
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,196
What? Are you saying
Min Hyuk is a bully?

744
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,966
You'd better think carefully
before you speak.

745
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,959
Did... Did Ro Na threaten you?

746
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,196
You little witch.

747
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,265
What did you do
to my innocent daughter?

748
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:38,160
I said to stop!

749
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:42,430
I'm the one who was bullied!

750
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:46,400
For a year, I was beaten up
and cursed at.

751
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,510
I'm the one who was bullied.

752
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:55,309
I'm an outcast just like Ro Na.

753
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,880
You don't know anything!
So stop it!

754
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,050
Outcast?

755
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,660
What do you mean? Why?

756
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,689
Why were you bullied?

757
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,050
- Oh my gosh.
- Goodness.

758
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,959
What... What's wrong with your hair?

759
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:39,559
How long has it been this way?

760
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,930
How long has it been?

761
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:46,860
Who was it?

762
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,740
Who did this to you?

763
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:55,669
Who was it?

764
00:46:56,669 --> 00:46:58,979
Who did this to my daughter?

765
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:00,709
Tell me!

766
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:09,749
This is Jenny's medical record
I got from the hospital today.

767
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:11,959
She has suffered from...

768
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,990
stress-induced hair loss
and reflux esophagitis for a while.

769
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:36,586
Jenny won't betray us, will she?

770
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,696
Definitely not.

771
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,325
She has to do as we say...

772
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:41,395
if she wants to compete
at Cheong A Art Festival.

773
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:43,095
What's the point in making it
to the festival?

774
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,995
She won't win anyway.

775
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:47,430
Isn't it better to frame her
as Ro Na's accomplice?

776
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,705
How dare she try to go to
Seoul University of Music?

777
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:53,160
Darn it. This is a secret.

778
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:57,769
You know Jenny's mom lied
about going to Ehwa University.

779
00:47:58,599 --> 00:47:59,700
For real?

780
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,369
My mom's the alumni chair
of Ewha's School of Communication.

781
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:04,055
She looked into it,

782
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,986
and Jenny's mom wasn't on the list
of Home Economics grads.

783
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,110
Did she lie about her education?

784
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:13,889
No wonder.
She was so obviously ignorant.

785
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,220
Even the way she speaks is so cheap.

786
00:48:16,689 --> 00:48:18,535
She's a total outcast
in Hera Palace, isn't she?

787
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,360
That's why she was close to Ro Na.
Birds of a feather.

788
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,200
Birds of a feather flock together.
It's scientifically proven.

789
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:28,676
Maybe her designer bags
are knockoffs.

790
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,539
It must be so hard to act rich
when they're poor.

791
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,619
Will you just keep being bullied?

792
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:51,090
Let go of me.

793
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,535
I've reported it
to the Office of Education...

794
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:55,630
that you were assaulted
by school bullies.

795
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,360
So you should let it out too.

796
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,700
Why did you do it?

797
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:03,305
Who gave you the right?

798
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:05,615
I said I didn't want to. I said no!

799
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:07,669
At least your mom needs to know.

800
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:10,010
If she finds out later,

801
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:12,780
she'll feel worse
and even more heartbroken.

802
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:28,329
I personally recorded this today.

803
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:43,410
What was that?

804
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:51,380
Ro Na did nothing wrong.

805
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,950
I lied.

806
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,760
My gosh.

807
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,999
We'll post this...

808
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:10,639
on the Office of
Education's website...

809
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,570
as evidence of school violence.

810
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:26,055
Seok Kyung. What were you thinking?
How could you do this?

811
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,825
A bully at Cheong A?

812
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:29,919
Do you know how serious this is?

813
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,860
Sorry.

814
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,229
I got too upset.

815
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,070
No. Seok Kyung was wrong.

816
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,816
I think Ro Na's family
is determined.

817
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,185
They already reported it
to the Office of Education.

818
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:49,669
The investigators
will come tomorrow.

819
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,555
If what happened to Jenny
gets out too,

820
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:53,180
things will blow up
to be much worse.

821
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:56,209
Sorry. You'll have to
fix this for us.

822
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,356
Apologize to her this instant!

823
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,820
I only did as Eun Byeol told me.

824
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:05,019
I may be the only one in the video,
but Eun Byeol was next to me.

825
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:08,705
It was her idea to throw
the paint on her...

826
00:51:08,729 --> 00:51:10,636
and to lock her in the bathroom.

827
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,935
It's the truth.

828
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:14,599
Putting the blame on
Eun Byeol is going too far.

829
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,999
I'm disappointed.

830
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,539
I heard you did it although
Eun Byeol tried to stop you.

831
00:51:20,939 --> 00:51:23,615
Did she say that?
That she tried to stop me?

832
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:25,915
That's what all the kids said.

833
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:28,486
That you led the bullying
of Jenny too.

834
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,756
Eun Byeol brought all the foods...

835
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,780
that we fed Jenny.

836
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,419
Why are you only protecting her?

837
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:38,419
I see.
She gets preferential treatment.

838
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:40,136
You said we were family.

839
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,506
Was it all a lie?

840
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,836
That's enough!

841
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,400
You should repent!
How dare you accuse her?

842
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:48,369
Why don't you believe me?

843
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:55,209
She weaseled out by herself?

844
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,639
Ha Eun Byeol.

845
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,225
Be careful until you get into
the Seoul National University.

846
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:03,510
This is the most crucial time.

847
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,455
With school violence
in your student record,

848
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:07,849
you'll have to forget
about early admission.

849
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,889
Get your act together.

850
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,860
An assemblyman's son shouldn't
get involved in school violence.

851
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:14,305
Lie low from now on...

852
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:16,760
and pin everything on Seok Kyung.

853
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:18,336
Answer me.

854
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,400
Gosh, I know how to handle it.

855
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:24,570
Who is it at this hour?

856
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:31,579
Who is it?

857
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,240
Oh, my.

858
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,880
What's wrong?

859
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,650
- Ms. Kang, what are you doing?
- Give that to me.

860
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:44,466
What's going on? Why are you
taking away my son's phone?

861
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,019
- Start.
- Let's go.

862
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,760
- What are you waiting for?
- Drink it.

863
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:52,636
You look the prettiest
when you're drinking soda.

864
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,070
Drink faster.

865
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:05,055
Ms. Kang, you're scaring me.

866
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:06,680
Get off me!

867
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,780
Ms. Kang, calm down.

868
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,590
Think of our friendship.

869
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,395
You need to calm down.

870
00:53:17,419 --> 00:53:19,636
Kids fight all the time.

871
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,329
It's not a big deal.

872
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,729
Shut it, you jerk.

873
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:35,970
What...

874
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,579
Is she out of her mind?

875
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,749
Gosh, I was so close
to capturing the castle.

876
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,780
This is not okay.

877
00:53:48,689 --> 00:53:52,535
That woman is out of line.

878
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,059
Seok Kyung! Open the door!

879
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:57,336
- Open it!
- What's wrong, ma'am?

880
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,935
- Calm down.
- Get out of my way!

881
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:00,705
- Where is Seok Kyung?
- Please calm down.

882
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:02,345
- Ma'am.
- Move.

883
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:04,915
- Seok Kyung! Where is she?
- Calm down, ma'am.

884
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:06,840
- Get off me.
- Ma'am.

885
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:08,586
I said, get off me!

886
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,910
What's going on? It's still early.

887
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:17,150
How can you be sleeping?
Go apologize to Jenny right now.

888
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:21,050
Why? I didn't do anything wrong.

889
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:24,559
She is the one who betrayed me
and sided with Ro Na.

890
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,389
- That turncoat.
- Shut it, Seok Kyung!

891
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,860
Have you lost your mind?

892
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:35,106
Who gives you the right to hit me?
Who do you think you are?

893
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,676
Does that hurt?
Get your act together.

894
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,539
I can't put up with you anymore.

895
00:54:39,669 --> 00:54:41,446
At least pretend to be sorry,

896
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,915
or I'll blow up
the whole penthouse, okay?

897
00:54:43,939 --> 00:54:45,910
What is going on here?

898
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,119
You need to raise
your daughter better, Mr. Joo.

899
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,189
Are you lecturing me now?

900
00:55:00,419 --> 00:55:01,836
Are you in the position to?

901
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,260
I won't let this slide.

902
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,400
I'll make sure she can't enter
Cheong A Art Festival...

903
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,106
and is punished,

904
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,705
whether she is expelled
or transferred.

905
00:55:10,729 --> 00:55:13,939
You want the daughter of the head
of operations transferred?

906
00:55:14,669 --> 00:55:16,169
I don't think that's possible.

907
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,780
Our contract ended today.

908
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,026
We're even.

909
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,749
I don't owe you anything anymore.

910
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,895
Do you want me to reveal
what you did to my husband,

911
00:55:31,919 --> 00:55:34,236
which you tried to cover up...

912
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,935
by giving me an apartment?

913
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:39,136
I don't think it's a good idea
to bring that up, Ms. Kang.

914
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,400
It was for Jenny's sake
that my husband took the fall...

915
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,769
and went to prison instead of you.

916
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:47,939
To give our daughter a good life.

917
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:51,240
And your daughter
ripped her heart to pieces.

918
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:54,039
Nothing can stop me now.

919
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,079
I don't know how far I'll go.

920
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:00,050
Be prepared. I might even...

921
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:03,590
kill your daughter, Seok Kyung.

922
00:56:04,289 --> 00:56:05,860
You're out of your mind.

923
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:19,200
What? Do you think
it serves me right?

924
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,669
I know you think it's only fair.

925
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,939
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

926
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:28,050
Yes.

927
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,849
I wonder if you finally
understand me.

928
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:34,095
What?

929
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:36,389
When your child is bullied,

930
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,889
you become
so frustrated and upset...

931
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:40,865
that your body shakes...

932
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:43,130
and your blood boils.

933
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,599
You can neither sleep...

934
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:48,169

935
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:52,200
You want to destroy everyone.

936
00:56:54,439 --> 00:56:57,470
You can't understand it
until you've experienced it.

937
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:00,539
I've been there.

938
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,510
I'm being punished now, right?

939
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:07,820
Because of me, Ro Na was called
by the school violence committee.

940
00:57:08,849 --> 00:57:11,395
I hit, insulted,

941
00:57:11,419 --> 00:57:13,419
and bullied the innocent girl.

942
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,530
I'm being punished for that now.

943
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,800
I've been a terrible parent.

944
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:31,180

on protecting Jenny.

952
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:19,189
I'm sorry, Ms. Oh.
