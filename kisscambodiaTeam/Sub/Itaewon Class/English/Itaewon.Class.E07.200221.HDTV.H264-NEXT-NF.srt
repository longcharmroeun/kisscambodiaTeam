<i>So your goal is my doom.</i>

00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:35,792
<i>It's funny I'm feeling this way</i>

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,503

8
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:43,508
Hello. Welcome to DanBam.

9
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:02,694
I wanted to see you.

10
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:07,490
I really wanted to meet you too.

11
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,501
BOSS PARK SAEROYI

12
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:20,962
Yes.

13
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:22,797
EPISODE 7

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,425
-What would you like to order?
-What would you recommend?

15
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,843
The squid is good,

16
00:01:26,926 --> 00:01:29,345
so you should try
our mussel soup with squid.

17
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,014
-I see. Then we'll get this and...
-Okay.

18
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:33,182
Is there anything else you need?

19
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:35,018
A glass of iced water for me, please.

20
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:37,604
Sure. Your food will be out shortly.

21
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:38,605
-Thank you.
-No problem.

22
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:44,193
Are you ready to order, Mr. Chairman?

23
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,195
Do you know who I am?

24
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:49,157
Everyone in the restaurant industry knows
who you are.

25
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:54,912
I'd like a stew and a stir-fried dish.

26
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:57,665
Pick what you think is best.

27
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,084
And a bottle of soju as well.

28
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:02,629
One stew, one stir-fried dish,
and a bottle of soju.

29
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:04,172
Right away, sir.

30
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:15,933
What did he order?

31
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:17,977
A stew and a stir-fried dish.

32
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,896
He told me to pick the best one.

33
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,277
A stew and a stir-fried dish?

34
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,239
He's your dad. Do you know what he likes?

35
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:32,200
He tends to like salty, spicy foods.

36
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,204
Let's do stir-fried pork belly
with mung bean sprouts and soft tofu stew.

37
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,872
Yes, those are the best choices.

38
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,666
I'll have the cook put in extra seasoning.

39
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:41,209
No, don't.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,087
Listen, guys.

41
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:51,678
I don't want him to catch any flaws today.

42
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,097
So

43
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:58,851
just do what you normally do.

44
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:00,603
-Okay.
-Okay.

45
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:08,152
Excuse me.

46
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,115
Have you lost your mind?

47
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:15,368
-What are you doing here?
-I'm working, as you can see.

48
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:18,121
Exactly. Why the hell are you--

49
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:19,122
Enough.

50
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,042
You don't belong here.

51
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,215
Where do I belong?

52
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:35,888
Is Jangga

53
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:38,683
where I belong?

54
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,773
I'm here to eat.

55
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:48,067
We'll talk another time.

56
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:55,700
Enjoy your food.

57
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:00,705
JANG GEUN-SOO

58
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:08,171
Boss.

59
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:10,923
-Yes?
-The stove.

60
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:19,724
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

61
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,400
Enjoy.

62
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:30,860
Hey.

63
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,072
I noticed you bought our stock.

64
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,283
What?

65
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,496
It's a blue-chip stock.

66
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:44,290
-I thought it'd be a good investment.
-No.

67
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:46,334
I'm talking about

68
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,420
when our stock price plummeted
eight years ago.

69
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,803
You invested over 100 million won.

70
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:01,098
It was probably money
from Mr. Park's insurance. You invested

71
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,977
all of that money in Jangga,
which was collapsing?

72
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:06,604
Why?

73
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:11,317
Because I believed in it.

74
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:16,989
You believed in it?

75
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,409
The brand image might have been tarnished,

76
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,328
but Jangga's core values...

77
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,956
Its brand essence didn't change.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,253
I thought it'd be
a good long-term investment.

79
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,299
So it was just for the profits?

80
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:37,051
What else would it be for?

81
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:45,101
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

82
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:49,313
What's the investment of this morning
supposed to mean?

83
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:52,775
This morning?

84
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,527
You invested about 600 million won.

85
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:57,613
What? 600 million?

86
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:02,827
You invested that much?

87
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:08,207
What are you trying to do?

88
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:14,630
I guess

89
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:19,051
you're bothered about me.

90
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:25,474
I did it for the same reason.

91
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:32,440
You're not a good liar.

92
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:37,213
Here you go, sir.

93
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:40,216
To be honest, I had high expectations.

94
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,303
I'm saying this because
I've now tasted the food here.

95
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:47,556
No matter what you're thinking,
you can't beat Jangga.

96
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,893
Just be grateful

97
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:54,230
that I don't consider you my enemy.

98
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:01,737
I'm saying this because of Mr. Park.

99
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:15,167
Give up and take it easy.

100
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:22,091
-Let's go.
-Okay, Dad.

101
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:28,222
"Give up and take it easy"?

102
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:34,770
I can't, sir.

103
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:40,067
Being stubborn

104
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:41,944
and foolish

105
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:44,572
and my life itself...

106
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:03,049
You know I will keep fighting
so let me tell you again.

107
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:09,513
It may be a slow process,
but I am doing things step by step.

108
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:12,725
And you are my end goal.

109
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,813
Are you out of your mind? Know your place.

110
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,065
You!

111
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:29,742
Keep your mouth shut.

112
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,671
Because of my father?

113
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:45,633
Don't kid yourself.

114
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:49,303
The only thing you can do
for my late father

115
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,848
is getting on your knees
and paying for what you did.

116
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,227
And I'll make that happen.

117
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:14,578
A stubborn fool is now even bluffing.
What a joke.

118
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,040
You deserve a beating.

119
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,376
I'm not just bluffing.

120
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:23,420
Do you know this?

121
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:25,965
Tigers don't growl or roar.

122
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:27,883
They just chew you to pieces.

123
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,098
I'll soon teach you what that means.

124
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:41,856
Goodbye!

125
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:44,775
Thank you for visiting DanBam!

126
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,351
DANBAM

127
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:21,687
DANBAM

128
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,943
You're actually looking that up?

129
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:31,572
Tigers do roar, of course.

130
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:32,615
I know.

131
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:34,992
They roar so loudly.

132
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:39,121
He's obviously never seen a tiger
in his life. That old man bullshitted me.

133
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:41,582
He was implying
that he will trample all over you.

134
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,626
I won't be fazed by it.

135
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:47,046
You should've kept your cool.
You're no match for him, after all.

136
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:49,298
That's not how you start a fight.

137
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,843
He'll think I'm a kid
who can't even control his anger.

138
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,888
I want him to think that.

139
00:11:57,348 --> 00:12:00,017
-What?
-He'll try to walk all over me,

140
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,561
but that was bound to happen.

141
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:06,148
Now that he thinks I'm just
a clueless kid, he won't go all out.

142
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,527
What are you talking about?

143
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,739
<i>Chairman Jang came by. Can we meet now?</i>

144
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,033
A fight

145
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:18,202
is all about the first punch.

146
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,329
And you throw the first punch

147
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:24,583
behind the back.

148
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,051
<i>Sure.</i>

149
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,734
<i>I'm here to see one of your inmates.</i>

150
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:53,529
Here's a visiting application.

151
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,948
Fill it out and wait a few minutes.

152
00:12:57,574 --> 00:13:01,287
NAME OF INMATE YOU WISH TO VISIT:
PARK SAEROYI

153
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:06,375
RELATIONSHIP

154
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:10,629
<i>Hey, 2127. You have a visitor.</i>

155
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,093
Hey.

156
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:25,811
What's up?

157
00:13:26,478 --> 00:13:27,688
I'm curious about something.

158
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:31,025
Curious? About what?

159
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:34,695
Why did you

160
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:36,989
hit Jang Geun-won that day?

161
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:39,491
I just couldn't stand him.

162
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:43,996
-You don't need to thank me--
-I don't need to thank you?

163
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,582
Don't be delusional.
You were just being nosy.

164
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:48,834
That's not how you fight.

165
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:52,046
I was fighting against him in my own way,
by enduring and holding out.

166
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:55,674
And you ended up behind bars
because you couldn't control your temper.

167
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,603
Why are you all prickly?

168
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:12,483
Well, you are right.

169
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,693
But don't be such a know-it-all.

170
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:18,614
There are times when you're faced
with things that you just can't tolerate.

171
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:23,952
You should leave if you're finished.

172
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:26,163
What will you do?

173
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:28,665
Any plans after getting out?

174
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,292
Well,

175
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:32,336
I don't really want to tell you.

176
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:34,463
I find you obnoxious.

177
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:44,807
I got into Business Administration
at Hanguk University.

178
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,185
I achieved it
by going through hell for three years.

179
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,104
I see.

180
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:53,440
It'll be good
if you can forget everything.

181
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:55,734
That's great.

182
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:58,904
Can you?

183
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:03,659
Can you put everything behind and move on?

184
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:10,416
It's just something
those who have never been bullied say.

185
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,669
Don't you know that I hate white milk?

186
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,212
Tell me.

187
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:17,381
Look at me.

188
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:21,093
Still to this day, Jang Geun-won shows up
in my dreams and wakes me up at night.

189
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:24,805
I've gone up to the roof countless times
in the middle of the night, to die.

190
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:28,934
I don't really know how to comfort--

191
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:30,811
Three years is a long time.

192
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:33,439
What got me through that hell

193
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,279
was my goal to get my revenge.

194
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,747
I want to be an asset manager.

195
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,293
It's like a fund manager.

196
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:57,671
First off,

197
00:15:58,255 --> 00:15:59,965
I admit that I'm a little twisted.

198
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,676
That's why I lied earlier.

199
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,137
To be honest,

200
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:07,639
I wanted to thank you.

201
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,601
For helping me.

202
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,274
I plan to open a pub

203
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:19,026
when I get out.

204
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:22,738
I want to succeed in the food industry

205
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:25,616
and take Jangga down.

206
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:32,122
That's my goal.

207
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,045
It won't be easy though.

208
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:40,255
-I never thought it'd be--
-It'll be hard.

209
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:49,306
Unless you work with a fund manager
who knows what he's doing.

210
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:03,695
What's your name?

211
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:08,158
Lee Ho-jin.

212
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:12,412
I'm Park Saeroyi.

213
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:14,581
Ho-jin.

214
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:19,169
Do you want to be my ally?

215
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:29,304
That's why I came to see you.

216
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:42,109
RELATIONSHIP: FRIEND

217
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:51,952
1.9 billion won in Jangga.

218
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:54,580
It was a bit of an impulsive move.

219
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,167
If we waited for about a year, it would've
gone up by 500 million won more.

220
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:01,169
Why didn't you stop me?

221
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,716
What about you?
I was still in school seven years ago.

222
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,801
Why did you trust me with it?

223
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:12,264
Why ask now? You did a good job
of growing my money.

224
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:16,101
But that money
was your dad's death benefit.

225
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:18,979
I know nothing about stocks.

226
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:20,689
That's why a professional fund manager--

227
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:23,609
I know nothing about stocks,
but I know you.

228
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,654
You said those three years were like hell.

229
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,867
You endured and held out
throughout that grueling fight

230
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,286
and got into the best university.

231
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:36,955
You're stubborn and tenacious.

232
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:46,757
You say that and make me do
all sorts of shit.

233
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:49,384
What?

234
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,136
Kang Min-jung.

235
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:54,181
Thinking about that
still makes me shudder.

236
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:01,855
The last time I saw you was
at Mr. Park's funeral, right?

237
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:04,858
I should be happy to see you,

238
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:07,027
but I'm quite upset.

239
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:12,032
Did you order Ho-jin
to deliberately approach me?

240
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,577
I apologize if it upset you.

241
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,164
I heard about
what the chairman did to you.

242
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:22,668
You see, I was fond of Mr. Park,
and I admired him.

243
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:26,672
But unfortunately, I'm not motivated
by things like sympathy and compassion.

244
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:31,635
I heard Ho-jin has helped you

245
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,179
double your money.

246
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:35,972
So?

247
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:39,226
And I heard you want Jangga to do well
more than anybody else does.

248
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,769
And?

249
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:44,856
I'd like to support you.

250
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:49,444
How?

251
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:55,492
If a shareholders' meeting were to be held
sometime in the future, that is.

252
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:04,167
You must've gauged the scope
of Ho-jin's abilities by now.

253
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,670
Yes, he's very capable.

254
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:07,713
But what about you?

255
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:10,924
You worked hard for seven years
and opened a pub, I heard.

256
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,008
It's impressive.

257
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,386
Mr. Park would be so proud of you.

258
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:16,388
But you see,

259
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:18,223
this is a whole different ball game.

260
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:22,477
Even if you sell your precious business
that's worth a few hundred million won,

261
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:25,564
you can only buy under one percent share
of Jangga Co. Do you realize that?

262
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:32,112
There's nothing you can do to support me.

263
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:37,701
What if I come to own
one percent share of Jangga Co.?

264
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:41,830
One percent?

265
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,875
The total value of Jangga's shares
exceeds 200 billion won.

266
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,753
One percent of that is two billion won.

267
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:51,047
Kiddie, you'll never get to touch
that kind of money.

268
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:53,675
And truthfully,
even that won't really be a big help.

269
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:57,387
But it'll be a great way to test me.

270
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:00,891
If I pull it off, you'll know that
you shouldn't underestimate me.

271
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,270
And even if it's not a big help,
it'll still be helpful for you.

272
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:11,151
And I'd like you to know

273
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,571
that I don't have to have you
join hands with me.

274
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:17,282
Saeroyi.

275
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:29,169
You're talking as if you already have
what you haven't even acquired.

276
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:31,755
That's how I've lived so far.

277
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:35,592
What do you want from me?

278
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:40,430
You're the second-biggest shareholder,
following Chairman Jang.

279
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:44,059
-So what?
-You've known Geun-won for many years.

280
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,561
Can he really lead Jangga Co.?

281
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,525
Jangga Co. led by Jang Geun-won.

282
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:55,570
-Will it succeed and thrive?
-What are you trying to say?

283
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:56,696
Jangga Co.

284
00:21:57,656 --> 00:21:59,032
should be led by you.

285
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,663
When the dismissal of Chairman Jang
is brought up,

286
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,749
I will be by your side.

287
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,483
You said the chairman is your enemy.

288
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:35,485
Yes.

289
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,404
Revenge...

290
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,031
What do you think he thinks of you?

291
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:42,409
You're like a fruit fly to him.

292
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:48,623
I mean, look at you bluffing
just because you now own a small pub.

293
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,253
Your brazen bluff won't get me excited

294
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:55,505
because I like peace.

295
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:09,352
I suppose I'm talking
to the wrong person, then.

296
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:15,817
Sorry to bother you.

297
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,236
-Saeroyi.
-However,

298
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:25,160
you are Mr. Park's son, so maybe

299
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:28,038
I should give you
the benefit of the doubt.

300
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:36,463
What I trust more than your words
and my discerning eye

301
00:23:37,672 --> 00:23:38,924
is Chairman Jang's intuition.

302
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:41,009
Your pub... DanBam, did you say?

303
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:43,803
Yes.

304
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,932
Jea Foods, Hyeonil Foods,
Soso Brothers, and so on.

305
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:47,933
Do you know about them?

306
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,268
They're top restaurant companies.

307
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:52,228
Chairman Jang eats at their restaurants.

308
00:23:52,312 --> 00:23:55,774
One percent, two billion won.
That's very ambitious of you,

309
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:59,527
but you can't persuade me
with such numbers.

310
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:08,244
Make him dine at your tiny pub.

311
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:10,163
That's your mission.

312
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:17,879
If you prove to me
that you can get on his nerves,

313
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:23,969
<i>then I'll put my trust in you.</i>

314
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:27,806
I wanted to see you.

315
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:30,850
<i>I can see</i>

316
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:33,311
<i>his back.</i>

317
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:37,190
I really wanted to meet you too.

318
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,122
You've accomplished your mission.

319
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:55,291
-I owe it all to you.
-It was a lucky move.

320
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:59,254
He wouldn't even have glanced at you
if you didn't put in the investment.

321
00:25:01,756 --> 00:25:05,135
He came because I was the one
who made the investment.

322
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:08,179
You do have a point.

323
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:11,182
You withdrew from other investments
and bought more Jangga stock.

324
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,769
Doesn't that mean
you've already made up your mind?

325
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:16,021
Hey.

326
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,606
Yes.

327
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:21,026
Don't people call you obnoxious?

328
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:27,157
No, never.

329
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,867
You can be a little obnoxious.

330
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:32,871
Maybe that's your charm.

331
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:36,708
Fine.

332
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,378
Shall we join hands?

333
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:44,007
-Then--
-Yes.

334
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:47,343
Together, we'll take down
Chairman Jang and Geun-won.

335
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,804
Let's do it.

336
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:54,851
I look forward to it, partner.

337
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:03,526
Likewise.

338
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,453
Did you ask me to stop by just to play go?

339
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:18,500
I felt like I've been neglecting you.

340
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:22,587
I'm over 40 now.
You don't need to look after me.

341
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:25,340
You're so cold.

342
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:27,675
I'm getting old,

343
00:26:28,593 --> 00:26:31,930
so I'm not as energetic as I used to be.
I have many worries.

344
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:35,225
Maybe I don't have
that much time left to live.

345
00:26:35,517 --> 00:26:38,436
I think about Bo-hyeon, your father,
often these days.

346
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:44,609
You're still healthy. You'll live long.

347
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,530
I've lived long enough,
so I don't have many regrets.

348
00:26:49,155 --> 00:26:50,907
But I'm worried about the company
after I die.

349
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:53,576
I don't know if I can leave it
in Geun-won's hands.

350
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:04,212
The latest trend is hiring
a competent management specialist.

351
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,217
It's not easy for me to say this,

352
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:14,264
but I hope you don't feel obligated
to pass it on to your son.

353
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:18,852
Even internally, there are many employees
who are more capable than Geun-won.

354
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:22,438
The company's continued success
should be our top priority, you know.

355
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,401
Then I suppose...

356
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:30,321
You will be

357
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:33,950
most suited for the position.

358
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:44,419
I lost.

359
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:48,506
I see that you're now on par with me.

360
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:50,717
It was a good game.

361
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:52,594
You should stay for lunch.

362
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:55,597
I have to meet someone.
Please invite me again another time.

363
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:00,185
Min-jung.

364
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:05,356
You're like family to me.
I'm very fond of you.

365
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:10,195
And as the chairman of Jangga Co.,

366
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:13,281
I'm always grateful for how much
you care about the company.

367
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:22,874
You're the only one I trust,
so keep up the great work.

368
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:27,545
I always trust you and do as you say, sir.

369
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:56,491
It looked like they had met before.

370
00:28:58,326 --> 00:28:59,619
This is quite hurtful.

371
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,793
What a pity.

372
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:16,761
<i>His relationship with Jangga Co.</i>

373
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:20,014
<i>It may look like</i>

374
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:23,351
<i>he's a show-off and a narcissist.</i>

375
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:25,853
<i>But those stocks...</i>

376
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:27,313
<i>And the first punch?</i>

377
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:32,360
<i>He had planned all this eight years ago.</i>

378
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:36,197
<i>The fight I have no idea about.</i>

379
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:39,534
<i>And it's getting really annoying.</i>

380
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,622
Hey, Ho-jin. No, I'm not busy.

381
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:46,040
Your office?

382
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,084
I'll be right there.

383
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:53,548
I need to go somewhere.

384
00:29:54,757 --> 00:29:55,633
Where?

385
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:01,306
-I need to meet someone.
-Can't I go with you?

386
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:04,642
-You don't even know what it's about.
-What is it about?

387
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:12,400
Geun-soo, clean up
and go home with Yi-seo.

388
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,484
Okay.

389
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:32,420
Do you even know what kind of relationship
your brother has with him?

390
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:39,510
Yi-seo.

391
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:42,430
You know what happened

392
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:45,058
between Saeroyi and my family, don't you?

393
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:50,188
No, I don't.

394
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:52,398
Really?

395
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:55,693
I really don't know.

396
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:01,240
Yes, you do.

397
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:03,284
What is it?

398
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:05,078
Are you deaf?

399
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:07,330
I told you that I don't know.

400
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:10,500
Why the fuck are you asking me
about your family?

401
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:14,462
What's going on?

402
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:16,381
What's the matter?

403
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:21,886
Mind your own business.

404
00:31:23,763 --> 00:31:26,808
What am I going to do with that rude brat?

405
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:30,144
I only asked her one question!

406
00:31:31,145 --> 00:31:32,146
My gosh.

407
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:39,153
STOCK OWNERSHIP RATIO
OF CHAIRMAN JANG'S PEOPLE

408
00:31:45,618 --> 00:31:48,413
I think we made a move a bit too early.

409
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:50,248
Why?

410
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:54,794
There are those who support the chairman
and those who support Ms. Kang like us.

411
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,422
And when it comes
to the stock ownership ratio,

412
00:31:58,714 --> 00:32:00,800
we own about 12 percent less than they do.

413
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:04,429
Many people in the company
have a lot of trust in Chairman Jang.

414
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:10,184
Then we should make him lose their trust.

415
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:14,147
-How?
-You know what I'm talking about.

416
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:17,733
The detective?

417
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:19,569
Do you think it'll work?

418
00:32:19,652 --> 00:32:21,529
Doesn't he still ignore you
every time you visit?

419
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:25,032
I'll just have to keep trying.

420
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:31,456
JANGGA PUB TARGETS CHINA
TO BE THEIR NEXT MARKET

421
00:32:33,624 --> 00:32:34,625
You asked for me?

422
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,798
<i>The Best Pub.</i>

423
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:43,801
Why did you pay them money?

424
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:47,722
They should be paying us instead.

425
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:52,310
This?

426
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:56,022
Saeroyi wanted to be on the show as well.

427
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:58,149
So I paid them to kick him off the show.

428
00:32:58,232 --> 00:32:59,484
Why would you do that?

429
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:02,403
Pardon?

430
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,489
Well...

431
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:07,408
I didn't want to risk
losing the competition...

432
00:33:11,412 --> 00:33:13,498
This is why people think
you're incompetent.

433
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:15,583
You fool.

434
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:18,294
Sorry?

435
00:33:18,377 --> 00:33:21,964
By doing that, you just admitted
that he's better than us.

436
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,511
Why can't you be more sophisticated?

437
00:33:30,723 --> 00:33:31,974
I'm sorry.

438
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:33,809
Get out of here.

439
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:45,696
My successor.

440
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:47,990
Lack of competence.

441
00:33:52,954 --> 00:33:55,331
I can never talk to that old man.

442
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:01,546
Hey.

443
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:04,966
What do you think you're doing here?

444
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,725
-Am I not allowed to be here?
-What was that, you jerk?

445
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:17,186
Dad asked me to come.

446
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:22,567
Why?

447
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:29,782
Why did he ask you to come?

448
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:35,496
Are you nervous?

449
00:34:36,998 --> 00:34:38,249
You must be fucking crazy.

450
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:49,260
You haven't hit me in ages, brother.

451
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:51,304
What?

452
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:53,347
"Brother"?

453
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:56,267
I didn't get why you hit me
when I was little.

454
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:00,271
But I guess you were just nervous.

455
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:03,774
You must've lost your mind.

456
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:14,327
Don't get so scared.

457
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:16,912
I'm not even interested.

458
00:35:27,465 --> 00:35:28,758
Damn it.

459
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:53,491
What happened to your face?

460
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:56,577
You always asked me that when I was young.

461
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:01,874
FOREIGN STUDIES EDUCATION CONSULTING

462
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:04,293
Study abroad
and meet your mom while you're there.

463
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:09,799
What kind of relationship

464
00:36:11,217 --> 00:36:12,510
do you have with Saeroyi?

465
00:36:13,594 --> 00:36:16,263
I only came to ask you that.

466
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:19,475
As you've already seen,

467
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:22,061
we don't have
a very amicable relationship.

468
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,354
What's the reason

469
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:24,772
for that?

470
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:28,067
Why are you asking me

471
00:36:29,026 --> 00:36:30,861
instead of asking him?

472
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:34,573
Because I'm scared.

473
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:37,952
-You're scared?
-Because the atrocious side

474
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:41,038
is probably our family.

475
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:46,377
Don't worry.

476
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,462
I'm not the bad guy.

477
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:54,552
Here's my favorite idiom.

478
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:57,555
<i>"The strong prey on the weak."</i>

479
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:00,516
"The strong prey on the weak."

480
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:03,394
Who do you think decides

481
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:06,605
good side or the bad side?

482
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:09,191
The winner gets to decide.

483
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:11,819
And I always win.

484
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:18,868
A carp that's raised in a fishbowl

485
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:22,079
only grows as big as your hand.

486
00:37:24,665 --> 00:37:26,959
But a carp that lives in a river

487
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:30,379
grows up to over 1m.

488
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:32,214
-I'm--
-Did you move out

489
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:33,799
only to be a waiter at a small pub?

490
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:37,052
You're my son.

491
00:37:37,762 --> 00:37:41,891
You may be an illegitimate son,
but I won't let you live a useless life.

492
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:50,232
-I'm going to leave.
-I want you to quit--

493
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:51,400
Listen!

494
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:04,288
I don't want to live like you.

495
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:11,712
I'll be off now.

496
00:38:15,424 --> 00:38:16,383
And one more thing.

497
00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:21,138
I don't know what happened
between you two.

498
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:27,520
But are you really sure

499
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:30,815
that DanBam is a small fishbowl?

500
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,068
What?

501
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:37,404
Saeroyi

502
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:41,784
is a lot stronger than you think.

503
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:38,215
I told you.

504
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:39,800
Don't worry about me.

505
00:39:40,384 --> 00:39:42,344
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

506
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,267
So that you won't suffer,

507
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:50,311
I'll...

508
00:39:51,395 --> 00:39:52,855
destroy Jangga Co.

509
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:02,072
WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?

510
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:04,450
Call Saeroyi.

511
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:08,370
<i>Calling Saeroyi.</i>

512
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:33,646
Did

513
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:35,648
something bad happen?

514
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:38,984
What? No.

515
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,821
You?

516
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:45,115
No, me neither.

517
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:51,372
How did you save up all that money?

518
00:40:52,414 --> 00:40:53,248
What?

519
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:57,419
It's a secret.

520
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:00,130
Is it because I work at Jangga Co.?

521
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:03,258
No, that's not why.

522
00:41:04,635 --> 00:41:06,553
I just don't want you to get involved

523
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:09,431
in this fight
between me and Chairman Jang.

524
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,225
Whatever.

525
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:13,560
You already got me involved.

526
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:21,318
Sometimes,

527
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:24,113
I get confused.

528
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,243
I know I work at Jangga Co.

529
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,413
And I always do my best for the company.

530
00:41:33,038 --> 00:41:36,500
But when you told me
that you'll make me quit,

531
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:39,586
it made me really happy.

532
00:41:44,383 --> 00:41:46,885
I sometimes wish you'd stop this fight,

533
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:48,762
but then I find myself rooting for you.

534
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,640
As I stand between you and Jangga Co.,

535
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,934
I don't know what to do

536
00:41:54,727 --> 00:41:56,687
or whose side I'm on.

537
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:02,359
It sounds weird
now that I've said it out loud.

538
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:04,903
I feel so two-faced.

539
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:15,497
Did I ever tell you why I like you?

540
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:17,624
What?

541
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,294
Remember back in high school?

542
00:42:20,377 --> 00:42:22,379
You were late
to your university interview,

543
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:25,382
so you ran all the way there.

544
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:27,051
Oh, right.

545
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:30,262
You told me that you didn't need my help,

546
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:32,931
and you persistently ran
the entire way there.

547
00:42:34,016 --> 00:42:35,809
In the end, you got there in time.

548
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,687
And as I saw you going inside from behind,

549
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:40,522
I could sense

550
00:42:41,356 --> 00:42:44,359
that you were
an incredibly independent person

551
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,196
who knew how to take care of yourself.

552
00:42:51,116 --> 00:42:52,201
I was impressed.

553
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:00,918
Don't get swayed.

554
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,213
You don't need to be on anyone's side
but your own.

555
00:43:09,843 --> 00:43:11,011
Okay.

556
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:16,433
DANBAM

557
00:43:16,517 --> 00:43:17,768
Hello.

558
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,444
Hello.

559
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:21,113
Hello.

560
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:24,399
Toni, you can greet them.

561
00:43:24,483 --> 00:43:25,400
Okay.

562
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:26,944
Hello.

563
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:28,821
Welcome to DanBam.

564
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:31,665
What time do you guys close?

565
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:34,084
I'm full.
So, we just wanna grab some drinks.

566
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,127
If that's okay?

567
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:36,920
Where should we sit?

568
00:43:48,423 --> 00:43:49,883
I don't understand what he's saying.

569
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:51,969
What?

570
00:43:52,553 --> 00:43:54,263
Isn't he speaking English?

571
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:55,722
Hurry up and talk to him.

572
00:43:59,977 --> 00:44:01,270
I don't speak English.

573
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:04,940
Well...

574
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:08,277
Then who does?

575
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:13,699
Why? Why can't you speak English
when you look like

576
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:15,075
someone that would?

577
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:17,411
Because I'm Korean.

578
00:44:19,454 --> 00:44:21,665
But it's only been a year
since you came to Korea.

579
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:23,709
Where were you before that?

580
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:24,835
Guinea.

581
00:44:25,711 --> 00:44:27,754
So I'm fluent in French.

582
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:28,964
I see.

583
00:44:31,884 --> 00:44:34,469
Yi-seo will flip out if she finds out.

584
00:44:34,553 --> 00:44:37,097
She's going to fire you for sure.

585
00:44:49,443 --> 00:44:51,028
Do you like Saeroyi?

586
00:44:57,242 --> 00:44:58,368
I'm just curious.

587
00:44:59,203 --> 00:45:00,787
It's already weird that you gave up

588
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,789
going to university
just to work at DanBam.

589
00:45:07,127 --> 00:45:08,670
What if I do like him?

590
00:45:15,802 --> 00:45:17,137
It doesn't matter, right?

591
00:45:18,805 --> 00:45:19,681
What do you mean?

592
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:23,101
I know you like me.

593
00:45:28,732 --> 00:45:30,817
But you probably never

594
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:33,362
even thought of dating me
in the first place.

595
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:36,865
Do you know something?

596
00:45:37,783 --> 00:45:40,494
I was friendly to you
because I knew your family is rich.

597
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:44,665
I figured you'd eventually
be an asset to me.

598
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:50,087
But in the end,
you just turned out be a loser

599
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:54,716
who had no balls to go after me
or the company.

600
00:46:00,764 --> 00:46:02,099
You're talking nonsense.

601
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:05,602
You're probably satisfied
with what you have.

602
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:08,981
You want to know if I like Saeroyi?

603
00:46:12,484 --> 00:46:13,443
Yes, I do.

604
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:17,406
But it's not like I'm crazy about him.

605
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:21,368
Emotions are shallow and inconsistent.

606
00:46:21,952 --> 00:46:23,620
They change according to the situation.

607
00:46:32,045 --> 00:46:34,131
That means you've still got a shot.

608
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:36,425
What?

609
00:46:38,135 --> 00:46:39,469
By any chance...

610
00:46:40,178 --> 00:46:45,225
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

611
00:46:48,103 --> 00:46:51,481
you should take over Jangga Co.

612
00:46:58,655 --> 00:47:00,365
I'm kidding.

613
00:47:01,783 --> 00:47:02,743
Let's go.

614
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,380
She's so mean.

615
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:22,095
Toni.

616
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,682
Do you like working here?

617
00:47:26,475 --> 00:47:29,436
Yes, it's fun. I really like it.

618
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,191
Then learn

619
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:37,110
how to speak English.

620
00:47:37,194 --> 00:47:38,403
What?

621
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:40,280
English?

622
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,658
Hey, you're back early.

623
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:44,910
You're all here.

624
00:47:44,993 --> 00:47:46,536
Yes, well...

625
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:48,830
How did it go?

626
00:47:48,914 --> 00:47:51,750
We can't get the display stand.
But they agreed to give us an ice machine.

627
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,960
That's great.
I felt bad having to borrow it

628
00:47:54,044 --> 00:47:56,505
from the restaurant next door
every weekend.

629
00:47:56,922 --> 00:47:59,091
-Great work.
-You're going somewhere again?

630
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:00,384
Yes, I need to go.

631
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:02,302
What is it this time?

632
00:48:02,386 --> 00:48:04,096
It's something urgent. I'll be right back.

633
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,472
I'll see you guys.

634
00:48:05,555 --> 00:48:07,641
-Okay.
-Okay, see you.

635
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:13,230
Today's a weekday,
so you don't need me, right?

636
00:48:13,814 --> 00:48:15,065
What? Why?

637
00:48:22,072 --> 00:48:23,698
-I also need to go somewhere.
-Go ahead.

638
00:48:23,782 --> 00:48:25,409
Yes, we'll do fine without you.

639
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:26,868
-Thanks, you guys.
-Sure. Go on.

640
00:48:27,452 --> 00:48:29,287
Go ahead. Gosh, that was close.

641
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:38,130
By the way, what's going on
between our boss and Yi-seo?

642
00:48:38,213 --> 00:48:40,715
What do you think?
He's her boss, and she's the manager.

643
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:43,260
What's wrong? Do you sense something?

644
00:48:45,178 --> 00:48:46,596
It's hard to explain.

645
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,808
Forget that. You need to hurry up
and learn how to speak English.

646
00:48:50,058 --> 00:48:51,435
Get to your senses.

647
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:54,855
Yes, you should stay away from Yi-seo
for a while.

648
00:48:57,774 --> 00:48:58,817
Boss.

649
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:00,485
Boss!

650
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:05,574
What's the emergency?

651
00:49:05,907 --> 00:49:07,701
Isn't it about work?

652
00:49:07,784 --> 00:49:09,119
It's something personal.

653
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:11,204
You always make up things like that.

654
00:49:11,288 --> 00:49:13,540
You told me this before.

655
00:49:13,707 --> 00:49:15,125
It's hard to do it alone,

656
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,918
but you can do it because you have us.

657
00:49:17,544 --> 00:49:18,545
I don't know anything

658
00:49:18,628 --> 00:49:21,548
about the shares or the relationship
between Jangga and DanBam.

659
00:49:22,132 --> 00:49:23,925
Am I really the manager of DanBam?

660
00:49:24,134 --> 00:49:25,802
You said you needed me.

661
00:49:26,678 --> 00:49:28,472
Can you not trust me?

662
00:49:29,055 --> 00:49:30,432
I'm smart.

663
00:49:31,808 --> 00:49:34,186
I want to be supportive.

664
00:49:35,228 --> 00:49:38,064
Even if it's something personal,

665
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:40,358
you can share a little with me.

666
00:49:46,406 --> 00:49:50,035
It might have something to do
with work in a way.

667
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:52,996
It's quite far, and you might
feel uncomfortable there.

668
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:55,415
Do you want to come with me?

669
00:49:59,628 --> 00:50:00,712
I'd love to.

670
00:50:09,596 --> 00:50:11,932
FROM NAMBU TERMINAL TO PAJIN

671
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,228
It's a long story. And it's boring.

672
00:50:16,728 --> 00:50:19,439
It's okay. Tell me everything.

673
00:50:23,276 --> 00:50:24,861
When I was little,

674
00:50:26,196 --> 00:50:28,782
I lived alone with my dad.

675
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:31,952
<i>On the running bus,</i>

676
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:34,913
<i>he kept talking.</i>

677
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:38,792
<i>What his dad meant to him.</i>

678
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:42,754
<i>Jang Geun-won.</i>

679
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,632
I'll resign, sir.

680
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:47,717
Dad.

681
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:49,886
<i>The ill-fated relationship
with Chairman Jang.</i>

682
00:50:50,762 --> 00:50:53,223
<i>The death of his dad caused by them.</i>

683
00:50:54,558 --> 00:50:56,309
<i>Hidden truth.</i>

684
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,188
<i>The bottomless pit
he went through later on.</i>

685
00:51:02,524 --> 00:51:04,109
<i>His friend named Lee Ho-jin.</i>

686
00:51:04,651 --> 00:51:06,820
<i>His plans for revenge.</i>

687
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:10,031
<i>And the time he spent for his plans.</i>

688
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:12,784
<i>He kept telling me</i>

689
00:51:13,618 --> 00:51:15,537
<i>composedly and incessantly</i>

690
00:51:16,246 --> 00:51:18,206
<i>about what he's been through.</i>

691
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:22,210
<i>And I listened carefully.</i>

692
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,297
<i>I just listened.</i>

693
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:28,425
FROM NAMBU TERMINAL TO PAJIN

694
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:32,387
<i>Why did we come here?</i>

695
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:34,598
<i>To meet someone.</i>

696
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:37,684
Because it's winter.

697
00:51:38,977 --> 00:51:40,854
You should wear it for long in winter.

698
00:51:40,937 --> 00:51:43,356
Make sure to keep it clean.

699
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,236
It's been a long time.
Have you been doing well?

700
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,946
Saeroyi!

701
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:52,115
Hye-won.

702
00:51:52,699 --> 00:51:54,534
You've grown a lot.
Have you been doing well?

703
00:51:54,618 --> 00:51:55,827
Yes.

704
00:51:56,411 --> 00:51:58,663
What? Where are you going, Dad?

705
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:00,498
Dad.

706
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:04,127
Why do you keep coming
when he hates you like that?

707
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:07,380
Because I want him to take my side.

708
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:11,801
Help yourself.

709
00:52:12,552 --> 00:52:14,512
Take some if you need them.

710
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:18,475
Is he our supplier?

711
00:52:18,558 --> 00:52:21,728
Yes. These are what my dad prepared.

712
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:27,275
My pub is doing well thanks to you.

713
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:30,236
Gosh, you've finally achieved your dream.

714
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:33,490
This is just the beginning.

715
00:52:35,992 --> 00:52:38,286
What's your dream, Hye-won?

716
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:41,247
A cop. I want to be a cop.

717
00:52:51,424 --> 00:52:52,509
That sounds cool.

718
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,387
I also wanted to be a cop as a kid.

719
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:57,972
What? Why did you not become one?

720
00:52:58,056 --> 00:53:00,058
Hye-won. If you're done,

721
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:02,560
can you go gather up the laundry
before the sun sets?

722
00:53:03,853 --> 00:53:04,854
Okay.

723
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,197
Yi-seo, will you go help Hye-won?

724
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:16,366
Sure.

725
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:38,012
She seems brave and kind.

726
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:48,440
Unlike you, Officer Oh.

727
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:52,861
I'm not a cop anymore.

728
00:53:53,153 --> 00:53:54,738
Don't call me like that.

729
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:57,907
When I first met you,

730
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:01,661
you were a cop in charge of my dad's case.

731
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:04,497
Wake up, you punk.

732
00:54:05,248 --> 00:54:09,043
Get to your senses
if you want to keep your job.

733
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:14,966
Isn't your daughter
turning one next month?

734
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:18,511
Don't let that useless sense of justice
get the best of you.

735
00:54:19,095 --> 00:54:21,181
You should think about your family.

736
00:54:21,681 --> 00:54:24,893
Therefore, according to Article 254
of the Criminal Law, the defendant will be

737
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:28,188
sentenced to three years in prison.

738
00:54:31,983 --> 00:54:33,526
And you didn't finish the case yet.

739
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:53,546
I'm really sorry.

740
00:54:55,006 --> 00:54:57,759
Please stop...

741
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:02,931
Please stop coming here.

742
00:55:06,017 --> 00:55:07,101
Get up.

743
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:10,814
I will do anything.

744
00:55:11,314 --> 00:55:12,899
I'll do anything

745
00:55:13,566 --> 00:55:15,151
to make it up to you.

746
00:55:15,652 --> 00:55:17,654
I'll do anything you want.

747
00:55:17,987 --> 00:55:20,156
Whether it's tens or hundreds
of millions of won,

748
00:55:20,573 --> 00:55:23,159
I'll pay the money
no matter how long it takes.

749
00:55:23,243 --> 00:55:24,327
Make it up to me?

750
00:55:39,717 --> 00:55:41,052
The only thing

751
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:44,597
you can do for me

752
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:48,768
is turning yourself in
and revealing the truth.

753
00:55:53,606 --> 00:55:54,816
You should

754
00:55:55,483 --> 00:55:57,443
at least be an honorable dad

755
00:55:57,527 --> 00:55:59,904
who can support his daughter's dream.

756
00:55:59,988 --> 00:56:02,907
No. But it's just...

757
00:56:03,783 --> 00:56:06,119
Without me, Hye-won will...

758
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:07,328
I'm

759
00:56:08,663 --> 00:56:10,039
a businessman.

760
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:13,459
You should pay the price.

761
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,211
Don't try to welsh on your debt.

762
00:56:15,712 --> 00:56:17,297
But...

763
00:56:18,298 --> 00:56:19,549
You're not

764
00:56:22,135 --> 00:56:24,679
supposed to say that to me, right?

765
00:57:15,063 --> 00:57:17,398
If the guy gives testimony...

766
00:57:19,525 --> 00:57:20,401
What?

767
00:57:21,069 --> 00:57:23,279
Jang Geun-won will be put in prison,

768
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,075
and you will get the stockholders
on Chairman Jang's side on yours.

769
00:57:28,201 --> 00:57:29,869
Is that your plan?

770
00:57:33,623 --> 00:57:34,624
Did I wake you up?

771
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:38,086
So did it go well?

772
00:57:39,128 --> 00:57:40,004
No.

773
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:42,590
I knew it.

774
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,843
If he could be moved with compassion,

775
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:48,304
he wouldn't have carried
a false investigation.

776
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:51,015
We'll see.

777
00:58:13,913 --> 00:58:14,872
What are you doing?

778
00:58:14,956 --> 00:58:18,751
I can't sleep on the bare floor.

779
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,753
Just stay like this for a while.

780
00:58:29,595 --> 00:58:32,765
We should get going
before the last bus leaves.

781
00:58:41,357 --> 00:58:43,526
What is this scar?

782
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:47,530
I got hurt when I worked

783
00:58:48,322 --> 00:58:49,532
on the deep-sea fishing vessel.

784
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:54,871
And what about this one?

785
00:58:56,205 --> 00:58:57,582
When I did manual labor.

786
00:59:05,882 --> 00:59:08,760
You must've had a hard time all alone.

787
00:59:28,154 --> 00:59:29,155
A little.

788
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,541
What?

789
00:59:41,334 --> 00:59:43,211
<i>As I felt heartbroken</i>

790
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:45,838
<i>by his past...</i>

791
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:49,300
Why are you crying?

792
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,263
<i>I realized my feelings for him</i>

793
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:59,560
<i>was love.</i>

794
01:00:13,116 --> 01:00:15,660
<i>As I heard his calm voice,</i>

795
01:00:19,997 --> 01:00:21,791
<i>I got really emotional.</i>

796
01:00:23,626 --> 01:00:26,712
<i>I didn't want to let him
suffer alone ever again.</i>

797
01:00:28,631 --> 01:00:30,925
<i>I decided to kill</i>

798
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:33,886
<i>those who mess with this guy.</i>

799
01:00:58,995 --> 01:01:00,329
<i>I love him.</i>

800
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:06,377
<i>I really do.</i>

801
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:29,502
JANGGA'S TRIPE, JANGGA RAMEN

802
01:02:31,254 --> 01:02:32,630
The business is going well, right?

803
01:02:36,467 --> 01:02:38,886
This is the main street on the weekend.

804
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:40,179
It has to go well.

805
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:41,931
I guess you're right.

806
01:02:42,974 --> 01:02:44,183
Are you on your way to work?

807
01:02:44,267 --> 01:02:45,101
Yes.

808
01:02:45,893 --> 01:02:48,062
I was on my way to DanBam to get some ice.

809
01:02:48,145 --> 01:02:49,021
I'll come with you.

810
01:02:49,647 --> 01:02:51,899
How shameless you are.

811
01:02:52,483 --> 01:02:53,359
What?

812
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:57,154
I heard the whole thing from Mr. Park.

813
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:59,657
The relationship between Jangga and him.

814
01:03:02,576 --> 01:03:04,287
He rarely talks about himself.

815
01:03:04,996 --> 01:03:06,622
I guess he trusts you.

816
01:03:07,415 --> 01:03:10,751
Were you involved
in the stock purchasing too?

817
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:13,879
Why? So that you can go and tell them?

818
01:03:15,172 --> 01:03:16,549
I can tell you hate me.

819
01:03:17,133 --> 01:03:18,592
It's nothing surprising.

820
01:03:19,468 --> 01:03:22,179
Too bad. I don't hate you.

821
01:03:27,435 --> 01:03:28,811
Will you give me some ice?

822
01:03:30,563 --> 01:03:31,731
No.

823
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:37,611
Boss.

824
01:03:39,238 --> 01:03:40,072
You're here.

825
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,825
Why did you two come together?

826
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:45,578
I'm here to get some ice.

827
01:03:46,162 --> 01:03:48,164
Will you go in there and talk to Geun-soo?

828
01:03:53,377 --> 01:03:55,588
What's the matter?

829
01:03:57,006 --> 01:03:58,007
He's the building owner.

830
01:03:58,090 --> 01:03:59,467
Oh, hello.

831
01:04:00,051 --> 01:04:00,926
Hello.

832
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:04,013
Anyway, that's what's going to happen.

833
01:04:08,517 --> 01:04:10,019
What was it about?

834
01:04:22,281 --> 01:04:23,449
I can do that.

835
01:04:23,532 --> 01:04:25,493
No, it's okay.

836
01:04:29,163 --> 01:04:30,831
He sold the building.

837
01:04:30,915 --> 01:04:34,418
And the new building owner wants
to raise the rent.

838
01:04:35,211 --> 01:04:36,212
How much?

839
01:04:36,295 --> 01:04:37,296
By five percent.

840
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:39,965
Five percent? How much is it?

841
01:04:40,174 --> 01:04:41,884
How much would it be?

842
01:04:41,967 --> 01:04:45,596
The current rent is 5,940,000 won.
So 5 percent is...

843
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:47,723
It's 297,000 won.

844
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,769
That's just too much.

845
01:04:51,894 --> 01:04:55,064
I know. Isn't it a breach of contract?

846
01:04:55,731 --> 01:04:57,525
What's worse is that

847
01:04:58,275 --> 01:05:00,486
he wants us to move out
when the contract runs out.

848
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:02,446
-What?
-He wants to run his business here.

849
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,615
That's ridiculous.

850
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,536
When does the contract run out?

851
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:10,913
I took over the contract,
so it runs out in half a year.

852
01:05:12,081 --> 01:05:13,874
-Can I take a look at it?
-Sure.

853
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:17,628
There's no legal issue
about a rent increase.

854
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:20,381
They can raise it
by up to five percent every year.

855
01:05:20,965 --> 01:05:23,342
They are just like muggers.

856
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:26,846
Stop staring at me.

857
01:05:27,346 --> 01:05:28,681
Once our lease is up,

858
01:05:28,764 --> 01:05:30,766
do we have to move out?

859
01:05:31,183 --> 01:05:34,520
It doesn't say much about the conditions.

860
01:05:35,396 --> 01:05:37,898
If you ask him to renew
the contract, you can stay.

861
01:05:37,982 --> 01:05:39,900
It's unilateral termination
of the contract.

862
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:41,694
There's the law to protect the tenants.

863
01:05:41,777 --> 01:05:43,404
You can be protected for five years.

864
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:45,823
It's a good thing.

865
01:05:45,906 --> 01:05:46,949
What is it then?

866
01:05:47,116 --> 01:05:48,701
We don't have to move out, do we?

867
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:54,081
But no good can come
from arguing with the building owner.

868
01:05:54,999 --> 01:05:57,543
You better work things out well.

869
01:05:58,169 --> 01:06:01,755
But it bothers me that the new owner
wants to run his business here.

870
01:06:02,882 --> 01:06:04,175
That's what bothers me too.

871
01:06:04,258 --> 01:06:06,093
It happens a lot.

872
01:06:06,177 --> 01:06:08,721
Owners often kick out their tenants
to run their business.

873
01:06:09,096 --> 01:06:12,475
It means they want to take the premium.

874
01:06:12,558 --> 01:06:15,895
The premium of this pub
is more than 100 million. That's absurd.

875
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,771
There's nothing you can do

876
01:06:17,855 --> 01:06:19,982
if you can't find a new tenant
during the last 3 months.

877
01:06:20,524 --> 01:06:23,944
You can assert your legal rights
for the last three months,

878
01:06:24,028 --> 01:06:25,362
-but...
-It means,

879
01:06:25,446 --> 01:06:27,823
we have to move out.

880
01:06:30,868 --> 01:06:32,703
We've done the marketing work.

881
01:06:32,828 --> 01:06:34,413
Even if we get the premium,

882
01:06:34,497 --> 01:06:35,956
it's our loss once we move out.

883
01:06:36,499 --> 01:06:38,584
I have the number
of the new building owner.

884
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:40,044
I should convince him.

885
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:45,090
Damn it.

886
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,808
NEW BUILDING OWNER

887
01:06:59,688 --> 01:07:00,648
<i>Hello?</i>

888
01:07:01,232 --> 01:07:05,861
Hello. I'm the owner of DanBam in Itaewon,
Park Saeroyi.

889
01:07:05,945 --> 01:07:08,239
I heard you took over the building.

890
01:07:08,322 --> 01:07:10,115
So I'm calling you to say hello.

891
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:11,367
<i>Okay.</i>

892
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:13,369
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

893
01:07:13,744 --> 01:07:14,745
Pardon?

894
01:07:20,084 --> 01:07:21,085
It's me.

895
01:07:22,586 --> 01:07:23,879
Jang Dae-hee.

RELATIONSHIP: FRIEND

898
01:07:58,581 --> 01:08:01,333
Is it Jangga? They just want to get
rid of someone they don't like.

899
01:08:01,417 --> 01:08:02,960
He is a man of huge caliber.

900
01:08:03,043 --> 01:08:05,254
Yi-seo, another word
and you will get scolded.

901
01:08:05,337 --> 01:08:07,423
<i>You and the girl named Yi-seo.</i>

902
01:08:07,506 --> 01:08:09,049
<i>I didn't know you were so emotional.</i>

903
01:08:09,133 --> 01:08:10,968
Why don't you just shut down the business?

904
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:12,428
<i>There's one way.</i>

905
01:08:12,511 --> 01:08:13,512
<i>No way.</i>

906
01:08:14,597 --> 01:08:16,098
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

907
01:08:16,181 --> 01:08:19,351
-Get on your knees and apologize.
-Getting expelled? Getting kicked out?

908
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:22,521
You took absolutely nothing from me.

909
01:08:22,605 --> 01:08:26,317
I'm really sorry
for what my family has done to you.

910
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,778
Geun-soo says he will talk to his dad
on condition that he quits his job here.

911
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:31,113
What do you think?

912
01:08:31,196 --> 01:08:33,073
Of course I agree with it.

913
01:08:35,034 --> 01:08:36,035
You don't deserve

914
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:38,704
to be the manager here.
