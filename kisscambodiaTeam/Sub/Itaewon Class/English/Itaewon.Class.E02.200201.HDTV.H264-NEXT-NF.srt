GWANGJIN HOSPITAL

6
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,874
Where? Where are you?

7
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,169
Okay. I have to go.

8
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:54,964
He's at the hospital, Gwangjin Hospital.

9
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,882
-Let's go to Gwangjin Hospital.
-Okay.

10
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,096
Let's calm down
and call the police first...

11
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:10,855
Can we please go a little faster?

12
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:12,690
Okay.

13
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:32,877
What are you doing?

14
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:36,213
How did you...

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,593
Now that you seem startled,
it's just obvious.

16
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,180
Wait. Hang on a second.

17
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:49,894
It's you, right?

18
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,815
Wait.

19
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,903
Let's talk it out. Calm down.

20
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,198
Why did you not call the hospital?

21
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,449
No.

22
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:05,868
It's not like that. Let's talk it out.
Let this go!

23
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,625
Why is someone else being punished?

24
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,293
Help!

25
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,797
Help me!

26
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,679
Hang on. Wait and just listen to me.

27
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,058
You jerk.

28
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,478
Why did you kill my dad?

29
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:37,942
Why?

30
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:43,781
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:46,409
I'm really sorry.

32
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,463
Please stop. I'm so sorry.

33
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,719
It's too late.

34
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,892
The one who should receive the apology

35
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:14,645
is dead.

36
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:21,193
Wait. Please don't do this.

37
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:24,321
You killed him.

38
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:27,158
You have to

39
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,201
go apologize to him.

40
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:33,789
You have to die!

41
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,625
Die!

42
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,211
Go ahead and die!

43
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:43,215
Die! Die, you jerk!

44
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,759
Damn it.

45
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:48,929
You son of a bitch.

46
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:21,378
Die, you jerk!

47
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:24,715
Stop!

48
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:28,093
Put that down.

49
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:34,808
Park Sae-ro-yi!

50
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,399
Put it down at once!

51
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:45,778
This bastard killed my dad.

52
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,239
Okay.

53
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,866
I'll investigate the case,
so put that down first.

54
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,786
I said this son of a bitch killed my dad!

55
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:55,162
Put it down!

56
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,209
Sae-ro-yi, put that down first, okay?

57
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,095
-Stop here, okay?
-Enough. Please!

58
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,347
Will you become a murderer because of him?

59
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,433
Listen to your friend.
This won't change anything.

60
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:18,102
I understand how you feel.

61
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,813
-Calm down first.
-Give me a break.

62
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:24,191
-What do you understand?
-Please.

63
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:27,653
-Put it down when I'm talking nicely.
-If not, then what?

64
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:33,617
Put it down.

65
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:37,871
You can shoot.

66
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,291
You see,

67
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,127
I don't care about anything anymore.

68
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:47,464
God damn it.

69
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:51,260
Wait.

70
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:54,054
-Hold on.
-Move!

71
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:55,639
Don't shoot him.

72
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:58,392
Soo-ah, step aside.

73
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:02,730
You crazy asshole.

74
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,442
No one wants this.

75
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,283
What do you even know?

76
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:17,786
My dad is dead!

77
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,665
I may not understand how you feel,

78
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,836
but I know how your dad
will feel about this.

79
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,465
He will never want you to ruin your life

80
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:33,427
by getting back at a scumbag like him
to avenge his death.

81
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,681
He'll never want you to do that.

82
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:41,977
You know that I'm right.

83
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,482
You know that better
than anybody else does.

84
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:53,572
Right?

85
00:06:58,202 --> 00:07:00,037
<i>I wanted you to be proud and confident.</i>

86
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,789
<i>And today, I could see</i>

87
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,542
you were already living like that.

88
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:12,007
You have no idea how proud I was.

89
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:19,973
I want you to keep
living like that, my son.

90
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,464
Damn it.

91
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,900
Dad...

92
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,403
Dad!

93
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:17,489
Dad!

94
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,492
Dad...

95
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,430
Dad...

00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:30,414
<i>my dad's funeral</i>

99
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,836
<i>came to an end.</i>

100
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,767
GWANGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

101
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,520
Hey, I have big news.

102
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:55,772
You know that the new kid's dad
passed away, right?

103
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,025
Apparently, it was because
Geun-won hit him with his car.

104
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:00,485
Geun-won got hospitalized
because of a car accident.

105
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:02,988
I heard the new kid went to the hospital
and threw a huge fit.

106
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:04,156
How do you know that?

107
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,575
My mom works at that hospital.

108
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,911
Maybe he was just angry
that he got expelled.

109
00:11:08,994 --> 00:11:11,246
How could Geun-won get away with murder?

110
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:13,832
Maybe you're right.

111
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,793
But who knows? His dad can cover up
pretty much everything.

112
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,796
-Yes, that's true.
-But think about it.

113
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,759
He got expelled because of Geun-won.

114
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,138
The new kid only hit Geun-won
because he wouldn't stop.

115
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:35,604

GYEONGGI NORTHERN DETENTION CENTER

117
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:13,600
DO NOT FORGET THIS DAY
GYEONGGI NORTHERN DETENTION CENTER

118
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,192
I'm sorry about your father.

119
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:25,278
But

120
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:28,365
you can't just take out
your anger on my son.

121
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:30,033
Don't you agree?

122
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:36,081
Why are you here?

123
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,088
I've known your father for 20 years.

124
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:45,674
So it hurts me to see you

125
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:48,385
locked up like this.

126
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:54,766
But you see,

127
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:57,185
to see you misbehave at school

128
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:02,149
and not self-reflect about your actions

129
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,191
makes me

130
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:05,902
want to correct you for some reason.

131
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,320
I asked you why you're here.

132
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,075
Just like before, I'm here

133
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:14,703
to give you a second chance.

134
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:19,750
-A second chance?
-What do you say?

135
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:22,377
If you self-reflect

136
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,963
and apologize to my son on your knees...

137
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:40,520
Your son is the one

138
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,566
who should get on his knees.

139
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,789
How interesting.

140
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,335
Is this how your father taught you?

141
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,802
Let me give you a word of advice
out of affection.

142
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,096
Beliefs.

143
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:16,014
Ambition.

144
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:19,518
They’re just words used by those
who have nothing but their egos.

145
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:22,729
If you gain nothing,

146
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,483
that's just being stubborn and foolish.

147
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,619
I'll leave you to self-reflect in prison.

148
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,218
The superintendent
took care of the detective

149
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,178
who secured the CCTV footage.

150
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:59,099
The public defender in charge also thinks
the best option is to reduce his sentence.

151
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,148
He's fearless.

152
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,441
Pardon?

153
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,694
It's very strange.

154
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,780
He gets on my nerves for some reason.

155
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,741
Are you talking about Park Sae-ro-yi?

156
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:21,204
Who's the student you mentioned last time?
The girl who talked about Geun-won's car.

157
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:26,293
Her name is Oh Soo-ah.
She's your son's classmate.

158
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,213
She grew up at the orphanage
that was once sponsored by the company.

159
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:32,674
Is that so?

160
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:40,599
We already admitted
that the car belonged to your son, sir.

161
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:45,061
But we clarified on the report
that the gardener had borrowed his car.

162
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,565
Her testimony will be useless.
You don't need to be bothered by it.

163
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,067
Is she friends

164
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,403
with Sae-ro-yi?

165
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:55,280
From what I know, yes.

166
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,658
Then arrange a meeting with her.

167
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,368
Okay, sir.

168
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,053
You actually look familiar.

169
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:20,889
I think I saw you a couple of times
at the orphanage.

170
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:25,185
Yes.

171
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:27,729
Are you friends with Geun-won?

172
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:29,731
We're classmates.

173
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:31,024
And are you

174
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,235
also friends with Sae-ro-yi?

175
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,198
Yes.

176
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:45,080
Our company runs a foundation.

177
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:49,501
We'd like to pay for your admission fee
and living expenses.

178
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:51,920
What do you think?

179
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,256
I have

180
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:56,800
enough money for my tuition.

181
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,426
That won't be enough.

182
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:02,055
You need money for rent
and other living expenses.

183
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,519
And in return?

184
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:13,525
"In return"?

185
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,324
Do I need to testify against Sae-ro-yi?

186
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,425
How interesting.

187
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,305
Actually, no.

188
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:46,224
This is actually very sad.

189
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,269
You must've lived such a difficult life

190
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,646
to think that way.

191
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:58,987
I'm just trying to do a good deed.
Don't get the wrong idea.

192
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:02,866
You're free to testify what you saw.

193
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:07,537
Mr. Kim, I want you to enroll her
in our financial support program.

194
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:10,874
-Okay, sir.
-Dad, I...

195
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,129
You may go now.

196
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,132
-I'll be off.
-What's going on?

197
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,509
What are you doing here?

198
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,721
What are you doing here?
You should be at the hospital.

199
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:28,224
I came to tell you something.

200
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,394
Soo-ah.

201
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:33,897
If...

202
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,774
If by any chance...

203
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:41,237
Yes?

204
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,158
If I really did ask you
something in return,

205
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:48,745
what would you have done?

206
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:50,622
Dad.

207
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,548
I'm joking.

208
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:03,134
I'll see you again.

209
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,194
Why did you call Soo-ah here?

210
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:23,530
Go back to the hospital.

211
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:28,952
Please let him free.

212
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,580
-What?
-Please free Sae-ro-yi from jail.

213
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:35,667
This all happened because of me.

214
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:38,128
Because of you?

215
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,840
I hit his dad with my car...

216
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,388
Mr. Kim is already getting punished

217
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:53,268
on your behalf
for having murdered Mr. Park.

218
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:55,186
-Dad.
-Enough!

219
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:08,366
I selected you as my successor.

220
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:13,121
But I still have another son
even though he's a bastard.

221
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:14,914
That means

222
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,417
you can always be replaced.

223
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,814
<i>I can't have my successor get convicted.</i>

224
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:41,774
That's absurd. No.

225
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:44,903
It should never happen.

226
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,530
But if it does,
I'll have to turn to my alternative.

227
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,283
-Dad.
-In order to set him free,

228
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,286
you'll have to admit that it was you.

229
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,664
So tell me.

230
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,750
Do you still want a settlement?

231
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:05,882
I'm sorry.

232
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,427
Good choice.

233
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:14,516
You can't gain anything
with consciousness.

234
00:21:15,016 --> 00:21:16,226
Okay?

235
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,647
This will be a good opportunity.
Follow me.

236
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:29,989
<i>Do you know what's funny?</i>

237
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,076
Pigs are smarter than dogs.

238
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:36,996
But nine out of ten people
will still eat pork

239
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,041
even though they're aware of that.

240
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:43,753
That's because they're delicious.

241
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:47,882
I don't get the standard of their values.

242
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:49,509
People eat pork,

243
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:53,096
but they loathe those who eat dog meat.

244
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:55,723
But then again,

245
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,978
dogs are very loyal and can be cute.
It's just a matter of perspective.

246
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,146
The employees

247
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,941
and those below you who work for money...

248
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,152
Just think of them as dogs.

249
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,781
Dad.

250
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,624
Look at how big they've grown.

251
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,213
Let's see.

252
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:32,343
Which one should I cook?

253
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,436
-Let me see.
-Shit!

254
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:56,909
Dad.

255
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:00,622
What are you doing?

256
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,876
From killing a chicken
to business management,

257
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,795
you need to know and understand everything
to become a true owner.

258
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:10,089
Here.

259
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:13,468
Now, I'm going to cook this.

260
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:16,179
I'm going to twist its head and kill it.

261
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,682
Then I'll pluck its feathers,

262
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:22,060
take out its internal organs,

263
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,688
cut them into pieces,
and fry the pieces in oil.

264
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,777
Here. Go ahead and twist its head.

265
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,991
I can't.

266
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:41,954
-I can't do it!
-You can't do it?

267
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,291
Aren't you the company's successor?

268
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:50,546
Do it now!

269
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,866
Twist it properly.

270
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:22,078
If you don't,
it'll try to escape with a broken neck.

271
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:28,584
Park Sae-ro-yi.
I could tell just by looking at him.

272
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:32,338
I'm sorry to say this,
but you're half the man he is.

273
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:35,258
But he's just an animal
while you're a human being.

274
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,469
I can't stand the fact

275
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:42,682
that you feel sorry even though
he beat you up two times in a row.

276
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,855
Think of this chicken as Sae-ro-yi.

277
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,649
If you're my son

278
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:54,444
and the successor of Jangga Co.,

279
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:57,572
do not feel sorry

280
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:00,783
to eat pork or chicken.

281
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:16,466
Can't you do it?

282
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:28,978
I can.

283
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,274
I can do it.

284
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:36,819
That's right.

285
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:41,783
You're right, Dad.

286
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:46,454
Sae-ro-yi

287
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:49,332
is just livestock.

288
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:21,614
TODAY'S TRIAL

289
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,032
<i>Here's the ruling.</i>

290
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,869
The defendant seems to have aimed
to murder the victim

291
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,747
judging by the weapon he used
and the victim’s condition.

292
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:34,335
Also, he doesn’t admit to his faults
or regrets his actions

293
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:37,213
even though it was all based on
the defendant's misunderstanding.

294
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:40,550
The victim's estimated time of death
is 8:20 p.m.

295
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,636
This guy was at home sweeping the garden.
It doesn't make any sense.

296
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:45,721
Right.

297
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:47,473
It doesn't make sense.

298
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:51,435
You once killed someone through coercion

299
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:53,563
and even got demoted for that.

300
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,816
How are you on the promotion list?

301
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,986
-Pardon?
-How did you get this?

302
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:03,322
Did you go through a civilian CCTV footage

303
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:06,117
without even asking me or the house owner?

304
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:09,161
-Sir.
-Wake up, you punk.

305
00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:13,416
Get to your senses
if you want to keep your job.

306
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:19,922
Isn't your daughter
turning one next month?

307
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:23,509
Don't let that useless sense of justice
get the best of you.

308
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:25,970
You should think about your family.

309
00:27:26,637 --> 00:27:27,847
<i>Remember.</i>

310
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:29,557
<i>Your life</i>

311
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:31,934
<i>depends on the chairman's son.</i>

312
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:39,191
Therefore, according to Article 254
of the Criminal Law, the defendant will be

313
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,111
sentenced to three years in prison.

314
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:01,797
CHUNGCHEONG PRISON

315
00:28:19,315 --> 00:28:20,858
He will be staying here with you.

316
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:25,404
Don't even try to do a hazing ritual.

317
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:29,951
He's just a little kid.
Why would we mess with a kid?

318
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:32,161
Don't worry.

319
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:45,341
Hey, kid.

320
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:48,094
When you first greet adults,

321
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:51,138
you should get on your knees
and introduce yourself.

322
00:28:56,143 --> 00:28:59,480
I want you to kneel before my son
and apologize for what you did.

323
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:03,943
You little jerk. What are you looking at?

324
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,529
I should just take out your eyeballs.

325
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:22,712
What the heck?

326
00:29:23,212 --> 00:29:24,755
Is he a psycho?

327
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:29,051
<i>Will things become a bit easier</i>

328
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:31,887
<i>if I get on my knees?</i>

329
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:36,267
Why is everyone so obsessed
with making me get on my knees?

330
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:44,108
<i>But,</i>

331
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:46,360
<i>I'm your son.</i>

332
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,450
<i>Unlike myself,</i>

333
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:55,870
<i>I wanted you to be proud and confident.</i>

334
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,707
<i>I want you to keep living like that,</i>

335
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,001
<i>my son.</i>

336
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:41,248
What's wrong with your face?

337
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,092
Just because.

338
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:58,933
Thank you for coming all the way here
to see me.

339
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:06,482
Is there something wrong?

340
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:13,739
I got accepted to Gwangjin University.

341
00:31:13,823 --> 00:31:14,657
Really?

342
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:17,118
That's great.
You always wanted to go there.

343
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:26,919
But why the long face?

344
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:30,381
Jangga Co.

345
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,009
offered to support me

346
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,345
with a scholarship.

347
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,441
It's because I reported you that day
and stopped you.

348
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:54,864
That's why they offered me this.

349
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,495
I'm sorry.

350
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,003
I'm not strong like you. I'm a coward.

351
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:16,302
I'm sorry.

352
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:22,349
It's okay.

353
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:27,688
What?

354
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:33,152
It's true that I hit Geun-won.

355
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:37,364
And you did the right thing
by calling the cops.

356
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:41,327
I should actually thank you.

357
00:32:43,913 --> 00:32:45,122
If you didn't stop me,

358
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,460
I'd be in here

359
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:52,129
for murder.

360
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,218
Sae-ro-yi.

361
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,638
You made a choice.

362
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:03,682
So just stick to it.

363
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:08,229
You did nothing wrong.

364
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:25,537
What do you plan to do
once you get released?

365
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:31,752
Apparently, an ex-convict

366
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,046
can't be a police officer.

367
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:40,302
There's a library here,
and it has tons of books.

368
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:43,555
-Books?
-Yes.

369
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:48,727
I have a lot of time now,
so I thought I could use this chance

370
00:33:49,937 --> 00:33:51,021
to study and stuff.

371
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,609
Then I came across
Chairman Jang's autobiography.

372
00:33:58,028 --> 00:33:59,029
His autobiography?

373
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:00,823
I was amazed.

374
00:34:01,532 --> 00:34:03,867
He started out small
and built that into a huge corporation.

375
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:07,204
It made me want to try as well.

376
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:12,376
You want to start your own restaurant?

377
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:14,128
Yes.

378
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:16,964
I see.

379
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:19,925
Revenge.

380
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:28,434
No way.

381
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:31,895
I just wondered

382
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,232
what might be fun.

383
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:39,069
I've always dreamed
of running my own business.

384
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,697
My heart is pounding with anticipation.

385
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:45,868
Your cooking skills

386
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,537
are getting better by the day.

387
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,705
This is delicious.

388
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,669
I heard people tell me
that I'm a pretty good cook.

389
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,756
And I just...

390
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:00,716
I just thought it might be fun.

391
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:16,732
I should go now.

392
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:26,075
Sae-ro-yi.

393
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:29,995
Yes?

394
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,040
Why did you

395
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:35,918
try to

396
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:38,212
make a move on me?

397
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:41,924
What?

398
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:46,428
Why did you ask for my number?

399
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:49,556
Oh, that day?

400
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:55,646
I'm sorry.
I know you asked me not to like you.

401
00:36:01,652 --> 00:36:02,820
But I did because I like you.

402
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,368
Do you still

403
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:10,994
like me?

404
00:36:19,586 --> 00:36:21,630
I don't like guys who are poor.

405
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:29,012
Do you plan to make a lot of money?

406
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,478
From this moment on,

407
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,191
my dream is to become rich.

408
00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:03,464
<i>I had a huge hole in my heart.</i>

409
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:07,426
<i>I was lethargic.</i>

410
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:11,430
<i>But strangely enough,</i>

411
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:14,766
<i>I got so easily provoked by him.</i>

412
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:18,770
<i>It was useless to resent anyone.</i>

413
00:37:21,315 --> 00:37:22,774
<i>Because my dad was already gone.</i>

414
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:26,653
<i>So that was definitely</i>

415
00:37:27,237 --> 00:37:28,906
<i>the last thing on my mind.</i>

416
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:34,036
Revenge.

417
00:37:38,332 --> 00:37:39,416
<i>It feels like</i>

418
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,045
<i>the word fills up my empty heart.</i>

419
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:56,475
<i>I can't...</i>

420
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,020
<i>I can't wait to get out of here.</i>

421
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:10,405
2 YEARS LATER

422
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,366
There he comes.

423
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:14,284
-Welcome back, Boss.
-Welcome back, Boss.

424
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:15,494
All right.

425
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,711
-Here, Boss.
-It's okay. You eat it.

426
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,423
The weather is nice.

427
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:32,719
Sae-ro-yi, no one's coming?

428
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,722
-No.
-Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

429
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:38,016
It's okay. I want to take a walk.

430
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,061
Do you? Okay. Get some fresh air.

431
00:38:41,562 --> 00:38:43,522
If you need help, call me anytime.

432
00:38:44,106 --> 00:38:45,899
-I'll see you later.
-Take care.

433
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,665
He looks young.

434
00:39:02,249 --> 00:39:04,001
You seem to care about him.

435
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:05,877
What does he do?

436
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:08,755
He's no big deal.

437
00:39:09,756 --> 00:39:13,051
He's just a fearless and reckless guy.

438
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:16,013
<i>He's a man.</i>

439
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:25,522
Welcome.

440
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,155
Would you like to order?

441
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:36,283
I'll have soft tofu stew and soju, please.

442
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:37,743
Do you need one glass?

443
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:39,119
Well...

444
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:21,078
How does it taste?

445
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,135
It's bitter.

446
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:54,569
<i>Beliefs.</i>

447
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,613
<i>Ambition.</i>

448
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,075
They’re just words used by those
who have nothing but their egos.

449
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:03,245
If you gain nothing,

450
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,456
<i>that's just being stubborn and foolish.</i>

451
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,874
<i>DELICIOUS LIFE</i>

452
00:41:11,878 --> 00:41:13,088
Thank you.

453
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:18,301
Sir, you forgot your book.

454
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:24,891
Please throw it out. I memorized it all.

455
00:41:25,392 --> 00:41:26,393
Bye.

456
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:34,317
I CAN BEAT HIM

457
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:36,862
THE SUPERCILIOUS SON
OF JANG'S FAMILY, JANG GEUN-WON

458
00:41:36,945 --> 00:41:40,532
DIRECTOR KANG MIN-JUNG
SAVING FACE OF JANGGA CO.

459
00:41:47,664 --> 00:41:50,959
<i>On the 9th, at Jang's Family Pub,
Jang's Group's leading brand,</i>

460
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,669
<i>there was an assault case.</i>

461
00:41:52,753 --> 00:41:56,006
<i>The assailant assaulted an employee there
as he didn't recognize him.</i>

462
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:58,341
<i>Surprisingly, the assailant turned out</i>

463
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:00,469
<i>to be Chairman Jang Dae-hee's son
from Jang's Group,</i>

464
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,971
<i>Jang Geun-won who is 21 years old.</i>

465
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:06,433
<i>In a drunken stupor,
he refused to show his ID card</i>

466
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:08,059
<i>and lashed out at the employee</i>

467
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:11,563
<i>saying his domestic animal
failed to recognize its owner.</i>

468
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:14,608
<i>He also struck the employee in the face.</i>

469
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:16,276
<i>The video of him spread quickly,</i>

470
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:17,986
<i>and it led to a sharp fall
in Jang's stocks</i>

471
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,030
<i>and a nationwide consumer boycott</i>

472
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:22,991
<i>inflaming public anger.</i>

473
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:26,036
Seoul, please.

474
00:42:41,051 --> 00:42:42,511
<i>Hello, Sae-ro-yi.</i>

475
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,764
<i>It has taken so long to write to you.</i>

476
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:47,224
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

477
00:42:47,474 --> 00:42:50,101
<i>Thinking about how
you'd be feeling in there,</i>

478
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:52,938
<i>I was a little hesitant to write you</i>

479
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:54,773
<i>just to ask how you were doing.</i>

480
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:58,026
<i>I'm sure you'd tell me</i>

481
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,570
<i>not to worry about anything
with a silly smile.</i>

482
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:03,073
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

483
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:05,700
<i>I miss you.</i>

484
00:43:08,578 --> 00:43:10,997
<i>I live in a neighborhood called Itaewon.</i>

485
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,501
<i>I wasn't sure what to say,</i>

486
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:17,963
<i>so I decided to tell you
about this neighborhood.</i>

487
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:27,889
<i>Have you been to Itaewon before?</i>

488
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:47,659
<i>On October 31 every year,</i>

489
00:43:47,742 --> 00:43:49,744
<i>people enjoy this festival
from the States here.</i>

490
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:58,044
<i>Apparently they try to comfort
the spirits of the dead</i>

491
00:43:58,128 --> 00:44:00,088
<i>and ward off evil spirits.</i>

492
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:07,846
<i>People are dressed in strange costumes
and bizarre makeup</i>

493
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:10,932
<i>so evil spirits won't do them harm.</i>

494
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,102
<i>The day</i>

495
00:44:14,936 --> 00:44:16,313
<i>is Halloween Day.</i>

496
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:21,443
<i>A lot of people come to Itaewon
to celebrate Halloween Day.</i>

497
00:44:22,235 --> 00:44:25,864
<i>A lot of grownups enjoy this festival
in funny costumes.</i>

498
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:31,661
<i>Besides this festival,
Itaewon is still an attractive place.</i>

499
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:37,250
<i>There are pretty buildings and a variety
of people from across the world,</i>

500
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:39,336
<i>which makes you feel like
you're on an overseas trip.</i>

501
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,129
<i>And everyone there</i>

502
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:43,548
<i>looks so free.</i>

503
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,969
<i>It's a place where you can enjoy a walk.</i>

504
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:52,766
<i>It feels like the whole world
is condensed into this street.</i>

505
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:56,019
<i>And I fell in love with this place.</i>

506
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:04,945
<i>When I walk on this street,</i>

507
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,238
<i>I miss you a lot.</i>

508
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,160
<i>The hill we ran down together
on the day of the exam.</i>

509
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:16,331
<i>The lake where you asked me
about my number.</i>

510
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:19,960
<i>And</i>

511
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:22,754
<i>your shy smile.</i>

512
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:25,382
<i>I want to see it again.</i>

513
00:45:26,716 --> 00:45:28,176
<i>I'll look forward to it then.</i>

514
00:45:28,635 --> 00:45:30,929
<i>I wish you happiness for now and always.</i>

515
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:33,181
<i>From Oh Soo-ah.</i>

516
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:42,482
This is so nice.

517
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,975
What? What's that?

518
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,728
My gosh.

519
00:46:21,688 --> 00:46:23,440
Who are you? Who is this?

520
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:34,200
When were you released?

521
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:35,994
Oh Soo-ah?

522
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:39,581
What...

523
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:43,877
-How did we...
-It's so good to see you.

524
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:46,337
Okay.

525
00:46:47,088 --> 00:46:48,631
What a nice surprise to see you here.

526
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:50,216
I know.

527
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:52,761
When did you come out?

528
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,512
Well, it's...

529
00:46:54,596 --> 00:46:57,557
-Lose a little weight, you'll be a model.
-Seok-cheon.

530
00:46:57,766 --> 00:47:00,810
Hey, Soo-ah. Happy Halloween!

531
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:03,063
Come over here and sit.

532
00:47:04,397 --> 00:47:06,608
Who's this handsome guy?
Is he your boyfriend?

533
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,234
No, he's not.

534
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:09,277
Really?

535
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:11,946
Then what about you?
Do you have a girlfriend?

536
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,366
-Gosh, no.
-Don't flirt with him.

537
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,743
I'll tell Philip about it.

538
00:47:16,826 --> 00:47:19,746
Gosh, don't be ridiculous.
I was just asking.

539
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,582
And he's not handsome at all.

540
00:47:22,957 --> 00:47:24,000
He looks like a chestnut.

541
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:26,669
A chestnut? Chestnuts can be sexy.

542
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:30,215
It pokes you a lot. Gosh, he's so cute.

543
00:47:30,298 --> 00:47:31,716
You never make concessions.

544
00:47:32,342 --> 00:47:33,885
Right. I don't.

545
00:47:35,512 --> 00:47:36,805
You know Seok-cheon.

546
00:47:37,514 --> 00:47:39,516
Yes. I've seen him on TV.

547
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,267
It's amazing to see him in person.

548
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:43,770
He's a big player in Itaewon.

549
00:47:44,104 --> 00:47:45,605
I learn a lot from him.

550
00:47:45,814 --> 00:47:47,065
That's great.

551
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,741
What did you do after you came out?

552
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,495
I've prepared a lot of things.

553
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:01,830
Prepare?

554
00:48:02,622 --> 00:48:04,374
What about you? Do you go to college?

555
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,626
Yes.

556
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:09,254
I'll start working next year.

557
00:48:09,337 --> 00:48:10,839
Oh, already?

558
00:48:12,507 --> 00:48:15,260
I'll be working at Jangga Co.

559
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:20,223
I see.

560
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:23,518
You said you'd open your own business.

561
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:24,686
Have you been working on it?

562
00:48:25,895 --> 00:48:27,730
Well, kind of.

563
00:48:27,814 --> 00:48:29,983
I see. Where would it be?

564
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:33,903
I was going to go around

565
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:35,822
and think about it.

566
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:38,741
But I like this place.

567
00:48:39,325 --> 00:48:40,285
What?

568
00:48:40,827 --> 00:48:41,703
Itaewon?

569
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,037
Yes.

570
00:48:43,746 --> 00:48:46,124
Itaewon? Well...

571
00:48:46,249 --> 00:48:48,793
It wouldn't be a good place
for you to start a business.

572
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:51,796
There's a big difference
between weekdays and weekends.

573
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,965
Compared to the downtown areas
like Hongdae or Kondae,

574
00:48:54,048 --> 00:48:55,800
people leave the place early.

575
00:48:56,092 --> 00:48:57,802
Stores in good locations
have a high premium.

576
00:48:57,886 --> 00:49:00,513
Of course the rent and deposit
are very expensive.

577
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:03,975
I like this place.

578
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,268
I love it.

579
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,523
When will you start?

580
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:11,858
In seven years.

581
00:49:14,027 --> 00:49:15,111
Are you all right?

582
00:49:16,029 --> 00:49:17,030
Sorry.

583
00:49:17,238 --> 00:49:18,948
That was cool. It's okay.

584
00:49:20,366 --> 00:49:23,328
So seven years? It's a long time.

585
00:49:24,078 --> 00:49:25,496
What are you going to do until then?

586
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,664
Deep-sea fishing.

587
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,254
Are you doing this on purpose?

588
00:49:33,963 --> 00:49:35,506
I'm really sorry.

589
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,219
It's really hard for an ex-convict
to become a seaman.

590
00:49:39,302 --> 00:49:40,553
I barely got the certificate.

591
00:49:45,391 --> 00:49:47,101
Why do you want to go deep-sea fishing?

592
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:48,937
I'm a middle school graduate ex-convict.

593
00:49:49,229 --> 00:49:50,855
I don't have many career options.

594
00:49:54,776 --> 00:49:55,944
Well...

595
00:49:57,862 --> 00:49:59,864
When you were put in jail,

596
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:04,619
I helped you liquidate your dad's store
and claim for the insurance money.

597
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,206
It was a significant amount.

598
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:12,085
Besides the money,

599
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:15,755
he also saved some money
for my college fund.

600
00:50:17,131 --> 00:50:19,259
Then why would you go deep-sea fishing?

601
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:28,351
It's the price of my dad's life.

602
00:50:32,313 --> 00:50:33,982
It should be more meaningful.

603
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,116
When are you leaving?

604
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,868
-Next week.
-Next week?

605
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:47,954
How long will you stay in Itaewon?

606
00:50:48,037 --> 00:50:49,622
I'll leave on the first bus.

607
00:50:50,832 --> 00:50:51,833
Really?

608
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:58,172
All right then.
Let's have fun all night long.

609
00:50:59,173 --> 00:51:00,174
Okay.

610
00:51:14,063 --> 00:51:16,899
<i>For the first time after that night,</i>

611
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:20,987
<i>I could be free</i>

612
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:23,573
<i>from a whirlpool of emotion</i>

613
00:51:26,576 --> 00:51:28,661
<i>like tormenting yearnings</i>

614
00:51:31,331 --> 00:51:32,790
<i>and revengeful thoughts.</i>

615
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:36,794
In one, two, and three.

616
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:52,185
<i>My first time in Itaewon.</i>

617
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:57,940
<i>My first Halloween Day.</i>

618
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:01,152
<i>With my first love.</i>

619
00:52:11,037 --> 00:52:13,039
<i>It was a perfect day</i>

620
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:16,459
<i>for me</i>

621
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:21,130
<i>who was about to go on a long journey.</i>

622
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:32,600
Shall we keep going straight ahead?

623
00:52:33,601 --> 00:52:34,560
Yes.

624
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,229
Keep going straight.

625
00:52:37,397 --> 00:52:38,606
All right.

626
00:52:39,565 --> 00:52:40,650
I'm heavy, aren't I?

627
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,904
No, you're not.
You should gain some weight.

628
00:52:48,157 --> 00:52:49,158
I'm sorry.

629
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:52,745
Seriously, you're not heavy.

630
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:56,791
I'm sorry.

631
00:52:58,251 --> 00:52:59,836
What are you sorry for?

632
00:53:02,088 --> 00:53:03,423
I know

633
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:07,385
what Jangga Co. means to you.

634
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,888
You can resent me.

635
00:53:15,685 --> 00:53:17,395
Don't be silly.

636
00:53:19,647 --> 00:53:23,526
You said you wish me happiness
for now and always.

637
00:53:25,653 --> 00:53:26,654
What?

638
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,782
After I lost my dad,

639
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:33,327
I felt like I was left alone in prison.

640
00:53:34,495 --> 00:53:36,956
But this very sentence in your letter

641
00:53:37,457 --> 00:53:39,333
meant a lot to me.

642
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:43,463
There's no way I can resent you.

643
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:47,633
You're just living your life.

644
00:53:48,634 --> 00:53:50,470
And I'm always grateful.

645
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:08,154
All right.

646
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,865
Is this it?

647
00:54:12,325 --> 00:54:13,326
Yes.

648
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:29,467
Are you leaving now?

649
00:54:30,843 --> 00:54:31,844
Yes.

650
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:39,894
I had

651
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:42,897
a lot of fun today.

652
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:50,571
When are you coming back?

653
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:55,034
I don't know.

654
00:54:56,244 --> 00:54:57,578
I'm not sure yet.

655
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:10,216
This is an old building, so it's not warm.

656
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:12,426
It's a tiny room.

657
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:14,595
And I have only one blanket.

658
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:19,183
What?

659
00:55:22,103 --> 00:55:23,271
Do you want to stay tonight?

660
00:55:28,276 --> 00:55:29,110
Oh...

661
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:36,242
You don't want to?

662
00:55:46,127 --> 00:55:48,087
I'm not rich yet.

663
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:02,852
Forget it.

664
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:26,751
Sae-ro-yi.

665
00:56:32,173 --> 00:56:33,424
Take care.

666
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:35,968
Stay healthy.

667
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:41,098
Okay.

668
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:43,351
You too.

669
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:56,197
Go on in.

670
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:23,808
-Lee Jun-dong.
-Yes.

671
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:27,812
Park Hui-jun.

672
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:37,571
Park... It's a unique name.

673
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:39,198
-Park Sae-ro-yi.
-Yes.

674
00:57:43,953 --> 00:57:45,496
-Yu Tae-hyeon.
-Yes.

675
00:58:08,602 --> 00:58:11,981
7 YEARS LATER

676
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:17,945
JANGGA CO.

677
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,280
<i>I want that jerk</i>

678
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,491
to get screwed up.

679
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:30,666
What he's eating
looks even more delicious.

680
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:34,503
I'm sick of this guy.
I want to take her from him.

681
00:58:35,421 --> 00:58:37,715
I don't care even if others get doomed.

682
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:40,968
I want to be the most successful one.

683
00:58:42,261 --> 00:58:43,345
But

684
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:46,223
am I the only one who feels this way?

685
00:58:46,307 --> 00:58:47,892
Am I the one who's bad?

686
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,980
The world is unfair.
Don't force me to be nice.

687
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:54,774
I can be

688
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:57,026
a bad person today.

689
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:01,113
Come on into Vicious Bar.

690
00:59:02,615 --> 00:59:03,699
This is the concept.

691
00:59:03,783 --> 00:59:04,909
Hang on.

692
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:10,539
Why would people want to go
to an unpleasant place like that?

693
00:59:17,463 --> 00:59:18,589
Because

694
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:23,928
everyone is just

695
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:26,388
born evil.

696
00:59:27,515 --> 00:59:28,682
What?

697
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:32,978
You know the Evil Nature Principle.

698
00:59:33,687 --> 00:59:36,273
The theory that human nature
is fundamentally evil.

699
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:38,442
But if people stick to their instincts,

700
00:59:38,526 --> 00:59:40,277
society will collapse.

701
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:42,863
That's why people repress themselves

702
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:46,158
with manners, consideration,
morals, and the law.

703
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:48,536
Repression?

704
00:59:50,162 --> 00:59:51,413
It's stress.

705
00:59:53,082 --> 00:59:56,335
What if Vicious Bar can
relieve your stress?

706
00:59:56,418 --> 00:59:57,962
If that's possible,

707
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:00,506
it will be interesting.

708
01:00:02,216 --> 01:00:03,759
This is just a draft.

709
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:06,512
Please just consider the basic theme.

710
01:00:07,388 --> 01:00:08,347
Interesting.

711
01:00:09,098 --> 01:00:11,183
Sure. It's interesting.

712
01:00:11,725 --> 01:00:12,893
It's new.

713
01:00:13,185 --> 01:00:14,061
Thank you.

714
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:15,688
Proceed with it.

715
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:18,023
Get back to me with the updated report.

716
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:22,236
Hey, Soo-ah.

717
01:00:27,783 --> 01:00:29,410
Do you have a thing about me?

718
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:31,370
-What do you mean?
-You seem somewhat

719
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,539
cold to me.

720
01:00:34,874 --> 01:00:36,208
Am I supposed to be warm?

721
01:00:39,086 --> 01:00:41,505
Okay. What are you up to today?

722
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:42,548
I'm going to Itaewon.

723
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:44,341
For a meeting with the store manager.

724
01:00:44,425 --> 01:00:46,510
That's good. You're going my way.

725
01:00:47,094 --> 01:00:48,429
Can I give you a ride?

726
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:51,056
Hey. I need Soo-ah today.

727
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,725
Gosh, Min-jung.

728
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:54,852
Call me Ms. Kang at work.

729
01:00:55,728 --> 01:00:58,731
Do you guys have a plan?
Am I interrupting you?

730
01:00:58,814 --> 01:01:02,151
No way. Shall we go then?

731
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:05,446
Sorry.

732
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:12,661
You're in charge

733
01:01:12,745 --> 01:01:14,872
of brand planning as the director
at your age.

734
01:01:14,955 --> 01:01:16,498
It's reassuring to have you.

735
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:20,836
It's all thanks to your teaching.

736
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,714
I know. You have a good teacher, right?

737
01:01:23,797 --> 01:01:25,132
Sure.

738
01:01:26,842 --> 01:01:29,386
You're pretty and competent.

739
01:01:29,595 --> 01:01:31,597
I liked you from the beginning.

740
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:34,934
What do you think?

741
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:37,895
Isn't it about time
to choose your connection?

742
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:43,025
I've still got a lot to learn here.

743
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:44,443
That's too much for me.

744
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:46,737
Gosh, did I just get dumped?

745
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:50,866
No. I just want to learn more
to help you better.

746
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,661
You sneaky vixen.

747
01:01:55,371 --> 01:01:58,290
I just called you to ask
if you're interested in a blind date.

748
01:02:00,626 --> 01:02:01,627
A blind date?

749
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,672
I don't think you've dated a guy
since you joined our company.

750
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,927
I'm flattered, but maybe next time.

751
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:13,639
I think I will be busy
with the upcoming project.

752
01:02:14,515 --> 01:02:16,350
You live such an unexciting life.

753
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:17,810
Do you like your work that much?

754
01:02:17,893 --> 01:02:19,687
That's what I learned from you.

755
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,355
That's not what you're supposed to learn.

756
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:23,941
You'll be lonely in your later years.

757
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,247
<i>I'm 29.</i>

758
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:49,717
<i>I haven't seen Sae-ro-yi since that day.</i>

759
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:54,138
<i>Seven years was a long time.</i>

760
01:02:56,223 --> 01:02:59,143
<i>And about when my memories
about Sae-ro-yi started to fade...</i>

761
01:03:09,903 --> 01:03:12,489
I guess this store is sold.

762
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:20,622
Soo-ah.

763
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,496
You haven't changed.

764
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,209
Sae-ro-yi?

765
01:04:13,425 --> 01:04:14,635
<i>When will you start?</i>

766
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:15,969
In seven years.

767
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,352
<i>It's been exactly seven years.</i>

768
01:04:25,479 --> 01:04:28,982
<i>A store in Itaewon with the average
premium of over 200 million won.</i>

769
01:04:29,316 --> 01:04:30,400
DANBAM

770
01:04:30,484 --> 01:04:34,279
<i>The 22-year-old guy's plan
that sounded rather absurd.</i>

771
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:39,368
<i>But Sae-ro-yi</i>

772
01:04:42,788 --> 01:04:43,914
<i>made it happen.</i>

773
01:04:53,674 --> 01:04:54,800
Have you been doing well?

774
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,054
<i>To him,</i>

775
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:05,144
<i>it is</i>

776
01:05:05,978 --> 01:05:07,688
<i>only natural.</i>

777

778
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:29,209
I CAN BEAT HIM

779
01:05:35,716 --> 01:05:37,176
<i>Who is Cho Yi-seo?</i>

780
01:05:37,259 --> 01:05:39,011
You crazy bitch.

781
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:43,891
-Counter.
-<i>Cho Yi-seo.</i>

782
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:45,976
<i>A genius girl with an IQ of 162.</i>

783
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:48,812
<i>And Yi-seo is a sociopath.</i>

784
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:50,522
That's crazy.

785
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:54,526
<i>How nosy.</i>

786
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,819
We have customers.

787
01:05:56,904 --> 01:05:59,907
<i>Apparently Park Sae-ro-yi
opened a store in Itaewon.</i>

788
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,201
Whom would you choose?

789
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,828
Poor Sae-ro-yi who ruined his life
because of me.

790
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:07,581
I have a plan for 15 years.

791
01:06:08,749 --> 01:06:09,750
<i>Wait for me.</i>
