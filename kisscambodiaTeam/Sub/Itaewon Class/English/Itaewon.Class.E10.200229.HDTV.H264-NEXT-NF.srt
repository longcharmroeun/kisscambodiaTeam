EPISODE 10

5
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:19,850
Enough.

6
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:22,227
What?

7
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:26,273
I want you to stop now.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,860
Stop what?

9
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:35,407
RECORDING

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,783
Let me see.

11
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,537
Was it around here?

12
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:48,003
<i>The law is
all about disciplining the poor.</i>

13
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:51,131
<i>The law doesn't apply to those who rule.</i>

14
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:54,843
<i>So? Would you please
tell me about it in detail?</i>

15
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:57,262
<i>It's nothing.</i>

16
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:58,722
<i>It was an accident.</i>

17
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:02,017
<i>I hit his dad with a car,</i>

18
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:04,519
<i>and he died instantly.</i>

19
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:08,148
<i>But someone else ended up in jail.
End of the story.</i>

20
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:12,361
What are you doing?

21
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:16,949
I've never seen

22
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:20,160
a dumbhead like you my whole life.

23
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:21,662
Damn it.

24
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,380
You see,

25
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:35,342
I love my boss like crazy.

26
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:39,930
But the problem is

27
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:46,979
that his head is full of the bastards
from that damn Jangga Co.

28
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,818
I'm so jealous.

29
00:01:57,572 --> 00:02:00,242
You damn sons of bitches.

30
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:14,756
So

31
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:18,969
I'm going to crush you all.

32
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:29,604
Yi-seo.

33
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,273
Jo Yi-seo!

34
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:39,823
Hey, stop right there!

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,207
I...

36
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,084
clearly told you to stop.

37
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,881
You're guilty of covering up a murder
and now even assault.

38
00:02:58,175 --> 00:02:59,509
Give me your phone.

39
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:01,887
You'd better before I kill you.

40
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,015
I said, give me your phone!

41
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:08,769
You know what? We're in Itaewon now.

42
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:12,205
Help!

43
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:15,250
Help me! Somebody, help me!

44
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:20,881
Hey. What's going on, man?

45
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:28,789
This area is filled with gentlemen
from all over the world.

46
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,127
You're enjoying this.

47
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:39,591
You see, people aren't fans
of uncertain situations.

48
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,969
And if there's one thing
that always works...

49
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:45,222
Watch, okay?

50
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:56,483
You son of a bitch.

51
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:00,862
Get it?

52
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:04,199
In Itaewon,
or anywhere else for that matter,

53
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:06,159
money solves all problems--

54
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:13,041
Boss?

55
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,545
What's going on?

56
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:19,297
Why are you on the ground? Get up.

57
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:24,386
Boss, I recorded everything.

58
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:28,223
I recorded that bastard confessing
the murder of your father.

59
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:31,977
If we use this and involve the media,
the police may reinvestigate the case.

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,191
What happened to your face?

61
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:50,745
Was it you? Did you do that to her face?

62
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:52,998
Yes.

63
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,374
What about it?

64
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:57,460
You want to punch me? Go ahead.

65
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,337
Punch me all you want.

66
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:01,715
And get locked up again
for attempted murder.

67
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,008
-You crazy--
-Boss.

68
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:09,347
Don't be such a bluffer.
Go ahead and punch me.

69
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:11,308
Boss.

70
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:13,393
Don't.

71
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:31,828
Shit.

72
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,168
-Where are you going?
-Fuck, step aside.

73
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:41,046
-Move. I said, step aside.
-Jeez!

74
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:50,805
Damn it.

75
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,161
Just let it go.

76
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,247
It's all over now...

77
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:21,795
It's over.

78
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:28,885
Are you okay?

79
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:33,014
Yes, I'm fine.
These things don't hurt at all.

80
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,851
I saw you worrying about me
and getting angry for me. That's enough.

81
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,405
Sorry.

82
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:52,659
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,895
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOSS TEN YEARS AGO

84
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:24,274
<i>Last night,
an assault was reported in Itaewon.</i>

85
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,818
<i>It has been confirmed that the assailant
was Mr. Jang Geun-won,</i>

86
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:28,695
<i>the son of Jangga's chairman,
Mr. Jang Dae-hee,</i>

87
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,530
<i>who's been accused
of power abuse in the past.</i>

88
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:32,282
<i>This assault case</i>

89
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,659
<i>is taking a toll on public sentiment
toward the company.</i>

90
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:37,746
<i>According to the assault victim, Ms. Jo,</i>

91
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,706
<i>Mr. Jang lost his temper
because she recorded</i>

92
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,334
<i>his confession about a hit-and-run
which he caused in the past.</i>

93
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,794
<i>He couldn't control his anger
during their argument</i>

94
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:47,339
<i>and brutally assaulted the victim.</i>

95
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,093
You idiot!

96
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:55,930
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,561
I told you to bring her on board.

98
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:03,855
Why hit her?

99
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:09,819
I'm really sorry.

100
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:12,864
You moron.

101
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,368
And what?

102
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:18,745
You confessed to the hit-and-run?

103
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:29,506
Get out.

104
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:32,801
You don't even deserve a beating.

105
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,083
God damn it!

106
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:17,762
What are you doing here alone?

107
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:22,809
Min-jung.

108
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,897
I can't believe your father hit you.

109
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:29,232
Let me take a look.

110
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:31,609
Are you okay?

111
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:34,737
I deserved it.

112
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:36,990
Min-jung, I'm sorry for...

113
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:38,825
I mean...

114
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:43,037
Ms. Kang, I'm sorry for causing a mess.

115
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:45,331
What you did was wrong,

116
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:47,041
but what's done is done.

117
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:50,587
You shouldn't look so dejected
as the future head of the company.

118
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:52,922
Keep your chin up.

119
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:56,134
The company will do everything

120
00:09:57,177 --> 00:09:58,219
to take care of it.

121
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,566
Thank you.

122
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:16,779
<i>You must</i>

123
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,199
dismiss Geun-won.

124
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:23,495
The accident that killed Mr. Park
ten years ago

125
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,164
and the stuff you did to cover that up.

126
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:30,084
If people find out what happened,
you'll get involved in that mess.

127
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:33,546
And if that happens,

128
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,257
it'll no longer be a family issue.

129
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:43,973
How do you know

130
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:47,060
about what happened back then?

131
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,861
That kid, Yi-seo,
uploaded what she recorded.

132
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:00,323
Geun-won had just graduated high school.

133
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:03,451
He couldn't have dealt with it alone.

134
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:09,999
Is it the company or your son?

135
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:13,878
You need to choose.

136
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:42,031
Seung-kwon, I'll clean the bathroom.

137
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,367
Here. Gosh, what's this?

138
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:45,910
Go ahead.

139
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:55,920
Boss.

140
00:11:58,006 --> 00:12:00,550
I knew something happened
between you and Geun-soo's family.

141
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,011
But this is a lot more serious
that what I had imagined.

142
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:05,763
It would've been nice if you told us.

143
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:07,557
We don't know how to react to this.

144
00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:10,143
-What should we do?
-What's there to ask?

145
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,813
Hyun-yi, you keep making good food
while Seung-kwon serves the tables.

146
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:17,650
Yi-seo is right.

147
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,694
None of that matters. Just focus on work.

148
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:22,113
-Okay.
-Okay.

149
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:30,747
LEE HO-JIN

150
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,251
Hey. Right now?

151
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,462
I have time. Why?

152
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:44,218
Okay, ma'am.

153
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:45,803
I think it'll be fine.

154
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:50,224
Hello.

155
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,730
This is important.

156
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:58,650
Yes, I thought she should also hear it.

157
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:00,693
Let's sit down.

158
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:10,411
I wanted to introduce her to you one day.

159
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,623
I'm Jo Yi-seo, the manager of DanBam.

160
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:15,958
I saw you at Chairman Jang's seminar.

161
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:18,670
You're the one

162
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:21,923
who uploaded
Geun-won's confession on the web.

163
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,591
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:27,053
I know I'm working with Saeroyi right now.

165
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:29,597
But I'm a director at Jangga Co.

166
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:31,891
Do you know how much our stock price

167
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:33,976
has plummeted because of you?

168
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:36,646
But that was

169
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:38,981
bound to happen one day.

170
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:43,319
-What?
-She's right.

171
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:46,572
Yi-seo and I already talked about that.

172
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:48,825
What do you mean?

173
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:51,828
Chairman Jang represents Jangga Co.

174
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,372
What do you think will happen
to the stock price

175
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:56,624
once you replace Chairman Jang

176
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,501
and become the chairwoman?

177
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:02,922
You're very straightforward for a kid.
What's your point?

178
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:06,259
I think now is your chance.

179
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:12,932
The stock price plummeted
because of Chairman Jang's family issues.

180
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:15,893
This already happened in the past,
and it's happening again.

181
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,856
What do you think the stockholders
are thinking right now?

182
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:23,735
This is probably what's going on
in their minds.

183
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:28,364
"This family doesn't deserve
to lead Jangga Co."

184
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:37,290
-Are you saying--
-Yes.

185
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:40,960
Now is the right time

186
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,087
to dismiss the chairman.

187
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,476
What do you think?

188
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,231
I think it's more than possible.

189
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,738
Keep going.

190
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,699
But like I said earlier,

191
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:13,659
Chairman Jang represents Jangga Co.

192
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,996
There's too much at risk
to recklessly start a fight.

193
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,665
If things go haywire,
it'll end up destroying you instead.

194
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,377
So first of all,
we need to satisfy two conditions.

195
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:24,962
"Two conditions"?

196
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,924
The recording went public,

197
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,884
but it still doesn't have
much legal force.

198
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,386
He didn't even get charged
for what he did.

199
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:34,555
Here's the first condition.

200
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,659
Dad, why aren't you eating?

201
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:00,706
Hye-won.

202
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:06,087
I need to tell you something.

203
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:10,174
A long time ago,

204
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:13,636
I did something really bad

205
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:16,347
to Saeroyi.

206
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:25,982
You didn't have to come with me.

207
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:29,485
My life depends on this.
It's right that I come with you.

208
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,283
Isn't he...

209
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:44,834
Detective.

210
00:16:46,502 --> 00:16:47,920
Hey, Saeroyi.

211
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:50,339
What's the matter?

212
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:54,218
The thing is, Hye-won...

213
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,013
What?

214
00:16:58,514 --> 00:16:59,557
Hye-won!

215
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,561
Hye-won!

216
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:09,984
Hye-won!

217
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,403
My gosh.

218
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,615
Why does she disappear all the time?

219
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,491
Hye-won!

220
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:19,577
Hye-won!

221
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:25,666
My gosh...

222
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,919
I think she was too startled.

223
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:34,342
I made up my mind

224
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,093
to turn myself in.

225
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:39,931
And I bet she was really disappointed.

226
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,766
Gosh.

227
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:43,893
She ran out while I was talking.

228
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,438
Hye-won!

229
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:49,732
Hye-won!

230
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:57,239
Hye-won!

231
00:17:58,866 --> 00:17:59,867
My goodness.

232
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:06,165
Hey! Kid!

233
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:11,671
Hye-won.

234
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,761
Hello...

235
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:22,223
My gosh, you practically made me exercise.

236
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:26,143
Why would you run away from home?
You're just an elementary school kid.

237
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:33,818
Hye-won!

238
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:38,155
Hye-won.

239
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,002
What my dad did

240
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:54,255
to Saeroyi's dad...

241
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:58,467
He shouldn't have done that as a cop.

242
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:02,346
I feel really sorry about what happened.

243
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:07,893
Are you disappointed in your dad?

244
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,312
Yes. But...

245
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,400
Saeroyi, I'm sorry for saying this.

246
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,862
But I don't want my dad
to get punished either.

247
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,156
I don't want him to leave me.

248
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:28,164
I bet your dad's been
having a hard time as well.

249
00:19:29,498 --> 00:19:30,499
Just like you,

250
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,752
he didn't want to be apart from you.

251
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:35,171
Everyone

252
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,423
makes mistakes.

253
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:40,134
But not everyone takes responsibility.

254
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:41,802
Only the brave can do that.

255
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,892
You told me that you're proud
of your dad, right?

256
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:50,895
Yes.

257
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:56,108
Your dad mustered up his courage
and decided to take responsibility

258
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:59,987
so he could be the proud dad
that you think he is.

259
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,282
So why don't you try and understand him?

260
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:13,709
Dad.

261
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:21,926
Hye-won.

262
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:29,767
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,103
I'm sorry.

264
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,067
From now on,

265
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,653
I'll be an honorable person.

266
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:42,530
So please don't cry.

267
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:44,824
<i>Here's the first condition.</i>

268
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,201
Jang Geun-won needs to get charged.

269
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:51,664
And in order for that to happen,
Detective Oh needs to turn himself in.

270
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:59,255
Don't cry.

271
00:21:01,382 --> 00:21:02,508
He's here!

272
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,851
Mr. Jang, did you really cover up
a hit-and-run accident?

273
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,227
How do you feel?

274
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:15,563
How is the case going? Please tell us.

275
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:17,773
Didn't your father cover up the accident?

276
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:20,025
Mr. Jang, how do you feel right now?

277
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,697
I'll do my best to cooperate
with the investigation.

278
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:28,325
Does that mean you plead guilty?

279
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:30,619
-Did you really commit a hit-and-run?
-Mr. Jang.

280
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:33,247
Jang Geun-won got booked
without physical detention.

281
00:21:33,747 --> 00:21:35,708
That satisfied the first condition.

282
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,293
It's time for the second one.

283
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:39,795
Ms. Kang, you need to find out
what Chairman Jang wants.

284
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:41,755
What he wants?

285
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:45,968
You need to know
if he will protect his son, do nothing,

286
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,554
or even worse, abandon him.

287
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:52,016
This is very important.

288
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,562
What if he abandons him?

289
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,939
I'm afraid

290
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:00,524
we should give up.

291
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:06,238
That's ridiculous.

292
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:09,825
If we gather the stocks of Ms. Kang,
the executives who support her,

293
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:11,660
and those who are now
against the chairman,

294
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,913
this fight will be ours to win.
So why would we give up?

295
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:15,581
We'll have the upper hand

296
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:18,709
if he tries to protect his son
or just decides to remain silent.

297
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:22,630
But if he chooses the company
over his own son,

298
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:27,593
it'll be more than enough
to calm the restless stockholders.

299
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:30,012
Chairman Jang has
a lot of love for his family.

300
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:32,223
But will he choose the company

301
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:34,558
or his son?

302
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:38,604
He'll abandon his son.

303
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:42,274
Why do you think so?

304
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,026
That just feels like

305
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:47,446
what Chairman Jang would do.

306
00:22:48,197 --> 00:22:51,075
That means we've been
doing all this for nothing.

307
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:52,868
Are you aware of that?

308
00:22:53,744 --> 00:22:56,372
I think it's best
that we also think of a second plan.

309
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:59,333
Instead of dismissing the chairman,
how about we gather more evidence

310
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,377
-and have him get investigated--
-And do what?

311
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,214
Reveal the truth
regarding your father's death?

312
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:07,299
Saeroyi, you need to be realistic.

313
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:09,802
-Hey--
-Do you think Chairman Jang

314
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:12,638
would've made any mistakes
regarding that case?

315
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:15,641
Even the prosecution couldn't prove
that he was involved.

316
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:18,143
Everything was prepared meticulously
before he covered it up.

317
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:20,437
You know what I mean, Ms. Kang.

318
00:23:21,063 --> 00:23:23,524
Look how he reacted
to the previous boycott up until now.

319
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:26,485
Chairman Jang already knows
how incompetent Jang Geun-won is.

320
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:28,779
But he still chose him as his successor.

321
00:23:33,242 --> 00:23:36,203
Chairman Jang will never abandon his son.

322
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,581
We still have time.

323
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:42,001
It's always good to be careful.

324
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:44,336
Let's see how things turn out.

325
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:56,724
Mr. Jang gave his statement
based on the materials I gave him.

326
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:59,893
And the recording
didn't get chosen as evidence.

327
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:02,730
Even with the detective's confession

328
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:05,482
and this photo of the CCTV footage,

329
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:09,611
he'll be set free due to lack of evidence.
I think we have a chance here.

330
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:11,697
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

331
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,950
You can prove his innocence?

332
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:16,493
Yes, sir.

333
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:20,622
I'm relieved.

334
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:22,583
You're relieved?

335
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,919
Do you know what happened to the company

336
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:28,297
because of that mouth of yours?

337
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:30,716
Our stock price has decreased
by 12 percent.

338
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:33,719
Do you know how much money we've lost?

339
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:36,055
I'm...

340
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:37,723
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:42,728
Let's end it here. You may all leave.

342
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:46,482
Ms. Oh, I want you to stay.

343
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:49,735
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir?

344
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:52,196
Ask the secretary for some tea.

345
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:53,655
Yes, sir.

346
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:13,592
Nothing is going my way

347
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:16,261
because of my son.

348
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:20,682
Raising a child
is the hardest thing to do.

349
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:24,311
Sir.

350
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:28,399
You told me that you think of me
like family, right?

351
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:32,653
That's why I feel comfortable enough
to tell you how upset I am.

352
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,740
It's really difficult for me
to say this to you.

353
00:25:38,158 --> 00:25:39,243
But I think

354
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:42,996
you need to have your son dismissed.

355
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,710
You want me to dismiss Geun-won?

356
00:25:50,712 --> 00:25:51,713
Yes.

357
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,799
What are you saying? Didn't you hear?

358
00:25:54,716 --> 00:25:56,301
He can be proven innocent.

359
00:25:57,428 --> 00:25:59,138
It doesn't matter if he's innocent or not.

360
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,640
People are boycotting our products
due to the recording.

361
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,476
And what about your position
in the company?

362
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:10,941
If Ms. Kang decides to betray you
in this kind of situation,

363
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:12,860
it can be very dangerous for you.

364
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,655
There is only one way

365
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:18,907
to deal with this issue.

366
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:24,705
You must

367
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:29,168
take charge and dismiss your son.

368
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:45,976
Sit down.

369
00:26:57,404 --> 00:26:59,031
I haven't told you why I started

370
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,283
Jangga Co. yet, have I?

371
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:06,121
I was born as the eldest of four siblings

372
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:08,582
during such a turbulent period.

373
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:13,670
My youngest sibling starved to death.

374
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:16,965
And my other two siblings died

375
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,884
after eating rotten food
out in the street.

376
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,892
I built Jangga Co. so that my family

377
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:31,271
could eat good food
and will never have to starve again.

378
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:35,108
But you want me

379
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,445
to abandon

380
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:41,281
my own son?

381
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:45,202
That's absolute nonsense.

382
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:48,664
-But sir--
-A small business should know

383
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:50,707
the characteristics of the neighborhood.

384
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:55,045
And a good company should always be aware
of the current trend.

385
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:58,173
What about top leading companies
like Jangga Co.?

386
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:05,556
We need to know the characteristics
of the Korean people.

387
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:08,559
They get excited and bored with things
very easily.

388
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:10,602
They're quick to forget
everything that happens.

389
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,855
A 12 percent decrease in stock price?

390
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:17,150
Do you know how bad it was
eight years ago during the boycott?

391
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:19,611
It decreased by 37 percent.

392
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:23,532
It almost decreased by half,
but it came back to normal in six months.

393
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:24,992
Why?

394
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:28,328
It's the essence of a food company.

395
00:28:30,122 --> 00:28:31,164
It's because our products

396
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:33,250
are delicious.

397
00:28:40,215 --> 00:28:41,800
You think Min-jung will betray me?

398
00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:45,262
I'm sure she wants to be my successor.

399
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:46,513
But betraying me?

400
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,934
I'm the only person

401
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:54,313
who can represent Jangga Co.

402
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:58,734
And Min-jung knows that
better than anyone.

403
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:13,707
I apologize.

404
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,585
I was too thoughtless.

405
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:21,465
Don't you dare...

406
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,761
Don't you dare

407
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,597
tell me to abandon

408
00:29:30,557 --> 00:29:31,600
my family ever again.

409
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:46,239
HE THINKS YOU WANT TO BE THE SUCCESSOR

410
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:48,116
BUT HE DOESN'T THINK YOU WILL BETRAY HIM

411
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,341
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KANG MIN-JUNG

412
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,468
Hey, Ms. Kang.

413
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,136
Yes.

414
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:20,315
Then should we give it a shot?

415
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,874
They must be fucking crazy.

416
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:48,844
PROPOSAL TO DISMISS THE CHAIRMAN

417
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:50,887
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

418
00:30:56,518 --> 00:30:58,019
I'm glad you chose to do this.

419
00:30:59,354 --> 00:31:01,690
Jangga Co. is a company.

420
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:06,403
It's not just any company.
It's the top food company in our country.

421
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:10,615
We can't let the chairman's family matters
influence the company.

422
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,659
I don't feel comfortable

423
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:16,037
doing this to the chairman
since I've known him for so long--

424
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:21,042
-You fucking rats.
-What do you think you're doing?

425
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:28,842
A proposal to dismiss the chairman?

426
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:33,138
Are you crazy?

427
00:31:35,056 --> 00:31:37,225
-What did you say?
-How could you of all people

428
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,269
do this to my father?

429
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:41,688
He's done nothing wrong!

430
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:45,192
Guess why we're doing this.

431
00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:50,697
It's because of you.

432
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:54,576
We're doing this because he appointed
a fool like you as a director.

433
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,661
We're doing this
because he chose to protect you

434
00:31:57,704 --> 00:31:59,498
over the company.

435
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:05,587
-But you told me--
-I told you that the company

436
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:08,632
will take care of it.

437
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:13,136
And that's what we're doing.

438
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:16,681
Do you understand?

439
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:25,732
Let's carry on.

440
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:51,258
Soo-ah.

441
00:32:59,432 --> 00:33:01,268
I saw the proposal
to dismiss the chairman.

442
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,147
It's because of me.

443
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,484
-Because of me, my dad--
-I told him

444
00:33:11,528 --> 00:33:12,654
that he should

445
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:15,031
dismiss you.

446
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:20,245
But he got angry at me
and told me that he can't do that.

447
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,248
What?

448
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:25,792
"Water is thicker than blood."

449
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:29,087
I hate that saying more than anything.

450
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:34,301
But I guess it's true.

451
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:48,773
JANGGA CO. IN CRISIS
WILL CHAIRMAN JANG GET DISMISSED?

452
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:01,161
Are you okay?

453
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:06,374
Why? Are you worried about me?

454
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:07,792
What are you talking about?

455
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:11,546
But to be honest,
you do seem like the vulnerable type.

456
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,134
I thought

457
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:19,179
I'd be fine.

458
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,058
But I can't imagine

459
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:26,478
my dad breaking down.

460
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,650
I guess I never wanted to see it.

461
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:37,364
It's absurd,

462
00:34:38,281 --> 00:34:39,532
isn't it?

463
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:42,744
How could I feel this way

464
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:45,956
even when I know
what my dad has done to Saeroyi?

465
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:55,340
It's normal.

466
00:34:57,926 --> 00:34:58,843
Whatever they say,

467
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:02,722
he's still your dad.

468
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:12,732
JANGGA CO. IN CRISIS
WILL CHAIRMAN JANG GET DISMISSED?

469
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:17,028
I don't understand anything.

470
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:18,697
What's going to happen now?

471
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,657
Let me break it down for you.

472
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,410
The stockholders are going to vote

473
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:25,495
whether they want Chairman Jang
to get dismissed.

474
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:27,080
They're going to decide by majority.

475
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:32,168
Geun-soo is here.

476
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:48,643
We were talking about
Chairman Jang's dismissal.

477
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:50,687
Boss, come on.

478
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:52,480
I'm sure you know this.

479
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:54,816
Your dad is my enemy.

480
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:56,985
To make him pay for his sins

481
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:00,155
and become more successful than him
are my goals.

482
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,657
And in order to do that,

483
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:08,246
I will do anything.

484
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,874
Boss, you don't need to say that
in front of--

485
00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:12,208
You see...

486
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,590
I can't change my plan
because of how you might feel

487
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:20,633
or because I consider your feelings.

488
00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:23,887
And I don't want to.

489
00:36:26,806 --> 00:36:29,517
I'm sure you also don't want me
to do things that I don't mean.

490
00:36:30,977 --> 00:36:32,687
You knew everything
but still chose to stay.

491
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,583
I'm sorry.

492
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:56,002
I'm going to get some air.

493
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:02,801
Did you have to be so harsh?

494
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:21,277
This was bound to happen one day.

495
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:24,489
You know that, right?

496
00:37:39,796 --> 00:37:42,340
I can't change my plan
because of how you might feel

497
00:37:42,423 --> 00:37:44,467
or because I consider your feelings.

498
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:46,928
To make him pay for his sins

499
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:50,056
and become more successful than him
are my goals.

500
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:52,308
And in order to do that,

501
00:37:54,435 --> 00:37:55,562
I will do anything.

502
00:37:57,313 --> 00:37:58,398
<i>Everything he said is right.</i>

503
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:01,734
<i>On top of that,</i>

504
00:38:05,113 --> 00:38:06,281
<i>I was even impressed.</i>

505
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:10,368
But in the end,
you just turned out to be a loser

506
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:14,956
who had no balls to go after me
or the company.

507
00:38:30,263 --> 00:38:33,308
<i>If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,</i>

508
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:35,226
<i>you should</i>

509
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:37,437
<i>take over Jangga Co.</i>

510
00:38:38,938 --> 00:38:40,273
<i>So you're saying it's okay for me</i>

511
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:44,527
<i>to want you, right?</i>

512
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,662
NATIONAL COOKING CONTEST
SILVER PRIZE, JANGGA PUB

513
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:02,420
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

514
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:10,678
I thought I'd drop by
before heading to the prosecutor's office.

515
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:14,933
I'll tell them what Attorney Kang
told me to say.

516
00:39:16,184 --> 00:39:18,186
Then I can get back to work
starting from tomorrow.

517
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:20,772
Okay.

518
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:25,193
Dad.

519
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:27,862
-About the general meeting of--
-All my life,

520
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:31,324
I worked to build this company.

521
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:41,251
Jangga Co. is my life.

522
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:43,378
I, Jang Dae-hee, am

523
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:46,422
Jangga Co. itself.

524
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:49,133
Right.

525
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:51,928
No one can

526
00:39:53,096 --> 00:39:55,014
drive me out.

527
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:01,729
You take care of your own business.

528
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,273
Don't worry about me.

529
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:06,859
I'll see you later then.

530
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:09,404
Geun-won.

531
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:32,051
I always cared about handing
this company over to you.

532
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:37,098
So I've tried to discipline you.

533
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:40,935
But as your dad,

534
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:43,855
I've never given you

535
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:48,276
a warm hug even once.

536
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:20,475
Dad.

537
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,894
You should get going.

538
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,400
Mr. Kim, give him a ride.

539
00:41:31,486 --> 00:41:32,570
Yes, sir.

540
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:38,034
I'll see you later.

541
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:42,580
Dad.

542
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,834
Hang in there.

543
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:09,023
Let's get going then.

544
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:11,359
Pardon?

545
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:15,154
We still have four hours left.

546
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:46,853
How dare you come here?

547
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:51,732
I'm here to cast a vote as a shareholder.

548
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,152
To have Chairman Jang dismissed.

549
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,988
You jerk.

550
00:43:00,616 --> 00:43:01,826
Thank you.

551
00:43:05,037 --> 00:43:06,581
I couldn't see the end of it.

552
00:43:07,874 --> 00:43:09,667
But thanks to you, it seems possible.

553
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:13,838
Park Saeroyi!

554
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:15,506
Director Jang.

555
00:43:16,215 --> 00:43:18,134
You can't make things worse here.

556
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:21,596
We don't have time. Let's go.

557
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,399
We're not someone you can deal with.

558
00:43:33,983 --> 00:43:34,901
Me

559
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,028
and my dad.

560
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:39,572
Go ahead and get your own way.

561
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:41,908
And see if it works.

562
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:06,724
I can't calm myself down.

563
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,478
When does the shareholders' meeting begin?

564
00:44:11,103 --> 00:44:12,313
In three hours.

565
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:16,817
Gosh. I'm glad Geun-soo is off today.

566
00:44:17,443 --> 00:44:18,861
No matter how the result turns out,

567
00:44:19,362 --> 00:44:21,739
I don't know how to react in front of him.

568
00:44:22,657 --> 00:44:25,868
Boss said before. You don't have to do
things you don't mean.

569
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:27,370
I'm just being considerate.

570
00:44:28,204 --> 00:44:31,374
Both Saeroyi and you are so brutal.

571
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:33,876
Hey, guys. Hang on.

572
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:37,088
Look at this.

573
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:46,430
I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THE TROUBLE

574
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,644
PRESS CONFERENCE OF CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

575
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,331
Thank you all

576
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,627
for coming all the way here.
I'm Jang Dae-hee.

577
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:20,881
Today,

578
00:45:22,842 --> 00:45:24,969
I'm here as a father of a son,

579
00:45:25,886 --> 00:45:27,722
<i>not as the chairman...</i>

580
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:28,806
URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE

581
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:30,349
<i>...of Jangga Co.</i>

582
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:34,270
A press conference?

583
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:36,856
That old codger.

584
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:39,900
What is he up to?

585
00:45:41,652 --> 00:45:42,778
<i>First of all,</i>

586
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:46,324
<i>I'm sorry for all the trouble
my son has caused.</i>

587
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:48,326
<i>As his father...</i>

588
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:49,994
Dad.

589
00:45:50,077 --> 00:45:52,330
<i>I didn't discipline my son
in the right way.</i>

590
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:55,207
I deeply regret it

591
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:57,293
and apologize.

592
00:46:10,973 --> 00:46:12,099
My son

593
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:17,355
is suspected in a hit-and-run accident
from ten years ago,

594
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:21,651
so he's being questioned by prosecutors.

595
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:24,779
<i>According to our attorney,</i>

596
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:28,074
<i>there's not enough physical
and circumstantial evidence</i>

597
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:30,743
<i>against him.</i>

598
00:46:32,328 --> 00:46:33,245
<i>So my son is</i>

599
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:37,917
<i>going to be found not guilty.</i>

600
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:41,587
He will never be able
to win the shareholders over like that.

601
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:43,798
He's totally mistaken.

602
00:46:45,216 --> 00:46:47,259
A few days ago, when my son came back

603
00:46:47,343 --> 00:46:49,387
from the first prosecutor's investigation,

604
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:50,846
I...

605
00:46:57,895 --> 00:46:59,230
I heard it

606
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:04,318
from my son.

607
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:09,281
The hit-and-run accident
from ten years ago

608
00:47:15,454 --> 00:47:17,248
was his doing.

609
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:25,089
We're doomed.

610
00:47:47,236 --> 00:47:50,364
<i>With the money I trusted him with,</i>

611
00:47:51,323 --> 00:47:54,869
<i>he hired someone else...</i>

612
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:56,078
Pull over.

613
00:47:58,205 --> 00:48:00,458
<i>...to take the fault.</i>

614
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:02,376
CHAIRMAN JANG ADMITS HIS SON'S GUILT

615
00:48:04,336 --> 00:48:05,755
Did you not hear me?

616
00:48:06,547 --> 00:48:07,923
I told you to pull over.

617
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:10,593
I was ordered to drive you
to the Public Prosecutors' Office.

618
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:19,977
<i>I couldn't believe my ears.</i>

619
00:48:21,437 --> 00:48:22,480
That day,

620
00:48:23,814 --> 00:48:26,484
I looked into the case immediately

621
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:28,944
and found out

622
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,156
what my son said was true.

623
00:49:05,898 --> 00:49:08,150
Damn it.

624
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:12,112
What?

625
00:49:12,488 --> 00:49:13,948
<i>I am solely to blame for it.</i>

626
00:49:14,657 --> 00:49:17,159
I was so preoccupied
with running the company

627
00:49:17,243 --> 00:49:19,453
that I failed to discipline my son.

628
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:23,874
It's all my fault.

629
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:27,920
<i>What am I supposed
to do for my son's sake?</i>

630
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:32,132
<i>What is the right thing to do as a father?</i>

631
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,552
I'm a foolish father.

632
00:49:35,553 --> 00:49:38,848
I hesitated
even after finding out the truth.

633
00:49:40,307 --> 00:49:42,309
But feeling desperate,

634
00:49:43,143 --> 00:49:45,479
as soon as it turned out to be true,

635
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:52,403
I took all the evidence
to the prosecution.

636
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,780
Is it possible that he didn't know?

637
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,408
How is it even possible?

638
00:49:58,993 --> 00:50:01,287
<i>That's the last thing I can do</i>

639
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:05,624
<i>as a foolish father.</i>

640
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:08,502
<i>He must pay</i>

641
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:13,173
<i>for the crime he committed.</i>

642
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:33,152
To the victim who passed away
because of my son

643
00:50:34,528 --> 00:50:35,988
and his family,

644
00:50:37,197 --> 00:50:39,199
I sincerely apologize.

645
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:41,493
We will

646
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:45,205
regret it for the rest of our lives.

647
00:50:45,915 --> 00:50:47,291
I'm sorry.

648
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,044
I'm deeply sorry.

649
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:51,629
I'm sorry.

650
00:50:54,506 --> 00:50:55,466
I sincerely apologize.

651
00:50:58,218 --> 00:51:00,054
I'm terribly sorry.

652
00:51:11,273 --> 00:51:12,483
What's going on?

653
00:51:25,245 --> 00:51:27,748
-He's here.
-There he is.

654
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:31,210
-Where is your son?
-Is it true your son did it?

655
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,253
Are you not involved in the case?

656
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:34,755
What are your plans for the future?

657
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:36,882
Do the prosecutors know about this?

658
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:39,051
-Please say a word.
-Please answer it, sir.

659
00:51:39,134 --> 00:51:41,679
-Please tell us.
-Chairman Jang.

660
00:51:41,762 --> 00:51:43,847
-Hang on.
-Say something before you leave.

661
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:46,266
-Please answer the question.
-Chairman Jang.

662
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,018
Let me ask you one more question.

663
00:51:48,102 --> 00:51:50,396
-How are you feeling now?
-What are you going to do?

664
00:51:50,479 --> 00:51:52,648
-There's Jang Geun-won.
-What?

665
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:54,024
-Where?
-There he is.

666
00:51:54,858 --> 00:51:56,902
-Please say a word.
-Is it all true?

667
00:51:56,986 --> 00:51:59,989
-How are you feeling now?
-It's your father you reported you.

668
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:03,075
-Is what he said all true?
-How do you feel?

669
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:05,035
Were you alone in this?

670
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,204
Please say a word.

671
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:14,169
<i>As your dad,</i>

672
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:18,632
<i>I've never given you a warm hug even once.</i>

673
00:52:25,723 --> 00:52:26,890
<i>Is what your father said true?</i>

674
00:52:26,974 --> 00:52:29,643
<i>Your father reported you
to the prosecution.</i>

675
00:52:29,727 --> 00:52:32,479
<i>How are you feeling now?
Did you do it all alone?</i>

676
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:34,273
<i>Is your father not involved in the case?</i>

677
00:52:34,356 --> 00:52:36,191
<i>Please answer the question.</i>

678
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:37,336
Please answer the question.

679
00:53:41,673 --> 00:53:42,591
It's

680
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:47,012
all my fault.

681
00:53:47,096 --> 00:53:49,598
-Is it all correct?
-Wasn't your father involved?

682
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:52,392
-Do you admit the charge?
-How do you feel about your father?

683
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:05,531
<i>Therefore,</i>

684
00:54:09,827 --> 00:54:12,037
<i>the dismissal of the chairman</i>

685
00:54:18,585 --> 00:54:20,087
<i>is rejected.</i>

686
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:37,980
So we've fallen out with each other,

687
00:54:39,022 --> 00:54:40,566
but I have no grudge against you.

688
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:44,528
I believe you did
the whole thing for Jangga Co.

689
00:54:52,035 --> 00:54:53,203
Have some.

690
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:57,416
She makes really good tea.

691
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,502
Oh, right. It's you who planted her.
I guess you know it already.

692
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:09,720
Chairman Jang.

693
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:12,598
You may leave.

694
00:55:19,438 --> 00:55:21,231
When did you find out?

695
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:26,695
I thought you knew that I'd been prying.

696
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:30,657
You should've been more cautious.

697
00:55:31,617 --> 00:55:33,368
That was very clumsy of you.

698
00:55:35,662 --> 00:55:38,081
You just ended up getting paid back.

699
00:55:46,256 --> 00:55:47,424
You must be disappointed.

700
00:55:49,718 --> 00:55:51,386
Not really.

701
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:56,183
I just didn't know you were that good.

702
00:56:00,145 --> 00:56:01,939
It's not that I have grudge against you,

703
00:56:03,106 --> 00:56:05,150
but I'm quite disappointed.

704
00:56:05,234 --> 00:56:07,194
I can't kick you out though.

705
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:10,822
I will be too ashamed to face Bo-hyeon.

706
00:56:18,705 --> 00:56:20,832
What are you going to do?

707
00:56:23,418 --> 00:56:25,045
I'll transfer you to the Pajin office

708
00:56:26,755 --> 00:56:28,090
so you can clear your head.

709
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:47,985
JANGGA PUB

710
00:56:53,615 --> 00:56:54,908
Hey, my partner.

711
00:56:54,992 --> 00:56:56,159
Over here.

712
00:56:56,243 --> 00:56:57,244
Hey.

713
00:56:57,327 --> 00:56:59,288
Come have a seat.

714
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:02,374
I call you my partner,

715
00:57:02,457 --> 00:57:04,668
but we didn't even get to drink once.

716
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:06,253
Here.

717
00:57:06,753 --> 00:57:08,005
Let me pour you a drink.

718
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:14,261
I'm sorry. I didn't read it right.

719
00:57:14,344 --> 00:57:17,097
That just kills my appetite.
I told you to stop.

720
00:57:26,315 --> 00:57:27,607
What are you going to do now?

721
00:57:27,691 --> 00:57:29,067
I have no choice.

722
00:57:30,485 --> 00:57:32,904
All my people are kicked out.

723
00:57:36,658 --> 00:57:38,327
And I'll be banished.

724
00:57:38,744 --> 00:57:40,078
I'm sorry, Director Kang.

725
00:57:40,162 --> 00:57:43,790
Gosh, that's enough. Will you please stop?

726
00:57:56,595 --> 00:57:58,680
I need to go to the restroom.

727
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,183
I'm sorry.

728
00:58:04,644 --> 00:58:06,688
It was my decision.

729
00:58:06,813 --> 00:58:09,191
What is he sorry for?

730
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:13,528
So

731
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:16,323
what are you going to do now?

732
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,910
I will have to come up with another way.

733
00:58:19,993 --> 00:58:21,661
Another way?

734
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:24,831
You mean Chairman Jang?

735
00:58:31,713 --> 00:58:32,714
Yes.

736
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:41,056
Are you not going to give up
even after ruining the whole thing?

737
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:43,183
I'm not giving up.

738
00:58:48,146 --> 00:58:49,773
How could I give up?

739
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,944
The odds are stacked against you.

740
00:59:00,033 --> 00:59:02,119
The odds weren't with me
when I was a penniless ex-con

741
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:03,954
and a high school dropout.

742
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:07,874
I met a crushing defeat this time,

743
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:10,544
but Jang Geun-won will pay for his crime,

744
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:12,546
and Chairman Jang has lost his son.

745
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:17,134
I see. I lost everything though.

746
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:19,970
I'm a little sad.

747
00:59:23,265 --> 00:59:24,266
Right.

748
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:28,562
Actually, it's you who lost. Not me.

749
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:30,564
I'm sorry.

750
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:37,195
So I will keep on going.

751
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:45,704
Like I said before,

752
00:59:46,913 --> 00:59:48,665
you're such a jerk.

753
00:59:56,506 --> 00:59:57,591
This watch.

754
00:59:58,091 --> 00:59:59,926
It belonged to Mr. Park.

755
01:00:01,094 --> 01:00:02,095
Right.

756
01:00:02,554 --> 01:00:04,723
I wear this when I have
something important to do.

757
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:11,229
The 1997 IMF financial crisis.

758
01:00:11,313 --> 01:00:12,814
Jangga was in crisis. I mean,

759
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:16,067
the whole nation was facing a huge crisis.

760
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:20,530
And there was this dish
that saved Jangga Co. from the crisis.

761
01:00:22,908 --> 01:00:23,783
This one.

762
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:27,996
The spicy pork with <i>gochujang</i>.

763
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,540
I read it from the autobiography.

764
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:33,460
It's the signature menu of Jangga Co.
developed by Chairman Jang.

765
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:37,255
I heard it's made Jangga Co.
what it is now.

766
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,341
Right.

767
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,260
It's not too far-fetched to say

768
01:00:46,306 --> 01:00:49,893
that Jangga Co. wouldn't have come
this far without this special sauce.

769
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:55,148
Marketing always needs a good story.

770
01:00:55,815 --> 01:00:59,528
It's just more compelling to say

771
01:00:59,611 --> 01:01:03,448
that it was developed by the chairman,

772
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:06,535
not a mere employee.

773
01:01:08,954 --> 01:01:09,955
What?

774
01:01:12,165 --> 01:01:14,459
It's Mr. Park who made the sauce.

775
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:17,003
It's the dish developed by Mr. Park.

776
01:01:20,131 --> 01:01:23,635
And what he got in return
for giving credit to the chairman

777
01:01:24,469 --> 01:01:25,929
is this watch.

778
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:36,856
Mr. Park...

779
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:41,194
He should have been the last person
to be kicked out from Jangga like that.

780
01:01:47,284 --> 01:01:50,203
Like you said,
I'm the only one who lost this time.

781
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:53,873
I just gave up so easily after one defeat.

782
01:01:54,499 --> 01:01:56,293
I bet you'll be a lot better than me.

783
01:01:59,504 --> 01:02:00,630
Director Kang.

784
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:02,882
Give me your hand.

785
01:02:03,758 --> 01:02:04,676
What?

786
01:02:17,314 --> 01:02:19,149
I've passed the baton.

787
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:25,488
Make sure to win, Saeroyi.

788
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:42,797
The defendant was aware
that the victim was injured,

789
01:02:42,881 --> 01:02:44,758
but he ran away without rescue actions.

790
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:47,344
Also, even after he learned
that the victim had died,

791
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:48,720
he hired someone else

792
01:02:48,803 --> 01:02:51,514
to make a false statement
and cover up the case

793
01:02:51,598 --> 01:02:54,434
without turning himself in.

794
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:57,437
He has shown no remorse for his crime,

795
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,272
and the nature of the crime
is very serious.

796
01:02:59,648 --> 01:03:03,610
According to Article 54, Section 1
of the Road Traffic Act

797
01:03:03,902 --> 01:03:06,112
and Article 5, Section 3

798
01:03:06,196 --> 01:03:09,199
of the Additional Punishment Law
on Specific Crimes,

799
01:03:09,282 --> 01:03:12,160
the defendant is sentenced
to seven years in prison.

800
01:03:49,364 --> 01:03:50,740
You must be satisfied.

801
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,876
Not at all.

802
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:05,046
You're sitting comfortably right there.

803
01:04:17,308 --> 01:04:18,309
All right.

804
01:04:18,893 --> 01:04:22,063
Having Min-jung on your side
was a fine choice.

805
01:04:23,189 --> 01:04:26,067
But Jangga Co. won't fall apart so easily.

806
01:04:27,986 --> 01:04:29,237
I want to ask you.

807
01:04:30,822 --> 01:04:34,200
Is it something you want to protect
even giving up on your own son?

808
01:04:36,035 --> 01:04:37,245
I mean Jangga Co.

809
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:42,041
For Jangga Co.,
I'm willing to do anything.

810
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:45,044
But you know what?

811
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:48,631
I still feel quite bitter.

812
01:04:48,715 --> 01:04:50,633
He's just paying for what he did.

813
01:04:55,805 --> 01:04:57,807
You're crossing way over the line.

814
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:02,353
You haven't paid for what you did yet.

815
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:04,522
You are

816
01:05:06,441 --> 01:05:07,901
coming up next.

817
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:12,197
You told me before.

818
01:05:13,031 --> 01:05:14,908
That I'm your enemy.

819
01:05:16,826 --> 01:05:19,078
Fine. I admit it.

820
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:22,248
I, Jang Dae-hee,

821
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:25,794
have you for an enemy.

822
01:05:28,505 --> 01:05:29,506
I will

823
01:05:30,548 --> 01:05:32,509
make you regret this.

824
01:05:35,762 --> 01:05:36,763
I will

825
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,392
offer my life

826
01:05:43,186 --> 01:05:44,813
to make the same promise.

827
01:06:09,629 --> 01:06:11,422
It's so close by.

828
01:06:13,216 --> 01:06:15,093
But I couldn't come to see you even once.

829
01:06:19,973 --> 01:06:22,183
I'm a horrible son who went to jail

830
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,562
without finishing your funeral.

831
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:29,858
I felt too bad

832
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:35,029
to come see you.

833
01:06:39,617 --> 01:06:42,912
PARK SUNG-YEOL

834
01:06:47,584 --> 01:06:52,922
JANG GEUN-WON OF JANGGA CO. WHO TRIED TO
COVER UP HIS MURDER ENDS UP IN PRISON

835
01:07:06,352 --> 01:07:08,229
I was such a bad son,

836
01:07:11,316 --> 01:07:13,443
but I have a lot of good people around me.

837
01:07:18,573 --> 01:07:20,783
You must've been worried leaving me alone.

838
01:07:51,981 --> 01:07:53,566
But you don't have to worry anymore.

839
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:55,735
Please rest in peace.

840
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,132
<i>How does it taste?</i>

841
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:27,809
My son.

842
01:08:41,614 --> 01:08:42,615
It's still...

843
01:08:47,954 --> 01:08:49,163
bitter.

844
01:09:02,766 --> 01:09:08,746
Subtitle translation by Ja-won Lee

845
01:09:23,489 --> 01:09:25,408
I'll leave DanBam.

846
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:27,035
<i>You've been holding out well.</i>

847
01:09:27,118 --> 01:09:28,703
Why do you want to quit now?

848
01:09:28,786 --> 01:09:31,122
<i>I will live with greed.</i>

849
01:09:31,205 --> 01:09:33,458
<i>It's nice to meet you, Mr. Oh.</i>

850
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:36,669
<i>It's too soon to attract investment
to start something.</i>

851
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:39,005
-<i>When will we catch up with Jangga Co.?
-Yi-Seo.</i>

852
01:09:39,088 --> 01:09:41,632
<i>Did you have feelings for Yi-seo before?</i>

853
01:09:42,133 --> 01:09:44,427
<i>You're a smart girl.
Why are you acting like a kid?</i>

854
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:45,678
I love you.

855
01:09:46,179 --> 01:09:47,597
I really love you.
