ITAEWON CLASS

00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:12,338
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,923
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:15,466
What should we do?

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,218
-About what?
-Ma Hyun-yi.

6
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,553
People are responding negatively
to the article.

7
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,556
Hyun-yi should've at least
given us a heads-up.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,559
Well, I think it'd be better for us
to eliminate Hyun-yi.

9
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:27,144
And reduce Hyun-yi's airtime as well.

10
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,732
The judges will decide
whether or not Hyun-yi'll be eliminated.

11
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:32,983
Let's get started.

12
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:35,194
Let's go.

13
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:37,571
The survival match among the finest pubs.

14
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:40,408
We're here to find
the best pub in the country.

15
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:42,827
Among the 16 pubs
from all over the country,

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,705
only four are remaining.

17
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:47,707
This is the long-awaited final round.

18
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:52,878
Who will be named the best chef?

19
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:56,006
<i>The Best Pub</i> begins now.

20
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,471
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:06,934
I know it's cruel of me
to pressure you like this,

22
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:08,185
-but I--
-<i>No.</i>

23
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:11,731
The diamond.

24
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:18,738
You thought of me when you read that poem?

25
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,036
For Saeroyi,

26
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,831
you,

27
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,960
<i>and the DanBam family,</i>

28
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,338
<i>I will toughen up.</i>

29
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,804
<i>I'll stay strong.</i>

30
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,308
<i>You see,</i>

31
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,269
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

32
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,737
We've been using the blind testing method
since the third round.

33
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:02,656
The judges have no way of knowing
who made what.

34
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,784
All they care about is how good it tastes.

35
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:05,951
Just now,

36
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:09,872
the judges have completed
tasting all the foods.

37
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,626
First, let me interview Mr. Park Jun-gi,
Jangga Pub's head cook.

38
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,212
You've always received high scores.

39
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:18,422
Are you feeling confident
about today as well?

40
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,049
I've been doing this--

41
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:21,759
Look at... Oh, right.

42
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,094
I've been a cook all my life.

43
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,680
I did my best, as always.

44
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,267
You're a true pro.

45
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,354
Then let's speak with Ms. Ma Hyun-yi,

46
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:36,357
the head chef of DanBam
who's been on a winning streak.

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,943
You were named number one
for two weeks in a row.

48
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,820
How do you feel now?

49
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,121
DANBAM PUB

50
00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:57,878
Today,

51
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,132
something personal about me

52
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:08,514
was made public,
irrespective of my wishes.

53
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,272
Frankly, I'm not in the greatest mood.

54
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,485
Right, I see.
When you're in the showbiz...

55
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,404
-And you're awfully popular, so--
-I am

56
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,910
a transgender.

57
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,913
YOU GOT THIS! WE MUST WIN!

58
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,883
-For real?
-No way.

59
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,097
Yes, right.

60
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,516
A personal matter

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,144
was made public earlier today,
irrespective of her wishes.

62
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,814
Hyun-yi's probably quite upset about it.

63
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:02,401
But you're standing here now,
looking confident and strong.

64
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:05,112
I believe that this round

65
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:08,198
will be an opportunity for you
to prove yourself.

66
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:10,826
Prove myself?

67
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,467
I'm just me,

68
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,387
and I don't need anyone's approval
or validation.

69
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,140
I see.

70
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:38,646
Then could you tell us why you're here?

71
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,531
There are people who keep me strong.

72
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:55,704
I wanted to repay them
by making delicious food.

73
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,500
That's why I'm here.

74
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:03,212
That's very inspiring.

75
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:05,673
Your co-workers must be so proud of you.

76
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:10,386
How well do you think you'll do today?

77
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:13,305
They say,
birds of a feather flock together.

78
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,518
I work at the best pub in Korea

79
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,272
with the most wonderful people.

80
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:26,318
I, too,

81
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,030
will be the best.

82
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,034
In the previous round,
we all saw what Hyun-yi can do.

83
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:37,371
So I don't think Hyun-yi's just bluffing.

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,583
Let's find out
if the judges feel the same way.

85
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:45,295
The long-awaited final round.
The winner is...

86
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,202
We'll be back in 60 seconds!

87
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:26,257
<i>You're watching</i> The Best Pub <i>live.</i>

88
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:31,171
It's time to announce the final winner.

89
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,053
The winner is...

90
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:40,681
DANBAM PUB

91
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,186
<i>THE BEST PUB</i>

92
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:56,989
DanBam Pub's Ma Hyun-yi!

93
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,451
Congratulations!

94
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,709
FINAL WINNER
MA HYUN-YI, DANBAM PUB

95
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:16,133
Congratulations, Hyun-yi.

96
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:17,426
How do you feel--

97
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:24,224
Well done. Hyun-yi. Great job.

98
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:27,478
-Go, Hyun-yi!
-Seriously, great job.

99
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,859
-My gosh.
-We won!

100
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:38,363
-Gosh, this is so cool.
-Hyun-yi!

101
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:43,452
What did I say? Hyun-yi is so amazing!

102
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:45,913
Come here, guys.

103
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,254
MA HYUN-YI IS THE FINAL WINNER

104
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:58,425
Hyun-yi.

105
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,178
You're the best.

106
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:15,067
TRANSGENDER CHEF MA HYUN-YI
WINS THE COMPETITION

107
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,111
You assured me we'd win
when you took this on.

108
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,114
I'm sure you remember what you said to me.

109
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:22,658
What should we do?

110
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:26,036
What do you want me to do?

111
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,456
Ms. Oh.

112
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:32,042
What did he do to make sure we could win?

113
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:39,216
He made them do blind tests instead
when Ma Hyun-yi started becoming popular

114
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,427
and pressured Mr. Park,
who wasn't nervous at all.

115
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:45,722
Nevertheless, he ended up
ruining Jangga Co.'s reputation.

116
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:46,682
Is that all he did?

117
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:51,186
He also

118
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,773
leaked Ma Hyun-yi's private matter
to the media

119
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,818
to deliberately distract her.

120
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,574
For that, he deserves some points.

121
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,329
Geun-soo, you may leave.

122
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:17,754
I thought he left for good,
but he came back

123
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,134
and said he wants to run Jangga Co.

124
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:26,805
He wants to take over this role.

125
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,857
What's your thought on that?

126
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:42,487
Do you think he can be my successor?

127
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,496
He is

128
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,168
a lot like you, sir.

129
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:21,860
<i>So is this the high card you talked about?</i>

130
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:23,445
I did this to win.

131
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,031
Why do you have to--

132
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:48,387
Hold tight.

133
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:51,139
Let's go.

134
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:59,314
<i>Move to the rhythm,</i>

135
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:02,776
and make it seem like your body
accidentally brushed against hers.

136
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:07,155
There's nothing going on between us.
We're not dating.

137
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:10,117
We really are just friends.

138
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:15,080
But I like her.

139
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:19,960
<i>Yes.</i>

140
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:22,379
<i>I don't care what anyone says.</i>

141
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,135
<i>I just need you.</i>

142
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:31,513
Hey, what are you doing here?

143
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:34,016
You said you were in Jeju.
You're back already?

144
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,481
That story about Hyun-yi.

145
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:43,817
It was you, wasn't it?

146
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:52,617
I worked as a model for three years,
so I know dozens of reporters.

147
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,329
You didn't think I'd find out?

148
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,209
That's right. It was me.

149
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:03,587
What about it?

150
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:06,798
I was simply trying to win. That's all.

151
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,593
Was I supposed to keep it a secret

152
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,845
just because Hyun-yi and I
used to be close friends?

153
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,348
Would you have done that?

154
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,394
Just be yourself.

155
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:22,606
Being a pushover suits you better.

156
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,735
But you told me

157
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,322
"If you desperately want me

158
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:32,324
you should take over Jangga Co."

159
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:39,289
Later on, I said
that I was just talking nonsense.

160
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,002
-If that's why you're being like this--
-Bullshit.

161
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:54,888
I was so used to giving up,

162
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,016
but I made a choice for myself
for a change.

163
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,812
I ditched everything and chose this
because of what you said.

164
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,569
You can't do this to me.

165
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:14,533
You know,

166
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,994
I don't want to destroy you.

167
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,206
What?

168
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,085
A while ago,

169
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:28,213
Boss told me this.

170
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:30,757
When it comes to your feelings--

171
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,051
Again! I'm so sick of hearing you
talking about him!

172
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:37,389
I don't care what your amazing boss said.

173
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:39,307
It's already too late.

174
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:44,271
I can't stop now, Yi-seo.

175
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:46,106
I can't

176
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:54,781
hold back my feelings for you.

177
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:04,583
I'm sorry.

178
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:09,963
I can't accept your feelings.

179
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,135
Sorry.

180
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:17,596
I really am.

181
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,152
Hey, well...

182
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,696
I told you to get more rest.

183
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:19,449
We won <i>The Best Pub</i>,

184
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,327
and the investment has been confirmed
as well.

185
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:25,539
-Thanks for your hard work.
-That's it?

186
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:28,333
What?

187
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,585
You always pet my hair.

188
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:42,973
Oh, that...

189
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:50,522
I have to go draft the contract
for Ms. Kim. Let's go.

190
00:15:58,196 --> 00:15:59,489
Aren't you coming?

191
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:03,535
I am.

192
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:08,832
Watch the steps.

193
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:21,511
DANBAM

194
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:26,016
You won't regret
this investment decision, ma'am.

195
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:31,521
I'm a woman of her word.

196
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,524
Thank you.

197
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:37,193
You've made some promises too.

198
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,154
Keep your end of the bargain.

199
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,327
Your goal.

200
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:48,788
Becoming number one in Korea!

201
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,793
Of course. I'm a man of my word as well.

202
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:56,379
Good. I have faith in you.

203
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,345
INVESTMENT CONTRACT

204
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:09,142
KIM SOON-RYE

205
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:33,041
IC'S MOTTO HELPS THE COMPANY
SECURE 10 BILLION WON

206
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,085
Ten billion won?

207
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,046
Her boss is pretty impressive.

208
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,425
So your goal
is to help that owner with his business?

209
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:43,426
Then what?

210
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:45,387
Will you become a pub owner's wife?

211
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,971
That's not how I was raised.

212
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,432
Right.

213
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,187
That is not how I taught her.

214
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,148
I'm a lot more competent than you think.

215
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:04,739
That girl...

216
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,968
SEUNG-KWON

217
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:28,680
JANG GEUN-SOO

218
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:31,516
You won't answer it?

219
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,018
Yi-seo has found out

220
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:36,521
that I leaked it to the media.

221
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:40,650
I bet you're regretting what you did
while feeling bad about it.

222
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:43,319
Am I regretting it?

223
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:48,241
What do you think Saeroyi will say
if he finds out?

224
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:53,204
"Whatever you do,

225
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:55,498
I'll be just fine."

226
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,001
He'll probably say that.

227
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:03,006
Make sure you turn off the lights.

228
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,092
I know about what happened

229
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,636
between you and Saeroyi.

230
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:15,185
And I think I know
why you're working for Jangga Co.

231
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:20,982
You think nothing I do can affect him?

232
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:32,452
Do you know what I thought of
when I heard you say that?

233
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:35,205
What?

234
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,081
"What can I do

235
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,002
to take him down for good?"

236
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:47,258
You see,

237
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,678
I'm not like you.

238
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:55,475
Hey.

239
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:58,937
What are you thinking?

240
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:10,198
Jeez, why isn't this prick picking up?

241
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:13,201
Hey, let me pour you one.

242
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:15,829
There.

243
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:20,375
The sliding technique.
This is how beer should be poured.

244
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:24,546
-All right.
-Jeez.

245
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:26,297
Attention, everyone.

246
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,093
A while ago, Saeroyi said--

247
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:32,470
Gosh! Enough.

248
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:34,347
You talk about Boss all the time.

249
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,561
-Enough is enough, okay?
-Why? It sounds interesting. Tell us.

250
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:40,770
Right?

251
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:45,275
That's what I'm saying!
Hey, why are you so mean to me?

252
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:47,735
You're pretty, but so what?

253
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,741
Jeez, what the heck is he saying?

254
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:55,618
Whatever, forget it.

255
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:58,663
A while ago, Saeroyi said...

256
00:20:58,746 --> 00:20:59,831
"I'll do

257
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:05,753
everything I want to do."

258
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:07,630
He probably said that.

259
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,968
Yes. How did you know?

260
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:14,888
And he also said,

261
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:18,933
"I'll turn DanBam into a franchise!"

262
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:22,520
-Franchise? What?
-Goodness.

263
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:23,813
And what happened?

264
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,357
What happened, dude?

265
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:31,070
It became a reality today.

266
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:35,783
He fell asleep.

267
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:38,161
Hey, Saeroyi.

268
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:39,495
-Yes.
-All right.

269
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,581
Say a few words.

270
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:43,416
Okay.

271
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:47,879
Raise your glasses.

272
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,256
Thank you.

273
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,263
Thank you all

274
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:00,016
for your hard work.

275
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:02,602
What did I say?

276
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,188
When we work together,

277
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:08,274
can we succeed or not?

278
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,360
-We sure can!
-We sure can!

279
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:14,447
Who are we?

280
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,990
-IC!
-IC!

281
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:17,867
Yes, IC!

282
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:24,123
Jeez.

283
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,126
Do you guys know that?

284
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:32,632
Because I have you guys,

285
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:36,135
I...

286
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:39,806
I will

287
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,600
win.

288
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,912
And who's son am I?

289
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,918
My dad...

290
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:11,754
He said

291
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:18,886
he was proud of me.

292
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:22,432
Gosh, that's enough.

293
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:24,684
Guys, fill up your glasses.
This will be our last drink.

294
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:30,648
He's so proud of me.

295
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,779
Chairman Jang?

296
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:42,452
Jangga Co.? They can all come at me.

297
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:45,705
I'll beat them.

298
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:51,919
Gosh...

299
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,381
He drank too much.

300
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:01,888
I have no doubt that you'll beat them

301
00:24:03,181 --> 00:24:04,640
because you're our boss.

302
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:08,561
Right?

303
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:13,274
I'll win this fight, right?

304
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:15,443
Yes.

305
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:17,445
Without a doubt.

306
00:24:28,748 --> 00:24:29,665
Saeroyi.

307
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,542
-Gosh.
-Boss.

308
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:34,003
-Saeroyi!
-Oh, no. He's out.

309
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,255
He passed out. Gosh, don't do this to me.

310
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:37,882
Please, Saeroyi...

311
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:40,551
Wake up.

312
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:46,099
DANBAM

313
00:25:22,677 --> 00:25:23,761
You're still

314
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:27,515
hurt, right?

315
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:56,043
<i>You assured me that we'd win</i> The Best Pub,

316
00:25:56,627 --> 00:25:58,921
but Park Saeroyi's pub did.

317
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:01,424
And thanks to that,

318
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:05,595
he has secured an investment.

319
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:10,266
Park Jun-gi has been let go.

320
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:26,574
The meeting will begin
in ten minutes, sir.

321
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:31,412
We'll stop here.

322
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:33,956
It was a good game.

323
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:36,125
Follow me.

324
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,254
You'll join the meeting.

325
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:01,567
As some of you may know,

326
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:04,070
he's my younger son.

327
00:27:06,197 --> 00:27:09,408
He's tall and handsome just like you, sir.

328
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,205
I'm thinking of

329
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:16,332
passing down the company to him.

330
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:22,797
Introduce yourself.

331
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:30,429
Hello, I'm Jang Geun-soo
in the planning team.

332
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:32,348
I'll do my best.

333
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:52,034
Hello, boss!

334
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:55,705
Hello, boss!

335
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:10,886
Well, don't cause trouble.

336
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,264
I'll be out soon anyway.

337
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:15,308
Don't you worry.

338
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,981
-Hello, boss.
-Hello, boss.

339
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:23,149
Hi, guys.

340
00:28:29,947 --> 00:28:31,073
Who's that?

341
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,081
Hey, shouldn't you at least

342
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:41,208
greet your new cellmate?

343
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,920
YOUNGER SON JANG GEUN-SOO BECOMES
MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER OF JANGGA CO.

344
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:05,524
We've already received
hundreds of franchise inquiries.

345
00:29:05,608 --> 00:29:09,028
After organizing the company structure
and taking care of all the locations,

346
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:10,613
we'll still have seven billion.

347
00:29:11,197 --> 00:29:12,615
We should expand nationwide.

348
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:15,034
Nationwide...

349
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,203
Gosh, things are finally becoming stable.

350
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:19,372
We'll do things step by step.

351
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:22,291
Congratulations.
Your dream has become a reality.

352
00:29:25,127 --> 00:29:27,546
Working on a fishing boat,
doing construction work...

353
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:32,301
It was so hard to make
100 million won from nothing.

354
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:34,720
Why are you suddenly being so sentimental?

355
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:37,973
He deserves to be sentimental.
It's a great achievement.

356
00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:40,267
Boss, you did great.

357
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:43,396
No, wait. That's not right.
Should I call you President Park now?

358
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:50,653
But once I had 100 million won,
I easily made that into billions.

359
00:29:52,488 --> 00:29:55,032
The Korean capital market
is very interesting.

360
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:57,911
Low risk, high rate.

361
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,871
The more money you have,
the more that makes sense.

362
00:30:02,706 --> 00:30:04,625
Are you saying we should do stocks?

363
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:10,631
Now that we have big money,

364
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:13,801
we should play big.

365
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:17,513
What's this?

366
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:20,015
SHANGHAI FRANCHISE EXPO
GATHERING PARTICIPANTS

367
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:22,309
They're going to hold
a franchise expo in China.

368
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,061
"China"?

369
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:26,063
No way.

370
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:33,028
Let's not just go national.
Let's start from China and go global.

371
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:38,242
Let's turn ten billion
into hundreds of billions.

372
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:40,953
What?

373
00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:43,289
Like I told Toni's grandmother,

374
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,124
this is not the end of my dream.

375
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,294
My dream is to beat Jangga Co.
and become the best in the country.

376
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:51,714
So I should act accordingly.

377
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:55,009
This is just the beginning.

378
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,100
You never disappoint me, boss.

379
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:34,131
4 YEARS LATER, THE YEAR 2020

380
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:45,077
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

381
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,707
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

382
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,916
Hello, sir.

383
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,751
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

384
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:10,603
<i>You want to spend three billion won</i>

385
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:12,479
on another partner company?

386
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,567
Masa Distribution isn't
doing very well right now.

387
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,819
We are not philanthropists.

388
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,613
I'm saying it'll be more efficient

389
00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:23,032
to build <i>guanxi</i> with a new company
than to help a dying one.

390
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:26,577
What do you think, Director Choi?

391
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,746
What? Oh, right.

392
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:30,372
Well...

393
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:34,084
I understand what you mean, Mr. Gwon.

394
00:33:34,168 --> 00:33:37,713
But Masa Distribution
helped us enter the Chinese market.

395
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:40,424
Wouldn't this be an act of betrayal?

396
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:42,509
That's nonsense.

397
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:45,220
We can't do business based on attachment.

398
00:33:45,304 --> 00:33:49,516
Then is investing three billion won
on a new company to build <i>guanxi</i>

399
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:51,310
the right way to do business?

400
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,355
I don't think you understand.

401
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:57,149
In China, business
is all about building <i>guanxi</i>.

402
00:33:57,232 --> 00:33:59,485
Three billion won will bring us
a huge benefit.

403
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:01,820
Reading documents in the office

404
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:04,031
and actually seeing things in person

405
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:05,949
bring very different results.

406
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:08,077
Seeing things in person?

407
00:34:10,204 --> 00:34:12,414
You keep talking about <i>guanxi</i>.

408
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,958
But are you sure you know what that means?

409
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:16,585
Pardon?

410
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:18,879
It means "relationship."

411
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,008
The eldest son of Masa Distribution
is apparently getting married.

412
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:25,594
Do you know who he's marrying?

413
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:32,559
The second daughter of Tancent's chairman.
It's a huge online platform company.

414
00:34:35,354 --> 00:34:38,732
It looks like neither of you knew.

415
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:41,777
How could you not know when you're
always experiencing things in person?

416
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,071
Almost everyone
has heard the news already.

417
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:46,281
-Well...
-Then

418
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,452
which company will benefit us
in the long run?

419
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:59,461
Okay then. It's time to decide.

420
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:01,714
What's the philosophy of our company?

421
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:04,383
The importance of relationship and trust.

422
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:07,970
It looks that our philosophy
is going to help us gain profit.

423
00:35:08,595 --> 00:35:10,305
We'll invest in Masa Distribution
as planned.

424
00:35:11,098 --> 00:35:11,974
Okay, sir.

425
00:35:25,612 --> 00:35:27,740
I can't stand this.
This really doesn't suit me.

426
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:30,784
Boss, can I go back to working at a pub?

427
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:32,661
You're doing great.

428
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:34,788
"Boss"?

429
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:39,626
Will you please call him by his rank
when you're at work, Director Choi?

430
00:35:40,961 --> 00:35:42,004
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:47,634
Hyun-yi, we're treating a Chinese buyer
at the end of this month.

432
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:50,095
-Can you cook for us that day?
-Sure.

433
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:52,264
Why are you calling her by her name
when we're at work?

434
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:53,557
We're different.

435
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:56,435
Hey, call me Director Choi.
We're at work right now.

436
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:01,648
What's this?

437
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:04,151
You have a meeting with the director
of Maparam in 30 minutes.

438
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,653
There might be an argument,
so use this as reference.

439
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:10,032
And in two hours, you have dinner
scheduled with the CEO of Gojoseon Hotel.

440
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:13,786
Isn't he meeting the store owners
at our franchise seminar in the evening?

441
00:36:14,244 --> 00:36:15,788
I don't think it'll take long.

442
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,498
He can go right after dinner.

443
00:36:17,831 --> 00:36:19,500
-This is your schedule for tomorrow.
-Okay.

444
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:23,295
What's with the crazy schedule?

445
00:36:23,378 --> 00:36:24,463
He'll lose it.

446
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:28,634
-Is it exhausting?
-No.

447
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:31,011
Boss, don't be like that.

448
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:34,848
-We've settled down--
-You think we've settled down?

449
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:37,810
We're the second most-liked brand.

450
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:40,437
We're ninth in annual sales
and sixteenth in market capitalization.

451
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:42,481
That's our position in the food industry.

452
00:36:42,564 --> 00:36:44,191
Jangga Co. is number one for everything.

453
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:46,652
I want to be number one.

454
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:49,071
And Yi-seo is planning things out
so I can achieve that.

455
00:36:51,198 --> 00:36:52,783
This is what made me fall for him.

456
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:55,118
I told you to stop.

457
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:59,081
You're so persistent.

458
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:01,917
I was going to gather everyone
and go for a drink.

459
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,794
We had a company dinner two days ago.

460
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:05,504
Geun-soo is back.

461
00:37:06,338 --> 00:37:08,465
Jang Geun-soo?

462
00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:10,217
Where was he?

463
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:25,941
He was at an overseas branch.
I think it was the US branch.

464
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:28,068
You guys keep in touch?

465
00:37:28,151 --> 00:37:30,445
Yes, of course. He's a nice guy.

466
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:32,281
I think he was lonely working overseas.

467
00:37:32,364 --> 00:37:34,241
Haven't you heard from him, boss?

468
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:37,077
No, I haven't seen him in ages.

469
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,537
I wonder if he's doing well.

470
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:41,665
Director Jang.

471
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:55,470
Do I really need to be your driver
at this age?

472
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:58,724
You're my mentor.

473
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:03,103
My gosh,
I'm starting to hate you even more.

474
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,610
VOICE RECORDING

475
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:12,654
<i>Saeroyi goes to Pajin
very often these days.</i>

476
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:15,365
<i>Pajin? Does he go there to meet Ms. Kang?</i>

477
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:18,327
<i>I think so. They're really close.</i>

478
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:20,871
<i>Hye-won surprises me.</i>

479
00:38:20,954 --> 00:38:22,497
She's taller every time I see her.

480
00:38:22,998 --> 00:38:24,583
She always surprises me, too.

481
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,461
It feels like yesterday
when she was only a little kid.

482
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:29,713
She's going through a growth spurt.

483
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:33,800
"A growth spurt"?

484
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:37,721
I totally agree.
She's going through a growth spurt.

485
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,932
Which part of what I said was so funny?

486
00:38:40,891 --> 00:38:43,894
Well, I just liked...

487
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,314
You like me?

488
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:49,858
No.

489
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:52,194
That's absurd.

490
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:55,948
You didn't have to pull a straight face.

491
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,285
I mean... Well...

492
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:03,622
Do you want to see photos of Hye-won
when she was little?

493
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:04,706
Sure.

494
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:06,875
Isn't she pretty?

495
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,293
OH HYE-WON

496
00:39:08,377 --> 00:39:09,836
She never looked like you.

497
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,506
<i>This is Jangmun Market Street.</i>

498
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:16,385
It almost got redeveloped ten years ago,
but it got canceled.

499
00:39:16,677 --> 00:39:20,055
And right now, lots of places are empty
regardless of the cheap rent.

500
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:22,224
Why do you think so?

501
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:26,770
Most of the landlords
even put their buildings up for sale.

502
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:30,315
Apart from a few buildings,

503
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:32,192
we can purchase most of the buildings

504
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:36,655
from here to here
with only 40 billion won.

505
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,408
You want to spend 40 billion won
on a place that's dead?

506
00:39:40,575 --> 00:39:41,994
Isn't that too much money?

507
00:39:45,497 --> 00:39:47,290
We're going to fill all those buildings

508
00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:50,085
with Jangga Co.'s brands
and affiliated companies.

509
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:53,088
We’ll redecorate the filthy buildings

510
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,548
with bright

511
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:57,134
and unified murals

512
00:39:57,718 --> 00:39:59,052
and turn it into a popular street

513
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:00,512
like Gyeongridan-gil Road

514
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,556
and Songridan-gil Road.

515
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:07,686
We’re Jangga Co., so we could call it

516
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:09,604
Jangridan Street.

517
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,982
We’re investing billions of won,

518
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:13,233
but how long will that last?

519
00:40:13,316 --> 00:40:14,776
Streets like that

520
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,071
tend to lose popularity very quickly.

521
00:40:18,155 --> 00:40:19,364
Yes.

522
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:21,074
But when those streets

523
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:24,745
were at their very peak,
the rent in those areas

524
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,538
almost quadrupled.

525
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:30,751
The 40-billion-won investment
will turn into 120 billion,

526
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:34,629
and our brand value
will eventually increase.

527
00:40:39,593 --> 00:40:41,511
What will we do when the street

528
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:43,138
loses its value?

529
00:40:44,181 --> 00:40:46,141
We’re going to increase the value

530
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:49,728
and sell the buildings at their peak.

531
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:53,398
Wouldn’t that hurt our brand image?

532
00:40:53,482 --> 00:40:54,566
No.

533
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:57,277
That’s when the marketing team steps in.

534
00:40:58,445 --> 00:41:01,823
“The area was high in value
when Jangga Co. was here,

535
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:05,368
but now that they’re gone,
it has lost its popularity again.”

536
00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:07,829
Then people will think once again

537
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:09,956
that Jangga Co.

538
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,585
is truly incredible.

539
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:19,466
Okay.

540
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:21,468
You can proceed with it.

541
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:22,928
Thank you, sir.

542
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:37,192
This is a street renovation project,

543
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:39,319
so we need to be on good terms
with the borough chief.

544
00:41:39,402 --> 00:41:40,821
You should meet him next month

545
00:41:40,904 --> 00:41:42,656
when he comes
to our groundbreaking ceremony.

546
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:44,950
Okay, sure.

547
00:41:45,492 --> 00:41:47,869
Let's talk about the rest over dinner.

548
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:51,206
I need to go to Jangmun Market with Mr. Oh
and meet the merchants there.

549
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:52,165
I see.

550
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:53,959
Okay.

551
00:41:59,756 --> 00:42:03,009
Park Saeroyi and IC Co.

552
00:42:06,763 --> 00:42:08,723
His business has grown so big.

553
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:12,269
Does he still bother you?

554
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:15,856
He'll come at us one day.

555
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,858
Don't let your guard down.

556
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:21,653
You don't look well.

557
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:23,238
You should get some rest.

558
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,002
Jangga Co. is going to revive
a market street?

559
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:39,171
They're trying to promote
their gentrification plan.

560
00:42:40,672 --> 00:42:44,342
Director Jang Geun-soo seems to have
a good reputation in the company.

561
00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:46,344
He's nothing like Geun-won.

562
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:49,347
He's practically the successor.

563
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:55,270
Are you sure it's a good idea
for you to stay here in Pajin?

564
00:42:57,063 --> 00:42:58,940
I'm powerless now.

565
00:42:59,524 --> 00:43:00,942
What else can I do?

566
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,862
What about Saeroyi?
What is he up to these days?

567
00:43:20,962 --> 00:43:22,047
Yi-seo.

568
00:43:26,843 --> 00:43:29,012
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Why do you think?

569
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:32,974
Why are you shopping online in my office?

570
00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:35,101
Sir, take a look at this necklace.

571
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:37,646
Isn't it so pretty? It looks like a smile.

572
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:41,650
Yes, it's pretty.
And it does look like a smile.

573
00:43:41,816 --> 00:43:43,401
Buy it in your own office.

574
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:48,448
Can you buy it for me tomorrow?

575
00:43:53,703 --> 00:43:55,205
Don't I have a busy schedule tomorrow?

576
00:43:55,288 --> 00:43:58,541
Right. Then I guess tomorrow won't work.

577
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,211
When do you think you'll be free?
When should we go to buy it?

578
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:04,214
-Yi-seo.
-Stop.

579
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:06,341
I told you

580
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:09,427
that it's my right to keep liking you.

581
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:13,473
Yes, I get that's how you feel.
But what about me?

582
00:44:18,853 --> 00:44:20,063
You're right.

583
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:23,942
You don't like me yet.

584
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,777
So you must feel uneasy about it.

585
00:44:27,362 --> 00:44:28,947
-If you get that--
-But unfortunately,

586
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,785
I like you so much
that it drives me crazy.

587
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:37,497
-Hey--
-Wait.

588
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,832
Like I said,

589
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:40,333
you can fire me for this.

590
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:41,960
If it makes you uneasy, then go ahead.

591
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:43,962
But I'm so good at what I do,

592
00:44:44,045 --> 00:44:46,298
so you probably can't fire me,
so that's a real pity.

593
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:52,887
What's the trouble?

594
00:44:54,723 --> 00:44:56,683
It's not like you don't have a choice.

595
00:45:01,146 --> 00:45:03,023
You just need to accept
my feelings for you.

596
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,196
What is wrong with you?

597
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,326
What?

598
00:45:15,618 --> 00:45:17,078
Should I come back a little later?

599
00:45:17,162 --> 00:45:18,246
No.

600
00:45:18,955 --> 00:45:20,540
I'll go check some buildings in Itaewon.

601
00:45:20,623 --> 00:45:21,791
Okay, go ahead.

602
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:30,050
I love you.

603
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:31,676
Hey, what...

604
00:45:37,307 --> 00:45:39,517
Gosh, it's way past working hours.

605
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:41,478
I came to ask for your signature.

606
00:45:41,561 --> 00:45:43,897
Yes, of course. I should sign this.

607
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,359
<i>BAEGA DANDAN</i>
FIRST QUARTER SETTLEMENT

608
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,611
That's a nice pen.

609
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,031
Oh, this? Yi-seo got it for me
for my last year's birthday.

610
00:45:53,114 --> 00:45:54,157
I see.

611
00:45:55,575 --> 00:45:56,409
What about you?

612
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,537
What?

613
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:02,082
What did you get for Yi-seo last year

614
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:04,626
on her birthday?

615
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:06,438
Jang Geun-won.

616
00:47:41,598 --> 00:47:42,807
Who are you?

617
00:48:06,206 --> 00:48:07,957
Is porridge enough, sir?

618
00:48:12,795 --> 00:48:13,796
I don't have

619
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:16,633
an appetite these days.

620
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:20,470
You don't look very well.

621
00:48:21,137 --> 00:48:22,847
I'll schedule an appointment with Dr. Kim.

622
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,225
Okay, go ahead.

623
00:48:29,437 --> 00:48:30,855
I didn't know you were eating.

624
00:48:31,523 --> 00:48:32,649
Why are you here?

625
00:48:32,732 --> 00:48:35,026
I'm planning to eat
with the borough chief tomorrow.

626
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:36,611
I was wondering if you could make it.

627
00:48:37,195 --> 00:48:38,071
Well...

628
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:39,531
Director Jang.

629
00:48:41,074 --> 00:48:43,493
The chairman isn't
in his best condition right now.

630
00:48:49,624 --> 00:48:51,042
Don't you feel well?

631
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:57,090
The borough chief is very particular.

632
00:48:59,425 --> 00:49:00,552
On top of that,

633
00:49:00,802 --> 00:49:02,887
You are the figurehead of Jangga Co.

634
00:49:03,555 --> 00:49:06,558
Once you meet him,
things will go a lot easier.

635
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:08,184
Director Jang.

636
00:49:09,018 --> 00:49:11,229
-Tomorrow, Chairman Jang will...
-It's okay.

637
00:49:11,312 --> 00:49:13,690
He says I can make things easier.

638
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,195
I should go then.

639
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:22,115
Thank you. I'll come back tomorrow
to pick you up...

640
00:49:45,555 --> 00:49:46,556
Chairman Jang.

641
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:47,807
Chairman Jang.

642
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:50,643
Chairman Jang.

643
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:52,520
Chairman Jang.

644
00:49:53,187 --> 00:49:54,355
Chairman Jang.

645
00:49:59,223 --> 00:50:00,933
HANGUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

646
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:02,351
<i>Pancreatic cancer?</i>

647
00:50:03,435 --> 00:50:04,520
What about surgery?

648
00:50:05,104 --> 00:50:06,772
Will he get better after surgery?

649
00:50:07,273 --> 00:50:09,858
The cancer spread to the lymphatic gland
and blood vessels.

650
00:50:10,943 --> 00:50:13,946
And it might metastasize
to the liver and lungs.

651
00:50:14,029 --> 00:50:15,614
Considering Chairman Jang's age,

652
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:18,617
it is best to treat it
with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

653
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:20,703
But practically...

654
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:23,247
How much time does he have left?

655
00:50:24,248 --> 00:50:27,668
I can't tell you how long it will be.

656
00:50:28,002 --> 00:50:29,587
It varies from person to person.

657
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,297
I just need your opinion.

658
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:37,886
It may be for about six months.

659
00:50:41,265 --> 00:50:42,266
Half a year?

660
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:51,233
You should've called me
as soon as you got out.

661
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:53,944
What took you so long?

662
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:56,363
I know.

663
00:50:57,031 --> 00:50:58,866
I hesitated.

664
00:51:00,284 --> 00:51:02,119
You didn't come to see me even once.

665
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:05,914
I wasn't sure if it was okay to call you
when I'm abandoned.

666
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:10,294
I see.

667
00:51:11,962 --> 00:51:14,173
You must've resented me.

668
00:51:15,341 --> 00:51:17,509
Do you want me to apologize or something?

669
00:51:18,093 --> 00:51:19,470
It's been four years.

670
00:51:23,932 --> 00:51:26,644
How could you say that to your son
you just met in four years?

671
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:39,323
When did you come?

672
00:51:43,744 --> 00:51:45,746
Are you feeling better?

673
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:50,417
Mr. Kim told me.

674
00:51:52,169 --> 00:51:54,171
I have half a year left.

675
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,759
But it depends on the person.

676
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:00,969
When I was with him,

677
00:52:01,053 --> 00:52:03,013
I had him get a checkup every year.

678
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:07,685
Is that my job as the director?

679
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:09,353
Stop it.

680
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:16,944
I stopped this from getting reported,

681
00:52:17,027 --> 00:52:18,904
but it will be important
to control the press.

682
00:52:19,863 --> 00:52:20,864
Okay.

683
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,991
The doctor says

684
00:52:25,744 --> 00:52:28,038
there's no point in getting treatment.

685
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:37,131
Can't you go to work?

686
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:40,509
What?

687
00:52:41,093 --> 00:52:43,512
-Succession due to ill health will--
-Jang Geun-soo.

688
00:52:45,347 --> 00:52:47,391
...lead to a fall in stock prices.

689
00:52:50,644 --> 00:52:52,312
You should name the next chairman

690
00:52:52,813 --> 00:52:55,983
when you are in good condition.

691
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,739
You've become interesting.

692
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:03,240
Stop it.

693
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,243
And you haven't changed.

694
00:53:07,745 --> 00:53:09,705
-You think?
-I said stop.

695
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:23,051
I will meet with the borough chief
by myself.

696
00:53:24,136 --> 00:53:25,971
Get some rest, Chairman Jang.

697
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:47,618
You made him become

698
00:53:49,077 --> 00:53:50,162
just like you.

699
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:56,001
That's why

700
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:02,007
he deserves to take my seat.

701
00:54:06,178 --> 00:54:07,429
I'm telling you

702
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,599
I don't regret what I did that day.

703
00:54:14,228 --> 00:54:15,354
I did it

704
00:54:17,064 --> 00:54:19,399
for Jangga Co.'s sake.

705
00:54:23,237 --> 00:54:24,863
You haven't changed.

706
00:54:26,073 --> 00:54:28,116
It's all about Jangga Co.

707
00:54:33,413 --> 00:54:34,957
I wonder what it is for.

708
00:54:37,918 --> 00:54:38,919
Get some rest.

709
00:54:48,554 --> 00:54:49,721
Actually,

710
00:54:53,392 --> 00:54:55,310
I know the reason

711
00:54:57,479 --> 00:54:58,814
why my life has come this way.

712
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:09,533
I will protect Jangga Co.

713
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,704
that you cherish.

714
00:55:46,445 --> 00:55:47,279
Soo-ah.

715
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:50,115
Saeroyi.

716
00:55:53,493 --> 00:55:54,786
What are you doing here?

717
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:56,705
Were you waiting for me?

718
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:58,540
I was just passing by.

719
00:55:58,624 --> 00:55:59,708
It's close.

720
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:02,252
You should've called me.
It's cold outside.

721
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:19,853
Hey, where are you now?

722
00:56:19,937 --> 00:56:21,146
I'm in Itaewon.

723
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,732
I ran into Soo-ah.

724
00:56:24,524 --> 00:56:25,525
Now?

725
00:56:28,445 --> 00:56:29,404
Hang on.

726
00:56:32,407 --> 00:56:35,744
Can we go to Seok-cheon's
restaurant next time?

727
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:38,163
-Well...
-I see.

728
00:56:38,246 --> 00:56:40,832
It's okay. It seems urgent.

729
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,588
Okay. I'll be right there.

730
00:56:46,672 --> 00:56:47,756
Okay.

731
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,720
I'm sorry. We met after a long time.

732
00:56:53,804 --> 00:56:55,514
It's really okay.

733
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:57,975
The whole world knows that you are busy.

734
00:56:58,558 --> 00:57:00,185
I should get going then. See you.

735
00:57:00,268 --> 00:57:01,687
Bye.

736
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:30,007
It's been a long time.

737
00:57:32,259 --> 00:57:33,260
I know.

738
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:36,346
I was on a date with Saroyi.

739
00:57:38,724 --> 00:57:40,058
I saw the whole thing.

740
00:57:43,437 --> 00:57:45,355
You got stood up.

741
00:57:46,898 --> 00:57:50,027
When are you going to let go of him?

742
00:57:52,446 --> 00:57:54,281
Let go of him?

743
00:57:55,407 --> 00:57:57,492
You should say that to Saeroyi.

744
00:57:58,702 --> 00:58:01,204
I said I didn't want a poor guy.

745
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,498
So he said he'd become rich.

746
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:06,001
He will destroy Jangga Co.

747
00:58:06,084 --> 00:58:08,211
and make me unemployed.

748
00:58:08,295 --> 00:58:10,464
So I won't have a hard time anymore.

749
00:58:13,842 --> 00:58:15,218
What's wrong with you?

750
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:20,682
You were always like,
"Saeroyi likes me anyway."

751
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:23,810
I've never seen you
feel so nervous like that.

752
00:58:30,817 --> 00:58:32,069
You are afraid

753
00:58:34,237 --> 00:58:36,573
that Boss might fall in love with me.

754
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,536
It's

755
00:58:43,413 --> 00:58:45,248
so disgusting.

756
00:58:47,584 --> 00:58:50,253
-What?
-"Come to me after you become rich."

757
00:58:50,337 --> 00:58:52,380
"Destroy Jangga Co.
so I won't have a hard time."

758
00:58:52,464 --> 00:58:54,341
You only care about yourself.

759
00:58:54,925 --> 00:58:57,969
You just keep asking for things

760
00:58:58,136 --> 00:59:00,138
while you aren't doing anything.

761
00:59:02,432 --> 00:59:03,558
What...

762
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:06,311
What do you know?

763
00:59:06,394 --> 00:59:07,479
I know

764
00:59:09,523 --> 00:59:11,066
at least one thing.

765
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:15,403
Who loves Boss more.

766
00:59:16,404 --> 00:59:17,823
Do you know

767
00:59:18,448 --> 00:59:20,492
how I felt when I talked to him?

768
00:59:21,701 --> 00:59:22,661
"Rich?"

769
00:59:23,453 --> 00:59:25,080
"I will make you rich."

770
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,333
"Jangga Co. gives you a hard time?"

771
00:59:29,918 --> 00:59:31,628
"I will destroy them for you."

772
00:59:36,341 --> 00:59:37,217
You...

773
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:42,180
If you

774
00:59:44,182 --> 00:59:48,436
care about him at least a little,

775
00:59:49,354 --> 00:59:50,355
you should

776
00:59:51,731 --> 00:59:52,941
keep

777
00:59:54,818 --> 00:59:56,653
staying still like that

778
00:59:57,654 --> 00:59:58,655
doing nothing.

779
01:00:14,588 --> 01:00:15,922
<i>What's the matter?</i>

780
01:00:16,673 --> 01:00:19,718
Good for you. You were on a date
with a manager from Jangga Co.

781
01:00:22,512 --> 01:00:24,055
Why are you being so sensitive?

782
01:00:25,891 --> 01:00:27,100
About your dad

783
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:29,978
and your grudges against Jangga Co.

784
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,063
You didn't forget them, did you?

785
01:00:40,155 --> 01:00:41,489
I met Jang Geun-won.

786
01:00:47,162 --> 01:00:48,914
I didn't know he was released.

787
01:00:49,247 --> 01:00:50,540
I was off guard.

788
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:56,671
So?

789
01:00:58,256 --> 01:00:59,633
Did something happen?

790
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:04,846
He doesn't even remember me.

791
01:01:06,264 --> 01:01:08,391
I've never forgotten him
even for an instant.

792
01:01:10,143 --> 01:01:11,770
Do you know what's funny?

793
01:01:12,062 --> 01:01:15,690
I'm different from back then,
and Jang Geun-won lost his everything.

794
01:01:19,277 --> 01:01:20,737
But I'm still afraid of him.

795
01:01:39,214 --> 01:01:41,841
I talked to Director Kang Min-jung.
We will have a new plan.

796
01:01:42,425 --> 01:01:44,678
I bet Jang Geun-soo will be the successor.

797
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:47,472
Successor?

798
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:50,350
Chairman Jang

799
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:54,688
has only a few months to live.

800
01:01:57,023 --> 01:01:59,526
Was it pancreatic cancer? Late-stage.

801
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,570
He's being punished by Heaven.

802
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:07,492
What?

803
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:27,304
JANGGA RICE SOUP

804
01:02:27,387 --> 01:02:28,430
Sang-sun.

805
01:02:29,472 --> 01:02:30,890
Have a bite.

806
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:32,225
It's good.

807
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:35,020
I'm hungry,

808
01:02:35,603 --> 01:02:37,439
but I don't want to eat.

809
01:02:38,023 --> 01:02:39,482
You should eat though.

810
01:02:39,983 --> 01:02:43,194
You said you want to be a doctor
when you grow up.

811
01:02:43,778 --> 01:02:46,406
So you should eat this and become healthy.

812
01:02:46,781 --> 01:02:47,782
Open your mouth.

813
01:02:49,909 --> 01:02:52,495
All right. Good girl.

814
01:02:55,623 --> 01:02:57,584
-What about you?
-What?

815
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:02,797
What do you want to be when you grow up?

816
01:03:04,299 --> 01:03:05,925
I want to

817
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:12,223
own a ten-story building.

818
01:03:12,807 --> 01:03:14,392
-A ten-story building?
-Yes.

819
01:03:16,436 --> 01:03:17,687
That's really tall.

820
01:03:17,771 --> 01:03:19,022
I know. It's tall.

821
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:23,234
You fool. There's no such thing
as a ten-story building.

822
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:24,861
Of course, there is.

823
01:03:24,944 --> 01:03:26,237
There isn't?

824
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:30,825
Gosh. Hey, if there's none,
I should build one.

825
01:03:31,493 --> 01:03:33,661
If you're nice to me,
I'll let you live in the building.

826
01:03:33,745 --> 01:03:35,997
That's not going to happen.

827
01:03:36,998 --> 01:03:38,917
You're not supposed to lie to her.

828
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:40,877
<i>Bo-hyeon.</i>

829
01:03:41,378 --> 01:03:43,838
See? I told you.

830
01:03:51,137 --> 01:03:52,555
I begged for food,

831
01:03:55,058 --> 01:03:56,768
lowered my head,

832
01:03:57,352 --> 01:03:59,437
and betrayed people.

833
01:04:03,691 --> 01:04:05,318
I abandoned,

834
01:04:06,903 --> 01:04:10,198
extorted, and trampled.

835
01:04:14,202 --> 01:04:16,579
With all my life,

836
01:04:18,206 --> 01:04:19,457
I've built

837
01:04:21,251 --> 01:04:23,211
this Jangga Co.

838
01:04:29,509 --> 01:04:31,177
I achieved it.

839
01:04:32,887 --> 01:04:33,847
I did.

840
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,916
Hello?

841
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,711
Who is this?

842
01:05:05,962 --> 01:05:07,130
<i>It's me.</i>

843
01:05:11,092 --> 01:05:12,177
<i>Park Saeroyi.</i>

844
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:15,722
Have you been doing well?

845
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:19,976
What do you want?

846
01:05:22,187 --> 01:05:23,396
I heard about you.

847
01:05:25,106 --> 01:05:26,566
You have cancer.

848
01:05:32,614 --> 01:05:33,907
Are you going to die?

849
01:05:37,118 --> 01:05:38,119
Are you trying to--

850
01:05:38,203 --> 01:05:39,370
I don't

851
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:47,754
want you to leave so easily like that.

852
01:05:54,928 --> 01:05:56,012
Punished by Heaven?

853
01:06:00,475 --> 01:06:01,684
Who said you can do that?

854
01:06:06,439 --> 01:06:08,399
You should be punished by me.

855
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:21,913
Don't die just yet.

856
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:36,052
<i>I can't believe you are the only person</i>

857
01:06:39,222 --> 01:06:40,682
<i>who wants me to stay alive.</i>

858
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,185
This is interesting.

859
01:06:46,104 --> 01:06:47,313
Fine.

860
01:06:50,358 --> 01:06:52,986
You will be my last grand show.

861
01:06:58,575 --> 01:07:00,368
I will see you soon.

862
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:09,168
I can't wait too long.

863
01:07:11,296 --> 01:07:12,880
Hurry and come.

864
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:30,106

Why do I have to feel sorry for you?

869
01:07:59,218 --> 01:08:02,221
I guess you are starting

<i>I know you better than anyone.</i>

871
