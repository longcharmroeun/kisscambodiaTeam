What do you usually think about
before you sleep?

00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:26,788
It's going to sound a little weird.

EPISODE 1

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,208
You might think I'm crazy.

9
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:36,631
I hope the world

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,635
comes to an end.

11
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:43,638
Are you going through something bad?

12
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:48,560
Well, not really.

13
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:52,146
Shall I say life feels like such a chore?

14
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:56,401
I actually sound crazy.

15
00:00:57,193 --> 00:01:00,405
You probably think it's ridiculous
that such a young girl is saying this.

16
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:03,074
Everyone feels that way about life
from time to time.

17
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:06,244
When do you feel that way the most?

18
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,916
I always feel that way.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,085
Life is repetitive, you know.

20
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:15,587
And it's predictable.

21
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,673
You study hard
to get into a good university.

22
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:22,760
Then when you're older, you must work hard
to meet a nice guy and get married.

23
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:26,347
All the efforts that you have to make...

24
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:32,979
Frankly, everyone knows
how to become successful.

25
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:35,023
"How to become successful"?

26
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:38,192
-How do you do it?
-You just need to

27
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:41,487
work hard, like crazy.

28
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:44,574
But it feels like such a chore.

29
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:49,245
Is there anything that gives you joy?
Something you like, for example.

30
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:52,040
I've actually told my boss

31
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:54,876
what I just told you.

32
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:57,545
Oh, your boss who you always talk about.

33
00:01:57,629 --> 00:01:59,213
What did your boss say?

34
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:01,382
<i>If it feels that much like a chore,</i>

35
00:02:05,678 --> 00:02:06,638
just die.

36
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,693
That made me realize
that I'm acting like a moody teenager.

37
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:23,946
Your boss sounds a little irresponsible.

38
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:27,659
That's what you thought
when he told you to just die?

39
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:30,078
Well...

40
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:32,497
That's how counseling should be done.

41
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,290
Sorry?

42
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:38,294
An open, candid conversation over a drink.

43
00:02:38,586 --> 00:02:39,671
You're leaving already?

44
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:41,464
I have to work.

45
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:44,217
You work so hard. I'll come by sometime.

46
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:46,886
Yes, you have to.
I'll give you lots of freebies.

Hey, hold it up. Hold it properly!

63
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,278
I'll smack you guys
for each drop that spills.

64
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:48,406
You guys always skip
the after-school study hours!

65
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:50,908

You guys don't have such freedom!

69
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:58,833
You'd all better step up your game.

70
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,419
Our class GPA is the lowest!

71
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:02,503
What?

72
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:06,174
You can't focus because of these punks?
Let these guys teach you a lesson.

73
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:08,426
Do you know what will happen to them?

74
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:11,512
They'll just mooch off their parents
like leeches.

75
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:13,389
They'll become useless scumbags, okay?

76
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:18,519
<i>This boy says that he sometimes hears
a bleep inside his head.</i>

77
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,109
Gosh!

78
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,528
What the heck?

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,285
Hey, is this your way
of rebelling against me?

80
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,371
-What a lunatic.
-I'm sorry.

81
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:38,748
-What's he doing?
-What?

82
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,461
-Shall I go fill it up again?
-What?

83
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:48,341
What are you looking at? You punks.

84
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:51,177
Hey, you'd better watch out.

85
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:53,054
Gosh, this nutjob...

86
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,139
<i>He got scolded every single day</i>

87
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:57,725
<i>but never attended
any of the after-school study hours.</i>

88
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:01,562
<i>He acted like a lunatic from time to time,</i>

89
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:03,481
<i>but he was a disciplined student.</i>

90
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:06,025
<i>He never had a friend
throughout high school.</i>

91
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:09,070
<i>But for some strange reason,
he never seemed lonely.</i>

92
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,743
What are you doing? Go.

93
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:24,210
<i>Without even realizing it,
I had developed a crush on him.</i>

94
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:27,421
Hey, I'm hungry.

95
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:31,968
"The boy is transferring to another school
next week.

96
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:34,595
I'm sad.

97
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:38,850
Shall I tell him how I feel or not?
I'm torn."

98
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:42,728
It was a cute story from a girl
who has a crush on her classmate.

99
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:46,190
<i>I'm not sure
what would be the right choice to make,</i>

100
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,819
<i>but your inner compass usually tells you
what it is that you want to do.</i>

101
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,783
<i>Just like the way you think about the boy,</i>

102
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:59,245
<i>try to focus on what your heart wants.</i>

103
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:07,295
She'll give it to him now.

104
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:11,382
She's had a crush on him for three years.
Will her love come true today?

105
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:12,675
Let's see!

106
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:16,470
Sae-ro-yi.

107
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:20,558
I heard you're transferring
to another school.

108
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,019
Yes.

109
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:35,990
The exam for the Police University
is tomorrow, right?

110
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:39,577
Good luck.

111
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:45,208
TO SAE-RO-YI

112
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,174
Let's go.

113
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,972
What happened? Why did he just walk away?

114
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:01,807
Why didn't he take the chocolate?

115
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:06,729
He doesn't like sweets.

116
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:08,606
LEE JIN-HUI, CHOI GA-YEONG

117
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,651
I've always known it,
but he's actually crazy.

118
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:14,695
I know. I mean, can't he just accept it?
He's leaving anyway.

119
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,531
He always does whatever the hell he wants.

120
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:19,909
That's why

121
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:21,744
I fell for him.

122
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,169

Hey.

125
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:07,748
Wait.

126
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,543
Spare some change, please?

127
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:13,421
Gosh!

128
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:15,798
Are you all right?

129
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:18,217
I'll help you up.

130
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,388
Excuse me.

131
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:23,306
Hey!

132
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:26,684
Wait.

133
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,063
You're nuts. Walking away
after pushing someone like that.

134
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:33,524
He grabbed me, so I shook him off.

135
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:36,652
Go apologize to him.

136
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:38,112
He could've gotten hurt.

137
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:40,614
OH SOO-AH

138
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:43,534
Are you proud to do a good deed?

139
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,453
What?

140
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,788
Does it make you feel like
you're a good person?

141
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:50,750
So annoying.

142
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:01,344
-Seventeen.
-One.

144
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:15,900
What?

145
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,486
Isn't he the guy who got
a perfect score on the strength training?

146
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:20,404
He can't really run though.

147
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:23,366
Yes, I see that.
It looks like he has an injury.

148
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:27,161
Do you know this?

149
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:28,829
Do you?

150
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,456
Know what?

151
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:33,584
You won't pass if you get one point
in anything in the physical evaluation.

152
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,878
You hurt your leg, didn't you?

153
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:39,840
It doesn't look like either of us
will pass, so why don't you take it easy?

154
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:42,593
I'll be fine.

155
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:46,555
Hey, wait! Jeez!

156
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:50,267
Look at him.

157
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:53,437
Gosh, he's fierce.

158
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:08,536
Mr. Park, congratulations
on transferring to the HQ.

159
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:11,038
My gosh, Ms. Kang.

160
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,959
-It's been a while.
-Gosh, you're at it again.

161
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,461
You're hurting my feelings here.

162
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:19,463
Just treat me like you used to.

163
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,715
All right. It's good to see you.

164
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:25,386
I heard you're transferring to Pajin City.
Did the move go well?

165
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,888
I haven't moved yet.
I'll do it on the weekend.

166
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:29,598
What about Sae-ro-yi?

167
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:32,017
He'll transfer to Gwangjin High.

168
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,563
Gwangjin High? Geun-won goes there, too.

169
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:38,649
-The chairman's son?
-Yes.

170
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,569
-What year is Sae-ro-yi in?
-He's a senior.

171
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:44,822
-Then they're the same age.
-Really?

172
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:48,617
That little boy is already
a high school senior?

173
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:52,830
He's actually taking the physical test
for the National Police University today.

174
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:55,040
Even I'm nervous.

175
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,963
You know, the orphanage.
The one that the company sponsors.

176
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:02,673
Gaenari Orphanage? What about it?

177
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,175
I'm in charge of it.

178
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:08,053
We've decided
to pull sponsorship altogether.

179
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:10,598
What do you mean?

180
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,767
Jangga is the only company
that provides them with meals.

181
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,520
Who's going to feed the kids
if we pull sponsorship?

182
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:19,523
Remember the documentary
about the elderly that aired recently?

183
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:21,525
Nursing homes are the thing now.

184
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,444
Are we just after media attention?

185
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:25,446
I told you. Business is all about people.

186
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:30,284
Who is it?
Who made such a foolish decision?

187
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:33,454
The chairman.

188
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,294
But what he's thinking is obvious,
you know.

189
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:50,804
Shall I rebel against him
if it bothers you that much?

190
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:52,514
Forget it, Ms. Kang.

191
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:54,475
We have no choice.

192
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:56,560
It's unnecessary to get on his wrong side.

193
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,438
Like you said, it's a business after all.

194
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,331
TEST IDENTIFICATION SLIP
PARK SAE-RO-YI

195
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:19,625
SIT-UP, PUSH-UP, 1,000M SPRINT,
STANDING LONG JUMP

196
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,255
Is your leg okay?

197
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:27,258
I passed the physical test, you know.
It's totally fine.

198
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:30,552
Aren't you sad about leaving your friends?

199
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:32,680
No, it's okay. I don't have any friends.

200
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:37,476
Right, I heard the chairman's son
goes to the school you're transferring to.

201
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,727
He's the same age as you.

202
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:41,772
I hope you guys are in the same class.

203
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:43,691
What's his name?

204
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,734
Jang Geun-won.

205
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,989
-Do I have to get along with him?
-If you guys click.

206
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:54,660
He's the chairman's son.
I guess I have to get along with him.

207
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:59,164
Goodness.
As if you care about things like that.

208
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,250
Try to get along with your classmates.

209
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,753
Reading over your school records
hurt my feelings a little.

210
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,259
Because it says that I'm "socially inept"?

211
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:11,427
That's right.

212
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:14,555
Even to me,
you seem a little socially awkward.

213
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:17,558
Don't be so hardheaded.

214
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,768
It'll only make your life more difficult.

215
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:23,439
What? You said our family motto is,
"Never compromise your principles."

216
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:25,232
What do you want me to do?

217
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:28,152
I'm not sure.

218
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:34,575
By the way, where are we going?

219
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:38,120
PAJIN GAENARI ORPHANAGE

220
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,377
I'll give you yummy snacks.

221
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,756
-Here.
-Thank you.

222
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,424
-You should share it.
-Thank you.

223
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,010
This is so random.

224
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,803
Why bring me
to an orphanage out of the blue?

225
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:56,764
Why not?

226
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:59,892
You said we were going
to finish packing up our stuff.

227
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,727
Come on, seriously.

228
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,979
We can pack anytime.

229
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,731
Hey, go hang those.

230
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:07,775
-Okay.
-Mr. Park!

231
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:10,486
Mr. Park.

232
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:14,615
Hi, Soo-ah.
You're getting prettier by the day.

233
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,536
What?

234
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:22,164
Mr. Park, is he your son?

235
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:23,248
Yes.

236
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:25,668
He is. Say hi.

237
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,127
I'll go hang clean laundry.

238
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,338
Her name is... What's with him?

239
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:49,400
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:54,571
I heard from the director.

241
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:56,782
It's not your fault though.

242
00:14:57,491 --> 00:14:59,118
You have to listen to your boss.

243
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:02,371
But now that I live close by,

244
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:04,623
I'll visit often to cook for you.

245
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:06,208
Really?

246
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:11,088
I was worried about not being able to eat
your food again, not the sponsorship.

247
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:14,049
Thank you.

248
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,551
You don't need to thank me.

249
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,303
I'm grateful
you've grown into a good girl.

250
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,520
By the way,
your son is very different from you.

251
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:31,024
He's kind of cold and shy, isn't he?

252
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,778
I'm not talking about that.
He's pretty good-looking.

253
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,031
Really? I think he got that from me.

254
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:51,628
Hey.

255
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:55,466
So you're transferring to Gwangjin High?

256
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:57,593
I go to Gwangjin High, too.

257
00:15:58,469 --> 00:15:59,470
Which class?

258
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,063
I'm trying to befriend you here.
Can't you cooperate?

259
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:11,774
Why do you want to befriend me?

260
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:13,942
Because you're Mr. Park's son.

261
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,738
-Are you and my dad close?
-Yes.

262
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:19,948
Has it been about five years?

263
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,867
He works at Jangga Co., you know?

264
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,204
The company sponsors our orphanage,
and he's in charge of it.

265
00:16:32,753 --> 00:16:33,962
Why is this still so wet?

266
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,799
Gosh, you really are socially inept.

267
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:41,136
Is it because of that incident?

268
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:43,138
You were so annoying.

269
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,768
Is it annoying to help those
in need of help?

270
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,813
How is it different
from my dad helping you?

271
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:56,610
Right, I take back what I said.

272
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:58,904
I guess we can't be friends.

273
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,287
Hey, you brought this.

274
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:09,581
You like doing good deeds.

275
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,042
Hang them all by yourself.

276
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,210
That little...

277
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:23,136
Take good care of yourself.

278
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:25,305
-You, too.
-Will do.

279
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:27,891
Hey!

280
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,143
Hey! Come out and say bye.

281
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:36,608
Try to understand. He's not that social.

282
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,110
I can see that.

283
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,570
Maybe you coddled him too much.

284
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:43,949
Bye. Drive safely.

285
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:46,451
Call me if anything happens.
I'll be off, then.

286
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:14,897
Food is ready.

287
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:18,233
This looks so good.

288
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,444
Thanks, son.

289
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:22,362
Enjoy.

290
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:26,241
Hey, this is your first day
at your new school.

291
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:28,827
I'm worried because you haven't bought
your new uniform yet.

292
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:32,998
Shall I make some time in the morning
and pick it up?

293
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:35,292
No, it's your first day at the HQ.

294
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,085
I'll just wear this today.

295
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,213
-Sure, if you're okay with that.
-Yes.

296
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:48,805
Your cooking skills are getting better
by the day. This is delicious.

297
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:50,766
I guess I got that from you.

298
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:57,314
You need to season this again.
It's not edible.

299
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:00,901
I made it bland on purpose.

300
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,611
It's too bland.

301
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:14,414
BUS STOP

302
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:32,057
-Geun-won.
-Get in. I'll give you a ride.

303
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:34,059
The bus will be here shortly.

304
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,395
Why take the bus?
Enjoy the comfortable ride.

305
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:38,855
I'll be uncomfortable.

306
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:44,987
Let's go.

307
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:24,693
GWANGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

308
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:30,574
Be quiet.

309
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:35,495
Attention, everyone.

310
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:37,247
We have a new student.

311
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,916
You won't have time to make friends
since you're seniors.

312
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,626
But don't be mean to him.

313
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,712
And make sure you get along
until you graduate, okay?

314
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:45,297
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

315
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,174
You should introduce yourself.

316
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,509
Oh, okay.

317
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:58,393
Hello, my name is Park Sae-ro-yi.
Nice to meet you.

318
00:20:58,477 --> 00:20:59,644
-Gosh.
-Come on.

319
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:03,148
Tell us what you want to become
and what your hobby is.

320
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:04,941
Oh, right.

321
00:21:09,154 --> 00:21:10,322
I want to become

322
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:12,115
a police officer.

323
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:15,994
And I enjoy listening to music

324
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:18,955
and running.

325
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:21,458
Okay, I guess that's it.
Give him a round of applause.

326
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:25,337
You can sit...

327
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:27,964
There's an empty seat.

328
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,636
You can sit there.

329
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:36,723
You guys can study while I go
to the teachers' room. Don't chat.

330
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,350
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

331
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,468
Come on, you loser.

332
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:18,139
Are you crazy? My gosh, seriously.

333
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,226
-My gosh.
-I'm sorry.

334
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,355
Don't you know that I hate white milk?

335
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,566
Tell me.

336
00:22:30,193 --> 00:22:32,529
The snack bar was out of strawberry milk.
I'm sorry.

337
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:37,826
My gosh, you little loser.
Let me look at you.

338
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:40,537
Hey.

339
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:43,707
If the snack bar was
out of strawberry milk,

340
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:46,501
you could've gone outside
and bought one at the supermarket.

341
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:48,169
Hey, look.

342
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:49,963
Look at me.

343
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:53,633
Look at how handsome you look.
Let me take a photo.

344
00:22:53,884 --> 00:22:54,968
-Forget it.
-Stand straight.

345
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,095
What are you going to do?

346
00:22:59,097 --> 00:23:01,433
-It's making me feel uncomfortable.
-Smile.

347
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:03,435
You should know when not to interfere.

348
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:06,438
Don't you know who he is?
He's Jang Geun-won.

349
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:08,940
He's your dad's boss' son.

350
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:10,734
My gosh, turn left.

351
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:13,278
Don't you know which way is left
and which way is right?

352
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:15,530
One, two, three.

353
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:16,990
-So?
-Say, "cheese."

354
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,367
What do you mean?

355
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:21,703
He's the successor of Jangga Co.
He's the chairman's son.

356
00:23:22,454 --> 00:23:25,081
If you get on his bad side,
it won't do your dad any good.

357
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:26,666
Let me take a photo.

358
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:28,752
That's your reason?

359
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:31,671
What?

360
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:34,966
-Will you smile already?
-Hey.

361
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:38,094
Open your eyes, you punk. Open...

362
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,680
That's enough.

363
00:23:45,268 --> 00:23:46,394
Just because you're rich

364
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,563
doesn't mean you can be an asshole.

365
00:23:57,614 --> 00:23:58,657
"Asshole"?

366
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:05,080
He must be crazy.

367
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:08,041
My gosh.

368
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:11,002
He's a real hero, isn't he?

369
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:13,421
Don't you agree?

370
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:14,881
Hey.

371
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:19,594
Yes?

372
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:21,972
What?

373
00:24:28,395 --> 00:24:31,606
You look like you have a temper.
You must be a pretty good fighter.

374
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:33,984
-Am I correct?
-Stop it.

375
00:24:37,904 --> 00:24:39,489
Do you want to know the school rule?

376
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,206
-What's going on?
-My gosh.

377
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:50,250
The homeroom teacher's here.

378
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:52,669
Hey, loser.

379
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,464
Let's carry on a bit later.

380
00:24:57,882 --> 00:24:59,592
LEE HO-JIN

381
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:03,263
Sir, don't you see this?

382
00:25:04,597 --> 00:25:05,765
What? Well...

383
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:10,061
That's enough messing around.
Get ready for class.

384
00:25:10,145 --> 00:25:11,479
Yes, sir.

385
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:20,739
Do what the teacher says.

386
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,407
Do you get it now?

387
00:25:26,745 --> 00:25:27,871
The school rule.

388
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:31,332
Jang Geun-won

389
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,917
is the law around here.

390
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:58,026
You're crazy.

391
00:25:58,651 --> 00:25:59,652
Geun-won!

392
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:01,321
Geun-won.

393
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,585
Most of the stew made by Jangga Co.
are seasoned

394
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:18,379
with this special sauce.
Why don't you have a taste?

395
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,551
How does it taste?

396
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:26,638
The spiciness is just the right amount,
and it's very savory. Don't you agree?

397
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,433
-Yes, it's delicious.
-It's very savory.

398
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,021
This sauce played a great role
in the development of our company.

399
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:38,983
The chairman came up
with the recipe himself.

400
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:41,486
-He came up with it himself?
-Impressive, right?

401
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:43,905
I really like the color.

402
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:47,283
My goodness. Long time no see, Mr. Kim.

403
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:49,994
You need to come outside for a bit.

404
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:52,163
What?

405
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:57,127
My gosh. This is what you do
on your first day of school?

406
00:26:58,294 --> 00:26:59,462
How dare you beat up a friend

407
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:02,465
in front of a teacher?

408
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:05,343
Are you a gangster?

409
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:10,473
Geun-won, are you okay?

410
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:13,434
Do I look okay to you?

411
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:17,313
-He broke my nose.
-I'm really sorry about what happened.

412
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:20,400
I shouldn't have accepted that punk.

413
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:38,251
-Sir, you're here.
-Dad.

414
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,213
I'm sorry about all this.

415
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:44,632
Get up, you punk.

416
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,327
Mr. Park.

417
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:15,079
I heard he's your son.

418
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,124
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

419
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:20,627
What?

420
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:22,754
He's your son?

421
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:26,257
My dad's employee's son
had the guts to hit me?

422
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:28,092
Behave yourself in front of the adults.

423
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:31,387
I'm...

424
00:28:31,638 --> 00:28:32,514
I'm sorry.

425
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,934
I'm sorry about that.
My son was very rude.

426
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,270
No, it's okay, sir.

427
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,110
Your name is Sae-ro-yi?

428
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,075
-Principal.
-Yes, sir?

429
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,620
What's going to happen to him?

430
00:28:56,287 --> 00:29:00,208
We'll follow the school rules
and have him expelled.

431
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:04,796
And the police will help you
come to a settlement.

432
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:07,340
The police doesn't need
to get involved in this.

433
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:09,467
Mr. Park and I

434
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,513
have known each other for a long time,
so settling things won't be an issue.

435
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:18,560
But

436
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:22,313
school rules are different.

437
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:26,150
What do you say?

438
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:28,069
Pardon?

439
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:29,487
Will he be able to stay in school

440
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,574
if we decide to forgive him?

441
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:37,954
Yes, of course. If you forgive him,

442
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:41,958
we'll give him a good scolding
and make sure this never happens again.

443
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:44,836
Okay.

444
00:29:45,712 --> 00:29:47,463
Let's not cause a fuss.

445
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:51,968
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

446
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,722
That's enough.
You're an important member of the company.

447
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:57,849
Thank you, sir.

448
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:01,060
I'll make sure this never happens again.

449
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,318
But...

450
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:11,821
Sae-ro-yi.

451
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:17,827
It's important that you know
how to apologize for your mistakes.

452
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:22,874
I want you to kneel before my son
and apologize for what you did.

453
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:25,710
That's how we'll settle this.

454
00:30:31,924 --> 00:30:34,010
But sir, that's...

455
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,303
Mr. Park.

456
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:38,723
My eldest son got beaten up.

457
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:42,226
It makes me feel very uneasy
to be in this situation.

458
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:46,022
So I'm offering a solution
that will enable me to tolerate this.

459
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:48,733
We need to wrap this up anyway.

460
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:54,197
What do you think,

461
00:30:55,073 --> 00:30:56,115
Sae-ro-yi?

462
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:11,923
If you do something wrong,

463
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,551
it's only right that you get punished.

464
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:18,221
That's what my dad taught me.

465
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:21,140
That's right.

466
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,811
Mr. Park, you're a great father.
You taught him well.

467
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:29,691
But my dad

468
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:32,735
also taught me

469
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:36,155
that one must stick to their beliefs.

470
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:45,957
I saw one of my classmates get bullied.

471
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,127
And the teacher condoned that.

472
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:51,879
I never bullied anyone, you jerk.

473
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:54,090
It made me feel uneasy,
so I tried to stop him.

474
00:31:58,594 --> 00:32:00,513
But he didn't listen, so I hit him.

475
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:07,395
It was wrong of him to bully a classmate
in front of a teacher.

476
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:15,361
I deserve to get punished
for what I did wrong.

477
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:17,071
Sae-ro-yi...

478
00:32:17,822 --> 00:32:18,781
But...

479
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,327
I can't apologize to Geun-won.

480
00:32:27,331 --> 00:32:28,374
Because

481
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:31,085
I don't feel sorry at all.

482
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,928
So you refuse to get on your knees

483
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,057
-even if you could get expelled?
-I'm doing what I think is right.

484
00:32:46,726 --> 00:32:48,311
That's what my dad taught me.

485
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:53,232
And I wish to continue living like that.

486
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:08,915
How unfortunate.

487
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:15,797
You leave me with no choice.

488
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:21,177
Mr. Park, what do you think?

489
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:24,555
Why are you so quiet?

490
00:33:29,143 --> 00:33:33,314
He's still just a child
who doesn't know the ways of the world.

491
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:38,110
It's hard to believe that he's my son.

492
00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:48,830
I'm amazed by him.

493
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:02,385
He's doing what he thinks is right

494
00:34:03,094 --> 00:34:04,554
and is willing to be responsible.

495
00:34:06,764 --> 00:34:07,807
So...

496
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:11,227
So I have

497
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:15,147
nothing more to say to you, sir.

498
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:22,446
You're being a fool.

499
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:25,783
How are you going to keep
working at the company

500
00:34:26,993 --> 00:34:29,036
now that things are awkward between us?

501
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:30,830
Wait. This is my--

502
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,790
I'll resign, sir.

503
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:34,667
Dad.

504
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:47,305
Okay then.

505
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:49,515
You do that.

506
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:54,478
Thank you so much

507
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,565
for everything, sir.

508
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:20,671
Enjoy.

509
00:35:24,842 --> 00:35:26,385
Whatever the reason,

510
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:29,013
violence can never be justified.

511
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,266
You did something you shouldn't have done,

512
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:34,560
and you got punished for that.

513
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:38,147
What about you, Dad?

514
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:43,861
You did nothing wrong,
so why are you resigning?

515
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:48,240
Just like your beliefs,

516
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:52,453
I also have my own beliefs as a father.

517
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,375
Can you drink?

518
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:02,505
I'm a student. I shouldn't drink.

519
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:04,966
You're not a student anymore.

520
00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:15,309
Pour me a glass.

521
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:22,274
Hold the bottle with your right hand,
and make sure you cover the label.

522
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:24,443
Lightly support it with your left hand.

523
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:25,987
Good.

524
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,493
Don't fill up the entire glass.
Just a little more than half.

525
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:34,286
Okay, that's good.

526
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:38,374
Okay then. Let's have a drink.

527
00:36:43,212 --> 00:36:46,007
Turn your head slightly to the side
when you drink.

528
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:48,592
Yes, that's right.

529
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:58,436
How does it taste?

530
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,233
It's sweet.

531
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:07,111
My goodness.

532
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:12,491
That means you had
a very impressive day today.

533
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:30,426
I know I'm not a student anymore.

534
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:33,387
But I'm still a minor.
Are you allowed to teach me this?

535
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:36,432
Dads are supposed to teach their sons
how to drink.

536
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:45,191
It's sweet for me too.

537
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:11,175
I'm really sorry.

538
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,892
This will all just be a memory
once time passes by.

539
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,603
You can take the GED

540
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:24,980
to replace your diploma.

541
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:27,358
And I have enough money

542
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:30,986
to start a small restaurant of my own.

543
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:36,033
But that's not what's important.

544
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:41,080
I know I always told you
to stick to your beliefs.

545
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,125
But I failed to do that myself.

546
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:49,421
Unlike myself,

547
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:52,216
I wanted you to be proud and confident.

548
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,513
And today, I could see

549
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:02,726
you were already living like that.

550
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:10,860
You have no idea how proud I was.

551
00:39:16,198 --> 00:39:19,034
I want you to keep
living like that, my son.

552
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:08,125
-Hey, look!
-What is it?

553
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:12,796
Geun-won got a car
after he got his driver's license.

554
00:40:13,464 --> 00:40:14,757
I can't believe he drove it here.

555
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:16,926
But I bet the teacher won't scold him.

556
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:25,100
2006 GWANGJIN UNIVERSITY
ROLLING ADMISSION FOR FRESHMAN STUDENTS

557
00:40:25,184 --> 00:40:28,062
The rolling admission exam
for Gwangjin University is next week.

558
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,190
Did you study hard?

559
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,859
Yes, I guess.

560
00:40:41,659 --> 00:40:45,204
ANNOUNCEMENT

561
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:46,497
Aren't you coming?

562
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:48,666
Right. Let's go.

563
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,422
PARK SAE-RO-YI, CLASS 3-1, EXPELLED

564
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:03,514
Isn't it beautiful?

565
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,269
Yes, it's pretty.

566
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:11,981
You have good taste.
This is a limited edition.

567
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:15,526
The license plate is also amazing.
It's 7777.

568
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:19,571
It's really hard to get this number,
but the dealer helped me get it.

569
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,617
-That's great.
-Are you on your way home?

570
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,119
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

571
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:26,662
Maybe next time.

572
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:28,497
What's with the cold shoulder?

573
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:36,630
Is something bothering you?

574
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:38,841
You think?

575
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:40,634
Oh, right.

576
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:44,138
I heard my dad's company stopped
sponsoring the orphanage.

577
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,098
Don't worry about it.

578
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,100
I'll ask my dad to change his mind.

579
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,521
That's not what this is about.

580
00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:54,565
The kids won't starve because of that.

581
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:12,166
That will be 3,000 won.
Do you have a discount or point card?

582
00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:13,208
No.

583
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:16,670
Thank you. Goodbye.

584
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:22,801
Mr. Park.

585
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,888
What do you plan to do?

586
00:42:26,472 --> 00:42:28,307
What? What do you mean?

587
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:30,726
I heard you got fired.

588
00:42:30,893 --> 00:42:33,645
I didn't get fired. I quit.

589
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,231
What's the difference?

590
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:38,692
My gosh, stop worrying

591
00:42:38,776 --> 00:42:40,736
and just focus on
getting into a university.

592
00:42:41,653 --> 00:42:43,322
By the way, did you pay for my tuition?

593
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:45,741
-What?
-The orphanage director told me

594
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,659
that you paid for my tuition.

595
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:50,496
You're starting to nag again.

596
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,081
Let me eat.

597
00:42:52,164 --> 00:42:55,334
My gosh, I finally get
where he got that nosiness from.

598
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:57,044
What? Who are you talking about?

599
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:59,588
Who do you think?
I'm talking about your son.

600
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:01,465
He's just like you.

601
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:03,717
Why are you in such a bad mood today?

602
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:05,094
Did something bad happen?

603
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:08,931
Yes, you got fired.

604
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:11,350
You and your son are unbelievable.

605
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,894
I'm never going to live like you guys.

606
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,355
You call yourself a cook,

607
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:18,941
but you're eating instant noodles.

608
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:23,862
Well, I do hope you end up
living a better life.

609
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:27,950
I haven't even taken
my rolling admission exam yet.

610
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:29,201
What if I flunk the exam?

611
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:32,955
You're a smart girl.

612
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,457
If you fail this year,
you'll get in next year.

613
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,501
Says the guy who got fired.

614
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:39,294
How are you going to make a living?

615
00:43:42,214 --> 00:43:44,716
You have no idea how proud I am.

616
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:49,304
That wild little girl grew up to be
such a magnificent person.

617
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:55,602
You should go to university.

618
00:43:56,562 --> 00:43:57,771
You can succeed

619
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:00,232
and pay me back twofold.

620
00:44:06,238 --> 00:44:07,322
Then...

621
00:44:08,407 --> 00:44:09,908
Then let's say I borrowed that money.

622
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:14,454
I'll succeed and pay you back
three times the amount.

623
00:44:14,538 --> 00:44:16,540
Okay, deal.

624
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:20,460
Do you have any leftover <i>gimbaps</i>?

625
00:44:20,544 --> 00:44:23,964
Do you have any that passed
the expiry date?

626
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:26,758
What about ones that expired yesterday?

627
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:35,267
<i>I heard what happened to Mr. Park.</i>

628
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:39,188
Yes, he was your mentor, wasn't he?

629
00:44:40,689 --> 00:44:42,482
I know you guys were very close.

630
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:47,029
Yes, he was also very close
with my late father.

631
00:44:47,738 --> 00:44:52,451
And from what I know,
he was very close with you, too.

632
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,288
That doesn't matter
when it comes to running a company.

633
00:44:56,371 --> 00:45:00,542
You of all people know
that Mr. Park is very smart and competent.

634
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:02,377
He played a very big role in...

635
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:16,391
He disobeyed me.

636
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,896
He was a very loyal dog.

637
00:45:21,563 --> 00:45:24,066
But what do you think happens
when an old and useless dog

638
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:26,902
fails to recognize its owner?

639
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:28,904
Sir.

640
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:33,283
Personally speaking,

641
00:45:34,326 --> 00:45:36,828
I'm a very authoritative person.

642
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,121
Do you know why?

643
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:43,001
Your father and I started out
with a small pub

644
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:45,295
and was able to build Jangga Co.
after so much hard work.

645
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,507
And all the decisions I made
throughout that journey

646
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:51,885
were correct.

647
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,603
I think of you like my own daughter.

648
00:46:02,646 --> 00:46:04,606
But please don't provoke me too much.

649
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:25,794
Just a second, sir.

650
00:46:26,837 --> 00:46:29,131
-Where's my wallet?
-It's okay. Just get in.

651
00:46:31,717 --> 00:46:32,759
My test ID.

652
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:46,857
Hey.

653
00:46:47,482 --> 00:46:48,483
Hey!

654
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:52,946
I thought today was your interview

655
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:54,489
for the rolling admission.

656
00:46:55,282 --> 00:46:56,491
Where are you going?

657
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,577
You already know where.

658
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:00,912
Why aren't you taking the bus?

659
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,416
I forgot to bring my test ID and ID card.

660
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:05,834
I'm so stupid.

661
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:07,044
What are you going to do?

662
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,296
Will you stop asking me?

663
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:11,465
I told you that I messed up.

664
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,302
But why are you running
instead of taking a bus?

665
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,765
I'll be late for the interview
if I wait for the next bus.

666
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,936
It's fine. I just need to get
to Gwangjin University in 20 minutes.

667
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,355
Twenty minutes?

668
00:47:27,064 --> 00:47:29,983
That's at least 3km away from here.

669
00:47:31,234 --> 00:47:32,361
Mind your own business.

670
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:36,990
Wait.

671
00:47:38,533 --> 00:47:40,410
You won't be able to make it at this pace.

672
00:47:40,911 --> 00:47:42,037
Just mind your own business.

673
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,330
Try to keep up with me.

674
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:44,748
Can you do that?

675
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:46,750
I can do it.

676
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:37,509
Hang in there. We're almost there.

677
00:48:39,553 --> 00:48:41,054
Why are you helping me?

678
00:48:41,513 --> 00:48:43,598
I thought you hated me.

679
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:47,018
Don't be absurd.

680
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:48,603
Now, breathe. Slowly.

681
00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:52,023
Come on.

682
00:49:08,582 --> 00:49:10,917
I told you I can make it on my own.

683
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:11,960
Okay, whatever.

684
00:49:15,046 --> 00:49:16,173
We're almost there.

685
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,238
Soo-ah.

686
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:46,161
Good luck on your interview.

687
00:49:47,954 --> 00:49:49,664
Gosh, you don't need to worry.

688
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,458
I'll do well.

689
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:01,843
LIST OF APPLICANTS

690
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:05,722
Numbers 21 to 25, please come inside.

691
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:18,443
<i>Soo-ah.</i>

692
00:50:19,528 --> 00:50:21,988
Good luck on your interview.

693
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:30,205
GWANGJIN UNIVERSITY

694
00:50:48,557 --> 00:50:49,849
What are you doing here?

695
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:52,978
Were you waiting for me?

696
00:50:56,398 --> 00:50:57,399
Well...

697
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,860
How was the interview? Did you do well?

698
00:51:02,654 --> 00:51:03,655
Yes, thanks to you.

699
00:51:05,448 --> 00:51:06,825
Why did you wait?

700
00:51:16,668 --> 00:51:17,961
Do you still

701
00:51:19,504 --> 00:51:21,089
want to be friends because of my dad?

702
00:51:21,172 --> 00:51:22,549
Because I do.

703
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:30,807
Can't we be friends?

704
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:35,437
We can be friends.

705
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:51,077
Why do you want to be friends with me?

706
00:51:52,162 --> 00:51:53,496
You don't like me.

707
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,542
No reason.

708
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,130
I used to think you were a girl
with no heart.

709
00:52:03,298 --> 00:52:05,383
But I think I might know
why you were being like that.

710
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:10,764
Why do you think I'm like this?

711
00:52:10,972 --> 00:52:12,098
Because you're twisted.

712
00:52:14,351 --> 00:52:16,019
Are you sure you want to be my friend?

713
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:20,440
You don't like to receive help, do you?

714
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:23,151
And you don't like people asking for help.

715
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,196
"I'm nothing like as bad as the person.

716
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:27,989
There are people going through worse.

717
00:52:28,073 --> 00:52:30,283
I should rather be grateful."

718
00:52:31,993 --> 00:52:33,995
Do you know what a sympathy is?

719
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:37,040
It's a distasteful emotion
where you look down on someone

720
00:52:37,332 --> 00:52:39,084
and get comfort from it.

721
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:47,967
What about my dad?

722
00:52:48,843 --> 00:52:50,804
Was it also a sympathy
that's just distasteful?

723
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:54,974
He's different.

724
00:52:56,685 --> 00:52:57,644
How is he different?

725
00:52:58,645 --> 00:52:59,813
You don't have to know.

726
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:17,038
By the way, the fact that
you hit Jang Geun-won the other day.

727
00:53:17,372 --> 00:53:18,456
Do you not regret it?

728
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:21,042
What?

729
00:53:23,753 --> 00:53:25,588
Even when Geun-won did something wrong,

730
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:27,382
no one could stop him.

731
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:29,759
Even teachers were no different.

732
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,097
But you made a huge scene as soon
as you transferred from another school.

733
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:39,269
That was cool.

734
00:53:43,106 --> 00:53:46,109
But you ended up
getting expelled from school.

735
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:50,238
I can't live like you or your dad.

736
00:53:50,947 --> 00:53:52,490
And that's not what I want.

737
00:53:57,162 --> 00:53:58,663
Why did you have to bring that up?

738
00:53:58,747 --> 00:53:59,622
No reason.

739
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,166
I'm just saying.

740
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,711
It's getting cold. Let's go.

741
00:54:07,338 --> 00:54:08,298
Wait.

742
00:54:12,552 --> 00:54:15,680
What was that? Do you have a cell phone?

743
00:54:16,806 --> 00:54:18,308
What's going on?

744
00:54:19,976 --> 00:54:21,936
I told you. I want to be your friend.

745
00:54:26,107 --> 00:54:28,193
Give me your phone.
I'll give you my number.

746
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:38,578
I'm doing this because we're friends.

747
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:41,956
You shouldn't have a crush on me.

748
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:43,541
What?

749
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:44,751
Here. This is my number.

750
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:52,926
So this is it.

751
00:54:53,218 --> 00:54:54,552
Why can't I have a crush on you?

752
00:54:57,138 --> 00:55:00,016
A stubborn guy like you
gives a girl a hard time.

753
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:03,978
Okay?

754
00:55:04,062 --> 00:55:06,981
You shouldn't fall for me.

755
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:12,278
Why aren't you answering me?

756
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:16,533
We never know...

757
00:55:19,202 --> 00:55:20,870
what will happen in life.

758
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:22,789
Give me. I can't do this.

759
00:55:22,872 --> 00:55:24,916
You can't take it back from me.

760
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:26,626
I'll get going. I'll call you.

761
00:55:26,709 --> 00:55:28,753
-Hey, Sae-ro-yi.
-Oh, right.

762
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:32,006
You...

763
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:39,597
You're cool enough.

764
00:55:44,561 --> 00:55:45,770
And you're very pretty.

765
00:55:49,899 --> 00:55:51,192
I should get going. See you.

766
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,571
Hey! Delete my number!

767
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:18,803
You seem to be in a good mood.

768
00:56:18,887 --> 00:56:21,222
What? Of course I am.

769
00:56:21,306 --> 00:56:24,684
I've always dreamed
of running my own business.

770
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:27,729
My heart is pounding with anticipation.

771
00:56:31,065 --> 00:56:33,318
By the way, what's the name of the pub?

772
00:56:33,902 --> 00:56:34,903
Well...

773
00:56:35,987 --> 00:56:37,989
What about Saeroyi Pub?

774
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:40,617
I don't like it. It sounds silly.

775
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,079
We still have some time
until we open the place.

776
00:56:45,163 --> 00:56:48,708
You should come up with a decent name.

777
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:57,342
<i>I got expelled from school.</i>

778
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:02,222
<i>My dad got fired.</i>

779
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,060
<i>It was no big deal.</i>

780
00:57:10,355 --> 00:57:11,814
<i>There was no change in my daily life.</i>

781
00:57:14,234 --> 00:57:15,485
-I did it.
-It worked.

782
00:57:15,568 --> 00:57:16,611
-I really did it.
-Right.

783
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,572
<i>Having many different feelings,</i>

784
00:57:21,532 --> 00:57:23,159
<i>I just live from day to day.</i>

785
00:57:25,995 --> 00:57:27,121
Hey, come here.

786
00:57:29,582 --> 00:57:32,710
Go ahead and do it now.

787
00:57:33,586 --> 00:57:34,796
All right. Let's drink.

788
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:35,838
<i>I'm still young,</i>

789
00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:37,090
You guys should drink water.

790
00:57:37,173 --> 00:57:39,467
<i>but I think this is life.</i>

791
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,302
Bottoms up!

792
00:57:41,928 --> 00:57:43,846
<i>I have these silly thoughts</i>

793
00:57:44,555 --> 00:57:46,266
<i>that my dad might laugh at.</i>

794
00:57:46,683 --> 00:57:47,976
How does the water taste?

795
00:57:48,351 --> 00:57:49,352
It's great.

796
00:58:09,455 --> 00:58:12,792
Sure. I bought everything we need.

797
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:15,670
Yes. I bought meat, too.

798
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,964
The color looks amazing.

799
00:58:18,548 --> 00:58:20,133
I'll be right there.

800
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:22,427
Okay, son.

801
00:58:59,505 --> 00:59:00,882
<i>As long as we're alive,</i>

802
00:59:03,593 --> 00:59:05,345
<i>nothing is a big deal.</i>

803
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,141
<i>As long as we are alive.</i>

804
00:59:21,235 --> 00:59:23,237
I have to survive.

805
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:32,997
My son...

806
01:00:08,908 --> 01:00:09,909
<i>That night,</i>

807
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:13,246
<i>Dad didn't come back.</i>

808
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:46,070
I'm sorry.

809
01:01:15,641 --> 01:01:16,934
What are you thinking about?

810
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:24,108
You got expelled

811
01:01:25,401 --> 01:01:27,361
on the first day in the new school.

812
01:01:32,074 --> 01:01:33,576
I don't have to buy the uniform.

813
01:01:34,577 --> 01:01:35,578
The uniform.

814
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,725
You might end up passing out.

815
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:01,187
You should force yourself to eat.

816
01:02:08,528 --> 01:02:09,862
It's strange,

817
01:02:12,782 --> 01:02:14,784
but all I can remember is
what I've gotten.

818
01:02:19,997 --> 01:02:21,958
I just took it for granted.

819
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:28,381
Why did I take it for granted?

820
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:32,718
I must've been crazy.

821
01:02:42,144 --> 01:02:43,604
Mr. Park Sae-ro-yi.

822
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,404
I'm sorry to bother you
at a time like this.

823
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:54,907
I'm Detective Oh Byung-heon
in charge of your father's case.

824
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:56,951
The suspect

825
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,287
turned himself in this morning.

826
01:03:02,123 --> 01:03:05,876
I think you should know
the circumstances of the case.

827
01:03:07,628 --> 01:03:09,338
These are the photos of the scene.

828
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:12,133
The suspect wants to reach a settlement.

829
01:03:14,802 --> 01:03:15,845
A settlement?

830
01:03:15,928 --> 01:03:17,805
In a case like this...

831
01:03:17,888 --> 01:03:19,015
So you mean

832
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:23,269
he wants

833
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,314
to measure the value

834
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:29,900
of my dad's life?

835
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:36,574
So this guy

836
01:03:38,618 --> 01:03:40,620
wants to pay me for that?

837
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:44,749
I'm sorry for your loss, but...

838
01:03:49,378 --> 01:03:51,464
Sae-ro-yi, are you all right?

839
01:03:56,344 --> 01:04:01,474
Sir, he hasn't slept or eaten
for the past two days.

840
01:04:02,308 --> 01:04:06,103
Do you mind visiting him sometime later?

841
01:04:07,271 --> 01:04:09,857
I'm really sorry for what happened.

842
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,860
Please get some rest and give us a call.

843
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:15,780
Let's go.

844
01:04:26,582 --> 01:04:27,750
You should get some rest.

845
01:04:29,085 --> 01:04:32,505
Otherwise, you might collapse soon.

846
01:04:34,465 --> 01:04:35,758
I'm sorry.

847
01:04:47,186 --> 01:04:48,062
What...

848
01:04:48,646 --> 01:04:50,272
This...

849
01:04:51,816 --> 01:04:53,401
Why is it here?

850
01:04:58,239 --> 01:04:59,448
This car.

851
01:05:01,659 --> 01:05:04,161
-Why?
-Why is it here?

852
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:08,332
You have good taste.
This is a limited edition.

853
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:11,627
The license plate is also amazing.
It's 7777.

854
01:05:11,711 --> 01:05:14,255
It's really hard to get this number.

855
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:20,261
This is Jang Geun-won's car.

856
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:26,392
Are you sure?

857
01:05:35,943 --> 01:05:37,653
Are you sure it's Jang Geun-won's car?

858
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:43,659
Yes.

859
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:45,870
He said it's a limited edition.

860
01:05:46,328 --> 01:05:49,039
And I'm sure this is his number.

861
01:06:02,178 --> 01:06:03,179
Sae-ro-yi.

862
01:06:04,096 --> 01:06:05,765
I'm sorry. Will you
excuse me for a second?

863
01:06:08,768 --> 01:06:09,769
Sae-ro-yi.

864
01:06:10,519 --> 01:06:11,520
Sae-ro-yi!

865
01:06:14,899 --> 01:06:17,318
Sae-ro-yi, wait.

866
01:06:18,068 --> 01:06:19,528
What are you going to do?

867
01:06:21,113 --> 01:06:23,240
Let's calm down
and call the police first...

868
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:54,897
What is he doing here?

869
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,482
He's Sae-ro-yi.

870
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,986
-What's going on?
-Why is he here?

871
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:05,991
<i>Family.</i>

872
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:09,745
<i>Dad.</i>

873
01:07:11,121 --> 01:07:14,124
<i>Even before I realized his favor
that I can't return,</i>

874
01:07:17,169 --> 01:07:18,629
<i>I lost the one.</i>

875
01:07:18,712 --> 01:07:19,797
GWANGJIN HOSPITAL

876
01:07:29,473 --> 01:07:32,643
<i>The one was like my everything.</i>

877
01:07:35,187 --> 01:07:37,815
<i>It broke my heart
because he only cared about me.</i>

878
01:07:39,567 --> 01:07:41,485
<i>And that's why I could try hard.</i>

879
01:07:44,697 --> 01:07:46,323
<i>To me, you were</i>

880
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:49,952
<i>the reason for my existence, Dad.</i>

881
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:35,122
<i>Sae-ro-yi.</i>

882
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:39,960
It's important that you know
how to apologize for your mistakes.

883
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,006
<i>That's what I heard.</i>

884
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:49,178
<i>But he took my everything.</i>

885
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:52,473
What are you doing?

886
01:08:54,642 --> 01:08:56,060
How did you...

887
01:08:58,103 --> 01:09:00,356
Now that you seem startled,
it's just obvious.

888
01:09:00,856 --> 01:09:03,692
Wait. Hang on a second.

889
01:09:07,905 --> 01:09:09,281
It's you, right?

890
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,203
Wait.

891
01:09:15,037 --> 01:09:17,831
Let's talk it out. Calm down.

892
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:21,627
Why did you not call the hospital?

893
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,003
No.

894
01:09:23,087 --> 01:09:25,255
It's not like that. Let's talk it out.
Let this go.

895
01:09:29,927 --> 01:09:32,054
Why is someone else being punished?

896
01:09:32,137 --> 01:09:33,889
Help!

897
01:09:35,933 --> 01:09:37,267
Help me!

898
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:45,234
Hang on. Wait and just listen to me.

899
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:48,529
You jerk.

900
01:09:50,447 --> 01:09:52,074
Why did you kill my dad?

901
01:09:55,869 --> 01:09:57,621
Why?

902
01:10:02,418 --> 01:10:03,794
I'm sorry.

903
01:10:03,961 --> 01:10:06,130
I'm really sorry.

904
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:18,976
Please stop. I'm so sorry.

905
01:10:24,023 --> 01:10:25,190
It's too late.

906
01:10:29,737 --> 01:10:31,238
The one who should receive the apology

907
01:10:32,823 --> 01:10:34,241
is dead.

908
01:10:37,494 --> 01:10:40,622
Wait. Please don't do this.

909
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:43,751
You killed him.

910
01:10:45,335 --> 01:10:46,587
You have to

911
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,630
go apologize to him.

912
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:53,719
You have to die!

913
01:10:54,845 --> 01:10:56,055
Die!

914
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,432
Go ahead and die!

915
01:10:58,515 --> 01:11:02,936
Die! Die, you jerk!

916
01:11:03,854 --> 01:11:05,230
Damn it.

917
01:11:06,565 --> 01:11:08,859
You son of a bitch.

918
01:11:42,768 --> 01:11:44,937
Die, you jerk!

919
01:11:49,572 --> 01:11:55,552
