00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:07,906
ITAEWON CLASS

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,393
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:13,978
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,111
Saeroyi.

5
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,212
You

6
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:44,091
brought me to my knees.

7
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:01,317
Why are you being like this?

8
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:05,154
Your beliefs and ambition.
Where did they all go?

9
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:11,994
This was enough
to bring you to your knees?

10
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:19,293
After all, you're surrendering
because I have more power.

11
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,635
Where is Jang Geun-won?

12
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:38,521
I thought this would be my last chance
to enjoy some entertainment.

13
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,568
How disappointing.

14
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:49,782
You're truly pathetic.

15
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,455
But because you got down
on those pathetic knees of yours,

16
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,128
I have no choice
but to desert my son once again.

17
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,709
You're kneeling before me, your enemy.

18
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:44,128
Tell me.

19
00:02:45,838 --> 00:02:47,131
How does it feel?

20
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:54,972
I feel pathetic.

21
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:57,850
You do?

22
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:03,981
-You may leave.
-How do you feel now, sir?

23
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:11,906
You brought me to my knees.

24
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:14,116
Are you happy?

25
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:25,711
Is this gratifying for you?

26
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,673
-Are you--
-Wanting

27
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:33,594
to get back at you
kept me going until now.

28
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,768
Jang Dae-hee, the chairman of Jangga Co.

29
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:42,978
My enemy.

30
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:47,525
You made my life hell.
But at the same time,

31
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:50,528
you were an inspiring man.

32
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:57,493
I had to admit that
despite our different values.

33
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:00,496
I devoted

34
00:04:03,457 --> 00:04:05,334
my whole life

35
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,836
to follow in your footsteps.

36
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:13,592
I thought

37
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:18,138
this fight was worth it.

38
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:21,684
-Hold on.
-But that man

39
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:24,687
threatened me

40
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,315
to kneel before him
by holding my close ones hostage.

41
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:35,739
I wasted over a decade of my life
following in the footsteps

42
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:37,157
of such a disgusting old grouch?

43
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:42,580
I deeply regret

44
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:47,710
wasting my life.

45
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:52,673
But look at the outcome.

46
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:55,426
You got down on your knees before me.

47
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:57,928
Sometimes, to get what you want--

48
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:02,600
Let's go, Seung-kwon.

49
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,310
Okay.

50
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,710
After over a decade,

51
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,129
I got to know you.

52
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:53,567
THE FINAL EPISODE

53
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:54,777
All right.

54
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:57,279
Forget about Park Saeroyi.

55
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,574
I want you to die, Jo Yi-seo.

56
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:24,056
Don't waste your energy and stay still.

57
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:28,769
Pick it up.

58
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,073
Gosh, I'm terrified.

59
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:42,032
Why?

60
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,160
Do you want to fight against us?

61
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,205
You guys are funny.

62
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,667
Attack them as I count to three.

63
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:55,170
Come on.

64
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,380
One.

65
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,716
Two, three.

66
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:01,927
Good luck, Jang Geun-soo! Hang in there!

67
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:11,937
What are you doing? Catch him.

68
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:13,897
Damn it!

69
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:15,899
Don't you dare come close to me.

70
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:22,406
What are you doing?

71
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,033
She told me

72
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:27,911
to hang on.

73
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:45,971
You know it will be dangerous.

74
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:50,684
I will

75
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,562
save Yi-seo.

76
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:57,107
I know. That's why we're going there.

77
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,028
You should also choose your priority.

78
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,614
What?

79
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:05,616
Things will go haywire

80
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,993
if you fail to make a decision.

81
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:10,162
Even if

82
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,624
we both get hurt

83
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,586
or die, my priority is to save Yi-seo.

84
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,673
Is that so?

85
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:26,094
But I can't force you to do the same.

86
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:30,933
My gosh, then why did you
ask me to come with you?

87
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:35,354
Yi-seo

88
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,065
may be a rude brat.

89
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,859
But she's family now.

90
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:43,403
I also care about her.

91
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,864
We should work toward the same goal

92
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:48,367
for better teamwork.

93
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:52,955
Thank you.

94
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:54,540
No problem.

95
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,627
By the way,
I'm going to save Yi-seo even if you die.

96
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:22,442
Are you okay?

97
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,529
I bet you've never been stabbed before.

98
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:30,909
It's useless to act brave
like those guys you see in movies.

99
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:32,703
This is the reality.

100
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:44,089
You really are tough.

101
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,133
Hold on tight.

102
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,766
That's enough.

103
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,437
What about Yi-seo?

104
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,314
You'll lose her.

105
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:05,652
You're right.

106
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:09,323
Start the car.

107
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:25,297
You got everything you want
including Jangga Co.

108
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:27,883
Just stay out of this.

109
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:33,263
Everything I want?

110
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,854
Throughout my entire life, I never got

111
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,149
what I wanted.

112
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:52,115
But I have to say,

113
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,870
I guess we really are brothers.

114
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,042
What?

115
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,003
We always used

116
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:08,465
the wrong method.

117
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:16,056
What is he doing? Aren't you coming?

118
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,644
Keep him here.

119
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:57,681
Hey!

120
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,766
Give up already!

121
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:01,852
You can't run away!

122
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:05,063
You give up, you fucking loser!

123
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,819
-Go get her.
-Yes, sir.

124
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,536
My gosh.

125
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:21,872
She's unbelievable.

126
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:54,529
My gosh.

127
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:14,091
Run into it.

128
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,212
The airbags work nicely.

129
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:53,630
This car is amazing.

130
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:57,676
My gosh.

131
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,761
Gosh, what is all this?

132
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:01,888
My gosh.

133
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:07,060
Boss?

134
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:10,981
Yi-seo.

135
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:16,111
Boss...

136
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:18,405
Boss!

137
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:35,589
Are you okay?

138
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,259
I heard you got hurt.

139
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:44,639
What in the world are you doing here?
Have you lost your mind?

140
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:47,684
Saeroyi!

141
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,568
You saved me some time.

142
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,572
You came here to die, right?

143
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:03,783
Saeroyi.

144
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:07,412
Hee-hoon.

145
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,498
You should've stayed at the hospital.

146
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:14,920
I called the cops before I came here.

147
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:19,591
Can you please just leave?

148
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:22,177
You fucking coward.

149
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,428
Gosh, it hurts.

150
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:27,432
You asshole.

151
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:30,936
Seung-kwon, are you okay?

152
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:35,482
Ms. Jo, it's nice to hear you
call me by my name.

153
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:37,692
Seung-kwon.

154
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:40,070
Yes, I know my priorities.

155
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:46,952
Hurry up and get out of here.
I'll take care of this.

156
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:52,582
Let's go.

157
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,129
That darn little...

158
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,343
Choi Seung-kwon.

159
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:15,021
Finish him.

160
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:26,074
My gosh, you used to be one of us.

161
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,076
But you're ruthless.

162
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:30,620
"Don't hesitate."

163
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,331
That's what you always used to say.

164
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,418
I have to say,

165
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,671
-you're better off with us.
-No.

166
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,384
I'm better at serving tables.

167
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,126
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

168
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:20,545
Why did you come here?

169
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,130
Come here.

170
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:28,345
This reminds me of that day

171
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:30,805
when we both ran like crazy in Itaewon.

172
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:34,142
Why are you suddenly talking about that?

173
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,937
I missed you so much.

174
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:51,076
You always

175
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:54,704
worked so hard for me.

176
00:17:56,664 --> 00:17:58,083
And you always got hurt.

177
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:03,088
What's going on?

178
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:06,925
Are you sure you're okay?

179
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:12,889
I can't believe this.

180
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:22,607
My mind

181
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:27,028
and heart

182
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,162
are both filled with you.

183
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:46,214
Is this how you felt?

184
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:47,924
This is very

185
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:50,009
heart beating.

186
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:53,847
Boss.

187
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,889
I love you.

188
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:02,564
I love you, Yi-seo.

189
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,072
I love you so much.

190
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:35,638
Those crazy psychos.

191
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,373
Go. Run.

192
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:04,584
I can't leave without you.

193
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,377
Are you trying to die alone?

194
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:10,632
The cops will call you.

195
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:13,051
Answer the phone
and tell them where we are.

196
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,142
You guys are having fun, aren't you?

197
00:20:23,228 --> 00:20:24,938
Trust me and just go.

198
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,066
Yi-seo.

199
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,071
What a fucking joke.

200
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:35,156
If you die,

201
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:37,408
I'll die too.

202
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:39,911
Go on. Hurry.

203
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:42,497
Hey!

204
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:54,467
Damn it.

205
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:01,307
You want to die, right?

206
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,644
Both Seung-kwon and I
put our lives on the line.

207
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:09,274
Your life means nothing to me.

208
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:12,151
Crazy bastard.

209
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:19,784
Boss!

210
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,119
You fucking asshole!

211
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,958
What now, you bastard?

212
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:45,184
<i>Today,</i>

213
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:49,439
<i>it all ends.</i>

214
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:01,576
You fucking bastard.

215
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:07,790
Die!

216
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,252
Die just like your father!

217
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:20,053
How can you still call yourself human?

218
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,279
Yi-seo, Geun-soo, Ho-jin,

219
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,323
and my dad.

220
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:45,411
Do you feel no guilt at all?

221
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:50,416
Do you feel guilty

222
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,377
when you eat livestock?

223
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:54,295
What?

224
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:56,506
Because of you livestock,

225
00:22:58,132 --> 00:22:59,217
I lost everything.

226
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:01,177
"Guilt"?

227
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,221
Cut the bullshit.

228
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:06,224
-You fucking asshole!
-Shut up, you jerk!

229
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:17,985
Die, you piece of shit!

230
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:19,946
Die! Just die already!

231
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:20,988
Stop. Wait.

232
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:26,119
I can't beat you.

233
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:28,162
I lost.

234
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,544
Saeroyi offered me a way out,

235
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:36,629
so let me just leave quietly.

236
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:45,179
What about your guys?

237
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:48,349
What about them?

238
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:50,768
Look at me.

239
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:53,354
I can't even take care of myself.

240
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,482
I'll leave them here for now--

241
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:57,525
Stop.

242
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,405
Stop talking.

243
00:24:07,368 --> 00:24:09,787
You're starting to make me regret

244
00:24:11,456 --> 00:24:13,207
having worked for you.

245
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:18,379
A true boss

246
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,549
is someone who takes responsibility.

247
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:29,015
Die!

248
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,767
Go to hell!

249
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:06,427
Wait. Over there. Please pull over.

250
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:47,632
Just die, you zombie.

251
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:55,390
I'm no longer the man I used to be.

252
00:25:59,352 --> 00:26:00,687
<i>Just remember one thing.</i>

253
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,815
<i>If you die,</i>

254
00:26:04,816 --> 00:26:05,984
<i>I'll die too.</i>

255
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:10,738
I can't let it happen.

256
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:13,491
I can feel it.

257
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:16,786
What crap are you talking about?

258
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:20,206
I think

259
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,251
I will be happy.

260
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:26,796
That's not going to happen.

261
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:33,511
Damn it!

262
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,308
Damn, what was that?

263
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:41,477
It's okay.

264
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:15,428
<i>I sometimes wonder</i>

265
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:18,222
<i>if there's really any point in living.</i>

266
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,601
Life is just so pointless

267
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:22,977
and obvious.

268
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,438
What are you talking about?

269
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:31,277
We all grow old and die one day
before we even turn 100.

270
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:35,198
But we all try so hard
to live a decent life.

271
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:40,244
It would've been nice
if was never born in the first place.

272
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:43,164
It feels like such a chore.

273
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,584
If it feels that much like a chore,

274
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:49,837
just die.

275
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:52,507
What?

276
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,050
I guess you're not that clever.

277
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:57,303
You talk as if you're some kind of a god.

278
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:03,559
Every night after work,
I go for a run in the neighborhood.

279
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:07,438
And when I wake up tomorrow,
I'll open the restaurant

280
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:10,358
and spend the day working there again.

281
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,237
Your life might seem repetitive.

282
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:18,991
But no one really knows
what could happen tomorrow.

283
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:24,038
Seung-kwon once tried
to start a fight with me,

284
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,582
but now he's a waiter at DanBam.

285
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:30,378
You made my pub get suspended,
but now you're the manager.

286
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:33,923
Not a single day was predictable for me.

287
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,054
Some days were tough,
and some days were sad.

288
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:45,810
But something fun always came along
every once in a while.

289
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,482
It's been happening a lot more often
ever since you came.

290
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:56,320
Every day is full of excitement.

291
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:03,244
Who knows?

292
00:29:03,786 --> 00:29:05,037
One day,

293
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:09,333
your boring life might
turn into an exciting one.

294
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:15,882
It's cold. Let's go.

295
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:19,969
Me too.

296
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:27,268
When I'm with you,

297
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,021
my heart beats

298
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,273
and it's fun.

299
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,077
I did it.

300
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,165
It's all done now.

301
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:11,646
Boss!

302
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,153
You are okay...

303
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:23,616
<i>Let's be</i>

304
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,043
<i>let's be happy.</i>

305
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:39,025
PROSECUTION

306
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:51,245
<i>The prosecution carried out
a thorough search of Jangga Co.</i>

307
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:53,414
<i>for bribery, embezzlement,
and slush fund creation.</i>

308
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:57,960
<i>Chairman Jang Dae-hee is forbidden
from leaving the country.</i>

309
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,380
<i>And he will be summoned
for investigation within this week.</i>

310
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:06,719
<i>Based on the seized data
from the offices of Jangga Co.,</i>

311
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,597
<i>the prosecution will focus
on grasping the size and flow</i>

312
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,475
<i>of the embezzlement and slush fund.</i>

313
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:57,895
<i>A connection with gangsters.</i>

314
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,189
Incitement to commit murder. Kidnapping.

315
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:04,151
Also, Ms. Oh blew the whistle

316
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:09,657
and disclosed the embezzlement,
bribery, and other irregularities.

317
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,785
There's going to be a search and seizure.

318
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:14,912
There's no way out of this.

319
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:19,625
I think

320
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:22,712
you'll also have to attend.

321
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,466
I'll take the blame for everything.

322
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,263
Anything else?

323
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:36,976
Mr. Kim.

324
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:42,857
The pub owners

325
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:48,028
wish to cancel the contract
and receive compensation.

326
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:49,363
The Olympics will be held soon.

327
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:53,659
We just need to wait until then--

328
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:55,536
The company is on the brink of bankruptcy.

329
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,459
And the board is considering the option
of selling the company.

330
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,044
What?

331
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,297
What are you talking about?

332
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,423
If we sell now,

333
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,512
we'll gain absolutely nothing.

334
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,431
Have they lost their minds?

335
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,602
There's one firm that offered to take over

336
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,480
at a pretty reasonable price.

337
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:31,697
CHUNGCHEONG PRISON

338
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:40,080
LET'S BUILD MORALITY
AND LIVE HEALTHY LIVES

339
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:47,922
You seem familiar.

340
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,216
I'm Lee Ho-jin.

341
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:52,968
"Lee Ho-jin"?

342
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:56,889
I'm a financial manager for IC Co.

343
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,016
Before that, I used to be

344
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,894
the financial manager
for Director Kang Min-jung.

345
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,896
And before that,

346
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:08,192
I was a Senior in class one
at Gwangjin Highschool.

347
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,736
You bullied me.

348
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:17,785
What...

349
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,204
That nerd?

350
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:22,873
How could you forget me?

351
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,252
The whole thing between Saeroyi and you
started with me.

352
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:28,879
You...

353
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:29,922
Did you...

354
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,966
And I get to wrap things up too.

355
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,718
What are you talking about?

356
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:38,764
There will be a takeover bid
for Jangga Co.

357
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,352
Takeover?

358
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:47,147
Those days you don't even remember...

359
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,192
"Jang Geun-won is the law."

360
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:54,113
You could say that
as Jangga Co. had your back.

361
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:58,033
I wanted to see you
without your background.

362
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,911
All the corruption of Chairman Jang
has been revealed.

363
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,371
He will soon be arrested.

364
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:06,083
How dare you...

365
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,179
Stop whining.

366
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,349
You...

367
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:23,475
It's done.

368
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,898
I forgive you.

369
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:33,903
Hey, Lee Ho-jin.

370
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,322
You moron.

371
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:38,115
Lee Ho-jin!

372
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,742
You idiot!

373
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:41,035
Damn it!

374
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:42,661
Hey!

375
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:45,456
Let go of me. Lee Ho-jin!

376
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:50,002
Min-jung.

377
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:52,922
Hey.

378
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,551
Where are you going?

379
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:58,677
Seoul.

380
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,679
I have something to take care of.

381
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,140
I'm going back to the head office.

382
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:06,060
I see. That's a bummer.

383
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,227
Right?

384
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,898
I won't

385
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,650
get to see you often then.

386
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:15,861
It depends on you.

387
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:18,238
You can visit me when you come to Seoul.

388
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:26,538
How could I do that?

389
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,209
You can't?

390
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,544
Then you won't get to see me.

391
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,464
You are so lame.

392
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,426
I'll see you later, Hye-won. Bye.

393
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,594
Bye!

394
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:43,806
Well...

395
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,599
Director Kang.

396
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:49,520
You're not my employee.
Why do you call me like that?

397
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:51,480
You can call me by my name.

398
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:53,482
Okay.

399
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:54,984
Ms. Min-jung.

400
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,360
My goodness.

401
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:01,365
What was that? It's funny, isn't it?

402
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,368
Can I

403
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:07,162
give you a ride?

404
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,289
She'll be a lot more
comfortable in that car.

405
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,582
Stay quiet.

406
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,793
The truck is too small for three people.

407
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:14,712
Well...

408
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,763
I will just squeeze in.

409
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:29,643
You go on ahead.
I'll be there in that truck.

410
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:31,061
Yes, ma'am.

411
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:33,647
Let's go.

412
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:34,565
Please get in.

413
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:50,247
JANGGA PUB, JANGGA NOODLES,
JANGGA RESTAURANT

414
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,707
A whistle blower.

415
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,335
No one would want to hire you.

416
00:38:57,463 --> 00:38:58,672
Why did you do that?

417
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:02,760
What about you?

418
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,929
Why do you try so hard

419
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,474
for Jangga Co. and Chairman Jang?

420
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:11,101
Do you not know why?

421
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:15,105
I'm

422
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,150
a salaryman.

423
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,991
I've learned a lot from you.

424
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:45,636
<i>There's no way</i>

425
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,055
that little brat can run Jangga Co.

426
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:51,517
Please help me this once.

427
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,144
Mr. Hwang.

428
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,484
What about the Mayor?

429
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:03,112
I can't reach him.

430
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:06,281
These old bats.

431
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:10,452
Only six months ago,
they were intimidated by me.

432
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:11,912
Damn it.

433
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:14,289
There is

434
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:16,917
nothing we can do now.

435
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:20,587
-Are you saying--
-Chairman Jang.

436
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:22,172
I mean,

437
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:25,634
Dad.

438
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,682
You know your favorite saying.

439
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,477
"The strong prey on the weak."

440
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:38,647
It's just like that.

441
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:41,358
We got weak,

442
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:44,570
so they are preying.

443
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:55,539
Get out.

444
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:22,524
That's ridiculous.

445
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:25,694
I'm Jang Dae-hee.

446
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,738
This is Jangga Co.

447
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:29,656
No.

448
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:31,783
It can never happen.

449
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,369
<i>Does this make sense to you?</i>

450
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,622
An ex-convict
who barely finished middle school?

451
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:38,457
I tried to put up with all that.

452
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,833
Mom, please.

453
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:43,420
And now what? Kidnap? She got kidnapped?

454
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:46,965
I'm really sorry.

455
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,343
I can't take this anymore.

456
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:52,804
I knew it all along when he stopped you
from going to college.

457
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:55,933
How would I trust you with my daughter
when you're like this?

458
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:01,396
I'm really sorry. I'll make sure
it will never happen again.

459
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,981
You have to.

460
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:06,109
I will watch you closely.

461
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,778
Make sure to take good care of her.

462
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,613
Sure. I will take...

463
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:14,785
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:21,208
Mom. We have to go. You should go.

465
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:23,877
Okay.

466
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:26,838
All right then. I hope you'll get better.

467
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:28,048
See you.

468
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:30,759
Thank you, Mother. Take care.

469
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:37,099
"Mother?"

470
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:41,520
Yes.

471
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:48,527
It's nice to hear.

472
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,404
Go, Mom.

473
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:52,447
Bye.

474
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,080
Wait, my legs.

475
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,460
I clearly heard you say
you'd take care of me.

476
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:06,628
What?

477
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,970
You know I'm not just a talker.

478
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:18,765
What?

479
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,187
Do you like me?

480
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,276
No, I love you.

481
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:38,535
Let's go.

482
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,873
What? I didn't hear you. Say that again.

483
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,082
Say what?

484
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,335
What you just said.

485
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:51,214
I love you. Let's go.

486
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:53,133
I love you too.

487
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,225
Didn't I tell you I'm upset with you?

488
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,143
I know.

489
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:07,647
I did get on your nerves

490
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:10,692
because of Park Saeroyi.

491
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,154
<i>Like you asked, I promise</i>

492
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:17,366
I won't mess with him again.

493
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,578
Let me get this straight.

494
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,539
It's not that you won't mess with him.

495
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:27,167
You just can't do it anymore.

496
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:32,714
We've known each other

497
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,633
for over 40 years.

498
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,176
Why did you call me?

499
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:39,971
I don't know if you're aware of it,

500
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:42,724
but I don't

501
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:45,310
have long to live.

502
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:55,612
I could build Jangga Co.
into a major company thanks to you.

503
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,823
I can't ruin it just like this.

504
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,950
If you give me one more chance--

505
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:01,743
<i>Is it because of me?</i>

506
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,538
You told me this before.

507
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:08,542
<i>You started your business
to feed your family.</i>

508
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:12,879
Do you still feel the same way?

509
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,340
Sure.

510
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:16,800
I really do.

511
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:18,343
Then let me ask you one thing.

512
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:21,138
If Park Saeroyi leads Jangga Co.,

513
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:23,723
will your family starve to death?

514
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:27,352
<i>Why do you</i>

515
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,646
run your business now?

516
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:38,613
I've never made you suffer a loss.

517
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:41,825
If you help me this once--

518
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:42,784
<i>For you,</i>

519
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,497
we've been together for mutual advantages.

520
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:50,876
It just goes away

521
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:53,253
once you lose your value.

522
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:58,049
Please don't be like this.

523
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:00,469
What should I do now?

524
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,762
<i>It can't be helped.</i>

525
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:05,807
You shouldn't be

526
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,726
clinging onto me.

527
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:10,437
-Ms. Kim.
-<i>There's someone else</i>

528
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:12,731
who can take care of things.

529
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:25,577
DANBAM

530
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,684
Welcome to Danbam.

531
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:04,908
Who is he? Why did Mr. Park come
all the way here to serve him food?

532
00:47:04,991 --> 00:47:07,077
I know. Ms. Jo is here too.

533
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:09,162
He looks familiar though.

534
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:48,034
Soft tofu stew?

535
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,954
Please try it.

536
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:55,477
I'm pursuing the takeover of Jangga Co.

537
00:49:04,694 --> 00:49:07,864
I'm planning to let
Director Kang run the company.

538
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:11,034
Since the company reputation is tarnished,

539
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:15,163
and I have hard feelings
toward the company name,

540
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:18,166
I'm going to change it.

541
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:28,134
This stew.

542
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:31,262
Where did you learn it from?

543
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:36,184
From my father.

544
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:39,312
Mr. Park?

545
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,904
I thought it tasted similar.

546
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,157
But this one has a unique aftertaste.

547
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,744
We have our own recipe for the sauce.

548
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:55,954
I give

549
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:59,666
a lot of care to fermented soybean powder.

550
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:01,543
A lot of care?

551
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,921
On a cold day,

552
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,091
the warmth spreads throughout the body.

553
00:50:08,925 --> 00:50:10,093
Isn't it good?

554
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:25,900
I agree.

555
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,496
I got treated with a nice meal like this.

556
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:40,957
But I'm sorry

557
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:44,419
I didn't bring any money.

558
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:52,552
This is embarrassing.

559
00:50:56,681 --> 00:50:58,516
Can I pay in another way?

560
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,476
What are you doing?

561
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:31,484
Jangga Co. is collapsing already.

562
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:34,696
There would be no advantage

563
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,448
in taking over the company.

564
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,245
This is all my fault.

565
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:46,624
This isn't just about resentment.

566
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:50,628
Jangga Co. is a good company.

567
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,805
I don't have many days to live.

568
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:04,142
I'm not doing this for my own good.

569
00:53:07,061 --> 00:53:08,062
I apologize

570
00:53:08,813 --> 00:53:09,939
with all my heart.

571
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,778
I've done terrible things

572
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:20,491
to Mr. Park and you.

573
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:22,744
I'm deeply sorry.

574
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,264
Please forgive me.

575
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:44,742
I've always wanted this to happen,

576
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:47,745
but it doesn't feel great.

577
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:05,179
I feel bad for Geun-soo.

578
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:08,599
Please get up.

579
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:17,942
Saeroyi.

580
00:55:27,952 --> 00:55:29,245
Do you think

581
00:55:36,335 --> 00:55:37,628
I'm a pushover?

582
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:42,675
What?

583
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:47,263
I'm

584
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:50,016
a businessman.

585
00:55:55,563 --> 00:55:56,898
This is about a business takeover.

586
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:58,775
You just apologized
after losing everything.

587
00:55:59,984 --> 00:56:01,652
What good would it do me?

588
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,041
Let's do business,

589
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:17,752
Chairman Jang.

590
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:24,402
The IC Co. will take over

591
00:57:24,485 --> 00:57:26,988
Jangga Co.

592
00:57:27,613 --> 00:57:29,866
Then, Mr. Park Saeroyi,
please say something for us.

593
00:57:36,622 --> 00:57:41,085
THE 32ND SHAREHOLDERS MEETING
OF JANGGA CO.

594
00:57:57,727 --> 00:58:00,980
Hello, I'm Park Saeroyi,
IC Co. representative.

595
00:58:03,566 --> 00:58:07,028
Jangga Co. is a restaurant company
representing Korea.

596
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:10,781
There is also a menu
that represents this Jangga Co.

597
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:15,328
<i>Gochujang</i> seasoned pork <i>bulgogi</i>
and its seasoning.

598
00:58:16,537 --> 00:58:19,999
The crisis in the country,
the days when everyone was in trouble,

599
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:23,878
It comforted the people
with its low price and delicious taste.

600
00:58:24,962 --> 00:58:28,591
The recent events
have cracked the corporate image,

601
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:31,052
but it's just an individual's fault.

602
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:34,764
Jangga Co. is still a good restaurant.

603
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:38,267
At that time,
it was not only money and gain

604
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:41,812
that Jangga Co. sought.

605
00:58:43,147 --> 00:58:44,815
The most important things in business.

606
00:58:45,691 --> 00:58:46,567
People.

607
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:48,277
Trust.

608
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,489
I will value people and not money.

609
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,951
I will value trust then gains.

610
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:58,329
With all of you,

611
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:00,456
we will renew

612
00:59:01,082 --> 00:59:02,959
and prosper again.

613
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:04,168
Thank you.

614
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:38,202
Congratulations on your wish fulfillment.

615
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:39,412
Thank you.

616
00:59:39,495 --> 00:59:40,663
Congratulations.

617
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:41,872
Congratulations.

618
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:45,835
Geun-soo.

619
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:57,013
I heard you resigned.

620
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:00,975
A defeated soldier must retreat.

621
01:00:03,227 --> 01:00:05,896
It might have been uncomfortable today
but you voted for me.

622
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:08,482
Why did you do that?

623
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:11,694
Is my vote meaningful?

624
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:14,196
I just...

625
01:00:15,614 --> 01:00:16,782
I wanted to see it.

626
01:00:19,785 --> 01:00:21,329
You achieved your goal.

627
01:00:24,332 --> 01:00:26,792
I will not harm you
for your father's deeds.

628
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:30,463
-One day with your abilities--
-It was me.

629
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:35,843
I told the reporters

630
01:00:38,971 --> 01:00:40,139
about Hyun-yi.

631
01:00:51,942 --> 01:00:52,860
In addition to that,

632
01:00:55,821 --> 01:00:57,490
I approached Seung-kwon

633
01:00:58,199 --> 01:00:59,909
to figure out the IC's movements.

634
01:01:03,788 --> 01:01:05,206
It wasn't the right clothes.

635
01:01:09,126 --> 01:01:10,419
I did everything I could

636
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,588
to win.

637
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:17,009
I knew from the beginning

638
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,180
that I wouldn't be able to get Yi-seo

639
01:01:23,015 --> 01:01:24,183
even if I took over Jangga Co.

640
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:31,399
I knew everything but I couldn't stop.

641
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:36,529
I didn't know how to stop..

642
01:01:45,788 --> 01:01:46,872
My heart...

643
01:01:47,832 --> 01:01:48,999
It's okay.

644
01:01:54,088 --> 01:01:55,297
Because you are just a kiddie.

645
01:01:58,926 --> 01:02:00,136
Come and eat from time to time.

646
01:02:24,452 --> 01:02:27,079
OH SOO-AH

647
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:30,749
Hello.

648
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:35,212
I heard. I wanted to congratulate you.

649
01:02:37,256 --> 01:02:38,549
A whistleblower.

650
01:02:39,842 --> 01:02:40,759
Why did you do that?

651
01:02:42,678 --> 01:02:43,804
It's not because of you.

652
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:46,765
What?

653
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,518
When I borrowed money

654
01:02:51,187 --> 01:02:52,897
for college from your dad,

655
01:02:54,398 --> 01:02:56,233
I told him I would pay him three times.

656
01:02:59,737 --> 01:03:00,779
<i>Is this</i>

657
01:03:02,573 --> 01:03:03,824
enough?

658
01:03:08,037 --> 01:03:08,913
Yes.

659
01:03:10,164 --> 01:03:11,081
Thank you.

660
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,298
Now I can comfortably

661
01:03:20,716 --> 01:03:22,176
live my life.

662
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:28,432
As a friend,

663
01:03:29,558 --> 01:03:30,559
can you cheer for me?

664
01:03:37,691 --> 01:03:38,776
I will always cheer for you.

665
01:03:48,953 --> 01:03:50,621
Now that your revenge is over,

666
01:03:52,498 --> 01:03:54,166
can I ask you a favor?

667
01:03:56,335 --> 01:03:57,253
What is it?

668
01:04:02,258 --> 01:04:03,467
Live

669
01:04:05,052 --> 01:04:05,970
happily.

670
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:14,270
I will.

671
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,774
DANBAM

672
01:05:05,988 --> 01:05:10,117
Do you want me to come with you?

673
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:14,455
What?

674
01:05:15,372 --> 01:05:16,832
What are you doing here?

675
01:05:16,915 --> 01:05:18,459
Geun-soo called me here.

676
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:19,627
-He called you too?
-Yes.

677
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:21,253
Hello.

678
01:05:22,671 --> 01:05:23,839
Why is he so depressed?

679
01:05:25,507 --> 01:05:27,343
He got dumped by his girlfriend.

680
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:31,013
Hey, it's no big deal.

681
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:33,140
Do you know how I feel?

682
01:05:33,223 --> 01:05:34,642
You don't even have a girlfriend.

683
01:05:36,894 --> 01:05:38,604
He's right. You don't.

684
01:05:41,565 --> 01:05:42,816
What is this?

685
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:44,109
Movie tickets?

686
01:05:46,236 --> 01:05:47,571
You can take it.

687
01:05:47,655 --> 01:05:49,281
I don't need it anymore.

688
01:05:49,365 --> 01:05:51,367
Gosh, Toni.

689
01:05:53,619 --> 01:05:54,828
What?

690
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:58,002
Oh...Hi.

691
01:06:02,464 --> 01:06:04,091
-Hi. Welcome.
-Hi.

692
01:06:04,174 --> 01:06:06,010
-Is it just the two of you?
-Yes.

693
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:07,686
Would you prefer a table with the view?

694
01:06:07,761 --> 01:06:08,887
Yes, please.

695
01:06:09,471 --> 01:06:10,764
Right this way.

696
01:06:13,055 --> 01:06:14,014
Hey.

697
01:06:14,348 --> 01:06:16,225
Did he just speak English?

698
01:06:16,308 --> 01:06:17,643
Yes, he learned it.

699
01:06:17,726 --> 01:06:19,561
That was his homework from our boss.

700
01:06:20,145 --> 01:06:21,939
What? It's Geun-soo.

701
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:35,160
Please forgive me.

702
01:06:38,872 --> 01:06:39,832
Raise your head.

703
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:52,052
You stabbed us in the back,
so we're paying it back.

704
01:06:55,764 --> 01:06:57,558
Did you hit him hard?

705
01:06:58,475 --> 01:06:59,810
Did I?

706
01:07:00,978 --> 01:07:01,854
Hey, are you...

707
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:09,194
I guess you didn't hit him right.

708
01:07:10,362 --> 01:07:11,613
Why did you do such a thing

709
01:07:11,697 --> 01:07:13,490
when you would feel bad about it?

710
01:07:15,784 --> 01:07:16,952
I'm sorry.

711
01:07:18,954 --> 01:07:21,749
Yi-seo is coming today.
Make sure to see her before you leave.

712
01:07:26,253 --> 01:07:27,129
Maybe next time.

713
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,548
I'll see her later.

714
01:07:29,631 --> 01:07:31,550
Why don't you stay here and see her?

715
01:07:33,802 --> 01:07:34,803
I'm

716
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:37,264
still a kiddie.

717
01:08:07,669 --> 01:08:08,754
What are you doing here?

718
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:10,839
Well...

719
01:08:13,675 --> 01:08:15,135
I'm going to the States.

720
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:20,599
I wanted to apologize
to Seung-kwon and Hyun-yi before I leave.

721
01:08:24,269 --> 01:08:27,356
Do you feel better this way?

722
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:31,485
Saying sorry won't just cut it.

723
01:08:36,114 --> 01:08:37,241
I know.

724
01:08:38,867 --> 01:08:39,785
Bye.

725
01:08:40,452 --> 01:08:41,620
Take care.

726
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,251
Yi-seo.

727
01:08:55,509 --> 01:08:56,760
What about

728
01:08:57,553 --> 01:08:58,428
a handshake?

729
01:09:02,057 --> 01:09:04,268
Is it something like an ending

730
01:09:05,227 --> 01:09:06,228
of your long crush?

731
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:08,897
Well...

732
01:09:12,192 --> 01:09:13,110
I know.

733
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,404
I don't deserve it.

734
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:23,662
Of course,

735
01:09:24,663 --> 01:09:25,622
you do.

736
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:31,670
You didn't even care
about right and wrong.

737
01:09:33,422 --> 01:09:34,715
You were just faithful to me.

738
01:09:36,466 --> 01:09:37,885
I couldn't accept it,

739
01:09:39,553 --> 01:09:40,846
but I could feel it all.

740
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,767
I'm sorry I took advantage of it.

741
01:09:48,312 --> 01:09:49,479
And thank you.

742
01:10:07,748 --> 01:10:08,749
Take care.

743
01:10:58,006 --> 01:10:59,508
-Is this it?
-Yes.

744
01:10:59,758 --> 01:11:02,594
This place is popular these days.
I'm here to spy on it.

745
01:11:04,972 --> 01:11:08,308
You don't have to spy on me.
Just ask me if you have questions.

746
01:11:10,394 --> 01:11:12,896
-The owner is pretty.
-Oh...

747
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,564
Is this yours?

748
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:18,527
I recently opened it
with Seok-cheon's investment.

749
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:20,862
Go ahead and spy.

750
01:11:20,946 --> 01:11:22,197
Come on in.

751
01:11:22,322 --> 01:11:23,240
I'll buy you some tea.

752
01:11:25,742 --> 01:11:26,702
You know what?

753
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:32,124
Boss and I are dating.

754
01:11:44,261 --> 01:11:45,429
I'm just relieved if it's you.

755
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:50,642
Take good care of Saeroyi.

756
01:11:54,312 --> 01:11:56,148
What? How nosy.

757
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:57,649
Why do you even care?

758
01:11:57,733 --> 01:11:59,776
-Let's just go, Hyun-yi.
-Hey.

759
01:12:04,114 --> 01:12:05,657
I'll come again next time.

760
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,909
Hey, wait for me...

761
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:13,999
I mean it.

762
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:17,169
Take good care of him.

763
01:12:20,505 --> 01:12:23,258
-That's so...
-Seok-cheon.

764
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,093
Soo-ah.

765
01:12:26,178 --> 01:12:27,763
A chef is here for an interview.

766
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:29,639
Oh, right. Where is he?

767
01:12:29,723 --> 01:12:30,891
He's there.

768
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:43,487
Hello.

769
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:53,163
Amazing.

770
01:12:54,623 --> 01:12:55,499
Sorry?

771
01:12:55,582 --> 01:12:56,666
You have to hire him.

772
01:12:57,793 --> 01:12:58,960
He's stunning.

773
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:02,422
Wow.

774
01:13:02,798 --> 01:13:04,424
How could a chef look like that?

775
01:13:04,508 --> 01:13:06,218
He should be serving in the hall.

776
01:13:06,718 --> 01:13:07,928
You'll hire him, right?

777
01:13:09,846 --> 01:13:11,515
I'll hire him only when he cooks well.

778
01:13:22,984 --> 01:13:26,029
Please say you like it.
You have to hire him.

779
01:13:31,243 --> 01:13:32,577
Do you like it?

780
01:13:41,169 --> 01:13:42,129
Can you

781
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:44,422
start tomorrow?

782
01:13:51,304 --> 01:13:53,140
Yes, Boss.

783
01:13:55,517 --> 01:13:57,269
I'll come here starting from tomorrow.

784
01:13:58,228 --> 01:14:00,564
I love it.

785
01:14:00,772 --> 01:14:01,898
It's delicious.

786
01:14:02,649 --> 01:14:04,609
Wow, this is amazing.

787
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,701
What was that?

788
01:14:13,994 --> 01:14:14,911
You startled me.

789
01:14:14,995 --> 01:14:17,205
Why did you call me? I'm busy.

790
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:19,040
No reason.

791
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:21,543
I got free tickets.

792
01:14:22,294 --> 01:14:23,753
But I didn't want to watch it alone.

793
01:14:25,213 --> 01:14:29,384
I guess Director Choi has
a lot of free time these days.

794
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:32,345
It's not like I can sell these tickets.

795
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:38,101
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

796
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:41,229
I'm coming.

797
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:42,731
Gosh.

798
01:14:46,443 --> 01:14:47,694
Gosh.

799
01:14:47,903 --> 01:14:48,820
Hello.

800
01:15:07,172 --> 01:15:09,132
YI-SEO AND SAEROYI

801
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:18,516
What are you doing here?

802
01:15:24,231 --> 01:15:25,190
Are you busy?

803
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,026
Why? Is something wrong?

804
01:15:32,906 --> 01:15:34,157
Not really.

805
01:15:34,699 --> 01:15:36,368
A cool breeze is blowing outside.

806
01:15:37,535 --> 01:15:39,246
It's a nice day for a walk.

807
01:15:39,955 --> 01:15:40,997
If you're not busy,

808
01:15:41,498 --> 01:15:42,332
can we go out?

809
01:15:46,628 --> 01:15:47,629
I'm not busy.

810
01:15:48,213 --> 01:15:51,508
MR. PARK'S SCHEDULE

811
01:15:52,717 --> 01:15:55,720
I haven't been to Itaewon with you
in such a long time.

812
01:15:55,804 --> 01:15:58,265
I know. We've been busy.

813
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:04,229
-Boss.
-Yes?

814
01:16:04,312 --> 01:16:05,522
Come here.

815
01:16:06,106 --> 01:16:07,274
-Okay.
-This place is nice.

816
01:16:07,357 --> 01:16:08,775
YI-SEO AND SAEROYI

817
01:16:14,823 --> 01:16:16,658
One, two, three.

818
01:16:24,374 --> 01:16:25,667
-Do you want me to take it?
-No.

819
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:26,584
No?

820
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:28,169
<i>Take a picture of me.</i>

821
01:16:33,341 --> 01:16:35,760
-You said you love me, right?
-What? Yes.

822
01:16:38,763 --> 01:16:39,639
I did.

823
01:16:43,059 --> 01:16:43,935
But

824
01:16:44,853 --> 01:16:46,479
why do you not hold my hand?

825
01:16:51,109 --> 01:16:52,152
Oh, well...

826
01:16:54,154 --> 01:16:54,988
It's just...

827
01:16:57,657 --> 01:16:58,992
It feels a little awkward.

828
01:17:02,954 --> 01:17:04,164
I feel the same way.

829
01:17:36,946 --> 01:17:38,073
I'll try my best

830
01:17:44,204 --> 01:17:45,872
You and I are

831
01:17:46,915 --> 01:17:48,917
different from A to Z.

832
01:17:50,168 --> 01:17:51,628
But we have one thing in common.

833
01:17:54,547 --> 01:17:55,590
One thing in common?

834
01:17:56,758 --> 01:17:58,051
Yes.

835
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:03,598
We don't know the warmth of people.

836
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,606
When I heard

837
01:18:12,982 --> 01:18:15,110
about your past the other day,

838
01:18:19,364 --> 01:18:21,324
I wanted to embrace

839
01:18:23,243 --> 01:18:25,078
all your painful past.

840
01:18:27,872 --> 01:18:30,125
I didn't want you to suffer.

841
01:18:33,128 --> 01:18:34,337
I didn't want you to be lonely.

842
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:42,887
I wanted to make

843
01:18:45,056 --> 01:18:46,891
your bitter night sweet.

844
01:18:57,152 --> 01:18:58,903
When I think of you,

845
01:19:01,448 --> 01:19:03,283
my empty life

846
01:19:06,744 --> 01:19:08,580
fills up with you.

847
01:19:16,713 --> 01:19:17,797
Thank you.

848
01:19:25,096 --> 01:19:26,097
I love you.

849
01:19:29,976 --> 01:19:31,728
I will make you happy.

850
01:19:57,837 --> 01:19:59,214
<i>I wanted to be happy.</i>

851
01:20:02,425 --> 01:20:03,760
<i>Without losing myself,</i>

852
01:20:05,512 --> 01:20:07,597
<i>I wanted to achieve everything I want.</i>

853
01:20:12,602 --> 01:20:14,062
<i>There were difficult days.</i>

854
01:20:19,192 --> 01:20:20,151
<i>Sometimes,</i>

855
01:20:22,987 --> 01:20:24,364
<i>I was nervous and afraid.</i>

856
01:20:33,831 --> 01:20:35,166
<i>How did I get through all that?</i>

857
01:20:36,251 --> 01:20:37,293
We can...

858
01:20:37,377 --> 01:20:38,711
-Do it!
-Do it!

859
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:40,672
<i>With my loved ones,</i>

860
01:20:42,048 --> 01:20:44,634
<i>I've led a hectic life
doing what I want to do.</i>

861
01:20:45,218 --> 01:20:46,678
-We got this!
-We got this!

862
01:20:48,054 --> 01:20:49,138
<i>Staying with them.</i>

863
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,474
<i>Sharing my life</i>

864
01:20:53,142 --> 01:20:54,143
<i>with them.</i>

865
01:20:58,856 --> 01:21:00,024
<i>In search of happiness.</i>

866
01:21:16,124 --> 01:21:17,333
I love you,

868

<i>Happiness.</i>

869
01:22:06,257 --> 01:22:07,800
<i>The warmth I share with you.</i>

870
01:22:42,043 --> 01:22:43,252
<i>I'm already</i>

871
01:22:55,848 --> 01:22:57,183

872
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:02,814
<i>I could be.</i>

874
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,344
I love you

Let's drink.
