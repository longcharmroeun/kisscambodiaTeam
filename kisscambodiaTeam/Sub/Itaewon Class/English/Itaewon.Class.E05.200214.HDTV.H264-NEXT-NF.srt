DANBAM

6
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:21,739
I want to

7
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,866
work here.

8
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,870
What do you mean? You want to work here?

9
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:29,747
Yes.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,918
Thanks for the offer,
but I've already found someone.

11
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:37,713
Sorry?

12
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:41,675
Yi-seo.

13
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,386
Geun-soo?

14
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,305
What brings you here?

15
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:48,974
What's going on?
What the heck are you doing here?

16
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:55,814
He's going to work here from now on.

17
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:57,274
That's right.

18
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,528
What?

19
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:08,494
11 YEARS AGO

20
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:12,164
<i>My brother got beaten up
by someone at school.</i>

21
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:13,582
Say hi, will you?

22
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:18,462
<i>He needed someone
to take his anger out on, so he hit me.</i>

23
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:25,219
<i>I was born out of wedlock.</i>

24
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,850
What happened to your face?

25
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:34,395
I think he and Geun-won fought.

26
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,109
What time is the meeting
with Minister Kim?

27
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:41,735
It's at 5 p.m., sir.

28
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:46,281
<i>My birth was an accident.</i>

29
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,499
-Mom.
-My gosh.

30
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,001
What happened? Did you fight with someone?

31
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,462
Geun-won hit me.

32
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,967
Don't fight. Try to get along with him.

33
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:08,345
Where are you going?

34
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,597
I'm going shopping
to take a look at some new stuff!

35
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:13,392
<i>I was</i>

36
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,228
<i>never loved by anyone.</i>

37
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,399
-<i>Seventeen years went by like that.</i>
-So you want to attend

38
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,110
a high school in Seoul?

39
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,114
-While living all by yourself?
-Yes.

40
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:30,200
"SIK" TO EAT

41
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:34,246
THE STRONG PREY ON THE WEAK

42
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,497
"The strong prey on the weak."

43
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:38,375
It's the fundamental law of this world.

44
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:41,753
This is my all-time favorite saying.

45
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:43,839
It suits you.

46
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:46,842
Do you not like living here?

47
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,927
I'm comfortable here.

48
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,306
-What's there not to like?
-Then why

49
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,850
do you want to leave?

50
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:57,728
Dad.

51
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,356
No one needs me here,

52
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:04,693
and I feel the same way. That's all.

53
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:08,363
You were born out of wedlock.

54
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:12,075
You're incompetent and young.

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,870
The weak

56
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:17,539
must rely on the strong to survive.

57
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,126
You should've just gotten a dog instead.

58
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,338
You idiot.

59
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:28,008
I won't try to stop you. Do what you want.

60
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:30,302
<i>When you don't expect anything,</i>

61
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,721
<i>you don't get disappointed.</i>

62
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,059
<i>If I could move out of here...</i>

BOGWANG KOSIWON
BOGWANG DORM

64
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:42,231
<i>...I'd feel free anywhere I go.</i>

65
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:47,986
<i>I'm doing well.</i>

66
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,322
<i>Without anyone's help.</i>

67
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,742
<i>All on my own.</i>

68
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,416
You can't take responsibility.
That's why you're a minor.

69
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:03,669
Kiddie.

70
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:08,382
<i>I felt like I met a real adult
for the first time in my life.</i>

71
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,760
<i>He suffered huge damage because of me.</i>

72
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:14,471
<i>How could he be like this?</i>

73
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,723
You want to work part-time?

74
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,559
Yes.

75
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:20,852
<i>I had met him only once,</i>

76
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:23,772
<i>but it was enough.</i>

77
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:28,026
I was thinking about possibly hiring
one more part-timer.

78
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,112
But why, all of a sudden?

79
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,114
<i>I want to rely on this guy.</i>

80
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,783
I need some spending money.

81
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:37,369
<i>I inconvenienced him,</i>

82
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,163
<i>so I want to make up for it.</i>

83
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:43,792
Okay, then.

84
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,054
What the hell?

85
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,724
You little shit.

86
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:02,311
How dare you come here?

87
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:05,647
-Hello.
-Your name is Jang Geun-soo?

88
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,025
-Yes.
-Say hi.

89
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,319
His name is Jang Geun-soo,
and he's going to work with us.

90
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:12,029
Sae-ro-yi.

91
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:17,576
Well, having a handsome guy around
will brighten up the ambiance.

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,661
Why are you staring at me though?

93
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,538
-Are you implying that I'm ugly?
-Yes.

94
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,790
I agree, for the same reason.

95
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,461
Geun-soo can be your part-time server.
I'll be the manager.

96
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:29,129
What?

97
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:31,548
What bullshit are you talking about?

98
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,062
-You said your name is Cho Yi-seo.
-Yes.

99
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,855
Our store space isn't big,

100
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:49,399
and I'm always here,
so we don't need a manager.

101
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,819
But you, as the owner, need help.
That's why you need a manager.

102
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:55,656
-Jeez, you little piece of--
-Hey, don't.

103
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:57,783
Sorry.

104
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,582
What makes you say that?
You think I need help with marketing?

105
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,836
Mr. Scary Face.

106
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,882
Can you bring out
a basic item on the menu?

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,344
-What?
-I want to show you why you guys need me.

108
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,429
Just bring out something.

109
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,557
-You little shit.
-Bring her something. I'm curious.

110
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,726
Okay.

111
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,729
Treat me like a customer, please.

112
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,868
-Here you go.
-Stop right there.

113
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,831
He's doing something wrong.
Do you know what it is?

114
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:53,964
His face?

115
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:56,925
Sae-ro-yi, please.

116
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:02,764
Well, not necessarily. Look at his hand.

117
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:06,893
This filthy hand, which he could've used
to wipe his butt or pick his nose.

118
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:10,105
Your fingers should not be touching
the inside of the pot.

119
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,774
Basic rule number one.
When you're serving food,

120
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:14,526
your hands must be placed on the outside.

121
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:18,989
-She does have a point.
-Yes, she does.

122
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,116
Let's see.

123
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,827
SOFT TOFU STEW, SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK

124
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,543
What is your specialty?

125
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,137
We carefully came up with every recipe,
but we don't really have a specialty.

126
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,346
This is too disorderly.

127
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:45,766
I have no idea what to order.

128
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,024
PHOTO

129
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,109
Hey, customer. What are you doing now?

130
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:58,945
There's no decor theme,
but more importantly,

131
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:00,655
it's too bright here.

132
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:02,949
What pub uses
fluorescent lights like these?

133
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,411
Make me one of the popular items
on the menu.

134
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,210
Here are your chicken gizzards.

135
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:19,090
Look at this.

136
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:21,343
It looks so unappetizing.

137
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,763
There's nothing special about it,
and it doesn't even look nice.

138
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:27,015
I wouldn't eat here
even if I lived nearby.

139
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,601
Who'd come all the way to Itaewon
for this?

140
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,445
And it tastes awful.

141
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,491
I want to rinse my mouth with soju.

142
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,959
First, put all the chairs down.

143
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:09,432
You need to think about how people
are going to move within the space.

144
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,690
Anyway, that's enough for today.

145
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,441
Agreed.

146
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:20,735
Think wisely.

147
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:22,654
What?

148
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:24,990
I'm like Zhuge Liang.

149
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,492
I'm Merlin and Rayleigh.

150
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:30,412
Someone you absolutely need.

151
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:34,040
You didn't need to lift a finger
to hire me. I came here voluntarily.

152
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,418
"I'm doing a good enough job.

153
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,753
She's just a 20-year-old kid
who knows nothing."

154
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,840
If you still feel that you don't need me,

155
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,426
then that's fine.

156
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,221
I wouldn't want to work
with such an idiot anyway.

157
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,686
What do you say?
You still don't think you need me?

158
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,151
All right.

159
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,986
I did find that helpful.

160
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,197
-Does that mean--
-At the moment, I can only

161
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:07,866
employ four people, including Geun-soo,

162
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,619
based on the square footage
and all the expenses.

163
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:12,662
I admit that you're great,

164
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,831
but I can't hire another person
when I'm fully staffed.

165
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,000
I can't afford to pay you.

166
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,587
If you find me helpful and great,
the solution is simple.

167
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,381
-Why don't you get rid of him or--
-Fire someone

168
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:24,799
just to hire you?

169
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,343
I can't do that.

170
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,642
Why do you want to work here?

171
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:38,772
My gut tells me I should.

172
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:41,816
Your gut?

173
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:45,320
I feel like

174
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,281
you're worth the gamble with my life.

175
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:50,784
My instinct tells me so.

176
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,176
That's interesting.

177
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:10,053
What?

178
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:17,686
Listen up, guys.

179
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:21,106
As of this moment, this girl, Cho Yi-seo,

180
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,115
is the manager of DanBam.

181
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,460
Hey, applaud.

182
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:58,977
LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS

183
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:00,353
Due to the stock purchase,

184
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:03,523
Ms. Kang Min-jung's shares
went up by 1.2 percent.

185
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,650
So 7.9 percent in total?

186
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,194
KANG MIN-JUNG SHARE PERCENTAGE
7.9128%

187
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:10,238
What if we add up her supporters' shares?

188
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:11,823
If we add up everything,

189
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:15,160
it'll probably be over 25 percent.

190
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,960
I see, 25 percent.

191
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,839
We're number one in the industry,
you know. I have no other intentions.

192
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,508
Still, I think it's a bit much.

193
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,510
Don't overstretch yourself.

194
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:36,347
I met a good fund manager,
so I made some money in stocks recently.

195
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,975
I can handle it.

196
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,979
You don't have an ulterior motive?

197
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:47,609
Like what?

198
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,423
Look, we can put
at least two more tables here.

199
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,593
The space is tight,
so we need to do this to put more tables.

200
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,892
I organized it yesterday. It's all clean.

201
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,103
We don't need many things on the menu.

202
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:24,979
Just have one specialty

203
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:27,023
and use two or three
overlapping ingredients

204
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,817
to keep losses to a minimum.

205
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,239
Where did you learn to cook?

206
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,200
I didn't really "learn" it, per se.

207
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:39,661
I could tell.

208
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,580
-What?
-Let me know when the menu is ready.

209
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,668
-Over there.
-Jeez.

210
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:48,628
Don't shake it.

211
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:50,380
Don't talk to me. I'm afraid of height.

212
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,048
-Shall I hang this here?
-Yes.

213
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,154
Should this go here?

214
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,949
Yes. We'll be done sooner than I thought.

215
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,077
Sae-ro-yi got most of the things done
last night.

216
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:24,205
-Really?
-Yes.

217
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:26,708
Then he's probably still sleeping.

218
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:28,459
When will he get here?

219
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,629
No, he's here.
He got here earlier in the day.

220
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:32,797
Where is he?

221
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,438
How long have you been working out here?

222
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:50,190
Hey, you.

223
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:52,108
I'm almost done.

224
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,819
Did you sleep?
What time did you go to bed?

225
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:58,281
-What?
-You set up everything inside last night.

226
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,949
And now, you're working out here.

227
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,785
What are you thinking? Will you
overwork yourself and faint again?

228
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:06,331
I couldn't fall asleep.

229
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,835
<i>I can't sleep well at night.</i>

230
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:12,503
I feel nostalgic,

231
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:14,839
lonely,

232
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,051
and upset.

233
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:23,598
If you hang them in a row,
it looks boring.

234
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,184
Hang them at different heights.

235
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,645
I see.

236
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:32,982
Tomorrow is our grand opening.

237
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:34,525
Yes.

238
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:38,363
What do you think

239
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,407
will help you sleep better at night?

240
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:50,792
What do you mean?

241
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,545
I just want you to get better sleep.

242
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,010
You don't need to worry about that.

243
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,063
OPEN D-1, LOOK FORWARD
TO NEW AND IMPROVED DANBAM

244
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:53,479
JANG'S GROUP

245
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,251
You asked for me?

246
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,503
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir.

247
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,674
What is this?

248
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:24,093
You're already 30.

249
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,054
NAME SEO JUNG-IN
WORKS AT JEA FOODS

250
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:28,431
Dad.

251
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,641
Her father owns Jea Foods.
You should meet her.

252
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:32,477
But...

253
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,147
I want to find and date someone naturally.

254
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:39,859
You lunatic.

255
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:42,403
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

256
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:44,280
Do you not want the company?

257
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:48,076
Do you think it'll automatically
become yours when I die?

258
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,996
But it has nothing to do with that.

259
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,832
Are you aware of your position
within the company right now?

260
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,918
All you do is cause trouble.

261
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:58,795
You're my son
but have nothing else to offer.

262
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,172
You need to marry
into the Jea Foods family at least.

263
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,133
-But Dad--
-I don't want to hear it.

264
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,928
Just do as I say.

265
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:12,308
Leave.

266
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,447
Meet someone naturally for marriage?

267
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:29,867
He's so immature.

268
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,371
I've been observing him for a long time,

269
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,958
and I think he has a crush on Ms. Oh.

270
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,460
What?

271
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,052
Yi-seo!

272
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:53,057
-Headed to DanBam?
-Yes.

273
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:55,810
What's with the mask?

274
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,353
Are you sick?

275
00:18:58,354 --> 00:18:59,814
Look at the sky.

276
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:03,359
Do you want one?
The fine dust levels are very bad today.

277
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:07,697
We still have a few hours until we open.
Why are you going in so early?

278
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:13,202
Because it's our first day.
There are many things I have to check.

279
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,664
-You're working so hard.
-I always work hard.

280
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,168
Well, has your mom said anything?

281
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:22,128
About what?

282
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,172
You working instead of going to college.

283
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:27,133
Knowing your mom, she would throw a fit.

284
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,262
Don't stick your nose
into others' family affairs.

285
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:33,306
To be honest, I've been curious.

286
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:36,517
I mean, you make enough money
through your blog.

287
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:39,270
Why would you give up
on going to college and work?

288
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:43,900
Then why did you decide to work at DanBam?

289
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:48,446
I just didn't want to keep
feeling indebted to Sae-ro-yi.

290
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,700
And you think your dad
died because of me, right?

291
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,707
Do you even know what kind of relationship
your brother has with him?

292
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,002
What?
Do you know something that I don't know?

293
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,923
Forget it. I shouldn't stick my nose
into your family matters.

294
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,636
Jeez, you're still so obnoxious.

295
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:16,307
Hold on. Come to think of it,
it's quite fascinating.

296
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:20,269
What did Sae-ro-yi see in you
that he hired you as the manager?

297
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,480
<i>My gut instinct.</i>

298
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,649
Your gut instinct?

299
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:27,109
So you hired her for the same reason?

300
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:30,321
You hired her when we're fully staffed
just because of your gut instinct

301
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:31,822
and even made her the manager?

302
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:33,866
She's just a 20-year-old kid.

303
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,537
My gut instinct told me
that it'd be a good investment.

304
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,872
You're weird sometimes.

305
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,833
Shall I say I'm convinced?

306
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,253
What was it like to work with her?

307
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:47,213
Well, she is rude.

308
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,174
-But she knows what she's doing.
-I agree.

309
00:20:50,258 --> 00:20:52,593
But I don't think she likes me.

310
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:55,721
Right, she hates you because
you two are like two peas in a pod.

311
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:57,139
You're so obnoxious too.

312
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:01,102
I see. I should make something with tofu
for dinner because you hate it.

313
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:03,771
Should I just beat you up and go to jail?

314
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:06,232
-Go ahead and beat me up.
-Everyone's here.

315
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,902
-Hello.
-Hi, speak of the devil.

316
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:13,030
Everyone's here now,
so shall we get started?

317
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,949
I want to say something.

318
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,367
May I?

319
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:18,202
Sure.

320
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,208
Let's put our hands together
for a little pep talk.

321
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:27,253
Hands? Jeez, forget it. Just say it.

322
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:30,548
The manager is telling us to do it.
Come on, guys.

323
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:36,846
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

324
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:44,145
Thank you for everything.

325
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:47,481
It mustn't have been easy
to trust and listen to a 20-year-old.

326
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:50,109
But you've all been patiently
following my lead.

327
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:54,155
I assure you that we'll be rewarded
for all our hard work.

328
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:02,079
Now, we'll rule Itaewon.

329
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:05,207
Put your hand up. DanBam.

330
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,335
-We got this!
-We got this!

331
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:08,836
<i>DanBam Pub's grand opening.</i>

332
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,422
<i>DanBam Pub in Itaewon is back,
new and improved.</i>

333
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:13,507
<i>I bet you want to know what's new.</i>

334
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:16,510
<i>We expanded
to be able to accept more customers.</i>

335
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:19,138
<i>Those of you who haven't been yet,
visit us before it's too late.</i>

336
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:20,139
<i>It's finally open.</i>

337
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,766
<i>-That guy's hot.
-Let's go this weekend.</i>

338
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,517
<i>I took a picture with Yi-seo.</i>

339
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,145
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

340
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,106
I want this.

341
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:32,193
I'm so excited.

342
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:33,486
DANBAM

343
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,779
I WANT TO GET TIPSY TONIGHT

344
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,781
STEAMED SQUID
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK

345
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,137
Sure, thank you.

346
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,182
DANBAM

347
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,732
OPEN
DANBAM

348
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:17,905
Let me know if you need anything.

349
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:35,589
DANBAM
CLOSED

350
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,049
TOTAL SALES: 3,200,000

351
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:42,430
This was our first day.
How did that happen?

352
00:23:42,513 --> 00:23:45,349
Yi-seo posted about our grand opening
on her blog and social media.

353
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,728
All those people came because of that?

354
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:52,690
What's our total?

355
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:56,610
We did 3,200,000 won.

356
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:58,946
What? 3,200,000 won? On a weekday?

357
00:24:00,448 --> 00:24:03,617
I know, right? It's amazing.
It's the best we've ever done.

358
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:06,787
It won't last. This kind of advertising
is only effective short-term.

359
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:10,750
We must make sure
these customers come back.

360
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:14,962
But how, specifically?

361
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,216
Not sure.

362
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,063
JANGGA PUB

363
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:56,921
It's good.

364
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,006
The taste lives up to our standards.

365
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,466
Thank you.

366
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,635
It's all thanks to your recipe, sir.

367
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:05,179
Would you like to see
the monthly sales report?

368
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,806
I already saw it.

369
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:09,183
The numbers have gone up
since you joined them.

370
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:11,185
Thank you, sir.

371
00:25:12,353 --> 00:25:15,189
By the way,
what brings you here at this hour?

372
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,026
Can you step out briefly?

373
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,573
I found a decent girl for Geun-won.

374
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:26,992
I see.

375
00:25:30,454 --> 00:25:33,123
But it sounds like
he has feelings for you.

376
00:25:36,794 --> 00:25:39,505
That fool. I guess you don't feel
the same way about him.

377
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,216
You got the wrong idea, sir.

378
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:43,968
"Wrong idea"?

379
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:46,595
Here's what's interesting.

380
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,682
If you were interested in dating him,

381
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,017
I wouldn't be against it.

382
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:53,602
Sir.

383
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:55,813
Don't mind me.

384
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:59,775
This old man won't meddle
in your youngsters' love life.

385
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:03,988
I'm just letting you know
that I approve of you.

386
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,951
I know that you're torn
between me and Min-jung.

387
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,914
I'm a mere employee, sir.

388
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:15,082
Right.

389
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,836
I've always thought that was enough,

390
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,297
but I hate losing,

391
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:23,883
so it really bothers me.

392
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:25,968
Pardon me?

393
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,847
I told you that I think of you
as part of my family.

394
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,600
You shouldn't be neutral.

395
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,810
You have to be on my side.

396
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:37,646
Of course, sir.

397
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:41,358
You've always been like this.

398
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:43,527
You never say what I don't want to hear.

399
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:47,823
It is time for action,

400
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,661
not words.

401
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,289
"Actions"? What do you mean, sir?

402
00:26:58,876 --> 00:26:59,960
That pub over there.

403
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:01,962
DANBAM

404
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:03,088
DanBam.

405
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:09,011
So this is Park Sae-ro-yi's pub, right?

406
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,017
It's doing well.

407
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,602
He managed to revive it

408
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,771
after getting it suspended
as if nothing had happened.

409
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:23,233
They just reopened, sir.
You shouldn't be concerned with it.

410
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:24,652
Do you really think so?

411
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,241
Or do you want to protect him
because he's your friend?

412
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,501
HAMILTON HOTEL

413
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:41,835
<i>Many people leave</i>

414
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,838
by the time the subway service stops,
so most places close by then.

415
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:48,509
But there are still passersby.

416
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,095
I also think we can attract people
who work in the area.

417
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:55,307
How about we extend our hours
to when the subway service resumes?

418
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:13,826
Hey, Soo-ah. Are you headed home?

419
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:17,121
Yes.

420
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:20,874
Why is it so hard to see you?

421
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,960
You've been ignoring my calls and texts.

422
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:28,382
-If it's because you're sorry--
-I'm ignoring you on purpose.

423
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:31,385
Don't call me.

424
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,066
DANBAM, CLOSED

425
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,317
DANBAM, OPEN

426
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:59,413
Table eight wants
a milder squid <i>jjamppong</i>.

427
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:00,748
Got it.

428
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:05,753
Boss.

429
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:08,630
Table 12 wants their stir-fried spicy pork
to be really spicy.

430
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:09,673
Okay.

431
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:18,932
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Bye.

432
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:25,022
We can finally take a break.

433
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:26,940
How much did we sell?

434
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,109
We sold 2,500,000 won.

435
00:29:30,527 --> 00:29:32,029
That's less than yesterday.

436
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:34,364
Today is a weekday. We're doing amazing.

437
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:36,492
We barely used to make 1,000,000 won
on the weekends.

438
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:42,331
Sae-ro-yi really is amazing.

439
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,959
Today's Hyun-yi's day off,
so he cooked everything by himself.

440
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,878
Yes, he's a great cook.

441
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:52,341
Let's eat.

442
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,884
-Okay.
-Okay.

443
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,561
My gosh.

444
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,356
This is the best soft tofu stew
I've ever had.

445
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:09,983
I just follow the recipe.

446
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:14,822
How did you end up hiring the cook?

447
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,116
Hyun-yi?

448
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,869
We used to work in the same factory.

449
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:22,663
What? I didn't know that.

450
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,665
I thought he used to be a cook.

451
00:30:24,748 --> 00:30:28,001
Why did you hire him as a cook
when he's never worked in the kitchen?

452
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,341
Because I really liked the lunch

453
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,010
he once made for me.

454
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:43,725
Eat up and go home.

455
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,811
We're done cleaning,
so I'll finish up the rest.

456
00:30:46,353 --> 00:30:47,229
Really?

457
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,824
The bus isn't running yet,
and we need to wait a bit longer.

458
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,285
Do you want to go clubbing?

459
00:31:02,536 --> 00:31:04,496
-Club?
-That sounds like an idea.

460
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:10,335
Well...

461
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:13,589
Is it fun?

462
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:14,715
What?

463
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:17,759
What do you mean? Clubbing?

464
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:20,053
I've never been.

465
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:21,638
What? Really?

466
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:24,141
You've never been clubbing at that age?

467
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,059
Why?

468
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:27,227
Don't you like clubbing?

469
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,855
I'm not a very good dancer.

470
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:31,398
That doesn't matter.

471
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:33,984
There are tons of people there,
so no one will notice.

472
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:36,570
This is all you have to do.

473
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,073
Just dance to the rhythm,
and your body will do the rest.

474
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:48,832
Like this?

475
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:55,756
Yes, like that.

476
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,133
-I'm sorry.
-She says I'm fine.

477
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:02,763
When people go clubbing,

478
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:06,767
do they really twerk and grind

479
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,102
-and end up dating each other?
-What's the matter with you?

480
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:11,188
-Why? Did I sound perverted?
-My gosh.

481
00:32:11,313 --> 00:32:14,942
What's so perverted about
hitting on the person you're attracted to?

482
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:16,193
It's a natural instinct.

483
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:19,613
People go clubbing to dance,
listen to music,

484
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,490
and to have fun with the opposite sex.

485
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:22,699
Then

486
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,495
I want to grind.

487
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,330
My gosh, will you stop?

488
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:31,416
What a pervert.

489
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,711
-You little punk.
-Okay.

490
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:36,463
-What do you want?
-Come over here.

491
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:38,090
What? Why?

492
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:41,051
Let me teach you how it normally works.

493
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,845
Let's say this is the person you like.

494
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,306
The club will most definitely be packed.

495
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,810
You need to walk through the crowd
and stand right behind her.

496
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:51,561
Then let her know that you're there.

497
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:53,230
-Like this.
-My gosh.

498
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:56,775
Stretch your arms out so she can see
and start dancing to the rhythm.

499
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:01,863
Then she'll slowly realize
that a guy is starting to hit on her.

500
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:03,865
What if she doesn't like it?

501
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:07,035
It's not like you're going to touch her
or anything.

502
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:09,288
She dolled up and came to the club.

503
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,581
Whether she likes you or not,

504
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:14,334
her ego will boost
just because a guy hit on her.

505
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:18,505
She might turn you down,
but she won't hate it.

506
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:20,257
Unless the guy is really ugly.

507
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:23,677
But I personally think

508
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,097
you'll be fine. You're not too bad.

509
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:31,560
And don't let it get to you
even if she doesn't like you.

510
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,146
She won't be the last woman
you'll ever meet.

511
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:35,981
-Right.
-Think of it comfortably.

512
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:37,149
Okay.

513
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,735
Let's try it again. Come here.

514
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,653
As you dance behind her,

515
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:44,448
slowly move your body closer to hers.

516
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:45,782
Hey.

517
00:33:47,117 --> 00:33:48,702
But don't make it too obvious.

518
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:50,829
-Okay.
-Move to the rhythm,

519
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:54,207
and make it seem like your body
accidentally brushed against hers.

520
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:58,295
Then she'll turn around and check you out.

521
00:33:58,378 --> 00:34:03,759
That's when you should put on a big smile
to show her that you're having a blast.

522
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,427
Like a happy kid.

523
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:09,931
This is important.

524
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:13,310
But if she turns around and glares at you,

525
00:34:13,393 --> 00:34:16,605
then you should know
that you have no hope.

526
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,106
You should just give up.

527
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,108
But if she smiles back at you,

528
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:22,819
that means she likes you too.

529
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:24,613
Then you can start getting closer.

530
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:28,450
Hold her shoulder and dance to the beat.

531
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,746
Start dancing to the music together.

532
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:35,207
Then slowly place your hand on her waist.

533
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,333
My gosh, hey.

534
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:41,421
After you dance with her a bit more
and give her a few compliments...

535
00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:45,092
-Yes?
-Aren't you thirsty?

536
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,762
I have a table over there
Do you want to drink with me?

537
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:52,766
That's all you need to say to her.

538
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:57,646
-Then the night will be yours.
-Gosh, that's nuts.

539
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:58,563
I'm so excited.

540
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:00,816
What?

541
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,447
What's wrong with you?

542
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:09,699
Why would we grab a table?

543
00:35:09,783 --> 00:35:11,910
It's okay. He'll pay for it.

544
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:15,997
Should we get going?

545
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:19,960
Okay, let's hurry up. Come on. Let's go!

546
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,309
Why is this bottle so expensive here?

547
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,271
It's not that bad today
because today's a weekday.

548
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,398
It's three times more expensive
on the weekends.

549
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:44,526
My gosh, she's just trying to rip you off.

550
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,319
I'll pitch in.

551
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:48,655
No, it's okay.
I'm the oldest, so I should pay.

552
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:53,577
I'm impressed. What do you think?
It's your first time here.

553
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,620
It's loud and distracting.

554
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,332
But I like what I'm seeing.

555
00:36:01,877 --> 00:36:03,503
Then have a shot.

556
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:07,799
-Let's have some fun.
-Okay. Cheers.

557
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:08,925
Cheers.

558
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,905
<i>It's not good to hit on multiple women.</i>

559
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:33,909
<i>"Is he hitting on me
after he got rejected by her?"</i>

560
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,702
<i>You don't want a woman to think that.</i>

561
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:39,623
<i>Your first choice is very important.</i>

562
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:52,844
<i>My first choice</i>

563
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:54,888
<i>is you.</i>

564
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,566
He's going to make a move.

565
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:09,945
He is too picky.

566
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,537
<i>Stick out my arms so she'll notice.</i>

567
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,419
<i>Don't be too obvious.
My body should lightly brush against hers.</i>

568
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:32,592
<i>Then she'll turn around and check you out.</i>

569
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:38,807
<i>That's when you should put on a big smile
to show her that you're having a blast.</i>

570
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:40,600
<i>Like a happy kid.</i>

571
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,436
<i>That's the important part.</i>

572
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,537
What are you doing?

573
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:06,459
Seung-kwon, what are you doing?

574
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,295
Do you know me?

575
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:10,463
How do you know me?

576
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,259
I want to know more about you.

577
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,399
What?

578
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:30,859
Why?

579
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:32,319
Is that...

580
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,369
Hyun-yi?

581
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,413
A transgender?

582
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:01,582
Why did you keep it a secret?

583
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:05,752
I never kept it a secret.

584
00:39:05,836 --> 00:39:07,129
Does our boss know?

585
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:11,675
-Yes.
-So does that mean

586
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:14,344
you got your surgery done?

587
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:15,721
What surgery?

588
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:18,015
No, not yet. I'm saving up to get one.

589
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:22,185
Does that mean you still have a...

590
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:23,895
Shut up.

591
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:27,024
Aren't there a lot of transgender clubs
in Itaewon?

592
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:28,692
Why did you come here?

593
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:32,613
Because I wanted to come here.

594
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,949
You don't look like it,
but you're very narrow-minded.

595
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,622
I can't believe you guys grabbed a table.

596
00:39:41,705 --> 00:39:43,165
Are you here to celebrate something?

597
00:39:44,374 --> 00:39:45,584
Well...

598
00:39:57,554 --> 00:39:59,473
I guess I making you feel uncomfortable.

599
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,560
I won't bother you.

600
00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:05,312
-Hey, wait.
-Hey, bro...

601
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,647
Have fun, you guys.

602
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,650
Hey, sis... My gosh.

603
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,401
What? Darn it.

604
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:13,362
My gosh.

605
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:21,078
Unbelievable. Hey, you remember
that pub called DanBam or whatever?

606
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:22,996
Yes, I remember. What about it?

607
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:25,791
I think Yi-seo, that bitch,
is working there.

608
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:27,501
What are you talking about?

609
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:29,252
She makes enough money
through social media.

610
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:30,962
Take a look.

611
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,756
She's right. I don't think it's part-time.

612
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:34,841
It looks like she's been given
some kind of a role.

613
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:39,179
Look at that fucking smile.
She must be having fun.

614
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:44,851
I couldn't even graduate because of her.

615
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:48,939
She must be having fun
after having ruined my life.

616
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:51,400
This girl must be out of her mind.

617
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,277
DANBAM

618
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:57,072
-Excuse me.
-Yes? Just a second.

619
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,701
We found a strand of hair in our food.

620
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:06,540
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new dish.

621
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:07,791
I'm sorry.

622
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,627
Did you ring the bell?

623
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:13,130
Yes, the stew tastes too bland.

624
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:15,382
-Oh, really?
-Can we get some salt?

625
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:18,051
Okay, sure. I'm sorry.
I'll get it for you right now.

626
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:19,136
Sorry.

627
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:29,146
What do you think you're doing?

628
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:31,231
And what is this?

629
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,234
I'm sick of saying the same thing
over and over again.

630
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:36,945
And don't you taste the food
before you serve it to the customers?

631
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:39,614
Do you just do the bare minimum

632
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:43,577
and wait until you get paid?
You must think life is so easy.

633
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:45,579
If you're not good enough,

634
00:41:45,662 --> 00:41:48,415
you should at least have the guts to quit.

635
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:50,709
Why do you even work here

636
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:53,336
when you can't even cook properly?

637
00:41:55,756 --> 00:41:58,258
What is it? What's going on?

638
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:31,249
<i>A transgender?</i>

639
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:34,044
What about that?

640
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:37,255
What?

641
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:42,052
You really knew?

642
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:43,678
I found out at the factory.

643
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:46,807
What? Then I was the only one
who didn't know?

644
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,892
Let me ask you something.

645
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:50,519
Why did you hire him?

646
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,564
What kind of question is that?
I hired him to cook.

647
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:58,068
Yes. But he just can't cook.

648
00:42:58,652 --> 00:43:00,695
It's the only problem we have.

649
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,864
PR, good service, and a nice ambiance

650
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:04,491
isn't enough to secure customers.

651
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,494
The most important thing
is to have good food.

652
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:10,038
But the food doesn't taste that nice.

653
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:13,083
We won't be able to last very long.

654
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,711
What's your point?

655
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:20,465
Fire him.

656
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:23,343
-Hey, what are you--
-I know you care

657
00:43:23,552 --> 00:43:25,387
and that you're a good person.

658
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:27,848
And I like that about you.

659
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:32,769
But what kind of a cook
can't cook better than the owner?

660
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:36,106
On top of that, what if people find out
that he's a transgender?

661
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:38,525
It will definitely make some people
feel uncomfortable.

662
00:43:39,192 --> 00:43:41,278
We're not here to play around.

663
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:44,614
DanBam can do much better.

664
00:43:45,198 --> 00:43:48,535
I know you feel sorry to do this.

665
00:43:50,412 --> 00:43:51,746
You have to make a decision.

666
00:44:01,423 --> 00:44:02,632
Geun-soo.

667
00:44:03,592 --> 00:44:04,843
Yes?

668
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:07,012
Bring Hyun-yi.

669
00:44:10,765 --> 00:44:11,683
But...

670
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:14,019
-Hey, boss--
-Bring him here.

671
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,081
How do you feel

672
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:37,584
working here?

673
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:39,210
Do you enjoy it?

674
00:44:44,966 --> 00:44:45,926
Yes.

675
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:52,807
I know everyone is doing their best.

676
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,225
But it's not enough.

677
00:44:57,938 --> 00:45:01,483
I want DanBam to become a huge business.

678
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,112
But the biggest problem we have right now

679
00:45:07,948 --> 00:45:09,032
is your food.

680
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,121
It's not that good.

681
00:45:29,386 --> 00:45:31,221
You know you're not doing well enough,

682
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:33,014
right?

683
00:45:39,062 --> 00:45:40,271
I understand.

684
00:45:56,204 --> 00:45:57,414
Take this.

685
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:58,957
Hey, boss.

686
00:46:07,257 --> 00:46:08,550
It's your pay for this month.

687
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,438
Thank you for everything until now.

688
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:22,731
It's twice your pay.

689
00:46:32,866 --> 00:46:34,826
If you like working here,

690
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:38,663
I want you to work twice as hard.

691
00:46:46,212 --> 00:46:47,213
Can you do that?

692
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:02,645
Yes.

693
00:47:12,405 --> 00:47:13,490
Did you hear that?

694
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:17,202
-Sir--
-And let me tell you something.

695
00:47:17,786 --> 00:47:18,828
Listen carefully.

696
00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:26,002
The world

697
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,880
avoids people like me
because I'm an ex-convict.

698
00:47:29,798 --> 00:47:33,093
And the three of you,
Yi-seo, Geun-soo, and Seung-kwon...

699
00:47:33,176 --> 00:47:36,179
You guys recently made a scene
and got me suspended.

700
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:37,806
Hyun-yi?

701
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:40,767
He's done nothing but work hard

702
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,728
without causing us any trouble.

703
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:45,897
Just like you guys,

704
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,361
he's one of my people.

705
00:47:57,992 --> 00:47:59,452
That's what matters.

706
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,122
You might feel uncomfortable
around Hyun-yi.

707
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:03,748
I'd appreciate it if you understand him.

708
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,459
And I can't force you to do that.

709
00:48:07,877 --> 00:48:11,506
But if you have a problem working with him
just because he's transgender,

710
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,180
you have to tell me now.

711
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:24,811
No matter who it is,

712
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:34,070
I'll make my decision.

713
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,337
What else can I say?

714
00:48:56,968 --> 00:48:57,969
Let's do this right.

715
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:04,642
I'll work hard.

716
00:49:07,729 --> 00:49:09,898
I'll go check the order list.

717
00:49:32,295 --> 00:49:35,506
How eventful it's been.

718
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:36,758
Long time no see.

719
00:49:41,596 --> 00:49:42,555
Are you ignoring us?

720
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:45,975
Aren't you supposed to say hello
to your friends from school.

721
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:50,897
Why am I your friend
when you didn't even graduate?

722
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:52,899
You crazy bitch.

723
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:53,900
Hey.

724
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:59,405
-What's going on?
-Stay out of this, Jang Geun-soo.

725
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:00,782
You stay out of this.

726
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,617
You're 20 now.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

727
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,536
I've been nothing but nice to you
because you're cute.

728
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,996
Did you forget it?

729
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,916
What good is it going to do for me?

730
00:50:11,668 --> 00:50:12,835
Nothing.

731
00:50:13,586 --> 00:50:16,464
Where are you going, you dullhead?

732
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,508
Let go.

733
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,635
Isn't getting expelled enough for you?

734
00:50:21,803 --> 00:50:23,763
Gosh, you sound so scary.

735
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,891
Isn't this reverse discrimination or what?

736
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:29,185
I got expelled from school
because my dad is a politician.

737
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:31,396
But you got away with under-age drinking.

738
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,566
Gosh, how did you know that?

739
00:50:36,025 --> 00:50:37,151
Do you shadow me?

740
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,861
Are you a stalker?

741
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:40,071
What do you think?

742
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:41,990
I know it because I called the police.

743
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:44,450
What?

744
00:50:47,161 --> 00:50:48,496
What do you mean?

745
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,664
Why?

746
00:50:49,831 --> 00:50:52,083
Do you think you'll be okay
after screwing me like that?

747
00:50:54,836 --> 00:50:55,837
Hey.

748
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:58,047
Are you insane?

749
00:50:58,631 --> 00:50:59,716
This isn't about us.

750
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:01,926
Do you even know how much
the damage the store received?

751
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,846
I don't care. It's you guys
who went there, you nut heads.

752
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,306
So

753
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:10,601
was it you who reported me to the police?

754
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:14,480
Yes. I just did what you did to me.
So what?

755
00:51:14,564 --> 00:51:15,940
She deserves more than that.

756
00:51:16,024 --> 00:51:19,027
It's just nothing compared
to what Bok-hui had to go through.

757
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:22,780
So what's the deal? Do you work there?

758
00:51:23,406 --> 00:51:26,534
Does your boss have no self-respect?
Why did he hire you?

759
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,704
Is he a pushover or something?

760
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:34,042
Shut it.

761
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,044
What?

762
00:51:36,836 --> 00:51:39,130
Are you here to have a chat with me?

763
00:51:39,714 --> 00:51:41,758
I guess you're glad to see me.

764
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:43,968
You're supposed to kick my ass.

765
00:51:44,218 --> 00:51:46,220
Isn't that why you were waiting for me?

766
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:48,639
-That's right, you bitch.
-Stop it.

767
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:53,728
Bok-hui.

768
00:51:56,189 --> 00:51:57,190
Oh, right.

769
00:51:57,857 --> 00:51:58,816
Did you not know?

770
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,111
I slapped your mom
in the face just like this.

771
00:52:02,195 --> 00:52:03,821
How dare you...

772
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,616
Gosh, I'm sorry.

773
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:14,916
Bok-hui.

774
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:19,003
Did you think you could beat me?

775
00:52:19,087 --> 00:52:20,671
You crazy bitch.

776
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:26,386
You should think about the consequences
before you do something.

777
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:28,179
You dumbhead.

778
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:33,559
There's no way you can beat me.

779
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:37,271
Because of you, my boss got suspended.

780
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:41,526
Do you even know how much the damage is?

781
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:43,027
Cho Yi-seo!

782
00:52:43,569 --> 00:52:44,654
Enough.

783
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:49,867
The person

784
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:52,286
who reported your pub to the police.

785
00:52:54,914 --> 00:52:56,082
It's me.

786
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:01,045
How annoying.

787
00:53:02,004 --> 00:53:03,089
Let go of it.

788
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:05,007
You imbecile.

789
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:26,696
<i>Seoul Police Station.</i>

790
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:32,410
<i>Hello?</i>

791
00:53:33,286 --> 00:53:34,287
Excuse me.

792
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:36,747
I called the wrong number.

793
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,458
I'm sorry.

794
00:53:47,216 --> 00:53:48,217
Damn it.

795
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:50,219
Excuse me.

796
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:54,891
Isn't that Cho Yi-seo?

797
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:57,268
It's her.

798
00:53:57,894 --> 00:54:00,480
Gosh, is she drinking?

799
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:02,148
I got you.

800
00:54:05,193 --> 00:54:07,195
Hello? Is this the police station?

801
00:54:07,904 --> 00:54:09,906
I'm in Itaewon now.

802
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:22,210
<i>Was it you who reported me to the police?</i>

803
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:23,836
Do you work there?

804
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:27,548
Does your boss have no self-respect?
Why did he hire you?

805
00:54:28,216 --> 00:54:30,801
Is he a pushover or something?

806
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:43,189
DANBAM

807
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:48,778
You seem serious.

808
00:54:49,612 --> 00:54:50,947
Is it about Hyun-yi?

809
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,534
You would suffer a loss
to keep the friendship?

810
00:54:55,117 --> 00:54:57,203
Those who do that are called pushovers.

811
00:54:59,956 --> 00:55:01,541
I know what you think,

812
00:55:01,624 --> 00:55:03,709
and I won't talk more about it.

813
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:05,962
But I haven't changed my mind yet.

814
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,714
Good.

815
00:55:11,968 --> 00:55:13,135
You're not a pushover.

816
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:18,891
Don't change your mind.

817
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:22,019
You should guide Hyun-yi
so we won't suffer a loss.

818
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:33,239
<i>How would I guide him?</i>

819
00:55:33,322 --> 00:55:34,907
<i>I know nothing about cooking.</i>

820
00:55:35,408 --> 00:55:37,785
<i>You can tell
if something tastes good or not.</i>

821
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:45,918
It's spicy but too weak.

822
00:55:46,502 --> 00:55:48,421
The solid ingredients don't
go well with the soup.

823
00:55:50,006 --> 00:55:51,090
I'll try it again.

824
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,095
<i>You just need to keep
giving her honest feedback.</i>

825
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:57,179
<i>Until you're satisfied.</i>

826
00:55:57,263 --> 00:55:59,056
I think it's well seasoned,

827
00:55:59,473 --> 00:56:01,434
but the artificial flavors
taste too strong.

828
00:56:01,934 --> 00:56:03,519
It gives an unpleasant aftertaste.

829
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,063
Oh, okay.

830
00:56:06,147 --> 00:56:07,607
Let me try it one more time.

831
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:12,778
Hyun-yi will trust your feedback
and try to improve it.

832
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,448
And someday...

833
00:56:26,959 --> 00:56:29,795
Hey, what do you think?

834
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,673
Isn't it obvious?

835
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:35,176
Yi-seo is exceptionally picky.

836
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:38,471
That nasty punk in a leather jacket.

837
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:41,849
What do you think?

838
00:56:51,817 --> 00:56:54,111
I couldn't understand Sae-ro-yi.

839
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:57,406
"Why wouldn't he just fire this person?"

840
00:57:02,662 --> 00:57:03,871
Is it bad again?

841
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:09,752
I'm just doing this
because that's my boss's order.

842
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:18,427
I'll try harder.
If you give me some time...

843
00:57:18,511 --> 00:57:19,553
It tastes good.

844
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:28,521
It's really good.

845
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:45,871
Your hair is all rough and dry.

846
00:57:46,455 --> 00:57:47,331
What?

847
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,127
You look prettier with black hair.

848
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:52,670
Sis.

849
00:58:04,598 --> 00:58:05,725
Hyun-yi.

850
00:58:18,946 --> 00:58:19,822
You did it.

851
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:23,033
You saw this coming, right?

852
00:58:23,784 --> 00:58:24,660
What?

853
00:58:25,494 --> 00:58:27,121
You gave her twice her salary.

854
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,707
If she didn't improve,

855
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,542
you would've lost the money.

856
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:34,837
I trusted Hyun-yi.

857
00:58:36,172 --> 00:58:38,007
All right.

858
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:41,260
It ended successfully anyway.

859
00:58:41,844 --> 00:58:43,304
I'll just stay quiet.

860
00:58:44,513 --> 00:58:45,890
It's not just about Hyun-yi.

861
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:47,850
I trusted you too.

862
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,856
Well done.

863
00:59:24,345 --> 00:59:25,805
<i>Apparently Park Sae-ro-yi</i>

864
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:28,891
opened a store in Itaewon.

865
00:59:28,974 --> 00:59:30,559
Did you know?

866
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,898
<i>Do you really think so?</i>

867
00:59:36,982 --> 00:59:39,401
Or do you want to protect him
because he's your friend?

868
01:00:08,389 --> 01:00:09,598
How annoying.

869
01:00:10,307 --> 01:00:11,475
<i>You made a choice.</i>

870
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:13,143
So just stick to it.

871
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:15,771
You did nothing wrong.

872
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:19,108
How annoying.

873
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:20,943
<i>Park Sae-ro-yi and me.</i>

874
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:23,779
Whom would you choose?

875
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:30,703
It's annoying.

876
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:33,122
It's so annoying!

877
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:45,134
Who is it?

878
01:00:45,426 --> 01:00:48,178
Who's so annoying?

879
01:01:01,442 --> 01:01:02,276
You.

880
01:01:05,112 --> 01:01:06,947
And you're annoyed by me.

881
01:01:07,823 --> 01:01:08,741
Right?

882
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:10,534
Just tell me.

883
01:01:14,246 --> 01:01:16,916
What's wrong? Did something happen?

884
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,752
Just be honest.

885
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:21,503
I'm disgusting.

886
01:01:22,922 --> 01:01:26,133
You're upset with what I did, right?

887
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:36,143
Will you guys go on ahead?

888
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:38,187
Okay. We will.

889
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,229
We will save you a seat.

890
01:01:39,939 --> 01:01:41,732
-Let's go, Yi-seo.
-Go on ahead.

891
01:01:55,037 --> 01:01:57,039
I've been avoiding you.

892
01:01:57,331 --> 01:02:00,709
I'm glad we met.
I wanted to ask you something.

893
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,964
What's the reason
your business is going well?

894
01:02:09,969 --> 01:02:11,595
Can't you tell me?

895
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:13,764
We're friends.

896
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:23,315
Because I have a good manager.

897
01:02:25,401 --> 01:02:26,819
I see.

898
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:28,570
That cute one?

899
01:02:31,824 --> 01:02:33,492
You're drunk. Let's go.

900
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:34,743
Let go of me.

901
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:38,706
You know what?

902
01:02:40,582 --> 01:02:43,168
I'm not sorry for you at all.

903
01:02:44,378 --> 01:02:45,504
Do you know why?

904
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:49,758
Because I'm the most precious thing to me.

905
01:02:51,552 --> 01:02:52,803
And I

906
01:02:54,513 --> 01:02:56,140
only care about myself.

907
01:02:58,183 --> 01:02:59,560
Do you think it's wrong?

908
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,982
-It's just natural.
-Bullshit.

909
01:03:07,735 --> 01:03:10,112
Hey, you know what?

910
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,283
I hate it when you pretend
to know everything like that.

911
01:03:17,077 --> 01:03:19,872
You're an ex-convict
who barely finished middle school.

912
01:03:20,414 --> 01:03:22,958
But you make me feel like shit.

913
01:03:28,714 --> 01:03:30,340
Why are you having a hard time?

914
01:03:36,805 --> 01:03:37,973
Don't be like that.

915
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:42,269
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

916
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,650
You just tried your best for your life.

917
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,236
You didn't do anything wrong.

918
01:03:56,909 --> 01:03:57,910
Please...

919
01:03:59,912 --> 01:04:03,165
Please don't say that to me.

920
01:04:06,919 --> 01:04:08,629
It's cold. Let's go.

921
01:04:17,596 --> 01:04:19,181
The thing is...

922
01:04:21,308 --> 01:04:22,518
Sae-ro-yi.

923
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:26,939
Go ahead.

924
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,404
To me...

925
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:36,824
you are...

926
01:04:46,792 --> 01:04:47,793
always

927
01:04:50,629 --> 01:04:52,005
<i>shining</i>

928
01:04:58,137 --> 01:04:59,304

Criminal Law Article 32.

931
01:05:42,347 --> 01:05:43,682
Yi-seo.

932
01:05:44,183 --> 01:05:46,393
A kiss without consent of the opposition

933
01:05:46,602 --> 01:05:48,270
is an indecent assault.

<i>I like my boss.</i>

936
01:06:20,594 --> 01:06:22,721
I'll just have to destroy you.

937
01:06:23,222 --> 01:06:25,140
My goal is to franchise DanBam.

938
01:06:25,224 --> 01:06:27,684
<i>There's no way
he will pose a threat to us.</i>

939
01:06:27,768 --> 01:06:29,895
<i>Soo-ah is in trouble
at work because of you.</i>

940
01:06:29,978 --> 01:06:31,730
But I'm sure she wouldn't want a murderer.

941
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:33,774
You seriously shouldn't like me anymore.

942
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:36,401
<i>But these days, I feel like I'm playing go
with a handicap.</i>

943
01:06:36,485 --> 01:06:38,320
<i>I'm not giving up.</i>

944
01:06:38,403 --> 01:06:39,696
You need to see this.

945
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,240
<i>How much is this?</i>

946
01:06:41,323 --> 01:06:42,491
<i>So that you won't suffer,</i>

947
01:06:42,574 --> 01:06:44,618
I'll destroy Jangga Co.
