ITAEWON CLASS

00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,889
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:15,350
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,229
NEW BUILDING OWNER

5
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,485
<i>Hello?</i>

6
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:30,490
Hello. I'm the owner of DanBam in Itaewon,
Park Saeroyi.

7
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,993
I heard you took over the building.

8
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,578
So I'm calling you to say hello.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,745
<i>Okay.</i>

10
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,455
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

11
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:39,457
Pardon?

12
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:46,256
It's me.

13
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,049
Jang Dae-hee.

14
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:02,355
Is this

15
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,358
the kind of beating you talked about?

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,238
Don't get the wrong idea.

17
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:11,865
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

18
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:13,158
I heard business in that spot

19
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,994
is doing well these days.

20
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,330
And the value of the building has gone up,

21
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:21,208
so I just thought
that it'd be a good investment.

22
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,380
Come to think of it, it's funny.

23
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:31,509
What you did to take me down

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,930
ended up benefiting my company, Jangga Co.

25
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,017
This beating is quite cunning.

26
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:44,231
Don't you have a favor to ask of me?

27
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:49,361
Come to Jangga Co. tomorrow.

28
00:01:58,745 --> 00:01:59,704
Is it Jangga?

29
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,334
EPISODE 8

30
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,462
-Yes.
-Jangga Pub?

31
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,631
They bought this building? Why?

32
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,549
I wonder too.

33
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,803
I'm so sick of them.

34
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,389
They just want to get rid of
someone they don't like.

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,724
So they just bought the building?

36
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,686
He is a man of huge caliber.

37
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:23,895
Yi-seo.

38
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:26,564
You see,

39
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:30,986
I don't even understand
how this shameless woman has the audacity

40
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,112
to come here to get ice.

41
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:35,282
And I can't wrap my head around
why Jang Geun-soo works here--

42
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:36,658
Enough!

43
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:46,960
Hey.

44
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,421
Another word and I won't let it go.

45
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:33,840
I'll go and bring Yi-seo.

46
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,179
Gosh.

47
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,556
This is so awkward.

48
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,642
That rude punk. She has such a bad temper.

49
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:46,728
I'll go get more ice.

50
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:48,646
It's okay.

51
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:53,860
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:01,159
You and the girl named Yi-seo.

53
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,162
I didn't know you were so emotional.

54
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,375
-What?
-Nothing.

55
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,878
You two seem very close.

56
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:15,715
And she has a point.

57
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:20,637
I can't borrow ice from you guys
because I feel bad.

58
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:44,452
You should've gotten a part-timer
to do this. Why carry this yourself?

59
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,165
-Give me that.
-Gosh, it's okay.

60
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,794
Ask me for favors anytime
when we're not at work.

61
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,467
Any plans for the weekend?

62
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,845
I have tickets to a musical.
They're for VIP seats.

63
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:04,806
I have an extra ticket.
Do you want to come with me?

64
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:13,982
Do you like me?

65
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:16,401
What?

66
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,656
Yes.

67
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,617
I don't like you.

68
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:28,955
Why not?

69
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,960
Because of that prick, Park Saeroyi?

70
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,339
Because of Mr. Park.

71
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,678
-What?
-The man you hit with your car

72
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,764
and killed.

73
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,479
He was like a father to me.

74
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,609
So please...

75
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,197
Stop hitting on me.

76
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,689
Sir, he's here.

77
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:53,790
We're meeting quite often these days.

78
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:55,667
I agree.

79
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,502
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

80
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,670
Let's hear it.

81
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,297
Are you here to argue with me?

82
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,095
So you wish to run the business yourself
at the spot?

83
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,097
You'd better sell it sooner than later.

84
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,974
To get the premium, that is.

85
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,934
Is that what this is about?

86
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:16,729
The premium...

87
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,276
It wouldn't be bad.

88
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,989
I know there's the Lease Protection Act,

89
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:30,034
but I can pretty much do anything I want
in this situation.

90
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,870
Who do you think will win
if this goes to court?

91
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,790
And how will you run the pub
during the trials?

92
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,252
You knocked down a wall
and made structural alterations.

93
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:42,297
I could ask you
to restore the space as well.

94
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,216
But those petty details...

95
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,845
I don't care.

96
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:54,517
Then what do you want?

97
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:57,937
My son, Geun-soo.

98
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,898
Why are you letting him work there?

99
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,527
-We were short-staffed.
-Let him go.

100
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:07,363
That's up to him to decide.

101
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,157
Does having my son to work for you

102
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:12,327
help you boost your self-esteem?

103
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,291
Sir.

104
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,503
I suppose you use your employees
to boost your self-esteem.

105
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,883
He said you're a strong person.

106
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,764
Therefore, I plan to take this opportunity

107
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,683
to teach my son

108
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,936
what it really means to be strong.

109
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,444
You bought the building
to show off your power?

110
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,032
That's not all.

111
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,701
I know how persistent you can be.

112
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,205
Even after you get kicked out,
you'll open up a pub somewhere else.

113
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,414
Am I right?

114
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,295
Then I'll buy that building as well.

115
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,843
I'm going to buy every building
that you rent out.

116
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,393
Is that

117
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,312
your definition of power?

118
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:27,193
I can easily control and have influence
over all your achievements.

119
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,406
Isn't that power?

120
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:39,706
Seeing you today

121
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:42,709
reminds me when we first met.

122
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:46,003
You got expelled
because you were too stubborn

123
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,547
to get on your knees.

124
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:53,761
Haven't you had enough?

125
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,307
Park Saeroyi.

126
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,520
What would I get for ruining your life?

127
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,405
What do you want me to do?

128
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:18,828
You started off on the wrong foot,
so let's fix that first.

129
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:22,331
Get on your knees and apologize.

130
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,088
If I get on my knees, will you allow me

131
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,718
-to continue my business?
-Of course.

132
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,678
Haven't you learned?

133
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:39,557
You can't get what you want
by being emotional.

134
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,268
If you kneel and sincerely apologize,

135
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,521
I'll put the past behind us.

136
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,817
And I'll no longer try
to take anything from you.

137
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,324
Money.

138
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,035
You think money is what I want?

139
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:02,747
There's too much involved between us

140
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:04,999
to think of it so lightly.

141
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:11,130
What I want out of this fight isn't money.

142
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:12,715
Because

143
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,343
I am

144
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:17,595
your enemy.

145
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:26,729
The day I got expelled
for refusing to get on my knees,

146
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:32,985
my dad told me
that he's proud to have me as a son.

147
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,115
Getting expelled? Getting kicked out?

148
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,202
You took

149
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,747
absolutely nothing from me.

150
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,924
In my opinion, power comes from people.

151
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,636
Because their trust gives me strength.

152
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:03,307
So Geun-soo told you
that I'm a strong person?

153
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,602
I'm glad to hear that.

154
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:09,689
I'll become

155
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,441
even stronger.

156
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,948
If your business fails,

157
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,409
you'll lose your people.

158
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,078
They're the reason why
I can continue to run my business.

159
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:27,373
Is that so?

160
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:33,421
So you want to keep going?

161
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,383
Yes.

162
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,271
That was your last chance.

163
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:56,027
You'll regret this.

164
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,496
You want to stop
this ill-fated relationship?

165
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,626
There's one way to stop.
Do you want to know what it is?

166
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,841
Get punished
for all that you've done wrong

167
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,844
and get on your knees.

168
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:55,753
Saeroyi.

169
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,968
Right. You work here during the day.

170
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,762
Yes. What about you?

171
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,430
What brings you here?

172
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:12,103
I met Chairman Jang.

173
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:15,940
We'll have to move out.

174
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,363
It's no big deal. Don't be so serious.

175
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,117
Are you okay?

176
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:32,623
I'm just upset that my plan

177
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,917
to make you quit
is going to take longer than expected.

178
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,296
You're such a fool.

179
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:43,259
Ms. Oh, the documents are ready.

180
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:44,969
It's time.

181
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,473
You should go.
I'll see you later at Itaewon.

182
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,601
Okay, I'll see you.

183
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,837
<i>He bought the building?</i>

184
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,715
I didn't know the old man
would be so aggressive.

185
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:24,467
Exactly.

186
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,680
What's going to happen
now that he can't run the pub?

187
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:32,850
The best choice is to receive a premium
before the lease is over.

188
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,852
The Saeroyi I know

189
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,854
will quickly find
another place for his pub.

190
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:40,900
How about asking him
to focus on my business instead?

191
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,819
A small business takes time to grow.

192
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,448
I was actually
planning to talk to him about that.

193
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:51,368
Is he doing okay?
He must be pretty discouraged right now.

194
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,330
He's fighting against Chairman Jang.

195
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:56,832
Deep down inside,
he's probably pretty upset.

196
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,542
But don't worry.

197
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,587
<i>I've known Saeroyi for ten years,</i>

198
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,131
<i>and during all the ups and downs,</i>

199
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,176
<i>I've never once seen him discouraged.</i>

200
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,513
<i>Yi-seo!</i>

201
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:16,185
You stormed out yesterday,
but you came to work early.

202
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,105
I don't want to talk to anyone
from the Jang family.

203
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,648
So will you stop talking to me?

204
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:34,745
Then just tell me.

205
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,081
I know it's because of Saeroyi.

206
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,793
Tell me what my family did to him.

207
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,422
Okay, fine.

208
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,760
You didn't know anything,
so you probably felt at ease.

209
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:52,638
What?

210
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:58,018
Do you really want to know
what your family did

211
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,104
to our boss?

212
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:10,990
Hey, you're here.

213
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,036
Hey, you're our manager.
You can't just storm out like that.

214
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,621
Our boss was really worried.

215
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,457
What?

216
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:27,006
Why would you be worried?
I'm not a little kid.

217
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,719
I thought I'd be the first to come,
but you're all here already.

218
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,139
Hey, Geun-soo.

219
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,224
So what you're going to do?

220
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,232
Let's eat first.

221
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:54,992
What do you need?

222
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,287
I heard you decided to buy

223
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,164
the building where DanBam
is doing business.

224
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:01,916
And?

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,252
May I ask you why?

226
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,254
Don't you know already?

227
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,134
I think I already know
what you're going to say.

228
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,512
But I'm not in a very good mood.

229
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:17,973
So choose your words wisely.

230
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,479
It was very unlike you.

231
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,153
It was unlike me?

232
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:34,031
Yes.

233
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,285
This may sound out of line,

234
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,163
but I've known you for over ten years.

235
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,999
You've made choices that sometimes

236
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,335
went against the social custom.

237
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,586
I clearly told you

238
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,589
that I'm not in a good mood.

239
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,094
Are you telling me that I was wrong
to kick him out like that?

240
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,971
You?

241
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,849
But even if those choices were wrong,

242
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,686
all those choices were made

243
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:06,480
to benefit the company.

244
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,443
But the purchase of the building
seemed like a very emotional decision.

245
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,237
-And that's not something--
-Enough.

246
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,575
That's enough.

247
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,665
You may leave.

248
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,945
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

249
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,033
<i>What I want out of this fight isn't money.</i>

250
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,076
Because

251
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,454
I am

252
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,706
your enemy.

253
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:09,710
Do I really think

254
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,921
of that little kid

255
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,759
as my enemy?

256
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:23,878
Do you know what he said to me?

257
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:26,589
"My life has just begun!

258
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:27,799
And I'll do

259
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:30,676
everything I want to do."

260
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:33,471
That's what he said to me.

261
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:34,847
I'm so impressed.

262
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:37,558
Will you stop telling that story?
I've heard it enough.

263
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:39,352
Just have some beef jerky.

264
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,607
Why do you guys look so down?
Did you fight?

265
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:46,692
No.

266
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:49,487
It's no big deal.
Those two fight all the time.

267
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,030
Let's go for a second round.

268
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:52,573
Where should we go?

269
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:56,452
I'm not that interested,
but how about we go to a club?

270
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:01,457
A club? Sounds great. Let's go.

271
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,961
You must've had a lot of fun
the first time you went clubbing.

272
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:07,797
You think I had fun?
After I saw you that night...

273
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,091
-What?
-Let's just drop it.

274
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,803
What is it? Don't you want to go?

275
00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:18,349
No, it's not that.
I was just wondering if it's fun there.

276
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,143
-I've never been.
-Yes, it's fun.

277
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:22,478
Okay.

278
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:27,233
-There we go.
-What are you doing?

279
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:28,901
Just watch.

280
00:21:32,864 --> 00:21:36,117
Get up. Let me teach you
how to have fun at a club.

281
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,410
-Here?
-Yes.

282
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:40,830
First, you need to smile.

283
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:42,665
-Smile?
-Yes, smile.

284
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:48,337
Okay, that's good.
The next step is to show your presence.

285
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:52,633
-Okay.
-Step three is to get close.

286
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:54,927
-Sit back down.
-Sorry.

287
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:14,322
When you go clubbing in Korea,

288
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:17,992
it's best not to hit on too many women.

289
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,286
Then what should I do?

290
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:22,788
Your first choice is very important, okay?

291
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:26,292
"Is he hitting on me
after getting rejected by her?"

292
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,170
You don't want a woman to think that way.

293
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:32,632
What's going on? Tell me.

294
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:36,427
-It's nothing.
-You're so petty.

295
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:39,096
Are you still upset
because of what Yi-seo said yesterday?

296
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,812
You guys can go first.
I want to have a word with Geun-soo.

297
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,981
Okay, we'll see you there.

298
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:50,816
-Okay.
-Let's go.

299
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:00,284
Let's go.

300
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,085
What's wrong?

301
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:12,046
Is it because of Yi-seo?

302
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,841
-I heard everything.
-Heard what?

303
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:19,095
I heard

304
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:22,807
what my family did to you.

305
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,021
Why didn't you tell me?

306
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:33,192
Because it's between me

307
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:36,487
and your brother and father.

308
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,198
It has nothing to do with you.

309
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:44,954
I knew

310
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:48,874
you would think like that.

311
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:53,504
Because that's your principle.

312
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:59,301
Why did you offer to work

313
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:01,595
at DanBam?

314
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:05,224
I told you.

315
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:08,102
I wanted to make money.

316
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,605
To be honest,

317
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:14,108
it looked like

318
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:16,902
you needed

319
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:21,198
someone to lean on.

320
00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:27,913
This might sound out of line.

321
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,751
And it might sound funny.

322
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:34,003
But I thought DanBam

323
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:36,297
and I might be able

324
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:41,135
to give you something to lean on.

325
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:45,014
Thank you.

326
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,434
-But I don't need you to pity--
-I'm not pitying you.

327
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,269
You just reminded me of

328
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:55,191
myself.

329
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,822
I wanted to get along with you well.

330
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:05,451
But I didn't think of how you would feel

331
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:09,580
after you found out everything.

332
00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:12,875
I'm sorry.

333
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:14,960
No.

334
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:18,839
No, you don't need to do that.

335
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,841
You don't need

336
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:23,552
to apologize.

337
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:28,140
Geun-soo.

338
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:35,064
I'm really sorry
for what my family has done

339
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:39,819
to you.

340
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:52,164
They will

341
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,668
get punished no matter what.

342
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:33,247
-What do you think? Isn't it great?
-It looks so fun.

343
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,416
-Haven't you been to a club in Korea?
-No, I haven't.

344
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:36,834
You're pretty new yourself.

345
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:38,669
I'm a professional clubber.

346
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,633
Here.

347
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:49,305
Oh, right. My ID. Just a second.

348
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,806
You don't need to show me.

349
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,226
Look at yourself.
You're obviously old enough.

350
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,061
Okay.

351
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:57,804
Stop.

352
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,765
-Where are you from?
-What?

353
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:04,528
-I'm...
-Why are you asking him that?

354
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:07,072
People from Africa
and the Middle East can't enter.

355
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:10,409
Come on. This is Itaewon.
Don't be like that.

356
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:11,619
You're embarrassing us.

357
00:27:11,702 --> 00:27:13,579
I'm just following the rules.

358
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:16,457
Where are you from?

359
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,834
I'm Korean.

360
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:22,004
Show me your passport.

361
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:25,925
But I'm Korean.

362
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,344
My dad is Korean.

363
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:31,388
Hey, we have a bugger.
Send someone to the entrance.

364
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:36,393
Why would you call him that
when he's right there?

365
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:38,062
Hey, don't explode.

366
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:42,316
Just leave while I'm being nice.

367
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,362
-And what if I refuse?
-Forget it.

368
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,906
They don't accept Africans.
Let's go somewhere else.

369
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:52,493
But I told you that my dad is Korean.

370
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:54,536
Let's go already.

371
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,040
I'm also Korean, okay?

372
00:27:58,165 --> 00:28:00,459
How are you Korean?

373
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,795
-You have dark skin.
-Hey.

374
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:04,505
You...

375
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:08,509
You're so mean!

376
00:28:09,093 --> 00:28:10,135
-Toni!
-Hey!

377
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:12,596
Toni, where are you going?

378
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,847
Toni!

379
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:16,141
My gosh.

380
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:21,814
-What's with him?
-They wouldn't let him in.

381
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:23,649
What? Why?

382
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:25,484
They don't accept Africans.

383
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:28,779
That's up to the owner.

384
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,031
He kept saying he's Korean.

385
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:32,825
He got upset
because I didn't take his side.

386
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:35,286
Hey, will you stop being so mean?

387
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:39,498
You've been getting on my nerves
since yesterday.

388
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:40,416
What?

389
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:43,085
He's obviously not Korean.

390
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,878
Yi-seo, that's enough.

391
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:46,714
Boss, you should stop too.

392
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:55,180
BOGWANG KOSIWON
BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

393
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:56,390
DANBAM PUB

394
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:57,725
YOU'RE SO PRETTY

395
00:29:00,144 --> 00:29:03,272
DON'T GET HURT,
AND LET'S MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

396
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:16,410
What am I going to do?

397
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:47,024
YOU RACIST

398
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:48,942
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY

399
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:50,694
YOU HUMILIATE KOREA

400
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:52,571
EAT SHIT

401
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,785
What the...

402
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:02,998
-What's on your jacket?
-What?

403
00:30:06,043 --> 00:30:07,836
It's nothing.

404
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:12,049
What's your plan for the pub?

405
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,967
We'll have to move out.

406
00:30:24,853 --> 00:30:26,271
-What's this?
-It's a decent firm.

407
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:27,606
You'll make money if you invest.

408
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,277
I don't have money to invest.

409
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:39,284
Why don't you just shut down the business?

410
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:42,871
It doesn't earn much money
compared to the investment.

411
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:43,997
And it's too risky.

412
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:46,667
And it'll be riskier
if Jangga Co. gets in the way.

413
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,085
This is an important period.

414
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:50,546
You should spend your energy
on receiving Ms. Kang's support.

415
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,965
But you need to move
and get ready to reopen.

416
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:54,716
It'll be too inefficient.

417
00:30:57,553 --> 00:30:58,679
No.

418
00:31:01,098 --> 00:31:03,016
If you invest your premium,
you'll make about--

419
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,309
I'm not going to invest.

420
00:31:07,813 --> 00:31:08,814
What about Chairman Jang?

421
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:11,650
He warned that he'll buy
every building that you rent out.

422
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:13,026
You need to be realistic.

423
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,696
If he keeps targeting you,
your business will never succeed.

424
00:31:19,283 --> 00:31:20,701
There's one way.

425
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:23,120
What's that?

426
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,592
I'm going to call Ms. Kang
and ask her to meet today.

427
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:41,805
No way.

428
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:46,685
I'm sorry.

429
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:09,374
DANBAM

430
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:28,852
You're here early.
You work too hard these days.

431
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:29,978
Hey, you guys.

432
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:45,994
Yi-seo.

433
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:47,871
What?

434
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:49,748
Can we talk?

435
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:52,292
DANBAM

436
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,296
What is it?

437
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:03,428
It's better to stay here

438
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,848
than to move to a new spot, right?

439
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:09,434
Why do you ask the obvious?

440
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,938
I plan

441
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:15,774
to quit working at Danbam.

442
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:24,449
That's what you wanted to say?

443
00:33:26,243 --> 00:33:28,036
In return for going back home,

444
00:33:29,037 --> 00:33:30,247
I'm going to ask my dad

445
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:33,041
to leave Saeroyi alone.

446
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:37,504
That would

447
00:33:39,423 --> 00:33:40,549
be the best choice, right?

448
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:56,273
Will you please do that?

449
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,904
I'd be really grateful.

450
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:10,996
My gosh.

451
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:17,294
You really are mean.

452
00:34:28,472 --> 00:34:29,848
After you dance with her a bit more

453
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:33,560
and give her a few compliments...

454
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:37,147
Aren't you thirsty?

455
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:40,233
I have a table over there
Do you want to drink with me?

456
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:42,861
That's all you need to say to her.

457
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:46,573
Then the night will be yours.

458
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:49,242
-Gosh, that's nuts.
-I'm so excited.

459
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:50,285
What?

460
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:06,885
-Hello?
-<i>Aren't you cold?</i>

461
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:08,762
<i>Why do you look so sentimental?</i>

462
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:24,069
I wanted to talk to you.

463
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:25,654
About what?

464
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:29,282
Chairman Jang bought the building
that I rented out.

465
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:33,328
Ho-jin already told me.
Do you need to borrow money?

466
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:34,955
No.

467
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:41,169
I'd like to withdraw one billion won
of my stocks in Jangga Co.

468
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:45,757
Then you won't have any influence
in the company.

469
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:48,510
I'm sorry.

470
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:55,684
This is completely different
from what Ho-jin had planned.

471
00:35:56,977 --> 00:35:58,979
I thought you'd drop the pub
and focus on helping me.

472
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:06,278
It's not even a franchise
or a famous brand. Do you really need

473
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:09,156
to risk everything on that small pub?

474
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,367
It's precious to me.

475
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:16,538
Yes, but Chairman Jang easily took
that precious pub away from you.

476
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:17,873
The pub is all about

477
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,668
the people I work with.

478
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:42,147
So Toni didn't show up.

479
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:44,191
He's not even answering my calls.

480
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,611
Hey.

481
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,490
Why don't you apologize to Toni?

482
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:54,367
-Why would I?
-I knew you'd be like this.

483
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:58,538
Soo-ah, why are you carrying the beer?

484
00:36:58,622 --> 00:36:59,664
Let me take them for you.

485
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:07,130
I made myself clear
that I hate you the other day.

486
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:08,924
But you keep showing up.

487
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:10,050
Where's Saeroyi?

488
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,802
You're here.

489
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:14,596
Hey, Soo-ah. You're here again.

490
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,431
I came to return the beer
I borrowed before.

491
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:18,058
Do you not want me to be here?

492
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:22,771
What? No one's here.

493
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,440
We had some customers earlier.
They just left.

494
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:26,775
I see.

495
00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:29,194
Boss.

496
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:30,570
Yes?

497
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:32,364
Geun-soo has something to tell you.

498
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:45,502
DANBAM

499
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:51,132
What do you want to tell me?

500
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:56,596
Well...

501
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:03,562
I want to quit.

502
00:38:04,563 --> 00:38:06,898
Why are you being like this?

503
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:17,576
What's the reason?

504
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:19,744
Nothing.

505
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:22,998
I just think it'd be better this way.

506
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,668
If the reason you're quitting

507
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:28,587
has something to do

508
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,590
with your father or brother,

509
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:34,801
can't you just stay?

510
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:37,846
I like you.
You're like my younger brother.

511
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,772
Geun-soo says he will talk to his dad

512
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:49,774
on condition that he quits his job here.

513
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:54,946
He will talk to his dad?
What does that mean?

514
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,073
So we can keep our business running here.

515
00:38:57,157 --> 00:39:00,785
Even if we get the premium,
we will still have to find a new place

516
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:02,495
and pay brokerage
and interior design fees.

517
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,164
It costs hundreds of millions of won.

518
00:39:04,247 --> 00:39:07,208
The best option is to stay here.

519
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,794
And we can do that with Geun-soo gone.

520
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:20,555
What do you think?

521
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,974
Of course I agree with it.

522
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:25,644
Geun-soo must've felt
uncomfortable working here.

523
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:28,021
You should understand how Geun-soo--

524
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,109
JO YI-SEO

525
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,169
What are you doing?

526
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,421
You don't deserve

527
00:39:55,048 --> 00:39:56,633
to be the manager here.

528
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,346
But...

529
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,014
Saeroyi, wait.

530
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:04,349
This is my business.

531
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:08,770
Sympathy.

532
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:11,940
It's sympathy again.

533
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:13,608
It's...

534
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:15,902
It's just sympathy.

535
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:18,613
How long will you let
sympathy stand in your way?

536
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:20,865
You're always at the mercy of everyone.

537
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:23,493
Franchise? Leadership
in the foodservice industry?

538
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:25,120
How are you going to make it happen?

539
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:28,081
Forget about Jangga Co.

540
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:31,292
If you run your business like this,
you're no match for Jangga Co.

541
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:33,086
So you don't want to lose anyone.

542
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:35,380
Because DanBam is like a family.

543
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:39,300
Will you please wake up to the reality?

544
00:40:40,135 --> 00:40:43,763
If you just fire a part-timer,
it'll all be over.

545
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:48,143
How much money do you want to lose
before you pull yourself together?

546
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:03,116
Business is all about profit--

547
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,325
For me...

548
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:13,001
If that's what business is all about,
I won't do it.

549
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:14,794
Boss, please...

550
00:41:14,878 --> 00:41:17,297
If I were to become like him,
I wouldn't have started this.

551
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,132
Look what we are going through now.

552
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:21,468
We're about to get kicked out.

553
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:24,888
I just

554
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:29,309
don't want you to suffer a loss.

555
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:33,980
So what if we get kicked out

556
00:41:34,814 --> 00:41:36,399
and it costs hundreds of millions of won?

557
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:38,318
Jangga Co. is my enemy.

558
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:41,071
It's only natural
that my enemy attacks me.

559
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:42,781
It was bound to happen anyway.
No big deal.

560
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:44,532
What makes me upset now

561
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:48,578
is you whom I thought was on my side.

562
00:41:49,996 --> 00:41:52,707
I just said that for your sake.

563
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,001
-I was concerned about...
-Why?

564
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:58,505
Why do you have to fire

565
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:02,300
someone I care about for my sake?

566
00:42:21,528 --> 00:42:22,529
I'm sorry.

567
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:26,574
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

568
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:30,370
I should go get some fresh air.

569
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:35,375
I get what you are saying.

570
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:38,002
But I'm the manager here.

571
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:40,421
No matter how idealistic you're being,

572
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:42,924
we will eventually get kicked out of here.

573
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:46,761
And we can't be sure
the same thing won't happen again.

574
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:53,309
I bet my life on you.

575
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:55,520
You have to take responsibility.

576
00:42:56,771 --> 00:42:58,773
I need a realistic alternative.

577
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,904
<i>You're an idealist.</i>

578
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:09,993
That old man keeps his words
no matter what.

579
00:43:10,076 --> 00:43:13,037
Even if you move to another place
with your precious employees,

580
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:14,956
the same thing will happen again someday

581
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,875
unless you have a realistic alternative.

582
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:18,877
That's the reason
I'm retrieving the investment.

583
00:43:22,463 --> 00:43:24,340
To protect my people.

584
00:43:24,757 --> 00:43:27,886
I won't be swayed
by Chairman Jang anymore.

585
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:35,602
You have no alternative.

586
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:40,148
I'll buy a building.

587
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:50,366
What are you talking about?

588
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,536
The realistic alternative.

589
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:06,466
It's a lie.

590
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:08,676
You know him.

591
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,180
Saeroyi never lies.

592
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:20,939
Can I talk to you for a moment?

593
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:43,336
JO YI-SEO

594
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:52,637
What do you want?

595
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:56,391
I want to give you some help.

596
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,935
Did you not hear
what my boss said earlier?

597
00:44:59,018 --> 00:45:01,646
This is our business. Stay out of it.

598
00:45:02,897 --> 00:45:04,065
No.

599
00:45:04,774 --> 00:45:06,401
I mean about Saeroyi.

600
00:45:09,988 --> 00:45:13,116
You work at DanBam
because you like him, right?

601
00:45:13,783 --> 00:45:14,701
So?

602
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,164
If Saeroyi was a sly guy
who pursues practical interest,

603
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,749
would you still have liked him?

604
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:25,253
What's your point?

605
00:45:28,006 --> 00:45:29,340
You know about

606
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:31,092
Saeroyi's past.

607
00:45:33,094 --> 00:45:36,472
It counts only when he proves himself
in the opposite way

608
00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:39,058
of what Chairman Jang has done.

609
00:45:41,436 --> 00:45:42,603
And as you know,

610
00:45:44,022 --> 00:45:46,065
it's a very hard thing to do.

611
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:48,693
For him

612
00:45:50,987 --> 00:45:52,822
and for those who have to watch him do so.

613
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:57,744
But Saeroyi won't change.

614
00:45:57,994 --> 00:46:00,580
I mean, no one can change him.

615
00:46:02,665 --> 00:46:04,250
He's very strong.

616
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:09,380
If you really want to be on his side,

617
00:46:09,464 --> 00:46:11,716
don't try to change him.

618
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:14,218
You should be ready to walk with him.

619
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,721
You should understand him.

620
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:22,894
So I guess you understand him very well.

621
00:46:22,977 --> 00:46:24,771
Not really.

622
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:28,441
That's why I'm not on his side.

623
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:41,871
I should get going.

624
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:45,792
Why are you telling me all that?

625
00:46:48,836 --> 00:46:49,712
Well...

626
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:51,422
I don't know.

627
00:46:54,717 --> 00:46:56,135
I didn't feel like working.

628
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:00,181
Did you give up on him then?

629
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,600
No.

630
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:05,812
Because I'm confident.

631
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:07,188
I told you.

632
00:47:08,564 --> 00:47:10,233
Saeroyi likes me.

633
00:47:13,027 --> 00:47:14,320
You know what?

634
00:47:15,488 --> 00:47:18,116
I really hate you.

635
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:19,617
Well...

636
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,285
I know that too.

637
00:47:23,663 --> 00:47:26,207
Keep your chin up, Cutie.

638
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:43,015
<i>If Saeroyi was a sly guy
who pursues practical interest,</i>

639
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:44,308
<i>would you still have liked him?</i>

640
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:46,102
Just this once?

641
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:50,106
Just this once? Once and for all?
But there will be another time.

642
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:53,985
It will make things easy this once.

643
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:55,778
But you know what?

644
00:47:56,654 --> 00:47:58,156
Those one times

645
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:00,741
might change your whole life.

646
00:48:01,742 --> 00:48:04,620
Thank you for everything until now.

647
00:48:04,704 --> 00:48:05,872
It's twice your pay.

648
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:09,709
If you like working here,

649
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:12,253
I want you to work twice as hard.

650
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:14,547
Can you do that?

651
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,889
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

652
00:48:22,972 --> 00:48:25,099
YOU RACIST
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY

653
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:28,728
Can't you do it right?

654
00:48:29,729 --> 00:48:31,731
He's really strange.

655
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:36,485
It's strange,

656
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:40,072
but I like him.

657
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:09,810
Jang Geun-soo.

658
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:11,187
Oh...

659
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:12,647
Yi-seo.

660
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:21,739
I'm sorry.

661
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:26,786
You must be mad at me.

662
00:49:29,288 --> 00:49:32,250
What can I do to make it up to you?

663
00:49:37,505 --> 00:49:38,631
I'm not mad.

664
00:49:44,512 --> 00:49:45,596
Yes, you are.

665
00:49:46,305 --> 00:49:47,598
You have every reason to be mad.

666
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:49,350
I was heartless.

667
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:51,269
We've been friends for quite long.

668
00:49:51,852 --> 00:49:53,104
You were always heartless.

669
00:49:54,689 --> 00:49:56,774
You are also inconsiderate

670
00:49:57,358 --> 00:49:58,734
and selfish.

671
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:03,781
I guess you were hurt a lot.

672
00:50:09,912 --> 00:50:11,289
But I like you

673
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:16,210
the way you are.

674
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,304
I was being ambiguous before.

675
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:29,807
I think I should make myself clear.

676
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,602
I love our Boss like crazy.

677
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:38,566
I'm trying to be nice to you
when you're just a headache

678
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:42,194
because I want to stay by his side.

679
00:50:44,947 --> 00:50:46,032
So

680
00:50:47,325 --> 00:50:48,826
don't stand in my way.

681
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:51,662
I should go.

682
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,434
YONGSAN-GU OFFICE

683
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:14,852
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

684
00:51:15,478 --> 00:51:16,604
How many times must I say it?

685
00:51:16,687 --> 00:51:19,732
I can't retrieve personal information
without his consent.

686
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:22,651
He's not a stranger. He's my dad.

687
00:51:22,735 --> 00:51:24,528
Take a look at this.

688
00:51:25,946 --> 00:51:28,407
You can't prove the paternity
only with a picture.

689
00:51:28,991 --> 00:51:31,285
You should bring
the family relation certificate.

690
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:32,703
Then I'll look into it for you.

691
00:51:38,584 --> 00:51:41,462
<i>I went to a club in Itaewon
with the employees of DanBam last night,</i>

692
00:51:41,545 --> 00:51:43,005
<i>but we were denied admission</i>

693
00:51:43,089 --> 00:51:45,049
<i>just because one of our employees,</i>

694
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:47,176
<i>Toni was from Africa.</i>

695
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,220
<i>I can't believe there's racism
in this day and age.</i>

696
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:51,222
-This is crazy.
-<i>Itaewon is an international town.</i>

697
00:51:51,305 --> 00:51:54,392
<i>I resent all those racists.</i>

698
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:57,520
<i>This is embarrassing.
It's a disgrace to our country.</i>

699
00:51:57,603 --> 00:51:58,938
<i>I can't believe it still happens.</i>

700
00:51:59,021 --> 00:52:00,773
<i>It's just skin color.</i>

701
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:02,733
You're here.

702
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,568
Hey.

703
00:52:04,652 --> 00:52:07,571
Hey, did you do this?

704
00:52:07,655 --> 00:52:08,864
Do what?

705
00:52:10,074 --> 00:52:11,325
Well...

706
00:52:12,368 --> 00:52:13,661
I did.

707
00:52:17,456 --> 00:52:19,500
You said messing with your people

708
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,211
is just like messing with you.

709
00:52:22,294 --> 00:52:23,629
So I made up my mind.

710
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:27,883
I will just kill those who mess with you.

711
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:30,761
Hey, Yi-seo. You sound so cool.

712
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:36,100
Where's Toni? Is he here yet?

713
00:52:36,684 --> 00:52:38,936
Will you try calling him?

714
00:52:43,691 --> 00:52:45,025
What? Hey.

715
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,070
-Well...
-Toni.

716
00:52:54,535 --> 00:52:56,495
I WENT TO A CLUB IN ITAEWON

717
00:52:58,956 --> 00:53:00,374
I'm Korean.

718
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:03,669
You know what?

719
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:06,088
You don't look Korean.

720
00:53:06,172 --> 00:53:07,590
Why do you call yourself Korean?

721
00:53:07,673 --> 00:53:09,175
What is she doing?

722
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,970
My dad is Korean.

723
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:16,140
My dad came to Korea to meet my grandma.

724
00:53:16,223 --> 00:53:18,225
And I came to Korea to find my dad.

725
00:53:19,226 --> 00:53:20,561
Once I find him,

726
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:23,063
I can acquire Korean nationality.

727
00:53:27,902 --> 00:53:29,195
I'm Korean.

728
00:53:29,278 --> 00:53:33,073
But the fact is that you didn't
acquire Korean nationality yet.

729
00:53:33,657 --> 00:53:35,743
It means you're not Korean.

730
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,372
-Yi-seo.
-I'll

731
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,834
help you find your dad.

732
00:53:47,463 --> 00:53:48,422
Yi-seo.

733
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,509
I'll do anything to help you.

734
00:53:55,888 --> 00:53:56,889
I'm sorry

735
00:53:58,265 --> 00:53:59,767
that I didn't take your side.

736
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:09,902
I have a stomachache.

737
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:11,820
I need to go to the restroom.

738
00:54:14,156 --> 00:54:15,407
Gosh.

739
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:19,245
It feels so warm.

740
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:22,706
Spray painting was so childish.

741
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:24,833
You should use your brains.

742
00:54:33,676 --> 00:54:34,635
Gosh.

743
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:35,844
Wait.

744
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:40,182
Give me back my name tag.

745
00:54:49,316 --> 00:54:50,234
This?

746
00:54:56,407 --> 00:54:57,741
Put it on me.

747
00:55:17,428 --> 00:55:20,973
It's really hard
to deal with people like you.

748
00:55:22,308 --> 00:55:24,143
But I'll try to understand.

749
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:29,732
Thank you.

750
00:55:35,362 --> 00:55:37,364
Yi-seo, you're all grown up.

751
00:55:46,999 --> 00:55:49,668
This is the last one
about Jiin Department Store.

752
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:50,836
Okay.

753
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:53,213
And

754
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:57,343
a new tenant has moved
into the building where DanBam was.

755
00:55:59,887 --> 00:56:01,639
He must've had no choice but to move out.

756
00:56:01,722 --> 00:56:03,932
We have to nip it in the bud.

757
00:56:05,643 --> 00:56:07,353
You should buy the building
he moved in too.

758
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,897
Do you know where he moved to?

759
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:11,774
Well...

760
00:56:13,525 --> 00:56:15,402
He bought a building at Gyunglidan-road.

761
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:25,663
What?

762
00:56:31,669 --> 00:56:35,798
DANBAM

763
00:56:41,428 --> 00:56:42,554
Please take a look.

764
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:44,848
Here?

765
00:56:46,433 --> 00:56:48,686
-A little more to the left.
-Here?.

766
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:50,479
-I think it's done.
-Left?

767
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:55,943
All right.

768
00:56:57,528 --> 00:57:00,239
Cool. You're a man of your word.

769
00:57:00,322 --> 00:57:02,992
-We still have a long way to go.
-She's right.

770
00:57:03,075 --> 00:57:05,244
Hello. We opened a new pub here.

771
00:57:07,955 --> 00:57:09,289
Did you move in here?

772
00:57:09,373 --> 00:57:11,542
Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you.

773
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,127
Why did you buy this building?

774
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,337
You are no good judge of buildings.

775
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:17,172
Why?

776
00:57:17,464 --> 00:57:19,633
All the businesses here
have gone bust every year.

777
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:21,635
My gosh.

778
00:57:23,012 --> 00:57:25,514
Call me if you need anything.

779
00:57:25,597 --> 00:57:27,307
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh, dear.

780
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:33,355
DAILY INSTALLMENT LOAN

781
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:35,691
What did she say?

782
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,860
All the businesses here have failed.

783
00:57:43,782 --> 00:57:44,992
<i>The pub is all about</i>

784
00:57:45,617 --> 00:57:46,910
<i>the people I work with.</i>

785
00:57:46,994 --> 00:57:48,412
People.

786
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:51,290
I told you. Business is all about people.

787
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,544
It's not like we're a charity.
This is business.

788
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,296
We need to make a profit.

789
00:57:57,379 --> 00:57:58,881
We should see it at large.

790
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:01,425
Who would trust a company
that's inconsistent?

791
00:58:01,508 --> 00:58:05,220
It's all over once we lose
the confidence of people.

792
00:58:09,308 --> 00:58:11,351
Like father, like son.

793
00:58:21,487 --> 00:58:23,322
<i>He retrieved the investment</i>

794
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:26,283
<i>and bought a building?</i>

795
00:58:36,627 --> 00:58:38,712
I was going to visit you to apologize.

796
00:58:38,796 --> 00:58:40,589
I'm surprised you came all the way here.

797
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:41,965
Apologize?

798
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:44,510
About the investment I retrieved.

799
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:47,638
I caused trouble to your schedule.

800
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:49,723
I told you before.

801
00:58:49,807 --> 00:58:51,266
One percent. Two billion won.

802
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:53,310
They are just numbers.

803
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:58,273
The mission I gave you was
to make Chairman Jang go to your pub.

804
00:58:58,357 --> 00:58:59,316
It wasn't the money.

805
00:59:03,237 --> 00:59:05,572
Do you still want me on your side?

806
00:59:06,573 --> 00:59:07,783
Of course.

807
00:59:09,785 --> 00:59:11,787
Chairman Jang and Jang Geun-won.

808
00:59:12,746 --> 00:59:15,124
Your goal is to get back at them, right?

809
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:19,920
We should have the same goal
to plan something together.

810
00:59:20,796 --> 00:59:23,298
Are you sure revenge is all you want?

811
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:25,425
Revenge.

812
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:30,389
Maybe after that.

813
00:59:33,725 --> 00:59:35,102
What I want

814
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:37,646
is freedom.

815
00:59:38,605 --> 00:59:39,731
Freedom?

816
00:59:42,484 --> 00:59:46,280
I want my words and acts to have power

817
00:59:46,572 --> 00:59:49,700
so no one can mess with me and my people.

818
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:55,164
I don't want to be swayed
by anyone or any injustice.

819
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,543
I want to live a life

820
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:02,421
where I make my own decisions

821
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:06,008
and I don't have to pay for my principles.

822
01:00:07,885 --> 01:00:09,011
Gosh.

823
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:13,932
It's just an ambiguous pun of an idealist.

824
01:00:18,729 --> 01:00:19,813
I like it though.

825
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,277
The freedom you talked about...

826
01:00:27,404 --> 01:00:29,156
Let's enjoy it together.

827
01:00:32,868 --> 01:00:33,869
Okay.

828
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:58,644
The power and people he talked about...

829
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,606
<i>You took</i>

830
01:01:03,732 --> 01:01:06,360
absolutely nothing from me.

831
01:01:08,737 --> 01:01:11,198
I couldn't take anything from him?

832
01:01:14,493 --> 01:01:15,327
What?

833
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:19,831
As I grow older,

834
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,043
I'm becoming pettier.

835
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:28,840
A building owner?

836
01:01:29,925 --> 01:01:32,719
In the end, you keep moving forward.

837
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:35,305
I'm not even surprised.

838
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:39,351
We should wait and see.

839
01:01:39,434 --> 01:01:41,812
I heard businesses at that spot
has failed every year.

840
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:44,439
You don't seem worried though.

841
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:47,442
Well...

842
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:50,821
Because I have my people.

843
01:01:51,405 --> 01:01:52,739
I keep on going believing in them.

844
01:01:58,203 --> 01:02:00,956
I'm jealous.

845
01:02:02,874 --> 01:02:03,750
What?

846
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,837
Jealous of what?

847
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,716
You seem to care about them a lot.

848
01:02:13,969 --> 01:02:16,805
-That's because--
-You really need her, right?

849
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:22,936
I mean, Yi-seo.

850
01:02:25,731 --> 01:02:27,065
On your way

851
01:02:28,066 --> 01:02:29,651
to make me unemployed.

852
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:32,863
You need her, right?

853
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:46,752
<i>Chairman Jang,
the guest you're expecting is here.</i>

854
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:48,587
Okay. Let her in.

855
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,131
Are you expecting someone?

856
01:03:10,442 --> 01:03:12,152
<i>It hasn't been a long time since she came,</i>

857
01:03:13,403 --> 01:03:15,280
but I can't imagine

858
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:18,867
DanBam without Yi-seo.

859
01:03:49,981 --> 01:03:52,567
