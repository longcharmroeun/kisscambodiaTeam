Saeroyi!

00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,659
Is this 911? Someone got hit by a car.

7
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:10,620
Can you track the location? Hurry.
Come as soon as possible!

00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:31,641
Hey, Geun-soo.

12
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:35,186
Come on, guys. Get him.

13
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,439
Hello?

14
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:41,609
Seung-kwon! Yi-seo has been kidnapped.

15
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:44,154
And Saeroyi is hurt. Can you--

16
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,114
Shut up, you little shit.

17
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:51,828
Geun-soo.

18
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:03,173
Take him.

19
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,291
I feel like I've seen this before.

20
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,093
Try to understand, brother.

21
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,306
Business is business.

22
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:55,767
Go check.

23
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,185
-Yes, boss.
-Yes, boss.

24
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,441
Damn it. Let's go.

25
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,710
-Give us the rundown.
-Age 34.

26
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,713
He's a TA victim. His vitals are good,
but he's unconscious.

27
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,507
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

28
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,050
Be careful.

29
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:31,678
Let's go.

30
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,522
-You must wait here.
-What's going on?

31
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,649
-You cannot come in.
-Let go. I said, let go!

32
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:47,694
-You cannot enter.
-Saeroyi!

33
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,784
Sir, can you talk?

34
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:56,786
Sir.

00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:08,006
<i>Last night, Park Saeroyi,

00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,364
Mr. Oh.

42
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,909
Did something happen?

EPISODE 15

44
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,045
Where's Yi-seo?

45
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:49,422
Not sure. I can't reach her.

46
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:51,841
I don't know where she is.

47
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,431
-Where have you been?
-I had to take care of something.

48
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:02,810
-Mr. Oh, can I talk to you for a minute?
-What?

49
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,104
-Me?
-Yes.

50
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:18,952
What? She was kidnapped?

51
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,122
I checked the CCTV footage.

52
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,542
-I'm sure of it.
-Who are these bastards--

53
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,127
They kidnapped her from this hospital.

54
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:31,547
Anyway, this is Saeroyi's phone.

55
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,217
DON'T CALL ANYONE AND COME ALONE

56
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,718
Does this mean

57
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:38,429
the hit-and-run was also...

58
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,307
We'll find out.

59
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:44,018
I have to go somewhere.

60
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,312
Please stay by Saeroyi's side.

61
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:49,983
Hey, where are you going?
We should report this to the police first.

62
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,819
You read the text. "Come alone."

63
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,241
I bet they took Yi-seo and Geun-soo
and threatened Saeroyi.

64
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:00,159
-We can't involve the cops.
-Then what?

65
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:02,120
What will you do all by yourself?

66
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,720
I want to check something.

67
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:20,805
I think I know who did this.

68
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:24,892
<i>A hit-and-run?</i>

69
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:35,236
-Park Saeroyi?
-Yes, sir.

70
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,905
He was taken to the hospital last night.

71
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:40,616
He's unconscious at the moment.

72
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:44,579
Bring Geun-soo to me.

73
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,707
Mr. Jang Geun-soo

74
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:50,960
didn't come to work today.

75
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,422
We can't even get a hold of him
at the moment, sir.

76
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:57,425
What?

77
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,895
"Park Saeroyi,
the CEO of restaurant company IC Co.

78
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:12,231
was injured in a hit-and-run accident,

79
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,650
which took place
near a reservoir in Pajin City.

80
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,653
He was transported
to the hospital right away,

81
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,781
but he..."

82
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:25,328
He died!

83
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,712
That's my wishful thinking. Unfortunately,

84
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:38,508
he's just in critical condition.

85
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,134
Jang Geun-won.

86
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,679
I'm your brother.

87
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:46,766
I'm your big brother, you prick.

88
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,231
You got what you wanted,

89
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,943
-so let Yi-seo go.
-What are you talking about?

90
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,782
Do you know what my last mission was
when I was at Jangga Co.?

91
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,285
"Bring Jo Yi-seo to Jangga Co."

92
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,041
I had to waste four years behind bars

93
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,628
because of that damn recording.

94
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:19,966
No.

95
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,970
You ended up in that mess because of Dad.

96
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,098
Because Dad deserted you.

97
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,521
He chose Jangga Co.

98
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,149
over his son.

99
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,777
-Shut up.
-You crazy bastard.

100
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:46,409
You can't make Jangga Co. yours
by doing this.

101
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:54,709
Do you think I did all this just to make
the company mine? I'm not a moron.

102
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:58,462
Park Saeroyi.

103
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,427
Park Saeroyi is still alive.

104
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,654
This little bitch here is the key.

105
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:24,822
Jang Geun-won!

106
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,828
Both Saeroyi and you

107
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,540
ran here to save this bitch,

108
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:36,375
so I'm obviously on the right track here,

109
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,419
aren't I?

110
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:45,551
What did she say?

111
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:51,474
"I love Park Saeroyi like crazy"?

112
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:01,525
He's on the brink of death
because he came to save you.

113
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,653
How do you feel?

114
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,488
Jang Geun-won.

115
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,699
You bastard.

116
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:22,838
Gosh, I feel better
now that I've seen that face.

117
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,642
This isn't something you can cover up.

118
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,811
How will you deal with the consequences?

119
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,530
If I had worried about the consequences,

120
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:49,782
you two would already be dead.

121
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,746
You crazy freaks.

122
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:12,388
That psycho.

123
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:24,817
Hey.

124
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,070
Are you all right?

125
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:31,490
His goal is to torment me,
so I just have to act like I'm suffering.

126
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,160
He tied you up so well,

127
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,121
but not me. It's so obvious.

128
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:53,804
I need to stop by the office.

129
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,474
When will you pay me the rest?

130
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:58,476
"The rest"?

131
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,312
Come on. The job's not done yet.

132
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:05,900
Enough is enough, okay?

133
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,237
Saeroyi and I are on bad terms now,
but I've known him for ten years.

134
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,158
I did everything you asked me to do,
so don't give me that bullshit.

135
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,660
Ten years?

136
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,719
Hey.

137
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:35,846
What's so funny?

138
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,602
Then why did you hit him with the van?

139
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:48,192
Obviously because a billion won
matters more to you than those ten years.

140
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:51,570
Then just work like a dog.

141
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:54,698
Don't even try to act like you're human.

142
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,790
Watch your words.

143
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,044
What are you going to do if I lose it?

144
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:12,091
If you don't need the money,
you can do whatever you want.

145
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:20,599
You said you have to go.

146
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,005
You need to see this, sir.
Things are getting out of hand.

147
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,842
Jang Geun-won, that psycho,
is being reckless.

148
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,011
It worries me, sir.

149
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:59,346
Why don't we just call it quits now?

150
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,058
Boss!

151
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:06,562
Hee-hoon, are you there?

152
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,689
Hee-hoon!

153
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,234
Gosh, how long has it been?

154
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,695
Hey, how have you been?

155
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,198
Where's Big Boss? Is he inside?

156
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,408
He's not here at the moment.
Come back another time.

157
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,035
Really?

158
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:25,247
I want to see him because
it's been a while. Can I wait inside?

159
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,249
Sorry, but you can't.

160
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,254
I told you that he's not here now.

161
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,716
-What?
-Just leave.

162
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,551
Don't cause trouble, please.

163
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:41,722
Okay, I should leave if he's not here.

164
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:44,600
But you.

165
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,437
What's with that tone?

166
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,672
Why do you look all dazed and confused?

167
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,921
Come on. You're all grown up now.
Don't be such a baby.

168
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,258
Why are you being like this?

169
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,982
I missed you.

170
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,696
You saw me in the morning.

171
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,657
Did something happen at school?

172
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:30,998
Well...

173
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,836
Maybe I'm just a little tired.

174
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,516
Boss, I know you're in there.
It's me, Seung-kwon.

175
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,601
Hey!

176
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:55,898
Let me in, boss.
Your little brother is here to see you!

177
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,275
-Jeez.
-Hey.

178
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:00,527
We told you that he's not here.

179
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:03,072
What the hell are you doing
in front of our office?

180
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:08,118
Boss, I have something to ask you.
Let me in!

181
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,286
You little fucker.

182
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,831
Just leave, okay?

183
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:20,923
Did you just kick me?

184
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,468
The situation has changed, you know.

185
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,555
Right.

186
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:31,141
And I've changed quite a bit too.

187
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:32,267
What will you do?

188
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,813
-Do you want to fight?
-Hello? This is the police, right?

189
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,732
I'm at Minkang Building
in Donggyo-dong now.

190
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:42,861
Some gangsters are trying to beat me up.
I'm so scared. Please hurry.

191
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:52,746
That hurt. Easy, okay?

192
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,250
-My gosh.
-What a freak.

193
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,420
Right? Hey, what are you going to do?

194
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,547
What do you think?

195
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,883
I guess the cops will be here soon.

196
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:06,969
I think...

197
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,267
the fucker that hurt Saeroyi is here.

198
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:17,229
That's why I came here,
but you guys assaulted me!

199
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,364
What do you think will happen
if I say that to the cops?

200
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:30,659
Who'd believe

201
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:32,953
an ex-con?

202
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,372
<i>So?</i>

203
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,332
Is your life over?

204
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,628
-What?
-You think your life is worth nothing.

205
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:44,047
Moron.

206
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,345
You guys think
your lives are worth nothing.

207
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,347
You morons.

208
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:57,686
Like you said, the situation has changed.

209
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,063
The cops will totally believe me

210
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,610
because I'm now...

211
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:10,282
CHOI SEUNG-KWON, DIRECTOR

212
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,702
...the director of IC Co.

213
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,297
Don't you dare think
that you can determine my worth.

214
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:32,679
Wake up.

215
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:34,598
Please?

216
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:37,559
Why are you sleeping for so long?

217
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,566
Hey, where are you?

218
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,611
-<i>I'm at the police station.</i>
-What? Why?

219
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,155
<i>Hey, is Soo-ah there by any chance?</i>

220
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,574
Yes. She's here, but...

221
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,718
Have you made many new friends?

222
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,556
Yes.

223
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,394
You remember Soo-ah, right?
We're still good friends.

224
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:24,356
I met a guy named Ho-jin,
and we get along very well.

225
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,192
And I've gotten close
to my younger friends too.

226
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,155
I'm surprised. It sounds like
you have a lot of friends now.

227
00:20:34,616 --> 00:20:35,617
Right?

228
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,079
Who are the younger friends?

229
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:43,750
Seung-kwon and Hyun-yi.

230
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,461
There's a guy named Toni as well.

231
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,713
And...

232
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,108
And?

233
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,240
Anyway, I have many friends now.
Let's drink.

234
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,868
Can you drink pretty well now?

235
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:19,912
You said I should learn drinking from you.

236
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:29,212
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM 1

237
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:37,429
Seung-kwon.

238
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:40,974
I can go now, right?

239
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:43,435
Yes, we'll be in touch.

240
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:44,853
Take care, Officer.

241
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:46,521
Hey, wait.

242
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,775
What happened to your face?

243
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,152
What the heck happened?

244
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:54,404
Nothing serious.

245
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:59,201
Officer, what happened?

246
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,746
Well...

247
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,756
You got assaulted? Unilaterally?

248
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:13,966
Are you an idiot?

249
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,302
What do you want me to do, then?
You told me to quit the bad habit.

250
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,805
I never told you to just get beaten up.

251
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:21,556
Jeez.

252
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:24,893
I told you to just send Soo-ah.
Why did you tag along?

253
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:36,238
Wait here.

254
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,366
Where are you going?

255
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,005
Where are they?

256
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,091
What the hell are you talking about?

257
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,762
This country is such a safe place.
There are CCTV cameras everywhere.

258
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,307
I checked the CCTV footage
from the hospital.

259
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:06,268
Those bastards that took Yi-seo...

260
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,104
They're in there now.

261
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,025
Why didn't you tell the cops all about it?

262
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:20,157
I guess you're worried something bad
might happen to those kids.

263
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,617
But you know what?

264
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:27,247
You've got the wrong person.

265
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,544
From what I remember,

266
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:36,548
we were never bullies.

267
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:47,392
I'm mad about what happened to Saeroyi,
but I'm trying my best to hold my anger.

268
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,771
Just remember this one thing.

269
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,315
Yi-seo and Geun-soo.

270
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,610
If they get hurt or don't come back,

271
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,654
you'll be totally screwed.

272
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:03,825
I, Choi Seung-kwon,

273
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:07,162
will give up on living a decent life.

274
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:30,727
Let's go.

275
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,021
We need to finish the job.

276
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,856
Yes, sir.

277
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:49,371
What's going on? Who is he?

278
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,039
What was that about?

279
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:56,294
Soo-ah.

280
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:11,977
<i>How is he?</i>

281
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,979
I heard

282
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,731
he's still unconscious.

283
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:23,989
It was all Geun-won's doing.

284
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:32,164
Geun-soo and Jo Yi-seo of IC Co.
have gone missing.

285
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,999
And Saeroyi's hit-and-run accident.

286
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:36,877
Can all of it be a coincidence?

287
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:42,048
Even if Geun-won is a complete idiot...

288
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,135
Kidnapping and attempted murder?

289
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:48,263
No way.

290
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,434
He doesn't have the guts
to do such a thing.

291
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:57,522
The hit-and-run accident

292
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,691
fifteen years ago

293
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:02,861
and the press conference

294
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,822
you held four years ago

295
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:11,119
turned him into someone
who's capable of doing such things.

296
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:14,706
Are you saying

297
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:21,713
I got this from the director of IC Co.

298
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,478
The people who kidnapped
Jo Yi-seo and Geun-soo.

299
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,812
HOON HOLDINGS

300
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,357
Those images are from the CCTV footage
from their office.

301
00:26:46,947 --> 00:26:48,073
You turned

302
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,369
Geun-won into such a monster.

303
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:53,828
-Ms. Oh.
-Sir.

304
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,080
Enough!

305
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,685
Yes.

306
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:21,231
You may be right.

307
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,405
We should be ready.

308
00:27:30,907 --> 00:27:31,908
"Be ready"?

309
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:35,870
I can't let the company's reputation
get any worse than this.

310
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,124
I should do what I can
to deal with the situation

311
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:41,960
and cover it up.

312
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:46,965
"Deal with the situation"?

313
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:51,094
I guess this is how

314
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,764
you dealt with the accident

315
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,018
that occurred 15 years ago.

316
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,198
You're really something.

317
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:38,791
What do you plan to do?

318
00:28:40,459 --> 00:28:42,461
Even if you untie me,
we won't be able to escape.

319
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:44,547
So what?

320
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:47,216
Should we just give up

321
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,844
and die here?

322
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:55,391
You idiot.

323
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:59,103
This is why you can't ever beat our boss.

324
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:05,693
You went to Jangga Co. acting like
you were determined to do something great.

325
00:29:06,402 --> 00:29:08,487
But whenever things got difficult,
you played dirty.

326
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:11,991
And look where you are now.

327
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,869
I really hate you.

328
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:21,000
I didn't go to Jangga Co.
because I wanted to.

329
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:24,128
You don't know what I've been through--

330
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:25,296
You just

331
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:28,924
ended up

332
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:31,135
losing yourself.

333
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:33,679
No.

334
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:39,602
Not everyone can be like Saeroyi.

335
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:45,983
You're wrong.

336
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:52,740
RESIGNATION LETTER

337
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,329
You told me

338
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:01,165
that you despise people
who have no backbone

339
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,709
and are easy to control.

340
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,174
For the first time in my life,

341
00:30:11,884 --> 00:30:13,510
I'm choosing what I want to do.

342
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:27,650
I accept your resignation.

343
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:29,568
You may leave.

344
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:38,535
And this has

345
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:41,664
all the irregularities of Jangga Co.

346
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:43,582
which I've gathered
for the past ten years.

347
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,299
Borrowed-name stocks,
slush funds, illegal requests, bribery--

348
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,177
-How dare you--
-There's a limit

349
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,013
to what you can do to people

350
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:01,475
with power and fear.

351
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:05,145
-Ms. Oh.
-You should not

352
00:31:07,022 --> 00:31:09,858
try to cover this up.

353
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:17,533
You'll have to make sure

354
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:19,827
the situation doesn't get worse.

355
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:29,753
Get out

356
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:33,007
right now.

357
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:13,172
<i>You should go to university.</i>

358
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:15,424
You can succeed

359
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:17,760
and pay me back twofold.

360
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,645
<i>I'll succeed</i>

361
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:32,483
<i>and pay you back three times the amount.</i>

362

RESIGNATION LETTER

363
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,943
You think it’s hard
to stick to your principles

364
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:20,406
and be honest about
what you like and dislike,

365
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,449
don’t you?

366
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:27,121
You're just giving excuses

367
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:30,082
so you can feel comfortable with yourself.

368
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:38,882
That doesn't sound very convincing
coming from you.

369
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:42,010
I know.

370
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,473
Our boss

371
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:48,851
really is amazing.

372
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,565
Saeroyi

373
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,610
got hit by a car while trying to save me.

374
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,696
If...

375
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:03,490
If something bad happens to him--

376
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,575
Shut up.

377
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:08,996
He'll overcome it.

378
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,793
He has never once

379
00:34:17,212 --> 00:34:18,630
disappointed me.

380
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:36,732
Where are we going?

381
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,334
A place

382
00:34:57,377 --> 00:34:59,630
where you'll no longer have
painful nights.

383
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:12,559
We're almost there.

384
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:16,897
We just need to cross this bridge.

385
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:27,074
<i>THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA</i>

386
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:33,413
This is nice.

387
00:35:34,706 --> 00:35:36,124
What's nice?

388
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:40,212
Before, I didn't want to be born again

389
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:44,383
even if reincarnation really existed.

390
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:51,181
What do you mean?

391
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:56,937
Living is a difficult thing to do.

392
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:09,157
I bet

393
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:12,077
you had a tough time.

394
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,421
Yes.

395
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:25,549
It was tough.

396
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:31,054
"I can do this.

397
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,808
Everything will be fine."

398
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:39,354
I kept telling myself that
and tried really hard.

399
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:45,027
But the truth is,

400
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:52,743
my life

401
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,417
always felt so burdensome.

402
00:37:09,718 --> 00:37:11,345
I missed you...

403
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:16,350
And living my life

404
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:19,936
based on hatred

405
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:25,025
was really difficult.

406
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:37,204
Can I hug you?

407
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,667
What?

408
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,226
If I get the chance to be born again,

409
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,021
I want to be born as your son.

410
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:06,983
My goodness.

411
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,822
You keep acting like a little kid.

412
00:38:15,617 --> 00:38:16,702
I love you

413
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:21,039
so much.

414
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,378
Yes.

415
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:29,339
I love you, too.

416
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,432
<i>Life is so tough.</i>

417
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:41,393
But now that I met you,

418
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:44,271
I finally understand

419
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:46,606
what this part really means.

420
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:50,902
"WAS THAT LIFE? WELL THEN! ONCE MORE!"

421
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:11,882
Dad.

422
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:17,763
Have a peaceful trip.

423
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,433
What?

424
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:26,521
I'm not going with you.

425
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:32,569
Saeroyi.

426
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,822
<i>"Was that life?</i>

427
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,826
Well then!

428
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:42,037
Once more!"

429
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:48,668
I have a date.

430
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:56,092
Son.

431
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:01,389
I'm sorry.

432
00:40:07,145 --> 00:40:08,271
I don't mind

433
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:12,359
having to spend
all those endless nights again.

434
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,280
Actually,

435
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,825
my nights

436
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:24,746
aren't that painful anymore.

437
00:40:31,503 --> 00:40:34,756
I have friends who need me.

438
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:42,764
And I'm curious about what kind of future
we'll be spending together.

439
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:46,977
I look forward to it.

440
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,190
They give me joy.

441
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,088
I know

442
00:41:17,215 --> 00:41:18,633
you're no longer with me.

443
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:25,223
But I'm going to

444
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:27,142
embrace

445
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:30,395
my yearning heart.

446
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,358
And I'll continue to live my life.

447
00:41:48,788 --> 00:41:50,540
You finally got it, Saeroyi.

448
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,503
That's what life is.

449
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:02,135
You can overcome anything

450
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:05,263
as long as you're alive.

451
00:42:06,473 --> 00:42:07,807
I really mean it.

452
00:42:41,383 --> 00:42:42,592
I am

453
00:42:46,471 --> 00:42:48,598
so proud of you, my son.

454
00:43:02,404 --> 00:43:03,738
Keep on

455
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:05,824
living

456
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:12,372
this way,

457
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:16,292
my son.

458
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,551
Saeroyi.

459
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:53,723
Are you okay?

460
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,768
Can you hear me?

461
00:44:57,393 --> 00:44:58,394
Hey.

462
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:03,233
Are you okay?

463
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:49,571
<i>And just like that,
Saeroyi continued to cry</i>

464
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,948
<i>for a pretty long time.</i>

465
00:45:54,242 --> 00:45:56,244
<i>It was my first time seeing him cry.</i>

466
00:45:58,371 --> 00:45:59,455
<i>And I</i>

467
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:01,791
<i>had no idea what those tears</i>

468
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:04,711
<i>really meant.</i>

469
00:46:07,505 --> 00:46:08,965
<i>I had no clue.</i>

470
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,011
<i>But for some reason,</i>

471
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,435
<i>I felt relieved.</i>

472
00:46:48,296 --> 00:46:49,297
<i>Dad.</i>

473
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,095
It's me, Geun-won.

474
00:46:57,847 --> 00:46:59,349
Don't tell me you are now--

475
00:46:59,432 --> 00:47:00,350
That's right.

476
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:03,603
Jo Yi-seo and Geun-soo.

477
00:47:04,896 --> 00:47:06,064
I'm holding them hostage.

478
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:10,235
How dare you--

479
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:12,028
<i>Don't worry about Geun-soo though.</i>

480
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:17,575
You value Jangga Co.
over even your own life.

481
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:21,204
And he's your successor.

482
00:47:23,164 --> 00:47:24,415
I won't hurt him.

483
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:29,629
Are you in your right mind?

484
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:30,922
Not really.

485
00:47:32,298 --> 00:47:33,967
How would I be in my right mind?

486
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:36,344
Where are you now?

487
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:39,931
I can't take care of things
without knowing where you are.

488
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:46,688
You know what, Dad?

489
00:47:48,356 --> 00:47:49,440
I wanted

490
00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:55,905
to be a proud son to you.

491
00:48:02,787 --> 00:48:04,831
When do you think
things started to go wrong?

492
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:10,920
The day I first met Park Saeroyi?

493
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,758
<i>Or the day I caused
the hit-and-run accident?</i>

494
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:19,512
That day...

495
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,432
Saeroyi

496
00:48:24,183 --> 00:48:25,226
is just livestock.

497
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:35,862
Do you remember the day
when I twisted that chicken's neck?

498
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,661
I managed to put up with the whole thing
thanks to that day.

499
00:48:46,956 --> 00:48:48,791
"Park Saeroyi is a livestock.

500
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,630
<i>I don't have to feel guilty
when I eat chicken or pork."</i>

501
00:48:57,008 --> 00:48:58,343
Only then

502
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:01,888
I could hold out.

503
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:06,142
But the thing is

504
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:15,360
I've always been scared.

505
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,113
-Geun-won--
-<i>But...</i>

506
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,958
But I'm not like that anymore.

507
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:37,340
Now I understand what you've said.

508
00:49:38,216 --> 00:49:39,717
I owe it all to you.

509
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:43,221
What?

510
00:49:43,304 --> 00:49:45,348
I'm sick and tired of everything.

511
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,061
He's just a brute.

512
00:49:50,895 --> 00:49:53,398
But he made you abandon your own son.

513
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:55,775
Park Saeroyi.

514
00:49:59,612 --> 00:50:01,155
I will put an end to everything.

515
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:04,700
To him and even to myself.

516
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:08,579
Geun-won. You--

517
00:50:08,663 --> 00:50:11,124
<i>I'm in the deserted warehouse
in Pajin now.</i>

518
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:13,167
I told you.

519
00:50:13,876 --> 00:50:16,295
I owe it all to you.

520
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:19,090
So...

521
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:26,097
you are the only person who can stop me.

522
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:30,435
It's up to you.

523
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:35,189
<i>If you want to stop me,</i>

524
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,316
<i>like you did before,</i>

525
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:42,530
you can just abandon me again.

526
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:46,033
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

527
00:50:46,117 --> 00:50:48,494
Geun-won. Geun-won!

528
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:20,276
You don't have much time left here, Dad.

529
00:51:23,112 --> 00:51:25,198
So I'd like to get you a little present.

530
00:51:49,931 --> 00:51:51,724
Done. Let's go.

531
00:51:56,771 --> 00:51:58,606
What are you doing? We have to go.

532
00:51:59,815 --> 00:52:00,816
If I do this now,

533
00:52:01,526 --> 00:52:03,402
I will be able to plead self-defense.

534
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:04,862
What?

535
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,241
If Geun-won stays alive,

536
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:10,326
he will...

537
00:52:13,037 --> 00:52:15,248
-He will harm Boss again.
-Damn it!

538
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:21,170
What if you kill someone just to help him?

539
00:52:21,754 --> 00:52:23,506
Do you think he will be happy?

540
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,050
Please. Let's just go.

541
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:37,562
Stop.

542
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:39,146
Stop right there.

543
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:40,815
Stop.

544
00:52:41,232 --> 00:52:42,525
Stay there!

545
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:45,486
Damn it!

546
00:52:49,907 --> 00:52:51,242
Wait, Saeroyi.

547
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:57,540
You almost got killed.

548
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:01,794
-Calm yourself down and--
-I have to go.

549
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:05,172
Where?

550
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:08,342
What can you do in this condition?

551
00:53:09,468 --> 00:53:11,012
You should call the police instead.

552
00:53:11,095 --> 00:53:12,972
It will put Yi-seo in danger.

553
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,269
What Geun-won wants is me.

554
00:53:20,938 --> 00:53:23,232
If you go there,
what difference does it make?

555
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,277
You're just going there to die.

556
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:29,947
Soo-ah.

557
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:33,784
Please.

558
00:53:35,411 --> 00:53:36,537
I'm begging you.

559
00:53:42,877 --> 00:53:45,713
What if something happens to you?
Then I'll just--

560
00:53:45,796 --> 00:53:47,214
You asked me before.

561
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,013
If I like Yi-seo.

562
00:54:01,437 --> 00:54:02,563
I do.

563
00:54:15,743 --> 00:54:17,078
You're such a fool.

564
00:54:18,287 --> 00:54:19,622
Everyone knew it

565
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:22,708
except you.

566
00:54:34,303 --> 00:54:35,554
Still, you can't go.

567
00:54:37,765 --> 00:54:40,351
-You can't.
-Am I going there to die?

568
00:54:41,936 --> 00:54:43,062
No.

569
00:54:44,563 --> 00:54:46,148
I'm going there to survive.

570
00:54:52,655 --> 00:54:53,656
I'm afraid.

571
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:58,828
If something happens to Yi-seo,

572
00:55:00,371 --> 00:55:02,289
Then I will really be destroyed.

573
00:55:12,717 --> 00:55:14,552
Saeroyi, please.

574
00:55:16,178 --> 00:55:17,179
I should go.

575
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:39,326
Are you all right?

576
00:55:41,495 --> 00:55:42,496
This way.

577
00:55:47,668 --> 00:55:48,669
Can you run?

578
00:55:54,216 --> 00:55:56,218
Stop right there, you idiots!

579
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:57,595
You go first.

580
00:56:08,397 --> 00:56:10,691
You're really about to die.

581
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,402
Let me take care of it and stay in bed.

582
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,654
You know,

583
00:56:16,947 --> 00:56:18,949
going to Jang Geun-won now

584
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:20,701
will be very dangerous.

585
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:23,120
What?

586
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:26,624
Still, I need you to come with me.

587
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:30,127
My gosh.

588
00:56:35,508 --> 00:56:39,136
MY FATHER KNOWS WHERE I AM
JANG GEUN-WON

589
00:56:41,138 --> 00:56:42,264
We should hurry.

590
00:56:44,308 --> 00:56:45,434
Where?

591
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:03,285
Damn it.

592
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:10,000
Damn it.

593
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,253
I've been waiting for you.

594
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:14,713
I'm not a fraud.

595
00:57:14,797 --> 00:57:16,924
Like you said, I get paid for my job.

596
00:57:17,508 --> 00:57:18,843
I should wrap things up.

597
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:31,647
Forget about Park Saeroyi.

598
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,942
I want you to die, Jo Yi-seo.

599
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,473
Park Saeroyi.

600
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:12,521
Where's Jang Geun-won?

601
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:17,318
How dare you barge in at this late hour.

602
00:58:18,569 --> 00:58:20,237
What crap are you talking about?

603
00:58:21,238 --> 00:58:22,281
Geun-won

604
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:26,744
kidnapped Yi-seo.

605
00:58:31,081 --> 00:58:32,249
Did you know that?

606
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:36,754
Who said my son

607
00:58:37,755 --> 00:58:39,089
did such a thing?

608
00:58:39,173 --> 00:58:40,466
I talked to him on the phone.

609
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,096
And he texted me
that you know where he is now.

610
00:58:52,645 --> 00:58:55,606
If you pretend not to know about it,

611
00:58:56,815 --> 00:58:58,567
it will go to the police.

612
00:59:04,281 --> 00:59:05,741
You'd want to keep Jangga Co. safe.

613
00:59:12,623 --> 00:59:14,291
Where's Geun-won?

614
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,589
<i>I set up Jangga Co.</i>

615
00:59:22,299 --> 00:59:24,510
<i>so my whole family can live in clover</i>

616
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:29,306
<i>without starving like I did.</i>

617
00:59:30,391 --> 00:59:32,059
<i>It's all about Jangga Co.</i>

618
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:35,145
I wonder what it is for.

619
00:59:37,648 --> 00:59:38,983
<i>What's the point</i>

620
00:59:41,402 --> 00:59:43,028
<i>of my life?</i>

621
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,408
When do you think
things started to go wrong?

622
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,328
<i>Come to think of it...</i>

623
00:59:58,419 --> 00:59:59,545
This is all

624
01:00:00,671 --> 01:00:01,922
because of you.

625
01:00:05,217 --> 01:00:06,802
Where is he?

626
01:00:10,514 --> 01:00:12,182
<i>It's been over a decade.</i>

627
01:00:14,768 --> 01:00:17,354
<i>Ten years is an epoch.</i>

628
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:20,816
<i>But you jerk</i>

629
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:23,902
<i>haven't changed.</i>

630
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,590
I made up my mind some time ago.

631
01:00:45,924 --> 01:00:47,134
But it turned out

632
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:51,972
to be the hardest thing to do.

633
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:55,601
Chairman Jang.

634
01:01:01,398 --> 01:01:02,399
Will you

635
01:01:04,068 --> 01:01:05,861
kneel before me?

636
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,624
What is that old bastard talking about?

637
01:01:18,957 --> 01:01:21,710
Your son is holding someone hostage.

638
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:24,421
Damn it.

639
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:37,059
<i>There are things that are impossible.</i>

640
01:01:39,394 --> 01:01:42,106
<i>Something above death.</i>

641
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,400
I want you to kneel before my son
and apologize

642
01:01:45,984 --> 01:01:46,985
for what you did.

643
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:51,073
I can't apologize to Geun-won.

644
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:53,659
Because

645
01:01:54,952 --> 01:01:56,537
I don't feel sorry at all.

646
01:01:56,787 --> 01:01:57,746
<i>If you self-reflect</i>

647
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,415
and apologize to my son on your knees...

648
01:02:11,009 --> 01:02:12,511
Your son is the one

649
01:02:15,139 --> 01:02:16,473
who should get on his knees.

650
01:02:22,813 --> 01:02:25,524
<i>Kneeling before Chairman Jang Dae-hee</i>

651
01:02:27,568 --> 01:02:28,652
<i>is one.</i>

652
01:02:37,578 --> 01:02:38,620
<i>But...</i>

653
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:06,732
<i>Right</i>

654
01:03:13,906 --> 01:03:15,073
<i>at this moment</i>

655
01:03:39,097 --> 01:03:41,934
<i>I'm willing to do it thousands of times.</i>

656
01:03:46,438 --> 01:03:47,522
Saeroyi.

657
01:04:03,288 --> 01:04:04,498
<i>There's nothing</i>

658
01:04:18,512 --> 01:04:19,680
<i>easier than this.</i>

659
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,771
SPECIAL THANKS TO SON HYUN-JOO

660
01:04:30,899 --> 01:04:33,652
"WAS THAT LIFE? WELL THEN! ONCE MORE!"
