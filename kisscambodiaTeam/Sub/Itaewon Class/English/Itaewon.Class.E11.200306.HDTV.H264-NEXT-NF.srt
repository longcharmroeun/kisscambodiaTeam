EPISODE 11

6
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:19,279
The Best Pub?

7
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:25,118
The business is doing pretty well
these days,

8
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:27,120
so I'm not sure if there's a point.

9
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:28,372
Should I talk to them?

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,458
Yes, so...

11
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:34,670
We don't have to pay
to be on the show, right?

12
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:36,463
Okay.

13
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:40,634
Then I'll discuss with my staff
and get back to you.

14
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,177
All right.

15
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:44,763
<i>The Best Pub</i>?

16
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:46,640
They want us on the show again?

17
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:50,352
Goodness. They refused to put us on,
but now they want us back?

18
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,188
We generated quite the buzz
thanks to Jangga Co.

19
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:55,691
The victim of a big company's power abuse
overcame a hardship

20
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:57,943
-and opened his own business.
-Hey.

21
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:03,031
What? It's an inspiring story.

22
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:06,410
And everyone loves
success stories like this.

23
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:10,998
We've received a number of inquiries
regarding using the name, DanBam.

24
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,252
-When is Hyun-yi back from her vacation?
-In a week.

25
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:18,130
Then it'll work out, time-wise.

26
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:21,425
What do you guys all think
about going on the show?

27
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:25,387
Well, I have no reason to object to it.

28
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,847
I'm on board.

29
00:01:33,353 --> 00:01:34,563
Me too.

30
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,773
I think it'll be beneficial for DanBam.

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,113
Then...

32
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,615
Also,

33
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:47,784
I have something to tell you.

34
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:50,913
Okay, what is it?

35
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,416
I will

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,585
leave DanBam.

37
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,718
Hey, what the heck are you talking about?

38
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:10,057
I've been thinking about it for a while--

39
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,100
Let's go upstairs and have a chat.

40
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:25,113
I'm curious.

41
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:30,327
You've been holding out well
even though you don't really belong here.

42
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:33,497
Why do you want to quit now?

43
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:40,837
Because of you.

44
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:03,944
I've mentioned this before,
but if it's because of your family--

45
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:05,362
No, it's not.

46
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,949
That's not the reason.

47
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:11,493
Then what is it?

48
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:15,664
I'm not sure if you know this,

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,208
but I was born out of wedlock.

50
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:20,335
What about it?

51
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,839
There are things I always used to hear

52
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:26,341
because of it.

53
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:28,260
"Don't be greedy.

54
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,179
Know your place.

55
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,306
Mooch off the Jangga Co."

56
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:36,476
So I kept that in mind

57
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:39,896
and never wanted anything in life.

58
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:47,237
That's how I used to live,

59
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:50,532
but you're...

60
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,870
Your "way of life," shall I say?

61
00:03:58,707 --> 00:03:59,875
It was very stimulating.

62
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:04,838
I must've learned something here.

63
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:07,382
I think I've changed a little.

64
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,510
No.

65
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:13,597
<i>If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,</i>

66
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,143
you should take over Jangga Co.

67
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:23,899
I'm going to change.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,451
I'm not sure what the reason is,

69
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:36,453
but I can't ask you to stay.

70
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,751
I wish you all the best.

71
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:50,175
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

72
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:08,568
Look who's here.

73
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,362
What's up, Soo-ah?

74
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:16,618
How are you?

75
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,662
Are you all right?

76
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:22,791
I won't be here long anyway.

77
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,002
I'll get out soon. Don't worry.

78
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:31,883
Thanks for visiting me.
This makes me feel better.

79
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:34,344
I appreciate it.

80
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:38,306
The chairman

81
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,309
sent me here.

82
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:46,857
My dad?

83
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:50,777
He's doing well, right?

84
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:53,780
Right, I'm the sole heir of the company.

85
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,907
He can't be at ease,
knowing that I'm locked up here.

86
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,411
Tell him not to worry.

87
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:02,455
Let him know I'm doing well here.

88
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:14,134
JANGGA CO.

89
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,477
It's an agreement

90
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:27,355
for share transfer.

91
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:30,358
What?

92
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:34,362
The chairman

93
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:38,408
wants you to transfer your shares

94
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:42,787
to himself.

95
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,365
Sir, I just heard that all went well
with the share transfer.

96
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,576
Good.

97
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:23,203
Dad.

98
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:31,503
You...

99
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:33,630
What are you doing here?

100
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,430
I think I should start learning

101
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:44,849
about management.

102
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,853
-What?
-I'm talking about Jangga Co.

103
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:51,648
I should

104
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:54,192
run the company down the road.

105
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,285
-What are you--
-You dedicated your life to Jangga Co.

106
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:10,208
Can you really leave it in the hands
of a complete stranger?

107
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,130
You don't have

108
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,215
an alternative.

109
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:28,727
CHOI SEUNG-KWON

110
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,645
I have to say, that was too heartless.

111
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,315
Shouldn't we have thrown
a goodbye party for him?

112
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:36,735
I know. I feel like it was too rushed.

113
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:38,403
With Geun-soo gone,

114
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:40,864
this place feels empty.

115
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:42,866
Why did he quit?

116
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:45,910
What do you think?
It's obviously because of someone we know.

117
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,374
Hello, welcome to...

118
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:57,714
What?

119
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:00,467
Hold on.

120
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:04,304
Pretty lady, what's with all this makeup?

121
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,807
The surgery went well.

122
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:11,686
I'm back at work tomorrow, you know.
I'm stopping by to let you know

123
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:13,480
that I'm back safe and sound.

124
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,192
-You look pretty.
-I know, right?

125
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,361
I can't believe
you look prettier than I do.

126
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:21,279
My gosh.

127
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:23,490
You totally surprised us.
Right, Seung-kwon?

128
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:25,033
Yes. What? What did you say?

129
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:31,498
You heard the news, right?

130
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:35,085
Yes. About Geun-soo
and <i>The Best Pub</i>, right?

131
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:37,587
Sounds like a lot happened
while I was gone.

132
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:40,507
Let's spend some time with Geun-soo soon.

133
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:43,301
What do you want to do?
About <i>The Best Pub</i>.

134
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:47,639
Why even ask?
It's a good opportunity for us.

135
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:49,766
We should do it.

136
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:54,020
I knew it. Great minds think alike.

137
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:01,027
JANGGA CO.

138
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,779
This is good enough.

139
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:06,699
You don't have to manage the pub anymore.

140
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:08,326
Pardon?

141
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,538
-Then--
-I don't need you in Itaewon anymore.

142
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,331
Focus on the planning team.

143
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,793
Yes, sir.

144
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:20,380
The project Geun-won was in charge of...
The TV show...

145
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,925
<i>The Best Pub</i>, right?

146
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:25,468
I want you to be in charge of it.

147
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:29,305
And do me a favor.

148
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,266
What is it, sir?

149
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,936
Come in.

150
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:47,991
Hello. I'm Jang Geun-soo, Ms. Oh.

151
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:51,911
What brings you here?

152
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:54,372
You two have met before, right?

153
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,251
He's my younger son.

154
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,920
I want you to train him.

155
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:07,177
I'm looking forward to working with you,
Ms. Oh.

156
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,017
Don't mind us. This is your desk.

157
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:20,899
And this is the planning team's manual.

158
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,402
It's very thick.

159
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:27,238
You need to be multifaceted
to work in Planning.

160
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:29,365
This has all the basic information.

161
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:31,242
Okay.

162
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,787
By the way,

163
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:38,708
why did you leave DanBam?

164
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:42,795
There's something I want.

165
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:44,756
I guess I've gotten greedy.

166
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:47,300
"Greedy"?

167
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,720
I have to stay in Jangga Co. to get it.

168
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:52,639
And that's why

169
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:57,018
I'll do my best, Ms. Oh.

170
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:05,818
Ma'am. Please, ma'am.

171
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:07,987
-That money is for my son's school lunch.
-Let go!

172
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:09,489
Please give me a little more time.

173
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,659
Please, I have to make sure
my son gets his lunch at least.

174
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:21,000
-Dad!
-Don't give me such bullshit.

175
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:23,670
Why have him in the first place
if you can't feed him?

176
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:27,507
Ma'am.

177
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:31,219
Ma'am!

178
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:33,346
Gosh.

179
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,017
What are you doing here?

180
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:51,281
I used to be fond of you, but you're mean.

181
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:55,368
What are you talking about?

182
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:59,914
I was just collecting the money
I lent to him. You call that "mean"?

183
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:02,834
What about his son though?
What's he going to eat?

184
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:06,796
He can afford to drink
but doesn't have money to feed his son?

185
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,173
That's ridiculous.

186
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,092
Still.

187
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:14,137
Shut it.

188
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,225
<i>One mussel soup for Table Eight.</i>

189
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:26,733
Toni, can you season
the mussel soup for me?

190
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,068
Sure.

191
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,618
CURRY POWDER

192
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:43,166
-Hey, what about the mung bean sprouts?
-Hang on a second.

193
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,001
All right. It's ready.

194
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:47,503
By the way, why do I smell curry here?

195
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:49,172
We don't have anything with curry.

196
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:57,597
-Toni.
-Yes?

197
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,141
Why did you put curry powder
in the mussel soup?

198
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:03,269
Why is it taking so long?
The orders are...

199
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,403
What are you doing?

200
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,533
This actually isn't bad.

201
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:32,423
DANBAM PUB

202
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:37,470
On cold winter days, we crave
spicy kimchi stew accompanied by soju.

203
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:40,139
All year-round, even if it rains or snows,

204
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:42,016
pubs are there to console us.

205
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,395
Sixteen famous pubs
from all over the country

206
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:46,813
are here.

207
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,648
This is the first round.

208
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:52,485
<i>Which pubs will survive?</i>

209
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:55,530
<i>What will the panelists' choice be?</i>

210
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,366
<i>The search
for the best pub in the country.</i>

211
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:01,411
<i>The winner of the first round.</i>

212
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:03,871
<i>The winner is...</i>

213
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:07,041
WHICH PUB WILL COME IN FIRST PLACE?

214
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,297
<i>THE BEST PUB</i>

215
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:16,092
<i>It's DanBam Pub's Ma Hyun-yi.
Congratulations.</i>

216
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:23,850
Yes, Ma Hyun-yi! Ma Hyun-yi!

217
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,936
Ma Hyun-yi!

218
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:29,147
Ma Hyun-yi!

219
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,318
-Are you that excited?
-Gosh, I'm sorry!

220
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:35,528
Jeez, my ears...

221
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:37,530
THE JUDGES LOVED HER CURRY MUSSEL SOUP

222
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,282
How many times
have we watched this already?

223
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:41,451
You already know I won.
Don't make such a fuss.

224
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,619
It means you're number one in the country.

225
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:48,624
She's our head cook, you know.
This was to be expected.

226
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,376
Didn't you want to fire her?

227
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,296
Me? When? I never said that.

228
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:55,339
I can't live without you, Hyun-yi.

229
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:10,062
Hello, we're not open yet.
Could you come back at 5 p.m.?

230
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:13,983
I'm not here to eat. Is the owner around?

231
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,071
What a nice view.

232
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:23,284
We have to go get ready
for the opening shift.

233
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,453
My apologies.

234
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm Do Jung-myeong,
the CEO of JM Holdings.

235
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,086
I'm interested in franchising DanBam.

236
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:39,091
Franchising our pub?

237
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:43,429
JM Holdings? And you're interested
in franchising our business?

238
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:45,765
Then are you here
with an investment offer?

239
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:47,141
That's correct.

240
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,186
I'm glad you came, sir.

241
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,190
How did you hear about us?

242
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:58,236
We're an investment firm, but we also have
a few stable subsidiaries.

243
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,821
An interior design firm, for example.

244
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,407
We were looking for a franchise business
to partner with,

245
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:06,202
and I happened to watch the show,
<i>The Best Pub</i>, recently.

246
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,168
MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM WINS

247
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:15,503
So the winner is DanBam.

248
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,132
Park Saeroyi's pub.

249
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:22,844
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

250
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:24,512
I suppose I overestimated your abilities.

251
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,515
I'm sorry, sir.

252
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:34,689
This is a cooking competition show
in a tournament format.

253
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:36,607
They've passed the first round,

254
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:39,235
but the current ranking
isn't that important.

255
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:40,862
Enough.

256
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:45,992
We came in second place, sir.

257
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:50,246
I guess you're happy

258
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,707
that we came in second.

259
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,878
I apologize, sir. I'll train him well.

260
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,714
I'll train my own son. You may leave.

261
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:15,605
Don't give me that stupid face.

262
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:19,191
I guess
you just can't gauge the situation.

263
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,071
I guess not.

264
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:28,409
We came in second
among all the famous pubs in the country.

265
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:31,412
What's the problem?

266
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:35,374
Because Saeroyi's pub won?

267
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,634
How would you describe Jangga Co.?

268
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:48,596
-What?
-The best in the restaurant industry.

269
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:51,390
But what?

270
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:54,560
It's a tournament,
and that was only the first round?

271
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:56,395
Coming in second is impressive enough?

272
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:04,820
We're always number one.
That's why we're the best in the industry.

273
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,950
And you just ruined it.

274
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:15,373
I thought you were
determined to prove yourself,

275
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:17,750
but you're such a softie.

276
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:19,085
What?

277
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:23,339
You'll run the company?

278
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:25,841
You're the only alternative I have?

279
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:28,678
Nonsense.

280
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:30,930
"The best."

281
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,392
I even ousted my eldest son
to protect that image.

282
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,478
I wouldn't even hesitate
to desert a punk like you.

283
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,107
Get out.

284
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:53,327
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,795
I thought you were pretty smart.

286
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:08,801
You're a mere employee.

287
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,971
How dare you talk back to the chairman
in front of your manager?

288
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,682
Why are you so confident?

289
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,600
Because he's your father?

290
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:22,857
I know what kind of working relationship
you had with Saeroyi,

291
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:26,610
but things are done differently here.

292
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,449
We are a strictly
vertically structured company.

293
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,409
I don't care even if you're his son.

294
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,829
I do not need an incompetent employee
on my team.

295
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,792
Get used to it quickly.

296
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:47,423
That's all good, but...

297
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,554
Things like "the family"

298
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,890
and "the chairman's son"...

299
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,935
Please refrain
from using such expressions.

300
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:06,025
You don't know much about my relationship
to the family and what kind of life

301
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:08,402
I've lived.

302
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,158
Is that so?

303
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,873
But you see,

304
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:26,879
you didn't even go to college,
and you're not qualified for this job.

305
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:30,466
So how did you get this job
without even going through an interview?

306
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:33,636
Because the chairman
is your father, right?

307
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:37,056
I have no interest in your story.

308
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:38,849
If you don't want to hear these things,

309
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,393
just do your job right.

310
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:55,199
MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM WINS

311
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:57,535
We're definitely benefiting
from being on this show.

312
00:21:58,494 --> 00:21:59,995
We're certainly getting more customers.

313
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:02,289
We've been getting
more franchise inquiries.

314
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:04,291
And now, even an investment offer.

315
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,169
I think now's the perfect time.

316
00:22:07,253 --> 00:22:09,964
Let's streamline our branding.

317
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:12,049
I agree with you, boss.

318
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:16,345
What? What are we doing?

319
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:18,931
-First, we'll--
-First off...

320
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,768
Ta-da. Have a look at this.

321
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:24,186
What is it?

322
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,022
A manual for our interior design,
recipes, and employee guidelines.

323
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:29,942
I put everything together
while working on our reopening.

324
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:33,279
I took all the trials and errors
into consideration.

325
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:38,200
When did you have time
to put this together?

326
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,452
I'm impressed.

327
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,711
We can open another location
right away with this.

328
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:53,799
-What?
-We've been receiving many inquiries.

329
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:55,801
We'll keep on opening locations,
one by one.

330
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:57,595
We'll make it a success

331
00:22:57,678 --> 00:23:00,181
-and participate in the Franchise Expo--
-Hang on.

332
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:02,892
But why do it in such a roundabout way?

333
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:05,436
There's a company
that wants to invest in us.

334
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,813
Oh, that company? Something Holdings?

335
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:15,196
It's too soon to attract investment
to start something.

336
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,447
In what way?

337
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,242
We only have one location now. We don't
have experience in another location.

338
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:24,580
Boss, we managed to do so well
even in this remote alley.

339
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:26,373
You think we need more experience?

340
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,211
For the franchisees,
their livelihood depends on this.

341
00:23:30,294 --> 00:23:31,921
Are you sure we'll never go bust?

342
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,341
What business is completely immune

343
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:37,718
to the risk of going bust?

344
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,222
All I'm saying is,
it's safer to open locations one by one

345
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:44,725
than to open multiple franchise locations
at once.

346
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,605
I understand.

347
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,858
But there's a company
that's willing to invest in us,

348
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:54,109
so we can take that money

349
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:57,696
and create a system
that can manage multiple locations.

350
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,782
If we open locations one by one,

351
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:02,243
when will we catch up with Jangga Co.?

352
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:16,757
Well, Yi-seo does have a point.

353
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:19,134
She always does.

354
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:21,428
Then what's the problem?

355
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:25,557
Nothing, really.
I just want to find the best solution.

356
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:30,646
-CEO Do Jung-myeong...
-Do you know him?

357
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:32,439
I've heard of his name.

358
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:35,192
This investment firm is quite well-known.

359
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:38,112
I'll look into this, just in case.

360
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:40,239
Oh, what about the other thing?

361
00:24:40,322 --> 00:24:41,615
Right, just a second.

362
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:51,125
His name is Toni, right?

363
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:53,585
It's for his visa extension.
Three years would be no problem.

364
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:55,170
Thanks.

365
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:57,589
I told you employing foreigners
can be a headache.

366
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:59,300
All the paperwork is one thing,

367
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:01,343
but that. What a hassle.

368
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:03,137
You're doing it again today?

369
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:06,098
It's not a hassle.
It doesn't even take long.

370
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:09,977
Anyway, find out more information
about JM Holdings. I'm off.

371
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:16,442
<i>I can't get a hold of your boss.</i>

372
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:18,819
<i>I'm a little surprised
because I feel like I'm being clingy.</i>

373
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,238
That's not true, sir.

374
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:24,199
My boss is very careful and cautious.

375
00:25:24,283 --> 00:25:28,120
We're positively considering it,
so please give us a little more time.

376
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,539
Okay. All right, then.

377
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:33,792
But we need to come up with a plan,
so we can't keep on waiting.

378
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:36,628
We'll visit you soon.

379
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:38,297
I'm sorry, sir.

380
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:47,598
Damn it.

381
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:51,185
-What?
-Where's Boss?

382
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:59,485
LOOKING FOR KIM TONI'S FATHER,
KIM DONG-GIL

383
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:06,867
<i>I want pupa soup and a bowl of rice.</i>

384
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:09,787
Ma'am, how many times
do I have to tell you?

385
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,914
You can't order just the side items
on the menu.

386
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:13,332
Why are you saying I can't do it?

387
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:15,334
Chestnut told me it's fine.

388
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:18,420
There he is.

389
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:21,548
I'd like pupa soup and a bowl of rice.

390
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:22,883
Sure.

391
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:28,389
-Hey, Toni.
-Boss, you're back.

392
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,935
Take this. It's the visa application.

393
00:26:33,018 --> 00:26:34,686
You can stay for another three years.

394
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:37,481
Boss.

395
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:41,693
Thank you.

396
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:46,782
Can you put this back there?

397
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,875
NAME IN FULL: KIM TONI

398
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,627
I'm so relieved now.

399
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,797
You need to do all this just to stay?

400
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:04,299
It's stressful being a foreigner.

401
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,843
I told you that I'm Korean.

402
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:07,469
I know that, you fool.

403
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:09,805
Where are you from?

404
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:12,933
I'm from Guinea. It's a country in Africa.

405
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:15,102
Guinea?

406
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,484
Hello.

407
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:24,069
Hello.

408
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:30,075
DANBAM

409
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,751
Did you put these up?

410
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,255
-Yes.
-Someone reported it to us.

411
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:45,132
It's illegal to put up flyers like this.

412
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:48,802
You'll be fined 100,000 won.

413
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:52,097
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

414
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:55,142
I feel bad for the guy looking
for his father, but don't put these up.

415
00:27:56,018 --> 00:27:57,186
Okay.

416
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:06,653
Boss, how long have you been
distributing these?

417
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:09,323
For about a month.

418
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:11,283
Sorry, that wasn't helpful.

419
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:13,368
Don't say that. You've done enough.

420
00:28:14,786 --> 00:28:15,662
Thank you.

421
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:18,957
Don't worry. We'll look for him together.

422
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:23,504
-Boss.
-Yes?

423
00:28:23,795 --> 00:28:24,922
Let's talk.

424
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:26,757
Okay.

425
00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:30,344
Jeez, there she goes again.

426
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:32,012
Hey, just ignore her.

427
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:35,390
Ma'am?

428
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:38,810
Ma'am.

429
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:01,708
What did your friend say?

430
00:29:05,587 --> 00:29:07,256
He said it's a renowned investment firm.

431
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:11,385
There's this thing
I asked Ho-jin to look into it,

432
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,930
and I want to think about it.

433
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:16,348
Then what?

434
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:19,434
It's not like we can stop the bus
once it leaves.

435
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,854
Mr. Do called earlier.

436
00:29:23,647 --> 00:29:24,940
He can't wait indefinitely.

437
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:30,404
It's great that you're trying

438
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:33,156
to help Toni find his father
and to look after everyone else.

439
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,244
But the timing is important,
and there's a thing called priority.

440
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:39,413
Am I the only one who's anxious?

441
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:42,082
Why must you make me so antsy?

442
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:49,256
I'm always the heartless bitch, aren't I?

443
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,882
-Yi-seo.
-Of course, I understand

444
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:52,509
you're the one who makes the call.

445
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:54,553
I will follow your decision.

446
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:56,972
But can't you

447
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:00,684
trust me?

448
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:14,072
Are you confident?

449
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,034
What?

450
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:23,498
Yes.

451
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,083
Okay then.

452
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,627
Let's do it.

453
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:30,422
That's great.

454
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:34,134
But why the sudden change?

455
00:30:35,218 --> 00:30:36,553
Because I trust you the most.

456
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:44,227
You're not mean and coldhearted.

457
00:30:45,604 --> 00:30:47,189
I'm just a stupid boss.

458
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:50,776
I'm sorry

459
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,528
for making you the bad guy.

460
00:30:57,449 --> 00:31:00,494
Schedule a meeting with JM Holdings.

461
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,372
Okay, Boss.

462
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:20,972
First of all,
you need to set the value of your pub.

463
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:22,516
You need to decide on the value

464
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:25,268
if you don't want to get swayed by others.

465
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:30,732
<i>I want to know why you chose DanBam.</i>

466
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,487
You want to know why?

467
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:38,990
I got interested and looked into your pub.

468
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:41,326
You have quite a connection
with Jangga Co.

469
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:44,204
I had the chance to eat
with Chairman Jang a few times

470
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,581
when my father used to do politics,

471
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,875
so I also know him a little.

472
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,586
And I also know what happened
between you two

473
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:53,755
due to the recent incident.

474
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,718
He even made you move out of the place
where you first opened your pub.

475
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,055
A small but sturdy brand

476
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:04,891
that the top food company
thinks of it as a competitor...

477
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:08,395
You managed to come this far
even though you started from scratch.

478
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:10,897
And you also have
a competent and trendy manager.

479
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:15,110
I can say your brand
is surely worth the investment.

480
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:19,698
Is that not enough?

481
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:24,327
It's enough. Thank you for the compliment.

482
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,122
I would like to know

483
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:30,709
exactly how much
you think our brand is worth.

484
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:33,754
You mean the investment?

485
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,965
-I'll invest--
-Five billion won.

486
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,929
I think five billion won will be enough.

487
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,934
Boss.

488
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:54,232
That's how much we think DanBam is worth.

489
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,668
IS DANBAM RECEIVING FIVE BILLION WON
TO BECOME A FRANCHISE?

490
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,507
I can't believe

491
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:21,802
he asked for this much.

492
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:27,390
He's one of a kind.

493
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,561
Hello, this is DanBam.

494
00:33:32,437 --> 00:33:35,357
Yes. An investment? Just a second.

495
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:38,360
Hello, I'm Jo Yi-seo,
the manager of DanBam.

496
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:41,196
We still need to check a few stuff.

497
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,574
-So we can't give you...
-Our boss will call you back.

498
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:46,743
Okay, bye.

499
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:52,541
Hello, this is DanBam.

500
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:54,417
-What is going on?
-Yes.

501
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:57,629
-Yes.
-We'll have to check...

502
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:01,925
JM Holdings became your lead investor.

503
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:05,011
"Lead investor"?

504
00:34:05,095 --> 00:34:08,223
A famous investor
invested five billion won.

505
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:12,477
And that caused others
to trust your brand and do the same.

506
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:18,400
5 BILLION WON, 2.3 BILLION WON,
2 BILLION WON, 250 MILLION WON

507
00:34:18,984 --> 00:34:20,110
If we add all this together,

508
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:22,112
we'll have over 10 billion won.

509
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:24,656
Ten billion won.

510
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:27,367
You got really lucky.

511
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,871
I told you that we've got what it takes.

512
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:33,456
Let's make this worth it.

513
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,251
Okay.

514
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,345
He invested five billion won in DanBam?

515
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,264
Yes, sir.

516
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:53,476
There are also other investors,
and they got over ten billion won.

517
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,396
They rented an office
to turn their business into a brand.

518
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:59,983
Twenty people signed up to open the pub,
and over 50 people are waiting--

519
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,192
That's enough.

520
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:49,032
-Soft tofu stew
-Here?

521
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:56,498
We need to know the trend
of the alcohol market.

522
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:58,750
People are starting to drink alone...

523
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:02,128
Our signature menus are soft-tofu stew
and stir-fried pork belly.

524
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:03,588
Go ahead and try some.

525
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:06,549
Okay, everyone. Cheers to IC.

526
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,718
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

527
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:51,011
Ma'am.

528
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:53,888
I'm not a ghost. Why are you so startled?

529
00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:55,223
Ma'am.

530
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:57,767
Look at you.

531
00:36:57,976 --> 00:37:00,103
You're drinking again?
You can't even feed your son.

532
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:03,106
-My goodness gracious.
-No, wait. The thing is...

533
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:08,987
Are you kidding me?

534
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:13,199
-Are you serious? How could you?
-Give it back.

535
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:16,327
You're going to die
without even paying me back?

536
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:18,830
You useless punk!

537
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:22,208
What do you expect me to do?
I can't even afford food for my son.

538
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:25,045
Do you think
he'll be able to eat if you die?

539
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:28,131
You should think about getting a job.
How can you call yourself a dad?

540
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:31,634
You're just going to die
and forget about everything?

541
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,512
-You reckless punk!
-Stop it!

542
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:38,183
Ma'am!

543
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,981
Five billion? Ten billion?

544
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,941
It's so unreal!

545
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,443
What did I tell you guys?

546
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:50,779
If Saeroyi says we can do it,
then we can really do it!

547
00:37:51,112 --> 00:37:52,572
And I told you

548
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:54,741
that it's all thanks to you guys.

549
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:58,244
Look.

550
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:00,789
Ma'am.

551
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:03,833
Ma'am!

552
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:06,252
HANGUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

553
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,800
You don't need to worry.
She'll be fine once she gets some rest.

554
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:13,218
Thank you.

555
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:19,057
I'm sorry.

556
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:21,810
Go die.

557
00:38:22,393 --> 00:38:23,937
-Go kill yourself.
-Ma'am.

558
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:27,357
Stop it.

559
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:35,323
I'm such a useless father.
I thought he'd be better off without me.

560
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,868
You're unbelievable.

561
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:43,957
If you have the guts to die,
you should try your best to stay alive.

562
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,751
Don't make it sound like it's nothing.

563
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:49,629
Do you know how it feels
to see your child starve?

564
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:51,339
You don't even have a family.

565
00:38:51,422 --> 00:38:54,509
Are you kidding me?
How dare you yell at me?

566
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:55,844
Ma'am, calm down.

567
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:00,723
Sir.

568
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:04,978
I'd rather have a dad

569
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:07,105
than a full stomach.

570
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,528
Your son will be sad.

571
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,241
Whenever you're gone,

572
00:39:20,702 --> 00:39:21,786
he always thinks of you

573
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:24,414
and misses you.

574
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:40,346
-Here.
-What?

575
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,639
Take it.

576
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:44,142
I'll buy this from you.

577
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:49,480
I'll use this to grill some meat at home.

578
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,233
Get going.

579
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:55,069
Didn't you hear him? Your son is waiting.

580
00:39:57,238 --> 00:39:58,239
Ma'am.

581
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:11,211
Goodbye, sir.

582
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:17,258
Your family must be worried.

583
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:18,927
Shouldn't you call them?

584
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:21,888
I also once

585
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:24,599
had a family.

586
00:40:30,271 --> 00:40:31,481
He lived his entire life

587
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:36,611
doing what I always asked him to do.

588
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:41,032
He was a kind son.

589
00:40:45,036 --> 00:40:48,873
But one day, he suddenly told me
that he married a black woman.

590
00:40:54,796 --> 00:40:56,839
She was from Africa.

591
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:00,802
She was Guinean.

592
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:06,641
But I disapproved.

593
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,477
Then by any chance...

594
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,895
Ma'am.

595
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:12,772
Here.

596
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:14,732
Take a look at this.

597
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:22,782
LOOKING FOR KIM TONI'S FATHER,
KIM DONG-GIL

598
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:29,956
For the first time in his life,

599
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,959
he told me what he wanted.

600
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:37,964
But I disapproved of it.

601
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:44,429
He must've hated me so much.

602
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:49,017
Where is your son?

603
00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:55,231
He died.

604
00:41:58,359 --> 00:41:59,944
Due to a car accident.

605
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,294
I'm sorry, my baby.

606
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:39,984
<i>I really don't know what to say.</i>

607
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:41,986
At least he found his grandmother.

608
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,156
He'll finally be able
to get his citizenship.

609
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:48,576
My gosh, she has no compassion.

610
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:52,580
Is Toni going to keep working with us?

611
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,334
We'll let him decide.

612
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:58,795
Let's just focus on our business for now.

613
00:43:02,924 --> 00:43:05,134
Okay, I got it.

614
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,932
We need to cook a stew or soup.
Without artificial seasoning.

615
00:43:11,015 --> 00:43:12,350
No artificial seasoning?

616
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,187
How about <i>cheonggukjang</i>?

617
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,230
<i>Cheonggukjang</i>?

618
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:21,150
I'm the best
when it comes to <i>cheonggukjang</i>.

619
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:23,194
You know how good I am.

620
00:43:24,612 --> 00:43:26,656
How did you find out the mission?

621
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,119
Well, let's just say
I have some connections.

622
00:43:31,202 --> 00:43:32,662
That's amazing.

623
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:35,289
Everyone knows that she's amazing.

624
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:38,584
Geun-soo, you should learn from her.

625
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:41,504
<i>Cheonggukjang</i>.

626
00:43:47,802 --> 00:43:51,556
That's too thick.
That's not how you do it.

627
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,267
Try to keep it thin.

628
00:43:56,602 --> 00:43:58,271
I learned at the pub.

629
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:00,314
But I still can't get it right.

630
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:04,610
Don't you hate me?

631
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:11,117
Why are you here?

632
00:44:12,493 --> 00:44:14,495
Dad told me a lot about you.

633
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:20,751
"We were poor.

634
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:24,255
But thanks to her, we never knew that.

635
00:44:25,548 --> 00:44:27,091
Your grandmother starved.

636
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:29,760
But I was always full.

637
00:44:31,345 --> 00:44:33,139
And I learned how incredible that was

638
00:44:35,183 --> 00:44:36,726
after you were born."

639
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:45,401
Dad didn't hate you.

640
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:48,654
The reason he came back to Korea

641
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:52,909
was because he wanted to thank you.

642
00:44:59,832 --> 00:45:01,501
Let me tell you on his behalf.

643
00:45:04,712 --> 00:45:05,713
Grandma.

644
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:09,425
Thank you.

645
00:45:23,648 --> 00:45:24,649
Grandma.

646
00:45:26,442 --> 00:45:27,568
Thank you.

647
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:50,591
Come in.

648
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:52,218
Hyun-yi.

649
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:56,097
Well, look who's here.

650
00:45:56,847 --> 00:45:59,267
It's Geun-soo who just left to Jangga Co.
without telling me.

651
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,851
I'm sorry.

652
00:46:01,185 --> 00:46:04,355
I was going to call,
but I've been really busy.

653
00:46:05,606 --> 00:46:07,024
Where are Saeroyi and Yi-seo?

654
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:08,818
They went to meet the producer.

655
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:11,279
Have you been well?

656
00:46:11,862 --> 00:46:12,780
Yes.

657
00:46:13,114 --> 00:46:14,156
What about you?

658
00:46:14,282 --> 00:46:16,284
I was really startled
when I saw you on TV.

659
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:18,953
Oh, right.

660
00:46:19,453 --> 00:46:20,538
It's awkward, isn't it?

661
00:46:21,831 --> 00:46:24,041
No, you look gorgeous.

662
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:26,586
Your new look suits you.

663
00:46:27,253 --> 00:46:28,337
Thanks.

664
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:35,052
Today's mission is also very challenging.

665
00:46:35,136 --> 00:46:36,637
They need to make stew or soup

666
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:39,223
without using any sugar, salt
or other artificial seasonings.

667
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:43,144
Most of the chefs are
cooking stew right now.

668
00:46:43,227 --> 00:46:47,481
Kimchi stew, fish cake soup,
and <i>doenjang</i> stew.

669
00:46:47,565 --> 00:46:50,735
I'm starting to crave soju
just by smelling all this food.

670
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:54,322
And let's take a look
at last week's number one.

671
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:56,324
Ma Hyun-yi from DanBam Pub.

672
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:58,993
Can you tell us what you're cooking?

673
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:01,829
Yes, I'm cooking soft tofu stew,
our pub's signature menu.

674
00:47:01,912 --> 00:47:03,331
That's really new.

675
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:05,124
Your pub's signature menu
is soft tofu stew?

676
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:09,378
Yes, our boss loves this menu.

677
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:11,756
But you're kind of in the way.

678
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,425
Oh, okay. She's very cold.

679
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:17,219
People call her the Coldhearted Witch.

680
00:47:18,012 --> 00:47:19,764
DanBam's soft tofu stew.

681
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:22,224
And Jangga Co.'s <i>cheonggukjang</i>.

682
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:24,018
You've had both, right?

683
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:26,687
Yes, they're both good.

684
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:29,440
It'll depend on the judges' preference.

685
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:32,693
Who do you think will win?

686
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,325
Jangga Co.

687
00:47:41,911 --> 00:47:43,079
will lose.

688
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:53,214
-Let's give it a taste.
-Okay.

689
00:47:58,803 --> 00:48:01,639
The competition has come to an end.

690
00:48:01,722 --> 00:48:03,099
<i>The Best Pub</i>.

691
00:48:03,182 --> 00:48:05,017
Among the eight teams,

692
00:48:05,726 --> 00:48:08,229
which team do you think will be

693
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:11,440
the winner of the second round?

694
00:48:14,026 --> 00:48:15,736
The winner of the second round

695
00:48:18,155 --> 00:48:19,448
is right here in my hand.

696
00:48:23,994 --> 00:48:26,872
This is unbelievable.
It's Ma Hyun-yi from DanBam Pub!

697
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:27,873
Congratulations!

698
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:34,880
WINNER OF QUARTERFINALS
MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM

699
00:48:48,978 --> 00:48:53,691
<i>My mom used to tell me
that she hates black bean noodles</i>

700
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:57,486
Why are you all so down?

701
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:01,031
It's nothing.

702
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:02,992
You did great, Mr. Park.

703
00:49:03,075 --> 00:49:05,035
You too, Ms. Oh.

704
00:49:05,953 --> 00:49:07,621
Geun-soo, you did great too.

705
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:14,754
Ms. Oh deserves most of the credit.

706
00:49:15,546 --> 00:49:16,922
She'll probably get scolded

707
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:19,759
by the chairman again.

708
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:24,388
You became popular
after the last episode aired, right?

709
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:26,766
You even held autograph sessions.

710
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:28,601
What?

711
00:49:29,185 --> 00:49:31,645
You could've spent time
getting ready for the second round.

712
00:49:31,729 --> 00:49:34,440
-Hey.
-Are you trying to tell me

713
00:49:34,523 --> 00:49:38,569
that I'm not doing my best
because I held a few autograph sessions?

714
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:42,114
Of course not.

715
00:49:42,198 --> 00:49:44,158
He doesn't know what he's saying.

716
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,287
Hey, do you think it's easy
to come in second place?

717
00:49:49,288 --> 00:49:52,708
<i>We're always number one.
That's why we're the best in the industry.</i>

718
00:49:53,918 --> 00:49:54,919
I know, right?

719
00:49:56,545 --> 00:49:58,547
That's what I thought,

720
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:01,967
but I heard we can't be
like that at Jangga Co.

721
00:50:02,718 --> 00:50:04,428
My father, I mean...

722
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,098
The Chairman told me.

723
00:50:10,142 --> 00:50:11,602
"Jangga Co.

724
00:50:13,521 --> 00:50:15,231
has always been at its peak."

725
00:50:16,732 --> 00:50:18,984
"If you want to settle for second place,

726
00:50:19,652 --> 00:50:23,030
you don't deserve to be in Jangga Co."

727
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:29,912
I'm just worried about you.

728
00:50:31,288 --> 00:50:32,373
Thank you

729
00:50:33,082 --> 00:50:34,416
for being so concerned.

730
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,847
I was being impertinent again.

731
00:50:48,222 --> 00:50:49,223
I'm sorry.

732
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,726
Don't be. You weren't wrong about that.

733
00:50:52,893 --> 00:50:55,062
I thought Mr. Park was being too carefree.

734
00:50:56,188 --> 00:50:57,022
Well done.

735
00:50:59,191 --> 00:51:00,359
Soo-ah.

736
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:02,820
How are you, Geun-soo?

737
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:05,614
It's good to see you here.

738
00:51:06,115 --> 00:51:07,867
I read articles about your investments.

739
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:10,327
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

740
00:51:10,995 --> 00:51:12,329
You look great in that suit.

741
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:14,707
Thank you.

742
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:16,333
Do I look good?

743
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:17,835
So so.

744
00:51:18,752 --> 00:51:20,880
Congratulations on winning first place.

745
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:23,591
Congratulations on second place.

746
00:51:24,258 --> 00:51:25,926
Are you happy
that you excel at everything?

747
00:51:29,263 --> 00:51:31,348
We're going to have a party.
Do you want to come?

748
00:51:31,432 --> 00:51:32,641
The guys will be there.

749
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:35,936
Forget it, Boss. We don't need
someone who already quit.

750
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:38,564
What do you want?

751
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:42,109
I want to go.

752
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:45,863
So the winner is paying.

753
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:47,406
Well...

754
00:51:47,698 --> 00:51:48,532
Sure.

755
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:01,503
Why aren't you doing anything?

756
00:52:02,796 --> 00:52:04,548
Meddling in now won't
make things any better.

757
00:52:05,215 --> 00:52:08,010
Everything is all about timing, Geun-soo.

758
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:11,555
Just wait for another two years.
You'll see how it ends.

759
00:52:14,266 --> 00:52:15,267
What about Jangga Co.?

760
00:52:15,893 --> 00:52:18,228
Is everything good there
as you joined it through nepotism?

761
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:21,732
I'm still trying to adjust.

762
00:52:21,815 --> 00:52:24,318
I see. We should stay in close contact.

763
00:52:24,401 --> 00:52:26,070
You could tell me some trade secrets.

764
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:30,366
Have you been doing well?

765
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:34,244
What? It hasn't even
been long since you quit.

766
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:36,580
I know.

767
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:39,041
It hasn't been long,

768
00:52:40,459 --> 00:52:41,543
but I miss the time already.

769
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:44,588
But you seemed quite cool when you quit.

770
00:52:44,672 --> 00:52:45,923
I told you.

771
00:52:46,632 --> 00:52:47,800
It was because of you.

772
00:52:52,596 --> 00:52:54,139
Aren't you guys going to eat?

773
00:52:54,473 --> 00:52:55,474
I'm coming.

774
00:53:05,943 --> 00:53:07,277
Let's keep on going like this.

775
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:08,946
-Congratulations.
-Well done.

776
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:10,280
Cheers.

777
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,912
Hyun-yi, you looked so cool today.

778
00:53:16,996 --> 00:53:19,039
I almost fell for you.

779
00:53:19,123 --> 00:53:21,542
What? Have you not fallen for me yet?

780
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,544
Gosh, it's my mistake.

781
00:53:23,627 --> 00:53:25,754
I've fallen for you long ago.

782
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:27,339
That's absurd.

783
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,508
What's wrong with him now?

784
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:35,139
What are you looking at?

785
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:39,685
Hyun-yi, congratulations.

786
00:53:41,395 --> 00:53:43,856
Go easy on us. You're being matchless.

787
00:53:43,939 --> 00:53:45,566
I know. I've been lucky.

788
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,735
Fill your glasses. Let me make a toast.

789
00:53:51,905 --> 00:53:52,823
All right.

790
00:53:58,829 --> 00:54:01,331
-Jo Yi-seo, it's you.
-Gosh.

791
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:03,125
I said I didn't want to do this.

792
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:05,085
Who would play Truth or Dare these days?

793
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:06,879
Why? It's fun.

794
00:54:09,298 --> 00:54:12,593
What about you, Saeroyi?
Do you have any questions for Yi-seo?

795
00:54:14,803 --> 00:54:16,096
Well...

796
00:54:17,681 --> 00:54:21,685
If there's anything you want to know,
you can ask me.

797
00:54:27,274 --> 00:54:29,234
Not really. I know everything about her.

798
00:54:34,865 --> 00:54:35,991
Let me ask her then.

799
00:54:38,118 --> 00:54:41,497
Hey, this isn't fun.
Let's just get this over with.

800
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,750
You said you'd come to me

801
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:47,169
once I take over Jangga Co.

802
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:53,675
Do you remember that?

803
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:57,096
Yes.

804
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,681
I remember that, but it's just--

805
00:54:59,765 --> 00:55:01,141
Okay. I'm done.

806
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:05,395
-I'm glad you remember it.
-Hey.

807
00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:07,397
What? Is there something
going on between you two?

808
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:08,816
Gosh, hell no.

809
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:12,402
That's not true. Boss, it's not like that.

810
00:55:12,486 --> 00:55:14,738
What? Okay.

811
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:17,699
Can't you be more respectful to me?

812
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:19,993
Do you have any more questions?

813
00:55:20,077 --> 00:55:21,328
It's not fun. Let's move on.

814
00:55:21,411 --> 00:55:22,496
Let me spin it.

815
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:30,087
-All right, Boss.
-It's you, Boss.

816
00:55:33,215 --> 00:55:34,716
Do you have any questions for me?

817
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,885
Of course, we do.
Let me ask you something.

818
00:55:39,972 --> 00:55:42,766
Your first kiss. When was your first kiss?

819
00:55:53,777 --> 00:55:56,363
-I don't have one.
-What do you mean?

820
00:55:57,072 --> 00:56:00,200
You don't? No way. That's ridiculous.

821
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:02,369
I've never kissed.

822
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:05,789
You've never kissed a woman before
at your age?

823
00:56:21,305 --> 00:56:22,431
Is it sad?

824
00:56:26,018 --> 00:56:27,019
I mean...

825
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:29,271
Well... I have a question.

826
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:30,230
What?

827
00:56:30,314 --> 00:56:34,401
Between you and Soo-ah.

828
00:56:34,484 --> 00:56:35,819
What's going on?

829
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:38,071
Are you sure you are friends?

830
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:45,579
It's just...

831
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,001
I like Soo-ah.

832
00:56:53,712 --> 00:56:54,796
Seriously?

833
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:56,548
What?

834
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:02,721
Can't you see what's going on?

835
00:57:02,804 --> 00:57:04,097
Why did you pinch me?

836
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,807
Congratulations.

837
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,358
It's my turn.

838
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:17,736
Why do you guys have so many questions?

839
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:20,948
Did you ever

840
00:57:23,033 --> 00:57:24,910
have feelings for Yi-seo?

841
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:32,417
<i>You son of a...</i>

842
00:57:50,143 --> 00:57:51,103
No.

843
00:57:51,812 --> 00:57:53,563
Not even once.

844
00:58:01,071 --> 00:58:03,740
She's my friend and partner.

845
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:09,746
What kind of question is that?
Isn't it obvious?

846
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,790
You should take a shot.

847
00:58:16,586 --> 00:58:17,587
<i>Well...</i>

848
00:58:18,922 --> 00:58:21,091
<i>I knew it though.</i>

849
00:58:26,513 --> 00:58:28,348
<i>I already knew it, but...</i>

850
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:30,892
Are you guys done?

851
00:58:31,435 --> 00:58:33,353
Yes. Well done, Hyun-yi.

852
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:37,941
What?

853
00:58:42,571 --> 00:58:43,822
Yi-seo.

854
00:58:44,406 --> 00:58:45,240
Yes?

855
00:58:48,702 --> 00:58:49,953
Are you crying?

856
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,960
What's wrong with me?

857
00:58:58,712 --> 00:58:59,963
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

858
00:59:03,091 --> 00:59:03,925
What's wrong?

859
00:59:08,555 --> 00:59:10,098
What are you waiting for?

860
00:59:10,974 --> 00:59:13,727
-What?
-Do you not know? She's hurt.

861
00:59:14,936 --> 00:59:16,396
Go bring her.

862
00:59:18,565 --> 00:59:20,233
She's hurt?

863
00:59:20,317 --> 00:59:21,985
Then he shouldn't go after her.

864
00:59:27,366 --> 00:59:29,159
You said you don't have feelings for her.

865
00:59:31,661 --> 00:59:33,580
If you go to her,
you'll be giving her false hope.

866
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:38,001
You don't have to
be so firm to hurt her feelings.

867
00:59:40,629 --> 00:59:41,922
You said that she means a lot.

868
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:44,633
Don't let her cry alone.

869
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:55,268
I'll be right back.

870
00:59:58,063 --> 01:00:00,440
What is going on?

871
01:00:01,525 --> 01:00:05,278
Does Yi-seo like him?

872
01:00:05,362 --> 01:00:07,280
Geun-soo, why are you being like this?

873
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:10,033
Me?

874
01:00:11,618 --> 01:00:12,869
Why?

875
01:00:14,996 --> 01:00:16,373
What you just did.

876
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,750
It was so sick.

877
01:00:33,723 --> 01:00:34,724
<i>Yi-seo.</i>

878
01:00:36,726 --> 01:00:37,727
Stop there.

879
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:46,236
Why are you being like this?

880
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:47,487
Let go of me.

881
01:00:51,908 --> 01:00:52,909
It's cold.

882
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,328
-Let's go in.
-Get off me.

883
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:58,415
You said you don't have feelings for me.

884
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,834
What's wrong with you?

885
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:03,837
You're a smart girl.
Why are you acting like a kid?

886
01:01:06,339 --> 01:01:08,550
I had a plan for two years.

887
01:01:10,051 --> 01:01:12,304
But Geun-soo just ruined the whole thing.

888
01:01:14,556 --> 01:01:15,557
What?

889
01:01:18,143 --> 01:01:19,352
If that's the case,

890
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:23,190
I'm going for plan B.

891
01:01:31,156 --> 01:01:32,240
<i>I should</i>

892
01:01:34,075 --> 01:01:35,243
<i>tell him now.</i>

893
01:01:40,123 --> 01:01:41,291
<i>I feel like</i>

894
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:44,002
<i>my heart will burst out of my chest.</i>

895
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:50,592
-Are you all right?
-I love you.

896
01:01:59,684 --> 01:02:00,852
I love you.

897
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:06,650
I love you, Boss.

898
01:02:09,444 --> 01:02:10,737
I love you.

899
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:14,199
I really love you.

900
01:02:29,422 --> 01:02:30,423
It's just

901
01:02:32,342 --> 01:02:34,094
you're mistaken

902
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:36,513
because we're like a family and you feel--

903
01:02:36,596 --> 01:02:38,348
I'm not mistaken.

904
01:02:40,058 --> 01:02:43,895
I've never thought of you as a family.

905
01:02:50,402 --> 01:02:52,404
From the moment we first met

906
01:02:53,154 --> 01:02:54,364
until now,

907
01:02:55,615 --> 01:02:58,702
I couldn't be more sure about my feelings.

908
01:03:12,257 --> 01:03:14,259
I heard Geun-soo likes you.

909
01:03:16,219 --> 01:03:18,597
You said you'd go out with him
if things go well for him.

910
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,975
-That's how we're supposed--
-Why are you talking about Geun-soo?

911
01:03:25,645 --> 01:03:26,479
I just

912
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:29,733
said that the other day,
but I didn't mean it.

913
01:03:29,816 --> 01:03:32,152
I just said such a thing

914
01:03:32,235 --> 01:03:35,488
to take advantage of his feelings
to help you.

915
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:37,907
What's that?

916
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:40,994
Do you not care about Geun-soo's feelings?

917
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:43,788
How could you do that
with someone's feelings?

918
01:03:43,872 --> 01:03:44,706
I know

919
01:03:45,915 --> 01:03:47,792
that it's not ethical.

920
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:51,338
I don't expect you to understand me.

921
01:03:52,964 --> 01:03:56,176
I just don't want to lie to you.

922
01:03:56,259 --> 01:03:57,719
This is me.

923
01:03:59,512 --> 01:04:00,680
But

924
01:04:01,598 --> 01:04:03,808
since I know you hate things like this...

925
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,393
Now that I know it,

926
01:04:05,477 --> 01:04:07,646
I won't be like that anymore.

927
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:09,814
So

928
01:04:10,732 --> 01:04:12,150
stop talking about Geun-soo

929
01:04:12,817 --> 01:04:15,320
and see me for what I really am.

930
01:04:22,202 --> 01:04:23,203
Yi-seo.

931
01:04:24,954 --> 01:04:26,915
I'm ten years older than you.

932
01:04:32,796 --> 01:04:34,547
Things have been good for us so far.

933
01:04:36,591 --> 01:04:38,635
-I have a lot of things to do and--
-That's enough.

934
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:42,055
If you don't like me,

935
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:44,933
that's just what it is.

936
01:04:48,561 --> 01:04:51,439
Work, age gap, and all that.

937
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,150
They are just excuses.

938
01:04:57,153 --> 01:05:00,365
That's the last thing
I want to hear from you.

939
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:09,916
All you need

940
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:12,794
is one word.

941
01:05:16,965 --> 01:05:17,966
Is it

942
01:05:19,342 --> 01:05:20,760
never going to happen?

943
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,531
No.

944
01:05:44,117 --> 01:05:45,493
Don't like me.

945
01:07:13,164 --> 01:07:14,582
<i>My life</i>

946
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,793
<i>is a little</i>

947
01:07:18,294 --> 01:07:19,462
<i>bitter.</i>

948
01:07:19,546 --> 01:07:21,464
I want

949
01:07:22,674 --> 01:07:24,092
my bitter night

950
01:07:27,595 --> 01:07:29,347
to be sweet.

951
01:08:00,879 --> 01:08:02,213
I have you.

952
01:08:08,136 --> 01:08:09,679
That just consoled me

953
01:08:10,638 --> 01:08:12,015
more than anything.

954
01:08:54,462 --> 01:08:56,165
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON NO-MIN,
LEE JUN-HYEOK, AND KIM IL-JUNG.

<i>So it's the final round, right?</i>

957
01:09:18,623 --> 01:09:20,583
<i>I have a high card
that I don't want to use.</i>

958
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:22,335
So is this the high card you talked about?

959
01:09:22,418 --> 01:09:24,754
I told you. You can do this.
Good luck, Ma Hyun-yi.

960
01:09:24,837 --> 01:09:26,756
Look how we ended up after trusting her.

961
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:28,633
You all signed a deal after you came here.

962
01:09:28,716 --> 01:09:30,259
You decided after you tasted our food!

963
01:09:30,343 --> 01:09:31,886
<i>All the staff are struggling,</i>

964
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:33,721
<i>but the president
only cares about his pride.</i>

965
01:09:33,805 --> 01:09:35,640
Forget the whole thing and come to me.

966
01:09:36,224 --> 01:09:39,477
And the harder he tries,
the harder he'll fall and collapse.

967
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,480
<i>I'm burning with anger.</i>
