EPISODE 14

5
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:26,581
I'm so touched.

6
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,423
-Give it back.
-Why? No.

7
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,008
It's cold.

8
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:49,354
Why are you sleeping here? Go home.

9
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:55,986
I fell asleep.

10
00:01:57,988 --> 00:01:59,531
I have a lot of things to prepare for.

11
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:03,910
-For the buyer in China?
-Yes.

12
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:07,956
I've taken care of all their requests.

13
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:10,208
The contract will be renewed
at the next meeting.

14
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:15,964
You're busy.

15
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:20,927
What's wrong?

16
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:24,306
Did something happen?

17
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:30,312
<i>The old man</i>

18
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:33,398
is dying?

19
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:37,569
A shareholder meeting will be held soon
to appoint a new chairman.

20
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:41,198
He'll want Jang Geun-soo
to be his successor.

21
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:46,369
So? You want to stop him
from getting appointed?

22
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,914
Our ultimate goal
is Chairman Jang's dismissal.

23
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:50,832
But how?

24
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,294
He's in good terms
with two of the non-executive directors.

25
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:56,963
Right, Yang Sang-un and Shin U-je.

26
00:02:57,047 --> 00:03:00,759
The board members and the CEO
should never be too close.

27
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:04,054
As for Mr. Yang, he even manages
Chairman Jang's borrowed-name stocks.

28
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:05,806
It provides enough grounds.

29
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,767
We'll remove Mr. Yang from the board
and use that

30
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,644
to weaken Chairman Jang.

31
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,230
Will you be all right though?

32
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:17,234
Didn't you say
Geun-soo used to work at DanBam?

33
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:20,195
Are you sure
you want to go at him like this?

34
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:25,534
Mr. Park?

35
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:29,663
Geun-soo wouldn't expect me to be
that considerate. The same goes for me.

36
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,711
Then who will replace Mr. Yang
after we get him removed?

37
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:40,799
Saeroyi doesn't qualify
because he's a CEO of a corporation.

38
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:42,592
Me.

39
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:48,974
But in most cases,
renowned professors or public officials--

40
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:51,935
A business management specialist
who can act as an advisor.

41
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,063
And as an inspector who can prevent
the CEO's dogmatic decisions.

42
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:57,899
Isn't that what the board members do?

43
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:00,527
That's right.

44
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:03,196
Named as one of Asia's
power businesswomen by Forbes.

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,781
The businesswoman who turned

46
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:07,117
a tiny pub into the company
that is known as IC Co. today.

47
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,703
That's me.

48
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:13,957
-That's true.
-Definitely.

49
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,418
It's just that you're too young.

50
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:19,421
Right, but she'd be perfect for the role.

51
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,631
She's extremely competent.

52
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,259
We've seen what she can do.

53
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,470
Let's go for it.

54
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:32,851
It'll go well, right?

55
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,188
Yes, there won't be any problems.

56
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,341
<i>I said I support it,</i>

57
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:05,759
but with the thing in China too...

58
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,260
Can you handle everything?

59
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:11,264
Do you have time to worry about that?

60
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,060
Well...

61
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:18,313
If you feel that bad,

62
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:20,565
grant me a wish.

63
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,068
What's your wish?

64
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,029
Please go on a date with me.

65
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,410
I told you not to cross the line.

66
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,833
It's my wish.

67
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,298
So is Chairman Jang

68
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:48,260
in the hospital now?

69
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:50,470
I'm not sure.

70
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:54,099
There hasn't been anything about it
on the media yet,

71
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:56,309
but they can't keep it
from the media forever.

72
00:05:58,353 --> 00:06:01,606
People will start talking about it
if he continues to miss work.

73
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:35,890
There's been an article about
corruption allegations against Mr. Yang.

74
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:37,350
I read it.

75
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:40,437
I bet it was Park Saeroyi's doing.

76
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:42,439
What should we do?

77
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:44,316
We can't bury this.

78
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:47,360
I must oust Mr. Yang myself.

79
00:06:47,444 --> 00:06:48,486
The important thing is,

80
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:51,114
who will take his seat?

81
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:53,158
As the new non-executive director.

82
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:57,579
I'll come up with a list of candidates
who are in support of us.

83
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:01,958
Forget it.

84
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,044
Pardon?

85
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:06,129
I bet Park Saeroyi

86
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,424
is also thinking of someone
who's in support of him,

87
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:10,633
so we will

88
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:14,596
vouch for someone
who meets all the qualifications.

89
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,140
We'll fight fair and square.

90
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:18,850
Right.

91
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:22,354
Just one non-executive director
can't affect the voting rights that much.

92
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:27,192
It'd be better for us to focus
on protecting your public image.

93
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:30,445
Then proceed accordingly.

94
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,199
You seem to be

95
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:36,910
doing a little better.

96
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:44,250
-I'm not sure about that.
-<i>Punished by Heaven?</i>

97
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,127
<i>Who said you can do that?</i>

98
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:48,338
<i>You should be punished by me.</i>

99
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:50,799
<i>Don't die just yet.</i>

100
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:57,639
I feel relieved

101
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,100
for a change.

102
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,317
<i>I've seen this man before.</i>

103
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,735
He and Ms. Kang are close.

104
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,404
I'll set up a meeting.

105
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,490
Him and this man too.

106
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:20,537
You should take a break.
I'll go over the rest.

107
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:27,919
OH SOO-AH

108
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:37,846
Hello?

109
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:42,308
Today?

110
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:49,774
I'm pretty busy today.
Can we meet another day?

111
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:54,195
Gosh,
it's practically impossible to see you.

112
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:57,532
It's all right. I'll see you another time.

113
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,367
But call me, okay?

114
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,161
All right.

115
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,414
Was that Soo-ah?

116
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,168
Yes.

117
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,962
She wants to meet now?

118
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:20,430
Someone can't even go on a date
because she has to work all night,

119
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:24,517
but look at you flirting with a girl
on the phone.

120
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:29,272
Don't...

121
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:33,902
do that to me.

122
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:35,737
What?

123
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:39,908
Stop doing and saying things
to show that you like me.

124
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,582
I clearly told you
that I don't have any feelings for you.

125
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,713
I know.

126
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:58,051
Go ahead and meet her.
I was going to do this alone anyway.

127
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:18,780
Why do I have to feel sorry for you?

128
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:24,744
What's with you all of a sudden?
I'm fine, so just--

129
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:27,830
Why do you have to make me feel so uneasy?

130
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:43,137
Never mind.

131
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:47,892
Sorry. Just ignore what I just said.
Don't go home too late.

132
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,894
Do you know why you feel that way?

133
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,355
What?

134
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:08,037
I guess you are starting

135
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:10,915
to have feelings for me.

136
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,965
-What are you--
-I know you better than anyone.

137
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:24,762
You finally

138
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,348
think of me as a woman.

139
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:51,456
<i>We've settled things with the press.</i>

140
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:55,376
How are we going to retrieve the stocks
that are under Mr. Yang's name?

141
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:58,004
There's not that much.

142
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,381
Just let him have it.

143
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:03,176
He can use that to support us.

144
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,804
Yes, sir.

145
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:15,813
Chairman Jang fired Mr. Yang
without hesitation.

146
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:18,274
What is he thinking?

147
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:23,363
Is Yi-seo getting ready?

148
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:26,032
Ms. Kang is helping her meet people.

149
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,369
To be honest, I'm a little worried.

150
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:30,828
About what?

151
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:33,498
We both know how competent she is.

152
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,458
But others will think of her as a kid.

153
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,794
Plus, Jangga Co. tends to be
very conservative.

154
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:42,340
She'll do well.

155
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:44,592
How can you be so sure?

156
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:47,553
It's Yi-seo.

157
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:55,061
Welcome.

158
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:57,814
It's nice to meet you all.

159
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:00,358
You all know her, right?
She's Jo Yi-seo, CFO of IC Co.

160
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,652
-This is--
-President of Sungyoon University.

161
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:05,822
Business professor at Gwangjin University.
Former bureau chief of TJBC.

162
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:08,157
Former president of Mingu Bank.
Did I get that right?

163
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:10,451
It's an honor to meet you all.

164
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:11,577
Nice to meet you.

165
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:13,621
She really is clever.

166
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:16,124
Thank you. Take your seats.

167
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,386
-Hello.
-Hello, I'm Jo Yi-seo.

168
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,763
Hello, I'm President Jo.
It's nice to meet you.

169
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,224
-I'm glad we got to meet today.
-Same here.

170
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:42,567
Number one. Chicken vegetable tacos.

171
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:46,112
Number two. Broccoli and chicken wraps.

172
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:48,197
I look forward to working with you.

173
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:51,242
-See you at the stockholders' meeting.
-Okay.

174
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:03,713
How many tables?

175
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:06,549
I think 14 will do.

176
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,676
Did you make sure to leave some space?

177
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,636
Gosh, of course.

178
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:14,432
Toni, you're a professional now.

179
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:16,142
It's been years already.

180
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,312
Yi-seo, your nose is bleeding.

181
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:29,113
You'll fall ill at this rate.
You should get some rest today.

182
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:34,702
It's okay. I need to meet
the stockholders soon.

183
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:39,791
Hey.

184
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,377
Are you ready? Shall we get going?

185
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:45,713
I just got a call from Mr. Kim.

186
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:48,716
And he asked for a raincheck
because his wife went into labor.

187
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:51,385
Really?

188
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:55,139
It's actually for the better.
You should get some rest today.

189
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:14,826
Geun-soo?

190
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:18,246
What are you doing here?

191
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:20,998
Are you here to meet the stockholders?

192
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:25,002
But I beat you to it.

194
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:30,967
I haven't seen that face in so long.

195
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,718
Have you been well?

196
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:34,971
Whatever.

197
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:38,766
The meeting agenda really surprised me.

198
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,686
I didn't know
you would try to take that place.

199
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,230
I heard you worked overseas.

200
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,232
Are you back for the chairman position?

201
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,443
-What?
-Your dad's going to...

202
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:55,283
I heard he's going to pass away.

203
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,624
Was I too straightforward?

204
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:08,379
No, I'm just surprised you know already.

205
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:10,798
Why aren't you using that card?

206
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:15,261
Well, it's always nice to have
as many cards as I can.

207
00:16:19,223 --> 00:16:20,141
Right.

208
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,019
Are you free?

209
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:24,520
Why don't we go to Itaewon

210
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:26,981
and grab a drink?

211
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:30,985
Why would I drink with you?

212
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:33,446
Who knows?

213
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,074
I might get drunk
and tell you some company secrets.

214
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:42,455
It's always nice to have
as many cards as you can.

215
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:58,346
What's gotten into you?
I'm surprised you called me.

216
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,514
You're busy these days.

217
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,309
I had some free time.

218
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:05,811
How are you? Is everything the same?

219
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:08,981
No.

220
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,692
I bought a house.

221
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:14,403
Really?

222
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:16,113
That's amazing.

223
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:18,115
I don't own my own place yet.

224
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,660
Whatever. You're the CEO of IC Co.

225
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,204
It's only because
you spend all your money on stocks.

226
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:29,418
A nice car, a nice house,

227
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:32,713
and an independent and relaxed life...

228
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,466
They were my dreams
ever since I was young.

229
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:39,136
Your dream came true.

230
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:41,806
Yes.

231
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,767
I lived really diligently.

232
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,812
But something bothers me.

233
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:52,066
I feel a bit weird these days.

234
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:55,152
This is the kind of life
I've always wanted.

235
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,990
But I feel a little empty.

236
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:03,911
I feel so lethargic.

237
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:13,004
What about you?

238
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,006
What?

239
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,720
If the stockholders' meeting goes well,

240
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:25,224
does that mean I'll soon be able
to quit my job?

241
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:37,987
I guess?

242
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:42,241
I feel like the end is near.

243
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:48,664
You're rich, and you're very close
to achieving your goal.

244
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:51,542
What's next?

245
00:18:58,632 --> 00:18:59,884
Do you still like me?

246
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:09,351
Why the sudden question?
I've already said it so many times.

247
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:15,483
Tell me you like me.

248
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:19,987
What?

249
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:35,396
Don't go.

250
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:44,572
Do you like

251
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:47,241
Yi-seo?

252
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:56,709
-Soo-ah--
-It's been 15 years.

253
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:01,005
You...

254
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:04,633
You promised to make me quit my job.

255
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,971
You of all people

256
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:12,975
should still like me.

257
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:21,775
-You--
-You're right.

258
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:27,656
Everything you said is right, but...

259
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:35,164
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:43,172
I was kidding.

261
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:48,969
Tomorrow's the stockholders' meeting.
You should go talk to her.

262
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:51,263
Go on.

263
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,269
I'll call you again.

264
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:45,734
Why are you here?

265
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:51,740
When are you going to stop

266
00:22:52,616 --> 00:22:53,784
using Yi-seo like that?

267
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:58,831
What do you mean I'm using her?

268
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:01,458
You know how she feels.

269
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,961
Are you going to accept it?

270
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,052
You can't accept her feelings,

271
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:14,722
but you can't push her away.

272
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,266
I understand.

273
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:19,560
Yi-seo is a very important talent

274
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,937
to IC Co.

275
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:26,567
-Geun-soo--
-If IC Co. disappears,

276
00:23:29,987 --> 00:23:31,363
will you let go of Yi-seo?

277
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:39,621
I'll see you at the meeting.

278
00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:01,477
Soo-ah.

279
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:04,480
Soo-ah.

280
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:11,320
Geun-won.

281
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,710
I didn't know you got discharged.

282
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:29,838
Don't you still have
some time left in prison?

283
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:32,591
I escaped because I missed you.

284
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:34,885
What?

285
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:36,553
I'm kidding.

286
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:39,056
I was a model prisoner.

287
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:41,266
They let me out early.

288
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:43,936
It must've been tough.

289
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:53,445
What's your plan now?

290
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,614
Do you plan

291
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:57,741
to return to Jangga Co.?

292
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,994
No.

293
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:03,872
I need to do something else.

294
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,417
Something else?

295
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:12,423
Come to think of it,
this is our first time drinking together.

296
00:25:13,674 --> 00:25:15,300
We've known each other for years.

297
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:17,886
I guess today is a special day.

298
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,264
Thanks, Soo-ah.

299
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,474
You made my dream come true.

300
00:25:23,642 --> 00:25:25,144
-Geun-won.
-I know.

301
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:27,438
I'm not hitting on you.

302
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:32,693
I know I'm a jerk.

303
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,738
But I don't want to ruin the life
of the woman I like.

304
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:43,245
What's that supposed to mean?

305
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:48,417
Nothing.

306
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:51,920
Do you

307
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:55,549
still like Saeroyi?

308
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:05,517
You haven't changed at all.

309
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:10,189
No.

310
00:26:13,817 --> 00:26:15,402
I guess I'll always be

311
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,364
a horrible jerk to you.

312
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:23,243
What?

313
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,335
This looks nice. Try a bite.

314
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:43,722
You're home.

315
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:46,183
When did you come?

316
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:48,602
About five days ago.

317
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:52,272
I was just about to leave.

318
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:56,568
I'm going on a trip to Europe tomorrow.

319
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,862
I thought I'd drop by before I left.

320
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,283
I'm jealous.

321
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:05,410
Europe sounds nice.

322
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:09,248
Why didn't you come home?

323
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:10,791
Where have you been sleeping?

324
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,466
I was busy.

325
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,595
I went on business trips,

326
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,973
and I sometimes slept in the office.

327
00:27:28,183 --> 00:27:29,226
That's it?

328
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:33,313
I was hoping things might be
going well with your boss.

329
00:27:34,022 --> 00:27:35,732
I thought you didn't like him.

330
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,526
Well...

331
00:27:38,694 --> 00:27:41,488
Back then, he used to own a small pub.

332
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:43,240
You're so materialistic.

333
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:46,410
But I have to say,

334
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:49,663
nothing happened
between you two for years.

335
00:27:49,746 --> 00:27:52,457
Are you sure you really have a chance?

336
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:55,252
Yi-seo?

337
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:02,110
Boss, what are we going to do?

338
00:29:03,028 --> 00:29:03,904
What's the matter?

339
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:06,948
I think she has a cold or something.
She has a fever.

340
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:10,577
I'm okay.
Today's the stockholders' meeting.

341
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:13,830
I don't care if I have a cold. Let's go.

342
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,667
-Will you be okay?
-Yes.

343
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:27,177
Okay.

344
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:33,350
Ms. Kang and Ho-jin
will head straight to Jangga Co.

345
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:36,895
Did they receive a lot of voting rights?

346
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:39,231
-Gosh.
-Yi-seo!

347
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:40,774
Yi-seo.

348
00:29:40,857 --> 00:29:43,318
I knew this would happen
when she kept overworking herself.

349
00:29:43,402 --> 00:29:46,279
Call an ambulance. Hurry. Yi-seo.

350
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:47,614
Yi-seo, are you okay?

351
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,924
<i>Yi-seo collapsed.
We're on our way to the hospital.</i>

352
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:00,967
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

353
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,095
What's the matter?

354
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,890
Yi-seo apparently collapsed.

355
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:09,559
What?

356
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,227
What are we going to do?

357
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,105
She doesn't necessarily need to be there
since she won't be voting.

358
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,692
But what about Saeroyi?
He needs to be there.

359
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:18,985
Yes.

360
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,320
He's a major shareholder,
so his vote matters.

361
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,155
He needs to be there.

362
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,533
As you already know, he's...

363
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,753
There's an hour left
until the meeting, sir.

364
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,714
Do you feel okay?

365
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:43,968
Let's go.

366
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:48,014
JANGGA CO. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ELECTION
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

367
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,278
Long time no see, sir.

368
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,700
Yes.

369
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,953
I didn't know you were involved.

370
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:13,039
But then again,

371
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,958
you were never the obedient type

372
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:18,461
ever since you were young.

373
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,714
I heard about

374
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:23,883
your severe condition.

375
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,515
I'm sure it would've been a nice card.

376
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:33,935
But you didn't use it against me.

377
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:38,564
Because what matters to me is Jangga Co.

378
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,069
Yes, you're trying to invite an executive
from outside the company

379
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,738
instead of going public about my health.

380
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:50,034
And I'm sure you're doing all that
for the company.

381
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,494
I have no doubt about that.

382
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,079
-Sir--
-But the problem is,

383
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,916
you always make the wrong choice.

384
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,713
That punk is motivated by revenge,
so you should've discarded him by now.

385
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,133
You don't keep that kind of person on top.

386
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,516
Where is Saeroyi?

387
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,104
There he is.

388
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,901
What about Yi-seo?
Didn't she come with you?

389
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:27,822
She's not coming today.

390
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,034
How do you think it'll go today?

391
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,412
You heard what the chairman said.

392
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,205
You always

393
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,208
make the wrong choice, Ms. Kang.

394
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:41,460
What?

395
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,007
I'll see you later.

396
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,761
That rude little punk.

397
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,475
How is Yi-seo? Is she okay?

398
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:32,303
We will begin the stockholders’ meeting
regarding the appointment

399
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,930
of Ms. Jo Yi-seo as
a non-executive director.

400
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,189
-Yi-seo!
-Yi-seo.

401
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:48,986
How do you think it'll go?

402
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,197
How would I know?

403
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,532
I don't know how things work
with this kind of stuff.

404
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,328
So you don't care if we win or not?

405
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,497
Don't take it so negatively.

406
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,415
She worked so hard,
so it'd be great if we win.

407
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,751
But I just want her

408
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,670
to take a break once in a while.

409
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,186
The stockholders' meeting.

410
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,856
How did it go?

411
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:30,194
The proposal to appoint Ms. Jo Yi-seo
as a non-executive director

412
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,413
has been rejected.

413
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,960
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ELECTION
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

414
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:04,770
Our foreign branches?

415
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:08,732
If we gather the stockholders in the US,
that already exceeds ten percent.

416
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:11,861
But no one really has authority over them.
We should be more attentive.

417
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,239
So you're going to bring them to our side?

418
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,366
VOICE RECORDING

419
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,786
<i>Don't worry, Director Jang.</i>

420
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:24,540
<i>They know we're going to partner up
with All Food Market in LA.</i>

421
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,294
<i>So over 70 percent of the US stockholders
will give you their support.</i>

422
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,568
Like I said,

423
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,071
I can't wait for too long.

424
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,054
Today, let's focus
on calming the stockholders.

425
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,264
Saeroyi, cheer up.

426
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:27,478
Ms. Kang, I need to go to the hospital.

427
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,271
What? Oh, yes.

428
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:30,773
What do you mean? We--

429
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,024
Don't worry. You should go.

430
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,160
LIA NATIONAL HOSPITAL

431
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:46,872
Hey, over here.

432
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:47,915
-Is she in here?
-Yes.

433
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:52,836
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

434
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,381
I was busy running.

435
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,175
-How did it go?
-What about you? Are you okay?

436
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,094
She overworked herself.

437
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,888
Don't worry too much.
She'll be fine after she gets some rest.

438
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:04,765
Tell me how it went.

439
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,395
It got rejected.

440
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:14,483
Are you really okay?

441
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,861
I bet it was Geun-soo's doing.

442
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,281
He recently went to the overseas branches.

443
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:22,533
I guess he convinced
the stockholders there.

444
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:25,077
That damned vixen.

445
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,706
Don't worry.

446
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,625
-I have plan B.
-For now, you should--

447
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:34,795
I've been meeting
with the stockholders and directors.

448
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,171
What are you doing now?

449
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:40,175
A lot of them had complaints
even though they didn't speak out.

450
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:43,345
I will stir them all
with Chairman Jang's cancer.

451
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,140
Stop it.

452
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:50,978
Get some rest.

453
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,231
What are you talking about? I can't rest.

454
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,774
If you keep moving,

455
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,029
you'll be fired.

456
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:05,534
You guys watch Yi-seo.

457
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,578
If she moves, tell me immediately.

458
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,998
I'll just fire her.

459
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,001
Okay.

460
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:18,213
-Boss--
-Please.

461
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:20,049
Get some rest.

462
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:21,967
I'm begging you.

463
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,648
Boss.

464
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,403
Why are you here?
I told you to watch Yi-seo.

465
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,155
Hyun-yi is there.

466
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,282
I will look around the stores
instead of Yi-seo.

467
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,327
Okay.

468
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,916
Why do you look so down?

469
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,251
Is it because of the meeting?

470
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,544
Or is it about

471
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,171
Yi-seo?

472
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:01,757
What?

473
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,469
Things will go better
at the next stockholders' meeting.

474
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:06,804
And about Yi-seo,

475
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:09,390
you can just go after your heart.

476
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,228
What are you trying to say?

477
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,438
You know what I mean.

478
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,482
Yi-seo has feelings for you.

479
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,610
And you like Soo-ah.

480
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:28,200
Are you being confused?

481
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:32,955
You're being silly.

482
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,457
The age gap between Yi-seo and I...

483
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,628
Work, age gap, and all that.

484
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:42,005
They are just excuses.

485
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:43,841
If you don't like me,

486
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,677
that's just what it is.

487
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,683
Do you really need

488
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,643
excuses like that?

489
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:57,938
What about age?

490
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:00,691
It doesn't matter
even if people point fingers at you.

491
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,234
Your first love from ten years ago?

492
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:04,695
It's okay to hurt her feelings.

493
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,074
Why are you being so talkative?

494
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:11,201
I'm just saying.

495
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,496
This is really not like you.

496
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,583
I should get going then.

497
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,085
-See you.
-Bye.

498
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,376
<i>Look at this necklace.</i>

499
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,711
Isn't it so pretty?

500
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,270
I don't think he really meant it.

501
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:23,273
He just said
that because he cares about you.

502
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:26,276
No, I know that look on his face.

503
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,238
If I moved there,
I would've been fired right away.

504
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,367
It's all about timing.

505
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:37,412
This is not the time
for me to lie in bed like this.

506
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:40,624
Hyun-yi.

507
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,126
Will you cover up for me?

508
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,671
Gosh, no. I'd end up getting fired too.

509
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,339
What? Whose side are you on?

510
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,883
Don't be silly.
Of course, I'm on your side.

511
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:57,349
Saeroyi will take
care of the business in China.

512
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:00,185
And Seung-kwon will
take care of the stores.

513
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:02,938
Can't you trust them?

514
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,439
It's not like that.

515
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,150
Seung-kwon is better than me

516
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,070
when it comes to the stores.

517
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,614
Then why are you trying
to overwork yourself?

518
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:14,992
These days,

519
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,036
I keep telling Boss

520
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,497
that I love him.

521
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:25,294
That's not surprising.

522
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,880
If he thinks my feelings for him
are a reason for dismissal,

523
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,634
he should fire me, I said.

524
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,553
What's that?

525
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,638
The company can't run without you.

526
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,307
That's it.

527
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,435
The reason

528
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,730
I can show my affection like that

529
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:49,234
is because I am a competent employee

530
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,862
who's needed in the company.

531
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,658
Whatever I say,

532
00:42:57,326 --> 00:42:59,620
he needs to have me around him.

533
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:03,874
I have to be someone who he needs.

534
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,218
You fool.

535
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:17,512
Do you think he will fire you
if you are not good?

536
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:19,139
Would Saeroyi do that?

537
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,268
You've worked with him for years.
Do you still not know him?

538
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,645
I know.

539
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,774
I just need to justify my actions.

540
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,695
I need the right to say

541
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,573
that I love him.

542
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,239
I will be too busy to take care
of Jangmun Market Street for a while.

543
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,410
You are the only person
whom I can ask for a favor.

544
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,121
I should do as I'm told by the director.

545
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:25,580
Thank you.

546
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:30,544
By the way, things are a little
uneasy in the company these days.

547
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,923
The next chairman will be announced soon.

548
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,217
The next chairman?

549
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,427
Well...

550
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,930
I guess you should know that.

551
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:44,558
What's the matter?

552
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,478
Chairman Jang

553
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:53,692
has only a few months to live.

554
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,330
Geun-soo, that fool.

555
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,791
He didn't have to tell you.

556
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:13,962
I was going to tell you anyway.

557
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,800
Besides Mr. Kim,

558
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,929
you're the one who stayed with me
for the longest time.

559
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,435
But you had a different motive.

560
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:37,903
I know how you've felt
around me the whole time.

561
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,949
You resented me

562
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:45,869
for what happened to Mr. Park.

563
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:49,956
But you were afraid of me
at the same time.

564
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,211
Yes.

565
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:56,880
That's true.

566
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:01,551
Someone you hate is dying.

567
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,388
Isn't it a good thing?

568
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:08,934
Why

569
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:11,978
are you crying?

570
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,275
I don't know.

571
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,489
You fool.

572
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,117
I know

573
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,288
I've given you hard times with my orders.

574
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:33,375
You're a competent woman,

575
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,919
but you didn't leave your boss
whom you hate.

576
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,630
Do you know why?

577
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,467
I don't know.

578
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,555
It's servility.

579
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,100
You've been tamed

580
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,562
to my taste.

581
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:58,608
I pressured everyone around me

582
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:02,737
with power to tame them like that.

583
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,576
It's easy

584
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,453
to control them.

585
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,999
And I despise them.

586
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:22,048
Is that how you want me to feel about you

587
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,636
at the last moment of my life?

588
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,683
Why are you

589
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:36,521
telling me all that?

590
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,569
I don't know.

591
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:51,036
I'm literally close to death.

592
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,415
So I guess I'm being strange.

593
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,311
He's waiting.

594
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,691
Sir, your customer is here.

595
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,742
Gosh, welcome.

596
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:35,580
It's been a long time.

597
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,291
What we talked about before.

598
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:41,461
I'd like to start it.

599
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:53,014
When do we start?

600
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:02,732
Mr. Park, it's been a while.

601
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:05,902
Toni, why did you bring them?

602
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:08,738
Yi-seo is sick, so Seung-kwon called me.

603
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:11,992
That's a lot.

604
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:13,618
This is about half of it.

605
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:15,829
Yi-seo's drawer is locked,

606
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,664
so I didn't bring the files for China.

607
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,291
I don't know the password.
Shall I call her?

608
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,461
No. I know it. I'll take care of it.

609
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:29,426
Why are you lying down here?

610
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:31,052
I need to sign the proposals.

611
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,637
I'm doing this for Yi-seo.

612
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:36,266
It's locked.

613
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,517
I know the password.

614
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,436
Good. All the important
documents are in there.

615
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:40,437
What's the password?

616
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:43,690
What?

617
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:45,025
The password.

618
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,612
My birthday.

619
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,826
Gosh, she's so devoted.

620
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,331
What's the proposal for?

621
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,292
It's no big deal. It's about an event.

622
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,501
An event?

623
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,129
All right.

624
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,174
"With the person at DanBam".

625
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:11,885
"Whom do you hate the most this winter?"

626
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,512
"Come to DanBam with the person."

627
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:16,639
"You'll get free Ugly Duck <i>Bulgogi</i>."

628
00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:18,933
What's that?

629
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:21,311
We will hear their stories
and give out free dishes.

630
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:25,065
"Who's the first person
you want to thank?"

631
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:26,608
A person I want to thank?

632
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:27,776
For me,

633
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:29,569
of course, it's you.

634
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,204
<i>Someone I'm grateful to?</i>

635
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,082
Boss.

636
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:44,626
Boss, I recorded everything.

637
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:48,713
I recorded that bastard confessing
the murder of your father.

638
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:52,801
If we use this and involve the media,
the police may reinvestigate the case.

639
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:01,726
"Who's the first person
you want to apologize to?"

640
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,646
Don't like me.

641
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:22,539
"When was the scariest moment
that comes to your mind now?"

642
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:25,792
Yi-seo!

643
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,210
Yi-seo.

644
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:31,673
"What's the best luck in your life?"

645
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:35,552
I want to

646
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:37,679
work here.

647
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,641
I will

648
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,185
help you achieve your dream, Boss.

649
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,608
"Are you

650
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:54,070
in love with someone?"

651
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:52,629
<i>It's</i>

652
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,008
<i>all you.</i>

653
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:17,445
The reason
I can show my affection like that

654
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,781
is because I am a competent employee

655
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,659
who's needed in the company.

656
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,288
<i>Whatever I say,</i>

657
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,791
<i>he needs to have me around him.</i>

658
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,545
I have to be someone who he needs.

659
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:57,235
Jo Yi-seo. Where is she?

660
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,945
What's your relationship with her?

661
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:00,488
Her friend.

662
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,448
Jo Yi-seo...

663
00:54:04,701 --> 00:54:08,037
She refused to see anyone
other than family and authorized people.

664
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:09,414
What?

665
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:12,542
If you're a friend,
you should give her a call.

666
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:13,835
Well...

667
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,004
Geun-soo.

668
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,878
GET BETTER, FROM SAEROYI

669
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,046
<i>Get better.</i>

670
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:10,558
-Ms. Jo Yi-seo.
-Yes?

671
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:12,769
I'll get you an IV injection.

672
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:13,686
Okay.

673
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:20,360
About the non-executive director issue.

674
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:23,321
Is it okay if I don't feel bad about it?

675
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:24,655
Sure.

676
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:28,743
You totally got us.

677
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:29,952
I guess

678
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:32,288
you just did your job.

679
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,211
I knew you would say that.

680
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,004
Did you read articles about Yi-seo?

681
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:43,549
Yes.

682
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,469
And the next thing I know,

683
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:47,929
I'm here.

684
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,974
Do you

685
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,228
still like Yi-seo a lot?

686
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:02,652
It's been four years.

687
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:05,530
I've thought about her every single day.

688
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:07,490
You know it.

689
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:12,870
The reason I left DanBam.

690
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,125
The reason I want to take over Jangga Co.

691
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:20,670
The reason

692
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:24,715
I want to destroy IC Co.

693
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:27,552
It's all

694
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,058
because of Yi-seo.

695
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:40,440
I understand.

696
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,987
She's someone
whom you can bet your life on.

697
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,156
Yi-seo.

698
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:54,704
What?

699
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,376
She's a woman my friend loves.

700
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,755
I should give up
even if I have feelings for her.

701
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:08,718
A woman?

702
00:57:10,136 --> 00:57:11,387
It's a betrayal.

703
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:16,142
It's an awful thing to do.

704
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,065
Saeroyi.

705
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:40,875
I'm doing it now.

706
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,255
The betrayal.

707
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:48,633
The awful thing.

708
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:54,931
-What are you--
-You can curse at me if you want.

709
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:58,351
-If you punch me, I'll let you do it.
-What are you talking about?

710
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:06,943
I

711
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:11,739
like Yi-seo.

712
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,789
I won't apologize though.

713
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:39,433
PATIENT JO YI-SEO

714
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,810
Yi-seo.

715
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:08,671
Damn it!

716
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:17,638
You said you never had feelings for her.

717
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:19,432
Why did you change your mind?

718
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,725
What about Ms. Oh?

719
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,102
EUNMA-RO 29GIL PAJIN CITY
DON'T CALL ANYONE AND COME ALONE

720
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:24,228
Yi-seo.

721
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:07,313
What is going on?

722
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:39,159
Gosh, that was quick.

723
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:42,121
Where's Yi-seo?

724
01:00:44,748 --> 01:00:45,624
What's going on?

725
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,377
Where's Yi-seo? Why isn't she in her room?

726
01:00:49,044 --> 01:00:49,962
You...

727
01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:58,095
I feel so bad for my dad.

728
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:26,457
Jang Geun-won.

729
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:32,963
The two guys I hate are here together.

730
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:36,341
Where's Yi-seo?

731
01:01:37,634 --> 01:01:38,510
I don't know.

732
01:01:39,636 --> 01:01:41,680
Why do you even care
when you're about to die?

733
01:01:44,141 --> 01:01:46,059
Where's Yi-seo, you idiot?

734
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:24,348
Saeroyi!

735
01:02:30,896 --> 01:02:33,190
Saeroyi!

736
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:38,237
<i>Follow my heart</i>

737
01:02:39,863 --> 01:02:41,031
<i>and be myself.</i>

738
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:46,161
<i>A life without regrets</i>

739
01:02:46,912 --> 01:02:48,539
<i>regardless of consequences.</i>

740
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,711
<i>That's how I wanted to live.</i>

741
01:03:07,975 --> 01:03:09,601
<i>Have I been committed?</i>

742
01:03:25,492 --> 01:03:26,493
<i>Now</i>

743
01:03:27,953 --> 01:03:29,454
<i>I regret</i>

744
01:03:38,088 --> 01:03:39,756
<i>that day a lot.</i>

745
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:55,939
<i>Right now, I...</i>

746
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:00,694
<i>I love you.</i>

747
01:04:04,698 --> 01:04:06,408
I love you, Boss.

748
01:04:09,202 --> 01:04:10,454
I love you.

749
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:13,999
I really love you.

750
01:04:27,054 --> 01:04:28,889
<i>I miss you like crazy.</i>

751
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:39,691
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE?
BRING THEM TO DANBAM
