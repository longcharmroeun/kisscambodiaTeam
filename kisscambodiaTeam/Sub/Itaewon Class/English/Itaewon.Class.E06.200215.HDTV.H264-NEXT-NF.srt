EPISODE 6

5
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:21,879
Why are you having a hard time?

6
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:28,010
Don't be like that.

7
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:32,431
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

8
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,150
Be

9
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:45,110
a good girl.

10
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:55,663
<i>Even as we were parting,</i>

11
00:00:58,582 --> 00:00:59,750
<i>she didn't say</i>

12
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,045
<i>she'd come back for me.</i>

13
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:06,966
-Did you hear about Soo-ah?
-What?

14
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,427
She lives at Gaenari Orphanage.
It's close to my place, you know.

15
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,388
I saw her walking out of the orphanage.

16
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,681
What does that mean?

17
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,766
Is she really an orphan?

18
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:18,352
My gosh. Her parents abandoned her?

19
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:20,729
I pity her.

20
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:26,402
Soo-ah, do you want this?

21
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:30,781
OH SOO-AH

22
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:34,952
You're really giving this to me?
I'm hungry, so this is perfect.

23
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:37,413
I have milk too.

24
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:43,586
You're the best.

25
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:46,547
CHOI GYEONG-HUI

26
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:02,938
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

27
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:06,358
-It wasn't me.
-During the PE class,

28
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,485
everyone was on the schoolyard
except for you.

29
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,654
I was feeling sick,
so I went to the infirmary.

30
00:02:13,157 --> 00:02:14,825
The other kids told me

31
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,995
that Gyeong-hui
was always very good to you.

32
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:21,916
She was good to me?

33
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,126
Like giving change to homeless people?

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,546
-What?
-Why even you won't believe me?

35
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,673
Because I'm an orphan?

36
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,218
Forget it.

37
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:34,803
You may leave.

38
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:38,682
I'll be off, then.

39
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:42,144
You've lost your chance.

40
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:44,980
A chance to reflect and repent.

41
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:49,026
I don't need

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,236
such a chance.

43
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:09,922
<i>Seventeen is a young age.</i>

44
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:14,677
<i>A pitiful girl
whom even her own parents abandoned.</i>

45
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:17,179
<i>I thought,</i>

46
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,893
<i>"At least I should cherish myself."</i>

47
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:29,692
<i>A poor little girl
who was never loved by anyone.</i>

48
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:33,112
<i>I thought,</i>

49
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:35,322
<i>"At least I should love myself."</i>

50
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:39,994
Our company runs a foundation.

51
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:44,581
We'd like to pay for your admission fee
and living expenses.

52
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,834
What do you think?

53
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,546
<i>After that day, I keep justifying myself.</i>

54
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:52,756
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:54,925
<i>It would've been much better</i>

56
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,429
<i>to get bashed</i>

57
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:02,599
<i>for betraying someone I'm indebted to</i>

58
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:04,768
<i>or for turning against a friend.</i>

59
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:08,939
You just tried your best for your life.

60
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,442
You didn't do anything wrong.

61
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,069
The thing is...

62
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:17,573
Sae-ro-yi.

63
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:20,659
Go ahead.

64
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,208
To me...

65
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,544
you are...

66
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,013
<i>shining</i>

67
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:45,934
<i>too much.</i>

68
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,755
<i>Defense.</i>

69
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:17,508
Criminal Law Article 32.

70
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:20,677
Yi-seo.

71
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:22,763
A kiss without consent of the opposition

72
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:24,598
is an indecent assault.

73
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,902
Yi-seo, what are you doing?

74
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,112
Gosh.

75
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,239
Am I interrupting?

76
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:43,826
Do you give her consent to kiss you?

77
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:50,624
You punk.

78
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,043
That totally sobered me up.

79
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:56,171
Everyone's waiting.

80
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,090
It's our first team dinner
after we reopened.

81
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:59,758
You need to be there as our boss.

82
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,638
Go on in.
I'll call her a taxi and head inside.

83
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:07,391
It's okay. Don't worry.

84
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,143
I'll call a taxi for her.

85
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,855
Where do you live?

86
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,238
I asked you where you live.

87
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,118
I said, it's fine.

88
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,164
You have a team dinner?

89
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:32,249
Yes.

90
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:35,377
I drank on an empty stomach,
so I could use some food now.

91
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,045
Can I join you guys?

92
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,341
What?

93
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:44,678
What's she talking about?
It's our team dinner.

94
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:48,432
I asked your boss, not you.

95
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,021
Can I?

96
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:00,110
No?

97
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:22,674
All right. This needs to be shaken first.

98
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,760
Like this.

99
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,641
-Sae-ro-yi, let me pour you one.
-Sure.

100
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,227
You worked so hard today.

101
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:43,111
I'm not sure if it's okay for me
to join you guys like this.

102
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:47,783
You insisted on joining us.
Why wonder that now?

103
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:53,163
You're our boss' friend,
so you're more than welcome to join us.

104
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:54,289
Let's give her a big hand.

105
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,836
-Jeez.
-Thank you.

106
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:03,590
I think I saw you in the area
a little while ago.

107
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:06,927
Right. I work at Jangga Pub.

108
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:12,683
You look familiar too.

109
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:14,768
Oh, yes.

110
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,562
Last year, at the entrance...

111
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:20,065
Right, that minor!

112
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:24,403
You little punks. You tried
getting into a bunch of bars, I see.

113
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:25,988
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,156
Didn't we meet before that?

115
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,659
Even back then,
I thought you looked familiar.

116
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,121
I'm not sure.

117
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:42,713
This meat dish is so good.

118
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:44,464
Yes, it's delicious. What is this?

119
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,925
Fried pork belly.
Eat the meat with chives.

120
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,343
It'll taste even better.

121
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,389
-What do you think, Hyun-yi?
-It's good.

122
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:55,183
This restaurant is good.
I posted about it on my blog.

123
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,519
I gave it four stars.

124
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:59,855
Four stars from you?
That means it's really good.

125
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:03,900
What about DanBam?

126
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:06,903
How many stars do we get?

127
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:09,573
DanBam?

128
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,542
-Three.
-Three stars?

129
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,877
Seriously? That's it?

130
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,214
Three stars means
it’s a pretty decent pub.

131
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,342
Interesting.

132
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:32,721
Then is there a place in Itaewon
that deserves five stars?

133
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:36,850
Yes, there is.

134
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:46,651
Jangga Pub.

135
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,281
Location, service, and interior.

136
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:54,493
Everything about it is perfect.
But the best thing of all

137
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:57,037
is the taste.

138
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:00,457
I heard the chairman
made the recipes himself.

139
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:06,463
He really is amazing.

140
00:10:09,883 --> 00:10:11,676
Hyun-yi will become just as good.

141
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:15,722
-What?
-Don't get me wrong.

142
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,141
Hyun-yi's already a good cook.

143
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:22,020
But Jangga Co. is a huge corporation
with over ten successful brands.

144
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,898
Their business is so much bigger,
and we have different goals.

145
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:29,027
No, we don't.

146
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:33,031
My goal is to franchise DanBam.

147
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:43,625
You don't become a franchise
just by expanding your business.

148
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,627
I never expected it to be easy.

149
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,338
I don't mind the hurdles.

150
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:51,133
It might not be easy on my own,

151
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:53,510
but I have you guys.

152
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:57,055
We can do it. I know it for sure.

153
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:07,065
You don't think you have a chance because
you're a poor, undereducated ex-con?

154
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,110
You can't do anything
if you believe that is the case.

155
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:12,028
Why not decide after trying?

156
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:17,409
He's right. If he thinks we can do it,
then we can do it.

157
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,955
Yes, we can franchise the pub
and do anything we want.

158
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:23,415
I'll work five times...

159
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,208
No, I'll work ten times harder.

160
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,336
Then I guess we should trust him
and give it a go.

161
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:41,433
We can...

162
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:42,809
-Do it!
-Do it!

163
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,204
<i>You never say what I don't want to hear.</i>

164
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:03,538
It is time for action,

165
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,376
not words.

166
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:16,760
Why did you lie?

167
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:18,470
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:20,722
I heard you weren't the one

169
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,683
who got his business suspended.

170
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:33,652
And I can't believe
you tried to kiss him earlier.

171
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,993
Yes, you were impudent enough
to get in the way.

172
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,958
Why do you care?
I thought you didn't like Sae-ro-yi.

173
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:55,757
I like him a lot.

174
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:02,138
Really? Good luck.

175
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,976
I'm a little twisted,

176
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,688
so I even received counseling
back when I was in middle school.

177
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:14,067
-What?
-The doctor told me

178
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:17,946
there's a 79 percent probability
that I might be a sociopath.

179
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,534
So what?

180
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:25,203
Are you trying to tell me

181
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,330
that you're a psycho?

182
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,210
Here's my point.

183
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:36,423
There are people who must get
what they want no matter what.

184
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,718
If anyone gets in the way,

185
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:42,262
they do everything they can
to destroy that person.

186
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,556
I'm like that.

187
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,309
-So what--
-Let me...

188
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:49,978
Let me

189
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:53,273
paraphrase it for you.

190
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:58,194
I like my boss.

191
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:03,617
Okay.

192
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,330
But that's too bad.

193
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,457
Like I told you before,

194
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,793
Sae-ro-yi likes me.

195
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:18,548
You know that, right?

196
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:23,094
Then that leaves me with no choice.

197
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,391
I'll just have to

198
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:30,727
destroy you.

199
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:41,488
Good luck.

200
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:43,865
Cutie.

201
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:02,842
Are you Seo Jeong-in from Jea Foods?

202
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,887
Yes, you must be Jang Geun-won.

203
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,348
Yes, I'm sorry I'm late.
There was traffic.

204
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:09,974
It's okay.

205
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,562
I already ordered before you came.
Is that okay?

206
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:15,480
Yes.

207
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:20,985
Is this your first time?

208
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,323
-Sorry?
-You seem uncomfortable.

209
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,118
Either that or you don't like me.

210
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:33,331
Why wouldn't I like you?
Jea Foods is an amazing company.

211
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:40,964
Here's your food.

212
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:54,102
You should try it.
It's French roast chicken.

213
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:55,603
It's good.

214
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,700
I don't really like chicken.

215
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:13,455
That's funny.

216
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,916
I can't believe the eldest son
of the biggest food company in Korea

217
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,293
doesn't like chicken.

218
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:24,048
-Can you give us the menu?
-Sure.

219
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:30,680
-Sir.
-Give me a minute.

220
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,896
Sir.

221
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,399
-What is it?
-About this family photo...

222
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,154
The guy standing next to you...
Is he your son?

223
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:49,157
He's my second son.

224
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:52,452
By any chance,

225
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:56,581
did you make him work there
because of Sae-ro-yi?

226
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:01,044
What do you mean?

227
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:03,755
Make him work where?

228
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:05,840
Your second son.

229
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,093
Why is he working at DanBam?

230
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:12,555
What?

231
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:22,732
Are you saying

232
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,985
Geun-soo is working for Park Sae-ro-yi?

233
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,279
Yes.

234
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:32,116
I'm sorry. I guess you didn't know.

235
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:41,084
How is his pub doing these days?

236
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:43,253
It's doing well.

237
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,090
People even wait in line these days.
The business is growing rapidly.

238
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:50,885
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

239
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,720
<i>Director Jang Geun-won is here, sir.</i>

240
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:54,806
Tell him to come in. Bring us some tea.

241
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:00,353
His business is doing well?

242
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:02,605
Why?

243
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:10,738
-I'll come back.
-Don't bother.

244
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,241
How did the blind date go?

245
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:19,747
Nothing happened.

246
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:24,252
Sit down. I want you to hear this too.

247
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,757
Seriously. Nothing happened.

248
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,480
JO YI-SEO

249
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:46,232
Her name is Jo Yi-seo.

250
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:48,985
Jo Yi-seo? What is this about?

251
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:52,071
DanBam.

252
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:53,823
She's 20 years old?

253
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,325
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:58,620
What would a 20-year-old know?

255
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,622
You think his pub is doing well

256
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:02,790
because of her?

257
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,709
Yes, sir.

258
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:07,045
She's an Internet celebrity
and a famous power blogger.

259
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:09,172
Her marketing is very effective.

260
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,841
She may be young,
but she knows the market trend,

261
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:13,384
and she has great judgment.

262
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,762
She's quick-witted and sharp judgment?

263
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:17,931
Interesting.

264
00:19:18,806 --> 00:19:19,641
Pardon?

265
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:21,976
That's what I think of you.

266
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:27,315
Thank you, sir.

267
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,568
Then what's your opinion

268
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,655
on Park Sae-ro-yi?

269
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:46,250
In my opinion, Sae-ro-yi

270
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:50,046
is rash and foolish.

271
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,342
He was always like that.

272
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,386
People rarely change.

273
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,305
He's soft

274
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:01,724
yet sturdy.

275
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:09,273
A normal person wouldn't hire
a 20-year-old as a manager.

276
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,068
But the results are great,

277
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:14,028
and he has good insight.

278
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:16,864
Once he sets a goal,

279
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,910
he makes it happen
although it may take some time.

280
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:25,623
And his employees trust him a lot
because of his honesty and tolerance.

281
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,794
You're overestimating him.

282
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:33,673
How many employees does he have?
Four? Five?

283
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,925
If he can't manage that many people,
he'd be a fool.

284
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:42,432
Why do you even care about that tiny pub?

285
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:44,809
Our company also started out
as a small street pub.

286
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,564
A person with a clear goal
can achieve many things.

287
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,357
Go on.

288
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:55,862
Sae-ro-yi's goal right now

289
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:05,246
is to franchise his current pub, DanBam.

290
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,834
"Franchise"?

291
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,047
He must be crazy.

292
00:21:19,552 --> 00:21:20,553
Let's stop here.

293
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:22,972
Continue to keep an eye on his pub.

294
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,766
Yes, sir.

295
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:34,108
<i>The chairman asked Ms. Oh
to keep an eye on DanBam,</i>

296
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,278
<i>a pub that's owned by a guy
named Park Sae-ro-yi.</i>

297
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:39,113
"Park Sae-ro-yi."

298
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:46,621
"DanBam."

299
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:50,374
MANAGER, JO JEONG-MIN

300
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,797
Ms. Jo, didn't you say your daughter
got accepted to Sungyoon University?

301
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,924
Yes, she got in with the highest grades.

302
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:01,219
Then I guess she's just working part-time.

303
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:02,720
What do you mean?

304
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:05,014
Look. This is Yi-seo.

305
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,146
THANK YOU FOR VISITING DANBAM

306
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,024
TOMORROW, WE'LL COME BACK
WITH EVEN BETTER FOOD AND SERVICE

307
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:21,072
Thank you.

308
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:24,951
What? You want my number?

309
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:28,746
Yes, your number. Can I have your number?

310
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,249
I'm sorry.

311
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:39,674
Please?

312
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:43,886
I'm sorry. I like some already.

313
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:47,098
How much did we make in total?

314
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:48,724
36,200,000 won.

315
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,352
That's not too bad.

316
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:53,437
It's all thanks to you.

317
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:56,107
I want to do better.

318
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:58,901
What do you think about the idea
I suggested last time?

319
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:00,695
-Appearing on TV?
-Yes.

320
00:23:01,195 --> 00:23:03,573
But we might not get picked
just because we apply.

321
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:06,951
You said it'll be the most effective
marketing strategy, so let's do it.

322
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:08,202
Okay.

323
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:12,373
Don't go back on your word
once we start doing well.

324
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,377
-What are you talking about?
-The terms of my employment.

325
00:23:17,044 --> 00:23:20,506
You promised me 20 percent of net sales
instead of a monthly paycheck.

326
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,219
We were running on a loss before you came.

327
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:28,472
I was going to pay you
even if we didn't make any profit.

328
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:29,515
So it's for the better.

329
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:35,062
We're running short on manpower
with all the customers we've been getting.

330
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:39,275
We need an extra kitchen assistant
and a server during the weekends.

331
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:42,820
-Okay.
-I'll post the job opening online.

332
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:01,797
What? Why are you still up?

333
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:06,510
Have you been up all along,
or did you just wake up?

334
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,013
I called the admissions office.

335
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:14,936
They told me you didn't complete
your enrollment.

336
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:18,648
Why are you working part-time
instead of completing your enrollment?

337
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,276
-Mom.
-What are you thinking?

338
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,154
Are you trying to apply for Harvard again?

339
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:26,948
I'm a manager there.

340
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:30,243
-What?
-I got hired as a manger.

341
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:31,494
That's what I don't get!

342
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:38,251
Why would you work there
instead of going to university?

343
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:39,710
Why?

344
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,421
By any chance,

345
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:45,633
is this regarding
what you mentioned last time?

346
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,178
Do you like someone? Does he work there?

347
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:50,221
Yes.

348
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,681
He's the owner.

349
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:04,026
-What's that?
-I know.

350
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,028
You already made a choice,

351
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:09,573
so I know I can't make you
change your mind.

352
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:13,327
I packed your stuff.

353
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:15,621
I want you out of here.

354
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:19,875
Mom.

355
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:23,462
I only wanted you to hear

356
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:27,550
and see good things.

357
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:29,844
But

358
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:33,723
I was born poor,
and I have nothing to give you.

359
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,309
So I did everything I could
to raise you well.

360
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:41,731
Mom.

361
00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:43,482
But

362
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:46,777
you were so clever

363
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,615
and extremely smart,
so I figured you'd never end up like me.

364
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:55,786
Of all the traits you could take after,
why does it have to be this one?

365
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:59,373
-Don't you know what I had to go through?
-I'm not like you.

366
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,753
-What?
-I'm smart and clever.

367
00:26:05,254 --> 00:26:06,756
-What?
-I can achieve

368
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,676
both love and success.

369
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:14,347
So your goal

370
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:17,892
is to help that owner with his business?

371
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:18,976
Then what?

372
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,853
Will you become a pub owner's wife?

373
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,396
That's not how I was raised.

374
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:26,192
I'm not depending on someone else's dream.

375
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:28,944
And I'm not going to live
your dream either.

376
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:30,905
I'm going to live for myself.

377
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:33,240
It's my life.

378
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,703
-Yi-seo.
-Thank you

379
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:39,413
for raising me so well.

380
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:42,208
I won't take too long.

381
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:45,002
I'm a lot more competent than you think.

382
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:53,302
I'll be off now.

383
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:55,596
Feel sad just for a little while.

384
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:21,831
Yi-seo.

385
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:27,795
You got off work a while ago.
What are you doing here?

386
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,006
I was thinking about you.

387
00:27:31,924 --> 00:27:32,925
What?

388
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:38,431
What about you?
Why are you jogging here all of sudden?

389
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:40,307
Jogging is my hobby.

390
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:43,394
This is a great course to jog.

391
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:53,279
Did something happen?

392
00:27:54,697 --> 00:27:55,865
I made my mom cry.

393
00:27:58,576 --> 00:27:59,785
Why?

394
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,747
Because I refused to live
the way she wanted me to live.

395
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,335
She wanted me to go to a good university,
get a job at a big firm,

396
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,463
and marry a guy from a decent family.

397
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,716
I guess she didn't like what I was doing.

398
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,555
Geun-soo did tell me

399
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:23,934
that you're working at the pub
instead of going to university.

400
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,438
Why didn't you stop me?

401
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:36,113
Let me guess.

402
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,449
You wanted to respect my choice
because it's my life?

403
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:43,621
No.

404
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:48,375
Because I need you.

405
00:28:58,802 --> 00:29:00,679
If your mother wants you to get a job

406
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:03,349
at a big firm,

407
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:10,147
maybe DanBam could
eventually grow into one.

408
00:29:16,695 --> 00:29:18,280
Am I being too selfish?

409
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:20,741
I haven't

410
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:24,954
really consoled anyone before.

411
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:31,961
That just consoled me

412
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:34,255
more than anything.

413
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:39,260
But I'm a little surprised.

414
00:29:39,343 --> 00:29:42,221
I didn't know you'd be brazen enough
to say something like that.

415
00:29:44,557 --> 00:29:45,516
Well,

416
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,643
I have you.

417
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:56,318
During our team dinner,
you said you want DanBam

418
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,781
to grow into a bigger franchise
than Jangga Co.

419
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:03,993
-Yes.
-That means

420
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:07,079
you want to be the best
in the food business.

421
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:11,834
I'll make it happen.

422
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:21,135
They say, "The bigger you dream,
the bigger you'll grow."

423
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:24,096
You're a man of your word, right?

424
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:29,518
You're not full of bullshit, right?

425
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:32,146
Bull...

426
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:34,231
Bull... What?

427
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,153
Let's make it happen together.

428
00:30:41,822 --> 00:30:42,656
Okay.

429
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:21,028
<i>You look prettier with black hair.</i>

430
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,780
<i>Sis.</i>

431
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:26,825
DANBAM NATIONAL GYMNASTICS

432
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,164
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-<i>Ready...</i>

433
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:34,958
-What?
-You did your hair?

434
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:37,628
Oh, my hair...

435
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:40,214
Gosh, I almost didn't recognize you.

436
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:43,550
I told you that you look better
with black hair.

437
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:45,177
It's pretty.

438
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:48,722
It really is pretty. Don't you agree?

439
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:51,809
What? Yes, I guess.

440
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:55,312
It looks good on you.

441
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:07,157
<i>By any chance,</i>

442
00:32:07,574 --> 00:32:10,744
<i>did you make him work there
because of Sae-ro-yi?</i>

443
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:12,705
Park Sae-ro-yi.

444
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,625
How peculiar.

445
00:32:18,627 --> 00:32:20,963
I'm so bothered by him for some reason.

446
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:28,262
GUBGOO

447
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,097
APPLICANTS

448
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,849
We have so many applicants.

449
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:35,894
-This is going to take longer than a day.
-Why?

450
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,608
You applied for the part-time job?

451
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:43,652
Yes, sir.

452
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:47,781
I'm a huge fan, Ms. Jo.

453
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,826
Out.

454
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:53,412
Okay.

455
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:55,456
I don't like any of the applicants.

456
00:33:12,014 --> 00:33:14,808
I saw a job opening online.

457
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,561
-Are you still hiring?
-My gosh, you pass.

458
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:19,688
-What?
-What?

459
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:20,689
I mean...

460
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,275
Yes, you're hired.

461
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:24,818
I mean, we're hiring. Sae-ro-yi.

462
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,696
End of interview.

463
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:30,866
Hey, you're...

464
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,868
Hello.

465
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:41,794
She used to work at Seok-cheon's pub.

466
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:44,379
Why did you quit?

467
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:46,507
I'll be going back to school soon.

468
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:49,885
I don't have time to work full-time,
so I'm searching for a part-time job.

469
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:55,557
I promise I'll work really hard.
Please hire me, Sae-ro-yi.

470
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:00,229
We'd love to--

471
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:02,981
You'll hear the results via text.

472
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:04,733
What?

473
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:08,153
Oh, okay. You can text me.

474
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:10,447
I'll be waiting, Sae-ro-yi.

475
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:11,907
Okay, I'll see you again.

476
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:22,125
-Not hired.
-What?

477
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:26,255
-What?
-Why? Why not?

478
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:28,131
My gut tells me so.

479
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:30,259
What kind of gut is that?

480
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:32,761
Sae-ro-yi, no one else is prettier...

481
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:37,432
I mean, no one's better than her.

482
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:39,685
Yi-seo, what's wrong with you?

483
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:42,521
What kind of person do you want?

484
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:53,907
Just hire her. She's nice.

485
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:57,160
-Sixty-seven...
-Will you please just hire her?

486
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,121
What do you know about her?

487
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:09,673
We're not open yet,
but I don't speak English.

488
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,009
I'm sorry. We're not open yet.

489
00:35:12,092 --> 00:35:13,510
Can you come at 5pm?

490
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:15,429
What?

491
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:17,723
Are you the owner?

492
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:22,102
May I help you?

493
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:27,441
I'm here for an interview
for the server position.

494
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,699
Your name is Tony?

495
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:37,743
Yes, it's Kim Tony.

496
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:39,620
How long have you been in Korea?

497
00:35:39,703 --> 00:35:40,996
I've been here for a year.

498
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,040
You're Korean is very good.

499
00:35:43,123 --> 00:35:46,293
I'm Korean. My dad is Korean.

500
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:52,341
Have you ever worked as a server at a pub?

501
00:35:52,424 --> 00:35:54,009
No, I haven't.

502
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:01,350
-What do you think?
-Him?

503
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:04,853
I never even thought
of hiring a foreigner.

504
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:08,148
-Do you think Sae-ro-yi will hire him?
-Yi-seo won't hire him.

505
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:09,733
I'm not sure.

506
00:36:11,193 --> 00:36:12,235
She actually might...

507
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:13,820
Let's hire him.

508
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,617
-What?
-We need to work with him

509
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,619
to see if he’s a hard worker or not.

510
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:24,164
But we're in Itaewon, and I'm the only one
who can speak English.

511
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:26,041
It's a good thing.

512
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:28,335
It'll be nice to have a foreigner around.

513
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:30,504
But I'm Korean.

514
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,590
Right. Okay.

515
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,426
Can you start tomorrow?

516
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:38,553
Yes, cool.

517
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:41,890
-What?
-I can start tomorrow.

518
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:44,059
Oh, cool.

519
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:49,147
We'll be working together,
so is it okay if I talk more comfortably?

520
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:51,108
Sure, cool.

521
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:52,943
Cool.

522
00:36:59,157 --> 00:37:00,701
-Hello.
-Hi.

523
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:02,703
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

524
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:04,496
-Hello.
-Hello.

525
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,960
Hello, sir.

526
00:37:10,377 --> 00:37:12,921
There are a lot of customers.
Your sales increased.

527
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,632
Yes, Ms. Oh is helping us out a lot.

528
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:19,136
Don't lie to me. I can already imagine
how difficult she must be.

529
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,724
You should've done well
while I was in charge.

530
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:25,183
My goodness.

531
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,811
But what brings you here all of a sudden?

532
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,815
Shouldn't Ms. Oh be here by now?

533
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:36,945
-We checked everything, and it's fine.
-Okay.

534
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:38,905
Put that box inside.

535
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,200
-We'll be off now.
-Thank you.

536
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:43,285
Bye.

537
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:48,123
Don't you think
I should get paid for this?

538
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:50,500
Here.

539
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:54,588
Why did you move out all of a sudden?

540
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,965
I got caught working
instead of going to university.

541
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:00,469
What?

542
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:02,262
Did you get kicked out?

543
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:05,432
Hang on.

544
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,019
Hello?

545
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:10,270
How have you been, sir?

546
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:12,564
I've been doing well.

547
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:14,775
Did you check my proposal?

548
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:17,235
Oh, really?

549
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:20,197
Thank you so much.

550
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:22,365
That's great.

551
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:24,201
Sure.

552
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:26,536
Our pub is really popular in Itaewon.

553
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,955
I wouldn't work here for no reason.

554
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:31,625
All right. Okay.

555
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,294
Thank you, Director.

556
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:37,339
It's done.

557
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:39,216
Director?
Was it from a broadcasting company?

558
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:40,509
Hang on.

559
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:44,805
Boss.

560
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:49,476
I finally got our pub
introduced in a TV show.

561
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:57,109
Did you see my proposal?
It sounds great, doesn't it?

562
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:00,862
Where are you?

563
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:04,825
Oh, okay. They want to see you
at the company tomorrow.

564
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:09,079
Really?

565
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:12,457
That's great. Okay. I'll be right there.

566
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:16,211
Hey.

567
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,089
Hey, Soo-ah.

568
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:20,757
Something good must be happening.

569
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:24,845
Our pub will be introduced
in a TV show called <i>The Best Pub</i>.

570
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:26,721
<i>The Best Pub?</i>

571
00:39:27,347 --> 00:39:28,890
The cooking competition show?

572
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:32,018
Yes. You know it. I heard it's a new show.

573
00:39:32,102 --> 00:39:35,147
I see. So you managed
to clinch the deal somehow.

574
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,524
I heard they are
mostly franchise restaurants.

575
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,110
Yi-seo did a good job.

576
00:39:46,074 --> 00:39:48,410
Did you go home safely that night?

577
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,538
I'm sorry.

578
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:53,623
I got drunk and made a scene.

579
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,292
What?

580
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:57,460
It's nothing.

581
00:39:58,003 --> 00:40:00,380
Thanks to you, I feel much better now.

582
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:02,841
What?

583
00:40:08,054 --> 00:40:09,347
You told me.

584
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:13,101
That I'm just trying my best for my life.

585
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,104
I did.

586
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:19,774
Sae-ro-yi.

587
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:24,279
I will keep on

588
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:28,325
living my life to the fullest.

589
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:33,413
I've lived as an employee of Jangga.

590
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:35,832
And I will continue to do so.

591
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:40,378
Soo-ah.

592
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:48,428
Thank you for what you've done for me.

593
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,475
You seriously shouldn't

594
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:57,854
like me anymore.

595
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:29,386
What will you do about Park Sae-ro-yi?

596
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:31,137
What do you mean?

597
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:33,139
He's been annoying lately.

598
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:35,809
Do you want me to do something?

599
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:41,106
He's an ex-convict who got expelled
from school and lost his dad.

600
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,441
He could've caved in,

601
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,027
but he's doing just fine.

602
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,155
You said those with determined goals
are hard to deal with.

603
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:50,573
Right.

604
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:55,203
He might even start a brand
named DanBam someday.

605
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:56,579
My point.

606
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:59,457
-So before he poses a threat--
-And it's just that.

607
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:02,377
What?

608
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,129
You work to make money.

609
00:42:05,547 --> 00:42:07,465
That's what anyone can do.

610
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:14,097
But there's the next level.

611
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,100
The next level?

612
00:42:17,183 --> 00:42:18,601
You should let things

613
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,104
make money without working.

614
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:25,567
You could build such systems or invest.

615
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,361
There are a lot of ways.

616
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,612
And it's your way of thinking

617
00:42:30,363 --> 00:42:32,657
where the difference comes from.

618
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:35,910
So he worked diligently and constantly.

619
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:38,538
It's a big deal only to ordinary people.

620
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,583
Ten years is a long time.

621
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:46,755
What he's achieved with a solid goal
for ten years is just one pub.

622
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:49,549
There's no way

623
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:52,802
he will pose a threat to us.

624
00:42:58,183 --> 00:43:00,226
Then why are you so bothered about him?

625
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,859
So you're interested in Ms. Oh.

626
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:16,701
I think she's well worthwhile.

627
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:20,288
Are...

628
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:23,333
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

629
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:26,836
If you can make her marry into our family,

630
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:29,047
I won't tell you
to have an arranged marriage.

631
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:36,721
But what does Park Sae-ro-yi
have to do with Soo-ah?

632
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,850
He's like an assessor.

633
00:43:41,893 --> 00:43:42,769
What?

634
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:46,398
An assessor that I'm using
to see if Ms. Oh is one of my people.

635
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:48,983
That's it.

636
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:55,615
An assessor...

637
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:00,245
He's just an assessor.

638
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,039
An assessor, right?

639
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,584
I'm sorry.

640
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:26,062
PROGRAM NAME
<i>THE BEST PUB</i>

641
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,443
-Hello.
-Hello.

642
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:33,027
Are you the owner of Danbam?

643
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:34,237
Yes.

644
00:44:43,663 --> 00:44:45,540
You said there'd be another team.

645
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:47,417
Was it his pub?

646
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:50,753
Do you two know each other?

647
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:55,425
There are a lot
of distinguished brands out there.

648
00:44:56,009 --> 00:44:57,760
A small store like his

649
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:00,555
will only weigh down the show.

650
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:04,726
It's not like you two are arch enemies.

651
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:06,728
We are enemies.

652
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:08,438
Oh, well...

653
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:09,355
Please have a seat.

654
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:30,292
Have you been doing well?

655
00:45:32,085 --> 00:45:34,171
Soo-ah and you looked
good together the other day.

656
00:45:36,423 --> 00:45:37,257
What?

657
00:45:37,924 --> 00:45:40,469
You were with her at Itaewon.
So ten years...

658
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:47,142
You've stayed in touch
with her for ten years, right?

659
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:50,604
What's the deal between you two?

660
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,736
Did you know I'm interested in Soo-ah?

661
00:45:59,404 --> 00:46:02,783
Considering her background
and my social position,

662
00:46:03,366 --> 00:46:05,577
I didn't plan to marry her.

663
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:10,957
But unfortunately,
my father likes her too.

664
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,294
He says she's well worthwhile.

665
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,428
I guess she talked to you
out of pity a few times.

666
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:25,305
So did you fall for her?

667
00:46:27,516 --> 00:46:31,478
Isn't it obvious?
She just did it out of pity.

668
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:35,941
Think about it. Would she want
to marry the son of Jangga

669
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:40,153
or date an ex-con
who barely finished middle school?

670
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:45,534
I don't know.

671
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:49,037
But I'm sure she wouldn't want a murderer.

672
00:46:55,752 --> 00:46:56,920
Are you intimidated

673
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:00,090
by an ex-con who barely
finished middle school?

674
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:06,346
My gosh.

675
00:47:07,097 --> 00:47:10,100
What else did my father say?
He talked about you.

676
00:47:11,852 --> 00:47:14,229
You've worked so hard for ten years,

677
00:47:14,437 --> 00:47:16,439
but all you have achieved
is opening a tiny pub.

678
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:19,985
He said you'd never be a threat to us.

679
00:47:21,152 --> 00:47:22,571
"Park Sae-ro-yi

680
00:47:23,905 --> 00:47:26,616
is just like an assessor
to check up on Soo-ah's mind."

681
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,953
That's just what you are.

682
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:35,041
Pull yourself together, Sae-ro-yi.

683
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,127
Know your place.

684
00:47:41,464 --> 00:47:45,260
Soo-ah is in trouble
at work because of you.

685
00:47:46,136 --> 00:47:48,346
Can't you be more considerate?

686
00:47:48,638 --> 00:47:50,390
And don't overrate yourself.

687
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:10,827
<i>Hello?</i>

688
00:48:11,536 --> 00:48:13,914
What took you so long to answer my call?

689
00:48:14,581 --> 00:48:15,624
I'm busy.

690
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:16,917
Why did you call?

691
00:48:17,584 --> 00:48:18,543
Are you in Itaewon?

692
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:20,211
<i>Yes. Why?</i>

693
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:21,588
To see that jerk?

694
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:27,510
-Hey.
-<i>I met him earlier.</i>

695
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:29,262
<i>Park Sae-ro-yi.</i>

696
00:48:29,846 --> 00:48:31,306
You know <i>The Best Pub</i>, right?

697
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:33,767
The TV show I'm working on.

698
00:48:35,018 --> 00:48:36,937
<i>He came to the broadcasting company too.</i>

699
00:48:37,437 --> 00:48:39,648
I want to teach him a lesson.

700
00:48:42,442 --> 00:48:45,362
-Are you...
-Don't like that jerk.

701
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:50,033
<i>This isn't just about me.
What if my father finds out...</i>

702
00:48:53,745 --> 00:48:55,205
That crazy punk.

703
00:49:05,548 --> 00:49:06,508
Hang on.

704
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:09,094
We've been working on it
according to your schedule.

705
00:49:09,177 --> 00:49:11,304
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

706
00:49:11,888 --> 00:49:12,806
No, I...

707
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:13,974
I get that.

708
00:49:14,057 --> 00:49:16,309
You have to at lease tell me the reason.

709
00:49:16,393 --> 00:49:18,561
I need to be convinced.

710
00:49:19,145 --> 00:49:20,313
Director?

711
00:49:20,397 --> 00:49:21,398
Hello?

712
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:26,194
You startled me.

713
00:49:26,778 --> 00:49:28,697
Why? What did they say?

714
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:42,002
The show.

715
00:49:43,837 --> 00:49:45,005
It's canceled.

716
00:49:49,092 --> 00:49:49,926
You're here.

717
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:53,763
Boss.

718
00:49:55,515 --> 00:49:57,976
Did something happen
at the broadcasting company?

719

DANBAM

720
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,829
Soo-ah is in trouble
at work because of you.

721
00:50:18,747 --> 00:50:20,874
Can't you be more considerate?

722
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,211
<i>The person</i>

723
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:27,255
who reported your pub to the police.

724
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:31,009
It's me.

725
00:50:31,092 --> 00:50:33,553
I've lived as an employee of Jangga.

726
00:50:34,471 --> 00:50:35,972
And I will continue to do so.

727
00:50:50,195 --> 00:50:51,738
What's the matter?

728
00:50:55,825 --> 00:50:56,910
The show.

729
00:50:58,244 --> 00:51:01,623
You've worked hard for the project.
I'm sorry.

730
00:51:02,832 --> 00:51:04,292
It's no big deal.

731
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:06,419
There are a lot of other channels.

732
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:11,257
What?

733
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:13,426
Did the director pick a fight?

734
00:51:14,177 --> 00:51:17,013
What happened?
What's that look on your face?

735
00:51:26,439 --> 00:51:27,690
Shall we go have a walk?

736
00:51:30,735 --> 00:51:31,736
Sure.

737
00:51:37,158 --> 00:51:39,577
Aren't you going to tell me what happened?

738
00:51:40,787 --> 00:51:42,205
Nothing happened.

739
00:51:43,873 --> 00:51:46,876
I think you can tell me now.

740
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:49,838
Sae-ro-yi.

741
00:51:57,345 --> 00:51:58,221
Hey.

742
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:00,140
Are you on a date?

743
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:04,060
No way.

744
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:06,604
I was checking how things
are in other pubs.

745
00:52:12,402 --> 00:52:13,945
You work at the office during the day

746
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:16,698
and come all the way to Itaewon
for the pub at night.

747
00:52:17,157 --> 00:52:18,366
You must be tired.

748
00:52:19,951 --> 00:52:21,661
I get paid more instead.

749
00:52:24,164 --> 00:52:26,624
-Did you get off work?
-Yes.

750
00:52:30,795 --> 00:52:31,880
Well...

751
00:52:32,046 --> 00:52:33,423
About the TV show--

752
00:52:33,506 --> 00:52:34,465
It's okay.

753
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:36,676
I can do it some other time.

754
00:52:37,135 --> 00:52:39,179
It's not like there's only one TV show.

755
00:52:40,263 --> 00:52:41,097
What?

756
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:45,727
You might miss the last bus.
Go home safely.

757
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,563
Shall we go back now?

758
00:53:22,263 --> 00:53:24,557
I guess something huge happened.

759
00:53:25,683 --> 00:53:26,684
What do you mean?

760
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:29,687
This isn't really like you.

761
00:53:30,563 --> 00:53:31,648
I know.

762
00:53:33,191 --> 00:53:35,151
I know I'm being pathetic.

763
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:38,321
So why did you do that?

764
00:53:39,822 --> 00:53:41,324
I feel like I'm up against a wall.

765
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,249
Do you like her a lot?

766
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:53,878
What?

767
00:53:55,338 --> 00:53:57,590
You know she reported our pub.

768
00:53:57,924 --> 00:54:00,134
But you don't seem to have changed.

769
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:06,432
Are you talking about betrayal
or something again?

770
00:54:11,604 --> 00:54:13,606
It's cold. Let's go.

771
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:16,442
My mom said

772
00:54:19,862 --> 00:54:22,699
studying hard doesn't
really guarantee success these days.

773
00:54:23,283 --> 00:54:25,493
So she let me learn a lot of things

774
00:54:25,576 --> 00:54:27,829
like sports, music, go, and everything.

775
00:54:28,955 --> 00:54:32,083
I liked to play go,
so I learned it for quite long.

776
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:35,003
But even when I played it
with someone who's a lot better than me,

777
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:37,255
I never did it with a handicap.

778
00:54:39,048 --> 00:54:41,009
So you were quite daring
even when you were young.

779
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:42,885
But these days,

780
00:54:44,012 --> 00:54:45,805
I feel like I'm playing go
with a handicap.

781
00:54:47,223 --> 00:54:49,809
-A handicap?
-I mean the business suspension.

782
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:53,604
It's not her who reported it.

783
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:58,985
What?

784
00:54:59,569 --> 00:55:01,195
It was someone else.

785
00:55:08,786 --> 00:55:10,663
Who is it then?

786
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:15,918
Someone who holds a grudge
against me called the police.

787
00:55:24,052 --> 00:55:25,970
You go on ahead. I'll be right there.

788
00:55:38,274 --> 00:55:40,068
<i>No matter who my opponent was,</i>

789
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:43,363
<i>I eventually won.</i>

790
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,741
<i>So I'm not</i>

791
00:55:48,493 --> 00:55:49,702
<i>giving up.</i>

792
00:56:06,344 --> 00:56:07,887
<i>I know</i>

793
00:56:08,763 --> 00:56:11,557
<i>what Jangga Co. means to you.</i>

794
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:15,353
<i>You can resent me.</i>

795
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,487
<i>Soo-ah is in trouble
at work because of you.</i>

796
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,949
Can't you be more considerate?

797
00:56:49,637 --> 00:56:50,721
<i>You seriously shouldn't</i>

798
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:54,183
like me anymore.

799
00:57:06,612 --> 00:57:07,613
What?

800
00:57:08,114 --> 00:57:09,031
Is something wrong?

801
00:57:09,782 --> 00:57:11,284
What's the rush?

802
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,460
About today...

803
00:57:20,543 --> 00:57:22,170
It's not you who reported my pub.

804
00:57:25,882 --> 00:57:26,966
What do you mean?

805
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,426
Why?

806
00:57:29,135 --> 00:57:30,595
Why did you lie to me?

807
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:34,182
Sae-ro-yi.

808
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:36,726
Do you want me to hate you?

809
00:57:39,145 --> 00:57:40,396
I told you.

810
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:43,024
Chairman Jang has an eye on you.

811
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:45,359
And I work for Jangga--

812
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:54,785
Sorry.

813
00:57:56,454 --> 00:57:57,705
I'm sorry.

814
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:03,294
It's me who's being selfish.

815
00:58:04,378 --> 00:58:06,214
I've only cared about myself.

816
00:58:10,968 --> 00:58:12,178
I told you.

817
00:58:14,305 --> 00:58:15,681
You shouldn't like me.

818
00:58:17,475 --> 00:58:19,393
I'm sorry I made you struggle

819
00:58:21,103 --> 00:58:22,647
between Jangga and me.

820
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:28,319
-Let go of me.
-Just a little more.

821
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:34,408
I know it's hard.

822
00:58:35,368 --> 00:58:36,994
But hang in there for me a little more.

823
00:58:48,923 --> 00:58:49,799
I should go.

824
00:58:50,758 --> 00:58:52,969
I don't care whatever you do to me.

825
00:58:57,306 --> 00:58:58,391
I told you.

826
00:58:59,058 --> 00:59:00,518
Don't worry about me.

827
00:59:01,143 --> 00:59:03,062
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

828
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:10,069
So that you won't suffer,

829
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:11,404
I'll...

830
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:14,865
destroy Jangga Co.

831
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:34,552
I'll make you quit to ease your mind.

832
01:00:02,955 --> 01:00:04,248
You fool.

833
01:00:13,507 --> 01:00:15,551
<i>You've worked so hard for ten years,</i>

834
01:00:15,635 --> 01:00:17,928
but all you have achieved
is opening a tiny pub.

835
01:00:18,638 --> 01:00:21,182
He said you'd never be a threat to us.

01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:38,074
SAE-RO-YI

838
01:00:40,951 --> 01:00:42,244
Why are you calling me this late?

839
01:00:42,328 --> 01:00:44,914
About my money invested in the hedge fund.

840
01:00:44,997 --> 01:00:48,918
It's been in a little slump,
but I bet it will rise significantly soon.

841
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:52,838
How much is it in total
with the money invested in Jangga?

842
01:00:52,922 --> 01:00:55,883
One second. Let me see.

843
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,389
With the money invested eight years ago...

844
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:05,810
It's 1.9 billion won.

845
01:01:07,937 --> 01:01:09,563
Invest it all in Jangga.

846
01:01:23,953 --> 01:01:25,705
-Chairman.
-What's the rush?

847
01:01:25,788 --> 01:01:28,582
I found something in the stockholders'
list you talked about.

848
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,251
You need to see this.

849
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:34,839

851
01:01:42,346 --> 01:01:43,472
What?

852
01:01:43,973 --> 01:01:45,182
How much is this?

853
01:01:48,936 --> 01:01:50,229
It's 1.9 billion won.

854
01:01:52,314 --> 01:01:53,315
What's the matter?

855
01:01:53,399 --> 01:01:54,817
What's 1.9 million won?

856
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,193
He invested in our company

857
01:01:56,819 --> 01:01:59,321
eight years ago
when the stock price of Jangga plunged.

858
01:01:59,405 --> 01:02:01,323
And this morning
he invested another 600 million--

859
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:02,533
Eight years ago?

860
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:05,578
<i>The video of him spread quickly,</i>

861
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:07,371
<i>and it led to a sharp fall
in Jang's stocks</i>

862
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:09,582
<i>and a nationwide consumer boycott...</i>

863
01:02:29,852 --> 01:02:31,562
I thought I was hungry.

864
01:02:32,563 --> 01:02:34,190
It's time to eat.

865
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:37,443

867
01:02:50,831 --> 01:02:51,791
Hello. Oh, wait.

01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,668
We will open in 15 minutes.

869
01:03:26,283 --> 01:03:27,243
Dad.

870
01:03:31,747 --> 01:03:34,500
What? What are you doing here?

871
01:03:37,002 --> 01:03:39,672
Oh, you are Geun-soo's father.

872
01:03:39,755 --> 01:03:42,716
I'm Choi Seung-kwon
who works here with Geun-soo.

873
01:04:14,665 --> 01:04:15,958
<i>Eight years ago,</i>

874
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:19,503
<i>you probably got the death benefit
of your dad's death.</i>

875
01:04:21,672 --> 01:04:24,842
<i>You invested the money in Jangga
right at the moment?</i>

876
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:30,890
<i>It had to be more meaningful.</i>

877
01:04:33,142 --> 01:04:34,727
<i>I thought you were just a cat,</i>

878
01:04:35,144 --> 01:04:37,062
<i>but you think you're at least a lynx.</i>

879
01:04:38,772 --> 01:04:40,274
<i>It's too soon to tell.</i>

880
01:04:41,984 --> 01:04:44,820
<i>You're an annoying little kid.</i>

881
01:04:45,404 --> 01:04:51,327
A SWEET NIGHT

882
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:57,249
<i>I thought I was done trampling on you
as you got expelled and ended up in jail.</i>

883
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,961
<i>But I can tell
just by looking into your eyes.</i>

884
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:06,008
<i>Once he sets a goal,</i>

885
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:08,928
he makes it happen
although it may take some time.

886
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:13,223
<i>So your goal is my doom.</i>

887
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:17,269
<i>It's funny I'm feeling this way</i>

888
01:05:18,145 --> 01:05:19,605
<i>at my age.</i>

889
01:05:23,984 --> 01:05:26,528
Hello. Welcome to DanBam.

890
01:05:51,762 --> 01:05:54,306
