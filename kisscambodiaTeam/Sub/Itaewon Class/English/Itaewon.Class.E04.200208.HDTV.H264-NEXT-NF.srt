EPISODE 4

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,811
Once you're suspended,

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,480
there will be no once. It's just over.

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,107
Business suspension?

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,025
I can just open it again.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,985
It's no big deal.

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,243
That's impressive.

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,205
It does sound like you, Park Sae-ro-yi.
You haven't changed.

12
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,333
A naive rough-and-tumble amateur.

13
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,796
I understand you though.

14
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,340
You went to prison because of me,

15
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,093
you got expelled from school
because of me,

16
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,182
and you think your dad
died because of me, right?

17
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,728
My gosh.

18
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,732
You know what?

19
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,073
You're right about that.

20
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,916
He's a middle school graduate,
an ex-convict, and an orphan.

21
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,794
Poor Sae-ro-yi who ruined his life
because of me.

22
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,798
Gosh, I feel so bad for you.

23
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,142
-Jang Geun-soo.
-Gosh. You sound scary.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,603
My goodness.

25
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,899
Do you want to punch me?

26
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,442
Like you did before?

27
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,238
Go ahead and do it. You're good at it.

28
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,116
Assault.

29
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,291
Go ahead.

30
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,211
Hit me. Give me a blow.

31
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,046
Punch me. Just do it.

32
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,925
Aren't you going to hit me? Do it.

33
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,260
Go ahead. Hit me.

34
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,309
I guess you've grown up.

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,353
Good for you.

36
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,106
You want to make a living
with that tiny store.

37
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,275
You need to be patient, right?

38
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,365
Nine years.

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,204
I've been putting up
with it the whole time.

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,457
And I'll do it for another six years.

41
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,295
-What?
-I have a plan

42
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,506
for 15 years.

43
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,469
-What are you talking about?
-The statute of limitations.

44
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,935
Stubbornness and foolishness.

45
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,354
I'll show you what it's like.

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,732
So you'd better

47
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,488
brace yourself.

48
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,756
What the hell is that moron saying?

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,681
What are you looking at?

50
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,766
Damn it.

51
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,353
Jeez, I got scared for no reason.

52
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:32,486
YONGGAK HIGH SCHOOL

53
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:36,573
So that guy's business
will get suspended, right?

54
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:37,950
Because of us.

55
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:41,120
Since when was he your buddy?

56
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:42,830
And the punishment we got

57
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:45,541
is writing a letter of apology
and running a few laps.

58
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,960
I have to say, he was right.

59
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,838
We're kiddies who can't even take
responsibility for what we did.

60
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:55,634
He didn't even get angry
when he knew about the suspension.

61
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,011
How could he be like that?

62
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:00,722
He's just a fogey who's full of himself.

63
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:02,850
What?

64
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:15,195

00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,648
You really didn't know?

70
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:55,944
I left it to you,
and you took them in on purpose.

71
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:56,987
What is it then?

72
00:05:57,738 --> 00:05:58,780
It's our fault.

73
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,914
8 YEARS AGO

74
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:09,833
I'd like to properly introduce myself
to you, boss. I'm Choi Seung-kwon.

75
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,128
Hi, Seung-kwon.

76
00:06:13,212 --> 00:06:15,756
Make yourself at home.

77
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,965
Yes, boss.

78
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,594
He looks like a smart cookie.
It'll be good to have him around, boss.

79
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,555
All the youngsters these days
look like that.

80
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:26,099
Hey, Sae-ro-yi.

81
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:28,852
He's a year younger than you.
Take good care of him.

82
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:31,563
What's there to take care of?

83
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:34,691
That rude punk.

84
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,948
<i>That was the first day I met him.</i>

85
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,117
So this is your first time in jail?

86
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,786
Yes, boss.

87
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:48,372
It's not much different
from the outside world.

88
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:51,542
-If you have any questions, just ask me.
-Thank you, boss.

89
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:55,087
Well...

90
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:58,632
-Who is he?
-Who?

91
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:03,345
Oh, Sae-ro-yi? He's a year older than you.

92
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:05,973
I hope you guys can get along,
like brothers.

93
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:08,559
But he was kind of rude to you.

94
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:10,686
Which gang does he belong to?

95
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:14,982
He comes across as rude and cocky,
but he's not one of us.

96
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,943
Don't get on his nerves
and get into a fight with him.

97
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:21,405
-Yes, boss.
-He's half mad.

98
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:29,162
What are you doing?

99
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:31,540
Reading.

100
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:33,000
What?

101
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,876
Why are you talking so casually to me?

102
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:36,878
I am reading a book.

103
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:40,549
-What kind of book is it?
-Got something to say to me?

104
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:42,509
No.

105
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:45,637
You read all the time,
so I was just curious.

106
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:47,889
There are many things
that I want to learn.

107
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,767
What for?

108
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:54,062
For people like us who come from nothing,

109
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:55,939
studying is of no use.

110
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,194
I may come from nothing, but there are

111
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:03,822
many things that I want to do.

112
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,199
But no one

113
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:09,286
will hire an ex-convict.

114
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:14,791
You don't think

115
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:18,211
you have a chance because
you're a poor, undereducated ex-con?

116
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:21,757
You can't do anything
if you believe that is the case.

117
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,759
Why not decide after trying?

118
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:29,014
Your words sting.

119
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,475
Are you talking about me?

120
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,227
Are you lecturing me right now?

121
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:35,437
Of course not.

122
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:39,107
I'm just saying you shouldn't force me
to understand your logic.

123
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:41,610
You little shit.

124
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,197
Jeez, I really don't like your attitude.

125
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,782
Why are you such a stuck-up?

126
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,493
You're also an ex-con
who has failed in life.

127
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:50,452
So?

128
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,120
Is your life over?

129
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,500
-What?
-You think your life is worth nothing.

130
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:58,585
Moron.

131
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,631
Okay, go on.

132
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:04,675
What will you do when you get out?

133
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,761
Work at construction sites?
Work on a fishing boat?

134
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:10,764
Inmate 2294!

135
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,433
-Cut it out!
-Who do you think you are?

136
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,103
Okay, I'm done.

137
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:25,946
Study? Do manual labor?
Work on a fishing boat?

138
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,864
I'll begin with all of that.

139
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:29,950
I'll do anything I need.

140
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,495
You have no right to determine my value.

141
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,831
My life has just begun!

142
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,084
And I'll do everything I want to do.

143
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:58,145
<i>Time passes by.</i>

144
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:07,946
-My gosh.
-Damn it!

145
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:10,657
<i>Every day is the same.</i>

146
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,659
Hey!

147
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:18,331
Come here!

148
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:24,337
<i>And I was sick of it.</i>

149
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:31,678
<i>And then...</i>

150
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:33,847
DANBAM

151
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,182
<i>...seven years passed by.</i>

152
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:51,072
Boss, what are we doing at Itaewon?

153
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:54,701
A guy I know opened up a pub here.

154
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:56,995
It's only right that I bring my boys
for a few drinks.

155
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,123
Oh, right. Seung-kwon, you know him too.

156
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:03,168
-Pardon?
-Hee-hoon, over here.

157
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:07,130
My goodness, look at you.

158
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:09,841
-It's been so long.
-Have you been well?

159
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:10,842
Yes, I have.

160
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:13,595
I can't believe
you actually opened up a pub.

161
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:16,848
My gosh, I'm sure this cost you
a lot of money.

162
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,310
<i>Everyone</i>

163
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:23,104
<i>is given the same amount of time.</i>

164
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,316
You know Seung-kwon, right?
You should say hello.

165
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:30,111
Have you been well?

166
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:35,826
<i>But I realized that the depth of the time</i>

167
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,204
<i>he and I had spent</i>

168
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:43,166
<i>are completely differently.</i>

169
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:51,842
Why do you come here to drink every day?

170
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:55,637
Why? Am I making you feel uncomfortable?

171
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,974
Are you kidding?
You're helping me increase my sales.

172
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,726
Why are you so busy?
There are no customers.

173
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:03,645
Join me for a drink.

174
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:11,486
You always come alone these days.

175
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:13,530
Is something bothering you?

176
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,452
No, not really.

177
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:22,581
I just enjoy watching you work here.

178
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:24,708
What?

179
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,459
I'm your fan.

180
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,213
What are you talking about?

181
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:35,218
I'm just impressed.
You're doing what you want.

182
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:39,764
I want to live a proper life like you.

183
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,563
What's a proper life?

184
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:47,939
Not doing bad things

185
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,358
and working diligently.

186
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:54,404
I remember the day we first met.

187
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:58,491
-What?
-You think your life is worth nothing.

188
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:00,577
Moron.

189
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:03,288
Are you still a moron?

190
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:18,595
I'm such a fucking moron.

191
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:30,690
What's wrong with him?

192
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,750
PARK SAE-RO-YI

193
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,418
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

194
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:56,257
DANBAM

195
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:57,425
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

196
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:01,346
I guess he just ignored what I said.

197
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:04,516
Oh, no.

198
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:07,102
He got expelled before graduation.

199
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,229
So we aren't technically alumni.

200
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:13,024
He was in high school ten years ago.

201
00:14:16,653 --> 00:14:18,321
Jang Geun-won.

202
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:24,077
JANG GEUN-WON

203
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:29,916
<i>ELDEST SON OF JANGGA CO. GETS ASSAULTED</i>

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,544
POLICE ARRESTS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER

205
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:38,258
You think your dad
died because of me, right?

206
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,595
"Attempted murder."

207
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,431
"Previous conviction."

208
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:51,354
JANGGA CO.

209
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:55,734
Ms. Kang seems to be
meeting the stockholders these days.

210
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:59,279
Her father and I were friends
for 40 years.

211
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:01,906
She's like a daughter to me.

212
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,242
That's why you should be more careful.

213
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:05,869
Don't you remember who built Jangga Co.?

214
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:07,495
It was you and Mr. Kang.

215
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,583
The company could've been hers.
I'm sure she gets tempted at times.

216
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,626
That's enough.

217
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,713
I already have a plan of my own.

218
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:19,591
Okay.

219
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:21,634
By the way,

220
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,763
remember how Geun-soo recently got caught

221
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:26,848
drinking at a pub?

222
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:28,308
Do you know

223
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:30,226
who the owner of that pub is?

224
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,481
It turns out,

225
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:36,191
it was Sae-ro-yi's pub.

226
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:46,034
His business got suspended for two months.

227
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:50,121
He probably saved up
really hard for seven years

228
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:53,875
so he could finally open up that tiny pub.

229
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,045
He won't have the money to maintain it.

230
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:59,297
He's done.

231
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,887
Atari.

232
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:10,350
You're finally pretty good.

233
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,227
No, I still have a long way to go.

234
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,978
Leave it. I want to take a look.

235
00:16:15,563 --> 00:16:16,564
Okay.

236
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:19,484
I have to say, I feel bad.

237
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:24,614
He's suffering because of my family again.

238
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,326
Business isn't for everyone.

239
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,953
I'll be off now.

240
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,798
He should've drawn a bigger picture.

241
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:43,258
Pardon?

242
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:46,928
The borderlines are too weak
because he focused too much on the center.

243
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:49,055
I wouldn't call this a good game.

244
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,811
Mr. Kim.

245
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:56,563
Yes, sir.

246
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,648
How is Geun-soo doing these days?

247
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:01,151
Welcome.

248
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:09,492
It's not like I want to fire him either.

249
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,703
But the minimum wage
is going to increase next year.

250
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:14,956
So you want me to fire him
even though he works so hard?

251
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,416
What about his severance pay?

252
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:18,835
What severance pay?

253
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:20,837
No one hires
high school students these days.

254
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,631
We were nice enough
to give him a job in the first place.

255
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:27,218
We're not paying for his insurance,
and we didn't even write up a contract.

256
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,554
You're unbelievable.

257
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:33,099
You should be mean to him from now on
so that he'll quit on his own.

258
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:37,312
What a joke.

259
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:40,899
I can't wait to see your frowning face

260
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,026
with your business closed down.

261
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:47,780
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

262
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:03,755
The business suspension starts tomorrow.

263
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:05,089
How exciting.

264
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:08,259
<i>I'm not like other men
I will call you first</i>

265
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:10,470
You know it's because of you, right?

266
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:12,555
Yes, I know.

267
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:16,434
<i>I'll go see you long as you want me there</i>

268
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:19,896
<i>I'll run to you and fly to you</i>

269
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:23,233
<i>I'll embrace you
and give you everything I have</i>

270
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,738
-Don't ever do that again.
-<i>Bounce with me</i>

271
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:30,740
-Okay.
-<i>Bounce</i>

272
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:33,534
<i>Call me when you're lonely</i>

273
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:34,994
<i>What's stopping you?</i>

274
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:39,457
<i>You know I want you</i>

275
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,876
-Just cancel the song.
-<i>I want you</i>

276
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,212
-I really can't stand this.
-<i>I'll run to you</i>

277
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:50,510
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:55,139
So tell me.

279
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,600
How long are you going to be like this?

280
00:18:57,892 --> 00:18:59,686
It's in the past. It can't be undone.

281
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:01,604
How should we handle this?

282
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:03,940
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:06,192
I'll fire you if you apologize
one more time.

284
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:11,656
That's great. Hurry up and apologize.

285
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:16,411
Here.

286
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:22,250
A two-month suspension.

287
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:25,545
Let's think of it as a chance
to improve what we lack.

288
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,422
-Okay, Sae-ro-yi.
-Okay.

289
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:31,467
Now, let's not stop the fun.
Where should we go next?

290
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:32,719
-Another karaoke room?
-No.

291
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,640
Do me a favor. Please don't sing.

292
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:44,105
Do you want to get fired?

293
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:45,940
JANGGA CO.

294
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:48,151
<i>I was so shocked at the recent meeting.</i>

295
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,946
-Because the chairman slapped Geun-won?
-Yes.

296
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,867
He's never treated his son that way
regardless of how immature he was.

297
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:58,453
I was really startled as well.

298
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:00,955
It's probably because
Geun-won caused trouble recently.

299
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,333
Our stock price plummeted because of that.

300
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,667
Don't even get me started.

301
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:07,879
I still get angry
every time I think of that.

302
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,422
Geun-won has been quiet for a while.

303
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,634
But he recently started going around
telling people that he's the heir again.

304
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,803
So he just helped him get to his senses.

305
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,140
This proves that raising kids
is the hardest thing in life.

306
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:20,558
I wouldn't know.

307
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,354
But I'm worried.

308
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:28,191
The chairman is old now.
He's not clear-headed as he used to be.

309
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:31,611
Plus, his one and only child is a mess.

310
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:32,737
He's right.

311
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,031
The executives are very concerned.

312
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,575
They think we should start preparing soon.

313
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:40,828
-Prepare?
-For the succession.

314
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:43,581
You're the best person for the job.

315
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:47,126
Yes, of course.
He can't leave the company to that fool.

316
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:50,004
Then we'll go bankrupt.

317
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:54,634
There's no need to feel pressured.
We just want you to know

318
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:59,347
how we feel about you.

319
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,600
Do you think the chairman
will let that happen?

320
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:04,560
Aren't you scared?

321
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:08,439
Why would we be scared?

322
00:21:08,523 --> 00:21:09,607
He's right.

323
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,320
If you agree with our plan,
we'll support you all the way.

324
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:17,782
Do you have the guts
to fight the chairman?

325
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:21,953
And that's not even the issue.

326
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:24,455
You think he's not as clear-headed?

327
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,541
Do you really think

328
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,960
the company will run fine without him?

329
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:33,256
Ms. Kang, please don't get the wrong idea.

330
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:34,966
I'll pretend like I didn't hear anything.

331
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:39,387
I'm not very satisfied
with Geun-won either.

332
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:43,141
But I'm too young to be used
as your cannon fodder.

333
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,269
My goodness.

334
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:48,563
That's not what we meant, Ms. Kang.

00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:12,373
<i>Congratulations on turning 20.
What are you up to later?</i>

358
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,875
She hasn't even read it yet.

359
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,224
The rent is 300,000 won with no deposit.

360
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:32,935
The dorm is about 4m2 big.

361
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:35,062
Why don't you say hello since we're here?

362
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:41,402
-Let's just go.
-Okay, sir.

363
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,703
<i>Three male strangers.</i>

364
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,081
<i>I'm starting to get really annoyed.</i>

365
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:58,628
<i>This fool is desperate for attention.</i>

366
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,756
<i>This jerk is just horny.</i>

367
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,841
<i>And he's just thoughtless.</i>

368
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:07,178
<i>I don't have anything against hook-ups.</i>

369
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:11,182
<i>Whether it's to fulfill your loneliness,
desire for sex, or boredom,</i>

370
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:14,226
<i>it's just something people do</i>

371
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:17,355
<i>to satisfy their own desires.</i>

372
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:20,650
<i>It wouldn't be so bad</i>

373
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,943
<i>if they fulfill each other's needs.</i>

374
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:27,323
<i>But I don't want anything from these guys.</i>

375
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,243
<i>I'm so bored.</i>

376
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,205
<i>I wonder why.</i>

377
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,382
Are you all right?

378
00:25:50,137 --> 00:25:51,681
<i>Ever since I met that guy,</i>

379
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:55,393
<i>I can't seem to find interest
in anything else.</i>

380
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,026
Hello.

381
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,832
-Hi.
-Sweetheart.

382
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,669
Your pub got suspended
for selling alcohol to minors?

383
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:23,713
Well, yes.

384
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:27,508
How unfortunate. You should be
making money during this time of year.

385
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:30,136
-You're so unlucky.
-Why are you rubbing it in?

386
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,888
What are you talking about?
I heard someone called the police.

387
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:34,682
I'm just angry at whoever did that.

388
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:38,102
It's okay. Thanks to that,
I'm able to take some time off.

389
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:39,603
You're so positive.

390
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:42,356
What would you like to drink?
It'll be on the house.

391
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,192
-Really? Then I want...
-Hey.

392
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:46,944
You need to pay.

393
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:50,322
Only guys get free drinks.

394
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:54,952
I'm jealous.

395
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:02,710
Your friends look drunk.

396
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:05,963
Yes, I know.

397
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:11,302
How about we go get some ice cream
to sober up a little?

398
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:13,387
Yes, you should go.

399
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,556
We'll make sure your friends stay safe.

400
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:17,516
<i>What a joke.</i>

401
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,564
No, it's okay. I'm going to go now.

402
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:30,029
-Yi-seo.
-Let me warn you just in case.

403
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:33,157
Her dad is a chief prosecutor.

404
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,494
Don't let your momentary desire
get you locked up in jail.

405
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:47,421
This reminds me of the past.

406
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:51,008
What?

407
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:55,012
You used to like me
back when we were in high school.

408
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:56,931
I still do.

409
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:02,228
Whatever. Are you drunk?

410
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:07,274
I'm just saying.

411
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:11,362
You always end it so vaguely.

412
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:15,241
Come to think of it,
you never really asked me out.

413
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:19,578
Are you toying with me?

414
00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:21,413
That's absurd.

415
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:26,544
It's just that we both
prioritize our jobs.

416
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:30,172
And once my business goes well,

417
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:34,844
you'll end up losing your job.

418
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:41,392
It'd be fun if I asked you out...

419
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:47,565
What's the straight face for?
I didn't mean it.

420
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:54,864
Don't lie to me.

421
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:58,200
You never say things you don't mean.

422
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,744
It's okay.

423
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:03,122
If I become jobless,

424
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,041
I wouldn't exactly
be able to help you out.

425
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:09,628
But I'd still cheer for you.

426
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,726
Yi-seo, wait. Where would you go
without public transportation?

427
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:24,935
I'm going to take a taxi.

428
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:27,146
And you know it's impossible
to get a cab in Itaewon.

429
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,940
I'll keep you company
until the buses start running again.

430
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:30,900
You should stay.

431
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:33,944
Gyeongridan Street is this way.

432
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:35,571
I can grab a cab there.

433
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:38,157
Why are you suddenly leaving?

434
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:40,117
Don't you like me?

435
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:44,413
No, I don't.

436
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:46,290
Why?

437
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:48,500
What don't you like about me?

438
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:52,838
Your face, the way you talk, your voice,

439
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:55,591
your pupils, teeth, eyelashes,

440
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:57,259
pupils...

441
00:29:57,885 --> 00:29:58,886
Did I say that already?

442
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:02,056
I don't like anything about you.

443
00:30:03,223 --> 00:30:04,266
Bye, then.

444
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:08,562
Hey, wait.

445
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:12,024
What a fucking joke.

446
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:14,026
Are you crazy?

447
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,195
Then why did you drink with us?

448
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:18,989
Do you know how much I spent on you?

449
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:23,619
You must feel like you wasted your money
since you spent your entire fortune

450
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:25,746
trying to score tonight.

451
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,043
You can keep the change.

452
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:37,424
-Hey, stop.
-Will you just...

453
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,930
Why? What's wrong?

454
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:46,642
You got on my nerves,
so it serves you right.

455
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:49,144
Who do you think is going to help you now?

456
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:55,776
Myself.

457
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,321
My gosh.

458
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,448
You messed with the wrong person.

459
00:31:01,532 --> 00:31:04,410
You think you're pretty enough
to look down on me?

460
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:06,912
Let me teach you a lesson.

461
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:19,133
What a fucking loser.

462
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:24,138
Hey.

463
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:26,098
Stop right there.

464
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:29,309
Hey, stop. Hey!

465
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:35,149
UNDER REPAIR

466
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:36,275
This is so annoying.

467
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,368
You're dead.

468
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:02,718
You little...

469
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,101
-Hey.
-Get off me.

470
00:32:11,185 --> 00:32:12,728
You little...

471
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,914
Come with me while I'm being nice.

472
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:34,583
-Let me go.
-Hey.

473
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:40,756
Hey.

474
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:45,135
-Yes?
-Well...

475
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:49,848
Don't let her bother you.
I need to talk to my girlfriend.

476
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:52,976
What? I'm not your girlfriend.

477
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:54,770
Hey.

478
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:57,648
Don't be like this.

479
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:00,651
You can go. She's just drunk.

480
00:33:12,663 --> 00:33:14,164
Your cheek is swollen.

481
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:18,627
We had a small incident.

482
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:21,421
If you're done, you can leave.

483
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:26,176
I'd love to leave,
but I can't help but feel bothered.

484
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:30,931
I'm wondering why her cheek is swollen

485
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:33,767
and why she's looking at me like that.

486
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:36,478
You see, I know her.

487
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,482
What's your problem?

488
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:43,986
Stop being nosy and just get out of here.

489
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:47,573
You tell me.

490
00:33:49,783 --> 00:33:51,702
-What?
-If I meddle in here,

491
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:53,453
does that mean I'm nosy?

492
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,832
You crazy bitch.

493
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:01,128
Hold on.

494
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:03,672
How nosy.

495
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,802
I can't do anything

496
00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:10,804
if you stay quiet.

497
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:17,227
Okay.

498
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:20,022
Help me.

499
00:34:22,524 --> 00:34:24,318
Okay, let's go.

500
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,991
Who do you think you are?
I told you to get lost.

501
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:34,870
My gosh.

502
00:34:36,663 --> 00:34:38,707
You fucking jerk.
Do you have a death wish?

503
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:47,549
Damn it.

504
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,520
-Soo-ah!
-What?

505
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:02,356
-Run!
-Wait!

506
00:35:03,357 --> 00:35:05,692
-What's going on?
-Just run!

507
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:09,298
What was that? What's going on?

508
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:12,759
What is going on?

509
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:16,638
He just saved me from some crazy jerk.

510
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:20,726
I know you're a pushover,

511
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:23,270
but were you running around
just to help her?

512
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:27,149
What?

513
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:28,483
Do you know her?

514
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,944
What?

515
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:38,201
No.

516
00:36:38,744 --> 00:36:40,245
How would I know her?

517
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:43,457
I'm just upset
that you only care about others.

518
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,792
Let's go.

519
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:50,297
What do you think?
Do you want to call the police?

520
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:52,424
I'm fine.

521
00:36:52,507 --> 00:36:53,800
Are you not hurt?

522
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:56,887
I got a good slap in the face.

523
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,430
It really hurts.

524
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:00,390
Well...

525
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:03,477
You should go see a doctor.
Take care then.

526
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:08,815
Thank you.

527
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:10,275
We should get going then.

528
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:12,152
Wait.

529
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:14,821
I'd like to repay your kindness.

530
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,990
It's okay. You must be startled.

531
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:18,325
Just go home and get some rest.

532
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:19,534
No.

533
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:22,204
I don't like to feel indebted.

534
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:25,916
Would you like some coffee?

535
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:30,879
Hey, he says it's fine.

536
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,173
You're making him feel uncomfortable.

537
00:37:35,884 --> 00:37:37,386
It's really fine.

538
00:37:38,637 --> 00:37:40,013
Just go home.

539
00:37:42,224 --> 00:37:45,811
You seemed interested
in promoting your pub before.

540
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:50,190
I'd like to give you some tips.

541
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,025
It's my thing.

542
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:15,632
Well...

543
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:17,467
So you said it's your thing.

544
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:19,177
You must have an interest in advertising.

545
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:20,429
Yes.

546
00:38:20,637 --> 00:38:23,640
I earn my pocket money with promotion
on social media and websites.

547
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:26,226
What's the relationship between you two?

548
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:28,270
-What?
-We're friends.

549
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,399
-I see.
-But

550
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:34,568
Sae-ro-yi likes me.

551
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:41,283
It's been about ten years, right?

552
00:38:42,451 --> 00:38:43,285
What?

553
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:47,497
Oh, I'll go get the coffee.

554
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:56,506
So you're famous on social media.

555
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,967
I thought you were familiar.

556
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:02,929
I saw you on the list of the social media
models for Jang's Family Co.

557
00:39:03,597 --> 00:39:04,681
Really?

558
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:06,266
Why did you not hire me?

559
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:09,728
But I don't understand
why you're hitting on a guy like him.

560
00:39:13,982 --> 00:39:14,983
Do you

561
00:39:16,776 --> 00:39:18,111
like Sae-ro-yi?

562
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:22,032
Do I like him?

563
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:25,744
I guess I am hitting on him.

564
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:28,705
But I'm not sure if I like him.

565
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,749
I'm interested though.

566
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,084
Sae-ro-yi is attractive.

567
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:35,212
But

568
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:39,132
he's not someone
whom a girl like you can deal with.

569
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,012
A girl like me?

570
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:45,931
What do you mean?

571
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,308
Well...

572
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:52,020
Those with a sheltered life
who think that the world

573
00:39:52,604 --> 00:39:53,813
revolves around them.

574
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:59,569
I guess you snatched some glimpse
of my character through my social media.

575
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:02,656
I can't deal with him?

576
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:08,203
Are you talking about the criminal record
of attempted murder?

577
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:12,999
Are you hitting on him knowing all that?

578
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,417
It makes him more attractive.

579
00:40:20,173 --> 00:40:23,260
You're young, but it's not cute
when you have no sense of shame.

580
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:28,723
His pub is suspended because of you,

581
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,226
but you don't seem sorry at all.

582
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,110
<i>I know you're a pushover,</i>

583
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:42,237
but were you running around
just to help her?

584
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,196
What?

585
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:44,948
Do you know her?

586
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,368
What are you looking at?

587
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:50,662
How did you know?

588
00:40:50,745 --> 00:40:53,498
We're friends. We know stuff.

589
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:56,126
You got caught drinking there.

590
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:59,170
He has to pay the rent
with the store closed for two months.

591
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:01,131
Do you even know how much the damage is?

592
00:41:01,214 --> 00:41:02,299
No.

593
00:41:02,924 --> 00:41:05,302
He is suspended because of me.

594
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:07,387
How do you know that?

595
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:12,058
-What?
-I thought it was strange.

596
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:15,854
He didn't tell you about me.

597
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:19,941
But why do you think
he's suspended because of me?

598
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,987
-That's...
-Well...

599
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,157
Is it you

600
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:31,911
who called the police?

601
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:38,585
What?

602
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:40,295
Why aren't you saying anything?

603
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:41,463
You should deny it.

604
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:44,257
You'd never do that to your friend.

605
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:46,134
If he's suspended,

606
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:48,553
he has to suffer a lot of damage.

607
00:41:56,603 --> 00:41:58,188
So it's true.

608
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:05,445
I must have some supernatural powers.

609
00:42:06,488 --> 00:42:08,698
-You...
-I'm curious though.

610
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:11,409
Why?

611
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:14,829
Because his pub is across from yours?

612
00:42:15,622 --> 00:42:20,001
Is that why you stabbed your friend
who's liked you for ten years in the back?

613
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:25,340
That's unbelievable.

614
00:42:27,926 --> 00:42:29,719
So what are you up to?

615
00:42:30,762 --> 00:42:32,681
You still want to
have a barrier around him.

616
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:34,808
You can't let others have him.

617
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:44,275
You know what?

618
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:48,321
There's no way you can have him.

619
00:42:50,365 --> 00:42:52,867
-Why?
-Because that's who Sae-ro-yi is.

620
00:42:53,952 --> 00:42:55,078
He won't change.

621
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:03,837
But if he finds out what you did,

622
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:06,214
he might change a little.

623
00:43:10,135 --> 00:43:11,261
Don't worry.

624
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:14,597
Like I said, I'm just a little interested.

625
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:37,787
What's wrong with the mood?

626
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:39,122
Did you two fight?

627
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:41,583
No. Why would we fight?

628
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,419
She seems amazing.

629
00:43:45,295 --> 00:43:46,755
I can't even deal with her.

630
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:55,221
Sae-ro-yi.

631
00:43:58,433 --> 00:43:59,684
The person

632
00:44:00,518 --> 00:44:02,228
who reported your pub to the police.

633
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:08,276
It's me.

634
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:17,160
Do you still like me?

635
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,209
Yes.

636
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,506
There must've been a reason.

637
00:44:30,548 --> 00:44:32,842
I don't know anything
as long as you don't tell me.

638
00:44:33,593 --> 00:44:36,596
I'm just a little

639
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:39,057
disappointed.

640
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,278
I should get going.

641
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:56,616
Are you all right? You don't seem fine.

642
00:45:01,704 --> 00:45:02,705
See you.

643
00:45:14,384 --> 00:45:15,218
Shall we go now?

644
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:18,930
You said you're interested
in promoting your pub.

645
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:22,016
As of today, I've come of age.

646
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,602
I guess it's a perfect time
to grab a drink.

647
00:45:25,812 --> 00:45:26,813
What do you think?

648
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:48,459
You said you wish me happiness
for now and always.

649
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:51,838
But this very sentence in your letter

650
00:45:52,338 --> 00:45:54,257
meant a lot to me.

651
00:45:56,092 --> 00:45:58,344
There's no way I can resent you.

652
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:02,599
You're just living your life.

653
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:05,560
And I'm always grateful.

654
00:46:26,122 --> 00:46:27,540
It's so annoying.

655
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,216
You just went through something terrible.

656
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:39,636
Shouldn't you get some rest at home?

657
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,096
I'm fine.

658
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:44,641
We met again like this.

659
00:46:49,479 --> 00:46:50,688
Aren't you upset?

660
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:55,151
-What do you mean?
-A friend whom you liked for ten years

661
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:56,819
just betrayed you.

662
00:46:56,903 --> 00:46:58,237
Betray?

663
00:47:00,657 --> 00:47:03,493
I'm not sure if I can call it a betrayal.

664
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:05,453
She didn't say much,

665
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:07,914
but I guess I know what it was about.

666
00:47:08,748 --> 00:47:11,084
It's just that she's committed

667
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:13,503
to her job and her life.

668
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:16,881
You sound so generous like Gandhi.

669
00:47:17,382 --> 00:47:19,676
"I've liked you for ten years,

670
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:22,011
so you have to like me back."

671
00:47:22,095 --> 00:47:23,930
This isn't about business.

672
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:27,016
Feelings aren't like a give-and-take deal.

673
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:29,185
Gosh.

674
00:47:29,686 --> 00:47:31,479
I don't want to talk about her.

675
00:47:45,827 --> 00:47:48,496
-What are you doing?
-What brings you here?

676
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:51,082
I need to organize the ingredients
when I have time.

677
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:52,333
What were you doing here?

678
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:54,085
I'm here to clean up.
I was a little bored.

679
00:47:54,168 --> 00:47:56,879
Do you even have time to feel bored?

680
00:47:57,714 --> 00:47:59,257
Actually, I'm glad you came.

681
00:48:01,342 --> 00:48:03,219
I'm soaked in sweat.
Let's go to the sauna.

682
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:05,888
-What?
-I'll pay.

683
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:07,140
Help me scrub my back.

684
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:09,976
Are you crazy?
Why would I scrub your back?

685
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:11,686
What's not to like about it?

686
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:13,146
I'll scrub your back too.

687
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,940
I'm not going.

688
00:48:19,402 --> 00:48:20,653
What?

689
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:26,117
What are you looking at?

690
00:48:29,454 --> 00:48:30,955
I guess you don't have confidence.

691
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:33,458
What?

692
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:35,293
Nothing.

693
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,466
It's not just about size.

694
00:48:44,177 --> 00:48:46,179
Go by yourself, you crazy idiot.

695
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:53,811
My gosh.

696
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:57,774
How did you start your pub?

697
00:48:57,857 --> 00:48:59,317
I just

698
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:01,694
worked hard and save money.

699
00:49:03,446 --> 00:49:06,824
And you've never worked at a pub before?

700
00:49:08,826 --> 00:49:09,994
How did you know?

701
00:49:10,078 --> 00:49:12,038
I could tell from the place.

702
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:15,541
Your pub has bigger issues than promotion.

703
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:17,543
Like what?

704
00:49:17,627 --> 00:49:18,628
Everything.

705
00:49:20,797 --> 00:49:23,132
You don't have the basics.

706
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:25,301
The basics?

707
00:49:25,593 --> 00:49:28,679
<i>The most important thing
is to stick to the basics.</i>

708
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:33,226
Can you be more specific?

709
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:36,687
I bet you've been doing this
only with your passion.

710
00:49:36,771 --> 00:49:38,606
The interior design is tacky,

711
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:40,733
and the employees seem dull.

712
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:43,611
The place has no character, nor basics.

713
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:47,406
How would it go well?

714
00:49:48,157 --> 00:49:49,617
How do you know all this stuff?

715
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:51,619
You just turned 20.

716
00:49:51,702 --> 00:49:54,497
I said I make pocket money with promotion
on social media and websites.

717
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,750
Eating shows and restaurant reviews
are lucrative contents.

718
00:49:57,834 --> 00:49:59,502
Once I get the hang
of the basic principles,

719
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:01,921
there's a thread of connections
between things.

720
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:08,678
You're impressive.

721
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:16,435
Drink it.

722
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:18,646
I think I should stop here.

723
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,273
I drank too much.

724
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:24,110
You are a drinker.

725
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:25,945
I'm feeling good today.

726
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:29,866
It's sweet.

727
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:36,414
That means you had

728
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,333
a very impressive day today.

729
00:50:43,462 --> 00:50:45,464
The pub's name is a problem.

730
00:50:45,548 --> 00:50:46,632
DanBam?

731
00:50:47,842 --> 00:50:49,886
-What's wrong?
-It's just lame.

732
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:51,679
It doesn't suit Itaewon.

733
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:53,890
Why did you choose that name?

734
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:03,107
My life

735
00:51:04,275 --> 00:51:05,443
is a little

736
00:51:06,944 --> 00:51:07,945
bitter.

737
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:13,159
It's just too bitter.

738
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:17,330
I can't sleep well at night.

739
00:51:18,581 --> 00:51:20,041
I feel nostalgic,

740
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,668
lonely,

741
00:51:24,086 --> 00:51:25,338
and upset.

742
00:51:34,263 --> 00:51:36,891
So my job is cut out for me.

743
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,435
There's no other reason.

744
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:41,687
It's just...

745
00:51:44,023 --> 00:51:45,650
I want

746
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:48,527
my bitter night

747
00:51:50,404 --> 00:51:51,739
and my life

748
00:51:57,495 --> 00:51:59,330
to be sweet.

749
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:04,126
<i>There it goes again.</i>

750
00:52:05,962 --> 00:52:07,129
<i>My heart</i>

751
00:52:10,383 --> 00:52:11,634
<i>feels strange.</i>

752
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,643
Am I drunk?

753
00:52:21,978 --> 00:52:23,562
I'm talking too much.

754
00:52:26,482 --> 00:52:28,234
I should stop drinking.

755
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:38,202
<i>Now, I'm</i>

756
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:41,747
<i>not drunk at all.</i>

757
00:52:45,918 --> 00:52:49,297
<i>This guy with a buzz cut
just sprawled out drunk.</i>

758
00:52:50,131 --> 00:52:51,799
<i>But he looks cute.</i>

759
00:52:54,844 --> 00:52:56,053
<i>This is awkward.</i>

760
00:52:59,015 --> 00:53:01,475
<i>He says his night is bitter,</i>

761
00:53:02,226 --> 00:53:04,395
<i>but I want it to be sweet.</i>

762
00:53:05,396 --> 00:53:07,064
<i>I want to make</i>

763
00:53:08,316 --> 00:53:10,234
<i>his life sweet.</i>

764
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:14,447
<i>The feeling I have now</i>

765
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:20,119
<i>is the most foolish thing
that a human being can do.</i>

766
00:53:21,704 --> 00:53:23,122
<i>And I can't</i>

767
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:27,084
<i>hold on to this impulse.</i>

768
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:30,963
Do you like Sae-ro-yi?

769
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:44,101
<i>I like him.</i>

770
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,579
Gosh, it's a hospital room.

771
00:54:09,335 --> 00:54:11,670
That was a dangerous dream.

772
00:54:23,182 --> 00:54:25,518
Gosh, I feel much better now.

773
00:54:27,395 --> 00:54:30,439
You've been wandering off way too much.

774
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,733
It's good.
I actually look like a 20-year-old.

775
00:54:32,817 --> 00:54:35,319
Being a model student
doesn't get me a good boyfriend.

776
00:54:35,403 --> 00:54:36,946
You said I should know how to have fun.

777
00:54:37,029 --> 00:54:37,988
So?

778
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:39,907
Are you seeing someone?

779
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:43,702
-Why do you ask?
-Don't.

780
00:54:43,786 --> 00:54:46,455
Guys whom you date at your age
are just useless.

781
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:53,087
I've always been curious.

782
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,881
Why did you marry Dad?

783
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:57,550
Because I loved him.

784
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:00,803
-That's surprising.
-I was serious.

785
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:02,430
I mean, back then.

786
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:05,891
Why did you get divorced?

787
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,477
A person's feelings can be

788
00:55:09,228 --> 00:55:10,354
very shallow.

789
00:55:10,438 --> 00:55:12,690
They change depending on the situation.

790
00:55:12,773 --> 00:55:15,109
After you were born, I got sagging skin

791
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:16,861
and more wrinkles.

792
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:22,032
Are you saying it's because of me?

793
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:23,993
I wanted to be a woman

794
00:55:24,702 --> 00:55:27,955
who's always loved
instead of a mother of a child.

795
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:31,417
So I got divorced. It's simple.

796
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,085
I guess you regret

797
00:55:34,086 --> 00:55:35,171
meeting Dad.

798
00:55:35,754 --> 00:55:37,089
Not really.

799
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:39,633
Two years of dating
and seven years of marriage.

800
00:55:39,717 --> 00:55:42,344
It was a short period of time
less than ten years.

801
00:55:42,428 --> 00:55:45,264
But I loved him and he loved me.

802
00:55:46,515 --> 00:55:48,350
It's like the completion of youth.

803
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:51,520
Without the memories,

804
00:55:51,812 --> 00:55:54,440
I don't have anything left
for my life as a woman.

805
00:55:57,776 --> 00:55:59,320
Like you did,

806
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:03,157
what if I fall in love with a mediocre man

807
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:04,700
and I--

808
00:56:04,783 --> 00:56:05,701
Don't.

809
00:56:07,786 --> 00:56:10,789
Don't ruin your life
for something trifle like love.

810
00:56:11,957 --> 00:56:13,667
You're too good for that.

811
00:56:16,795 --> 00:56:18,255
My sweet daughter.

812
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:21,842
You won't make me sad, will you?

813
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:26,931
Mom, you're so selfish.

814
00:56:39,902 --> 00:56:40,861
<i>Life</i>

815
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:42,988
<i>is a series of choices.</i>

816
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:48,452
<i>Producing a result
that matches your values.</i>

817
00:56:50,704 --> 00:56:52,540
<i>People call it a good choice</i>

818
00:56:52,623 --> 00:56:54,500
<i>or a correct answer.</i>

819
00:56:56,085 --> 00:56:57,169
<i>I'm 20.</i>

820
00:56:58,462 --> 00:57:01,006
<i>I'm still confused about values of life.</i>

821
00:57:05,594 --> 00:57:07,304
<i>If the coin comes up heads,</i>

822
00:57:08,556 --> 00:57:10,766
<i>I'll become a person Mom wants.</i>

823
00:57:12,935 --> 00:57:14,603
<i>If it comes up tails,</i>

824
00:57:16,063 --> 00:57:17,773
<i>Mom will be crying.</i>

825
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:43,882
<i>Did the coin came up heads</i>

826
00:57:44,216 --> 00:57:45,593
<i>or tails?</i>

827
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,346
<i>Flipping the coin,</i>

828
00:57:50,347 --> 00:57:52,182
<i>which one did I wish for?</i>

829
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,397
<i>I decided to call it tails.</i>

830
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:53,202
DANBAM

831
00:59:19,561 --> 00:59:21,522
<i>I realized as soon as I saw him.</i>

832
00:59:27,986 --> 00:59:30,489
Did you go home well last night?

833
00:59:31,865 --> 00:59:33,867
<i>I didn't even need to hesitate.</i>

834
00:59:36,078 --> 00:59:37,037
Yes.

835
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,751
What brings you here?

836
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:02,896
I want to be with you.

837
01:00:06,442 --> 01:00:07,985
What did you say?

838
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:10,696
<i>Like Mom said,</i>

839
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:12,781
<i>I'm just too good.</i>

840
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,077
<i>Love and success.</i>

841
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:19,788
<i>I can achieve all those things.</i>

842
01:00:23,083 --> 01:00:24,168
I mean...

843
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,504
<i>Feel sad just for a little while, Mom.</i>

844
01:00:30,174 --> 01:00:31,091
I want to

845
01:00:31,717 --> 01:00:33,260
work here.

846
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:40,017
I will

847
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:42,686
help you achieve your dream, Boss.

848
01:00:46,565 --> 01:00:48,400
<i>He's not just a mediocre man.</i>

849
01:00:49,443 --> 01:00:51,445
<i>I will turn him into someone amazing.</i>

850
01:00:54,615 --> 01:00:55,616
<i>I will.</i>

851
01:01:08,045 --> 01:01:14,301
DANBAM

852
01:01:17,012 --> 01:01:19,139
SPECIAL THANKS TO HONG SEOK-CHEON

853
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:25,250
Subtitle translation by Liya Choi

854
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:48,252
What bullshit are you talking about?

855
01:01:48,335 --> 01:01:49,336
<i>How dare you come here?</i>

856
01:01:49,419 --> 01:01:50,963
-Do you want to go clubbing?
-Club?

857
01:01:51,046 --> 01:01:52,339
Let's go!

858
01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:54,800
<i>You are just too picky.</i>

859
01:01:55,717 --> 01:01:57,135
<i>-What?
-Why?</i>

860
01:01:57,219 --> 01:01:58,136
Is he...

861
01:01:58,387 --> 01:01:59,721
<i>I'm like Zhuge Liang.</i>

862
01:01:59,805 --> 01:02:01,723
<i>I'm Merlin and Rayleigh.</i>

863
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:03,642
<i>So it's all about taste.</i>

864
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:05,185
<i>But he just can't cook.</i>

865
01:02:05,269 --> 01:02:06,478
<i>You have to make a decision.</i>

866
01:02:06,562 --> 01:02:08,355
He's one of my people.
That's what matters.

867
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:10,148
No matter who it is,
I'll make my decision.

868
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:11,817
So this is Park Sae-ro-yi's pub, right?

869
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,153
It is time for action, not words.

870
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:16,738
It's so annoying!

871
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,325
I'm not sorry for you at all.

872
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:23,036
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

873
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,998
<i>You are always shining</i>

874
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:28,041
<i>too much.</i>
