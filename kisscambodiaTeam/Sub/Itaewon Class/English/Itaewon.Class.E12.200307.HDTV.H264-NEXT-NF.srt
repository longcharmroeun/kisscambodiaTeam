ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,027
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,388
Are you crying?

5
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:45,475
How did you know I'd be here?

6
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:47,894
You're

7
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:51,189
quite predictable, you know.

8
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:54,484
Hyun-yi, I...

9
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:58,404
I want to be alone now.

10
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:04,035
I think this is my first time
seeing you cry.

11
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:06,162
You can actually cry.

12
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:09,916
I said I want to be alone.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,584
You got rejected, right?

14
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:14,962
I guess it was expected.

15
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:19,175
He probably said work keeps him too busy

16
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:21,594
or use Geun-soo or his age as an excuse.

17
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:24,263
He has many excuses.

18
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:25,807
What?

19
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:28,768
You heard?

20
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:31,395
It's just obvious.

21
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,357
Just try to understand him.
He's old-fashioned, you know.

22
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:41,447
So what will you do now?

23
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:45,409
About what?

24
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,662
About Saeroyi.

25
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:49,872
Are you going to give up?

26
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:56,712
EPISODE 12

27
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:57,922
<i>We came in second once again.</i>

28
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:00,132
I gave you two chances,

29
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:02,510
and you failed both times.

30
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:06,389
What's your excuse?

31
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:09,892
I apologize, sir.
I don't have any excuses.

32
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,315
I can't fire you over this.

33
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:20,319
But what am I going to do about my anger?

34
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,449
So it's the final round, right?

35
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:28,953
If we don't win this time,

36
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:31,831
Mr. Park Jun-gi will get fired.

37
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:32,874
I know

38
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:35,585
you talked about
becoming the heir of the company,

39
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,713
but that won't happen if he gets fired.

40
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:46,095
Then,

41
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,347
give me the authority.

42
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,059
-"Authority"?
-Yes.

43
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:56,480
I'd like full authority
over all the matters related to the show.

44
00:02:58,524 --> 00:02:59,358
What?

45
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:01,861
I have a bottom-level position
in the planning team.

46
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:04,739
What do you think I can do now?

47
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,535
So you're saying you can do

48
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,621
what Ms. Oh can't?

49
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,750
If I was in charge, I'd at least

50
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:18,961
have no regrets.

51
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,442
Okay, you are in charge.

52
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,528
Ms. Oh, give him all the support he needs.

53
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:46,781
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:49,200
You may leave.

55
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:03,839
I'm sorry for not consulting you first.

56
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:05,841
About what?

57
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,468
The show.

58
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:10,596
I didn't consult you first
and put you in an awkward position.

59
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:19,188
You're volunteering
to take responsibility,

60
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,440
so I don't mind.

61
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,444
Thank you for understanding.

62
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:28,280
But I feel bad for you.

63
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,201
-Pardon?
-That conversation.

64
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,830
It wasn't a conversation
between a father and son.

65
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:39,250
Shouldn't you be there for each other
in difficult times?

66
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,003
That's what family is for.

67
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,716
The incident with Mr. Park... And today...

68
00:04:49,552 --> 00:04:51,762
You now seem quite different
from when you were at DanBam.

69
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,450
-Enjoy.
-Here's your stir-fried pork belly.

70
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,326
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

71
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:17,413
-We'd like one soft tofu stew.
-One soft tofu stew?

72
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,379
This is the last bottle.
Why isn't the fridge stocked?

73
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:27,465
Sorry, we didn't order enough soju.

74
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:29,091
-Go next-door and borrow some.
-Okay.

75
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:31,844
-Coming!
-I got this.

76
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:37,683
<i>You want a break?</i>

77
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,185
You mean, you want to leave DanBam?

78
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,855
Because of yesterday?

79
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,565
Of course not.

80
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:47,234
I've invested so much in DanBam.

81
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:52,198
I can keep my emotions separate.

82
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:55,993
It's just that I've been working nonstop
without a day off.

83
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:57,912
I want to clear my head.

84
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,873
After <i>The Best Pub</i> is over
and we get our franchise--

85
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,083
No, that's okay.

86
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,376
You should do it when you need a break.

87
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,880
You've been working very hard.

88
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,049
Go rest up.

89
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:14,637
Yes, coming.

90
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:25,773
Don't like me.

91
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,070
I'm such a loser.

92
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:33,823
I miss him already.

93
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,158
<i>Why don't you take some time off?</i>

94
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:39,328
They say familiarity can confuse you.

95
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,792
I think you both need to take
some time apart and think things through.

96
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:52,049
I should just go back to work soon.

97
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:07,189
RESTRICTED

98
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:14,613
Hello?

99
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:16,949
<i>Dad.</i>

100
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,205
I wasn't really sure

101
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,750
if I should call you or not.

102
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,046
Even though
it's just a son calling a father.

103
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:35,634
Well...

104
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,429
Ms. Oh told me how you're doing.

105
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,893
Even when you decided to desert me,

106
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,230
I thought, "He had no choice.

107
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:52,359
<i>I'm sure there was no other way.</i>

108
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,780
His own son is locked up in this hellhole.

109
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:01,952
He must be heartbroken."

110
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:07,166
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

111
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:10,753
What is it that you want to say?

112
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,381
Why...

113
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:21,347
Why must you do this to me?

114
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:25,392
It's all

115
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,190
for Jangga Co.'s sake.

116
00:08:54,463 --> 00:08:55,464
Did you ask for me?

117
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:03,138
KOREA'S MANAGEMENT PRIZE
JANGGA PUB

118
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:05,975
I heard DanBam has managed
to secure an investment

119
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:07,893
of nearly ten billion won.

120
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:11,730
What about it?

121
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:15,526
They'll use that money
to franchise DanBam.

122
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:18,737
They got wings now,

123
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:22,866
yet you seem unconcerned.

124
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:33,502
Wings...

125
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:48,017
-How much time do we have?
-About an hour?

126
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,351
-Shall we take a break?
-Sure.

127
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,568
Why did Yi-seo have to take today off
of all days?

128
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,446
She's been working nonstop, you know.
She deserves some rest.

129
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:02,823
I'm fine with her taking some time off.

130
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,533
But did she really have to go now?

131
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:05,534
Saeroyi.

132
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,547
FOR LEASE

133
00:10:19,131 --> 00:10:21,133
"For lease"? What's going on?

134
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:31,727
-<i>The receiver cannot be reached...</i>
-He won't pick up.

135
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,400
It's okay. We don't need that jerk.
We still have other investors...

136
00:11:04,635 --> 00:11:06,887
WE ARE CANCELING OUR INVESTMENT
WE CAN'T INVEST IN YOU

137
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,598
An investment withdrawal?

138
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,518
WE CANNOT INVEST IN DANBAM

139
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:13,685
<i>Why?</i>

140
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,854
Why are they withdrawing their investment?

141
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:17,689
It's natural for them to do this.

142
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:21,693
The lead investor withdrew the investment,
so the others are doing the same.

143
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:24,279
What's that supposed to mean?

144
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:25,531
To put it simply,

145
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:29,368
the others only invested in your brand
because they saw the article

146
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:32,913
saying JM Holdings decided to invest
five billion won.

147
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:36,125
But JM Holdings announced
that they're going to withdraw...

148
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,253
-So the other investors...
-Withdrew their investment as well.

149
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:40,963
Then what are we going to do?

150
00:11:41,046 --> 00:11:44,049
We leased out an office, hired new staff,
and gathered store owners.

151
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,302
We already spent 500 million won,
but we haven't even started yet.

152
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:50,139
You could've waited
until you got the investment.

153
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:51,974
Why were you in such a rush?

154
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,894
-Well, Yi-seo--
-It was my decision.

155
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:03,777
Why did that investor
suddenly decide to withdraw?

156
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:06,905
I'm not sure, but this is very malicious.

157
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:10,325
But there is one person
that comes up on my mind...

158
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:16,165
<i>Tell him to come in.</i>

159
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,044
Mr. Do, you're here.

160
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,507
Hello, sir.

161
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,593
It's been a long time.

162
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,029
Hello, sir.
This is Jo Yi-seo, DanBam's manager.

163
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:48,530
Have you been...

164
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:50,282
Hello?

165
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:04,004
All I'm saying is,
it's safer to open locations one by one

166
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:07,424
than to open multiple franchise locations
at once.

167
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,637
<i>There's this thing
I asked Ho-jin to look into it,</i>

168
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,681
-and I want to think about it.
-Then what?

169
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:17,392
It's not like we can stop the bus
once it leaves.

170
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:22,231
Are you confident?

171
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,234
-Yes.
-Okay then.

172
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:28,820
Let's do it. Because I trust you the most.

173
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:14,783
-What are you going to do now?
-How is this possible?

174
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,535
-What is this nonsense?
-This is absurd!

175
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:19,454
-This is driving me crazy!
-How could you?

176
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:22,416
-I can't believe this!
-This is totally crazy!

177
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,334
-Where is that bitch?
-Sir, please.

178
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:25,961
-Please stop.
-She said I could trust you

179
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:27,879
because your brand came out on TV.

180
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:30,173
I trusted her
and borrowed 300 million won!

181
00:14:30,257 --> 00:14:31,883
It was my husband's severance pay!

182
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:32,968
What are you going to do?

183
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:35,053
They all withdrew their investment!
Now what?

184
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,473
You said you're confident
and asked us to trust you.

185
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:40,642
Look how we ended up after trusting her.

186
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,561
What are we going to do?

187
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:44,146
Can you take responsibility?

188
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:46,064
I'm sorry, but please calm down.

189
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:48,233
-So what if you're sorry?
-Our lives are at stake!

190
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,444
An apology won't cut it!

191
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,500
FROM CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

192
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:13,133
KNOW YOUR PLACE AND BE SATISFIED
WITH WHAT YOU HAVE

193
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:26,772
Did you

194
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:29,816
plan all this?

195
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:33,654
Yes.

196
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,031
Since when?

197
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:40,452
Since the beginning.

198
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:46,208
Who would invest five billion won
in that tiny pub?

199
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,002
They've lost people's trust,

200
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:51,922
so not many people will want
to invest in them anymore.

201
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:55,008
And the harder he tries,

202
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:58,970
the harder he'll fall and collapse.

203
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,559
You did all this just to crush Saeroyi?

204
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:14,152
JM Holdings has
an interior design company.

205
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:17,489
We recently signed a partnership,
and that's when I asked him to do this.

206
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,952
You think I did this
just to crush Saeroyi?

207
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:29,042
That would've been
a good enough reason for me to do this.

208
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:31,712
But that's not why.

209
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,465
It's hard to have control over JM Holdings

210
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,008
because they have a solid footing.

211
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:39,970
So I needed to show them

212
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:43,014
that I could be

213
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:46,685
a petty old man

214
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:48,770
at times.

215
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:55,819
You really are

216
00:16:56,903 --> 00:16:57,988
unbelievable.

217
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,617
You asked if I'm sure
DanBam is a small fish tank

218
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:07,873
and that Saeroyi is a strong person.

219
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:12,461
How do you feel seeing him from here?

220
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:22,721
It's true that I'm impressed by you.

221
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:26,558
But I don't understand.

222
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,270
If this is all it takes to bring him down,

223
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:33,857
why would you be bothered by him?

224
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,112
He must be something more.

225
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:47,078
-What are you going to do?
-This is absurd!

226
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:48,205
Enough!

227
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:51,833
My gosh.

228
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:55,754
You have no right to yell at us.

229
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:57,214
What did I do wrong?

230
00:17:57,714 --> 00:17:59,257
Are you kidding me?

231
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:02,385
-They all withdrew their investments!
-So what?

232
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:05,931
Did you all go bankrupt?

233
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:11,728
You have no right
to mistreat my employees this way!

234
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:13,730
-Boss.
-You think we're mistreating them?

235
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:15,732
Why do you think
we signed up for this franchise?

236
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:18,819
We trusted that the business will succeed
and gathered every single penny

237
00:18:18,902 --> 00:18:21,363
-so we could start our own DanBam pub--
-What did you trust?

238
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,908
The investment? JM Holdings?

239
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,868
What gained your trust?

240
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:29,788
Did you all sign a deal
only after you read an article?

241
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,331
Is that all we're worth?

242
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:32,499
No!

243
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,669
You all signed a deal after you came here.

244
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:37,379
You decided after you tasted our food!

245
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:40,340
You all signed a contract
because you liked the taste of the food

246
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,259
that beat all the other
famous restaurants!

247
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,596
What changed?

248
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:49,432
Did the taste of our food change?

249
00:18:51,685 --> 00:18:53,937
If you don't want to do it, then don't.

250
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,606
Just cancel the deal
instead of causing trouble like this!

251
00:18:57,816 --> 00:19:01,236
Then what?
The investors withdrew their investments.

252
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,822
How are you going to take care
of all these store-owners?

253
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:05,240
Can you afford to do that?

254
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:09,452
-See?
-Yes, I can.

255
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:19,379
There needs to be trust
when it comes to business.

256
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:25,176
And our company will not take
your money and trust

257
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:27,888
for granted.

258
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:30,640
Regardless of the investment withdrawal,

259
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:34,394
we will keep the promise we made
regarding the schedule and support.

260
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,360
CONGRATULATORY MEETING

261
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:07,010
KNOW YOUR PLACE AND BE SATISFIED
WITH WHAT YOU HAVE

262
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:09,346
Saeroyi!

263
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:12,891
Wait.

264
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:16,269
You don't have any money.

265
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,605
-What do you plan to do?
-What do you think?

266
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:20,273
I'll take out a mortgage loan.

267
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:23,360
But you worked so hard
to buy that building.

268
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,820
-I have no other--
-How about...

269
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,408
How about you just stop?

270
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:34,955
-What?
-You keep getting scarred

271
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:37,248
and hurt.

272
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,128
-I'm fine.
-Then what about me?

273
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:49,094
Do you know how I felt
when I had to bring that plant over here

274
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,806
for Chairman Jang?

275
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:56,810
Until when...

276
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,814
Until when do I need to be so harsh?

277
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,567
-Soo-ah--
-Remember what you said?

278
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:07,988
You let me choose

279
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:12,701
what we mean to each other.

280
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:18,832
Your revenge on Jangga Co.

281
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,043
Your resentment.

282
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,296
Forget the whole thing

283
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:29,384
and come to me.

284
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:36,266
Stop everything.

285
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,519
Let's be happy.

286
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:41,855
Please?

287
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:58,496
JO YI-SEO

288
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,792
Hello?

289
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,419
<i>Boss.</i>

290
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:07,672
I'm really sorry.

291
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:10,508
I shouldn't have pushed it.

292
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,845
I made the final decision.

293
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:17,182
-But--
-<i>I'm the president of the company.</i>

294
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:22,270
Don't be too hard on yourself.

295
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:24,814
You told me that I'm worth
betting your life on.

296
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:26,649
So I want you

297
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:29,944
to trust me.

298
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:33,531
<i>This isn't enough</i>

299
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,126
to destroy me.

300
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:52,217
This doesn't bother me at all.
What bothered me was

301
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:55,845
when my dad got fired

302
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,641
just because I stuck to my principles.

303
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:03,436
Saeroyi.

304
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:07,107
It was when my dad passed away
due to a hit-and-run

305
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,942
and the truth behind his death
got covered up.

306
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:12,237
I already collapsed once.

307
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,573
The reason I was able
to get back on my feet

308
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:19,202
was because I wanted to get revenge.
And before I achieve that,

309
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:24,874
I will never be happy.

310
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:32,590
Boss.

311
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:33,967
My goal

312
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:37,929
is to destroy Jangga Co.

313
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:41,349
And before that, I will never give up

314
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,686
or stop.

315
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:56,698
I'm going to hang up now.

316
00:23:57,699 --> 00:23:58,825
Let's talk later.

317
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:30,064
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:39,574
I'm sorry.

319
00:24:44,954 --> 00:24:47,040
HANGUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

320
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:48,833
JM HOLDINGS WITHDRAWS INVESTMENT ON DANBAM

321
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:52,253
Chestnut is in trouble.

322
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:54,756
The investment withdrawal?

323
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:56,674
Don't you need to go?

324
00:24:57,425 --> 00:24:58,635
He told me everything is fine.

325
00:24:59,302 --> 00:25:01,512
If our boss says everything is okay,

326
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:03,681
it means everything is okay.

327
00:25:11,314 --> 00:25:12,315
LIST OF INVESTORS

328
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,902
It's a list of investors
who are interested in the food business.

329
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:17,570
The list is too long.

330
00:25:18,446 --> 00:25:19,405
I'll have to meet...

331
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:27,872
I told you to rest.

332
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,960
How can I rest in this situation?

333
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:39,884
What did I say?

334
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:41,552
-I told you that--
-Yes, I know.

335
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,974
You're the president,
and you made the final choice.

336
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:48,685
But what about me?

337
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:50,895
I'm still a manger, you know.

338
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,653
I feel so ashamed of what happened.

339
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:03,783
And it wasn't easy for me
to brazenly come back here.

340
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:07,453
But if you still think of me
as your manager,

341
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:10,748
please give me one more chance.

342
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,086
She's right.

343
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:18,047
Why are you struggling
when you have a smart manager?

344
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:19,882
Here.

345
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,804
Take a look at the names I've underlined.

346
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:26,764
They'll be interested in your business.

347
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:38,026
What? Is it someone you know?

348
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:43,281
KIM SOON-RYE, EARLY 70S, YONGSAN RESIDENT

349
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:56,669
<i>She owns tons of real estate.</i>

350
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,338
<i>She's retired.</i>

351
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:00,548
<i>But she sometimes surprises people.</i>

352
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:02,508
How exactly?

353
00:27:02,592 --> 00:27:06,012
She sometimes invests a lot of money
on start-up companies.

354
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:08,723
I see.

355
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:11,934
-I wonder why.
-Well...

356
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,645
Maybe it's a hobby of hers.

357
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,400
<i>Thank you for coming here.</i>

358
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:23,988
What brings you all the way here, Ms. Kim?

359
00:27:27,742 --> 00:27:29,869
You've aged a lot.

360
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,956
That's how much time has passed.

361
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:35,917
I know, right?

362
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:39,712
No one can beat time.

363
00:27:41,672 --> 00:27:45,051
I still remember the days
when you used to work hard

364
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:47,845
during the beginning years
of your business.

365
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,266
Yes, I remember.

366
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:54,060
Back then,

367
00:27:56,646 --> 00:27:57,688
I was impressed by you.

368
00:28:01,442 --> 00:28:05,446
May I ask you why you sound so upset?

369
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:12,078
There's a kid who reminds me of you
back when you were young.

370
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:14,122
His name is Park Saeroyi.

371
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:20,461
Why would you bully this kid at your age?

372
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:34,225
He made my son

373
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,603
go to jail.

374
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:40,064
I know the story.

375
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:44,152
Your son is only getting punished
for what he did.

376
00:28:44,235 --> 00:28:45,403
Ma'am.

377
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:51,325
I'm no longer the poor little kid
you used to know.

378
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:52,702
My goodness.

379
00:28:53,411 --> 00:28:55,246
You're starting to scare me.

380
00:28:57,915 --> 00:29:00,376
Why do you care about that kid anyway?

381
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:06,924
I'm indebted to him.

382
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:15,641
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
mess with him anymore.

383
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:17,560
That depends on how he behaves.

384
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:19,270
Even if it upsets me?

385
00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:20,521
There's nothing I can do.

386
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:28,613
Like you said, he's just a little kid.

387
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:31,365
Why are you so bothered by him?

388
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:33,743
I don't know.

389
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:37,497
At first,

390
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:42,293
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.

391
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,879
But now,

392
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:50,051
my goal is to get him on his knees.

393
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:54,055
It's become the last purpose of my life.

394
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:57,058
My goodness.

395
00:29:58,392 --> 00:29:59,727
You've lost your mind.

396
00:30:11,364 --> 00:30:13,741
RESIGNATION LETTER

397
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:16,202
OH SOO-AH

398
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,212
Is there something wrong?

399
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:31,551
No.

400
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:38,808
I guess it's because
of the investment withdrawal.

401
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:41,143
I was also shocked.

402
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:43,521
The more I get to know my dad,

403
00:30:44,188 --> 00:30:46,315
the more I'm amazed by what he can do.

404
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:51,362
What do you mean?

405
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,406
What?

406
00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:56,158
He planted a lead investor as a mole

407
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,828
and made all the investors
turn their backs on DanBam.

408
00:30:58,911 --> 00:30:59,954
You think that's amazing?

409
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,541
To destroy other people's lives?

410
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,467
When there's an opportunity,

411
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:18,514
Saeroyi will do the same.

412
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:23,894
-What?
-My dad and Saeroyi

413
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:26,188
are both the same.

414
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:28,816
They don't care about how others feel.

415
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,860
They only care about their goals.

416
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:34,530
To be honest,

417
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:37,491
I thought you'd be the same.

418
00:31:44,665 --> 00:31:48,794
WE ARE CLOSED FOR A WEEK
WE WILL RETURN WITH BETTER SERVICE

419
00:31:48,878 --> 00:31:51,255
<i>We can't run the pub
in this kind of situation.</i>

420
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:54,925
This week, let's focus on <i>The Best Pub</i>
and finding new investors.

421
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:57,345
Hyun-yi, focus on <i>The Best Pub</i>.

422
00:31:57,762 --> 00:31:58,929
Seung-kwon will help you.

423
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:00,014
-Okay.
-Okay.

424
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:02,642
We will try to find new investors.

425
00:32:03,351 --> 00:32:05,561
-Okay.
-Do Jung-myeong, that asshole.

426
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,106
-It's all my fault.
-What?

427
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:12,068
-What...
-Stop saying that.

428
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:13,736
I know

429
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:17,198
this may sound a little brazen.

430
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:21,577
But I know very well that the four of us

431
00:32:22,995 --> 00:32:26,999
won't give up
because of something like this.

432
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,628
Of course. Who says we'll give up?

433
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:36,509
Like always, we'll find the right answer.

434
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:37,843
Let's do our best

435
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:40,096
to overcome this.

436
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:42,264
Of course.

437
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,984
Thank you.

438
00:32:57,488 --> 00:32:58,531
For what?

439
00:32:59,865 --> 00:33:00,950
Just...

440
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:03,119
Everything.

441
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:14,672
Do you feel better now?

442
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,552
What do you mean?

443
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,724
Have you straightened out everything?

444
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:28,686
About what?

445
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:31,272
About how I like you?

446
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:38,779
I like you so much

447
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:41,949
that it's hard to even explain.

448
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:48,414
I liked you so much

449
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:51,751
that I decided to work here
instead of going to college.

450
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:56,088
You're the only reason

451
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,216
why I chose to work here.

452
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:05,389
-Yi-seo.
-I don't mind that you don't feel

453
00:34:06,223 --> 00:34:07,266
the same way.

454
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:11,854
Like you said last time,

455
00:34:12,688 --> 00:34:15,149
this isn't something
that you give and take.

456
00:34:20,738 --> 00:34:21,906
But I still like you.

457
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:29,955
So don't tell me
not to like you or to give up.

458
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:34,084
I'll just do what I want.
You have no right to tell me what to do.

459
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,799
If you want to fire me
for feeling this way,

460
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:41,926
go ahead.

461
00:34:42,843 --> 00:34:44,011
I can accept that.

462
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:55,856
-Are you going to fire me?
-No.

463
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:01,195
I can't do that.

464
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:05,908
I can't even imagine DanBam

465
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,328
without you.

466
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:14,208
-You're so selfish.
-Hey.

467
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,966
I'll be satisfied with this for now.

468
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,084
-Hey, Yi-seo.
-<i>Boss, where are you?</i>

469
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:50,004
-<i>Why aren't you at the pub?</i>
-I'm at the office.

470
00:35:50,546 --> 00:35:52,756
<i>You need to come to the pub.
Come as fast as possible.</i>

471
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,799
Right now?

472
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,563
I can't believe
you're using me as a driver.

473
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:09,648
My gosh, I would never do that.

474
00:36:13,986 --> 00:36:16,405
Hello, have you been well?

475
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:21,577
You can sit here, Ms. Kim.

476
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,746
Where is Chestnut?

477
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:26,165
He'll be right here.
Just wait a little bit.

478
00:36:26,373 --> 00:36:27,458
Ms. Kang, you can sit here.

479
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:29,502
How did you know Ms. Kim and I were close?

480
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:33,214
Ho-jin told me that she was the first one
to invest in Jangga Co.

481
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:43,933
-There he is.
-Ms. Kang.

482
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:46,101
Hey, Ms. Kim.

483
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:48,896
Say hello. She's been my mentor
ever since I was young.

484
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:52,358
Yes, I already know her.
I heard you're a real estate mogul.

485
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:56,111
Did you call them?

486
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:58,197
Boss, hurry up and sit down.

487
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:05,663
I heard all the investors
withdrew their investment.

488
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:08,624
Yes.

489
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,670
Don't even get me started.
We're in a complete mess.

490
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:14,964
Toni even took some time off,

491
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:17,091
so we're really struggling right now.

492
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:20,135
My goodness,
you must've had everything ready.

493
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:24,265
Did you find a new investor?

494
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:28,227
We're trying our best,
but it's really hard.

495
00:37:33,607 --> 00:37:35,317
My goodness, how strange.

496
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:37,444
You know that I'm rich.

497
00:37:37,695 --> 00:37:40,030
Now that I'm indebted to you,

498
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:43,284
it's worth asking me for a favor.

499
00:37:49,957 --> 00:37:52,334
My goodness, why is he being so stubborn?

500
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:02,011
I don't want to use Toni as leverage.

501
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:06,140
My gosh, he tends to be like this.

502
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:09,768
I hope you understand, Ms. Kim.
He can be very hardheaded.

503
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,647
Wildcat, he must give you
a really hard time.

504
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:16,108
My gosh, why are you calling me a wildcat?

505
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:17,860
Did my behavior upset you?

506
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:21,780
I only acted that way
because you felt like my real grandma.

507
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,826
You don't need to invest in us, ma'am.

508
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:27,494
Saeroyi.

509
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,876
You're too ahead of yourself.

510
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:37,046
I don't invest in things that are useless.

511
00:38:38,464 --> 00:38:40,716
You have no money,
and you're not even competent.

512
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,635
But you have a huge dream.

513
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:45,554
My goodness.

514
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:47,514
All the staff are struggling,

515
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,517
but the president
only cares about his pride.

516
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:53,020
The only thing that matters
is your integrity.

517
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,733
Who would invest in a fool like you?

518
00:38:57,816 --> 00:38:59,401
They'll lose their money for sure.

519
00:38:59,985 --> 00:39:01,111
Forget it.

520
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:03,030
Ms. Kim.

521
00:39:04,948 --> 00:39:05,866
Ms. Kim.

522
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:13,666
I agree with her.

523
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,167
Ms. Kang.

524
00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:17,378
Remember what you said to me once?

525
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:21,965
You told me that you'll never let anyone
mistreat you or your staff.

526
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:24,885
You think you can keep your pride
and also have freedom?

527
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:28,389
That's nonsense.

528
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,350
Do you know something?

529
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,644
Freedom is not free.

530
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:36,271
Freedom comes at a price.

531
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:00,003
JO YI-SEO
PRIVATE ACCOUNT

532
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:01,380
Since the first episode,

533
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:03,340
Hyun-yi has become quite popular.

534
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:08,887
I mean, she's a lot more attractive
than a fat middle-aged man.

535
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,265
She's pretty and cooks well.

536
00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:14,643
The show is definitely focused on her.

537
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:16,353
I don't think it's about taste.

538
00:40:17,354 --> 00:40:19,148
It looks more like a popularity vote.

539
00:40:22,776 --> 00:40:24,987
<i>I have a high card
that I don't want to use.</i>

540
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,406
A high card you don't want to use?

541
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:29,199
What do you mean?

542
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:32,619
COMPELLING WINNING STREAK
OF MA HYUN-YI FROM DANBAM

543
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:40,502
JANGGA PUB, JANG CAFE
JANGGA <i>RAMYEON</i>

544
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:01,857
Did you get off work?

545
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:05,402
Yes.

546
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:09,948
What are you doing
in front of Jangga Co.'s building?

547
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:14,661
I came to the neighborhood
for investment issues.

548
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:17,289
Oh,

549
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:19,249
I see.

550
00:41:22,252 --> 00:41:23,712
Were you avoiding me?

551
00:41:26,006 --> 00:41:27,382
Do you really not know?

552
00:41:31,678 --> 00:41:33,180
I'm sorry about the other day.

553
00:41:34,181 --> 00:41:36,058
I know you said those things for me.

554
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:41,480
Look at you.

555
00:41:42,397 --> 00:41:43,899
You really not know.

556
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:49,780
You dumped me.

557
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:52,074
Did I?

558
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:55,285
Forget it.

559
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:56,995
What about dinner?

560
00:41:58,372 --> 00:41:59,373
Did you eat?

561
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,041
What?

562
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:03,460
Well...

563
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,430
What's that face?

564
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:16,765
Is something wrong?

565
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,643
No. Nothing.

566
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:23,230
I don't remember the last time I bought
barbeque to my employees.

567
00:42:23,981 --> 00:42:25,858
I've put them through a lot.

568
00:42:26,608 --> 00:42:28,527
They met the wrong boss.

569
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,321
You can't say that in this day and age.

570
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:34,616
-What?
-It's not like they can't

571
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,243
work somewhere else.

572
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:38,036
Eat.

573
00:42:38,704 --> 00:42:39,705
Okay.

574
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:46,628
What did you mean by that?

575
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:48,422
What?

576
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:51,300
Did I dump you?

577
00:42:53,176 --> 00:42:55,345
The reason I was able
to get back on my feet

578
00:42:56,638 --> 00:42:59,349
was because I wanted to get revenge.
And before I achieve that,

579
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,602
I will never be happy.

580
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,231
Oh, that.

581
00:43:07,774 --> 00:43:09,693
You said getting revenge comes

582
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,695
before becoming happy with me.

583
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:16,366
Well...

584
00:43:18,243 --> 00:43:19,244
I understand.

585
00:43:20,495 --> 00:43:22,039
I can't stop you

586
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:24,374
because I know it all.

587
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:30,964
I'm causing everyone trouble.

588
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:34,134
You know what?

589
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:41,725
What if you're done with the revenge?

590
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:48,065
Then

591
00:43:49,232 --> 00:43:50,692
are you going to be happy?

592
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:13,924
All the staff are struggling,

593
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:16,885
but the president
only cares about his pride.

594
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:18,720
The only thing that matters
is your integrity.

595
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:28,855
Boss, you're here.

596
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:32,818
Why aren't you going home?

597
00:44:32,901 --> 00:44:35,112
We were preparing for the finals.

598
00:44:35,612 --> 00:44:37,823
I have to go to the market
with her in the morning.

599
00:44:41,201 --> 00:44:42,077
What about Yi-seo?

600
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:46,331
She's been going around
looking for investors all day.

601
00:44:50,836 --> 00:44:53,130
DANBAM

602
00:45:12,232 --> 00:45:13,942
-Hello?
-Toni.

603
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,945
I'm sorry to call you so late.

604
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:19,114
It's okay. I wasn't asleep.

605
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:20,323
Why?

606
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:21,950
Well...

607
00:45:23,702 --> 00:45:26,621
I was wondering if I could meet Ms. Kim
tomorrow.

608
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:28,665
Grandma went to Jeju Island.

609
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,127
What? Jeju Island?

610
00:45:33,086 --> 00:45:34,713
Why all of a sudden?

611
00:45:34,796 --> 00:45:36,673
<i>She has a vacation home there.</i>

612
00:45:36,757 --> 00:45:38,175
Yi-seo knows it.

613
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,801
Did she not tell you?

614
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:41,887
What?

615
00:45:57,277 --> 00:45:58,403
Hello?

616
00:45:58,487 --> 00:45:59,613
Where are you?

617
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:03,116
I'm here to meet an investor.

618
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,826
So where is it?

619
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:07,996
I'm in Jeju Island now.

620
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:14,086
To meet Toni's grandma?

621
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:18,673
I couldn't just sit back and wait.

622
00:46:18,757 --> 00:46:21,009
<i>I was going to tell you.</i>

623
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:23,553
Are you upset?

624
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:24,805
No.

625
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:29,309
I'm sorry.

626
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:32,562
I'm not upset.

627
00:46:34,397 --> 00:46:36,191
When are you going to meet her?

628
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:39,444
Ms. Kim?

629
00:46:42,447 --> 00:46:43,865
<i>Why are you looking for me?</i>

630
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:47,452
Ms. Kim.

631
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:49,287
Did you already meet her?

632
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,875
Why are you guys making a fuss
this late at night?

633
00:46:54,626 --> 00:46:56,503
Well...

634
00:46:59,047 --> 00:46:59,965
What?

635
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,348
Please invest in my business.

636
00:47:09,474 --> 00:47:11,893
I will try my best
so you won't make a loss.

637
00:47:11,977 --> 00:47:13,103
You moron.

638
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:16,731
<i>What kind of person asks
for investment over the phone?</i>

639
00:47:19,317 --> 00:47:22,571
That's why I'm here, Ms. Kim.

640
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,240
Forget about it, you fool.

641
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:27,159
Well...

642
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,661
You'll never make--

643
00:47:29,744 --> 00:47:32,497
<i>Even if I invest in your business,</i>

644
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:35,333
it won't be because of Toni.

645
00:47:36,668 --> 00:47:37,544
Pardon?

646
00:47:37,627 --> 00:47:40,422
I'm a businesswoman after all.

647
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:44,134
And I know you a little.

648
00:47:44,217 --> 00:47:46,344
<i>It wasn't just about food</i>

649
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:48,096
<i>or restaurant.</i>

650
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,517
I liked your insight
that you cared about the whole alley.

651
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:57,189
I told you I'm a businesswoman.

652
00:47:57,772 --> 00:48:00,817
<i>I don't like to waste money.</i>

653
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:02,485
We should have the same spirit.

654
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:04,613
How far do you want to go?

655
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:07,240
How far?

656
00:48:07,324 --> 00:48:09,951
I'm asking what your goal is.

657
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:19,127
The first place in the country.

658
00:48:20,587 --> 00:48:21,796
You moron.

659
00:48:22,797 --> 00:48:24,966
So we have the same spirit.

660
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:29,429
Then...

661
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:30,889
I told you.

662
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:32,641
I don't want to waste money.

663
00:48:33,225 --> 00:48:35,352
<i>"The first place in the country?"</i>

664
00:48:36,144 --> 00:48:37,896
<i>Anyone can say that.</i>

665
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:40,523

-If you want me to prove it...
-<i>The TV show.</i>

<i>Don't thank me.</i>

Okay.

00:52:30,503 --> 00:52:31,463
A condition?

724
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:35,717
You have to win first place
in <i>The Best Pub</i>.

725
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,968
I see.

726
00:52:38,261 --> 00:52:39,804
What did you say?

727
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:44,893
The future of DanBam

728
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,895
depends on you.

729
00:52:47,479 --> 00:52:50,648
Why are you telling me that
right before the show?

730
00:52:50,732 --> 00:52:52,317
You can't do this to me.

731
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,860
I told you.

732
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:55,528
You can do this.

733
00:52:56,112 --> 00:52:57,947
Good luck, Ma Hyun-yi.

734
00:52:58,031 --> 00:52:58,948
What...

735
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:00,033
Hey!

736
00:53:04,454 --> 00:53:05,330
Damn it.

737
00:53:15,715 --> 00:53:17,258
What is this?

738
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:21,763
CHEF MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM
IN <i>THE BEST PUB</i> IS A TRANSGENDER

739
00:53:24,724 --> 00:53:28,436
Hey. If the chef's a transgender,
does it mean the chef had the surgery?

740
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,772
What about the face?
Did the chef get plastic surgery too?

741
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:33,233
-I bet.
-Hey, stay quiet.

742
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:39,072
Boss.

743
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,282
You should read this.

744
00:53:43,576 --> 00:53:45,453
IS CHEF MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM
A TRANSGENDER?

745
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:48,998
That's gross.

746
00:53:49,082 --> 00:53:51,376
I had no idea. I thought the voice was--

747
00:53:51,459 --> 00:53:52,919
Hey. Stop it.

748
00:53:53,169 --> 00:53:56,297
Shut it, you damn idiots.

749
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:02,345
Stop it.

750
00:54:04,222 --> 00:54:07,642
There's an article
Hyun-yi is a transgender.

751
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:14,315
-Hyun-yi.
-Hey.

752
00:54:19,445 --> 00:54:21,781
So is this the high card you talked about?

753
00:54:28,371 --> 00:54:30,957
A PERSONNEL FROM <i>THE BEST PUB</i>
REVEALED MA'S GENDER IDENTITY

754
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:32,667
Yes.

755
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:35,712
I contacted the press yesterday.

756
00:54:37,046 --> 00:54:38,214
I told them

757
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,758
Hyun-yi is a transgender.

758
00:54:43,303 --> 00:54:45,430
If Hyun-yi's popularity is reflected
in the result,

759
00:54:47,515 --> 00:54:49,475
we should make Hyun-yi unpopular.

760
00:54:50,351 --> 00:54:51,644
What about Hyun-yi?

761
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,730
What is going to happen to Hyun-yi?

762
00:54:55,398 --> 00:54:57,358
Even if you hate Hyun-yi...

763
00:54:57,442 --> 00:54:58,484
Hate Hyun-yi?

764
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:06,951
Hyun-yi's one of

765
00:55:07,827 --> 00:55:09,078
my few dear friends.

766
00:55:09,662 --> 00:55:10,747
If that's the case...

767
00:55:16,252 --> 00:55:17,712
I did this to win.

768
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:21,716
Why do you have to--

769
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:22,842
This is

770
00:55:26,179 --> 00:55:28,014
what people from Jangga Co. do.

771
00:55:30,558 --> 00:55:33,061
Then what about you
and the people from DanBam?

772
00:55:34,604 --> 00:55:36,189
What is going to happen?

773
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:41,235
I'm done

774
00:55:44,155 --> 00:55:45,406
with this friendship stuff.

775
00:55:56,584 --> 00:55:59,879
I thought that chef seemed tough
using the knife.

776
00:56:00,046 --> 00:56:03,007
How could they deceive everyone...

777
00:56:05,885 --> 00:56:08,554
This is a ladies' room.

778
00:56:35,581 --> 00:56:36,916
There you are.

779
00:56:42,505 --> 00:56:43,798
Boss.

780
00:56:56,394 --> 00:56:57,270
Hyun-yi.

781
00:57:00,064 --> 00:57:01,190
I'm sorry.

782
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,902
I didn't mean to run away.

783
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:06,279
It's just

784
00:57:06,904 --> 00:57:08,322
my legs felt weak, so...

785
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:10,616
-Hyun-yi.
-Give me a minute.

786
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:17,373
I'll pull myself together and get ready.

787
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:21,419
I knew it would happen someday.

788
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:24,297
I have to win this

789
00:57:24,964 --> 00:57:26,758
to receive investment.

790
00:57:28,509 --> 00:57:30,052
No problem. I can do this.

791
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:35,975
It's okay.

792
00:57:41,397 --> 00:57:42,482
It's all right.

793
00:57:52,575 --> 00:57:53,826
When we

794
00:57:54,368 --> 00:57:56,913
worked at the factory together,

795
00:57:57,121 --> 00:57:58,831
do you remember what I said?

796
00:58:01,876 --> 00:58:02,794
You are

797
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:08,549
the bravest person I know.

798
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:11,511
Whatever they say,

799
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,055
you're a brave

800
00:58:17,225 --> 00:58:18,643
and pretty girl.

801
00:58:34,992 --> 00:58:36,661
Once you calm down,

802
00:58:37,245 --> 00:58:38,830
shall we go back to DanBam?

803
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:46,587
It's okay. You don't have to worry.

804
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:49,590
As you know, I'm very brave.

805
00:58:52,009 --> 00:58:54,220
I'm doing this for DanBam.

806
00:58:56,347 --> 00:58:58,015
I'm not going to run away.

807
00:59:00,726 --> 00:59:03,354
I will convince them of my cooking.
I can do this.

808
00:59:03,437 --> 00:59:05,273
It's okay to run away.

809
00:59:09,402 --> 00:59:10,361
No.

810
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:13,906
It's not that you're running away.
You didn't do anything wrong.

811
00:59:16,158 --> 00:59:19,287
It's not that important
to make you go through all this.

812
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,292
You don't have to

813
00:59:25,501 --> 00:59:27,837
convince others about who you are.

814
00:59:30,506 --> 00:59:31,591
It's okay.

815
00:59:40,892 --> 00:59:41,893
It's all right.

816
00:59:46,647 --> 00:59:47,648
It's okay.

817
00:59:57,325 --> 00:59:58,326
It's okay.

818
01:00:01,662 --> 01:00:05,291
I want my words and acts to have power

819
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:08,586
so no one can mess with me and my people.

820
01:00:10,212 --> 01:00:14,175
I don't want to be swayed
by anyone or any injustice.

821
01:00:16,135 --> 01:00:18,346
I want to live a life

822
01:00:19,722 --> 01:00:21,515
where I make my own decisions

823
01:00:23,893 --> 01:00:25,770
<i>and I don't have to pay for my principles.</i>

824
01:00:30,566 --> 01:00:31,776
<i>I'm burning</i>

825
01:00:32,902 --> 01:00:34,904
<i>with anger.</i>

826
01:00:38,616 --> 01:00:41,118
Director, is everything
okay with this show?

827
01:00:41,202 --> 01:00:42,578
Hello, Mr. Park.

828
01:00:44,246 --> 01:00:46,040
Hey, Geun-soo.

829
01:00:46,123 --> 01:00:47,625
I'm here to support you.

830
01:00:48,626 --> 01:00:50,002
Isn't it to spy on me?

831
01:00:50,419 --> 01:00:53,005
Don't worry. I can do this today.

832
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:57,301
But where are the people from DanBam?

833
01:00:57,385 --> 01:00:59,303
Things are crazy here.

834
01:00:59,387 --> 01:01:01,138
I heard the chef is a transgender.

835
01:01:01,722 --> 01:01:04,558
My gosh. Their chef just ran away
as soon as they read the article.

836
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:06,936
So is DanBam

837
01:01:07,645 --> 01:01:08,562
giving up?

838
01:01:09,146 --> 01:01:12,316
I guess so. I was going
to bring them down today.

839
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,275
How disappointing.

840
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:15,319
So

841
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:17,738
this is it.

842
01:01:18,864 --> 01:01:19,699
Not really.

843
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:25,955
We're not giving up.

844
01:01:31,544 --> 01:01:32,670
Saeroyi.

845
01:01:33,004 --> 01:01:34,255
What do we do now?

846
01:02:14,462 --> 01:02:16,047
Hello, Yi-seo.

847
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,548
<i>Hyun-yi.</i>

848
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:23,179
You sound down.

849
01:02:24,555 --> 01:02:25,931
I guess you read the article.

850
01:02:26,515 --> 01:02:27,475
I did.

851
01:02:28,726 --> 01:02:30,895
You must feel hurt.

852
01:02:33,773 --> 01:02:34,774
Well...

853
01:02:37,526 --> 01:02:38,861
I'm not feeling good.

854
01:02:41,238 --> 01:02:42,531
What did Boss say?

855
01:02:45,117 --> 01:02:46,744
He said I can run away.

856
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:50,122
<i>I don't have to</i>

857
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:54,543
convince others about who I am.

858
01:03:03,302 --> 01:03:05,596
-Hello?
-<i>So what about you?</i>

859
01:03:07,473 --> 01:03:08,307
What?

860
01:03:09,558 --> 01:03:11,018
Will you run away?

861
01:03:13,187 --> 01:03:15,022
<i>I heard Hyun-yi ran away.</i>

862
01:03:16,148 --> 01:03:17,274
What are you going to do?

863
01:03:18,692 --> 01:03:19,527
Director.

864
01:03:20,236 --> 01:03:21,112
Yes?

865
01:03:21,195 --> 01:03:23,239
What if I cook instead?

866
01:03:23,322 --> 01:03:24,532
Is it against the rules?

867
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:28,035
No.

868
01:03:28,577 --> 01:03:30,246
There are no rules like that.

869
01:03:30,329 --> 01:03:31,997
I understand your situation.

870
01:03:32,289 --> 01:03:34,708
But are you sure you can do this?

871
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:35,960
Good to know.

872
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:38,379
Are you going to be okay?

873
01:03:38,462 --> 01:03:40,256
They are the top four chefs
in the country.

874
01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:43,717
There's no way you can win.

875
01:03:45,136 --> 01:03:47,513
You told me I'm a good cook.

876
01:03:48,889 --> 01:03:51,183
-Saeroyi.
-You know what, Geun-soo?

877
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:54,770
Did you say run away?

878
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:00,860
Did Hyun-yi do something wrong?

879
01:04:07,032 --> 01:04:08,450
Just be supportive.

880
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:12,371
I will be upset
if you keep acting like that.

881
01:04:19,253 --> 01:04:21,005
Can he really do that?

882
01:04:21,088 --> 01:04:24,800
We will think about it
and get back to you.

883
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,598
Seung-kwon.

884
01:04:31,182 --> 01:04:33,142
What? What are you doing here?

885
01:04:33,225 --> 01:04:34,435
What about your grandma?

886
01:04:36,312 --> 01:04:38,689
I read the article. I was worried.

887
01:04:38,772 --> 01:04:42,276
Gosh. You should
just get yourself together.

888
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:43,903
The article about Hyun-yi.

889
01:04:43,986 --> 01:04:45,237
What should we do about it?

890
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:46,572
What can we do?

891
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:48,449
Hyun-yi's here as the chef of DanBam.

892
01:04:48,532 --> 01:04:49,867
Hyun-yi has to do this.

893
01:04:51,243 --> 01:04:53,329
I get that you two are on bad terms.

894
01:04:53,913 --> 01:04:55,623
But you can't be like that
to your colleague.

895
01:04:58,042 --> 01:05:01,795
If you were born as a boy,
you should live as a boy.

896
01:05:02,171 --> 01:05:04,298
If you're a girl,
you should live like one.

897
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:06,091
That's the providence of nature.

898
01:05:06,383 --> 01:05:07,468
It's just natural.

899
01:05:08,427 --> 01:05:09,762
How could you say that?

900
01:05:12,431 --> 01:05:13,432
Fine.

901
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,935
You.

902
01:05:17,353 --> 01:05:19,146
Do you know what Hyun-yi is like?

903
01:05:20,439 --> 01:05:21,273
What?

904
01:05:22,816 --> 01:05:24,318
Hyun-yi ignores the way of nature

905
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:27,279
and lives Hyun-yi's own way.

906
01:05:31,325 --> 01:05:32,910
Don't worry

907
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:36,622
<i>and don't underestimate Hyun-yi.</i>

908
01:05:46,465 --> 01:05:47,424
<i>Hyun-yi is</i>

909
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,512
<i>stronger than anyone.</i>

910
01:06:03,857 --> 01:06:07,611
<i>This morning, I read a book of poems.</i>

911
01:06:11,407 --> 01:06:12,908
<i>And you came to my mind.</i>

912
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,706
<i>I want to read this poem to you
at a time like this</i>

913
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,375
<i>because I'm a bitch.</i>

914
01:06:32,678 --> 01:06:34,305
<i>I'm a rock.</i>

915
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:37,725
<i>Go ahead and sear me.</i>

916
01:06:39,184 --> 01:06:41,145
<i>I won't budge an inch</i>

917
01:06:41,645 --> 01:06:43,147
<i>because I'm a rock.</i>

918
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:45,733
<i>Go ahead and beat me up.</i>

919
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,401
<i>I'm</i>

920
01:06:48,152 --> 01:06:50,070
<i>a solid rock.</i>

921
01:06:59,747 --> 01:07:01,832
<i>Go ahead and leave me in darkness.</i>

922
01:07:03,459 --> 01:07:06,086
<i>I'm a rock</i>

923
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:09,673
<i>that will shine all alone.</i>

924
01:07:12,509 --> 01:07:15,471
<i>I don't break, ash,</i>

925
01:07:17,848 --> 01:07:20,768
<i>nor decay as I go against nature's way.</i>

926
01:07:29,526 --> 01:07:31,570
I'm Chef Ma Hyun-yi of DanBam.

927
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:36,283
I'm a transgender.

928
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:38,911
-What?
-What is going on?

929
01:07:54,593 --> 01:07:55,969
<i>I survive.</i>

930
01:07:58,806 --> 01:08:00,391
And today,

931
01:08:04,395 --> 01:08:05,771
I'm going to win.

932
01:08:14,822 --> 01:08:15,823
<i>I'm...</i>

933
01:08:27,876 --> 01:08:28,877
<i>I'm...</i>

934
01:08:31,797 --> 01:08:32,881
<i>diamond.</i>
