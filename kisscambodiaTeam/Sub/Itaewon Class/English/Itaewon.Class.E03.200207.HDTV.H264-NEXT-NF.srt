PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,589
Hello, my name is Park Sae-ro-yi.

5
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:20,466
<i>You can sit there.</i>

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,425
Come on, you loser.

7
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:24,262
Don't you know that I hate white milk?

8
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,764
He's the successor of Jangga Co.
He's the chairman's son.

9
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:27,849
That's your reason?

10
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,435
Just because you're rich
doesn't mean you can be an asshole.

11
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:35,356
<i>Sir, you're here.</i>

12
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:37,859
<i>Mr. Park. I heard he's your son.</i>

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,611
My dad's employee's son
had the guts to hit me?

14
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:41,946
So you refuse to get on your knees.

15
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:45,324
I'm doing what I think is right.
And I wish to continue living like that.

16
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:48,160
<i>But you ended up
getting expelled from school.</i>

17
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:51,956
<i>I know I always told you
to stick to your beliefs.</i>

18
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:53,916
<i>But I failed to do that myself.</i>

19
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:57,253
And today, I could see
you were already living like that.

20
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:00,464
How does it taste?

21
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:02,300
It's sweet.

22
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:04,719
That means you had
a very impressive day today.

23
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:06,512
I'll be right there.

24
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:22,653
<i>That night, Dad didn't come back.</i>

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,364
<i>These are the photos of the scene.</i>

26
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:27,700
The suspect wants to reach a settlement.

27
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:29,410
Why is it here?

28
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:31,579
The license plate is also amazing.
It's 7777.

29
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:32,997
This is Jang Geun-won's car.

30
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:34,999
Sae-ro-yi.

31
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,252
<i>You jerk. Why did you kill my dad?</i>

32
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:40,046
Why?

33
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:43,424
Die!

34
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:45,134
<i>Beliefs. Ambition.</i>

35
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:48,679
<i>They’re just words used by those
who have nothing but their egos.</i>

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,058
If you gain nothing,
that's just being stubborn and foolish.

37
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:55,436
<i>Jangga Co. offered to support me
with a scholarship.</i>

38
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,230
I'm not strong like you. I'm a coward.

39
00:01:58,314 --> 00:02:00,524
-I'm sorry.
-You made a choice.

40
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:01,901
So just stick to it.

41
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,362
<i>Revenge.</i>

42
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:08,866
<i>I like this place.</i>

43
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:11,285
<i>I love it.</i>

44
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,746
<i>Itaewon?
You said you'd open your own business.</i>

45
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,581
-When will you start?
-In seven years.

46
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,376
<i>I haven't seen</i>

47
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:21,003
<i>Sae-ro-yi since that day.</i>

48
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:26,133
<i>And about when my memories
about Sae-ro-yi started to fade...</i>

49
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:29,637
Soo-ah.

50
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:33,975
<i>It's been </i>

51
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,060
<i>exactly seven years.</i>

52
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:38,896
<i>The 22-year-old guy's plan
that sounded rather absurd.</i>

53
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,731
Have you been doing well?

54
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:42,108

55
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:44,819
<i>To him, it is</i>

56
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:48,280
<i>only natural.</i>

TIPSY NIGHT, DANBAM

60
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:31,449
I'm done preparing.

62
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:35,119
Check if there is rice.

63
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,708
Both rice and soup are ready.

64
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,376
To your positions. We'll begin.

65
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:45,087
Can we please skip it today?

66
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,339
Just do it, will you?
Don't be such a slacker.

67
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:48,841
Come on.

68
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:53,179
<i>Get ready. Begin</i>

69
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,974

-Do it right.
-<i>One, two,</i>

YONGGAK HIGH SJOOL

77
00:04:27,296 --> 00:04:29,423
Are you crazy?
I told you to buy baked goods.

78
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:31,967
-Are you kidding me?
-Everything else was sold out.

79
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,512
Still, how could you pick up plain bread?

80
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:36,055
You idiot.

81
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:39,266
You want me to eat it without jam
and choke on it, don't you?

82
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,812
Walk around with a sign saying
you're an idiot if you're this stupid.

83
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:44,980
Girls, hold her.
I'll write it on your face.

84
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:47,608
-Let go!
-Let me borrow your pen.

85
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:50,736
Jeez, stay still.

86
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,987
Don't be so selfish.

87
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:54,573
Others need to know that you are an idiot.

88
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:56,075
I'll buy you something better.

89
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:57,451
Hey, be quiet.

90
00:04:57,535 --> 00:05:00,663
I heard you, so just stay still.
Otherwise, I'm going to tell my boyfriend.

91
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,208
-I told you to stay still.
-Gosh.

92
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,335
Stay still, will you?

93
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:09,130
Others need to know that you are an idiot.

94
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:11,841
-I'll buy you something better next time.
-Okay, just stay still.

<i>The borough chief's daughter

98
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:17,930
<i>Because there's no jam?</i>

99
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,807
<i>-Jam...
-There are still bullies like that?</i>

100
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,392
<i>-So scary.
-The world is a scary place.</i>

101
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:23,477
<i>-Those kids needs a lesson.
-I applaud</i>

102

<i>-That's just too much.
-your courage.</i>

103
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:26,647

-Horrible.</i>

00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:42,765
Are you

123
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:45,893
-Jo Yi-seo?
-Yes.

124
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:48,979
Did you post this?

125
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,106
Yes, that was me indeed.

126
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:54,485
Do you know who I am?

127
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,737
How dare you slander my daughter?

128
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,199
<i>Despite her angelic face...</i>

129
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,203
Geun-soo.

130
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:06,622
Did you get that?

00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,668
<i>Yi-seo is quite evil.</i>

132
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:13,295
-Yes.
-What are you doing?

133
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,798
I did not "slander" her.
What I posted is a fact.

134
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:18,842
Did she do it to you?
It's none of your business.

135
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:20,511
That's not true.

136
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:23,514
She bullies classmates for no reason
and extorts money from them.

137
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:25,224
Also, she just took my pen and used it.

138
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,686
I wasn't going to post anything else,

139
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,606
but my cheek

140
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:34,692
hurts a little.

141
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:43,450
This is why parents
must teach their kids well.

142
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:45,452
Look at this crazy rude bitch.

143
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,329
What did you say?

144
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:49,039
Say that again.

145
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:50,708
Say that again--

146
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:55,713
That video clip...

147
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:59,258
When she enters college,
I'll post it on the school's website.

148
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,553
Then when she gets a job,
I'll send it to the company as well.

149
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:05,139
I'll even send it to her in-laws
when she's getting married.

150
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:08,225
Whose fault do you think it is?

151
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,229
-And if she gets pregnant--
-You crazy bitch.

152
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:17,985
Hold on.

153
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:20,029
I don't know what's going on,
but please calm down.

154
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,072
Let go. Who the hell are you?

155
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,166
<i>And Yi-seo is</i>

156
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,046
-Counter.
-<i>a sociopath.</i>

157
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:41,842
How nosy.

158
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:58,859
Hey, wait.

159
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:03,530
What was that about?

160
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:06,075
You can't take off
after slapping someone like that.

161
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,910
What do you even know?

162
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:11,163
-What?
-You said yourself

163
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,749
-that you don't know what's going on.
-It doesn't matter.

164
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:20,255
My dad died because of that woman.

165
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:26,595
Would you be able to swallow your anger
just because she's older than you?

166
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:44,196
That was a lie.

167
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,458
What the hell?

168
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:06,635
-Damn.
-Jeez.

169
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:09,054
What? What's wrong?

170
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:11,598
He's angry because no one's coming.

171
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:13,308
Shall I go bring customers?

172
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:17,187
Hey, your face won't exactly
attract customers.

173
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:18,522
-You little...
-What?

174
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,402
No, it's not that. I just ran
into a crazy girl on my way here.

175
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,737
A crazy girl? What did she do?

176
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:26,947
Was she pretty?

177
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:30,826
Men are nuts. Is that important now?

178
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:32,453
What the hell? Aren't you a guy too?

179
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:37,082
Wait, maybe you're not.
You look like a girl.

180
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,168
Forget it. Let's drop this.

181
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:41,962
So? Was she pretty?

182
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:44,548
Hey, think about your face.

183
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,341
Gosh.

184
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:49,470
Hey, have you lost your mind?

185
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:52,473
You punk,
how could you slap her in the face?

186
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:55,142
Why can't I?

187
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,769
What? "Why can't I"?

188
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,772
Hey, do you know who she is?

189
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:05,194
Right. So because she's an adult

190
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,321
and her husband is the borough chief,

191
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:10,532
I should've just let her hit me
and sucked it up?

192
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,576
-What?
-Right.

193
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:16,663
It'll be a hassle to deal with him
asking you to do something about it.

194
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:18,874
-You little--
-Sir.

195
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:21,251
She's my student,
so I'll have a word with her.

196
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:23,086
Yi-seo, wait in the classroom.

197
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,880
-Sure thing.
-"Sure thing"?

198
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,632
What? "Sure thing"?

199
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:29,051
-Hey, stop right there. I said, stop!
-Sir.

200
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:31,094
Hey, Jo Yi-seo!

201
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:35,849
<i>We have a deficit for three months
at Jangga Pub in Itaewon.</i>

202
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:38,727
The locations near Hongik University
and Konkuk University are profitable

203
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,274
because they're known as hookup spots.
So I've come up with an idea

204
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:47,236
to help facilitate that
for our Itaewon location.

205
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:49,738
To help guys pick up girls and vice versa?

206
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,032
Yes, this is it.

207
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:55,994
If we develop our own mobile application

208
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,497
for meeting and drinking
with other singles at Jangga Pub,

209
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,624
all our locations
will become popular hookup spots.

210
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,793
I'm sure of it.

211
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:04,628
What do you think, Ms. Kang?

212
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:06,129
Well...

213
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:08,340
I don't love the idea.

214
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,092
I think it's worth trying.

215
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:13,095
Ms. Oh, what do you think?

216
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:16,932
I'm against it.

217
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:20,060
Jangga Pub is our main brand.

218
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:23,480
The two pubs near the universities
got such reputation

219
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:25,607
because of their locations.

220
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:27,568
We never intended that to happen.

221
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:30,195
Encouraging people to view our pubs
as hookup spots

222
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,823
will hurt our brand image
because Jangga Pub takes pride

223
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:34,575
in offering great-tasting foods.

224
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:37,369
Thinking that
it'll hurt our brand image...

225
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,413
That thought itself

226
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,623
is too old-fashioned.

227
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:47,921
And most importantly,

228
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:52,175
such a concept doesn't suit Itaewon.

229
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:58,056
What makes you say that?

230
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,558
I agree with her.

231
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:01,435
It'll only attract a specific clientele.

232
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:03,520
And men usually pick up girls
at clubs or lounges.

233
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:06,690
Advertising the business as a hookup spot
will make the brand look cheap.

234
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,361
But young people these days
may love the idea.

235
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:12,654
What?

236
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,907
-Are you saying I'm old?
-They're right.

237
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,118
Dad.

238
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,620
I mean, sir.

239
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:21,580
What is the average age
of our Itaewon customers?

240
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:24,041
-Sorry?
-You don't know?

241
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,793
That's...

242
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,841
The restaurants in Itaewon
are on the pricier side.

243
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:35,552
Therefore, the customers' ages
range from the mid-20s to late 30s,

244
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:39,681
basically those who can afford
such prices.

245
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:43,685
Do you think
they come all the way to Itaewon

246
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:45,646
just to meet other singles?

247
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:49,524
Taste.

248
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,276
Ambiance.

249
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:54,988
The kind of quality one would expect
based on the prices.

250
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:57,199
The basics of a restaurant.

251
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,245
It's an area where we must fight head-on.

252
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,582
A trashy idea like this won't cut it.

253
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:12,297
We can't keep the deficit.

254
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:15,717
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,345
I want you to manage the Itaewon location
for the time being.

256
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:19,846
Sure.

257
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:22,891
Dad, let me manage the Yongsan--

258
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:36,446
Three months of deficit
at that prime location?

259
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:40,617
You're an idiot.

260
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:01,388
Oh Soo-ah.

261
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:07,894
Got hard feelings against me?

262
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:09,855
Your idea wasn't going
to be approved anyway.

263
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,232
Why don't you win some points?

264
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:15,861
That's all you can think about.

265
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:17,738
Points?

266
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,573
Sure, okay.

267
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:23,827
Come to your senses, Soo-ah.
You need to choose your side wisely.

268
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:33,920
How long do you think
my dad will be in his position?

269
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:36,882
What the hell? Are you ignoring me?

270
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:39,551
His position will be mine soon,

271
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:41,720
you know?

272
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:46,475
It'd be foolish of you
to get on my wrong side.

273
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:51,062
Are you sure about that?

274
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:53,774
What?

275
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:57,235
Are you sure

276
00:15:58,612 --> 00:15:59,780
you're inheriting the company?

277
00:16:19,716 --> 00:16:22,761
BOGWANG KOSIWON
BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

278
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:34,648
<i>I'm stressed out about CSAT these days,
so I've been pigging out.</i>

279
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,483
-Bullshit.
-<i>But I haven't gained any weight.</i>

280
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:40,570
<i>Jamsu Bridge.</i>

281
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:02,801
BACK TO BASICS, JANGGA CO.

282
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:05,720
<i>Beliefs. Ambition.</i>

283
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:09,391
They’re just words used by those
who have nothing but their egos.

284
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:12,435
If you gain nothing,

285
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,230
<i>that's just being stubborn and foolish.</i>

286
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,661
<i>I'll explain everything again slowly.</i>

287
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,621
What do you need to open
to count the cash?

288
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:34,291
DANBAM

289
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:35,584
Just click on it.

290
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,337
-What?
-Jeez.

291
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:42,507
Gosh.

292
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,927
How many times do I have to go over
the same thing?

293
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,762
-Are you an idiot?
-He is.

294
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:49,431
You're early.

295
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:51,433
Yes, I had nothing to do anyway.

296
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:54,728
By the way, we got a package.
Did you order that?

297
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:55,854
Oh, it came.

298
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,064
It's huge. What is it?

299
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:00,483
-Bring me a knife.
-Okay.

300
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:09,200
The business has been so slow, you know.
We should do something.

301
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:11,661
It's for marketing.

302
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:18,418
What is this?

303
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,211
For marketing?

304
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,348
Yi-seo.

305
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,809
What? What brings you here?

306
00:18:35,143 --> 00:18:36,811
I saw your photo. It's not far.

307
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:39,940
Didn't you post it for me to see?

308
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:42,484
What the hell?
Are you stalking me or what?

309
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:47,572
It's cold. Why are you here?

310
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:50,992
Have you ever thought

311
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:54,704
that it would've been better
if you had never been born?

312
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:57,791
No.

313
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,459
Why would you think that?

314
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,711
Just because.

315
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:04,631
We all grow old and die, you know.

316
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:09,844
But we have to study and do other things
fully knowing that,

317
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,096
until the day we die.

318
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:14,891
Isn't life so tiring?

319
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:16,935
So what?

320
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:18,687
Are you here to die?

321
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:20,689
No.

322
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,485
I'm too good for that.

323
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:28,488
It's good that you're here.
Let's go for a ride.

324
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,324
I have plans though.

325
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,911
"Plans"? Who's this bitch?

326
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:38,164
Well, I have to go to Itaewon.

327
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,959
I'm going clubbing with a friend of mine.

328
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,462
Look at you.
Aren't you a high school senior?

329
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:46,881
-I'll come with you.
-No, you can't.

330
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:50,301
-I'm going with a friend you don't know.
-I see. You're going to meet up

331
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:53,596
with a friend that I don't know
to dance with girls

332
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,141
and get their phone numbers?

333
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:57,851
Cut it out.

334
00:19:57,934 --> 00:20:00,186
Hey, who hangs out together at clubs?

335
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:02,564
Once you get in, you're on your own.

336
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,900
Let's go. Don't get on my nerves.

337
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,031
Okay, fine. Do whatever you want.

338
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:14,325
Hold tight.

339
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:17,162
Let's go.

340
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:24,938
You asshole!

341
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:27,524
Jo Yi-seo!

342
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:42,664
-My gosh!
-Oh, no!

343
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:45,625
-I think she's hurt badly.
-What happened?

344
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,335
Are you all right?

345
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:49,337
What happened?

346
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:50,755
My goodness.

347
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:54,634
That was a lie.

348
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:02,100
You're...

349
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:04,144
Are you okay?

350
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:06,062
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

351
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:09,357
Hold on a moment. Yi-seo!

352
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:10,984
Are you okay?

353
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:14,404
I almost died.

354
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:21,619
-Are you all right?
-She's that girl, isn't she?

355
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:25,331
-Oh...
-You're...

356
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,045
Hey, be careful!

357
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:33,673
Hey.

358
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,593
Call an ambulance.

359
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:46,561
JANGGA CO. NAMED BEST FRANCHISE

360
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:48,521
We've known each other
for ten years already.

361
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:52,483
I remember the day when I brewed tea
for you for the first time.

362
00:22:54,152 --> 00:22:55,987
-Pardon me?
-At my place.

363
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,572
You don't remember?

364
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:03,828
I do. That was the day when we first met.
I remember, of course.

365
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:04,996
Yes, that day.

366
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:07,290
My son

367
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,668
killed Mr. Park in that hit-and-run.

368
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:19,010
Why are you so surprised?
You knew about it.

369
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,308
-That--
-Yes, that day.

370
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:28,561
You doubted my intentions
for sponsoring you,

371
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,939
thinking that I might ask you
to testify for my son.

372
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:34,943
Sir.

373
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:39,781
Ten years.

374
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:42,700
It's a long time.

375
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:54,754
Apparently Park Sae-ro-yi

376
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:58,091
opened a store in Itaewon.

377
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:04,931
Did you know?

378
00:24:08,476 --> 00:24:09,352
Yes.

379
00:24:09,435 --> 00:24:11,813
It's near Jangga Pub.
Why didn't you tell me?

380
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:16,526
It's just a small pub
that's not even profitable.

381
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:19,570
You don't need to worry about it, sir.

382
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:22,532
What would you do if you were once again

383
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,661
put in the same situation
as ten years ago?

384
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:30,665
-Pardon?
-Park Sae-ro-yi

385
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:32,875
and me.

386
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,420
Whom would you choose?

387
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:42,760
Why so serious?

388
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:44,554
I'm just wondering, so tell me.

389
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,266
I'm...

390
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:53,104
I'll always be loyal to Jangga Co.

391
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:54,564
Yes, good.

392
00:24:58,568 --> 00:25:01,362
I'm old, but I'm still good at
figuring out where and who to invest in.

393
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,032
This is why I like you.

394
00:25:05,408 --> 00:25:06,409
Thank you, sir.

395
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,038
If you're bothered by DanBam--

396
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:11,539
No, don't worry.

397
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:13,750
That punk means nothing to me.

398
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:15,543
And he's your friend after all.

399
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:18,504
Do as you please.

400
00:25:43,112 --> 00:25:45,531
SAE-RO-YI

401
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:49,369
TIPSY NIGHT, DANBAM

402
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:53,122
DANBAM

403
00:25:58,002 --> 00:26:00,630
Thankfully,
there are no injuries or brain damage.

404
00:26:01,422 --> 00:26:02,840
Then why did he faint?

405
00:26:02,924 --> 00:26:04,217
He's overworked.

406
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:13,559
Psycho.

407
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:22,944
Are you all right?

408
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,196
Am I at the hospital now?

409
00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:29,367
Did I faint?

410
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,329
Yes, the doctor said it probably happened
because you're overworked.

411
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,170
The mask.

412
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,090
Where did the mask go?

413
00:26:44,674 --> 00:26:46,467
Oh, that...

414
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:49,971
It got ripped,
and they also had to cut it open.

415
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:52,598
They had to rush you into the ambulance,
so we just threw it out.

416
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:56,602
But I bought it today.

417
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:01,107
It's expensive because it's custom-made.

418
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:06,446
I'm sorry. I'll compensate you for it.

419
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:09,198
Okay.

420
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:12,160
DANBAM

421
00:27:12,243 --> 00:27:14,412
You brought the flyers at least.

422
00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:22,670
I guess you run a pub.

423
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:26,674
I have a small pub in Itaewon,
but it's in dire need of some advertising.

424
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:30,803
Who gives out flyers wearing a mask
to advertise their business these days?

425
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:32,847
Hey, stop it.

426
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:36,392
Then what do people do?

427
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,562
I'm sorry. She's socially inept.

428
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:41,814
Please understand.

429
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:43,774
That I already know.

430
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:49,155
I'm really curious. What do people do
these days to advertise their business?

431
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,824
Online advertising is much more effective.

432
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:54,952
Through social media or blogs,
for example.

433
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:58,664
How do you do that?
Do you have to hire an agency?

434
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,583
You can just look it up online.

435
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,169
But the place needs to be decent,
to begin with.

436
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,217
I only just started, so I don't know much.
I'll take that into account.

437
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:10,635
-Thank you.
-Wait.

438
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:14,847
The doctor told us
that you need to get some rest.

439
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:17,683
I'm too busy.
You can pay for the hospital bills.

440
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:21,187
Yes, of course.
I'm really sorry about what happened.

441
00:28:22,438 --> 00:28:23,689
Are you really that sorry?

442
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:25,525
What?

443
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:27,693
Yes, of course.

444
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:30,613
If you're really sorry,

445
00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:32,865
you should visit my pub.

446
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:34,617
DANBAM PUB

447
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:53,678
He seems like

448
00:28:54,637 --> 00:28:56,681
a very honest guy.

449
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,975
Honest, my ass.

450
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,645
If I were him, I would've asked
for an extra 5,000,000 won.

451
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:08,734
Just a second.

452
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:11,737
-Hey, Seong-hyeon.
-<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

453
00:29:11,862 --> 00:29:13,948
<i>At least call and tell me
that you're going to be late.</i>

454
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,575
I'm sorry.

455
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:18,411
Something happened on my way there.

456
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:20,246
I'm nearby. I'll get going right away.

457
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,581
<i>I'm freezing. Hurry.</i>

458
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:24,041
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

459
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,876
Okay, bye.

460
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:31,674
I bet you were really startled as well.
Do you want to go clubbing next time?

461
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:33,426
No, I still want to go.

462
00:29:34,343 --> 00:29:36,012
Okay, then let's get going.

463
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:38,055
He's really angry.

464
00:29:42,268 --> 00:29:43,185
DANBAM PUB

465
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:46,230
I only just started, so I don't know much.
I'll take that into account.

466
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:47,857
Thank you.

467
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:50,693
What's wrong?

468
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:03,581
-Let's go.
-You're crazy.

469
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:10,171
10 YEARS AGO

470
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,173
You're doing great!

471
00:30:12,256 --> 00:30:14,675
-Stay calm! You can do it!
-Run!

472
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,260
-Go!
-You can do it!

473
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:18,596
Run!

474
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:21,057
There you go! You can do it!

475
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:23,392
-Run!
-Run!

476
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:26,687
-Run!
-Run!

477
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:35,655
-Run!
-Run!

478
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:37,823
-Run!
-Run!

479
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:40,034
-Run!
-Run!

480
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:42,620
-Did she just push her?
-It was her.

481
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:44,955
-My goodness.
-Oh, gosh.

482
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:48,918
-Yes!
-What's wrong with her?

483
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:50,628
What a cheater.

484
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:53,297
-That's the girl that pushed her.
-It was her.

485
00:30:54,757 --> 00:30:57,259
She seems nice on the outside.
You can't cheat like that!

486
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:58,552
That's wrong!

487
00:31:01,972 --> 00:31:05,309
<i>She's too obsessed with winning.</i>

488
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:08,437
<i>She also shows traits
of a sociopath sometimes.</i>

489
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:12,900
<i>Why don't you take her to a counselor
just in case?</i>

490
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:21,409
Did you want to win that badly?

491
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:28,082
Sweetheart, you're unbelievably

492
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:31,168
versatile.

493
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,380
You're even good at sports.
What aren't you good at?

494
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:37,717
Are you complimenting me
for having won the race?

495
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:39,760
Right.

496
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:43,347
This is so wrong, Mom.

497
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:44,974
I bet it comes from your trauma.

498
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:48,352
You're using me to make up
for your average life.

499
00:31:48,436 --> 00:31:50,271
My goodness, look at you talk.

500
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:53,482
You're so smart.

501
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:55,192
Seriously.

502
00:31:57,194 --> 00:31:59,822
I'm not going to scold you
for something so petty.

503
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:04,368
I don't want you to end up
living an average life like me.

504
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:11,375
People have their own ways
of making judgments.

505
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:15,171
So the line between good and bad
can be very vague.

506
00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:21,135
But when you're exceptional,
people know it for sure.

507
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,304
Because it shows with a number.

508
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:43,616
<i>I know what she meant.</i>

509
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:47,787
<i>And I know how much my mom loves me.</i>

510
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:51,207
<i>I understood it all.</i>

511
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,084
<i>I'm an ordinary person.</i>

512
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:57,129
<i>But I was born smart and pretty.</i>

513
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:00,591
<i>Entering a prestigious university,
getting a job at big firm,</i>

514
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:01,884
<i>and living a successful life.</i>

515
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:06,806
<i>People try hard,
but not everyone gets to achieve them.</i>

516
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:09,058
<i>But I know I will.</i>

517
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:12,603
<i>I'm hungry to succeed,
and I work hard to get what I want.</i>

518
00:33:14,063 --> 00:33:15,648
<i>I work so damn hard.</i>

519
00:33:17,858 --> 00:33:20,736
<i>I bet I'll be exhausted my entire life.</i>

520
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,625
<i>So why can't the earth</i>

521
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:41,924
<i>just explode so this can all end?</i>

522
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:00,067
Is she really a high school student?

523
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:02,319
-She's unbelievable.
-I know, right?

524
00:34:02,403 --> 00:34:04,029
She plays so hard.

525
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,365
How do you know her?

526
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:07,867
She's just a friend.

527
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,869
Really? There's nothing
going on between you guys?

528
00:34:09,952 --> 00:34:12,621
She's not interested in dating
or falling in love.

529
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,832
That's nonsense. Who doesn't like dating?

530
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:17,710
Anyway, if you're just friends,
I'll go ahead and make a move on her.

531
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,795
What?

532
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:22,631
She's actually my type. See you later.

533
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:25,092
Wait.

534
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:28,053
Well...

535
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,973
There's nothing going on between us.

536
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,975
We're not dating.

537
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:35,394
We really are just friends.

538
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:40,941
But I like her.

539
00:34:42,443 --> 00:34:43,360
Oh, really?

540
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:47,489
You should've told me earlier.

541
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:50,159
I almost made a fool of myself.
I mean, come on.

542
00:34:58,584 --> 00:35:00,294
I only just found out.

543
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:16,143
Here. Have a bite.

544
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:19,772
Are you sure you cooked it properly?

545
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:22,316
I followed the recipe on the web.

546
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,484
Then why isn't it eating it?

547
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:27,738
-Wait a second.
-What are you doing?

548
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:30,574
Here. Try a bite.

549
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:33,702
It still won't eat.
I thought it was your ugly face.

550
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:36,163
Maybe your cooking sucks.

551
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,458
What are you guys doing?

552
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,835
Hey, you're here.

553
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:45,130
This kitty comes by so often.

554
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:53,931
Where's the bear suit?
Weren't you wearing it earlier?

555
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:56,642
Something happened.

556
00:35:57,643 --> 00:35:59,228
But why are you both outside?

557
00:36:00,062 --> 00:36:01,105
Well...

558
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:03,273
-There aren't any customers.
-My gosh.

559
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:05,067
None?

560
00:36:05,985 --> 00:36:07,194
-No.
-No.

561
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:13,450
JANGGA PUB

562
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:15,619
This is the place you wanted to bring us?

563
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:18,414
Yes. It's your first time here, right?
This place is famous.

564
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,874
The braised spicy chicken
tastes amazing here.

565
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:24,336
I heard this place sucks.
Let's go somewhere else.

566
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:26,505
Really? Do you want to go somewhere else?

567
00:36:27,923 --> 00:36:29,008
Let's go inside.

568
00:36:34,013 --> 00:36:35,389
Yi-seo, that brat.

569
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:39,852
Welcome.

570
00:36:40,936 --> 00:36:42,062
-Three people?
-Yes.

571
00:36:43,063 --> 00:36:46,275
I'm sorry,
but I need to check the lady's ID.

572
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:57,828
-You look nothing like the photo.
-Really?

573
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:00,706
I think it's because I took the photo
before I got my nose filler.

574
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,417
Can you tell me your ID number?

575
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,878
-It's 890731-29...
-Just a second.

576
00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:09,715
Okay, let me take you to your seats.

577
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,763
Wait. Let me check one more thing.

578
00:37:16,972 --> 00:37:18,640
My gosh, you look very young.

579
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:20,142
I hear that often.

580
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:22,269
Are you guys all close?

581
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:24,438
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

582
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:25,856
Then what's her name?

583
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:26,899
What?

584
00:37:27,107 --> 00:37:28,442
Jo Yi-seo.

585
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:30,027
Wrong.

586
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:33,822
You're out.

587
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:35,908
KIM SO-HUI

588
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:38,535
Come back after you graduate.

589
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:45,501
You guys can come back after you graduate.

590
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:47,044
Go on.

591
00:37:49,254 --> 00:37:50,464
You fool.

592
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:52,841
This is so embarrassing.

593
00:37:53,842 --> 00:37:56,136
I'm sorry, Seong-hyeon.

594
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,430
Maybe we should eat next time.

595
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:01,934
I know a nice dumpling place.
Let's go there.

596
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,144
Instead of having dumplings,

597
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:05,813
why don't we go there?

598
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:11,318
DANBAM

599
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:16,865
We did really bad this month.

600
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:18,659
Yes.

601
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:20,869
Maybe it's because
he looks too intimidating.

602
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:24,373
Will you cut it out?
It's because your food isn't good enough.

603
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:26,542
I can't hear you.

604
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:30,045
Online advertising is much more effective.

605
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:33,215
Through social media or blogs,
for example.

606
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,134
Do you have social media accounts?

607
00:38:35,217 --> 00:38:36,969
You mean like Myhompy?

608
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:41,598
Are you kidding me? When were you born?

609
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,726
But why do you ask? I have an account.

610
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,021
I'm thinking about advertising our pub
on social media.

611
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:50,899
That might be better
than handing out flyers.

612
00:38:52,442 --> 00:38:53,569
We have customers.

613
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:54,903
Welcome to DanBam.

614
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,114
-Welcome to DanBam.
-Welcome to DanBam.

615
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:01,410
You want to eat here?

616
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:03,078
What...

617
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:09,751
Here you go.

618
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,714
Do you know them?

619
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,340
I saw them a few times.

620
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:16,884
I'll be right back.

621
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,135
Where are you going?

622
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:19,970
I want to see
how the other places are doing.

623
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,722
Make sure you check their IDs
just in case.

624
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:22,848
Okay.

625
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,022
Do you mind

626
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:32,482
if I check your IDs first?

627
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:33,483
-Sure.
-Okay.

628
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:38,280
KIM SO-HUI

629
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:43,619
I look different, don't I?

630
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:45,495
I took the photo
before I got plastic surgery.

631
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:48,582
<i>There aren't any customers.</i>

632
00:39:48,665 --> 00:39:49,958
None?

633
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,251
<i>-No.
-No.</i>

634
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:54,213
-Hello?
-Yes?

635
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:57,591
What would you like?

636
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:00,761
-One soft tofu stew and...
-Soft tofu stew.

637
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:19,947
Welcome.

638
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:41,510
<i>Marketing is important.</i>

639
00:40:41,593 --> 00:40:45,472
<i>But the most important thing
is to stick to the basics.</i>

640
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:49,017
<i>When you stick to the basics,
your business will never run at a loss.</i>

641
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:53,814
<i>There's always a reason
behind a successful</i>

642
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:55,524
<i>and a unsuccessful business.</i>

643
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:56,900
<i>And that reason</i>

644
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,153
<i>always lies in your business.</i>

645
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:04,241
Why aren't you doing anything?
Aren't you going to take photos?

646
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:05,242
Why would she?

647
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:07,744
She's a huge star on social media.

648
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:09,997
-She has over 700,000 followers.
-Really?

649
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,290
Whenever I visit a nice place,

650
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:13,667
I take photos
and upload them on social media.

651
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,918
I'm not taking any photos

652
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:17,004
because this place is lousy.

653
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:18,755
Yes, I'm not that impressed.

654
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,175
I have a social media account as well.
What's your ID?

655
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:23,427
Let's follow each other.

656
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:35,814
<i>Stick to the basics.</i>

657
00:41:35,897 --> 00:41:37,065
The basics.

658
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:41,153
<i>But the place needs to be decent,
to begin with.</i>

659
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:43,822
A decent pub.

660
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:46,074
Hey.

661
00:41:47,993 --> 00:41:48,994
What?

662
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:52,956
What are you doing here on a weekday?

663
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,208
I came to see you
and also for some other stuff.

664
00:41:56,251 --> 00:41:58,462
I'm in charge of our pub in Itaewon now.

665
00:41:58,754 --> 00:41:59,921
I came to take a look.

666
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:03,592
We'll see each other often.

667
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:04,968
Yes.

668
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,636
Aren't you excited?

669
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:09,097
Yes.

670
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:16,313
By the way, you seemed a little dazed.

671
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:17,731
Is something bothering you?

672
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,316
Oh, that?

673
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:22,277
I was thinking of what I could do
to improve my pub.

674
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,154
DanBam?

675
00:42:24,905 --> 00:42:26,990
Why?
I think your pub is nice and pleasant.

676
00:42:27,324 --> 00:42:29,076
Don't you get a lot of customers?

677
00:42:29,951 --> 00:42:31,912
We just got our first set of customers.

678
00:42:32,496 --> 00:42:35,457
Apart from the opening month,
we've always been running on a deficit.

679
00:42:38,585 --> 00:42:42,381
If you don't mind, can I take a look
at your statement of account?

680
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:45,550
You might be spending money
on things you don't need.

681
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:49,179
That's what I learned in school,
so I can take a look at it if you want.

682
00:42:49,805 --> 00:42:51,056
No, that's not what it is.

683
00:42:52,891 --> 00:42:54,267
We don't have that many employees,

684
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:56,812
and I only spend 25 percent of our sales
on personnel expenses.

685
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,855
I'm able to buy good quality ingredients

686
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:01,149
at a low price
because I know the distributor.

687
00:43:01,983 --> 00:43:03,485
The problem is the rent.

688
00:43:03,568 --> 00:43:06,029
It's only supposed be
ten percent of the overall sales.

689
00:43:06,113 --> 00:43:07,572
But our pub...

690
00:43:12,744 --> 00:43:13,745
Gosh.

691
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,749
I'm sorry. I know you only wanted to help.

692
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:19,668
I sounded arrogant, didn't I?

693
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,461
What?

694
00:43:22,587 --> 00:43:23,713
No.

695
00:43:24,881 --> 00:43:26,216
You know a lot of stuff.

696
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:28,009
Where did you learn all that?

697
00:43:29,261 --> 00:43:32,264
I've been dreaming of opening my own pub
for seven years.

698
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:34,766
I did some research
and studied a few things.

699
00:43:36,143 --> 00:43:39,146
And I constantly read
Chairman Jang's autobiography.

700
00:43:40,522 --> 00:43:42,566
The book made me realize
how incredible he is.

701
00:43:46,194 --> 00:43:47,487
It helped me out a lot.

702
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:54,995
Should we go now?

703
00:43:57,414 --> 00:44:00,834
Itaewon is a difficult place to succeed.

704
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:03,753
Why don't you

705
00:44:04,463 --> 00:44:06,590
try opening your pub somewhere else?

706
00:44:07,132 --> 00:44:08,133
No.

707
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:10,927
I don't know if I told you,

708
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:14,848
but you haven't changed at all
even after seven years.

709
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:18,226
The same goes for you.
You haven't changed at all either.

710
00:44:19,227 --> 00:44:21,646
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

711
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:26,651
I meant you're still pretty.

712
00:44:29,488 --> 00:44:31,364
I was out of style back then.

713
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:34,034
Don't I look better now?

714
00:44:38,997 --> 00:44:40,123
Hey.

715
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:43,585
They're...

716
00:44:48,131 --> 00:44:49,299
Do you know them?

717
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,845
Actually, no.

718
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:56,014
I thought I did, but I was mistaken.

719
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:00,018
I should go back to work now.

720
00:45:04,105 --> 00:45:05,106
Well...

721
00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:07,150
Soo-ah.

722
00:45:08,068 --> 00:45:09,194
Yes?

723
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,281
If you have time after work,

724
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:16,201
would you like to grab a beer with me?

725
00:45:19,162 --> 00:45:20,997
Okay, sure.

726
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:23,708
I'll call you later.

727
00:45:41,017 --> 00:45:42,644
<i>We're out of soju now.</i>

728
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:45,272
Let's get going.
We need to go to school tomorrow.

729
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:48,733
My gosh, okay. What's the rush?

730
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:51,820
You came back really quickly.
How are other pubs?

731
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:55,198
They're all packed with customers.

732
00:45:57,617 --> 00:46:00,662
<i>Park Sae-ro-yi and me.</i>

733
00:46:01,246 --> 00:46:03,665
<i>Whom would you choose?</i>

734
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:20,265
The same goes for you.
You haven't changed at all either.

735
00:46:22,642 --> 00:46:23,643
Actually,

736
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:26,646
I've changed quite a lot.

737
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:33,028
-I'll be in the kitchen.
-Okay.

738
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,822
Hey part-timer, get me some soju.

739
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:41,202
Did you not hear me?
I want a bottle of soju.

740
00:46:44,998 --> 00:46:47,626
Okay. I'll get you one right away.

741
00:46:52,422 --> 00:46:54,507
-Here.
-Thank you.

742
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:56,009
Seung-kwon.

743
00:46:57,344 --> 00:46:58,553
Is your name part-timer?

744
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:08,688
Press the bell. Don't call him like that.

745
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:14,110
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
I guess he's a little drunk.

746
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:17,739
Please have fun.

747
00:47:17,822 --> 00:47:18,907
I'm sorry.

748
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:22,827
Are you upset?

749
00:47:22,952 --> 00:47:24,329
It's no big deal.

750
00:47:24,704 --> 00:47:26,289
Hey part-timer, stop right there.

751
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:31,169
Do you have a problem
with the way I called you?

752
00:47:31,461 --> 00:47:34,631
You're just a part-timer here.
How am I supposed to call you?

753
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:37,050
Gosh, Seong-hyeon. Stop it.
You've been drinking too much.

754
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:41,221
Let go of me. Do you not see
that he's being disrespectful?

755
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:43,390
Hey.

756
00:47:43,973 --> 00:47:45,600
Is that how you're taught by your boss?

757
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:49,354
Wait over there.

758
00:48:00,156 --> 00:48:02,033
I haven't taught him yet.

759
00:48:03,118 --> 00:48:04,786
But I'm the boss here.

760
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,874
And my employees can treat
nasty customers like that.

761
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,961
What?

762
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:15,922
Don't...

763
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:20,677
Hey, what did you just say?

764
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:22,053
Nasty customer?

765
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,806
Do you have a death wish?

766
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:25,890
-Say that again.
-Stop.

767
00:48:25,974 --> 00:48:27,350
Damn it!

768
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:34,983
Excuse me. Please don't be like this here.

769
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:36,484
What?

770
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:46,828
If you want to punch me,

771
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:49,330
go ahead and do it here, you loser.

772
00:48:56,212 --> 00:48:58,506
My gosh. Hey.

773
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,341
Do you think I can't punch you?

774
00:49:08,516 --> 00:49:11,519
What are you? Why are you breaking in?

775
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,398
I can put up with the whole thing.

776
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,152
But I just can't let him get a blow.

777
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:25,784
I'm really sorry.

778
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,744
We're leaving now.

779
00:49:27,827 --> 00:49:29,329
-So...
-The jerk punched me first.

780
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:30,789
What? Jerk?

781
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:33,333
-Move over.
-I don't need settlement money.

782
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:35,919
Seong-hyeon!

783
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:39,589
Seong-hyeon!

784
00:49:42,342 --> 00:49:43,885
Because we punched each other.

785
00:49:45,094 --> 00:49:46,346
Seung-kwon!

786
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:02,362
Please stop it.

787
00:50:02,445 --> 00:50:04,113
It's over. He passed out.

788
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:05,657
We will just leave--

789
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:14,791
Get up.

790
00:50:27,637 --> 00:50:29,430
Lift your head.

791
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:33,601
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

792
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:35,186
Then you should be punished.

793
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,898
You damn thug!

794
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:44,737
How dare you make a scene like that?

795
00:50:47,156 --> 00:50:49,617
I told you he would never change.

796
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,745
I'm glad you just found it out.

797
00:50:53,288 --> 00:50:54,581
Just fire him.

798
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:06,843
I'm sorry.

799
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:12,223
I'll never do it again.
Please let it go this once.

800
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:16,102
What a psychopath.

801
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,696
Hyun-yi,

802
00:51:27,322 --> 00:51:28,823
call 911.

803
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,867
Okay.

804
00:51:30,992 --> 00:51:31,910
Excuse me.

805
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:56,726
I'm sorry.

806
00:51:57,727 --> 00:51:58,937
We can have a date

807
00:52:01,439 --> 00:52:02,690
maybe next time.

808
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,076
We got a report.

809
00:52:13,618 --> 00:52:14,786
But what's all this...

810
00:52:15,745 --> 00:52:16,996
Well...

811
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:21,000
We had a little spat
with a drunk customer.

812
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:22,085
I see.

813
00:52:22,794 --> 00:52:24,295
A spat?

814
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:29,300
Actually, we're here for something else.

815
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,180
-Pardon?
-We got a report that a minor is here.

816
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:36,140
A minor?

817
00:52:41,145 --> 00:52:45,358
No. We have only
one group of customers now.

818
00:52:45,817 --> 00:52:47,944
There's no minor in here...

819
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:54,909
I guess.

820
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,917
Excuse me. May I see your ID, please?

821
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:19,559
<i>I'm sorry to bother you at this late hour.</i>

822
00:53:20,268 --> 00:53:23,604
I know. It's too late. What's the matter?

823
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:25,940
I got a call from the police
about your brother.

824
00:53:26,524 --> 00:53:27,400
Police?

825
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:29,402
He went to a pub

826
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:31,029
<i>and got caught by the police.</i>

827
00:53:31,112 --> 00:53:34,490
Chairman wants you to go to your brother.

828
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,492
Damn it.

829
00:53:37,577 --> 00:53:38,911
Wait, Mr. Kim.

830
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:41,080
Yes?

831
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:43,332
Do I have a brother?

832
00:53:49,505 --> 00:53:51,215
What a shitty situation.

833
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:53,384
We did check their ID.

834
00:53:53,468 --> 00:53:54,719
They're the ones who lied.

835
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:56,637
Why do we have to suffer damage?

836
00:53:56,721 --> 00:53:58,431
Just ask them. Hey.

837
00:53:58,514 --> 00:54:00,141
Didn't we check your ID?

838
00:54:00,224 --> 00:54:03,186
That's enough.
You're here because you hit someone.

839
00:54:03,269 --> 00:54:05,104
Please calm down.

840
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:07,398
Calm down, my foot.

841
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:09,525
Do you know how much the rent is?

842
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:12,028
If we close the place for a week,
we'll go bankrupt, you know?

843
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:14,989
And what? Two months?
Just because of these shavelings?

844
00:54:15,573 --> 00:54:18,284
He went through a lot to open this pub.

845
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,078
Stop talking to us like that.

846
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:21,662
I said there would be an investigation.

847
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:23,790
I'm talking about the usual cases.

848
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:25,333
We'll deal with it by the law.

849
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:27,585
What kind of law is that?

850
00:54:29,545 --> 00:54:30,963
My gosh.

851
00:54:31,464 --> 00:54:32,423
Enough.

852
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:36,552
Don't yell at the officers.

853
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:38,513
But Sae-ro-yi...

854
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:39,430
You.

855
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:42,266
Did you really not know that?

856
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:47,647
I left it to you,

857
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,649
and you took them in on purpose.
What is it then?

858
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:51,651
It's our fault.

859
00:54:55,071 --> 00:54:57,073
But you didn't do anything wrong.

860
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:05,081
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh.

861
00:55:05,164 --> 00:55:06,666
So it will be two months this time?

862
00:55:06,749 --> 00:55:09,293
Yes. I guess that's how it would go.

863
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:10,294
Wait.

864
00:55:10,795 --> 00:55:13,214
It's true that we lied to them.
It shouldn't hurt his business.

865
00:55:13,297 --> 00:55:16,050
What are you raising your voice for?

866
00:55:16,134 --> 00:55:17,760
Just stay still until your family comes.

867
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:18,761
I don't have one.

868
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:21,430
I'll pay a penalty or take responsibility.

869
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,642
You've got to be kidding me.

870
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:26,060
You stay quiet too.

871
00:55:28,396 --> 00:55:31,315
-Pardon?
-You can't take responsibility.

872
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:33,234
That's why you're a minor.

873
00:55:34,443 --> 00:55:35,403
Kiddie.

874
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:43,536
Let's wrap things up then.

875
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,830
What should we do
to settle the assault case?

876
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:46,956
Well...

877
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,207
For that...

878
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:49,834
Hey.

879
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,294
Thank you for your trouble.

880
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,348
Park Sae-ro-yi?

881
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:13,441
<i>Your brother went to a pub</i>

882
00:56:13,524 --> 00:56:14,984
<i>and got caught by the police.</i>

883
00:56:24,368 --> 00:56:26,537
You're Director Jang.

884
00:56:27,121 --> 00:56:28,873
What brings you here?

885
00:56:30,249 --> 00:56:32,251
Oh, well...

886
00:56:32,752 --> 00:56:33,961
My gosh.

887
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:39,675
This boy is my family.

888
00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:40,968
What?

889
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:44,263
Oh, is that so?

890
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:46,182
And this guy is my friend from school.

891
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,687
Oh, no. He got expelled before graduation.

892
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:53,940
So we aren't technically alumni.

893
00:56:57,902 --> 00:57:02,240
Gosh, we met again.
What a strange coincidence.

894
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:06,410
It's nice to see you again, Sae-ro-yi.

895
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:08,621
What are you doing?

896
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:15,336
I'm tired. Let's get this over with.

897
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,546
Oh, okay.

898
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:18,506
Wait.

899
00:57:19,715 --> 00:57:20,841
Hang on.

900
00:57:22,093 --> 00:57:25,721
I guess my friend is in trouble
because of my family.

901
00:57:26,555 --> 00:57:28,140
I feel bad about that.

902
00:57:33,771 --> 00:57:34,772
What do you think?

903
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:37,066
Do you need help?

904
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:42,655
If he's your friend,

905
00:57:43,531 --> 00:57:45,283
I guess there might be a way.

906
00:57:47,576 --> 00:57:48,869
Please don't worry.

907
00:57:57,545 --> 00:57:58,629
Excuse me?

908
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:05,261
My dream

909
00:58:06,387 --> 00:58:07,847
was being a cop.

910
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,099
What?

911
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,729
But I lost my temper once
and became an ex-convict.

912
00:58:15,313 --> 00:58:17,440
An ex-convict can't
become a police officer.

913
00:58:18,357 --> 00:58:20,484
I understood it and gave up my dream.

914
00:58:22,987 --> 00:58:25,406
Because the police
are supposed to defend the law.

915
00:58:27,867 --> 00:58:30,411
They must be cleaner
and more righteous than anyone.

916
00:58:30,494 --> 00:58:33,706
That's the police
whom I dreamed of and admired.

917
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:37,793
But you.

918
00:58:39,337 --> 00:58:40,755
What do you think you're doing?

919
00:58:41,964 --> 00:58:44,592
So what is he?
Is he the president or something?

920
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:49,638
Why does his word have the power
against police forces?

921
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:54,060
Well...

922
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:56,228
Please don't get me wrong.

923
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:57,563
We're not friends.

924
00:58:58,856 --> 00:59:01,067
-Let's do things by the law.
-Wait.

925
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:04,195
Sae-ro-yi.

926
00:59:10,826 --> 00:59:11,827
Well...

927
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:27,927
Excuse me.

928
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:34,266
Are you out of your mind?

929
00:59:35,351 --> 00:59:37,520
-What?
-Why are you being like this?

930
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:39,647
What do you mean?

931
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:41,816
You might be ordered to suspend business.

932
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,401
So what?

933
00:59:43,484 --> 00:59:45,403
Since I accepted minors,
I should be punished.

934
00:59:45,486 --> 00:59:48,197
But you can avoid it with that guy's help.

935
00:59:48,656 --> 00:59:50,366
He's willing to help. What's the problem?

936
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:52,952
Help?

937
00:59:53,452 --> 00:59:55,162
I'd rather die than get his help.

938
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:59,959
I see.
So is this about your pride or something?

939
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:02,211
Even if you have to shut
down the business,

940
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:04,588
you want to keep your pride?

941
01:00:11,011 --> 01:00:13,848
What is it?
Why are you getting on my nerves?

942
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:15,641
I just don't get it.

943
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,270
You need to learn to compromise
when you run a business.

944
01:00:19,353 --> 01:00:21,188
How would you run a business
being so stubborn?

945
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:25,734
You told me this before.
What the hell you know about me?

946
01:00:25,818 --> 01:00:28,487
I don't know anything. I really don't.

947
01:00:31,115 --> 01:00:34,743
-But if you let it slide just this once--
-Just this once?

948
01:00:37,705 --> 01:00:40,791
Just this once? Once and for all?
But there will be another time.

949
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:46,839
It will make things easy this once.

950
01:00:47,423 --> 01:00:48,591
But you know what?

951
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,051
Those one times

952
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:53,804
might change your whole life.

953
01:00:58,767 --> 01:00:59,685
How condescending.

954
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:02,146
What?

955
01:01:03,189 --> 01:01:04,565
Once you're suspended,

956
01:01:04,648 --> 01:01:07,443
there will be no once. It's just over.

957
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:09,153
Business suspension?

958
01:01:09,737 --> 01:01:10,988
I can just open it again.

959
01:01:11,572 --> 01:01:13,365
It's no big deal.

960
01:01:18,078 --> 01:01:20,331
That's impressive.

961
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:22,583
It does sound like you, Park Sae-ro-yi.

962
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:24,418
You haven't changed.

963
01:01:25,044 --> 01:01:27,588
A naive rough-and-tumble amateur.

964
01:01:30,257 --> 01:01:31,759
I understand you though.

965
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:34,178
You went to prison because of me,

966
01:01:34,261 --> 01:01:37,056
you got expelled from school
because of me,

967
01:01:40,142 --> 01:01:43,395
and you think your dad
died because of me, right?

968
01:01:45,439 --> 01:01:47,483
My gosh.

969
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:51,820
You know what?

970
01:01:57,785 --> 01:01:59,245
You're right about that.

971
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,004
He's a middle school graduate,
an ex-convict, and an orphan.

972
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:12,049
Poor Sae-ro-yi who ruined his life
because of me.

973
01:02:12,258 --> 01:02:15,970
Gosh, I feel so bad for you.

974
01:02:23,018 --> 01:02:26,230
-Jang Geun-won.
-Gosh, you sound scary.

975
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,941
My goodness.

976
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:32,903
Do you want to punch me?

977
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:34,405
Like you did before?

978
01:02:36,907 --> 01:02:39,368
Go ahead and do it. You're good at it.

979
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:41,495
Assault.

980
01:02:49,503 --> 01:02:50,838
Go ahead.

981
01:02:50,963 --> 01:02:53,173
Hit me. Give me a blow.

982
01:02:53,257 --> 01:02:55,175
Punch me. Just do it.

983
01:02:57,094 --> 01:02:58,971
Aren't you going to hit me? Do it.

984
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:01,265
Go ahead. Hit me.

985
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,689
I guess you've grown up.

986
01:03:08,772 --> 01:03:10,524
Good for you.

987
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:14,069
You want to make a living
with that tiny store.

988
01:03:14,153 --> 01:03:16,655
You need to be patient, right?

989
01:03:21,243 --> 01:03:22,369
Nine years.

990
01:03:26,373 --> 01:03:28,167
I've been putting up
with it the whole time.

991
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:31,712
And I'll do it for another six years.

992
01:03:34,006 --> 01:03:35,132
What are you talking about?

993
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:37,134
The statute of limitations.

994
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:46,477
I have a plan

995
01:03:50,981 --> 01:03:52,650
for 15 years.

996
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:07,922
Subtitle translation by Liya Choi

997
01:04:21,845 --> 01:04:24,932
He's suffering because of my family again.

998
01:04:25,015 --> 01:04:28,936
<i>I can't wait to see your frowning face
with your business closed down.</i>

999
01:04:29,019 --> 01:04:31,271
<i>You can't do anything
if you believe that is the case.</i>

1000
01:04:31,355 --> 01:04:32,648
<i>I have to give it a try.</i>

1001
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:33,816
<i>I'll begin with all of that.</i>

1002
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:35,401
<i>And I'll do everything I want to do.</i>

1003
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:37,111
<i>Ever since I met that guy,</i>

1004
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:40,114
<i>I can't seem to find interest
in anything else.</i>

1005
01:04:40,197 --> 01:04:43,409
Attempted murder? Previous conviction...

1006
01:04:43,492 --> 01:04:45,911
If I meddle in here,
does that mean I'm nosy?

1007
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:49,623
<i>Do you like Sae-ro-yi?</i>

1008
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:52,084
<i>His pub is suspended because of you,</i>

1009
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:53,961
but you don't seem sorry at all.

1010
01:04:54,044 --> 01:04:56,255
Is it you who called the police?
