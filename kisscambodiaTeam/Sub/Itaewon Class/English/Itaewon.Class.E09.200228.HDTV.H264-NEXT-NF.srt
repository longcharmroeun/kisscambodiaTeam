ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,317
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:26,871
Is this working?

5
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:30,291
Hi, everyone. Let me introduce DanBam
on Gyeongridan-gil road.

6
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:33,335
Ta-da. Hyun-yi, say hi.

7
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,671
-Are we on live again? Hi!
-Hi!

8
00:00:35,754 --> 00:00:37,882
SHE ALREADY LOOKS SO PRETTY

9
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:40,176
YI-SEO, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR JACKET?

10
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,678
Let me introduce my boss. Boss!

11
00:00:43,387 --> 00:00:46,932
-Hi! Say hi. I'm live-streaming.
-Oh!

12
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:48,309
YOU TWO SHOULD DATE

13
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:50,144
Yes, hello.

14
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:53,564
Boss, how do you feel now
that DanBam is on Gyeongridan-gil road?

15
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:54,732
DON'T YOU NEED A PART-TIMER?

16
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:56,442
How do I feel? What do I say?

17
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:57,610
Just say anything.

18
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:59,111
YOU'RE CUTE

19
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:01,822
-We'll work hard.
-Gosh. "We'll work hard."

20
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:04,200
My boss is so boring.

21
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:05,451
THAT WAS CUTE

22
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:08,287
Then what are your goals as the boss?
Share with us.

23
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:09,872
-My goals?
-Yes.

24
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:11,707
GOSH, HE'S NO FUN

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,959
I GUESS HE'S NEVER DONE
LIVE STREAMING BEFORE

26
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:15,753
WE'LL FORGIVE HIM BECAUSE HE'S HANDSOME

27
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:16,921
-Come on.
-Okay.

28
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:19,089
DANBAM? DO THEY HAVE GOOD FOOD?

29
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:20,591
My staff and I...

30
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:22,218
THEY REOPENED ON GYEONGRIDAN-GIL ROAD

31
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,969
...will work hard

32
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:27,640
to make DanBam
the number one pub in the country.

33
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:28,557
Wow.

34
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,601
-Number one.
-Number one.

35
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:32,353
-Shall we shout together?
-Okay.

36
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,188
One, two, three.

37
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,773
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

38
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:41,987
EPISODE 9

39
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:42,988
<i>Last but not least...</i>

40
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:47,368
There are more than five million
business owners in the country.

41
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:49,828
And out of those five million,

42
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,332
a million businesses shut down every year.

43
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:55,334
Why do they go out of business?

44
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:57,503
Because the economy is bad?

45
00:01:57,878 --> 00:01:58,837
No.

46
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,592
It's because customers don't have a reason
to choose it over the other ones.

47
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:06,470
Your foods, decor, and system
must set you apart.

48
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:08,013
If you open something without a plan

49
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:10,849
or putting much thought into it,
you'll go out of business.

50
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:13,727
Outdo your neighboring businesses.

51
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:16,480
Have something unique that sets you apart.

52
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:18,357
Figure out

53
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:21,360
how you can win the competition
and keep trying things.

54
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,363
I was able to grow Jangga
from the tiny pub under the bridge

55
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:26,699
forty years ago to what it is today

56
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:30,369
because I ceaselessly pondered solutions,
and I will never stop.

57
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:33,914
All these concerns and attempts

58
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:36,792
are what got me to where I am today.

59
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:39,878
You can

60
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:42,423
do it too.

61
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,219
Thank you for listening to
this businessman,

62
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:49,346
Jang Dae-hee.

63
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,724
SEMINAR BY CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

64
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,112
I'm sorry.
We're not accepting any questions--

65
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:08,741
BUSINESS

66
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:09,825
Give her a microphone.

67
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:19,543
Hello, sir. I enjoyed the seminar.

68
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:22,713
We've met before.
It's good to see you again.

69
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm curious to hear your question.

70
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:29,428
Well, my boss always says

71
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,180
that business is all about people.

72
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:35,392
This has nothing to do with the seminar.
I'm purely asking as a fan of yours.

73
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:40,856
Do you also have such a motto
about running a business?

74
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,151
"Business is all about people"?

75
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:46,904
Your boss sounds like a romantic.

76
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,451
Let me think.
What does running a business means to me?

77
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,122
No matter what word you use
to sugarcoat it,

78
00:03:57,706 --> 00:03:59,041
you can't change its definition.

79
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:02,878
The ultimate goal of a business
is to obtain profits.

80
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:10,135
You said you grew a tiny pub
under a bridge into what Jangga is today.

81
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,263
I truly admire you.

82
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:16,308
And I loved that you used the word,
"competition."

83
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:19,144
Then I want to ask you
about the competition.

84
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,397
Do you think it's possible

85
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:25,609
for a small pub
to beat what Jangga is today?

86
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:42,668
I love seeing ambitious young people
like yourself,

87
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,505
but I'm still full of ambition as well,

88
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,677
so such a thing

89
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:54,471
will never happen until the day I die.

90
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,979
With that bold statement,
I'd like to end this seminar.

91
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,235
Thank you for attending our seminar
hosted by Chairman Jang Dae-hee.

92
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:32,634
I didn't think
I'd see you at this seminar.

93
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:34,928
Was it helpful?

94
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:38,223
Yes. I learned a lot, sir.

95
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:39,933
I heard you moved to Gyeongridan-gil road.

96
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:41,894
How's business?

97
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:45,773
We're working hard, but it's not easy.

98
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:49,109
I see. Keep up the good work.

99
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:51,987
Goodbye, sir.

100
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:03,332
In my opinion, power comes from people.

101
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,920
Because their trust gives me strength.

102
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,588
If your business fails,

103
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,174
you'll lose your people.

104
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:15,344
They're the reason why
I can continue to run my business.

105
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:19,348
Right.

106
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:22,810
Mr. Kim.

107
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:25,229
Yes, sir.

108
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:31,902
Ms. Jo.

109
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,869
Chairman Jang would like to see you.

110
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:51,463
Chairman Jang,
the guest you're expecting is here.

111
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,131
Okay, let her in.

112
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:55,425
You were expecting someone?

113
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,699
You're...

114
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:22,160
Thanks for coming.

115
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:24,746
Have you eaten yet?

116
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:27,457
No, not yet.

117
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,792
Shall we have some food first?

118
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:47,619
This was so good.

119
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:49,747
Thank you, sir.

120
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,081
My pleasure.

121
00:07:57,254 --> 00:07:59,339
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

122
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:03,135
Why don't you join Jangga?

123
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:06,054
I'll treat you well.

124
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:14,897
Thank you for the offer,

125
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,483
but I'm afraid I must decline.

126
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:20,778
May I ask why?

127
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,655
Because of my boss.

128
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:33,415
I know young people these days
value friendship a great deal,

129
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,959
but it hasn't even been a year.

130
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:38,295
It's only a shallow friendship.

131
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,715
Like you said,

132
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,885
I shouldn't decline your offer
merely because of friendship.

133
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:48,764
But aren't you making this offer
because of my boss?

134
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:55,270
You're immensely interested
in my boss as well as in DanBam.

135
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:57,272
So?

136
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:03,654
I'm confident that I can grow DanBam.

137
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:09,451
If you come to notice me, not my boss,
in that process,

138
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,413
you can give me
this offer again then, sir.

139
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:39,731
Jo Yi-seo.

140
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:43,193
The manager of Park Saeroyi's pub.

141
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:46,947
Park Saeroyi, that prick.

142
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:48,782
<i>Because of Mr. Park.</i>

143
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:51,660
He was like a father to me.

144
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:15,642
Damn it.

145
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:22,065
Jeez, you need to look ahead
when you're driving.

146
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:28,822
Hey, you can't drive at full speed here.

147
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:35,412
God damn it.

148
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,835
Shall I call my insurer
or just give you money?

149
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,547
-What?
-Just answer my question. I'm busy.

150
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,132
Jeez, what the...

151
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,718
First, you need to apologize to me
for hitting my car.

152
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,470
Are you that rich?

153
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:56,391
Will you say no to money
if I apologize to you?

154
00:10:57,726 --> 00:10:59,478
I am rich.

155
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,438
I'm offering you money!

156
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:02,397
What the hell.

157
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:09,488
Here.

158
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:15,369
How's the business going?

159
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:19,539
Not bad. Yi-seo has done some marketing.

160
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:22,209
"Not bad" is an understatement.

161
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,628
We should get ready for the tax season.

162
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:28,507
How much will I be taxed?

163
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,761
Well, I can't really figure out
the exact amount yet.

164
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,846
But at this rate, a lot.

165
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:37,975
What should I do, then?

166
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:41,895
You don't need to worry.
It's my specialty, you know.

167
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:45,023
Let's do this.

168
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:26,606
I'M GOING TO INCORPORATE DANBAM

169
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,650
<i>I'm going to incorporate DanBam.</i>

170
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:29,985
PARK SAEROYI

171
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:32,738
<i>You'll incorporate the business?
So DanBam will become a company?</i>

172
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,240
<i>Wow, that means you'll be a CEO.</i>

173
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:38,326
<i>CEO? What does it mean
to incorporate the business?</i>

174
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:39,745
<i>Incorporate DanBam...</i>

175
00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:42,539
<i>What all the money we're pulling in,
we should. For tax purposes.</i>

176
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,375
<i>So we need to come up with a name.</i>

177
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,462
<i>A company name. Throw some ideas.</i>

178
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:49,838
DANBAM PUB

179
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:51,256
<i>"Parkga."</i>

180
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,758

00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:57,262

00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:59,264
<i>What about "ILL"?</i>

184
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:02,100
<i>I think it sounds cool.</i>

185
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,478
<i>Yi-seo, Royi, love.</i>

00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,605
PARK SAEROYI

187
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:08,774
<i>Not sure. I don't love it.</i>

188
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:11,359
<i>What about you, Seung-kwon? Got any ideas?</i>

189
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:12,944
<i>Well...</i>

190
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,113
<i>"Itaewon...</i>

191
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:17,199
<i>Class"?</i>

192
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:19,409
<i>Gosh, what is that?</i>

193
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,744
<i>It sounds so lame.</i>

194
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,454
<i>It sounds so uncool, just like him.</i>

195
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:24,873
<i>I actually like it.</i>

196
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:27,084
<i>Right? I like it too.</i>

197
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,960
<i>"Itaewon Class."</i>

198
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,171
<i>It's catchy. It's a good name.</i>

199
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:33,173
<i>You guys don't like it?</i>

200
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:35,300
<i>No, I don't.</i>

201
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:38,512
<i>"Class," seriously? It sounds so childish.</i>

202
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,972
<i>It sounds like something
a teenage bluffer would say.</i>

ITAEWON

206
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,344
<i>The first word that came to my mind
when I heard "Itaewon Class"</i>

207
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:21,930
was "freedom."

208
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:26,601
A place where
different cultures can mingle freely.

209
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:28,728
Being free from restraints.

210
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:32,190
Itaewon symbolizes freedom.

211
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:35,694
That's what you were going for, right?

212
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:41,199
-Yes.
-<i>Bullshit.</i>

213
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:43,201
It sounds a little forced,

214
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,370
but it's not bad.

215
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,455
It's got that old-school vibe.

216
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:52,377
What can we do? You already love the name.

217
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:54,462
You'll go with it anyway.

218
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,673
No.

219
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,967
I won't if you don't like it.

220
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:04,890
Well...

221
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:07,726
I'm fine with it if you like it.

222
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,561
It's fine,

223
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:12,397
but limiting ourselves to Itaewon only
won't help us

224
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,317
when dealing with other businesses.
It makes us look small.

225
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:20,614
Then "Itaewon Class" can be a name
that we use amongst ourselves.

226
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:22,741
How about we just use the initials?

227
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:29,289
"IC"?

228
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:31,124
"IC"?

229
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,336
-"IC."
-What?

230
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:38,798
Wow, using English.

231
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:41,843
Nice. It's a memorable name.

232
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:44,179
"IC."

233
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:48,475
I like it.

234
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,853
Then since the manager likes it too,

235
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:55,315
we're now the founding members of IC Inc.,

236
00:15:57,484 --> 00:16:00,654

241
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,712
Hey, Hye-won.

242
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:19,673
Hello.

243
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:21,841
It's her school's anniversary,
so I brought her.

244
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:23,385
It's good to see you.

245
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,263
Guys, help him with his stuff.

246
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:27,639
-Sure.
-Sure.

247
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:30,600
-It's your first time here, right?
-Yes.

248
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:33,436
Hi, Yi-seo.

249
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:37,691
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

250
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:38,775
You're hungry?

251
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,987
-Hyun-yi, can you make some food for her?
-Oh, sure.

252
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,531
-Hey, take this.
-You bring it.

253
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:45,657
That little...

254
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,743
Have a seat here.
The food will be ready soon.

255
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:49,995
Okay.

256
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,038
Boss, I'm going to go check the order.

257
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:54,040
All right.

258
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,961
Saeroyi, spare me a moment.

259
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,047
Wait here.

00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:07,345

261
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:09,514
How's business?

262
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:11,599
It's going pretty well.

263
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:14,769
But not as well as when we were
in Itaewon.

264
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:16,354
It's hard to run a pub in an alley.

265
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:19,190
I was very surprised.

266
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:22,068
You were able to relocate
and buy this building.

267
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:24,779
How did you manage to save so much money?

268
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:27,949
Thanks to my friend,
who's a competent fund manager.

269
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:30,869
-I'll introduce you to him next time.
-All right.

270
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:35,040
Well, you see...

271
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,045
What's the matter?

272
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:44,799
Well, about the thing we talked about
last time...

273
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:49,220
Hold on.

274
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,348
Where did Hye-won go?

275
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:54,267
Hye-won.

276
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:56,353
Hye-won.

277
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:57,729
Hye-won?

278
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:02,901
Hye-won!

279
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,488
Hye-won!

280
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:08,073
Did you guys see Hye-won?

281
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,408
No, we were busy checking this.
Did she leave?

282
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:14,245
-Geun-soo, go this way with Toni.
-Okay. Hey, Toni.

283
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:16,873
Yi-seo, you stay here. Let's go this way.

284
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,584
Hye-won!

285
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:21,961
Hye-won!

286
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:28,176
Why isn't Saeroyi picking up?

287
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:29,594
Ma'am.

288
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:34,474
Me?

289
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:37,102
I got lost while following a cat.

290
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:39,354
I didn't bring my phone.

291
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,439
May I please borrow your phone?

292
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,485
Don't call me "Ma'am."

293
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,196
You seem to be around
the same age as my dad.

294
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:50,448
But I'm not married.

295
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:52,033
Really?

296
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:55,161
But you're pretty.

297
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:56,996
Why aren't you married?

298
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,707
Just make your phone call.

299
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,379
Dad, I'm sorry.

300
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,215
I got lost,
so I'm using someone else's phone now.

301
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:09,259
Here?

302
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,594
I don't agree with that.

303
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,308
Come on. Tell me their names.

304
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:19,310
-Kim Ji-eun and--
-Hye-won!

305
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:27,110
-My gosh.
-Dad, I can't breathe.

306
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,779
-Ms. Kang.
-Hey.

307
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:31,948
Why did you leave without even telling me?

308
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:34,492
Sorry, Dad. You must've been worried.

309
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:35,452
Yes, of course!

310
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:38,163
This lady here helped me.

311
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:43,585
-Thank you.
-No problem.

312
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:45,378
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

313
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,797
She's adorable.
I had fun chatting with her.

314
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,925
He's our supplier,
and this is his daughter.

315
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,260
I see.

316
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,138
Were you on your way to meet me?

317
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:57,640
-Yes, I'd love to check out your pub.
-Okay.

318
00:19:58,516 --> 00:19:59,767
Let's talk there.

319
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,021
Sorry again, Dad.

320
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,152
-Hye-won.
-Yes?

321
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:10,695
Go with Saeroyi.

322
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:14,032
I have to make an important phone call.
I'll meet you at the pub.

323
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,829
ITAEWON CHILDREN'S PARK

324
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:22,123
Who are you?

325
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,046
-Let go, you bastard!
-You punk!

326
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:29,005
Hey!

327
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,397
Is your dad trained in martial arts?

328
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:49,692
My dad used to be a cop. He's very strong.

329
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,530
He's so dependable.

330
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,451
He's single too.

331
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,079
What?

332
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:09,504
What happened?

333
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,846
I only see photos from today.

334
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:22,934
He probably deletes all the photos daily.

335
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:28,940
He's keeping track of where you go,
who you meet, and what you do.

336
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:30,692
Everything you do...

337
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:37,115
What's wrong? Did you find anything?

338
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:39,242
No, it's not that.

339
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:43,162
Anyway, I wonder
who ordered him to do this.

340
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,331
Chairman Jang.

341
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,625
Yes.

342
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:49,836
He's the only one
who'd do something like this.

343
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,422
This means that
he may know about our partnership.

344
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:03,349
Right, I should thank you
for all your help earlier.

345
00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:05,768
Gosh, no problem at all.

346
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:08,313
Your daughter is so smart and brave.
You raised her well.

347
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:12,817
Thankfully, she doesn't take after me.

348
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,528
But you raised her.

349
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:21,326
Children follow their parents' footsteps.

350
00:22:22,493 --> 00:22:24,245
She kept bragging about you.

351
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:26,914
It sounded like you're a great dad.

352
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:37,842
Hye-won, we should go home.
Say bye to everyone.

353
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:42,680
See you soon, Ms. Kang and Saeroyi.

354
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:45,350
-Be a good girl.
-I will.

355
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:47,810
-Well, take care.
-You too.

356
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:49,729
Detective Oh.

357
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:54,525
Weren't you going
to say something earlier?

358
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:56,861
Oh, that...

359
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:01,991
I'll tell you later. Another time.

360
00:23:04,243 --> 00:23:05,244
I'll be waiting.

361
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:22,387
<i>It's doing pretty well.</i>

362
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,722
There are a few interesting things.

363
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,557
They took care of the renovation
and inspected

364
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,476
the entire process themselves.

365
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,145
The space is over 40 <i>pyeong</i>,

366
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:34,565
yet they only spent 25 million won,
including the demolition cost.

367
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,777
It sounds like you've seen the space.

368
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:40,321
Yes, I have.

369
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:43,825
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

370
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:46,494
They opened a live channel
and posted the entire process,

371
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:48,246
from looking for a store space

372
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:50,873
to the renovations and the inspections.

373
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:53,334
It's very popular
among small business owners

374
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:56,713
and young customers who are foodies.

375
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,883
<i>Let me introduce
the part-timers at DanBam.</i>

376
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,428
<i>The face of DanBam.</i>

377
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:04,762
<i>Jang Geun-soo!</i>

378
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:06,597
HANDSOME

379
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,975
<i>I'm Jang Geun-soo, a server.</i>

380
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:11,894
<i>Hi, Geun-soo. What's your hobby?</i>

381
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:12,937
<i>-My hobby?
-Yes.</i>

382
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:16,357
<i>I'm good at spinning soju bottles.</i>

383
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:20,194
<i>-I see. That's his hobby.
-I'll show you.</i>

384
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,029
<i>-Like this.
-Gosh.</i>

385
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:25,616
<i>Do that first.</i>

386
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:29,704
<i>Mr. Kim is waiting, sir.</i>

387
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:31,247
Let him in.

388
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:40,506
I'll come back another time.

389
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,633
It's okay. What is it?

390
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,556
<i>I make awesome soju bombs.</i>

391
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:51,684
<i>Then do you make soju bombs for customers?</i>

392
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:54,479
<i>Yes, of course. That's a given.</i>

393
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:58,441
<i>Everyone, visit DanBam
for the awesome soju bombs.</i>

394
00:24:58,524 --> 00:24:59,984
VISIT DANBAM PUB

395
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:06,491
Ms. Kang found out
that we've been tailing her.

396
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:13,998
-I'll be off, then.
-No, stay.

397
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:20,755
-But she doesn't know that you--
-I'm sure she knows.

398
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,550
Who else would be that interested
in Min-jung?

399
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:26,010
It doesn't matter.

400
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:29,722
More importantly, that girl, Jo Yi-seo...

401
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:32,975
We're trying to figure out
the position and pay scale.

402
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,478
I'll approach her with an offer
when it's finalized.

403
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:37,522
Good. You must bring her on board.

404
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:41,776
-Sir.
-She must've won him over.

405
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:50,868
VISIT DANBAM PUB

406
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:54,330
If you come to notice me, not my boss,
in that process,

407
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:56,958
you can give me
this offer again then, sir.

408
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:02,755
She's interesting.

409
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:05,758
Pardon me?

410
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:08,553
She doesn't suit that punk, Park Saeroyi.

411
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,055
She's like me.

412
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:17,895
-Have you looked into the other stuff?
-Yes, sir.

413
00:26:18,563 --> 00:26:22,191
All their ingredients
are supplied by Hyewon Foods.

414
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:25,403
They use good ingredients.
I've never heard of that company though.

415
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:27,947
The owner is an ex-cop. Maybe that's why.

416
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,574
Everyone says that he's very thorough.

417
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:31,200
He's an ex-cop?

418
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:33,661
He left the police about ten years ago

419
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:35,955
and started a produce supply business.

420
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:38,249
The thing is though,
his company is based in Pajin

421
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:40,209
and mostly deals with businesses
in the area.

422
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,795
But he supplies produce to DanBam,
which is an hour away,

423
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:44,922
so I think they might have
a personal relationship.

424
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:48,342
Pajin?

425
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,681
Maybe he knew Mr. Park.

426
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:00,187
Set up a meeting with him.
I'd like to meet him myself.

427
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:05,151
What on earth is going on?

428
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,446
Tailing Ms. Kang? And what's
with Jo Yi-seo and the supplier?

429
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:09,530
You heard everything.

430
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,491
Why would Jangga go to such lengths
to take down that small pub--

431
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:13,618
Ms. Oh.

432
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,747
Is your opinion necessary?

433
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:20,791
-Sorry?
-We're mere employees,

434
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,043
so we just need to do

435
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:24,378
as the chairman says.

436
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:31,719
What's going on?

437
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,723
Are you two fighting?

438
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:38,100
I'm off.

439
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,397
What's with her?

440
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,858
It's nothing, sir.

441
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,654
How's Dad? Is he doing all right?

442
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:50,947
Yes, sir.

443
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,659
Take good care of him.
He's been a little sensitive lately.

444
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:58,412
If my dad needs something,

445
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,498
you should also let me know.

446
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,171
Sir.

447
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:19,058
He seems to like Jo Yi-seo,
the young lady who works at DanBam.

448
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,144
This could be your chance
to win the chairman's trust.

449
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:26,023
Why don't you take charge
and convince her to work at our company?

450
00:28:34,532 --> 00:28:35,616
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

451
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,410
It's hard to do business in the alley.

452
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:39,453
It's even harder when it's a pub.

453
00:28:39,537 --> 00:28:41,872
The borough office parking lot
closes at 11:00 p.m.

454
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:45,334
You have no idea how many times
I asked them to always keep it open.

455
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:47,503
It sounds like a good idea.
Why didn't they do it?

456
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:48,921
That's not it.

457
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:51,716
You know that footbridge at Noksapyeong
where you can see Namsan?

458
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,884
As you already know,
it has an amazing view.

459
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:55,469
I suggested that we should

460
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:58,305
turn it into a tourist spot
and decorate it nicely with an artist,

461
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,391
but they never listened to me.

462
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:04,603
That sounds nice too.
Why didn't they do it?

463
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:06,063
Apparently,

464
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:09,025
no one's ever done
anything like that before.

465
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:13,654
I can give them all sorts of ideas,
but they always just ignore me.

466
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:14,864
It's useless.

467
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:24,123
DANBAM

468
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:27,334
It's important to have regulars
when your business is in the alley.

469
00:29:27,918 --> 00:29:30,963
I'm sure it'll get better,
so just hang in there.

470
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:32,840
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

471
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:36,594
Baldy.

472
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:39,180
I guess you've matured enough
to give advice now.

473
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:41,140
Long time no see.

474
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:42,767
Do you know her?

475
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:46,187
Yes. Did you borrow money from her?

476
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:48,439
No, she's our regular.

477
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,649
I'm relieved to hear that.

478
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:53,652
Always borrow money from the bank.
Otherwise, you'll get in trouble.

479
00:29:53,736 --> 00:29:55,362
What are you saying?

480
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:57,448
Have you forgotten the past?

481
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:00,284
My gosh, you still have a temper.

482
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,369
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

483
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:05,289
-Stay healthy, ma'am.
-Okay, bye.

484
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:08,250
I'm here to eat.

485
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:12,797
What's going on? Have you closed already?

486
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,466
No. Toni, please take her to a table.

487
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:18,135
-Hello.
-My gosh, you startled me.

488
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,097
I guess there aren't any customers.

489
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,556
No.

490
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,226
What did I tell you?
It's a bad place to do business.

491
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:28,521
You're practically cursing us.

492
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:30,189
Yi-seo.

493
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:32,566
What's wrong with this neighborhood?

494
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:38,322
That rude little brat.

495
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:41,575
Do you think I'm wrong?

496
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:46,539
Look around you.
All the other places are closed already.

497
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:49,333
I'll try to revive it.

498
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:52,670
That's absurd.
How are you going to do that?

499
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:54,713
The entire neighborhood is dead.

500
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,509
Ma'am, I'll get you some food.

501
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:01,512
Just sell the place and get out of here.
It's the best you can do.

502
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:04,056
PARK SAEROYI

503
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:31,250
MARUDANG RESTAURANT

504
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:36,881
Thank you.

505
00:31:37,506 --> 00:31:39,300
-Have some juice.
-Thank you.

506
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:48,601
JOJO'S PLACE

507
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:55,441
What is he doing?

508
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:57,651
How would I know?

509
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:01,655
Why are you here?

510
00:32:02,364 --> 00:32:07,286
As you can see, our boss is really busy
doing a bunch of useless stuff.

511
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:08,871
I'm here to see you.

512
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:10,873
What?

513
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,709
I heard you met the chairman.

514
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:17,546
He thinks you're just like him.

515
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:21,467
He thinks I'm just like him?
What a horrible thing to say.

516
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:24,511
But I'm not that offended.

517
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:29,934
Did you say you're working here
because of Saeroyi?

518
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,479
-Yes.
-You say he's the only reason.

519
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:36,941
But what if he rejects you?

520
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:39,693
-Because of you?
-Yes.

521
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,446
Then what would happen?

522
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,073
Would that make you quit?

523
00:32:46,242 --> 00:32:47,451
That won't happen.

524
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:51,830
I've never lost before.

525
00:32:59,004 --> 00:32:59,922
Soo-ah.

526
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,471
What are you doing?

527
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,474
What?

528
00:33:14,228 --> 00:33:16,897
Oh, the Vietnamese restaurant
seems to have

529
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:20,943
an inefficient menu and table arrangement,
so I'm going to help.

530
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:22,987
Why do you want to help?

531
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:26,282
-What?
-What's with the sudden charity work?

532
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:27,992
Hey, what's your problem this time?

533
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,327
I just don't get it.

534
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:32,329
I want an explanation so I can understand.

535
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:43,549
I'm doing it survive.

536
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,510
What are you talking about?

537
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:48,762
Our pub isn't even doing that well.

538
00:33:48,846 --> 00:33:50,597
You should focus on our pub rather than--

539
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:52,016
What more do we need?

540
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:56,687
What more can we do to improve DanBam?

541
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:01,775
Thanks to you,
our marketing strategy is doing well.

542
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:03,819
And the interior came out great.

543
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:06,905
What more do we need to improve? The food?

544
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:10,451
You said everything tastes great.

545
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:12,661
So what?

546
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:15,956
Are you trying to befriend the neighbors
and make them become our regulars?

547
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,916
All the businesses
in this alley are dying.

548
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,252
Nothing will improve
just by focusing on our pub.

549
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:23,881
We need to revitalize the alley.

550
00:34:32,056 --> 00:34:34,433
I really can't believe this.

551
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:37,061
What?

552
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:40,147
You're a dreamer, an idealist...

553
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:45,611
We really aren't a great match.

554
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,372
Don't mind her.

555
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,540
She's supposed to do what she's told.

556
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:02,002
Didn't you tell us we're a team

557
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:04,546
when you incorporated the business?

558
00:35:08,884 --> 00:35:10,010
What?

559
00:35:10,135 --> 00:35:11,387
It's easy to do as we're told.

560
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:13,222
But...

561
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:16,642
is that the kind of team you wanted?

562
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:24,316
We're mere employees,
so we just need to do

563
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:26,652
as the chairman says.

564
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:30,155
Well...

565
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:33,242
We might be nothing
but ordinary employees.

566
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:35,577
-Geun-soo...
-But

567
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,415
Yi-seo is different.

568
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:41,792
She's the manager.

569
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:44,753
This may be a small corporation,
but she's still a stockholder.

570
00:35:44,837 --> 00:35:46,004
On top of that,

571
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,176
she bet her life on you.

572
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:55,889
The least you can do
is try to convince her.

573
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:59,601
Geun-soo, what's with you today?

574
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:04,106
Yi-seo just seems
a little different these days.

575
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:09,153
She's different with Saeroyi.

576
00:36:25,502 --> 00:36:27,546
Everything Geun-soo said was right.

577
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,466
I didn't know what to say.

578
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,135
By the way,

579
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:34,928
about Geun-soo--

580
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:36,096
I know.

581
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:38,515
He's Chairman Jang's second son.

582
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:46,398
I understand that you don't really care.

583
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:48,692
But what about him?

584
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:52,362
I wonder why he's working at DanBam.

585
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:54,740
I'm not sure.

586
00:36:58,577 --> 00:37:00,204
Maybe he wants to make money.

587
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,209
Then what about Yi-seo?

588
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:09,713
Why do you think Yi-seo is working there?

589
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:11,757
What?

590
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:18,055
I'm sure you need her to succeed.

591
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:22,684
Why? What are you curious about?

592
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:27,648
Now, I feel like there are so many reasons

593
00:37:28,857 --> 00:37:31,109
why we can't be together.

594
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:37,115
What's the matter? Did something happen?

595
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:40,869
What kind of relationship
do you think this is?

596
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:42,871
What?

597
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,543
What do you think would've happened to us

598
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:49,962
if I didn't work at Jangga Co.?

599
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:57,010
Whether or not you work there,

600
00:37:58,011 --> 00:38:00,931
you're the one who gets to decide
what our relationship is.

601
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:06,979
You always make me the responsible one.

602
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:08,730
But you never once confessed how you feel.

603
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:12,276
I like you.

604
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,450
I told you that when I was in prison.

605
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:25,372
That was ten years ago.

606
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:27,249
And the bus stop?

607
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,294
That was pretty recent.

608
00:38:31,753 --> 00:38:33,088
Are you kidding me?

609
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:36,508
You told me you're going to make me quit.

610
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:37,718
You call that a confession?

611
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:42,931
What more do I need to say
to get my point across?

612
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:47,227
My gosh.

613
00:38:49,313 --> 00:38:51,106
I bet my life on it when I told you that.

614
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:56,903
Don't feel pressured,
but just keep that in mind.

615
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,239
You can define our relationship

616
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,659
whenever you want.

617
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:06,872
<i>Because that's who Saeroyi is.</i>

618
00:39:08,332 --> 00:39:09,374
He won't change.

619
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,672
I once said that myself.

620
00:39:16,715 --> 00:39:17,549
What?

621
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:27,142
You're the biggest fool on earth.

622
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,021
Remember what I told you?

623
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:33,482
I like rich people.

624
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:41,239
I own a building.

625
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:49,915
That's not easy, you know.

626
00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:55,170
My gosh.

627
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:06,890
My gosh, you startled me.

628
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:07,974
What?

629
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:09,643
What do you want?

630
00:40:09,726 --> 00:40:11,853
I heard you left last night
with that girl.

631
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:13,647
-Soo-ah?
-Yes.

632
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:16,191
-Yes.
-What did you guys do?

633
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:19,361
-We drank.
-Did something happen?

634
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,739
-Like what?
-Are you guys dating?

635
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,869
Stop talking nonsense
and just get ready for business.

636
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:30,122
I'm not talking nonsense.

637
00:40:32,457 --> 00:40:34,084
Don't go out with her.

638
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:36,670
What?

639
00:40:37,546 --> 00:40:38,839
Why do you care?

640
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:40,006
I just do.

641
00:40:41,174 --> 00:40:42,426
If you go out with her,

642
00:40:44,678 --> 00:40:46,221
I'm going to quit.

643
00:40:47,556 --> 00:40:49,891
What are you talking about?

644
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:52,436
Why do you hate her so much?

645
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,603
Do you really not know?

646
00:40:54,563 --> 00:40:56,732
Do you really not know why?

647
00:40:57,733 --> 00:40:58,817
No, I don't.

648
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:03,238
Just keep it in mind.

649
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:11,580
What's wrong with her?

650
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:25,260
One, two three, four, and five.

651
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:26,678
That's ten...

652
00:41:26,762 --> 00:41:28,180
Let's see.

653
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:29,222
It's the right amount.

654
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:31,391
Thank you.

655
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:33,477
Next month,
I'll make sure I pay you on time.

656
00:41:36,354 --> 00:41:37,689
What's going on?

657
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:39,483
You have customers.

658
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,318
Of course.

659
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:43,361
The young man who runs DanBam

660
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:46,239
helped us with our marketing strategy
and a bunch of other stuff.

661
00:41:46,323 --> 00:41:48,241
-That chestnut?
-Yes.

662
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:50,702
He also helped us fix our menu
and table arrangement.

663
00:41:50,786 --> 00:41:52,245
It's not just us.

664
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:56,166
He's been helping
a lot of people these days.

665
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:02,798
The restaurant seems to be
doing better than before.

666
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:05,884
That young man is very polite,
and he knows a lot of things.

667
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:07,385
He's very admirable.

668
00:42:09,554 --> 00:42:10,972
How interesting.

669
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,392
He reminds me of someone.

670
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,189
<i>Welcome, Mr. Oh.</i>

671
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:25,237
I came across a dish
that was made with your ingredients.

672
00:42:26,071 --> 00:42:28,448
The ingredients were
high in quality and fresh.

673
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:31,201
It made me want to buy from you as well.

674
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:33,537
Thank you for the compliment.

675
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:38,542
You signed an exclusive distribution deal
with a pub in Itaewon

676
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:41,753
named DanBam, right?

677
00:42:41,837 --> 00:42:43,755
Yes, that's right.

678
00:42:46,383 --> 00:42:47,759
How would you like

679
00:42:48,468 --> 00:42:50,720
to sign a deal with us?

680
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:59,771
I'm very grateful to receive
a business offer

681
00:42:59,855 --> 00:43:02,691
from the number one food company in Korea.

682
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:06,027
But is there going to be a condition?

683
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:08,488
A condition?

684
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:14,828
I like that you're straightforward.

685
00:43:15,412 --> 00:43:18,874
As you already know,
our company is very large in size.

686
00:43:19,457 --> 00:43:22,752
If you sign a deal with us, you'll be
too busy to work with anyone else.

687
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:27,716
How about break all the other deals
you've made

688
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:31,761
and sign an exclusive contract
with Jangga Co.?

689
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,932
You mean to break my contract with DanBam?

690
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:38,977
Yes, that's what you'll have to do.

691
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:41,396
But I assure you
that it won't be a bad deal.

692
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,083
Are you heading to Itaewon?

693
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,628
I'm on my way there as well.

694
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,630
Do you want a ride?

695
00:44:06,713 --> 00:44:08,381
Why are you going to Itaewon?

696
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:10,800
Jo Yi-seo, was it?

697
00:44:10,884 --> 00:44:13,303
The manager at DanBam.

698
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:14,971
I'm going to talk to her.

699
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:17,641
Anyway, get in.
It's on the way, so I'll drop you off.

700
00:44:19,392 --> 00:44:20,977
Didn't you get my message?

701
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:24,648
I clearly told you that I don't like you.

702
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:30,320
My gosh.

703
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:41,831
Do you know what my dream is?

704
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:46,711
It's to have you sit
on the passenger seat of my car.

705
00:44:47,462 --> 00:44:49,047
Isn't it such a simple dream?

706
00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:54,469
Where does your confidence come from?

707
00:44:55,303 --> 00:44:56,680
The fact that you're the heir?

708
00:44:56,763 --> 00:44:58,139
Or is it because you're rich?

709
00:44:58,223 --> 00:45:01,476
Am I supposed to thank you
for your attention?

710
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:04,479
I never...

711
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:09,150
I never treated you like that.

712
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:10,527
I clearly told you

713
00:45:11,152 --> 00:45:12,821
why I don't like you.

714
00:45:14,948 --> 00:45:16,074
Yes, you did.

715
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:18,243
Because of the accident.

716
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:21,162
But it was literally an accident.

717
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:23,707
Do you think I hit him with my car
on purpose?

718
00:45:24,332 --> 00:45:26,668
It's true that I hate Saeroyi,
but I would never--

719
00:45:26,751 --> 00:45:27,919
Then what about after that?

720
00:45:31,756 --> 00:45:33,508
What about after the accident?

721
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,639
You didn't call an ambulance.

722
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:42,517
And you let someone else take the blame.

723
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:45,353
Was that all an accident as well?

724
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:50,859
You have no idea

725
00:45:53,528 --> 00:45:55,864
how much I hate you.

726
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,868
Soo-ah.

727
00:46:01,536 --> 00:46:02,537
Oh, right.

728
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:09,127
Remember when you asked me
if I like Saeroyi?

729
00:46:10,962 --> 00:46:11,838
What?

730
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:14,340
I like him.

731
00:46:16,593 --> 00:46:18,428
So let me tell you once again.

732
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:20,555
Please do me a favor

733
00:46:22,432 --> 00:46:24,059
and stop hitting on me.

734
00:46:27,395 --> 00:46:30,774
Well then, Mr. Jang. I'll be off now.

735
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:42,660
Fuck!

736
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:46,873
PRODUCT SUPPLY AGREEMENT

737
00:46:52,837 --> 00:46:54,631
This is a contract with good terms.

738
00:46:58,635 --> 00:46:59,636
But

739
00:47:01,096 --> 00:47:02,597
I'm afraid I have to turn it down.

740
00:47:06,768 --> 00:47:08,812
Oh, gosh.

741
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:14,150
I heard you have a connection
with Saeroyi.

742
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,154
Are you being like this because of him?

743
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:21,950
Yes. I owe him something.

744
00:47:22,033 --> 00:47:23,368
How much is it?

745
00:47:23,451 --> 00:47:25,995
It's not something
I can pay back with money.

746
00:47:27,997 --> 00:47:30,458
Let me give you a piece of advice.

747
00:47:32,168 --> 00:47:35,130
Business isn't something
you should do emotionally.

748
00:47:35,964 --> 00:47:37,507
You just said that yourself.

749
00:47:38,716 --> 00:47:40,927
Jangga is the biggest
restaurant business in Korea.

750
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,387
I think it is for now.

751
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,014
-Then you should take it.
-But in ten years,

752
00:47:46,808 --> 00:47:48,268
how much do you think

753
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:50,728
Saeroyi and DanBam

754
00:47:52,981 --> 00:47:54,691
will be growing?

755
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,778
This isn't about loyalty.

756
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:02,657
It's an investment for the future

757
00:48:02,824 --> 00:48:05,160
to make a profit.

758
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:10,248
You're young.

759
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,877
Do you have children?

760
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,339
Yes. I have a daughter.

761
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:27,515
You sound like a reckless man
who has nothing to lose.

762
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,895
No good can come from going
against me in this industry.

763
00:48:34,105 --> 00:48:35,899
You should think about your child.

764
00:48:39,861 --> 00:48:41,112
You may leave now.

765
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:43,364
Call me if you change your mind.

766
00:48:51,414 --> 00:48:53,625
I will get going then.

767
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:06,471
<i>Children follow their parents' footsteps.</i>

768
00:49:06,554 --> 00:49:08,223
<i>She kept bragging about you.</i>

769
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:10,558
<i>It sounded like you're a great dad.</i>

770
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:15,563
Think about my child?

771
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:26,950
You know what, Chairman Jang?

772
00:49:29,994 --> 00:49:32,747
Children follow their parents' footsteps.

773
00:49:33,748 --> 00:49:35,124
Looking at you,

774
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:38,461
I can tell why Jang Geun-won
turned out like that.

775
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:43,049
You better not to provoke me.

776
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:47,428
I said I owe Saeroyi something.

777
00:49:48,304 --> 00:49:49,430
The debt

778
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:52,141
has something to do with you too.

779
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:54,310
What?

780
00:49:54,394 --> 00:49:57,272
The hit-and-run accident
of Jang Geun-won from ten years ago.

781
00:49:59,482 --> 00:50:00,692
Unfortunately,

782
00:50:01,276 --> 00:50:03,653
I was the cop in charge of the case.

783
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:08,866
He left the police about ten years ago

784
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:11,202
and started a produce supply business.

785
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:26,259
Is it that you--

786
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:29,887
Back then,
I conducted a shameful investigation.

787
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,683
My daughter will grow up
looking at my pathetic footstep.

788
00:50:35,393 --> 00:50:37,687
One pathetic footstep is enough.

789
00:50:42,066 --> 00:50:43,443
Because of my daughter,

790
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,988
I can't be any more pathetic than this.

791
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,441
Gosh.

792
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:30,198
You look like an old lady sometimes.

793
00:51:31,657 --> 00:51:33,701
I want to be alone.

794
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:36,788
What are you thinking about?

795
00:51:37,914 --> 00:51:41,417
I'm not sure what I'm doing now.

796
00:51:42,794 --> 00:51:44,629
I know how you feel.

797
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,048
But what Saeroyi said.

798
00:51:47,715 --> 00:51:49,634
Don't you think it's all correct?

799
00:51:51,928 --> 00:51:54,430
Did you catch idealism from him?

800
00:51:58,434 --> 00:52:00,311
I didn't do enough research.

801
00:52:00,853 --> 00:52:02,146
I'm sorry, sir.

802
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:05,108
What about Jo Yi-seo?

803
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,527
How long do I have to wait?

804
00:52:07,902 --> 00:52:12,281
Mr. Jang is going to give her
a job offer today.

805
00:52:15,827 --> 00:52:17,036
Geun-won?

806
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,121
Yes.

807
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:24,627
I'm back.

808
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,379
Geun-soo.

809
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:30,258
Hey.

810
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:33,553
You're here right on time.

811
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:36,055
Hi.

812
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:42,353
What are you doing here?

813
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:45,314
I'm not here to see you.

814
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:48,484
You know me, right?

815
00:52:50,903 --> 00:52:52,238
I'm Jang Geun-won.

816
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:54,031
JANGGA CO. JANG GEUN-WON

817
00:52:54,532 --> 00:52:56,576
Can I talk to you for a moment?

818
00:53:00,955 --> 00:53:01,831
Boss.

819
00:53:02,707 --> 00:53:04,459
I'll go talk to him for a bit.

820
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:07,837
Sure.

821
00:53:09,297 --> 00:53:12,049
There's a cafe down the hill.
Let's go there.

822
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:16,387
Look at her. She's so cool.

823
00:53:17,555 --> 00:53:19,307
I like that.

824
00:53:19,932 --> 00:53:20,766
Wait.

825
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,521
Why do you want to talk to Yi-seo?

826
00:53:28,024 --> 00:53:29,525
I guess you've lost your touch.

827
00:53:32,737 --> 00:53:33,988
Whatever it is,

828
00:53:34,864 --> 00:53:36,574
don't mess with Yi-seo.

829
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:40,620
Have you lost your mind?

830
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:45,875
Look at you.

831
00:53:47,168 --> 00:53:48,336
Let go of it.

832
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:52,507
Hey.

833
00:53:53,382 --> 00:53:58,221
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

834
00:53:59,931 --> 00:54:03,226
you should take over Jangga Co.

835
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:13,027
You better not provoke me.

836
00:54:16,906 --> 00:54:18,533
I might

837
00:54:20,243 --> 00:54:21,953
take over your position.

838
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,834
You rascal.

839
00:54:31,712 --> 00:54:32,713
Oh, right.

840
00:54:33,756 --> 00:54:35,925
Was her name Jo Yi-seo?

841
00:54:36,926 --> 00:54:38,678
I'm not messing with her.

842
00:54:39,512 --> 00:54:40,846
I'm here to give her a job offer.

843
00:54:43,182 --> 00:54:45,726
Between this tiny pub and Jangga Co.?

844
00:54:46,352 --> 00:54:47,937
She has no reason to hesitate.

845
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:53,818
Damn it.

846
00:54:53,901 --> 00:54:55,820
What the hell is he talking about?

847
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:57,238
A job offer?

848
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:59,740
Does that mean he will take Yi-seo?

849
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:00,783
Boss.

850
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:02,660
Don't make a fuss.

851
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:05,580
What are you going to do?

852
00:55:06,163 --> 00:55:07,248
It's Yi-seo's life.

853
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,916
It's her decision.

854
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:10,960
We should just wait and see.

855
00:55:21,012 --> 00:55:22,597
MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL

856
00:55:23,556 --> 00:55:26,809
You are just a 20-year-old kid
who didn't even go to college.

857
00:55:26,892 --> 00:55:29,604
You can't get an exceptional offer
like this elsewhere

858
00:55:30,187 --> 00:55:32,148
There's nothing to think about.

859
00:55:32,982 --> 00:55:34,066
When will you join us?

860
00:55:40,906 --> 00:55:42,783
JANGGA CO. JANG GEUN-WON

861
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,622
I'm sure.

862
00:55:47,913 --> 00:55:49,832
If he offers a better salary,

863
00:55:49,915 --> 00:55:51,709
she will definitely go there.

864
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:53,085
I don't know.

865
00:55:53,169 --> 00:55:55,212
If it was about money,
she wouldn't have joined DanBam

866
00:55:55,296 --> 00:55:56,964
in the first place.

867
00:55:57,048 --> 00:56:00,259
Exactly. Koreans are loyal and faithful.

868
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,430
She hasn't even worked here for long.

869
00:56:04,513 --> 00:56:06,807
Loyal and faithful, my foot.

870
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:12,188
<i>I'm going to quit.</i>

871
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:14,940
Are you nervous?

872
00:56:17,693 --> 00:56:19,987
We really aren't a great match.

873
00:56:25,201 --> 00:56:26,118
Yes.

874
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,537
Do you need Yi-seo

875
00:56:29,914 --> 00:56:31,165
because she's competent?

876
00:56:35,878 --> 00:56:37,338
I'm just wondering how you feel.

877
00:56:41,384 --> 00:56:43,719
What Yi-seo means to you.

878
00:56:44,929 --> 00:56:46,639
Is she just an employee?

879
00:56:47,723 --> 00:56:48,808
Or

880
00:56:50,685 --> 00:56:52,103
do you have feelings for her?

881
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:54,230
What is he talking about?

882
00:56:55,231 --> 00:56:56,107
What?

883
00:57:17,002 --> 00:57:18,546
That is quite an offer.

884
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:20,339
Gosh.

885
00:57:21,382 --> 00:57:23,092
It's not just good.

886
00:57:24,385 --> 00:57:26,595
You may be too young to see it.

887
00:57:26,762 --> 00:57:28,055
But this is a great opportunity.

888
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:29,390
Director Jang.

889
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:32,601
I invested some money in the pub,

890
00:57:32,685 --> 00:57:35,146
so I'm making quite a lot for my age.

891
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:39,608
I guess I make more
than the salary you just offered.

892
00:57:39,692 --> 00:57:41,569
It's Jangga Co. we're talking about.

893
00:57:41,652 --> 00:57:44,155
If you can't offer me more money
than a tiny pub like that,

894
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:47,283
I will have to think about it.

895
00:57:50,286 --> 00:57:53,247
I see. How much do you make?

896
00:57:54,331 --> 00:57:57,251
Considering the sales,
I guess I make about 100 million won.

897
00:57:58,127 --> 00:57:59,336
Is it 100 million won?

898
00:58:00,004 --> 00:58:02,173
It's just based on current sales.

899
00:58:03,174 --> 00:58:05,718
I'm confident I can make DanBam bigger.

900
00:58:07,178 --> 00:58:09,054
I might be tempted

901
00:58:09,138 --> 00:58:10,848
-if you offer 200 million won.
-200 million?

902
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,976
Oh, right. I guess

903
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:18,814
it's not something you can decide.

904
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:21,233
Is it 200 million won?

905
00:58:25,654 --> 00:58:27,031
Let's add 50 million won.

906
00:58:28,324 --> 00:58:29,825
I'll make it 250 million won.

907
00:58:32,828 --> 00:58:34,330
What? 250 million...

908
00:58:35,164 --> 00:58:38,000
Jangga Co. is unbelievable.

909
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:42,296
Saeroyi's pub will go down after all.

910
00:58:42,546 --> 00:58:43,506
Hey.

911
00:58:44,507 --> 00:58:48,260
Your life's path may change
according to the connection you choose.

912
00:58:48,344 --> 00:58:49,720
There's no reason to hesitate.

913
00:58:49,804 --> 00:58:53,891
Actually I was fed up with Saeroyi
being so stubborn and inflexible.

914
00:58:54,391 --> 00:58:57,812
Without my shares in the pub,
I would've quit already.

915
00:58:57,895 --> 00:58:59,605
Now we are talking.

916
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:01,065
He's just an immature kid.

917
00:59:01,148 --> 00:59:02,566
I know.

918
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:06,237
He just tries to mess with Chairman Jang
and you forgetting himself.

919
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:09,490
You must have your authority.

920
00:59:10,866 --> 00:59:14,411
You're planning to smash DanBam, right?

921
00:59:15,412 --> 00:59:18,249
You're quite quick-witted.

922
00:59:18,624 --> 00:59:20,084
You're worth the money.

923
00:59:20,543 --> 00:59:21,418
Thank you.

924
00:59:21,502 --> 00:59:24,296
Let me save your number.

925
00:59:28,384 --> 00:59:30,386
So when should I start working?

926
00:59:30,469 --> 00:59:33,013
You can do it tomorrow or a week later.

927
00:59:33,097 --> 00:59:34,807
Whatever works for you.

928
00:59:39,144 --> 00:59:40,104
Oh, right.

929
00:59:40,604 --> 00:59:42,106
I have a question.

930
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:46,819
About Park Saeroyi.
Why is that punk trying to mess with you?

931
00:59:48,654 --> 00:59:49,655
What?

932
00:59:51,532 --> 00:59:53,075
Something happened before.

933
00:59:54,785 --> 00:59:55,786
What happened?

934
00:59:57,663 --> 00:59:59,707
It's no big deal. You don't have to know.

935
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:03,252
Oh, right.

936
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:06,672
I guess it's because of the thing
you said in front of a police station.

937
01:00:07,548 --> 01:00:09,550
I heard Park Saeroyi's dad

938
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:11,969
died because of you.

939
01:00:20,686 --> 01:00:23,063
If that's true,

940
01:00:25,357 --> 01:00:27,610
you are unbelievable.

941
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:31,780
What?

942
01:00:32,114 --> 01:00:34,909
It means you're above the law.

943
01:00:39,288 --> 01:00:40,873
That's amazing.

944
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:44,418
Oh, well...

945
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:48,672
Gosh, I'm sorry.

946
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:52,301
I can't really discern right from wrong.

947
01:00:53,886 --> 01:00:55,721
Did I offend you?

948
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:01,977
No. That's just how people live.

949
01:01:02,478 --> 01:01:06,565
The law is
all about disciplining the poor.

950
01:01:06,649 --> 01:01:09,610
The law doesn't apply to those who rule.

951
01:01:10,903 --> 01:01:14,448
So? Would you please
tell me about it in detail?

952
01:01:17,242 --> 01:01:19,912
It's nothing. It was an accident.

953
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,123
I hit his dad with a car,

954
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,709
and he died instantly.

955
01:01:26,877 --> 01:01:28,921
But someone else ended up in jail.
End of the story.

956
01:01:31,924 --> 01:01:35,803
I wonder how Saeroyi found it out though.

957
01:01:35,886 --> 01:01:39,556
I guess he hasn't learned his lesson.
He's still trying to get back at me.

958
01:01:40,391 --> 01:01:43,894
But what can livestock do?
Don't you think so?

959
01:01:44,103 --> 01:01:45,104
There's nothing.

960
01:01:47,356 --> 01:01:48,482
What can he do?

961
01:01:52,695 --> 01:01:55,322
<i>What is this scar?</i>

962
01:01:55,406 --> 01:01:59,785
I got hurt when I worked
on the deep-sea fishing vessel.

963
01:02:02,621 --> 01:02:04,039
And what about this one?

964
01:02:04,957 --> 01:02:06,333
When I did manual labor.

965
01:02:14,633 --> 01:02:17,469
You must've had a hard time all alone.

966
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:26,311
<i>I decided to kill</i>

967
01:02:26,854 --> 01:02:29,148
<i>those who mess with this guy.</i>

968
01:02:31,233 --> 01:02:32,443
This is so sweet.

969
01:02:38,782 --> 01:02:40,034
Enough.

970
01:02:44,705 --> 01:02:46,206
I want you to stop now.

971
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,459
What?

972
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:50,419
Stop what?

973
01:02:55,174 --> 01:02:56,467
RECORDING

974
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:58,177
Let me see.

975
01:02:59,636 --> 01:03:01,138
Was it around here?

976
01:03:05,225 --> 01:03:09,438
<i>The law is
all about disciplining the poor.</i>

977
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:12,524
<i>The law doesn't apply to those who rule.</i>

978
01:03:12,983 --> 01:03:16,612
<i>So? Would you please
tell me about it in detail?</i>

979
01:03:17,321 --> 01:03:18,489
<i>It's nothing.</i>

980
01:03:18,697 --> 01:03:19,948
<i>It was an accident.</i>

981
01:03:21,116 --> 01:03:23,368
<i>I hit his dad with a car,</i>

982
01:03:24,536 --> 01:03:25,704
<i>and he died instantly.</i>

983
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:29,124
<i>But someone else ended up in jail.
End of the story.</i>

984
01:03:32,169 --> 01:03:33,962
What are you doing?

985
01:03:36,256 --> 01:03:38,133
I've never seen

986
01:03:38,717 --> 01:03:41,345
a dumbhead like you my whole life.

987
01:03:41,428 --> 01:03:42,846
Damn it.

988
01:03:51,188 --> 01:03:52,272
I...

989
01:03:53,398 --> 01:03:56,068
love my boss like crazy.

990
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,738
But the problem is

991
01:04:00,864 --> 01:04:06,787
that his head is full of the bastards
from that damn Jangga Co.

992
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:12,417
I'm so jealous.

993
01:04:18,006 --> 01:04:20,968
You damn sons of bitches.

994
01:04:34,189 --> 01:04:35,357
So

995
01:04:37,067 --> 01:04:39,653
I'm going to crush you all.

996
01:04:51,498 --> 01:04:53,876
SPECIAL THANKS TO HONG SEOK-CHEON

Subtitle translation by Liya Choi

998
01:05:10,893 --> 01:05:11,977
<i>Your dad is my enemy.</i>

999
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,353
To make him pay for his sins...

1000
01:05:13,437 --> 01:05:15,189
And in order to do that, I'll do anything.

1001
01:05:15,272 --> 01:05:17,024
<i>I'm Jo Yi-seo, the manager of DanBam.</i>

1002
01:05:17,107 --> 01:05:18,233
This is important.

1003
01:05:18,317 --> 01:05:19,860
I'm afraid we should give up.

1004
01:05:19,943 --> 01:05:22,863
That's ridiculous. This fight will be ours
to win. So why would we give up?

1005
01:05:22,946 --> 01:05:24,198
You can prove his innocence?

1006
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:25,490
I think we have a chance here.

1007
01:05:25,574 --> 01:05:27,868
<i>But I think
you need to have your son dismissed.</i>

1008
01:05:27,951 --> 01:05:31,705
Don't you dare tell me
to abandon my family ever again.

1009
01:05:31,788 --> 01:05:33,874
Now is the right time
to dismiss the chairman.

1010
01:05:33,957 --> 01:05:35,876
A proposal to dismiss the chairman?
Are you crazy?

1011
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:37,544
<i>I will make you regret this.</i>

1012
01:05:38,128 --> 01:05:39,880
<i>I will offer my life</i>

1013
01:05:39,963 --> 01:05:41,715
to make the same promise.

1014
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:43,884
<i>It's still...</i>

1015
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,136
<i>bitter.</i>
