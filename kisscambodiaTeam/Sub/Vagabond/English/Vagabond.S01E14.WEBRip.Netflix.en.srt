1
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,383
Listen.

2
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,595
You know how it works.
You used to sit where I am.

3
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,765
I won't bother asking.
Write down everything you know.

4
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,351
About what?

5
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,646
Everything you know
about Director An and Secretary Yun.

6
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,897
Listen,

7
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,191
you know what we do here.

8
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,653
We work for the sake of our nation.

9
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,405
I've been told it was for our nation,

10
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,074
so I just followed the orders.

11
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,743
Fabricating evidence,
twisting the truth,

12
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,037
and killing the innocent.

13
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,289
Is it all for our nation's sake?

14
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,374
Are you a moron?

15
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,669
You have also followed orders
to kill people.

16
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,214
My opinion doesn't matter
when following orders.

17
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,465
That's our definition

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,468
of patriotism and fate.

19
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,972
I heard you asked Yun Han-gi
for the Director General position?

20
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,352
-Who told you that?
-"Patriotism and fate"?

21
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,354
My ass, you bastard.

22
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,065
You're just a fucking swindler.

23
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,818
A fucking scumbag who sold out

24
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,820
his company and colleagues.

25
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,364
I didn't ask for that position!

26
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,366
-Yun Han-gi--
-I told you!

27
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,829
Don't tell me.
Fucking write everything down there!

28
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,225
Who told you about the position offer?

29
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,977
Nobody.

30
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,439
You just sounded him out?

31
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,941
Everyone knows it's what he wants.

32
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,610
It was an easy move.

33
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,415
Go Hae-ri is here.

34
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,878
Wow!

35
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,432
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

36
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,309
Hi, welcome back.

37
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,228
Go Hae-ri.

38
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,022
Thank you, sir.

39
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,150
Good job.

40
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,696
Go check your office.
Everything's ready for you.

41
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,951
Before that,
I need to say hello to some people.

42
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,146
Don't be discouraged.

43
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,690
Cheer up!

44
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,279
Elsa.

45
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,578
What would we have done without you?

46
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,729
MEMORIAL TOWER

47
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,532
The hardest order to follow is

48
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,160
to come back alive.

49
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,707
You completed the most important mission.

50
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,462
They'd be proud of you.

51
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,311
Oh, what can we do for Dal-geon?

52
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,189
We should get him a wife.
He's hit the age.

53
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,107
You're not a virgin, are you?

54
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,151
That was completely unnecessary.

55
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,861
Look at him blushing!

56
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,279
-You are, aren't you?
-Huh?

57
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,530
He's really red.

58
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,907
-Stop it!
-I'm so sorry!

59
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,451
-Where are you going?
-To the toilet.

60
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,998
Jeez.

61
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,508
Me, too! Hey, me too!

62
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,135
-One at a time.
-Sit, stay seated! Hey!

63
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,097
-Hi. Nice to meet you guys.
-Hi.

64
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,348
We're sitting down again now.

65
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,183
Sit here, you!

66
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,103
-Hey, you punk!
-Do that later. Sit.

67
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,395
Hey, you punk!

68
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,037
Hello?

69
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,125
Who is this?

70
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,546
Who are you?

71
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,675
Turn around.

72
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,851
Stay where you are.

73
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,769
What's this clip about?

74
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,938
It's from Jessica.

75
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,481
Jessica?

76
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,526
Min Jae-sik secretly took it from the NIS.

77
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,362
Why did she send it to me?

78
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,781
She wants you to visit her.

79
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,034
You can ask her that question in person.

80
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,121
I'm done being a messenger.

81
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,291
The ball is in your court, now.

82
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,306
Hae-ri Go, where are you?

83
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,640
At the office.

84
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,642
I told you it was my first day back.

85
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,728
We need to meet now. I'll come over.

86
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,396
Is everything okay?

87
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,732
I'll tell you in person.

88
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,219
What are you doing?

89
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,345
What do you mean?

90
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,641
After talking to Dal-geon,
you're acting weird.

91
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,727
This happened to be in my purse,
so I'm just trying it on.

92
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,687
And it's not a crime wearing make-up.

93
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,441
Girl, you look very pretty, though.

94
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,695
What if Dal-geon falls
head over heels for you?

95
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,365
Jeez, don't worry.

96
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,325
I'm used to that kind of situation.

97
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,701
Silly girl.

98
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,963
You're wearing make-up.

99
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,509
Perfume, too?
Did you have a special plan?

100
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,970
Not at all.

101
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,597
This is my daily look.

102
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,101
By the way,

103
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,353
where are we going?

104
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,439
Are you taking me out on a date,

105
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,608
or going for a drive, or something?

106
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,279
Check out the most recent clip.

107
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,739
What is it?

108
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,494
Where did you get it?

109
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,748
And it was from Jessica?

110
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,584
Yes, to Cha Dal-geon.

111
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,545
I don't get it.
It'd be used against her in court.

112
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,714
That's why we're on our way to meet her.

113
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,341
Can you see the guy behind Hoon?

114
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,135
-Yeah, zoom in.
-This?

115
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,220
He's called Jerome.

116
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,348
He crashed the plane with Kim Woo-gi.

117
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,309
Please do a background check.

118
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,730
TO ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER
KOREA CORRECTIONAL SERVICE

119
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,161
I don't want to see you
more than necessary,

120
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,371
so let's make this quick.

121
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,791
Why did you send the clip?

122
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,795
I've never ordered the plane crash.

123
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,966
We aren't here
to listen to your ridiculous excuse.

124
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,885
Whether you believe it or not,

125
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,430
what I'm about to tell you is very true.

126
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:43,059
If it weren't you, why did you
make a hell of a mess to kill us?

127
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,981
Because we needed
to get that F-X plan at any cost.

128
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,317
Why did you kill your VP, Michael?

129
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,319
I didn't.

130
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,863
He didn't kill himself, either.

131
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,657
That's why it's odd.

132
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,994
If I neither killed him
nor he killed himself, then...

133
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,581
Are you saying a third party did it?

134
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,669
That's why I have kept the clip till now.

135
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
To find out who killed Michael.

136
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,590
As you can see,

137
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,301
I can't do anything in this situation.

138
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,221
That's why I sent it to you.

139
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,348
You need to find out

140
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,392
who's that terrorist.

141
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,937
Have you ever seen Michael's girlfriend?

142
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,940
She's a photography major,

143
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,859
and I heard she's Japanese.

144
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,903
Japanese?

145
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,988
That's all I know. I've never seen her.

146
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,036
You sound pretty convincing
but you are still guilty.

147
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,666
Did you know
that O Sang-mi has been released?

148
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,460
What?

149
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,089
The court must be out of its mind.

150
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,340
How could this happen?

151
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,803
A series of strange things
are happening right now.

152
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,515
What if

153
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,977
the truth you know

154
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,272
isn't actually true?

155
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,717
There's no trace of O Sang-mi at home.
What shall we do?

156
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,220
Then why did you climb over the wall
when you could've used the gate?

157
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,639
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't hide her away.

158
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,933
Whatever.

159
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,270
Find out where she might be.

160
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,605
You find out.

161
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,024
You asked for a job
because you got nowhere to go.

162
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:55,983
Prove your worth!

163
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,068
You're so hot-tempered.

164
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,490
It'd be faster to find a needle
in a haystack. How am I supposed to--

165
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,159
What's wrong?

166
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,580
My, my.
Aren't they underlings from the NIS?

167
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,793
Those bastards
must've smelled something out.

168
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,007
KIM WOO-GI
O SANG-MI

169
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,258
Don't.

170
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:22,927
Stay down.

171
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,815
BANK

172
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,660
BALANCE: 0 WON

173
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,178
You people think

174
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,056
I can be pushed around
because I'm a woman?

175
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,935
Let me make it clear.
Transfer the money now.

176
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,187
What?

177
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,730
Three days?

178
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,734
Why? Do you think
you can find me in three days?

179
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,821
In your dreams!

180
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:30,494
I will give you three days, but...

181
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,206
unless I have 20 billion won till then,

182
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,544
I'll fucking expose everything you did.

183
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,214
Remember.

184
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,091
It's three days.

185
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,895
O Sang-mi has disappeared?

186
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,188
We're asking around her acquaintances,

187
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,565
but it's not easy.

188
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,859
Then Jessica might be telling the truth.

189
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,819
John &amp; Mark was found responsible,

190
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,487
but things don't add up.

191
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,533
Let's look into these three points.
First, who pulled strings to release O.

192
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,452
Second, who Michael's girlfriend is.

193
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,954
Last, whom Jerome works for.

194
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,707
Let's unravel one by one.

195
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,918
We're going to meet Kim Woo-gi first.

196
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,628
Which prison is he in?

197
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,921
He's not in prison.

198
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,925
-Then where?
-In a mental hospital for drug addiction.

199
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,927
Where is that place?

200
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,721
No. 114 is missing.

201
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,599
No. 114 is missing.

202
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,810
No. 114 is missing.

203
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,146
-Find him now!
-Fuck!

204
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,609
Find him!

205
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,986
Where is he?

206
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,322
If we lose him, we're dead.

207
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,164
Let me go!

208
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,250
Get the fuck off me! No, no!

209
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,837
No! Get off me!

210
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,797
No!

211
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,008
-No!
-Hold him tight.

212
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,552
Tighter!

213
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,597
No, no!

214
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,568
HAEDONG PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

215
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,960
I got a call.
You are from the NIS?

216
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,880
Correct. Can we meet
Kim Woo-gi for our investigation?

217
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:51,218
Well, actually, he had to be sedated
because he had a fit.

218
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,430
It'll take a while for him to wake up.

219
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,850
We'll wait.

220
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,102
No problem.

221
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,400
I feel intimidated.
Maybe because it's a mental hospital?

222
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,287
What shall I do?

223
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,249
Give Kim a stimulant to wake him up.

224
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,250
Yes, sir.

225
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,806
Kim Woo-gi, wake up!

226
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,237
Cha Dal-geon is here.

227
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,241
If you tell him anything,

228
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,869
consider yourself dead.

229
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,875
His condition seems worse than before.

230
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,628
Do you give him morphine?

231
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,839
We don't use any drugs here.

232
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,133
You can talk to him now.

233
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,343
You don't need to be here.

234
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,429
It can be dangerous
since he's very delusional.

235
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,682
Don't worry. We can handle it.

236
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,518
Okay, then.

237
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,903
I have a few questions.

238
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,115
Can you answer me?

239
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,328
You knew
O Sang-mi would be released, didn't you?

240
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,501
Are you sure
the one who had Michael killed is Jessica?

241
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,424
You said his girlfriend
introduced you to him, right?

242
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,343
That's what you said.

243
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,566
If it wasn't Jessica who killed Michael,

244
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,568
it could be his girlfriend.

245
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,156
Tell us what you know.

246
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,702
If it was she who killed him,
you'd know why.

247
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,580
I know nothing!

248
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,208
I know nothing! Nothing!

249
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,752
Nothing!

250
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,713
Nothing!

251
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,007
Nothing!

252
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,426
-Okay, I understand.
-I don't know.

253
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,765
Then tell us anything

254
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,267
about Jerome.

255
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,779
Back in Morocco,
you said he approached you on purpose.

256
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,614
You clearly said
he got you to start taking drugs.

257
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,787
That asshole tried to kill you
right after the crash,

258
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,247
so, you had to run--

259
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,086
Hey, calm down! Kim Woo-gi!

260
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,673
What are you doing?
This is a mental hospital.

261
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,216
You mustn't provoke him!

262
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,385
-We didn't!
-You should leave.

263
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,720
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,222
Let's go, Dal-geon.

265
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,184
Help me.

266
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,563
They are going to kill me.

267
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,523
Here we go, again.

268
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,734
-Let's move him for treatment.
-Yes, sir.

269
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,444
Please move aside.

270
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,487
-Get up.
-Gosh.

271
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,615
Let's go.

272
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,867
Jerome is here!

273
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,201
What?

274
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,413
The fucker is here, you moron!

275
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,874
-Take him now!
-Yes, sir. Get out!

276
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,043
Jerome will approach you soon!

277
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,754
Get the fuck off me! Get off me!

278
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,716
When he has a fit,
he talks all kinds of gibberish.

279
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,224
You walked a lot today. How are your legs?

280
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,227
They feel a little stiff, but it's okay.

281
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,899
He wasn't that bad when he was with us.

282
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,903
You don't say.
He's supposed to be better with treatment.

283
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,032
Mental hospitals these days are
well maintained.

284
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,659
Why is he locked up
in a place like this?

285
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,391
Samael has given you a last chance.

286
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,069
His Korean name is Park Su-chan.

287
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,447
He was left at an orphanage
upon his birth.

288
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,491
He was adopted to France when he was five

289
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,744
but he was disowned when he was 12.

290
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,372
He was in jail
for assault, drug, and burglary

291
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,998
and released at age 22.

292
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:37,999
After that,

293
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,043
there's no record of him.

294
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,922
Is that all we got on Jerome?

295
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,299
Yes. I think...

296
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,052
we need to operate Vagabond.

297
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,514
Oh yes. I don't know
if he sells dogs or chicken,

298
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,016
but we can ask
that man in the chicken place.

299
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,768
He's such a good hacker.

300
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,521
Who is the judge
that approved O Sang-mi's release?

301
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,857
It's Chief Judge An Seung-tae.

302
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,569
I don't think he acted alone.

303
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,656
Find out the high-profile politicians
he associates with.

304
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,453
KEEP QUIET
NO VISITORS

305
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,165
2105
YUN HAN-GI

306
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,929
Every Korean mother
has the same look on her face.

307
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:42,397
It's like she's been withered
by devoting her life to her children.

308
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,027
Anyway, it's a face of love and sorrow.

309
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:53,158
You were also raised
by a single mother in the countryside?

310
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,828
The ones with a poor and lonely childhood

311
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,540
usually turn brutal
when they start to have desires.

312
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,127
The same goes for the President.

313
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,047
“Korea, a powerful and rich nation”?

314
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,927
That's only a masquerade.

315
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,056
It's all about his sheer self-interest.

316
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,185
Nothing more, nothing less.
You know that, don't you?

317
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,944
What are you trying to say?

318
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,113
There's nothing in your tablet PC.

319
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,202
Where did you hide
the secrets about the President?

320
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,954
Why are you

321
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,873
interested in them, sir?

322
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,209
To get rid of the masquerade,

323
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,962
to weed out the self-interests,

324
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,674
and finally to make Korea
a truly powerful nation.

325
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,846
Someone put
charcoal briquette in my car.

326
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,809
Was that you?

327
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,084
What's important now is

328
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,046
that you're still alive.

329
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,757
The one who took me to the hospital

330
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,051
was you, too?

331
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,846
Because you couldn't find

332
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,682
what you wanted in my tablet PC?

333
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,809
I don't need any other evidence,

334
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,021
but the 500 million dollars
from John &amp; Mark.

335
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,523
All I need is
to reveal the account in Singapore.

336
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,235
Then the chaff like Jeong Gook-pyo
will be blown away,

337
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,072
and a new history of Korea will begin.

338
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,078
Don't you still grasp what I'm saying?

339
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,622
I'm giving you

340
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,627
a new opportunity
to be the hero of a new history.

341
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,548
Who

342
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,301
are you really?

343
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,680
For now, there won't be
a further investigation on you.

344
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,309
Call me when you're done thinking.

345
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,770
Who are you really?

346
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,324
A patriot.

347
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,162
A real patriot

348
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,873
unlike Jeong Gook-pyo.

349
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,356
Who is it?

350
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,733
I don't know.

351
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,779
Hello?

352
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,989
Is this Cha Dal-geon?

353
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,533
Yes, who is it?

354
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,577
It's been a while.
I'm Prime Minister Hong Sun-jo.

355
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:32,252
I'd like you to come
to Hotel Hyperion by four o'clock.

356
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,378
What's this about?

357
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:37,132
It's an important matter.
I'd really like you to come.

358
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,343
Okay, see you then.

359
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,928
Excuse--

360
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,474
I don't see why he wants to see me.

361
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,851
Me neither.

362
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,354
He's known
to be a yes man to the President.

363
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,155
Yes, you should listen to it.

364
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,117
Oh, Dal-geon!

365
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,536
Yes.

366
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,747
-Hi.
-Hey.

367
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,498
You guys are all here.

368
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,250
Did the Prime Minster call you, too?

369
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,710
Yes.

370
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,509
Looks like there'll be a press conference.

371
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,512
"A Press conference"?

372
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,056
Is Hong holding a press conference?

373
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,517
Yes, and it's going to start soon.

374
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,353
He didn't mention anything about it.

375
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,064
It's so out of the blue.

376
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,442
It's the President.

377
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,452
The person you're trying to reach...

378
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,995
What the hell is this?

379
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,415
Did he just fucking ignore my call?

380
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,709
What's going on?

381
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,669
What's this about?

382
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:22,570
I know you are busy,
so let me cut to the chase.

383
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,448
I want you to listen
to this recording first.

384
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,790
Soon, they might come to arrest you.

385
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,501
What are you talking about?
No one can arrest me!

386
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,878
If Secretary Yun or Minister Park

387
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,922
mentions your name--

388
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,715
They will never do that!

389
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,094
How much did Jeong Gook-pyo take from us?
No less than 500 million dollars.

390
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,929
Over 500 billion won!

391
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,515
Do you think they'll talk
when that would destroy the Blue House?

392
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,475
No way.

393
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,228
The President won't let them.

394
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,734
Then, are you proceeding with the deal?

395
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,611
The head office is acting strange.

396
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,949
I have to make this deal work
if I want to survive.

397
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,993
-The President is bribed?
-What are they saying?

398
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,828
I don't understand...

399
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,330
I don't know.

400
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,374
The woman in the recording is

401
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,917
Jessica Lee,

402
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,296
the director of John &amp; Mark Asia.

403
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,924
-It's that woman.
-Wait a minute.

404
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,595
Do you have any other evidence
other than this recording?

405
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,930
Yes, I've recently discovered

406
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,933
that John &amp; Mark
invested 500 million dollars

407
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,478
in the trading company
called Deep Blue in Singapore.

408
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,650
And the money was transferred
to a secret account in an Arabian bank.

409
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,861
So, the trading company Deep blue is--

410
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,907
Yes, it's a shell company
and it belongs to

411
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,534
President Jeong Gook-pyo for sure.

412
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,703
What?

413
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,663
I'm Song Yu-seop from JB News.

414
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,086
What the hell is he saying?

415
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,797
I'll call you one by one.
Okay, the second row.

416
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,133
Any proof that its owner
is the President?

417
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,761
I believe Senior Secretary Yun has it.

418
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,642
The President tried to dump
all the responsibility to Yun.

419
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,145
He sort of used him as a human shield.

420
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,189
I assume

421
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,275
that's why Yun took the extreme measure.

422
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,488
How are you going to prove your claim
when Yun is in a coma?

423
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,742
I'm earnestly praying he will wake up.

424
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,913
And also, I'd like to make a promise
to my fellow Koreans

425
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,667
that I will never give up.

426
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:45,129
There was an irregularity
behind the B357 crash,

427
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:51,135
and its mastermind is not Secretary Yun,
but President Jeong Gook-pyo.

428
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,346
And I will prove my claim at any cost.

429
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,557
Motherfucking bastard!

430
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,852
Mr. President, are you alright?

431
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,563
I'll call the doctor.

432
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,482
No. Just water.

433
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:06,985
Give me a glass of water.

434
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,736
Yes, Ms. Chu.

435
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,282
You're very close to the President,
calling each other brother.

436
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,119
What is your reason
to drop a bombshell like this?

437
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,247
The bereaved families.

438
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,126
I'm sorry, but would you mind standing up?

439
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,177
While trying to bring
Kim Woo-gi back here,

440
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,846
Mr. Cha

441
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,891
must've had urges
to take his revenge several times

442
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,102
and maybe to kill him.

443
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,647
I believe the other families
felt the same way.

444
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,318
However, they risked their lives

445
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,113
to save Kim.

446
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,157
Why?

447
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,701
Where did that courage come from?

448
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,369
It's because

449
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,457
they believed in Korea.

450
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,792
In fact, it's because

451
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,171
they couldn't give up on that belief.

452
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,008
Now the nation and the law,

453
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,469
the government and the judicial branch

454
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,848
must respond to their beliefs.

455
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,662
As a governmental official,

456
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,415
I am deeply sorry.

457
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,252
It's our fault. Please forgive us.

458
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:53,716
And thank you so much
for believing in Korea.

459
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,262
We'll do better now.

460
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,599
I'm sorry.

461
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,522
I'm sorry.

462
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,732
We'll do better now.

463
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,070
Thank you for trusting Korea.

464
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,410
Thank you.

465
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,457
I'm sorry.

466
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,043
We'll do better now.

467
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,007
You said Yun Han-gi was a vegetable?

468
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,136
The doctors said he would never wake up.

469
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,139
Arrange an emergency meeting
with the chief secretaries.

470
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,432
-Yes, sir.
-Wait.

471
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,475
Before that,

472
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,103
I need to see Yun Han-gi.

473
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,229
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,438
I'll arrange it.

475
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,940
We'll do better now.

476
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,776
Hong Sun-jo,

477
00:35:55,653 --> 00:36:00,950
are you plotting a coup against me?

478
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,287
We'll do better from now on.

479
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,004
It's me, Secretary Ha.
Put me through to the Prime Minister.

480
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,725
I want to be alone with him.
You guys stay here.

481
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,628
My request is simple.

482
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,632
Just have a deep sleep for a decade.

483
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,053
I hope the world will be better by then.

484
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,597
When you wake up,

485
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,851
I'll give you a big gift.

486
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:15,274
In the meantime,
you mustn't ever wake up, Han-gi.

487
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,103
IS HONG'S SHOCKING REVELATION TRUE?
HONG'S COURAGE TO CHALLENGE POWER

488
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,731
Everyone is praising
the Prime Minister today.

489
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,862
You don't seem happy.

490
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,156
I think the Prime Minister

491
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,952
put on a show by using us.

492
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,121
You could be right.

493
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,708
Have a drink, sir.

494
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,879
The judge who released O Sang-mi
is An Seung-tae,

495
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,301
and he's very close to Hong Sun-jo.

496
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,597
Are you saying Hong released O?

497
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,808
We can't rule out the possibility.

498
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,853
Judge An is very political,

499
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,522
and he's good friends with Hong.

500
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,941
I don't get why
they released O Sang-mi.

501
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,526
Shouldn't we be investigating?

502
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,819
We're already on it.

503
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,572
It's covert, so keep quiet.

504
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,950
The press conference today
was also out of the blue.

505
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,579
The President's right-hand man
dropping a bombshell like that?

506
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,290
If the sitting President had to step down,

507
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,792
who'd benefit from it the most?

508
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,629
That'd be the Prime Minister

509
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,759
because he could become
the acting President.

510
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,888
The plane crash occurred
due to an irregularity,

511
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,225
but also because of a political issue.

512
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,362
What about Jerome?
Have you found out something?

513
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,405
TTOBONG'S CHICKEN

514
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,301
Wow!

515
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,803
Is this for real?

516
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:53,224
This crazy man has broken
into the CIA, too!

517
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,481
But what if we can't find him here?

518
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,566
Then we'll hack the MI6 in the UK.

519
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,153
After that, the FSB in Russia,
Mossad in Israel,

520
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,406
the CIRO in Japan,

521
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,034
the DGSE in France,
and the BND in Germany.

522
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:17,164
Can he really break
into all those intelligence services?

523
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,500
Some I can't.

524
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,131
It might take a while,
but he'll succeed eight out of ten times.

525
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,218
If we still can't find Jerome,
there's no way to find him.

526
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,732
What's wrong? Your back hurts?

527
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,235
No, I'm fine.

528
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,154
Told you not to overdo it.

529
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:49,947
Hop on my back.

530
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,951
My gosh. Never mind. I'm fine.

531
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,246
Don't be stubborn.
It's hard to catch a cab here.

532
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,665
I'm really fine.

533
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,126
Oh, come on!

534
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,631
I might be heavy.

535
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,437
Oh, do you remember the reporter,
Jo Bu-yeong?

536
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,523
Why do you mention him?

537
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,612
Mr. Jo! What happened?
Who did this to you?

538
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,821
Mr. Jo?

539
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,246
I thought I was mistaken,

540
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,666
but something doesn't add up.

541
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,252
Wasn't he from Pyeonghwa Daily?

542
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,379
Let's go there tomorrow.

543
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,633
Hello?

544
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,427
You need to rest. I can go by myself.

545
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,388
You're scared
I'll ask for another piggy-back?

546
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,640
No, I'm not.

547
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,684
It's just that you're heavy.

548
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,102
What?

549
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,022
Okay, then.

550
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,690
We'll go together.

551
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,403
This reminds me of my dad.

552
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,241
He used to carry me like this.

553
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,870
Just ask me.

554
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,831
I'll carry you whenever you want.

555
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,805
PYEONGHWA DAILY

556
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,098
Mr. Jo Bu-yeong?

557
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,809
He passed away.

558
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,565
Hasn't the killer been caught yet?

559
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,066
"The killer"?

560
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,527
He died of a car accident.

561
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,737
"A car accident"?

562
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,489
Not a homicide?

563
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,075
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

564
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,412
He died in New Zealand
due to a sudden car acceleration.

565
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,583
His family has sued the car company.

566
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,630
Are they city desk reporters?

567
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,759
-Yes.
-But I can't see Mr. Jo here.

568
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,346
This is him right here.

569
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,057
He's Mr. Jo Bu-yeong?

570
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,644
That's not him.

571
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,688
Yes. that's Mr. Jo.

572
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,773
Are you sure?

573
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,525
Of course. He was my co-worker.

574
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,606
So, you're going back to the US?

575
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,650
Yes, on tonight's flight.

576
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,154
It's not much, but use it on your trip.

577
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,491
It's okay. I just followed orders.

578
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,951
Don't refuse the Prime Minister's gift.

579
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,953
I shouldn't, but...

580
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,789
Thank you.

581
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,250
By the way, I've heard

582
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,878
Samael holds you in high regard.

583
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,964
I heard he'd visit Seoul soon.

584
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,801
Have you met him in person?

585
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,804
No, I haven't had that honor yet.

586
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,933
You did good. Let's keep in touch.

587
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,893
Okay, I'll be in touch.

588
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,448
Why are you lingering?

589
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,450
I want to get a ride with my uncle.

590
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,546
I told you not to call me uncle.

591
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,715
Your father and I are not
blood-related.

592
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,344
I know our family tree's messed up,
but you're still my uncle.

593
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,765
Anyway, you did good, too.

594
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,518
More than good.

595
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,521
Thanks to the video clips
and recordings I gave you,

596
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,232
you'll be the owner of the Blue House.

597
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,486
Yun Han-gi hasn't made up his mind yet.

598
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,613
It's only a matter of time.

599
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,992
He's fallen from senior secretary
to a third wheel.

600
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,997
Anyway, Dynamic hit a jackpot.

601
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,000
They'll have the F-X plan for themselves.

602
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,127
I won't give it to them that easily.

603
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,838
They'll have to pay for it.

604
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,550
Edward is not easy to deal with.

605
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:02,801
A rebate?

606
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,929
He won't even budge an inch.

607
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,558
I'm not Jeong Gook-pyo.

608
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,728
Wait and see how I deal with him.

609
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,738
The President is having a meeting
with reporters.

610
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,865
Is he now?

611
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,330
Did he say 500 million dollars?

612
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,791
How much is that in Korean won?
50 billion won?

613
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,169
It's over 500 billion.

614
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,921
Wow.

615
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,425
I can't believe my ears.

616
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,720
All I have
is an apartment in Hongeun-dong.

617
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:50,724
Its price has risen a bit,
so maybe it's worth 500 million won now.

618
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,519
I mean, how many zeros did he add to that?

619
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,980
You are also well aware

620
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,817
that my creed
is honesty and non-possession.

621
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,530
Why do you think Prime Minister Hong
held that press conference?

622
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:08,033
Isn't the answer kind of obvious?

623
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,827
He might have conspired with forces

624
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,330
who'd love to scratch my reputation.

625
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:18,335
Anyway, there's no other explanation
than that it's about political slander.

626
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,795
I want to know why, too.

627
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,508
Do you know the company called
Deep Blue in Singapore?

628
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:29,263
Isn't that the name of a new whiskey?

629
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:34,142
Yun Han-gi is said to have
a secret account in an Arabian bank.

630
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:38,146
Then Mr. Yun is a bad person,

631
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,400
having an account I know nothing about.

632
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,322
How is your chief editor's health?

633
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,158
He's doing great. I'll tell him you asked.

634
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,582
Prime Minister Hong is here.

635
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,795
You are fired effective immediately.

636
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,547
If you fire me,

637
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,761
the people will think my claims are true.

638
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:55,349
Once the National Assembly votes
for your dismissal,

639
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,351
I'll just follow their result.

640
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,563
Then I can get rid of you
without your filthy blood on my hands.

641
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,816
They will move to impeach you, too.

642
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,860
What? "Impeach me"?

643
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,406
Do you think
you're capable of that?

644
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,034
If the people demand it,

645
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,995
the Constitutional Court
will have to decide.

646
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,333
It's not about my capability at all.

647
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,672
Why are you doing this?

648
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,341
What is your problem with me?

649
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,719
Your incompetence, irresponsibility,

650
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,682
lies, and greed...

651
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,602
I can't let you deceive
the nation any more,

652
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,647
so I've decided to step up.

653
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,981
Fuck, Hong Sun-jo!

654
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,701
Did I do it all by myself?

655
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,620
Whether they're
groundless rumors or fake news,

656
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,290
you told me those bubbles
could be made easily.

657
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:06,545
When the bubbles are gone,
everyone will believe they are true.

658
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,338
That's what you advised me.

659
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,301
And now you're pretending to be righteous?

660
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,512
You're despicable!

661
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,473
Brother.

662
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,602
Do you know what your biggest mistake is?

663
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,606
For playing the President,

664
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,526
you're too old

665
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,195
and too worn out.

666
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,158
Secretary Seo!

667
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,165
Arrange a meeting
with the three party leaders right now.

668
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,462
Yes, sir.

669
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,425
You just committed treason.

670
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,928
How dare you
fight against the Korean President?

671
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,639
Impeachment?

672
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,854
Let's wait and see
who'll fucking die first.

673
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,116
When is he meeting the party leaders?

674
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,910
I'm checking their schedules.

675
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,496
See to it that I meet them before he does.

676
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,663
You got it, sir.

677
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,626
Am I meeting the bereaved tonight?

678
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,753
-You need to leave now.
-Okay, let's go.

679
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,648
Prime Minister Hong has just arrived.

680
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:58,406
I know you've had a lonely fight

681
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,785
because of the government's indifference.

682
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,913
But until this case is thoroughly solved,

683
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,958
I plan to keep in touch with you.

684
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,128
Please feel free to tell me your opinions.

685
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,923
Thank you, sir.

686
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:20,303
There was a reporter
who cast doubts on John &amp; Mark,

687
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,890
but he was murdered right in front of me.

688
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:28,270
I know nothing about that.
What's his name?

689
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,564
He was called Jo Bu-yeong.

690
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,108
But later I found out

691
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,653
he was neither a reporter nor dead.

692
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,283
I don't quite understand what you mean.

693
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:42,951
That's the point.

694
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,328
We now know the real culprit,

695
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,541
but there are things happening
that don't make sense.

696
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,545
You said his name was Jo Bu-yeong, right?

697
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,673
Can you walk my secretary through it?

698
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,508
I'd like to look into it.

699
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,595
Why did you release O?

700
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,600
O Sang-mi was released?

701
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,853
This is news to me, too.

702
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,480
I believe you know Judge An Seung-tae.

703
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,483
He's said to be
a close acquaintance of yours.

704
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,861
He's the one who released her.

705
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,198
Just because we're close,
it doesn't mean--

706
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,200
When Mr. Jeong Gook-pyo is impeached,

707
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,704
you'll be the acting President, right?

708
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,416
If I'm not dismissed by then,

709
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,421
based on constitutional procedures,
yes, I'll have to fill in.

710
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,558
Anyway, you must be hungry.

711
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,894
-Let's order some food.
-Yes, sir.

712
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,366
How do you do?

713
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,785
Who are you?

714
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,746
I'm Edward, President of Dynamic.

715
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,873
I've contacted you a few times

716
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,960
but never been able to reach you,
so here I am.

717
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,212
If you're here for the F-X plan,

718
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,214
you should meet the President.

719
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,050
There are things to discuss,
so if you spare some time--

720
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,678
Talking to me won't do you any good.

721
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,473
I'm telling you
to help you save your time.

722
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,565
Mr. Park.

723
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,110
Oh, Mr. Cha.

724
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,570
What brings you here?

725
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,273
So you're saying O Sang-mi is missing?

726
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,275
The NIS is trying to find her,

727
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,194
but she's disappeared.

728
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,738
And you assume

729
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,949
Prime Minister Hong is behind it all?

730
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,785
Because it's true he released O.

731
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,747
If what you assume is true,

732
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,375
O got something on Hong.

733
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,882
Jessica claimed
that she didn't kill Michael.

734
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,800
Did you meet her?

735
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:50,388
She sent me a video clip
that shows the terrorist's face.

736
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,768
What else did she say?

737
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,229
That the truth we believe

738
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,982
might not be true.

739
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,193
What a nerve!

740
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,655
Don't be fooled
by her vile tongue, Dal-geon.

741
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,957
This is Cha Dal-geon.

742
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,126
This is O Sang-mi.

743
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,338
What's wrong?

744
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:24,964
It's O Sang-mi.

745
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,969
Where are you now?

746
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,515
Can we meet right away?

747
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,975
Actually, we must meet.

748
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,560
What do you want?

749
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:41,815
They are after me.
They're trying to kill me.

750
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,651
Ms. O, calm down.
Tell me where you are.

751
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,069
I'll go there.

752
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,239
I'm at Gojan-dong...

753
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,326
I know where that is.

754
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,412
It's not that far from here. Stay put.

755
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,249
My husband threatened them.

756
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,043
"Threatened"?

757
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,546
It's them who did it.

758
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:08,299
They're trying to kill me
because I have the evidence.

759
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,759
What evidence?

760
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,346
Who are these people?

761
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,609
Hello? Ms. O Sang-mi?

762
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,236
Ms. O Sang-mi?

763
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:31,614
Ms. O Sang-mi?

764
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,411
Please excuse me.

765
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,413
Call me when you meet her.

766
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,664
Sure.

767
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,350
Is this the police station?

768
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,102
I need your help.

769
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,078
Ms. O Sang-mi?

770
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,833
Ms. O Sang-mi!

771
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,753
Ms. O Sang-mi!

772
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,347
Ms. O Sang-mi?

773
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,351
Ms. O Sang-mi?

774
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,728
Ms. O Sang-mi!

775
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,397
Ms. O, where are you?

776
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,857
Ms. O Sang-mi!

777
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,702
Ms. O Sang-mi!

778
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,787
Ms. O Sang-mi!

779
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,042
Ms. O, where are you?

780
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,503
Ms. O Sang-mi!

781
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,089
Can you hear me?

782
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,760
Long time no see, Cha Dal-geon.

783
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,691
You son of a bitch!

784
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,526
