00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,575
SMALL HEART CONCERT
JOHN &amp; MARK MILITARY TECHNOLOGY

2
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,786
Can you give your word for it?

3
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,455
Hey, mister. Didn't you hear me?

4
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:25,668
The man at the repair shop said
that they did something to my car.

5
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,878
Did you see the car?

6
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,963
I nearly got killed!

7
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,715
As for the details,

8
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,010
Dal-geon will come out
and talk to you about it,

9
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,638
so don't go anywhere
and please wait here.

10
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,600
-Okay.
-Get me a picture. Something's up here.

11
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,856
This is chamomile tea.

12
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,776
It calms your body and mind,

13
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,694
so I got it from the Director.

14
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,196
You should drink up.

15
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,408
You need it more than I do.

16
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,828
How much did Dynamic pay you?

17
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,957
What kind of bullshit is that?

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,960
Things change
but some things never change.

19
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,881
Money means power
and the truth is crafted with power.

20
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,885
I'm telling you to stay out of this fight.

21
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,054
So,

22
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,640
for money

23
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,184
and power,

24
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,605
did you kill all those people?

25
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,732
We never did such a thing.

26
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,612
I don't even watch the news
because it makes me cry.

27
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,948
I know you killed Michael,
the vice president.

28
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,162
And Pyeonghwa Daily Reporter
Jo Bu-yeong.

29
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,626
It seems to me now
that you need treatment.

30
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,255
You are not strangled by the pain.

31
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,883
You are holding onto it.

32
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,188
Did you know you have to be smart
to have a conscience?

33
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,777
You people are stupid as hell.

34
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,363
You messed with the wrong guy.

35
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,074
Watch out.

36
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,828
I'll sip every drop of blood out of you.

37
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,163
Mr. Cha.

38
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,542
How can I help you?

39
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,420
I feel so sorry for you.

40
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,301
Bring Hoon...

41
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,263
...back to life.

42
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,195
The car is ready, ma'am.
You can head out the back.

43
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,367
What happened to
Pyeonghwa Daily Reporter Jo?

44
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,411
He had been investigating the case
and crossed the line.

45
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,373
-If we had left him--
-So you took him out without telling me?

46
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,335
Don't you know
we're on the edge of a cliff?

47
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,296
There is no room for trouble,
so don't worry.

48
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,177
-Bring the car to the front.
-You'll be hassled by reporters.

49
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,179
Avoiding them looks more suspicious.

50
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,308
I should act confident.

51
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,315
So you are saying that John &amp; Mark
is behind the B357 crash.

52
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,109
-Is that it?
-Yes.

53
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,403
Are there any grounds for that claim?

54
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,946
There is a video file.

55
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,157
The NIS has the video
that can prove my point!

56
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,828
If he's telling the truth,
this is shocking news!

57
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,455
Then you should check with the NIS
if that is true.

58
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,461
This is not the first time
our company has heard this claim.

59
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,340
But none of those accusations
were found to be true.

60
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,217
Excuse us. Let us through.

61
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,885
Excuse us.

62
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,345
-Just a moment!
-Sorry.

63
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,724
And when Mr. Cha's claim is found false,

64
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,518
please avoid running critical stories.

65
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,896
He lost his family member in the accident.

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,608
I deeply understand how he must feel.

67
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,215
Yes, this is 111 Call Center.

68
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,509
Yes, we've checked
and there is no such video file.

69
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,095
I have no idea
why that man is saying that.

70
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,764
It's not under investigation.

71
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,099
I'm telling you. That's a false report!

72
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,810
I told you to keep Cha's mouth shut.

73
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,855
What the hell were you doing
when he was chittering and chattering

74
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,982
in front of reporters?

75
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,277
But what he said
was not completely made up.

76
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,280
Since it came to this,
we should start investigating--

77
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,157
Did you grow guts in Morocco?

78
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,451
For crying out loud.

79
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,369
CHIEF MIN JAE-SIK

80
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,458
Yes, Director.

81
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,754
Yes, sir. Understood.

82
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,301
Damn it, why should I be the one
dealing with reporters...

83
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,804
This is all because of you, you idiot!

84
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,848
I'm going to send you off
to rebel groups in the Middle East,

85
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,727
so if you don't want to get shot there,
bring me your resignation letter.

86
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,064
Get out.

87
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,690
Get out!

88
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,785
You're one step away from being sacked.

89
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,495
What's your plan?

90
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,872
Once it gets on the news,
the police will be involved.

91
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,458
We have to take the lead.

92
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,502
Where are you going?

93
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,255
I'm going to die an early death
because of you.

94
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,124
Yes.

95
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,504
What brings you here?

96
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,339
Did you see the pictures I sent?

97
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,802
Yeah, sort of.

98
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,389
I think Michael's death
is somehow related to the plane crash.

99
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,641
So?

100
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,853
How long are you going to
let Chief Min push you around?

101
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,355
Just use our help and--

102
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:10,031
The incompetent one,
the loud one, and the toothless one.

103
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,241
-What can we do together?
-Um, Chief?

104
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,578
I can see who the incompetent
and the toothless ones are.

105
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,455
Am I...

106
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,999
You said there was something off
about Michael's suicide.

107
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,501
That and nothing more.

108
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,462
I was just curious
about my friend's death.

109
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,379
Off you go.

110
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,842
If we nail this,
you would get a two-rank promotion.

111
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,885
Promotion?

112
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,763
Let it go.

113
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,641
This isn't a case
a nobody like you can solve.

114
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,394
-Chief!
-Let's just go.

115
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,063
Since when did you become a chicken?

116
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,525
What? A chicken? You rude little--

117
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,777
This is not like you at all.

118
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,487
-I'm so disappointed!
-Come on.

119
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,031
-Don't touch me!
-Have a nice day, sir!

120
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,199
Let me go!

121
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,307
Michael was murdered.

122
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,563
A left-handed person never uses
his right hand when committing suicide.

123
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,649
Look closely into
Michael's schedule in Portugal.

124
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,326
Did you know the President
invited us to the Blue House tomorrow?

125
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,539
-What time?
-But it's not for all of us.

126
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,416
Only a few representatives are going.

127
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,378
I would've recommended you over me
if I knew this would happen.

128
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,796
B357 PLANE CRASH

129
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,131
Any articles?

130
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,384
Not one.

131
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,137
What?
But they were all so worked up back there.

132
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,308
Do you think
that woman got to them already?

133
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,563
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

134
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,652
Is it Cha Dal-geon again?

135
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,155
What can we do by ourselves?

136
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,200
You should just come clean with him.

137
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,038
The person you're trying to reach...

138
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,791
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

139
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,917
SIX MISSED CALLS

140
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,129
You have a friend in Inspection, right?
Was it Se-hun?

141
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,673
Not exactly a friend. Why do you ask?

142
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,091
I'm going to find the video file.

143
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,469
How?

144
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,429
UNEMPLOYED LIL BRO

145
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,018
-What?
-It's trouble, sis.

146
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,104
One of mom's fund members ran off
with the money

147
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,607
and mom has to pay for it
because she's the fund leader.

148
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,318
Why does she always mess up?

149
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,154
I don't know!
She needs five million won right now.

150
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,865
-Do you have any money?
-I don't have any money!

151
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,408
Tell her to sort it out herself!

152
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,752
You have a crappy life, too.

153
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,506
Jeez. Are you okay?

154
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,097
Do you still want me to meet Se-hun?

155
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,936
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

156
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,687
Bottoms up, okay?

157
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,523
What? Again?

158
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,441
Why are you pushing me so hard...

159
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,944
Are you getting me drunk
so you can do stuff to me?

160
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,072
Why? Are you scared?

161
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,907
Scared of you?

162
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,660
You scare me all the time.

163
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,412
Oh god!

164
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,874
Stop jibber-jabbering and just drink up!

165
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,296
Oh, dear me!

166
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,844
Where are you off to?

167
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,304
Running away already?

168
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,682
I'm off to take a leak! You can't stop me!

169
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,227
Why do you even have a bladder
when it's so small?

170
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,897
What did you say? A small bladder?

171
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,608
You messed with my pride, girl.

172
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:19,196
When I come back from the toilet,
you are as good as dead! Okay?

173
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,704
I don't even know why I am doing this.

174
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,875
Thanks.

175
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,593
Wow. This chicken's so good!

176
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,845
-This is a fantastic chicken place!
-Yep, yep.

177
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,901
NIS

178
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,368
Hey, you. Stop.

179
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,330
Who are you?

180
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,797
Go Hae-ri?

181
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,385
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

182
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,388
It's not like this is a night school.

183
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,182
Do I need your permission?

184
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,644
I'm just asking
because you don't need to be here.

185
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,023
I came to write my resignation letter.
Happy now?

186
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,944
For god's sake.
That was just my temper speaking.

187
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,907
Hey, why do you have to be so dim-witted?

188
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,659
Don't you feel the air around here?

189
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,538
There's no point in working hard.

190
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,915
And you will get hurt
if you don't mind your own business.

191
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,253
You get paid for doing nothing.
What's better than that?

192
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,047
It's best to be average.

193
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,343
You'll only get this kind of advice
from me and no one else.

194
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,804
I'll take note, sir.

195
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,764
Yeah, you do that.

196
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,351
I don't hate you.

197
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,770
I feel bad for you.

198
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,897
GO HAE-RI

199
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,860
-What is it?
-I have something to tell you.

200
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,570
Where are you?

201
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,323
-Something urgent?
-Yes.

202
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,116
I need to meet you now.

203
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,162
I'll text you an address.
Let's meet there.

204
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,101
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DELETE THIS
VIDEO RECORDING?

205
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,313
DELETING VIDEO

206
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,583
Hurry up. This place is about to close.

207
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,210
Explain it to me.

208
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,463
The flash drive your team took.

209
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,674
Why is it infected with a virus?

210
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,971
-How do you know that?
-I saw it with my own eyes.

211
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,017
Then why do you need an explanation?

212
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,520
Are you covering this up?

213
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,986
The plane crash killed 211 people.

214
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,195
Director's orders.

215
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,281
We have to follow them.

216
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,950
"Dedicate yourself in silence
for country and people.

217
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,120
That is the duty and pride
of NIS agents."

218
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,791
Those were the words
you told me over and over again.

219
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,170
Why have you changed?

220
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,880
If you're confident enough,

221
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,883
you can expose it yourself.

222
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,302
Don't you think I can do it?

223
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,428
You can't.

224
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,474
You know you can't.

225
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,964
Ugh.

226
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,717
-Oh god.
-Did you drink a lot?

227
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,763
See me? I look wasted, right?

228
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,973
She completely fell for it.

229
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,519
Man, I should have become an actor!

230
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,479
Give this to Assemblyman Lee Sang-bok.

231
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,065
They will be more influential
than the Prosecutors' Office.

232
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,485
Lee's on a work trip to Japan
and won't come back before this weekend.

233
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,237
Mr. Gi.

234
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,780
Do you really need to do this?

235
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,532
You can back out if you want.

236
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,328
Not a nice thing to say to a man
who always carries a resignation letter.

237
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,083
What if Go Hae-ri decides
to leak it first to the media?

238
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,418
She doesn't have the guts or the ability.

239
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,504
Even if she does talk,

240
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,340
we can always deny it.

241
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,803
Hurry up. This place is about to close.

242
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,430
Explain it to me.

243
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,432
The flash drive your team took.

244
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,768
Why is it infected with a virus?

245
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,438
-How do you know that?
-I saw it with my own eyes.

246
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,439
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING

247
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,994
Yeah.

248
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,496
Where are you now?

249
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,420
Are you kidding me?

250
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,297
How can it be gone?

251
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,674
A virus infection.

252
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,886
You don't believe that, do you?

253
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,971
What if I don't?

254
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,101
Don't you remember what happened
after we came back to Korea?

255
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,061
A reporter died in front of me.

256
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,689
-They are trying to kill me.
-I know.

257
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,817
So what?

258
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,362
This means there's a mole inside the NIS
working for John &amp; Mark.

259
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,656
We have to find out who that is!

260
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,242
I don't have that kind of power.

261
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,333
What about O Sang-mi?
Who's investigating her?

262
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,711
There is no investigation.

263
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,422
Oh.

264
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,013
Shit.

265
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,432
You told me

266
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,060
that you serve the citizens.

267
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,855
You told me to trust you
because you are the experts!

268
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,482
Stop it.

269
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,402
Why do I need to be yelled at by you?

270
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,739
-What?
-I've done everything I could.

271
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,368
What am I supposed to do
when my bosses are covering it up?

272
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,122
Just be honest with me.

273
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,917
You were doing this for a promotion,
but now that you can't,

274
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,086
you're stepping out.

275
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,879
Find out the truth.

276
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,173
You get paid with our taxes.

277
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,929
Don't you have a sense of duty
as a civil servant?

278
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,432
My dad...

279
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,104
He died after saving eight lives
in the military.

280
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,942
He became a hero.

281
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,489
But it was so hard
for the rest of the family.

282
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,701
Civil servant?

283
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,744
Sense of duty?

284
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,581
I don't care about any of that shit.

285
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,626
I'm doing this just to get by.

286
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,257
If I get fired,

287
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,759
my family has to live without a roof.

288
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,514
You are not the only one having it hard.

289
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,984
HOONI'S ROOM
PLEASE KNOCK

290
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,499
Hurry up.

291
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,751
This place is about to close.

292
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,169
Explain it to me.

293
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,589
The flash drive your team took.

294
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,468
-Why is it infected with a virus?
-How do you know that?

295
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,427
SHARE
DELETE

296
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,012
I saw it with my own eyes.

297
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,350
Then why do you need an explanation?

298
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,449
...said that this event
could become the starting point.

299
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,075
Next up.

300
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,078
Families of the B357 crash victims
will be visiting the Blue House

301
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,831
to meet President Jeong Gook-pyo,
eleven o'clock this morning.

302
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:03,210
The families,
invited by the President himself,

303
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,879
will talk about their compensation
for the crash

304
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,714
and prevention of future accidents.

305
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,885
the Blue House hopes to console
the families through today's event,

306
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,137
and looks forward to opening communication

307
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,515
between the government and the families.

308
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,113
-Hello...
-It's me.

309
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,365
Why?

310
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,534
I'll tell you in person. Where are you?

311
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,249
No, I'll go to your place.

312
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,584
Hello?

313
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,503
What is she saying?

314
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,839
God, my head...

315
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,477
That was quick.

316
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,645
Wait up.

317
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,903
-Who is it?
-I just moved in next door.

318
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,280
Here are some rice cakes.

319
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,198
I see.

320
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,201
I came last night but you weren't here.

321
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,370
I'll leave them here.

322
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,871
Just a second, please.

323
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,793
Thanks for the food.

324
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,217
Who sent you?

325
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,054
Was it John &amp; Mark...

326
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,236
We have an emergency patient.

327
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,593
Excuse us. Please make way.

328
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:43,870
Dal-geon?

329
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,764
Shit.

330
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,812
Police operator speaking.
How can I help you?

331
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,438
Someone's been kidnapped!

332
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,615
He is in critical condition and suffering
from chest discomfort and dyspnea.

333
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,826
We'll be arriving in 20 minutes.

334
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,580
Hurry up. He's waking up any minute.

335
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,165
Hang on.

336
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,962
Let's see...

337
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,385
Don't you know how to drive?

338
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,217
Damn it.

339
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,851
Shit.

340
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,206
Get up if you're not dead.

341
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,849
Are you mad?

342
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,643
We don't get paid for murders,
you dipshit.

343
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,856
-Hop on!
-Get the needle.

344
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,595
Over here!

345
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,847
Are you okay?

346
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,765
Are you okay, sir?

347
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,602
Try to stay still.
The ambulance will be here any minute.

348
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,770
Are you hurt?

349
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,317
I'm fine.

350
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,943
Then get in.

351
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,696
There's no time, get in!

352
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,618
You can't go. We received a kidnap call.

353
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,120
Hey, sir!

354
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,127
Listen.

355
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,237
You know about the the Blue House meeting
with the families, right?

356
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,157
Expose what you've just heard

357
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,576
in front of the President.

358
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,328
That piece of shit!

359
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,583
What if you get fired?

360
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,674
What about your family?

361
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:53,221
I'm the daughter of Colonel Go Gang-cheol,
Chief of the First Division,

362
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,431
and a marine hero.

363
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,355
Please don't look at me like that.

364
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,899
I'm so pissed off at myself, too.

365
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,285
Welcome.

366
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,870
This way, please.

367
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,844
Excuse me, sir.
What is your business here?

368
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,721
I'm a victim of the B357 crash.

369
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,930
You're late.

370
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,974
What is your name?

371
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,143
-Cha Dal-geon.
-Cha...

372
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,353
But I'm not on the guest list.

373
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,648
I'm afraid you cannot enter, then.

374
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,650
I'm with the NIS.

375
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,403
We really need to meet the President.
Let us in.

376
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,321
I'm sorry. Please leave.

377
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,949
Don't be sorry and just let us in.

378
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,661
I'm a victim, too.
How come they are allowed in and I'm not?

379
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,996
Open the gate.

380
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,749
Making a scene here
would only cause you trouble.

381
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,958
Trouble?

382
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,544
I'm a victim, too!

383
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,212
I need to see the President!

384
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,839
I want to see him!

385
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,174
-You can't.
-What?

386
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,509
-I understand.
-You are supposed to serve the people.

387
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,595
This is not acceptable! Let me go!

388
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,555
THE BLUE HOUSE TOUR BUS

389
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,192
Can you do it?

390
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,944
No matter how I try,
there is nothing on the news.

391
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,446
I have to do it.

392
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,996
Where are you going?
I told you to stay with mommy!

393
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,790
Here we go.

394
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,046
What have you got here? What is this?

395
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,508
Yes, good job.

396
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,134
Yes.

397
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,935
This is the script for today's meeting
with the families.

398
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,520
Is that necessary?

399
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,147
There are some who are upset.

400
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,440
In case of emergencies--

401
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,943
You should have filtered them out
from the list.

402
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,114
Accident victims
are not national heroes, are they?

403
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,992
Are they going to blame the government
if influenza breaks out?

404
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,412
Don't you think
this tie stands out too much?

405
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,874
I would prefer a plainer one.

406
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,586
Sang-min, come on. Smile.

407
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,381
Here we go. One, two...

408
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,424
Yes, thank you.

409
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,634
It looks nice.

410
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,594
Study hard.

411
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,519
Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

412
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,771
Did you not go, back at the Exhibit Hall?

413
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,692
I did but... My stomach hurts so much...

414
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,985
Follow me, please.

415
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,829
GUIDE MAP

416
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:08,207
CURRENT LOCATION
BLUE HOUSE MAIN OFFICE

417
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,834
The President of the Republic of Korea.

418
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,231
A tourist has gone missing.

419
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,336
This is control.
There is an intruder behind the annex.

420
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,552
Damn.

421
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,641
Follow him.

422
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,520
Stay here. And you go report this.

423
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,949
Stop!

424
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,784
Stop, sir!

425
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,497
Shit.

426
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,546
I'm a family member
of a plane crash victim.

427
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,880
I'm here to see the President.

428
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,216
-Arrest him.
-Stop.

429
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,884
I told you I'm a victim!

430
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,276
Let go.

431
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,113
Let me go, you bastards!

432
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,033
I need to see the President.

433
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,160
Tell him I'm here!

434
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,412
Let go of me!

435
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,456
-What's going on?
-Let go!

436
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,543
-He's an intruder.
-I'm a victim!

437
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,379
I came to meet the President.

438
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,381
Take him out.

439
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,467
-Let go!
-Let him in.

440
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,596
-We can't do that, sir.
-I'll take responsibility. Let him in.

441
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,139
That's a serious code violation.

442
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,517
Is anyone else here more serious
than that gentleman?

443
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,355
This is for us to decide.

444
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,775
-Even if you insist--
-How dare you disrespect the citizens!

445
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,946
This is exactly why they accuse us
of being authoritative.

446
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,785
-Please bring the gentleman in.
-Yes, sir.

447
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,581
Follow me, sir.

448
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,470
Chief, we have a problem.

449
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,933
As a person responsible
for the safety of the citizens,

450
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:58,312
I sincerely apologize to you once again.

451
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,525
Although the ICAO
is still examining the accident,

452
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:07,738
the government will also be taking
every possible measure,

453
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,284
such as performing its own investigation
and enacting special laws.

454
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,537
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

455
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,123
A bereaved family member...

456
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:25,381
There seems to be another guest,
waiting outside this room.

457
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,801
Bring him in.

458
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,804
-Mr. President--
-It's okay. Let him in.

459
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,360
Do not be disrespectful.

460
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,880
Good to meet you.

461
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,090
We welcome your visit.

462
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,342
Yes, sir.

463
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,554
Did the guards hurt you or...

464
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,264
No, sir.

465
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,893
Take a seat.
Help him to his seat.

466
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,730
The plane.

467
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,609
It wasn't a failure. It was attacked.

468
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,454
What do you mean by that?

469
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,041
I mean, the co-pilot of the aircraft

470
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:46,045
worked with the terrorist
and took down the plane.

471
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,009
We have reporters in this room.

472
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,511
Even though you are bereaved,

473
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,139
you will have to take full responsibility
for making false statements.

474
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,683
I'm not making false statements.

475
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,230
A video file showing the terrorist's face
disappeared inside the NIS!

476
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,863
Is this true, Director An?

477
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,449
Well, that's...

478
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,286
This is a conversation recording
between NIS agents.

479
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,333
Hurry up. This place is about to close.

480
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,751
Explain it to me.

481
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,128
The flash drive your team took.

482
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,297
Why is it infected with a virus?

483
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,341
How do you know that?

484
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,843
I saw it with my own eyes.

485
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,637
Then why do you need an explanation?

486
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,682
Are you covering this up?

487
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,394
The plane crash killed 211 people.

488
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,645
Director's orders.

489
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,980
-Huh?
-What the...

490
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,733
What is going on?

491
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,992
Come this way, sir.

492
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,966
Dal-geon!

493
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,928
Ms. O. Where's your husband?

494
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,724
Where is Kim Woo-gi, the co-pilot?

495
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,852
Why are you doing this to me?

496
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,271
You signed a five-billion-won
insurance policy under his name

497
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,606
and you're the beneficiary!

498
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,898
What?

499
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,287
My...

500
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,832
My husband's death is killing me!

501
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:49,877
I...

502
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,760
Sang-mi, talk!

503
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,261
Don't pass out. Talk to us!

504
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,064
Mr. Gi!

505
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,693
I don't have to meet Assemblyman Lee.

506
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,782
Go Hae-ri loaded her gun
and pulled the trigger, just now!

507
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,493
That kid!

508
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,703
Breaking news.

509
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,748
It's been claimed that a terrorist attack
had caused aircraft B357

510
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,542
to fall on the Moroccan seas last month.

511
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,836
Cha is consistently arguing

512
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,256
that B357 was intentionally crashed
and the attack was led...

513
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,383
Call Shadow.

514
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,259
...by John &amp; Mark,
a global defense industry.

515
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,512
-He must be busy right now.
-Just call him!

516
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,890
The victims' families held
an urgent press conference and requested

517
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,601
to expel the NIS Director,
and organize a special prosecution team,

518
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,937
in order to find out the truth
about the B357 crash.

519
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,606
The opposition party announced a statement
regarding the crash

520
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,818
and expressed severe criticism
against the ruling party.

521
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,200
The government's incompetence
and corruption--

522
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,412
You made the right choice
choosing Cha Dal-geon.

523
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,790
...they are busy
protecting the President's reputation.

524
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,836
Lobbying is not about weapons.

525
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,296
...irresponsible in its role
of protecting the citizens--

526
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,549
It's about people.

527
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:22,136
Regarding pointed out
as the one behind the terrorist attack,

528
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,512
John &amp; Mark says

529
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,849
they want to check the facts
through a thorough investigation.

530
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,101
The NIS says
it will thoroughly investigate

531
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,853
the people involved in the case

532
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:35,441
and check the whereabouts of Kim Woo-gi,
the co-pilot Cha mentioned.

533
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,547
CO-PILOT MIGHT BE ALIVE

534
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,600
What was wrong with me?

535
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,436
RESIGNATION LETTER

536
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,689
You're insane, Go Hae-ri.

537
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,570
You're out of your mind. You're crazy.

538
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,327
RESIGNATION LETTER

539
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,294
Let's have a word.

540
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,837
I...

541
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,341
I'm quite busy.

542
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,259
That resignation letter--

543
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,679
As an NIS agent,
I don't regret what I have done.

544
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,267
When I resign
and return to being a civilian,

545
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:57,439
you can expect
a proper human-to-human apology from me.

546
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,069
Go Hae-ri.

547
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,698
Come with me.

548
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,013
I'll take full responsibility and resign.

549
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,390
What?

550
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,809
Take responsibility?

551
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,853
Are you a chief or a deputy?

552
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,522
Who are you to take the blame?

553
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,692
My resignation letter.

554
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,404
Did you think that a letter

555
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,198
would help you quit in peace
and go home just like that?

556
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,285
You are on your way to jail.

557
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,495
For leaking confidential information.

558
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,455
Excuse me?

559
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,415
J...

560
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:59,001
-Jail?
-You.

561
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,837
You've never met Cha Dal-geon.

562
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,924
-What?
-Just play stupid.

563
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,051
You've never given him the recording.

564
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,804
But Cha Dal-geon--

565
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:13,098
He wouldn't want you
getting fired either.

566
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,852
I'll try to take all the bullets,
so you can just...

567
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,230
Just stand there and act shamelessly!

568
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,150
I'm good at being shameless...

569
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,237
But if I do that,
Mr. Gi will take all the blame--

570
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,156
You are worried about Gi?

571
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,783
What about me?

572
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,495
If you admit your mistake,
I'm the one who has to resign.

573
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,581
Because of a nitwit like you!

574
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,791
Do you think I'm worried about you?

575
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,171
Man, you really can't make
heads or tails of anything.

576
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,507
Oh god.

577
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,975
Damn it.

578
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,694
Don't mind us.

579
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,072
-You're supposed to drink it.
-I'm okay.

580
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,375
I heard you were kidnapped
on your way here.

581
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,293
Yes, um...

582
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,587
They have been trying to kill me
since Morocco.

583
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,881
Who might you be referring to?

584
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,383
John &amp; Mark.

585
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,553
The co-pilot was working for John &amp; Mark
until a year ago,

586
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,473
and his wife used to be
their flight attendant.

587
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,394
And the one that benefitted the most
out of the plane crash--

588
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:44,398
I am very much impressed by Mr. Cha.

589
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,610
Despite the kidnapping
and the murder attempt,

590
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,196
you've mustered the courage
to expose the truth.

591
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:00,539
Please wait and see
while I find out what exactly happened.

592
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,166
Thank you, Mr. President.

593
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,756
Could I ask you for a favor?

594
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,007
Please go on.

595
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,138
As for the NIS agents in the recording,
please don't let them get fired.

596
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,684
Well, that is not up to me to decide--

597
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,729
If it weren't for those people,
we would never have known this much.

598
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,897
Please, Mr. President.

599
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,985
I think it's not a bad idea.

600
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,155
Everyone in this country
is paying attention to the NIS.

601
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,032
I don't think firing those involved
would look good.

602
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,746
I give you my word.

603
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,628
Let's hope we have smiles on our faces
the next time we meet.

604
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,548
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much!

605
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,258
Thank you.

606
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,433
Yeah?

607
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,478
We were ordered to escort Mr. Cha
to the safe house.

608
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,605
Whose order is that?

609
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,691
I asked the Chief
of the Presidential Security Service.

610
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,777
It seems dangerous
now that his identity is revealed.

611
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,820
That's fine. You don't have to--

612
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,614
No, let's do what Yun says.

613
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,116
You are a very important person
from now on.

614
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,037
Is the house guarded
by the Security Service?

615
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,413
The NIS will be there.

616
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,416
I'll take him to the safe house.

617
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,548
-Thank you, sir.
-Take care.

618
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,020
I'm sorry, sir.

619
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,857
I'll see to it that this gets fixed...

620
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,074
You already spilled the soup
and scalded my balls.

621
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,158
Fix what?

622
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,911
Please give me a chance.
I can fix this, sir.

623
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,037
Quit your job.

624
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,916
I made a mistake.

625
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,835
Please forgive me.

626
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,921
I took a water tester of Han River
that you were,

627
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,840
and made you Director of the NIS.

628
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,884
The least you could do is earn your keep.

629
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,228
Director An, get up.

630
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,858
Tell me, Prime Minister.

631
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,319
How should we take care of this crisis?

632
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,322
I mean, is there any other way?

633
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,450
We have to fix the root of the problem.

634
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,621
Who do you think should fix it?

635
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,957
The police? The prosecutors?

636
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,792
That's even more stressful.

637
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,211
I think our best option
is to let Director An deal with it.

638
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,009
If you give me one more chance,
I'll do the best I can

639
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,594
and sort out this situation.

640
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,014
Don't fire the ones in the recording.

641
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,891
It will only gather attention.

642
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,642
Yes, sir.

643
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,654
What a pity.

644
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,948
To let John &amp; Mark go to waste like this.

645
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,368
Are you serious?

646
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,205
What can I do? Look at the mess we're in.

647
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,875
Just because you gave An the task,

648
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,836
it doesn't mean you can't take action
from time to time.

649
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,549
The truth?
We can reveal it in the way we want.

650
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,476
What the hell are you saying?
Why should I take the blame?

651
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,479
If a child plays with fire,
the parents should take the blame.

652
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,815
Don't you see how Go Hae-ri humiliated
the organization?

653
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:02,030
Go Hae-ri.
Are you the one who leaked the recording?

654
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:08,578
I thought you didn't know it existed.
And you never even met Cha Dal-geon.

655
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,878
Answer me, Go. I know you're not the one
who gave him the recording.

656
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,090
-Sorry--
-I'm the one.

657
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,845
I recorded it

658
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,973
and gave it to Cha Dal-geon.

659
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,017
Gi! What are you talking about?

660
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:36,189
That's not true. Mr. Gi doesn't even know
Cha Dal-geon. It was me.

661
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:39,359
Are the two of you playing games with me?

662
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,823
Aren't you guys embarrassed?

663
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,077
Two hundred civilians were killed

664
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,329
and we are busy covering it up.

665
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,957
Is it normal for us
to be blaming these two?

666
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,712
This is why people blame us all the time.
They call us useless and irresponsible.

667
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,921
Hey, Gang.

668
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,590
We are not here
to listen to your complaints.

669
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,051
Want to get straightforward?

670
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,305
Who here believes
that the video was infected by a virus?

671
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,894
We all know someone deleted it,
yet we are turning a blind eye to it.

672
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,897
It's good that you brought it up.

673
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,190
Gi Tae-ung.

674
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,902
Is there any sign of hacking
from outside the NIS?

675
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,154
No, sir.

676
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:27,615
That means someone inside the NIS
personally planted the virus.

677
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,745
Even the security camera recordings
were intentionally deleted on that day.

678
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,330
You have to be a Chief or above

679
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,499
to enter the control room, right?

680
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,793
Was it you, Min?

681
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,796
Are you nuts?

682
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,883
I'm the one who got screwed
because of this case.

683
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,217
Fucking hell.

684
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,679
I thought it was you.

685
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,308
-What?
-You can't stand me being successful.

686
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,226
Weren't you trying to screw me over?

687
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,770
You bastard!

688
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,063
Excuse me.

689
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,484
The Director wants to talk to all of us.

690
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,432
Our President

691
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,893
has given us one more chance.

692
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,395
Starting with the B357 incident,

693
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,731
do your best

694
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,234
in doing your part for national security

695
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,445
and maximizing the benefit of our country.

696
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,282
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

697
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,578
One, we always think and act

698
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,164
on the side of justice and truth.

699
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,960
One, we always predict and prepare

700
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:05,296
to guarantee national security.

701
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,591
One, we are always aware
that losing one's honor

702
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,594
is equal to losing honor as a whole.

703
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,560
Do you think we should run
a drug test on him?

704
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:22,730
How can he not fire you
for leaking confidential information?

705
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,607
You can say that I'm an unlucky person,

706
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,026
but I hit the jackpot,
when it comes to my career.

707
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:32,991
Hey, who do you think is the dirty traitor
who deleted the video file?

708
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,034
I don't know.

709
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,454
It can't be Chief Min,
looking at the way he acted.

710
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,539
It can't be Chief Gang, either.

711
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,791
Chief Park from Inspection?

712
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,209
-Or Chief Choi--
-That's right--

713
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,714
Hello, sir.

714
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,179
Hey, Hwa-suk!

715
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,478
I would like to formally apologize.

716
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,937
About the recording.

717
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,565
I didn't intend to pin it on you.

718
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,985
Things got out of control so quickly and--

719
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,322
It's true.

720
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,491
I didn't mean to cause you trouble--

721
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,617
Well done.

722
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,844
Close your mouth, girl,
before flies get in!

723
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:39,349
He just praised me.

724
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,227
I just heard this from Se-hun.

725
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,729
You weren't the only one
with the recording.

726
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:48,191
Mr. Gi didn't tell you but... Come here.

727
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,963
Why is he so late?

728
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,800
Did Shadow say he's coming?

729
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,302
Are you saying I'm hearing things?

730
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,641
It's just that he doesn't move easily.

731
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,980
Damn it.

732
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:34,237
How dare he mess up the face of an angel?

733
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,953
Cha Dal-geon, that bastard.
How should I shred him into pieces?

734
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,420
Yes, Mr. Hong.

735
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:56,134
What do you think?
I'm getting ready for a revenge match.

736
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,927
You can stop now.

737
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,930
What are you talking about?

738
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,725
Don't you want Cha Dal-geon dead?

739
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,226
Another team will take over.

740
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,606
Is this because...

741
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,276
you don't trust me?

742
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,298
Cha Dal-geon is going
to the NIS' safehouse now.

743
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,009
How does that matter?

744
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,220
It's not easy there, it's dangerous.

745
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,850
So it's dangerous for me,
but not for the other guy?

746
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,275
Who is it?

747
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,569
Who's the asshole that snatched my client?

748
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,407
They are deadly and very brutal.

749
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,704
Send him in.

750
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,584
Shadow himself is here at last.

751
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,143
You...

752
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,065
Want one?

753
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,318
Thanks.

754
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,830
Go get the empty plates now.

755
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,374
With Cha Dal-geon's head on them.

756
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:03,219
