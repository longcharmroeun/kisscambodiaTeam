We are collecting signatures
to find out the truth about B357!

2
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,995
WHAT HAS THE GOVERNMENT DONE
FOR THE B357 ACCIDENT?

3
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,247
Your participation matters
in finding out the truth!

4
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,624
Please participate.

We are collecting signatures
to find out the truth about B357!

6
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,590
We are collecting signatures
to find out the truth about B357!

7
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,093
Your participation matters

8
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,511
Please sign the petition.

9
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,972
We are collecting signatures
to find out the truth about--

10
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:42,060
Those among the bereaved families
who don't play along with us,

11
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,273
they hate the government for everything,
just like the bloody commies.

12
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,860
It's not only them.

13
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,615
You know Gi
and those who follow Gang, right?

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,037
I'm watching their phones
and listening to their calls.

15
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,541
They are all on my radar around the clock.

16
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,169
So don't you worry, Yun.

17
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,338
What about Edward?

18
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,424
Of course, we are watching him, too.

19
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,136
We'll tap his phone
when the warrant is issued.

20
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,640
The civil trial for the bereaved
will be held on the 15th, next month.

21
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,642
Exactly.

22
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,061
If Kim Woo-gi doesn't show up until then,

23
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,230
it'll finally be game over.

24
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,108
What if he does?

25
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:36,281
I assure you,
he will never set foot on this country.

26
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,908
We basically own this country.

27
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,661
Do you think he has even a tiny chance?

28
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,663
Hell, no.

29
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,250
I'd love to see them try.

30
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,547
REST IN PEACE, GANG JU-CHEOL

31
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,632
Chief Gang is alive?

32
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,345
But the doctor announced his death
right in front of me.

33
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,390
How can he be alive? Is he Jesus?

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,268
There's no time, so listen carefully.

35
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,690
ONE WEEK BEFORE

36
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,915
This is Edward from Dynamic.

37
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,625
Don't talk. Just listen.

38
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,296
The phone you're holding right now
is synced to Chief Min Jae-sik's phone.

39
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,965
He can see where you are
and what you are doing.

40
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,053
As you know,
the situation here is disastrous.

41
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,513
If no one inside the NIS helps us,

42
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,267
he will never stand in court
even if he comes in.

43
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,647
I beg you, Mr. Gi.

44
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,982
You have to help us.

45
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,694
Soon, your phone will be tapped as well.

46
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,820
Be careful.

47
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,452
Put that in Gang's meal
and make sure he eats it.

48
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,037
What is it?

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,288
Nothing.

50
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,834
He'll just have a seizure
and then a fatal heart attack.

51
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,379
We can't have an autopsy.

52
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,881
He has no family anyway,

53
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,508
so just sign him out

54
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,927
for cremation.

55
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,723
What are we supposed to do now?

56
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,192
Hello, it's Bullet Chicken.
We deliver faster than a bullet.

57
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,112
Sorry, we're closed for today.
No delivery now.

58
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,905
-I'm sorry.
-This...

59
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,865
This is Gi Tae-ung.

60
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,202
Let me.

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,288
Thank you.

62
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,014
SOUP/POISON/CPK3061/VAGABOND

63
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,852
CPK3... What does it do?

64
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,276
It's a secret poison,
used only by a few Black agents.

65
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,160
Sir!

66
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,164
Please open your eyes!

67
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,500
Get off me! Sir!

68
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,919
If he doesn't take the antidote
within five minutes,

69
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,254
he'll never wake up.

70
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,632
You guys must be out of your minds!

71
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,260
What if it actually kills him?

72
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,179
Hae-ri will show up with Kim Woo-gi.

73
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,057
Someone has to help Chief Gang.

74
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,351
Why are you doing this to me?

75
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,394
What did I do wrong?

76
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,147
For crying out loud!

77
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,441
This really is a bad year for me.

78
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,863
Don't worry. Mr. Gi isn't a traitor.

79
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,740
How do you know?

80
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,659
If he were,
he would've killed us at the embassy.

81
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,078
Hang on a second.

82
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,413
If the government is in on it,

83
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,290
then this is beyond my ability.

84
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,000
I know you're not capable.

85
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,920
I wish it weren't you.

86
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,882
However, now you're the only one
I can entrust this grave task.

87
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,718
-070--
-070-1584-1779

88
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,013
-Codename Vagabond.
-Call that number before you return.

89
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,269
Welcome, Go Hae-ri.

90
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,106
Who is...

91
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,691
Gang Ju-cheol?

92
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,779
How dare you call me by my name?

93
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,615
Chief!

94
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,575
Where are you?

95
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,953
We're smuggling ourselves on a ship.

96
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,705
For now, give me the time and place
of your arrival.

97
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,290
On the 15th, at 9 a.m.

98
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,001
We'll be disembarking
at Incheon Container Terminal No. 1.

99
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,088
The container number, KHCH 35679-19.

100
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,840
15TH, 09:00, INCHEON CONTAINER TERMINAL 1
KHCH 35679-19

101
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,386
-You must be bored in that cargo ship.
-Excuse me?

102
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,181
Min Jae-sik is desperate
to catch you guys.

103
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,392
We need to come up with a diversion.

104
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,768
We found Kim Woo-gi!

105
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,230
What's going on?

106
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,818
Where is it?

107
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,154
Port of Tarifa, south of Spain.

108
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,363
They are on a ship?

109
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,740
-Yes.
-Where are they headed?

110
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,826
Morocco.

111
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,830
They just escaped from there.
Why would they go back?

112
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,166
Kim Woo-gi is here, too!

113
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,001
What? Where?

114
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,504
Charles de Gaulle Airport, France.

115
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,506
Is this feed live?

116
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,509
What are they, Doctor Strange?

117
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,760
He's here, too!

118
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,846
Port of Naples, Italy.

119
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,224
They're at Antalya Airport, Turkey, too!

120
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,311
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

121
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,772
That's Cha Dal-geon!

122
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,195
What's going on?

123
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,157
I appreciate your hardworking
day and night for the nation.

124
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,576
What the hell?

125
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,120
Even Mr. Yun is there.

126
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,416
Hey, Gi Tae-ung.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,629
You pretended to be all righteous,
so how do you live with yourself?

128
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,255
What the fuck...

129
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,592
Min Jae-sik.
I won't even bother calling you names.

130
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,385
Son of a...

131
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,804
You're all...

132
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,099
...absolutely fucked up, assholes!

133
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,186
Because I am...

134
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,356
...soon going to destroy you.

135
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,442
Turn it off.

136
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,654
-Huh?
-Cut him off right now!

137
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,492
Yes, sir.

138
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,872
What's wrong, Yun?

139
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,124
How long does it take to trace him?

140
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,711
Five minutes at best.
But it might take even days.

141
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,047
Make everyone wear a receiver.

142
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,758
Prepare to welcome our guest again.

143
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,135
Do you think Cha will come back?

144
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,304
He showed up for a reason.

145
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,223
I'm sure.

146
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,517
He will come back.

147
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,352
Oh...

148
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,895
Everyone, stand by.

149
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,481
-Get your receivers.
-Yes, sir.

150
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,816
Yes, sir.

151
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,025
Gi.

152
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,029
What do you think Cha wants?

153
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,783
I think he wants evidence.

154
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,076
Evidence?

155
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,912
O Sang-mi's press conference
turned the tables around.

156
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,874
He must be thinking
Kim's testimony is not enough.

157
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,129
So he wants us to slip
and say something incriminating?

158
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,882
That bastard is trying
to pull a petty trick on us.

159
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,469
Cha Dal-geon and Go Hae-ri
are Kim Woo-gi's kidnappers.

160
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,098
Gi, tell them to turn themselves in

161
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,766
and stall time.

162
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,934
Yes, sir.

163
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,106
They cut us off first.

164
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,567
What are they playing at?

165
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,277
They're taking the initiative.

166
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,738
They also need time
to trace your current location.

167
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,490
But the NIS has the latest technology.

168
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,492
Are you sure we are okay?

169
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,702
Don't worry about that.

170
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,455
What in the world is
in that chicken place?

171
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,168
CONSPIRACY THEORY

172
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,600
You're doing it again!

173
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,020
I told you not to grab chickens
with that nose-picking finger of yours.

174
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,104
Okay.

175
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,732
-It's disgusting.
-Okay.

176
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,693
You can call them donkeys,
and call us stallions.

177
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,238
Anyway, you need to stay alert
when you're against Yun Han-gi.

178
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,366
Tracing your IP might not work,

179
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,118
but he can still catch you
based only on a couple of words.

180
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,038
It sounds dangerous.
Do we really have to play it this way?

181
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,792
Even Gi Tae-ung is being watched.

182
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,960
We need to sneak behind their backs,

183
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,213
or we'll never bring Kim Woo-gi
back home.

184
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,175
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

185
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,475
Get started.

186
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,476
Yes.

187
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,566
Pyramid, pyramid...

188
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,197
Code break...

189
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,825
Code break...

190
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,507
They are back in!

191
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,259
Put it on!

192
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,514
I can't believe you guys.

193
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,100
How rude. We are valuable informants.

194
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,311
Informants, my ass. You are kidnappers.

195
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,189
Mr. Gi, you are so shameless.

196
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,858
How can you lie like this

197
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,152
when you already know the truth?

198
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,779
Stop committing any more crimes.
Turn yourself in.

199
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,615
What, crimes? Crimes?

200
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,868
Hey.

201
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,370
How dare you mention that word?

202
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,414
All those people died for nothing

203
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,458
and you're killing them
for the second time!

204
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,710
Is that what civil servants
are paid to do?

205
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,755
They are pissing me off.

206
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,923
Any progress on the trace?

207
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,593
The IP address is very complicated.

208
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,137
Hurry the hell up, you stupid.

209
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,308
I'm Senior Secretary for this country.

210
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,271
Did you say "for this country"?
Aren't you embarrassed?

211
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,774
The truth is for the government
to find out.

212
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,777
You only need to bring me Kim Woo-gi.

213
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,863
Hey, let me ask you something.

214
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,783
Are you the boss of all this?

215
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,493
Or...

216
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,206
Are you taking orders from the President?

217
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,222
I'm asking if the President
is ordering you to do this.

218
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,563
Wait, nope. I asked the wrong question.

219
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,442
If you say no, you become a traitor.

220
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,487
If you say yes,
that would make the President an asshole.

221
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,698
Well, my bad. I take that question back.

222
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,749
Edward Park is in custody.

223
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,794
Dynamic cannot protect you now.

224
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,379
Bring Kim Woo-gi to us,

225
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,092
and Mr. Yun here will do his best
to meet your demands.

226
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,054
You will meet our demands?

227
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,936
In that case,

228
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,774
I want all of you to come clean
in front of the whole country.

229
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,526
Then I'll turn myself in.

230
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,328
I said I'll turn myself in, bastards!

231
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,830
Why are you all quiet?

232
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:33,998
Yes, Chief.

233
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,625
-Finish it now.
-Yes, sir.

234
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,129
Edward's secretary. Was it Micky?

235
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,466
Don't tell her anything about Vagabond.

236
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,269
I suggest you repent...

237
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,856
...and live a new life,
you bunch of garbage!

238
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,859
Did you trace them?

239
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,653
Um, you should take a look at this.

240
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,698
What the hell is all this?

241
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,868
These are the IP waypoints
I managed to find.

242
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,663
Europe, Japan, China, Turkey, India...

243
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,415
There are 43 locations.

244
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,459
Damn it. Why is it so complicated?

245
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,670
Analyze Cha Dal-geon's video,

246
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,089
and get someone better than you

247
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,050
to trace that IP, okay?

248
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,468
Move it!

249
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,761
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,357
Looking at the hacking skill,
Edward must be behind them.

251
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,026
What should we do?
We have to release him soon.

252
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,111
Darn it...

253
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,378
You may leave.

254
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,016
I believe you people enjoy eavesdropping.

255
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,436
Keep the watch as well.

256
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,232
I don't like using stuff
that someone else has touched.

257
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,362
Chief Min.

258
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,032
I'm mad with you,

259
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,535
but the person next to you...

260
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,496
...makes me more mad.

261
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,421
This is not only about the F-X plan.

262
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,800
It's a battle between truth and lies,
good and evil.

263
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,469
Lies cannot bury the truth.

264
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,182
And evil cannot defeat good.
Our history proves that. But why!

265
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,309
Why can't you see that...

266
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,438
...when you have power?

267
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,735
Senior Secretary Yun Han-gi.

268
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:55,991
What happened here?

269
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,868
I also just got here.

270
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,956
We are in the middle of the ocean.
He can't escape.

271
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,336
You two should stay together.
I'll look for him alone.

272
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,341
If you make a mistake
and end up killing Kim--

273
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,719
Don't worry. I don't make mistakes.

274
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,523
Hey, Kim.

275
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,904
Stop wasting time and show yourself.

276
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,542
Don't move!

277
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,797
Get a boat ready. A motorboat.

278
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,134
If you don't, I will kill this bitch.

279
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,264
No matter what you do, you can't escape.

280
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,390
Shut the hell up!

281
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,975
She's bleeding, you bastard!

282
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,643
Go on and move, you shit.

283
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,603
Let's see what happens to her.

284
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,274
After the trial,
do you think they'll let me live?

285
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:15,154
Even if I make it to Korea,
I will never testify on your orders.

286
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,656
I won't! It'll get me killed!

287
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,950
You shameless piece of shit.

288
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,078
Shame? Name someone who does have shame.

289
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,955
The Blue House? The NIS?

290
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,416
You are no different!

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,376
You're so obsessed with revenge.

292
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,712
You don't even blink an eye
for the people that die!

293
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,547
-Shut up, you prick!
-You little...

294
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,220
Just give him what he wants.

295
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,396
Get the damn boat already
and send him away!

296
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,858
Are you mad?

297
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,237
-Now that we finally caught him!
-He says he's going to kill me.

298
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,489
Don't you see the blood on my neck?

299
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,534
Hey, he won't kill you. Trust me.

300
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,495
What if he does?
Do you even care about my life?

301
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,707
Why are you so afraid?
You're a NIS special agent!

302
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,752
Do you think the government supplies us
a couple of extra lives?

303
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,337
Whatever. Just die, then!

304
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,463
What did you just say?

305
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,924
-You're worse than Kim Woo-gi.
-What was that?

306
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,967
What do you think you are doing--

307
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,688
Let me see.

308
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,357
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

309
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,317
You're bleeding a lot!

310
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,361
-I'm okay.
-I might as well just--

311
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,570
Hey, don't do it.

312
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,905
Stop.

313
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,824
Should I just kill him? My gosh.

314
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,332
Let me see.

315
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,334
That was so close.

316
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,089
Don't you think
my shoulder throw was awesome?

317
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,466
The guy who taught me
must've been proud.

318
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,302
Here.

319
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,556
Ouch, wait! It stings...

320
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,517
Blow on it.

321
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,352
-What?
-Blow some air on it.

322
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,189
Oh, it stings!

323
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,150
-Is that okay?
-Harder.

324
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,111
Wait...

325
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,862
It hurts!

326
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,963
It hurts so much.

327
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,802
Why is your face so red?

328
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,096
Do you have a fever?

329
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,682
What are you talking about?

330
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,976
I think you have a fever.

331
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,061
You do!

332
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,231
Hey, I have no fever. No.

333
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,110
Maybe you got scratched by a nail
during the fight.

334
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,111
If you're infected--

335
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,655
No, I'm totally fine.
I didn't get hurt at all.

336
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,032
Nothing's wrong.

337
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,076
Even your ears are red.

338
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,081
Oh, this is because Kim pissed me off!
I mean it!

339
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,876
-That bastard...
-Well, if you say so...

340
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,170
Hey, um, I need to go to the toilet.

341
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,215
I'll put the ointment on myself.

342
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,530
Do I...

343
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,451
Do I know you from somewhere?

344
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,497
You look strangely familiar.

345
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,793
Do you take business trips to Europe?

346
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,216
How much do you get from Dynamic?
I can pay you tenfold.

347
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,468
Maybe even more. Double?

348
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,900
We have now met quorum.

349
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,694
From now on, for the purpose

350
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,572
of securing future growth,

351
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,410
expanding social overhead capital,

352
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,871
and introducing
next-generation fighter jets,

353
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:39,960
we will take a vote for the approval
of the revised budget plan.

354
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,886
Sir, we already know the results.
Why are you so nervous?

355
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,348
As a politician, I never believe it
when I'm told not to worry.

356
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,518
I'd rather trust a merchant
who claims he's selling at a loss.

357
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,440
I will now declare the results.

358
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,234
Out of 259 members...

359
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:13,285
A total of 194 were in favor, 55 against,

360
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,287
and 10 abstained.

361
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:20,250
I hereby announce
that the new budget is approved.

362
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,005
We got it!

363
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,465
Congratulations, sir.

364
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,927
Well done, Minister Park.

365
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,637
Director An.

366
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,765
You shouldn't forget Yun, too.
He had a major role.

367
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,810
Thank you, Secretary Yun.

368
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,145
You're welcome, sir.

369
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,483
This calls for a celebration.
Let's go and have a feast.

370
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,486
Make a reservation at Anilok.
I'm paying today.

371
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,404
Yes, sir.

372
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,074
-Minister Park.
-Yes.

373
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,328
Seal the deal with John &amp; Mark right away.

374
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,040
Our people are calling for it.

375
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,083
Yes, sir.

376
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,505
REPUBLIC OF KOREA AIRFORCE
PROCUREMENT AGREEMENT

377
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,892
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

378
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:37,619
Now, for the tremendous success in
our future business, let's have a toast.

379
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,620
Yes.

380
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,039
Minister, would you like to do the honors?

381
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,460
-Me?
-You worked more than anyone for this.

382
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,758
To our future! Love! Work!

383
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,051
Missile launch!

384
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,886
Missile launch!

385
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,559
You sure know how to propose a toast.

386
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,646
I've prepared something, too.

387
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,024
These are a few of my prized possessions.

388
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,277
I'd like to throw an auction.

389
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,283
-Did you say "auction"?
-Don't be afraid.

390
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,326
I'm not taking money.

391
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,371
You are to bet on these
by showing me some sincerity.

392
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,083
And how would you like us to do that?

393
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,543
Well...

394
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,754
You can write me a letter.

395
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,799
Or you can pour me a glass.

396
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,971
If that's the case,
I can bet as much as you want.

397
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:45,103
This is a 1910 drawing
by a painter named Anek,

398
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,565
an impressionist artist
known for his unique drawing style.

399
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,985
The separated colors emphasize
the purity of the tones.

400
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,945
The colors were not mixed on a palette.

401
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,032
They were both mixed and used
on the canvas itself.

402
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,536
This one was drawn
by Woldam Kim Seong-hun.

403
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,749
An extremely famous artist,
I believe you already know.

404
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,878
I think you are all wondering
about the market price.

405
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,340
On the black market,
it is traded for about 400,000 dollars.

406
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,384
Dear me.

407
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,141
Excuse me for a moment.

408
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,685
Mr. Hong will continue with the auction.

409
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,731
Let me introduce you to the next painting.

410
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,651
I'm listening.

411
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,364
Right now?

412
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,339
Don't get up.

413
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,384
How rude of you.

414
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,928
I came here as soon as possible
and you made me wait.

415
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,431
Let's talk business
before we start eating.

416
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,060
Can't we start with the eating first?

417
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,604
As for the agreed amount...

418
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,857
You can send it to this account.

419
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,528
You are so lame.

420
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,612
DEEP BLUE

421
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,657
-"Deep Blue"?
-It's a trading company in Singapore.

422
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,581
Hong, got the account number?

423
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,417
Send the money we prepared.

424
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,796
The President must be in such a hurry.

425
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,510
It'll obviously be a paper company.

426
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,721
But whose is it?

427
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,058
I mean, the President
can't possibly be the CEO.

428
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,144
You just need to send the money.

429
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:54,441
You know that five percent
of the bid is huge, right?

430
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,611
I worked my ass off
to get the money prepared.

431
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,492
Yes, I get it.

432
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,703
You want me to get to the chase?

433
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,414
But I am a bit disappointed.

434
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,752
I was hoping to hear
some kind of a compliment, at least.

435
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,090
Check the account.

436
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,617
Pick your food.

437
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,952
Can I order drinks?

438
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,371
Yes, but I don't drink when I work.

439
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,377
Please set me up a dinner meeting
with the President.

440
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:02,717
I have a business opportunity,
perfect for his taste.

441
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,230
What? A deal?

442
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,274
The MND and John &amp; Mark
already signed a deal.

443
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,568
They will announce it soon.

444
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,989
But the trial hasn't even started.

445
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:29,285
How rotten are you guys?
Can we trust the justice department?

446
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,330
Kim Woo-gi's testimony won't be enough.

447
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,958
We need a solid piece of evidence.

448
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,419
Darn it...

449
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,444
-This is...
-What are you doing?

450
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,072
Why did you lock yourselves in?

451
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,492
What's wrong with this door?
Did you lock it, Hae-ri?

452
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,120
Huh? Was it me?

453
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,876
We were about to eat noodles.
Would you like some?

454
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,970
How long have you been working for Edward?

455
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,393
I saw you earlier and...
You seemed to know how to use guns.

456
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,064
We get trained, all the lobbyists.

457
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,361
I guess you're right. It's like
a car salesman needs a driver's license.

458
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,865
I'm getting off this ship
at the next stop.

459
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,828
It wouldn't be good for the trial
if we arrive together.

460
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,166
Anyway, thanks for your help, Micky.

461
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,384
Hey.

462
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,095
Do you have any evidence?

463
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:18,436
I don't mean a testimony or hearsay.
Something we can submit to the court.

464
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,731
Did you know...

465
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,692
that Michael had a girlfriend?

466
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,362
I know he had a mistress.

467
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,322
What about it?

468
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,574
You asked me earlier,

469
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,701
about how I met Michael.

470
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,960
I met Michael through his girlfriend.

471
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,295
That woman...

472
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,049
was the one
who introduced Jerome to Michael.

473
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,879
-She was Asian.
-Her face?

474
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,218
Did you see her face?

475
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,435
Maybe?

476
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,153
Did you ask for proof?

477
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,156
There is one.

478
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,824
A good one.

479
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,287
What is it?

480
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:04,709
A video file
of me and Michael making a deal.

481
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,679
What's your agenda?

482
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,889
What do you mean?

483
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,308
Why are you being helpful all of a sudden?

484
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,482
I don't think he wants my help. Come on.

485
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,778
I'll just go back to being quiet again.

486
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,626
If what Kim said is true,
it will turn this country upside down.

487
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,253
I don't think he is lying, sir.

488
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,633
You're arriving tomorrow, right?
Give me the time and location again.

489
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,469
9 a.m. tomorrow,
Incheon Container Terminal No. 1.

490
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,388
Container number, KHCH 35679-19.

491
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,393
TOMORROW

492
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,314
Gi and I will be waiting there.

493
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,567
I thought Gi was under surveillance.
How can he come?

494
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,820
That's why we need a good finale.

495
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,447
You guys will need to set it up nicely.

496
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,119
Don't worry. I'm a pretty good actress.

497
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,997
Min has sharp eyes.

498
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,415
Be careful.

499
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,255
I need you to give this to Gi.

500
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,634
What about the rent?

501
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,928
I partly own this restaurant.

502
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:43,558
Seriously? You only paid two million won.
Wasn't that for my husband's funeral?

503
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,601
Come on. I'm in a hurry.

504
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:50,898
Jeez, it's bad enough that my husband
got killed, working for the NIS.

505
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,067
Move aside.

506
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,655
Jang-su!

507
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,908
Hey, Gye Jang-su.

508
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,536
Hello?

509
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,163
Yes.

510
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,256
Send this in code.

511
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,258
It's been a while. Can you do it?

512
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,551
Yes.

513
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,220
Thank you.

514
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,972
Gosh, whatever.

515
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,809
Tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Incheon Container
Terminal No. 1. KHCH 35679-19.

516
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,019
Boy, he's happy.

517
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,232
35679, 1... 19.

518
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,696
This one.

519
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,457
TOMORROW

520
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,092
INCHEON

521
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,679
9:00 A.M.

522
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,477
CONTAINER
TERMINAL

523
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,901
Container Terminal No. 1.

524
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,948
35679, beep!

525
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,504
TTOBONG'S CHICKEN,
THIRTY PERCENT DISCOUNT FOR ALL MENUS

526
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,298
Mr. Gi received a text message.

527
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,553
Open it.

528
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,306
TTOBONG'S CHICKEN

529
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,558
Looks like a spam message.

530
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,686
Check if it's a real business.

531
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,647
We order food from here often, sir.

532
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,612
I swear I've never seen him
eat chicken before.

533

558
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,014
Hey...

559
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,725
Let me see that.

560
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,945
"The History of Korean Intelligence."

561
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,740
If you read while you're in the can,

562
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,701
you might get constipation.

563
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,210
You.

564
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,380
You're talking to Go Hae-ri, right?

565
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,760
It doesn't really make sense,
no matter how much I think about it.

566
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,763
To see a skilled hunter like you
let a target go,

567
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,182
especially such an amateur as Go Hae-ri...

568
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,980
"A colleague behind your back

569
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,691
can become your worst enemy."

570
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,321
It's a quote from page 147 of this book.

571
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,115
That's exactly why...

572
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,201
...I'm always bothered by you.

573
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,204
I'm worried you might stab me in the back.

574
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,709
That means you think of me
as a colleague, at least.

575
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,134
Chief, Go Hae-ri is turning herself in.

576
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,136
Turning herself in?

577
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,853
Wait, um, there's Go Hae-ri.

578
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,816
I can't talk for long, sir.

579
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,738
-First, I'd like to apologize--
-Cut the crap and just answer my question.

580
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,948
Are you giving up?

581
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,493
-Yes.
-Where are you?

582
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:40,581
But I think it's only right
that you hear my demands first,

583
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,166
before anything else.

584
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,044
And what might those be?

585
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,171
Please take me back.

586
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,757
Okay, fine.

587
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,884
Where are you now?

588
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,721
And, um, since you're taking me back,

589
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,306
I'd like a two-rank promotion--

590
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,850
Why would I ever give you a two-rank...

591
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,233
Fine, you got it.
Just tell me where you are.

592
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,486
We're in New Delhi, India.

593
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,988
What? India?

594
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,073
New Delhi.

595
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,160
We cannot go anywhere
because Kim was shot.

596
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,372
If you get on the first flight tomorrow,
I'll be at the airport.

597
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,043
Was it Edward Park
who got you out of the embassy?

598
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,254
Shh!

599
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,007
It's Cha Dal-geon, I have to go.
First flight tomorrow!

600
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,469
Is her IP address in India?

601
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,471
We couldn't trace it, sir.

602
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,014
Damn it.

603
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,560
Get me a ticket
for the earliest flight tomorrow.

604
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,686
Yes, sir.

605
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:48,023
You guys stay here and keep guard.
I'm going there alone.

606
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,249
How was I?

607
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:09,086
It was just the right amount
of awkwardness.

608
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,755
Do you know how hard it is
to get that right?

609
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,632
Okay.

610
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,476
You recorded the video call, right?

611
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,561
Yes, sir.

612
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,022
Bring it to my room,

613
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,648
without Gi knowing about it.

614
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,442
Why do you need it?

615
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,737
I think I saw something.

616
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,411
Was it Edward Park
who got you out of the embassy?

617
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:44,913
Shh!

618
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,498
Stop!

619
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,168
Zoom in.

620
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,173
Turn it sideways.

621
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,344
It's five o'clock.

622
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,016
So the time difference is either
one hour or 13 hours.

623
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,518
But India is three and a half hours late.

624
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,480
Come on, Go Hae-ri.

625
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,107
Do you think you can fool me?

626
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,404
Look for the places with a time difference
of one or 13 hours.

627
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,657
Focus on smuggling brokers.

628
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,326
And don't let Gi's group find out.

629
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,744
Yes, sir.

630
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:32,336
I can't imagine Go Hae-ri coming up
with this kind of plan.

631
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,882
Even Edward Park
is not an expert in this area.

632
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,429
I wonder who's helping them.

633
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,840
What the hell?

634
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,219
Hey, it's nothing like that. I...

635
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,638
I was pulling down the shirt for you.

636
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,890
Then what was that look?

637
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,808
How are you...

638
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,395
How am I supposed to look
when I wake up in the middle of my sleep?

639
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,855
What do you take me for?

640
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,654
Why aren't you sleeping?
Are you worried about tomorrow?

641
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,115
You're not scared, are you?

642
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,701
No way...

643
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,286
Stop tossing in your sleep!

644
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,209
Why are you sweeping around the floor
while you sleep?

645
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,836
-You're keeping me up.
-Hey...

646
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,005
You must be insane!

647
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,423
Did you observe me?

648
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,800
Do you...

649
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,469
Do you know how many times
you slapped me in your sleep?

650
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,555
You're no better.
Stop snoring and grinding your teeth.

651
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,391
I wonder who is going to share
a bed with you later.

652
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,310
God help him!

653
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:57,022
I wonder who you are going to share
a bed with, gosh!

654
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,485
-I feel sorry for her already.
-You are hopeless.

655
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,028
I already feel so sorry for him.

656
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,553
Good morning, sir.

657
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,481
What is it?

658
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,442
We found Kim Woo-gi.

659
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,236
Where is he?

660
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,446
On a ship.

661
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,617
It's a Chinese merchant ship
named Poseidon.

662
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,912
It leaves Shanghai
and arrives in Gwangyang at 10 a.m.

663
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,506
Are you sure?

664
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,633
Yes, I'm sure.

665
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,930
There is an informant in China
called Polaris,

666
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,681
and Go Hae-ri contacted him.

667
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,143
Don't arrest him.

668
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:02,606
Take him out at all costs.

669
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,777
NIS
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

670
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,626
He's going to pass out if he finds out
that Polaris is Chief Gang.

671
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,964
Was it Incheon?

672
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,299
When are we leaving, sir?

673
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,231
Darn it.

674
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,652
I never go well with these revolvers.

675
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,612
Why do South Korean cops use this?

676
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,449
Stop blaming the tool, you amateur.

677
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,333
So tell me.

678
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,419
How much do you make?

679
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,839
Why are you so obsessed
with prying into other's income?

680
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,341
You're the one who's not answering
a simple question.

681
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,385
You'll never do what I do.

682
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,178
You can't speak English.

683
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,638
You can do that for me.

684
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,683
So you just want to hop on my ride?

685
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,854
Piss off, please. Okay?

686
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,820
Yes, sir.

687
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,742
Okay.

688
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,954
Where are you off to?

689
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,582
Pissing off. Why do you care?

690
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,128
Hey!

691
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,714
Itaewon?

692
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,508
Why would Tae-ung go there?

693
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,843
Where are you?

694
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,889
Keeping a 10-minute distance from Gi.

695
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,642
Keep a close eye on him
until I get back to Seoul.

696
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,398
SPEED QUICK

697
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,664
He turned towards Hannam Bridge.

698
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,293
Stop reporting and just go after him.

699
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,503
Yes, sir.

700
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,441
We arrive in Incheon in an hour.

701
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,944
Min can't catch up on us, right?

702
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:57,447
Don't worry.
He's not smart enough for Mr. Gi.

703
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,705
Why are we crossing the bridge again?

704
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,999
Gi's heading to Gangbuk.

705
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,292
Son of a bitch.

706
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,211
Why is he going back and forth...

707
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,259
-Catch up to him.
-What?

708
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,094
Get close to that prick, you idiot!

709
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,026
Damn that piece of shit...

710
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,529
Get that guy. Get the bike!

711
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:56,923
Where's Gi Tae-ung?

712
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,805
Sir.

713
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,185
Son of a bitch!

714
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,981
What the hell are you saying?
What do you mean our information leaked?

715
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,150
We were only talking to each other.

716
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,152
Did you get caught tailing him?

717
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,904
Why can't you understand?

718
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,406
He knew that we were tailing him,
from the start.

719
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,658
So you don't know where he's going?

720
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,036
Okay. Just stand by.

721
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,372
If Gi wanted us to follow him...

722
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,716
Don't mind him. Our target is Kim Woo-gi.

723
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,137
I need to take a leak.
Is the rest stop close?

724
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,530
Something in there?

725
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,368
I found a monitoring system
inside your phone.

726
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,329
God, damn it, Gi Tae-ung!

727
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,874
Can we reverse trace it by remote?

728
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,752
Chamber 9 will be able to do it.

729
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,838
Tell them that we need Gi's location
as soon as possible.

730
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,756
Yes, sir.

731
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:24,886
That cunning bastard.
He's making this harder than it should be.

732
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,596
Wait for now.

733
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,486
It's Chamber 9.

734
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,198
Where's Gi Tae-ung?

735
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,076
He's at Incheon Container Terminal No.1.

736
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,955
So it was Incheon, not Gwangyang.

737
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,125
You, take my phone and go to Gwangyang.

738
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,877
The rest, to Incheon. Hurry up!

739
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,931
Hello, sir.

740
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,976
Chief.

741
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,519
Nice work, you guys.

742
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,896
-What about Min?
-Here...

743
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,275
He's driving his merry way
into Gwangyang, sir.

744
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,485
Has the ship arrived?

745
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,572
It takes an hour to drop the container
and finish the paperwork.

746
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,595
Take your hands off.
What do you think you are grabbing?

747
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,327
Gosh, hey.

748
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,581
Get your hands off!

749
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,545
You like this, don't you?
Get off me, already!

750
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,881
My gosh. My goodness.

751
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,936
Thank you.

752
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,546
Mr. Gi!

753
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,381
Good job.

754
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,550
That prick...

755
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,887
Well done.

756
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,689
We can get to court in time,
if we move right now.

757
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,815
Let's go.

758
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,115
Get in!

759
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,089
-Go Hae-ri.
-Give it to me.

760
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,716
-Hey!
-Hey!

761
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,475
Assholes! I'm going to kill them all!

762
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,250
Kill them!

763
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,682
