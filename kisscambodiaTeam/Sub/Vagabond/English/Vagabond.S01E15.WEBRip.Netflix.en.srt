00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,537
HAEDONG PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

2
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,664
GATE
KEEP LOCKED

3
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,584
Call my lawyer, I beg you! No!

4
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,668
You. Step back!

5
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,465
-Who's the one I talked with?
-It was me. What's going on here?

6
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,718
Kim Woo-gi has disappeared.

7
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,970
-What?
-What are you talking about?

8
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,389
He was kidnapped.

9
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,266
-Kidnapped?
-Yes.

10
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,855
DO NOT ENTER

11
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,449
Goodness.

12
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,129
Where's Kim's supervisor right now?

13
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,590
He was badly injured
and moved to a hospital.

14
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,051
Let me check the CCTVs.

15
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,637
Actually...

16
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,723
The CCTVs are broken.

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,142
What?

18
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,900
Call the forensics team
for fingerprints and bloodstains.

19
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,402
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,159
The guard said the culprit
had a doctor's coat and a mask,

21
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,785
so they couldn't see him.

22
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,788
Ask the police for the security videos
around the hospital.

23
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,082
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,917
Things are looking bad.

25
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,296
O Sang-mi has vanished.
And now, Kim's kidnapped.

26
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,132
We must find them before they get killed.

27
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,558
O Sang-mi!

28
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,518
Can you hear me, O Sang-mi?

29
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,939
It's been a while, Cha Dal-geon.

30
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,865
You son of a bitch...

31
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,646
Are you okay?

32
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,584
O Sang-mi!

33
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,266
O Sang-mi...

34
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,770
Damn it.

35
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,815
I'll call the ambulance. Stay with me.

36
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,986
Talk to me.

37
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,209
What is that?

38
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,337
Huh? O Sang-mi!

39
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,424
Sa...

40
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,094
Ma...

41
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,930
El...

42
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,601
"Samael"? What is Samael?

43
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,020
Is it Hong Sun-jo?

44
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,273
O Sang-mi. O Sang-mi!

45
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,923
Don't move!

46
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,431
GOJAN POLICE STATION

47
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,685
Man, you're killing me.
I told you everything!

48
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,770
What more do you want?

49
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,691
I want you to tell me
what O Sang-mi said before she died.

50
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,735
And I'm telling you several times
that she said nothing!

51
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,195
Why are you asking me that?

52
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,990
Your fingerprint, please.

53
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,911
Detective.

54
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,080
I was the one who called this in.

55
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,332
Do you think I killed her?

56
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,961
Just do as I tell you, damn it.
I need it for reference.

57
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,131
Index finger.

58
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,724
Well, well. A record for violence?

59
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,976
Yeah, I got fined for that. Why?

60
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,811
Is that a problem?

61
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,106
-Dal-geon.
-There he is.

62
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,274
Who are you?

63
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,528
Well... We're from the NIS.

64
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,197
The NIS?

65
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,865
Why are you here?

66
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,910
We're in charge of this case.
Mr. Cha is coming with us.

67
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,411
Let's go.

68
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,706
-Wait up--
-Here, keep this.

69
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,250
If you have issues,
report through the proper channels.

70
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,835
-Thank you.
-Excuse me!

71
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,664
What about the NIS?

72
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,333
Their security is tight.
It's hard to hack into it.

73
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,627
Is that what you would say to Samael?

74
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,172
I apologize. I'll do my best, sir.

75
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,889
Did you get the photo?

76
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,060
That's what O Sang-mi drew on the floor,
right before she died.

77
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,645
What?

78
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,522
That detective was acting weird.

79
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,985
-Did you talk about anything else?
-No.

80
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,319
Yes, sir.

81
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,991
That was Chief Gang.
He wants Mr. Cha under protection.

82
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,867
No, I'm fine. I don't need that.

83
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,160
For god's sake...

84
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,246
Did you see what happened to O?

85
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,373
You might become the next target.

86
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,708
Stay with me.

87
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,336
That's protecting you, not me.

88
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,718
Hop on.

89
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,929
Have you seen that before?

90
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,599
No, I haven't.

91
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,060
The fact that O Sang-mi said "Samael",
right before she died,

92
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,979
means that there is another person,

93
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,481
other than Hong and the President.

94
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,694
That nickname, "Samael".
It's a devil incarnate from the Bible.

95
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,822
Who could possibly be fitting
to such a creepy nickname?

96
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,574
Let's clear this up.

97
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,744
The one who revealed
the President's involvement in the crash.

98
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,787
That was Prime Minister Hong.

99
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,082
The one who released O Sang-mi.
That was Hong, too.

100
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,377
If someone else is in the picture,
what does that mean?

101
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:33,299
You are suggesting
that someone else had dropped the plane,

102
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,885
and that someone used Jessica
and the President, right?

103
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,180
Hold up. That would mean...

104
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,057
the Samael guy

105
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,351
and Prime Minister Hong
are on the same boat!

106
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,979
Although it's just a theory,
I believe it's plausible enough.

107
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,065
I agree with Mr. Gi.

108
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,691
Me, too.

109
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,070
Did you dig up anything
from the CCTVs near the hospital?

110
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,156
I'm looking into it right now,
but nothing's come up, so far.

111
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,496
We don't have enough clues.
That symbol makes no sense, either.

112
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,862
Yep, looking good. Yes, yes.

113
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,915
GOD OF WAR

114
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,935
Jerome?

115
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,899
Jerome!

116
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,110
I got it!

117
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,779
It's Jerome!

118
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,838
I didn't see it.

119
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,840
I saw absolutely nothing.

120
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,425
I swear.

121
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,470
Okay, thanks.

122
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,015
Damn it...

123
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,725
Jerome's tattoo?

124
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,644
Are you sure?

125
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,939
Yes, Dal-geon saw the tattoo
on Jerome's left collarbone.

126
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,360
Attention. Special forces.
Mercenaries. Crime gangs.

127
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,070
Search all of them,

128
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,281
and find the one that uses a symbol,
similar to that tattoo.

129
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,908
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

130
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,702
If Jerome is a mercenary,

131
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,996
there's a high chance
it's a secret unit symbol.

132
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,790
A secret unit symbol?

133
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,958
In most cases,

134
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,335
they plant a microchip
under where the tattoo is.

135
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,129
It's used for tracking

136
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,549
and identifying fellow unit members.

137
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,553
Anyway, we'll send you the data.
You two can check them.

138
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,182
This is the logo for "F-Wild",
a French mercenary group.

139
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,475
That's not it.

140
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,438
This is "Samhwabang", a new Chinese gang.

141
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,315
They are working
with multinational companies--

142
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,400
That's not it.

143
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,778
Do we have to check all of them
one by one?

144
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,991
It's inefficient,
but there are so many of them.

145
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,499
And this is an African militia.

146
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,919
Its name was... Urakasababa?

147
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,590
About before...

148
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,759
Huh? What?

149
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,970
Over there...

150
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,557
Oh, the bathroom?

151
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,684
I saw nothing, really.

152
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,353
Well, maybe I should have.

153
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,022
But you moved so quickly.

154
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,650
I didn't see anything! I swear.

155
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,253
Dal-geon.

156
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,014
Of course, I saw it.
I have the eyes of an eagle.

157
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,728
I didn't know he made a necklace
with the bullet I gave him.

158
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,982
Gosh, you're cute.

159
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,336
Yeah, I knew she had seen it.

160
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,466
I want to die right now.

161
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,159
You're the first.

162
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,331
You owe me now, Go Hae-ri.

163
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,510
Give me some water. Please...

164
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,276
Samael...

165
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,987
Please take me to Samael.

166
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,657
I think that's a bad idea.

167
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,953
Because the day you meet Samael
will be your last day.

168
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,996
You fuckers.

169
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:48,001
Then just kill me now
instead of torturing me like this!

170
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,047
That's why you should've watched
your mouth, man.

171
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,937
Well...

172
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,273
I have never seen a tattoo like this.

173
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,817
What about Samael?

174
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,737
-Samael?
-Do you know who Samael is?

175
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,198
Yeah.

176
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,367
Who is it?

177
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,785
But...

178
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,539
I'm a Buddhist, you know.

179
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,458
I suggest you read the Bible.

180
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,259
You'll be handed over
to the prosecutors tomorrow.

181
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,181
Hey. Hey, Gang!

182
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,891
Let me off the hook.

183
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,644
I've thought hard about it,
and you're the only one who can save me.

184
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,481
-Take them off.
-You know my wife and kids, right?

185
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,527
You came to my housewarming party
and gave pocket money to my kids.

186
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,196
They go to college now, man!

187
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,822
I said, take them off!

188
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,327
Gang, I'm begging you. Huh?

189
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,456
My wife can't do anything without me.
Do you understand?

190
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,626
I have a wife and three daughters.

191
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,003
What do you think would happen,

192
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,673
if I go to jail, huh?

193
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,051
Come on, help me out, Ju-cheol!

194
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,929
Ju-cheol, just this once!

195
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,932
I'm begging you. Please help me!

196
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,398
O SANG-MI, LEADER OF THE BEREAVED
OF B357 CRASH, FOUND DEAD.

197
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,443
POLICE BELIEVE PERSONAL GRUDGE
MIGHT BE THE CAUSE.

198
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,828
You have a visitor, 4527.

199
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,835
So...

200
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,465
Samael is the one who screwed me over.

201
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,551
No, not exactly.

202
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,931
Samael offered the screwdriver,
but you're the one who took it.

203
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,978
-Give me your phone.
-What?

204
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,273
You're here to ask for my help, right?

205
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,744
So this is the psych hospital

206
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:32,457
and six cars went past this road between
five and six in the morning, right?

207
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,712
Yeah. But only two regular cars if you
don't count the trucks and army vehicle.

208
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,215
-Write down their license plates.
-You do it.

209
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,175
Just do it, god damn it.

210
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,690
It's me.

211
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,570
How amazing.

212
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,364
You're using a phone
inside the prison walls, now.

213
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,991
Got the picture?

214
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,576
What is it?

215
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,204
Samael? Doesn't ring any bells.

216
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,582
Ask Kim Do-su.

217
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,418
Do you think the idiot would know
something I don't?

218
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,130
Hey, do you know Samael?

219
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,092
So, what about Samael?

220
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,641
That's complicated, kind of like riddles.

221
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,226
I'll look into it.

222
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,353
Have you found Kim Woo-gi?

223
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,108
Contact Yang
in the Police Intelligence Division.

224
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,818
He'll help.

225
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,989
Hey, Jess. Aren't you taking advantage
of me a bit too much?

226
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,658
That account you gave me
literally had nothing--

227
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,956
Okay, calm down.

228
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,710
I'll expect to get paid later.

229
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,637
These kids have skills.
They will find something out.

230
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,520
The ruling party has decided
to dismiss the prime minister,

231
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,689
but the opposition party is calling
for the President's impeachment.

232
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,734
Even now, protesters for
and against the impeachment

233
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,654
are quarreling with each other
around the city,

234
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,739
but the government has not yet spoken--

235
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,745
Don't be too nervous. It'll work out.

236
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,165
Let's go.

237
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,963
DO NOT ENTER

238
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,860
If the sitting President had to step down,

239
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,695
who'd benefit from it the most?

240
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,447
Can I see the President?

241
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:11,992
What for?

242
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,541
Chief Gang knows someone
in the Blue House. I'll ask him.

243
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,600
Are we skipping "hello" now?

244
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,529
Why did you call me?

245
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,534
There will soon be a motion
to dismiss you as prime minister.

246
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:59,164
I suggest you take the easy way
and walk yourself out.

247
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,671
I suggest you step down
before you get thrown out.

248
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,257
Step down?

249
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:14,054
That seems like the least you could do
for the good people of Korea.

250
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,642
I took a pen-swinging editor-in-chief
that you were

251
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,810
and made you a prime minister--

252
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,397
Thanks to you,
I was given so many nicknames.

253
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,775
"The Puppet Minister."

254
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,610
"The Invisible Man."

255
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,570
"The Backseat Guy."

256
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,280
"The Unemployed."

257
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,784
Did that bother you?

258
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,871
If you had told me
about your political desire,

259
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,998
of course I would've supported you.

260
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,669
No, you would have fired me
a long time ago.

261
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,257
Because you hate competitors, right?

262
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,969
What is the actual reason
behind this revolt?

263
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,431
Snakes die

264
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,686
if they don't shed their skin.

265
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,108
I simply shed my skin
because the time came.

266
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,861
Even if you get dismissed,

267
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,116
the people of this country
will never forgive you.

268
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,328
Oh, come now, brother.

269
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,334
Being thrown out and stepping down
might seem the same.

270
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,005
But your sentencing depends
on what you choose.

271
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,343
So please make a wise decision.

272
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,060
Venomous son of a bitch.

273
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,198
Cha Dal-geon has requested
to meet you, sir.

274
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,452
I have no time to meet with
the likes of him right now.

275
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm going to see Yun Han-gi.
Get the car ready, quietly.

276
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,541
Yes, sir.

277
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,297
Yes. Okay, Chief.

278
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,178
Your request was denied.

279
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,014
Let's look for another way.

280
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,099
Waiting in front of the Blue House,

281
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,018
it's not going to help.

282
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,772
POLICE

283
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,276
Hey, isn't that the President?

284
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,738
Oh, I think it is.

285
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,955
Who the hell is that idiot?

286
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,292
Stay in the car, sir.

287
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,462
Mr. President! Mr. President!

288
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,757
-You bastard!
-Sir--

289
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,218
-You have to talk to me!
-Don't shoot!

290
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,012
He's a victim of the B357 crash.

291
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,392
Get off! Mr. President!
We need to talk!

292
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,521
Don't you think
this is way over the line, Mr. Cha?

293
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,731
Did you ever think that you were set up?

294
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,362
What if someone is using you?

295
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,660
We're blocking the road.

296
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,955
Let's go somewhere more quiet.

297
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,876
I've never once considered that.

298
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,171
Do you think that I was set up

299
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,924
by Hong Sun-jo?

300
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,593
Yes.

301
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,686
-Any proof?
-That's why I wanted to meet you.

302
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,354
What do you mean?

303
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,692
I want to know how deeply involved he is
in all of this.

304
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,612
Tell me how he helped you,

305
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,573
what he has on you--

306
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,074
Look here, Mr. Cha--

307
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,035
I'm asking if Prime Minister Hong
is an accomplice.

308
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,663
What are you trying to get at?

309
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,961
I know I failed at finding out the truth,

310
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,173
but my fault stops there.

311
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,010
I'm one of the wronged, too.

312
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,638
You were wronged?

313
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,974
Yes, I was.

314
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,978
What did I do wrong to deserve--

315
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,229
You...

316
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,274
lied to your people!

317
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,823
You used your title as President
to bury the truth.

318
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,576
Is that any different
from crashing the plane?

319
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,373
I'm the man who makes choices
and decisions.

320
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,504
I stop things for the majority's sake,
and I hide things if they cause chaos.

321
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,591
To a president, that is the truth.

322
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,344
That's why they could control you.

323
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,889
Because you were greedy enough
to trick and fool your people!

324
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,517
What do you know?

325
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,062
Do you know politics or power?

326
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,773
How dare you talk like that
when you know nothing?

327
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,691
Look at you.

328
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,402
You don't see, you don't listen.

329
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,280
You make selfish decisions
and think everyone else is wrong!

330
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,242
This is exactly what they want from you!

331
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,369
What?

332
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:34,123
Even someone as stupid as me can see this,
so how do you not, Mr. President?

333
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,504
You're crazy.

334
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,744
Yes, I'll inform the President.

335
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,709
Secretary Yun has turned himself in
to the NIS investigation team.

336
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,836
What do you mean, turned himself in?

337
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,259
Yun Han-gi woke up?

338
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,886
Clear the path, guys.

339
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,387
-Keep them away!
-A word, please!

340
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,474
What happened?

341
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,769
What do you think
about Prime Minister Hong's claims?

342
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,564
Is Deep Blue actually
owned by the President?

343
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,190
Did you manage his slush funds?

344
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,363
I'll tell the truth

345
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,241
in front of the investigation team.

346
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,702
You heard him. No questions. Make way!

347
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,038
-Tell us something!
-Out of the way!

348
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,999
I've heard you made an account
under your mother's name.

349
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,216
That's enough. Stand up, ma'am.

350
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,509
That's enough. Make way!

351
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,394
We can have a break if you want.

352
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,982
This interrogation will be over
by the time I finish this coffee.

353
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,462
My secret account and password.

354
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,300
Everything you want is in that account.

355
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,030
Yes, sir.

356
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,785
Why the sudden change of heart?

357
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,792
The President might get impeached,

358
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,129
but you'll only be an acting president.

359
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,048
Isn't that a perfect stepping stone

360
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,426
for me to become the next president?

361
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,512
Even Putin started as an acting president.

362
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,932
Was helping Jeong become the President

363
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,435
a part of your plan, too?

364
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:47,650
Yeah, since I had no public support
to become one myself back then.

365
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,652
You might become a candidate,

366
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,031
but that doesn't mean you'll be elected.

367
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,701
Don't worry about that.

368
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,581
Do you think I started all this
without any assistance?

369
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,668
I have my own helpers.

370
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,338
Who are these helpers?

371
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,385
If you don't tell me,

372
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,763
I can't help you.

373
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,016
If you don't help me
after I tell you who they are,

374
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,310
you're dead.

375
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,271
I'll be the judge of that.

376
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,445
You know enough
about international relations,

377
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,739
so it'll be easy to understand.

378
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,576
In 1997,

379
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,205
why do you think we got hit
by the financial crisis?

380
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,541
It's called "fleecing".

381
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,045
Depriving a country
of everything they've got.

382
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:54,342
Neo-liberalism is about knocking down
barriers in money and capital markets.

383
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,652
People change their minds

384
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,029
all the time.

385
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,326
Humans are cunning creatures, you know.

386
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,788
Have you heard of Samael?

387
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,383
Do you know him?

388
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,474
Now that I've finished my coffee,

389
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,310
I'd like to go back to the hospital.

390
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,532
It's been confirmed
that John &amp; Mark approached the President

391
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,826
to win the F-X contract,

392
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:06,164
and it has been found they offered a bribe
during the process.

393
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:10,626
A total of 500 million dollars
from the contract payment

394
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,045
went through a Singaporean secret account

395
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,008
and a paper company called "Deep Blue",
to be laundered

396
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,720
and then transferred
to President Jeong Gook-pyo.

397
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,770
Do you have anything to say
to the bereaved?

398
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,480
Do you have anything to say...

399
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,065
FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF NIS
AN GI-DONG,

400
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,567
DEFENSE MINISTER
PARK MAN-YEONG ARRESTED

401
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,953
-Jeong Gook-pyo should go away!
-Go away!

402
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,415
-The dirty president should step down!
-Step down!

403
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:53,044
-The Blue House should wake up!
-Wake up!

404
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,505
-Jeong Gook-pyo should be thrown out!
-Throw him out!

405
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,009
-Jeong Gook-pyo should go away!
-Go away!

406
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,647
The citizens will win!

407
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,154
THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT
WILL BE PUT TO THE VOTE TOMORROW

408
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:30,498
From now on,
as proposed by 182 assemblymen...

409
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,624
CHAIRMAN

410
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,503
...we will take a vote for the approval
of the President's impeachment.

411
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,632
Thank you.

412
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,927
A soup
and a ham &amp; cheese sandwich, please.

413
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,138
With extra bacon and avocado.

414
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,600
Wow, since when do you know so well
about my taste?

415
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,686
It's for me.

416
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,064
It won't be rejected, right?

417
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,691
That's never going to happen.

418
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,485
I've heard a lot of them
are against the impeachment.

419
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,946
Stop making me anxious, guys.

420
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,948
Wait, turn the volume up.

421
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,616
I think it's finished.

422
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,244
I will now declare the results.

423
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,830
He's announcing it!

424
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,918
Out of 299 votes,

425
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,798
in favor of impeachment - 247 votes,

426
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,467
against - 43 votes,

427
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,512
and six abstained
and there were three spoilt votes.

428
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,516
I hereby announce
that the request for the impeachment

429
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,645
of President Jeong Gook-pyo is approved.

430
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,067
We did it.

431
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,780
-Good work.
-Great job.

432
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,616
Shouldn't we go
to Gwanghamun Square tonight?

433
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,743
Let's go!

434
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,459
We won.

435
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,634
Are you going outside?

436
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,679
I just need some air.

437
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,807
-We'll get ready, sir.
-No need for that.

438
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,644
-Just give me the car keys.
-No, sir. We'll take you there.

439
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,273
Are you looking down on me now, too?

440
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,817
Mr. President.

441
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,695
Just give me the keys.

442
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,815
God, damn it.

443
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,614
Did you ever think that you were set up?

444
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,493
What if someone is using you?

445
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,216
Yes, Kim.

446
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,679
Do you have Cha Dal-geon's phone number?

447
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,896
MUDDY, UNPAVED, UNEVEN ROAD

448
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,510
The thing called power,

449
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,681
it makes a man go berserk,
just like drugs do.

450
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,811
You can never share it with someone else.

451
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,522
You want it for yourself.

452
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,527
You want more of it.
That's how you lose your composure.

453
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,198
Why did you want to see me?

454
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,662
To be honest,
I was thinking about killing myself.

455
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:45,002
But to think
that I had been set up as you said,

456
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,964
I got so angry that I couldn't die.

457
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,057
If you're going to fight until the end

458
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,269
with the ones who made me like this,
the ones who crashed the plane,

459
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,189
I will help you.

460
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,193
The impeachment will lead you to prison.

461
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:13,155
If a lion gets trapped in a zoo,
does it become a cat?

462
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,953
How could you possibly help us?

463
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,789
I will do everything I can.

464
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,502
What a shame.

465
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,837
I wish you helped me earlier.

466
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,173
No time for regrets.

467
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,759
It's always too late to regret
what you've done.

468
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,344
I don't need your help.

469
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,263
I'll take care of myself.

470
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:42,434
You were the first person to give me
a meaningful piece of advice.

471
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,524
Save my number.

472
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,278
And call me when you need help.

473
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,675
It's our new addition. Try it. It's good.

474
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,678
Yes. Thank you.

475
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,932
It is good. Try some.
You said you were hungry.

476
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,477
Where is he?

477
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,148
Um...

478
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,650
Is master Gye inside?

479
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,527
"Master Gye", my ass.

480
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:38,032
Anyway, he stayed up all night
trying to find that terrorist.

481
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,033
TTOBONG'S CHICKEN

482
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,200
Come in.

483
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,037
Where did he go?

484
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,664
He was right here.

485
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,917
What a mess.

486
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:52,921
Is that him?

487
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,674
Yeah, you should see him
on the keyboard.

488
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,093
You have no idea how fast his fingers are!

489
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,763
He has Savant syndrome.

490
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,222
An absolute genius.

491
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,351
He must be so exhausted,
working day and night.

492
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,687
And all he ever eats is chicken.

493
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,943
-He found Jerome!
-What? Really?

494
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,572
Mister, wake up right now.

495
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,823
Come on!

496
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,368
Is this all you have on him?

497
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,703
I didn't steal any chicken.

498
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,748
-What?
-I'm sorry, mom.

499
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,543
Who are you calling mom?
What's wrong with you? Go away!

500
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,880
SPECIAL AGENT

501
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,465
Hae-ri Go.

502
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,634
We've found who Jerome is.

503
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,261
He is in an American mercenary company
called "Black Sun".

504
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,139
That woman who introduced Jerome
to Michael

505
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,100
must be one of them, too.

506
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,477
Send me the address. I'll head over there.

507
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,276
MR. EDWARD

508
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,737
Mr. Cha? This is Edward.

509
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,447
Great timing.

510
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,574
Do you know much
about mercenary companies?

511
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,285
Of course, I do. I sell weapons.

512
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,912
Do you know about "Black Sun"?

513
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,917
Black Sun...

514
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,797
It's a mercenary company
in North Carolina, USA.

515
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,257
Why do you ask?

516
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,051
The airplane terrorist is one of them.

517
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,469
Is that so?

518
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,680
That's big news.

519
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,765
We should meet.

520
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,061
I'm at my office. Can you come here?

521
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,855
I'll be right there.

522
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,669
REPORTER JO'S WIFE

523
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,505
Hello? This is Cha Dal-geon.

524
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,633
I got the text you had sent.

525
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,804
You said my husband's cause of death
might not be the sudden acceleration.

526
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,515
Yes, that's right.

527
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:13,562
Did you experience anything weird
before the accident?

528
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,483
I have no idea about what happened.

529
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,985
July 24th was our anniversary,

530
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,988
so my husband rented that car
to take me for a drive.

531
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,406
Hold up.

532
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,451
Did you say July 24th?

533
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,495
Yes.

534
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,915
The accident happened
when he was coming to pick me up.

535
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,589
Dal-geon.

536
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,384
I saw the fake Jo Bu-yeong,

537
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,472
on July 23rd,
after Hoon's memorial ceremony.

538
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,641
Hello?

539
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,267
I can't hear you.

540
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,311
Oh, I'm sorry.

541
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,064
I'll call you back.

542
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,941
Thanks for calling me.

543
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,943
Yes.

544
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,034
Let me look into Reporter Jo.

545
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,120
You can contact me whenever you need help.

546
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,206
-See you.
-Yes.

547
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,336
The day after he told me
he would look into him,

548
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,338
the real Jo Bu-yeong died.

549
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,590
Could it be that...

550
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,511
MR. EDWARD

551
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,140
Yes.

552
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,684
Where are you?

553
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,229
I'm in the parking lot.

554
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,147
I'm going up now.

555
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,416
He's waiting for you.

556
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,353
I'm Micky.

557
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,147
I believe you know me.

558
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:24,818
She was Asian.

559
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,863
I met Michael through his girlfriend.

560
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,364
That woman...

561
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,492
was the one
who introduced Jerome to Michael.

562
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,621
Her face.

563
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,289
Did you see her face?

564
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,008
In most cases, they plant a microchip
under where the tattoo is.

565
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:53,055
It's used for tracking
and identifying fellow unit members.

566
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,903
Mr. Cha is here.

567
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,988
Oh, Mr. Cha.

568
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,239
Have a seat.

569
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,742
-Bring us some tea.
-Yes, sir.

570
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,171
If the terrorist is in Black Sun,

571
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,007
I think I can find out about it.

572
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,469
Can you tell me where you got the intel?

573
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,850
-From O Sang-mi.
-O Sang-mi?

574
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,024
This is Darjeeling tea
from the Indian Himalayas.

575
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,527
Thank you. Oops.

576
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,030
My bad. Here.

577
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,456
I'll bring a new glass.

578
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,583
Samael?

579
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,868
He's quite useful.
Don't kill him.

580
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,959
Samael has given you a last chance.

581
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,961
It's you.

582
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,714
You're Michael's girlfriend.

583
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,468
What are you talking about?

584
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,720
Should I say the same thing
to Cha Dal-geon

585
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,263
and see how he reacts?

586
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,517
Call your boss right now.

587
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,186
Do you want to make a deal?

588
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,022
I'll testify that John &amp; Mark
is behind the attack.

589
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,525
Twenty billion won seems like a good deal.

590
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,568
One more thing.

591
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,280
Less than three years in prison.
You can do it, right?

592
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,450
I know your organization has the power.

593
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,204
I have nothing to lose now.

594
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,624
Choose wisely.

595
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,085
Great Samael.

596
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,818
Did you hear anything else
from O Sang-mi?

597
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,779
Samael.

598
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,786
That's what she said.

599
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,540
Samael...

600
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,459
Do you know that bastard?

601
00:52:55,797 --> 00:53:00,468
I happen to have some data on Samael.

602
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,236
They say...

603
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,447
that he's a ghost.

604
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,656
I hope

605
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,411
that this piece of data could help you
find the real terrorist.

606
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,502
Was it you?

607
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,212
Did you kill Hoon?

608
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,051
Such a pity.

609
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,637
I really liked you.

610
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,805
I...

611
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,934
I can't protect you anymore.

612
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,268
Protect me?

613
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,687
Cut the bullshit. You didn't protect me!

614
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,814
You would've died in Morocco,
if it weren't for me.

615
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,910
So...

616
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,706
You saved me so you could use me?

617
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,501
Because people listen
to what the victims say.

618
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:19,089
You should've stopped
when you caught Kim Woo-gi.

619
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,009
If you had,
all of us would've been happy.

620
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,886
You are a devil.

621
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,179
Devil?

622
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,057
That's what Samael is.

623
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,767
Cha Dal-geon.

624
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:36,231
Do you think I planned all this,
just to win a fighter jet contract?

625
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,650
What are you saying?

626
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,444
Don't move!

627
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,947
You don't know how this world works.

628
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:49,160
Do you know why
we can never get rid of crimes?

629
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,082
To make money,

630
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,460
we need crimes to change the law.

631
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,753
Shut up, asshole.

632
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,213
The world of crimes,

633
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,799
it's an industry created
by those who rule the law.

634
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,343
The same goes for war and terrorism.

635
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,637
With that money,

636
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,265
we try to make this world
a more comfortable place.

637
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,351
I yearn for the day

638
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:17,063
that my motherland becomes
a prosperous nation.

639
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,024
A strong nation,

640
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:22,986
where its people can brag
to the rest of the world!

641
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,071
To me, that's justice.

642
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,369
People making a living
for their families to just get by,

643
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,704
that's not justice.

644
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,124
Hey.

645
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,085
You killed innocent people.

646
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,171
Do you call that justice?

647
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,757
Death is the most common thing on earth.

648
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,469
When my justice is realized in this world,

649
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:51,181
your nephew's death
will be more holy and noble

650
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,183
than those petty survivors--

651
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,855
I don't care about justice.

652
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,274
You messed up.

653
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,236
Harming my nephew, that was your mistake.

654
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,863
You can kill me,

655
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,949
but the cartwheel will never stop.

656
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,286
There are plenty of people
who will stand in my place.

657
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,081
What are you?

658
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,542
Who the hell are you guys?

659
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:21,836
Us?

660
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,514
Don't be stupid. Back off.

661
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,433
It's ready, sir.

662
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,028
I invited a guest to that place.

663
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,117
Oh, she arrived.

664
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,957
If I'm not wrong,

665
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,793
there's a bomb in that bag.

666
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,757
Put the gun away,

667
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,301
or you'll witness something terrible.

668
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,387
Shut up!

669
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,256
No, no...

670
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,387
Stop it or I'll kill you!

671
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,984
Drop the gun.

672
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,195
Or else,

673
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,531
all the families and Go Hae-ri will die,

674
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,994
because of you.

675
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,455
Please stop.

676
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,001
Cha Dal-geon.

677
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,629
Their deaths will be on you.

678
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,874
We are the ones who pave paths
where no one else does.

679
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,586
To get to us,

680
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,007
you need to take on the gods, first.

681
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,343
You fucking bastard--

682
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,391
Got that?

683
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,786
SPECIAL AGENT

684
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:31,002
The person you're trying to reach...

685
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,088
For god's sake, where is he?

686
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,934
It'll go off as soon as
it receives a call.

687
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,735
It's such a shame.

688
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,696
Consider it a blessing.

689
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,658
You're now off to meet your nephew.

690
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,758
