1
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,368
Mr. President is now entering
the plenary chamber.

2
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,759
WE DON'T APPROVE OF
SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET

3
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,262
PRESIDENT JEONG GOOK-PYO'S SPEECH
ON THE SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET

4
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,192
My dear honorable citizens,

5
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,196
the Chairman of the National Assembly,
and all assemblymen.

6
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,824
For the last 10 years or so

7
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,994
as I've been working
in parliamentary politics,

8
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,663
sometimes I agonized

9
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:07,252
and sometimes I suffered
while representing the will of the nation.

10
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,755
I'm honored to be here
at the National Assembly,

11
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,049
the symbol of representative democracy,

12
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,470
to explain why we need
the supplementary budget

13
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,015
and how we are going to use it.

14
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,521
Why are you doing this to us?

15
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,777
-It's the order from our country.
-The country, my ass!

16
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,238
It's from John &amp; Mark!

17
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,992
They all are Korean citizens,

18
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,412
and we're civil servants to serve them.

19
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,709
Please tell them to drop their weapons!

20
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,298
Sir.

21
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,641
We're following the orders.
What the fuck are you doing? Shoot them!

22
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,061
Oh, no!

23
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,938
Don't kill me!

24
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,691
I'll do whatever you want.
Please don't kill me!

25
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,986
Get down!

26
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,954
The Republic of Korea
belongs to its citizens.

27
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,374
As the President
who defends the democratic constitution,

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,213
I believe
serving the citizens and giving them hope

29
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,634
are the best politics.

30
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,928
Hold your fire!

31
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,262
Night visions!

32
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,773
I got shot on my bulletproof vest.

33
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,070
Where did they go?

34
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,697
I think they went downstairs.

35
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,033
Let's go.

36
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,800
Good, you're here.

37
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,093
Get inside!

38
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,938
Get in!

39
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,432
We're here.

40
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,145
It's too dangerous here.
We can't hold that much longer.

41
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,521
You must.

42
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,398
There's no other way--

43
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,358
Hello? Hello!

44
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,860
Who was it?

45
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,780
Edward Park's secretary.

46
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,323
Edward?

47
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,412
-Blow it up.
-Yes, sir.

48
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,795
Is that even possible?

49
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,799
I don't know,
but we need to trust her for now.

50
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,510
Give me that.

51
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,223
Sir, you've got to look at this!

52
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,445
Get back!

53
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,155
Get down!

54
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,907
Two, one!

55
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,875
Take it!

56
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,910
Any ammo to share?

57
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,705
Damn it.

58
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,956
This is the last round.

59
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,668
How many minutes left?

60
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,921
Shit.

61
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,467
Let's head in.

62
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,320
Hae-ri, out of my way.

63
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,203
We're all going to die.

64
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,829
Don't fucking say that.

65
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,207
All that fucking commotion for nothing.

66
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,168
Shut the fuck up.

67
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,705
Hey!

68
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,753
Wait a second!

69
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,174
Damn it.

70
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,884
You know what?

71
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,220
There's a bomb right here.

72
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,432
If I don't stop the timer,

73
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,142
everything will be blown to pieces.

74
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,695
You think it's funny, huh?

75
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,197
We're not hiding here for the fear of you.

76
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,242
Be wise.

77
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,078
Don't be fucking stupid, or we'll all die.

78
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,832
Oh my, 30 seconds left.

79
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,209
So what's it going to be?
Stopping the bomb or not?

80
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,795
Stop fucking bullshitting me.

81
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,965
Whether it's bullshit or not,

82
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,217
we'll know in 20 seconds.

83
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,847
What the heck is he doing?

84
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,348
He's stalling.

85
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,811
Time is almost up. Ten seconds.

86
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,771
Nine.

87
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,232
Eight!

88
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,819
You fucking idiots still don't believe me?

89
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,704
-Get down!
-Fire!

90
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,390
I think I heard an explosion.

91
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:46,145
Wow, they even used a C4.
This is a full-on war now.

92
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,564
Not bad.

93
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,692
-You can tell just from the sound?
-Come on.

94
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,070
I got military training

95
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,530
in the States.

96
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,582
These corpses...

97
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,388
To complete the F-X plan
as soon as possible,

98
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,224
the budget must be

99
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,477
supplemented by one trillion won.

100
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,188
The citizens' happiness

101
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:17,903
can be ensured
when the State protects their safety.

102
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,968
The person you're trying to reach...

103
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,889
What's wrong?

104
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,724
Is he not answering?

105
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,059
That's odd.

106
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,395
They should be done by now.

107
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,747
Fucking traitor.

108
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:15,044
Gi Tae-ung, fucking son of a bitch!

109
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:37,107
The F-X plan shows the State's strong will
to take care of

110
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,527
the lives of our citizens

111
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,448
and the national mission
of taking ownership of our future.

112
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,374
As the President of this country,

113
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,043
no matter what it costs,

114
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,879
on our citizens' happiness

115
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,881
and on their safety

116
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,758
I can never,

117
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,136
ever back down.

118
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,722
We're all okay.

119
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,140
Where should we go now?

120
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,309
PRESIDENT

121
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,435
Yes.

122
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,356
Okay.

123
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,529
Shit! Stop!

124
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,697
See you there.

125
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,783
Let's go. Stop, Kim Woo-gi!

126
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,868
Let's go, sir.

127
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:34,331
-You must bring Kim back home alive.
-Aren't you coming with us?

128
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,417
I also got the order

129
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,501
to kill you guys.

130
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,672
Then Hwang wasn't lying.

131
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,800
-The one who ordered to kill us was--
-Director An.

132
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,391
But why?

133
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,270
There's only one place in Korea
that has control over the NIS.

134
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,192
Hae-ri Go, come on!

135
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,945
Memorize this.

136
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,114
070-1584-1779.

137
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,407
Codename "Vagabond".

138
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,326
Hang on a second.

139
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,203
If the government is in on it,

140
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,665
then this is beyond my ability.

141
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,835
-You know I'm not capable--
-I know you're not.

142
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,547
I wish it weren't you. However,

143
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,468
now you're the only one
I can entrust this grave task.

144
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,222
-070--
-070-1584-1779.

145
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,223
Codename "Vagabond".

146
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,186
Call that number before you return.

147
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,938
I can't stall much longer. Go now.

148
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,826
What are we supposed to do now?

149
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,287
We didn't kill them.

150
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,124
We were just lucky survivors.

151
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,251
Delete the CCTV footage.

152
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,297
Okay. I understand what you mean.

153
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,265
Hae-ri Go!

154
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,145
Where's Gi?

155
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,356
He's cleaning up the situation.

156
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,358
Follow me but be careful.

157
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,656
Careful.

158
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,783
-Walk faster, moron!
-It hurts.

159
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,614
I'm glad you guys made it.

160
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,869
Discard your phones.
You can be tracked down.

161
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,311
President Jeong Gook-pyo stressed
the supplementary budget

162
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,230
is an emergency plan
for the citizens' safety

163
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,733
and a precautionary plan for the happiness

164
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,027
in the future of Korea.

165
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,531
The ruling and opposition parties
had distinctively different reactions.

166
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,951
The ruling party emphasized
the necessity of the budget,

167
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,369
while the oppositions demanded

168
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,955
an inquiry into the truth
of the B357 crash

169
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,042
and explanation
about the dubious selection

170
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,796
-of the F-X plan partner.
-The dog barks, yet the train still runs.

171
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,138
How did you like my speech
at the National Assembly?

172
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,808
The budget will be in our hands for sure.

173
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,559
And based on what I saw today,

174
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,145
there's no need to worry
about being a lame duck.

175
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,231
It's too soon to become a lame duck.

176
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,817
Even my pee stream is as strong as a bull.

177
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,614
If you know some good health supplements
share some with me.

178
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,909
Power is the best medicine to rejuvenate.

179
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,036
Even after my term is over,

180
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,956
I need to be as vigorous as now,

181
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,792
which is why I can't relax these days.

182
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,920
Of all time,

183
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,299
I am probably
the most hard-working president, ever.

184
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,760
The public opinion
is better than expected.

185
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,179
Because he's such a good actor.

186
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,313
Jerk.

187
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,111
What the hell are you talking about?

188
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,822
A hole in the embassy floor?
That's ridiculous!

189
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,908
I sent the pictures of the site.
Take a look.

190
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,827
We have received them.

191
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,203
On the screen.

192
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,509
By the way...

193
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,303
How come you're not dead?

194
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,013
I was lucky.

195
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,016
I'll brief you on the details
back in Korea.

196
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,350
Gi Tae-ung,

197
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,519
I wonder if you let them escape.

198
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,691
If I could make a hole in the floor,
I wouldn't have asked for backup.

199
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,319
You got CCTVs there, right?
Send me the footage.

200
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,615
Mr. Hwang's team messed with them,
so there's no footage left.

201
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,075
Shit, this is driving me fucking nuts.

202
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,660
Clean up the mess and come back.

203
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,078
Yes, sir.

204
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,211
When Gi Tae-ung wanted to go there,

205
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,213
you should've just said no...

206
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,715
What?

207
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,052
Are you saying this is all my fault?

208
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,637
No, sir.

209
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,347
You handpicked the backup!

210
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,933
It's you who didn't send smarter ones!

211
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,643
My apologies, sir.

212
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,939
Good day, sir.

213
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,613
Why aren't you working?

214
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,033
Request Interpol to put those bastards
on their red notice list

215
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,994
and ask intelligence services worldwide
for their cooperation.

216
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,497
Have them comb through

217
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,625
all the airports and ports
in Morocco and bordering countries.

218
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,630
Do it already for fuck's sake!
Do something, damn it!

219
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,090
-Yes, sir.
-You got it.

220
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,520
Chief Presidential Secretary has called
an emergency secretary meeting at 4 p.m.

221
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,772
Tell him I can't go
because I have an appointment.

222
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,858
He wants every chief to be there.

223
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,823
Just tell him

224
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,283
that I can't go.

225
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,411
Yes, sir.

226
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,965
Go ahead.

227
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,467
We lost Kim Woo-gi.

228
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,472
Yun, are you there?

229
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,849
Who took him?

230
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,853
I have a hunch.
I'll check first and get back to you.

231
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,230
Shit.

232
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,072
Where is Kim Woo-gi now?

233
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,742
Why? Did he escape?

234
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,910
Don't play dumb! I know it was you!

235
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,621
You had Gi Tae-ung hide him away.

236
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,334
With Yun Han-gi gone,
you'll be as good as dog shit.

237
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,752
I'm going to kill you!

238
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,590
Fuck! You bastard!

239
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,052
Don't move!

240
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,021
Pull that fucking trigger.

241
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,647
You think I fucking can't?

242
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,399
How many times have you shot?

243
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,611
Have you ever risked your life
for a mission?

244
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,030
You've climbed up the ladder
with your fucking mouth

245
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,325
by cleaning up after politicians
and flattering your bosses.

246
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,913
Scumbags like you
have turned the NIS into this shit.

247
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,124
There are no competent agents left,

248
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,502
but only fucking errand boys
for the Blue House!

249
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,670
Son of a bitch.

250
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,840
I'll kill you, motherfucker.

251
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,177
Fuck!

252
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,312
-Gi-su.
-Yes, sir.

253
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,857
I need you to handle an important task.

254
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,657
Put that

255
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,328
in Gang's meal and make sure he eats it.

256
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,247
What is it?

257
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,331
Nothing.

258
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,044
He'll just have a seizure
and then a fatal heart attack.

259
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,048
We can't have an autopsy.

260
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,802
He has no family anyway,
so just sign him out

261
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,054
for cremation.

262
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,807
I've looked into everything suspicious.

263
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,226
-Gang has nothing--
-His very existence...

264
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:01,731
is causing such a nuisance to us.

265
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,652
Unless we nip him in the bud,

266
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,446
he'll cause big trouble.

267
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,754
I sent personal information
of a security risk.

268
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,800
-We need to check these one more time.
-Yes, ma'am.

269
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,677
Goodness. We got a fax.

270
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,483
We got replies.

271
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,987
-What about Chief Gang's lunch?
-Excuse me?

272
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,281
I'm not really sure.

273
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,617
Order sundaetguk from there
and bring it to him.

274
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,827
You got it.

275
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,381
Let me. Thank you.

276
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,805
I'm sorry. Give that to me.

277
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:19,059
Let me take it. It's not heavy at all.

278
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,103
Wow, it smells good.

279
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,363
Sir!

280
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,284
Sorry for the late lunch. Here you go.

281
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,162
Are you in charge of my meals today?

282
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,122
Shall I keep being on it?

283
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm sick of stew.
Get me jajangmyeon for dinner.

284
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,213
Sure thing. Enjoy before it gets cold.

285
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,771
Oh, my God. I don't understand!

286
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,441
Goodness. This way! Here! Over here!

287
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,736
Mr. Gang!

288
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,070
119
PARAMEDIC

289
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,241
Sir, please wake up!

290
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,161
Oh, my God!

291
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,412
Out of the way, please!

292
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,421
I can't believe this. Sir, please.

293
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,717
Charge to 200 joules. Shock!

294
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,680
Charge to 200 joules. Shock!

295
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,064
Sir!

296
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,664
Time of death, 15:11, September 16th.

297
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,250
Mr. Gang Ju-cheol has passed away.

298
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,384
No! Sir!

299
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,846
Please open your eyes!

300
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,473
Get off me!

301
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,892
Sir, please open your eyes!

302
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,686
Sir!

303
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,776
Sir!

304
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,287
NFS
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

305
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,882
-Where are you going?
-I'm not going to tell you.

306
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,719
We want to check your IDs
and your destination. It's the process.

307
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,304
Don't make things harder.

308
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,097
What are they saying?

309
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,308
Probably checking our destination
and identifications.

310
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,368
I'll give you what you want.
I'll do whatever you want.

311
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,204
Please don't kill me!

312
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,957
I beg you, please don't kill me!

313
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,105
Don't move.

314
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,524
It hurts! It fucking hurts!

315
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,901
Douchebag!

316
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,527
Shut up.

317
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,115
Mr. Park would like to talk to you.

318
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,620
This is Cha Dal-geon.

319
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,497
I was afraid we might be too late.
I'm so relieved.

320
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,834
A cargo ship will come early this morning.

321
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,170
Take that back to Korea.

322
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,674
Please explain what's going on.

323
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,843
It'll come to you as a surprise.

324
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,220
The Korean government

325
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,641
is in on this whole thing.

326
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,603
Are you sure?

327
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,522
My source is a high ranking official
at the Blue House.

328
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,067
That's how I found out
about the situation in Morocco.

329
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,777
Fuck! Do it gently!

330
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,612
Stop being whiny for Pete's sake!

331
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,323
I don't want

332
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,700
to put your safety in jeopardy.

333
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,954
-Why don't you stop now--
-Kim Woo-gi...

334
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,832
will go to court and I'll see to it.

335
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,836
O Sang-mi lied at the press conference,

336
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,588
so our situation isn't good, either.

337
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,175
We can trust no one.
Not even the media or law enforcement.

338
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,846
This fight will be
very lonely and difficult.

339
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,344
You're making me dizzy. Please sit down.

340
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,139
Being dizzy is nothing

341
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,182
when my head is about to explode.

342
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,310
I'm telling you,
they cannot leave Morocco.

343
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,439
Every airport and port
is being thoroughly checked.

344
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,316
So there's no way they'll make it out.
Trust me.

345
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,902
I think they got out already.

346
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,072
What do you mean?

347
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,659
Ibrahim was found dead.

348
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,286
What?

349
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,330
Can you think of anyone
who might've done it?

350
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,751
It's probably Edward Park.

351
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,086
Edward?

352
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,630
That's ridiculous.

353
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,466
Come on.

354
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,593
Blowing up a floor in the embassy

355
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,970
and taking Kim Woo-gi away
undetected by the military?

356
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,015
A simple lobbyist
can't possibly pull that off.

357
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,266
If it's Edward...

358
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,602
that's more than possible.

359
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,439
Who's behind him?

360
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,525
I'm not sure exactly,

361
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,320
but he definitely has
a powerful network around the world

362
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,364
just as we're associated with you.

363
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,953
Request a search warrant on Dynamic.

364
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,997
I already did.

365
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:47,293
But the judge said O Sang-mi's statement
wasn't good enough evidence.

366
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:51,172
The judicial branch is also
secretly associated with Edward.

367
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,760
If there isn't enough evidence,
we should fabricate it.

368
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,430
When will Gi Tae-ung be back?

369
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,059
Maybe in a couple of hours?

370
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,562
This is the Republic of Korea.

371
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,773
As long as I'm around,

372
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,234
there is not much

373
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,569
Edward can pull off.

374
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,419
Oh, sir? Hello!

375
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,047
So, how was the trip?

376
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,466
Well, it was rough.

377
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,177
We didn't expect to see you here.

378
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,387
Well, surprise.

379
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,850
What are you doing?

380
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,851
Sir,

381
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,687
what's this about?

382
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,356
I didn't want to attract any attention,

383
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,692
but things have gotten pretty serious.

384
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,570
-Let's go.
-Sir!

385
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,079
I'm sweating in the armpit. Get off me.

386
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,124
Shoot.

387
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,585
I should've been the one who killed him.

388
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,012
WE DO WHAT NO ONE CAN DO
WHERE THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA NEEDS IT

389
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,689
SILENT DEVOTION ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF
KOREA'S PROTECTION AND GLORY

390
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,150
JOIN THE NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

391
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,862
Excellent!

392
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,157
You're better than a special agent.

393
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,160
Senior Secretary Yun,
you're such a good shot.

394
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,745
One shot, one kill!

395
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,626
What would happen
if I kill this man right here?

396
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,214
It depends on how we clean up.

397
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,758
Notification of his being killed
in action would suffice--

398
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,554
Jeez.

399
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,306
Where is Kim Woo-gi?

400
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,684
Ask the Director General. He's debriefed.

401
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,812
I really don't like the fact
you've come back alive.

402
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,398
I didn't join the NIS
to be liked by the Senior Secretary.

403
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,610
I can do anything
for the sake of my country.

404
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,071
On three, give me what I want.

405
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,198
Or else, you're dead.

406
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:26,827
One.

407
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,497
For freedom...

408
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,290
Two.

409
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,084
...and for the truth...

410
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,254
-Three.
-We devote ourselves--

411
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,922
Gosh!

412
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:55,231
Have him sign an NDA.
There will be a press conference tonight.

413
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,066
A press conference?

414
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,151
I'll write his script.

415
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,820
Prep him for it.

416
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,078
We can't trust him with the media.

417
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,498
He's trained.
He's not afraid of a fucking bullet.

418
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,000
After the press conference,

419
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,794
the court will have no choice
but to issue a warrant.

420
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,048
Give him his job back
and keep your eye on him.

421
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,717
If he is a traitor...

422
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,054
he must leave a trail.

423
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,931
Wow.

424
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,518
You are good.

425
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:36,022
I only have half the brain
of well-educated people like you.

426
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,107
Okay.

427
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,863
Drugs!

428
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,823
Give me some drugs!

429
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,035
Come on!

430
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,456
Drugs!

431
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,416
Give me some drugs!

432
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,626
Give me some fucking drugs!

433
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,504
I'm dying here.

434
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,006
You asshole!

435
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,551
Take that damn thing off!

436
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,178
SHOOT OUT AT THE EMBASSY IN MOROCCO

437
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,846
Come on!

438
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,306
Drugs!

439
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,351
Give me some drugs!

440
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,740
We made a hell of a mess,
but there's not a single article about it.

441
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,621
The Korean government

442
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,749
is in on this whole thing.

443
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,795
Come on, Cha Dal-geon!

444
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,255
I am dying here!

445
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,632
A painkiller or a drug.

446
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,593
Just give me anything!

447
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,345
You know what?

448
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,847
You need to get off the drug.

449
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:57,228
A Junkie's testimony
might not be admitted as evidence.

450
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:01,982
Don't you ever think
I will testify as you wish.

451
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,820
I won't do it.

452
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,988
Don't get your hopes up.

453
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,575
Just give me some drugs
before I bite my tongue to death!

454
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,077
Give me some drugs now!

455
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,578
Fucking drug!

456
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,164
What the fuck are you doing?

457
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,541
Why are you taking off your sock?

458
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,460
Drugs!

459
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,671
Give me some fucking--

460
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,173
Try biting off your tongue now!

461
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,683
You won't testify in court?

462
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,727
You'll end up doing it

463
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,773
because I'm going to make you.

464
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,918
We've got no problems so far.

465
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,213
Yes.

466
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,217
Yes, sir.

467
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,275
Why are you doing this to us?

468
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,236
An order from our country.

469
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,197
There's only one place in Korea

470
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,324
that has control over the NIS.

471
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,293
Where is Dal-geon?

472
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,297
If you let me go, I'll give you money.

473
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,216
What?

474
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,676
I have loads of it.

475
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,720
I'll give you the exact half.

476
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,598
You can have a luxurious life
for the rest of your life.

477
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,268
Now I understand why drugs are dangerous.

478
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,020
Don't you get it?

479
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,232
Those killers were from the NIS.

480
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:52,653
The entire NIS is now
in the hands of John &amp; Mark.

481
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,322
The police, the courts, and the media

482
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,324
are all taken care of by them.

483
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,869
It'll be no use
even if I confess in court!

484
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,998
So take the money--

485
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,374
Shut the fuck up!

486
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,169
Fucking nutjob!

487
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,590
I'm not afraid of people like you.

488
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,384
You're so fucked up!

489
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,851
I almost sprained my wrist.

490
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,978
How dare you try to fucking bribe me!

491
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,397
I need to cleanse my ears

492
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,566
because of all the bullshit I just heard.

493
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,694
We need to talk.

494
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,698
I also have something to tell you, too.

495
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,414
What do you want to tell me?

496
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,791
You first.

497
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,338
Don't get scared

498
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,008
and brace yourself
for what I'm about to say.

499
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:01,013
All these crazy things happening to us...

500
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,098
All of them...

501
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,897
It's okay. Go on.

502
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,817
The Korean government is involved.

503
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,989
I see you weren't ready for this.

504
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,577
Don't worry.

505
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,871
How did you find out?

506
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,207
I heard it from Edward.

507
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,045
I didn't want to shock you,

508
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,256
so I thought of not telling you, but...

509
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,970
Jeez, I'm relieved.

510
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,806
I racked my brain for nothing.

511
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,725
You knew?

512
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,310
Of course.

513
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,521
A special agent like me from the NIS

514
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,190
knows way more than an amateur like you.

515
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,407
Why don't you back out from now on?

516
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,827
What do you mean?

517
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,707
You did everything you could.

518
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,961
But fighting against the government

519
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,256
can be far more dangerous.

520
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,008
I can't believe it.

521
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,386
So, you mean I should be out,

522
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,513
but you'll keep on fighting?

523
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,807
Your paycheck comes from the government,

524
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,017
but I'm a taxpayer.

525
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,190
This is my business
and I need to take care of it

526
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,902
because my nephew was killed.

527
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,323
You're right.

528
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,659
I'm a civil servant

529
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,288
and I need to support
my mom and my brother.

530
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,793
But what if something like this
happens again?

531
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,880
Even then, because I'm a civil servant,

532
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,717
I should keep ignoring
the government's wrongdoings.

533
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,302
Is that it?

534
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,600
Hoon,

535
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,560
Hoon's friends,

536
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,021
and my dad,

537
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,440
Colonel Go Gang-cheol

538
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,027
are watching everything from above.

539
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,781
I know they are watching from heaven.

540
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,289
So how can I run away
just because I'm scared?

541
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,296
I'll make sure the whole nation
knows all about it

542
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,051
so that those assholes
can't harm anyone again.

543
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,893
Okay, high five.

544
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,189
-Out of the blue?
-Yeah.

545
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,776
Do I have to?

546
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,069
Yes, you do.

547
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,688
DYNAMIC SYSTEM-OWNED
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDING

548
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:42,818
The building you see here is
a mixed-use apartment owned by Dynamic.

549
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,863
Cha Dal-geon,
one of the bereaved in the B357 crash,

550
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,075
Go Hae-ri, a NIS agent,

551
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,453
and Edward Park,
a lobbyist working for Dynamic

552
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:58,333
have, since the crash, secretly maintained
a mutually beneficial relationship.

553
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,008
He's lying!

554
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,469
Dal-geon would never do
something like that! You know that, too!

555
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,347
People!

556
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:18,020
The NIS is lying to the whole nation!

557
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,022
Don't be fooled!

558
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,566
Why are you writing this?
You're not a real reporter!

559
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,235
-Get him out of here!
-I'm telling you, it's not true!

560
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,528
Don't be fooled!

561
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,488
Don't you touch me!

562
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,951
Oh, no!

563
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:35,912
Get off me!

564
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,666
-Stop wandering around and stay still!
-Get off me!

565
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,962
The NIS has also been bought out
by John &amp; Mark!

566
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,130
Don't be fooled!

567
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,550
Even the NIS! Get off me!

568
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:52,137
They have also been
bought out by John &amp; Mark!

569
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,221
I said, let go!

570
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,691
I'll continue briefing.

571
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,238
AGENTS KILLED
FROM EXPLOSION IN MOROCCO

572
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,283
Our agents arrested Kim Woo-gi in Morocco,

573
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,371
but these agents were killed
by an unknown explosion.

574
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,875
After that, Kim Woo-gi

575
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,212
got out of the embassy
with Cha Dal-geon and Go Hae-ri

576
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,381
and disappeared.

577
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:31,134
So, are you saying that those two
kidnapped Kim Woo-gi?

578
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,055
The chances of that...

579
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:37,808
are very high.

580
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,330
You're under arrest
for kidnapping Kim Woo-gi.

581
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,960
You're under arrest
for capturing and confining--

582
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,051
You have the right to have a lawyer
and to defend yourself.

583
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,887
You can also submit a claim
for unlawful imprisonment.

584
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,389
NIS
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

585
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,350
You are a good liar, Gi Tae-ung.

586
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,602
Let's talk at the NIS.

587
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,897
We want the truth!

588
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,441
-It's Edward!
-You evil bastard!

589
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,485
Dynamic must tell us the truth!

590
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,237
Did you find anything?

591
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,500
Go to hell!

592
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,173
-We want the truth!
-Get the fuck off me!

593
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,258
Tell us the truth!

594
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,720
The NIS investigation team

595
00:50:56,803 --> 00:51:00,140
stated that as Cha Dal-geon and Go Hae-ri
are working for Dynamic,

596
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:04,144
it's possible Kim Woo-gi is already dead.

597
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,855
So the NIS is working with Interpol.

598
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,824
Don't worry. Mr. Gi isn't a traitor.

599
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,451
How do you know?

600
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,870
If he were,
he would've killed us at the embassy.

601
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,166
Oh, wait.
Are you sure about dialing that number?

602
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,293
Yes.

603
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,672
What if he really is a traitor?

604
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,549
Don't you trust me?

605
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,178
Of course, I do.
You're the only one on my side.

606
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,305
-But still--
-Then just follow my lead.

607
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,569
Hello, this is Bullet Chicken.
We deliver faster than a bullet.

608
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,073
What?

609
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,783
A chicken place?

610
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,368
Sorry, we're closed for today.

611
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,078
No delivery now.

612
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:05,831
Vagabond!

613
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,340
Hello?

614
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,550
Vagabond?

615
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,348
Wait a moment.

616
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,200
Welcome, Go Hae-ri.

617
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,121
Who is...

618
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,498
Gang Ju-cheol?

619
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,338
How dare you call me by my name?

620
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,550
Chief!

621
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,510
Where are you?

622
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,804
We're smuggling ourselves on a ship.

623
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,639
Is Kim Woo-gi okay?

624
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,183
Yes, but what's going on?

625
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,478
It's a long story.

626
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,648
For now, give me the time and place
of your arrival.

627
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,317
On the 15th, at 9 a.m.

628
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,986
We'll be disembarking
at Incheon Container Terminal 1.

629
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,031
The container number is KHCH 35679-19.

630
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,782
15TH, 09:00, INCHEON CONTAINER TERMINAL 1
KHCH 35679-19

631
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,121
You must be bored in that cargo ship.
So how about we play a game?

632
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,206
Excuse me?

633
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,793
Min Jae-sik is desperate
to catch you guys.

634
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,379
We need to come up with a diversion.

635
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:43,136
SEONGJIN BOLT

636
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:57,275
Being a lobbyist he has such a poker face.

637
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,739
We just need him to make a single slip-up

638
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,116
to have him on a leash,

639
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,910
but he shows no emotions whatsoever.

640
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:11,206
What about the things we seized?
Anything we can use?

641
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,541
Nothing.

642
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,918
He's clean as a whistle.

643
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,836
Call Jessica in.

644
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,297
Jessica? Why her?

645
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,174
I see.

646
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,010
A lobbyist for a lobbyist?

647
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,720
Wow.

648
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,323
We're going to need some privacy.

649
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,118
Could you turn off the cameras?

650
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,962
Do you really think it's possible

651
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,880
to bring Kim Woo-gi back?

652
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,299
Because I don't.

653
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,427
You also doubted me

654
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,015
when I said I'd bring to Libya

655
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,476
an enriched uranium centrifuge.

656
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,730
It was just sheer good luck.

657
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,190
Heaven won't grant the same luck again.

658
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,109
That's why

659
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,195
I am offering that luck

660
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:25,822
to you.

661
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,784
When the trial is over,

662
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:33,538
your company will be facing criticism
from all over the world.

663
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:38,251
The NEC in the US will impose sanctions,
your stocks will hit rock bottom,

664
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,545
no one will make a deal with you,
and finally,

665
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,423
you'll go bankrupt.

666
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,176
Then John &amp; Mark will buy you out.

667
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,304
Now it starts making sense. Wow!

668
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,100
It wasn't about the F-X plan after all,

669
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,395
but it was all about
taking over Dynamic as a whole.

670
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,524
Don't jump to conclusions.
I'm just stating the facts.

671
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,110
For a mouth-watering prey like us,

672
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,362
no wonder you took the risk
of crashing that plane.

673
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,451
When we take over Dynamic,

674
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,997
you'll be the CEO.

675
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:22,003
What do you say?
Isn't this another luck sent from above?

676
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:26,341
But you want Kim Woo-gi in exchange?

677
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,597
Jessica.

678
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,066
Shut up, whore.

679
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,281
How's that for an answer?

680
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:56,204
You're ruined either way.

681
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,706
Can't you see?

682
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,875
Have you gotten dumber in your old age?

683
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,087
If it's the right thing to do,
I'm fine with being ruined.

684
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,217
I've never known anyone

685
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,137
as despicable as you
on the face of the earth.

686
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,056
Don't pretend to be a saint
all of a sudden.

687
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,182
It makes me sick.

688
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,851
Jessica, listen carefully.

689
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,562
A weapon may not have a border,

690
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,565
but a lobbyist has his motherland.

691
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,358
I love this country where I was born.

692
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,194
If only for the sake of Korea,

693
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:33,867
I will never let you have the F-X plan.

694
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,702
You just wait.

695
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,502
Shit.

696
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,547
We have to let him go
unless we find something else.

697
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,510
We found Kim Woo-gi!

698
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,095
What?

699
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,180
What the...

700
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,351
What's going on?

701
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:04,898
Where is it?

702
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,233
Port of Tarifa, the south of Spain.

703
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,443
They are on a ship?

704
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,652
Yes.

705
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,820
Where are they headed?

706
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,906
Morocco.

707
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,910
They just escaped from there.
Why would they go back?

708
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,204
Kim Woo-gi is here, too!

709
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,664
What? Where?

710
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,168
Charles de Gaulle Airport, France.

711
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,170
Is this feed live?

712
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,131
What are they, Doctor Strange?

713
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,382
He's here, too!

714
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,468
Port of Naples, Italy.

715
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,388
They're at Antalya Airport, Turkey, too!

716
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,517
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

717
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,147
That's Cha Dal-geon!

718
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,652
What's going on?

719
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,614
I appreciate that you're working hard
day and night for the nation.

720
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,033
What the hell?

721
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,577
