BUILDING GA
ROW NA

2
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,802
Seolleongtang for breakfast,
gomtang for lunch.

3
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,261
What shall I order for your dinner?

4
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,222
How about sundaetguk?

5
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,100
I'll have dinner at home

6
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,602
because I'll be out soon.

7
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,145
You're mistaken.

8
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,775
You were also mistaken
when you crashed the plane.

9
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,734
That was reckless.

10
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,446
Don't accuse me without evidence.

11
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,491
You know Kim Woo-gi, right?

12
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,493
No, I never fucking saw him.

13
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,956
-What's with your arrogant tone?
-You started it.

14
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,376
You don't know Kim Woo-gi?

15
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,385
Now, I got you with one of your lies.

16
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,720
Only a few photos

17
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,056
can't put me behind bars.

18
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,433
Why do you think Michael is dead?

19
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,770
I don't need to know
why he killed himself.

20
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,656
Can you see the purple stain
on his right hand?

21
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,950
It's called a diphenylamine reaction.

22
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,036
It's from the nitrogen dioxide
emitted from the gun powder explosion.

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,581
Yeah, he shot himself.

24
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,416
You know he's left-handed.

25
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:52,172
But he used the right hand
to shoot himself to death?

26
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,386
Michael was killed.

27
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,473
You're very imaginative.

28
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,936
Let's say he was.
Then tell me why.

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,314
He wasn't cooperative with the attack,

30
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,108
or you needed to shut him up quickly.

31
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,486
You think I killed him?

32
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,533
Are you from the Stone Age?

33
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,661
Do you really think
this archaic method will work?

34
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,373
Making up a story to frame me?

35
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,964
A call recording between
O Sang-mi and Kim Woo-gi.

36
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,843
You know
I don't trust anything but money.

37
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,638
Did you get every penny
from John &amp; Mark?

38
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,806
I'll get the rest when the time's right.

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,516
Don't you turn your back on me.

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,727
You'll get the 5 billion
only if I'm alive.

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,105
This is the story I have so far.

42
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,191
You're welcome to correct me.

43
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,237
This little thing is your evidence
for arresting me?

44
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,199
You can't submit it to the court.

45
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,788
Don't you have more?

46
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,874
Something to catch me by surprise.

47
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,674
Let her go.

48
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,886
We need to hold her longer.

49
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,097
The Court dismissed the warrant

50
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,890
for lack of evidence.

51
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,184
They're warning us
not to touch her, right?

52
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,981
Have you figured out who's pulling
the strings behind the scene?

53
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,443
Something is up at the Blue House.

54
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,654
I couldn't figure out what.

55
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,534
Capturing Kim Woo-gi
would sort everything out.

56
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,663
Jeez.

57
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,399
Oh, shit.

58
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,404
Why am I seeing a drone here?

59
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,906
They must have changed the patrol time.
Run!

60
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,040
I found bottles of mineral water.

61
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,709
Do you see Kim Woo-gi?

62
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,006
Not from here. I'll go inside.

63
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,050
My teammates will be there soon.

64
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,218
If Kim's not there, we are both--

65
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,887
But if he is, it's a jackpot.

66
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,388
Dal-geon...

67
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,347
If you get caught--

68
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,266
I did this alone. Play dumb.

69
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,104
Shit!

70
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,777
Sorry, doors are always closed.

71
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,111
Are you the owner?

72
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,947
Yes, sir. I'm sorry I didn't hear...

73
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,199
Ok, sir. Go ahead.

74
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,514
I don't care who the tenants are
as long as they pay on time.

75
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,183
Take us to their apartment.

76
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,434
-Okay, sir.
-Let's go.

77
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,980
I collect money from the tenants
in the beginning of every month.

78
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,690
Come on, hurry up!

79
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,782
Who are you?

80
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,454
What are you looking for in here?

81
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,425
Can't we just talk in Korean?

82
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,226
Mr. Kim Woo-gi.

83
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,527
Let's have a look at that apartment.

84
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,120
Gosh! Get up!

85
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,498
Get the fuck up! You fucking bastard!

86
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,804
Get up! Come here, you bastard!

87
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,101
Please don't kill me.

88
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,021
You bastard!

89
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,735
Stop! Don't move!

90
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,495
Shut up!

91
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,373
What are you taking me for, too?

92
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,876
Get off me!

93
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,466
Isn't he Kim Woo-gi?

94
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,927
Yes, it's him.

95
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,055
-What's going on?
-You're just in time.

96
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,139
Get off me.

97
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,558
Ask them to uncuff me, will you?

98
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,310
He deserves to be fucking beaten!

99
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,062
I can't get them to understand.

100
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,939
Who the hell are you?

101
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,526
I'm one of the bereaved.
I was on TV, too.

102
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,110
Why are you here?

103
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,572
-Sorry?
-Who sent you?

104
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,077
I came to find my nephew's murderer
on my own.

105
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,079
You got a problem with that?

106
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,582
Take him to the police station.

107
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,667
Don't fucking touch me!

108
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,626
Tell them

109
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,670
he should be in our custody.

110
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,296
Let us take him. He's one of us.

111
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,882
It is crucial that we arrest
and interrogate him.

112
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,051
He said they needed
to interrogate him at the station.

113
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,637
What rights do you have
to do that?

114
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,140
Don't get smart with me
or I will arrest all of you.

115
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,351
He's threatening to arrest us, too.

116
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,812
-Seriously?
-I've done nothing wrong.

117
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,313
Tell them to uncuff me.

118
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,023
Come on! Move it!

119
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,567
-Just tell them!
-Move it! Now!

120
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,485
Come on! Hey!

121
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,403
Shut up and walk.

122
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,946
Get off me! Hey!

123
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,156
Don't! Uncuff me!

124
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,158
-I remember him now.
-Let go of me!

125
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,285
He's Cha Dal-geon.

126
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,704
He disclosed the truth
about the crash at the Blue House.

127
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,455
But why is he here?

128
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,380
TEAM LEADER GI

129
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,594
Yes, sir.

130
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,345
Come to the police station now.

131
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,638
Pardon?

132
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,974
Police station? Why?

133
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,309
Kim Woo-gi is in custody.

134
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,186
He's caught?

135
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,731
Yes, I'll be right there.

136
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,278
Good job, God of War.

137
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,195
Bruce Chan.

138
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,573
Wow!

139
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,264
Dal-geon!

140
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,142
What's happening?

141
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,435
Don't worry.

142
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,188
Mr. Gi is talking to the police chief,

143
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,481
so you'll be out soon.

144
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,650
I told you

145
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,153
if we worked together,
we could catch this motherfucker.

146
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,905
Here, give me a high five.

147
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,035
-Argh!
-Just a bit closer!

148
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,245
A bit more! You can do it!

149
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,123
Go! Go!

150
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,501
Go! Go!

151
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,794
Is it

152
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,170
necessary to do it now?

153
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,880
Yes, it is.

154
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,507
because I'm over the moon.

155
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,092
-Come closer, a bit more!
-Go!

156
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,760
-Come on girl!
-Yes, come on!

157
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,348
Just a bit closer.

158
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,146
-Again, again!
-Come on!

159
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,731
Just a bit closer.

160
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,784
-High five!
-Yeah.

161
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,622
You're lucky to be here together.

162
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,843
Time is up. Give me my jacket.

163
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,011
What shall we do?

164
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,599
Let her go.

165
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,066
Yes, everything is fine.

166
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,528
We got a call from Gi Tae-ung.

167
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,988
-Put him through.
-Yes, sir.

168
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,575
What do you have?

169
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,494
We've got Kim Woo-gi.

170
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,040
Good job!

171
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,375
I knew I could count on you!

172
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,377
I didn't capture him.

173
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,753
What?

174
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,338
Then who did?

175
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,217
Go Hae-ri

176
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,846
and Cha Dal-geon, one of the bereaved.

177
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,681
Cha Dal-geon?

178
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,391
He followed you there?

179
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,059
Yes.

180
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,562
It doesn't matter who did it.

181
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,065
Things aren't going well here,

182
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,402
so make Kim talk as much as you can
before coming back.

183
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,321
You got it.

184
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,004
Well...

185
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,216
Jessica says she'll have dinner at home.
What shall we do?

186
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,718
Don't worry about external pressure.
Just do your job.

187
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,803
I'll report to the President personally.

188
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,194
Well...

189
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,906
You need to go back inside.

190
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,575
Why? Do we have unfinished business?

191
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,577
Yes, choosing your menu for dinner.

192
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,287
Come again?

193
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,376
Kim Woo-gi is captured.

194
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,215
Take her back.

195
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,217
What does it have to do with me?

196
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,302
-Let's go.
-Don't you touch me!

197
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,888
Do you know how much this jacket costs?

198
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,266
Maybe I should just rip it apart.

199
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,268
Let's go.

200
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,454
We got Kim Woo-gi

201
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,207
and no one is dead or even hurt.

202
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,126
I don't see anything wrong with it.

203
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,753
You don't know what mistake you made?

204
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,339
You said I was incompetent
without a sense of duty.

205
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,925
You were wrong.

206
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,385
I did it to prove that.

207
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,554
You're pathetic.

208
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,180
Let me be honest with you.

209
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,058
You're worried about how to report this

210
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,729
because I and Cha Dal-geon got him
while senior agents did nothing.

211
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,022
Right?

212
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,983
I wanted to see reliability,
not your ability.

213
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,612
Whether we could trust you with our lives.

214
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,825
You aren't qualified to be on my team.

215
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,452
You failed.

216
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,789
Sir!

217
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,750
I reported it was you who caught him.

218
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,964
You will surely get the reward

219
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,842
that you love so much.

220
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,220
Such a narrow mind for a team leader.

221
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,021
If you trusted her from the beginning,
everything would be fine.

222
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,524
Isn't it a bit hilarious

223
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,195
a team leader talks about qualifications
when he can't trust his own team?

224
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,197
Drop it, Dal-geon.

225
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,866
Do you always mind others' businesses?

226
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,619
I saved your ass,

227
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,287
but you're blaming me for it?

228
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,248
Without Hae-ri Go,

229
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,418
you couldn't have caught that jerk.

230
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,711
Drop it.

231
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,505
It was only a matter of time.

232
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,174
But you got in our way
and messed up the situation.

233
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,928
We got him, though
while you were fucking wasting time.

234
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,897
I'm warning you

235
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,566
if you cross the line again,

236
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,069
I won't let it pass.

237
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,621
Finding out why my nephew had to die

238
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,959
is what you call "crossing the line"?

239
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,747
When will Jessica be out?

240
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,959
Tomorrow morning at the latest?

241
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,461
Are you sure?

242
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,258
Shadow will personally see to it tonight.

243
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,719
Jeez...

244
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,523
I will be there by 8:30
to see the President.

245
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,358
Thank you, Secretary Kim.

246
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,913
I'm surprised you called.

247
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,249
Dinner?

248
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,549
Okay, see you there.

249
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,765
You seem to be in a good mood.

250
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,476
Do I?

251
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,978
I got nothing good going on.

252
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,275
You caught Kim Woo-gi,
which is a good thing.

253
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,533
However,

254
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,872
do you think the President will be glad
to hear the news?

255
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,834
What do you mean?

256
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:51,046
He always thinks
what's best for our nation.

257
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:52,840
I know that.

258
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,341
For the F-X plan, he thinks

259
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,718
working with John &amp; Mark

260
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,720
is good for our nation's interests.

261
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,308
"Catching a real culprit
who crashed the plane."

262
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,855
"The terrorist confessed
John &amp; Mark was behind the attack."

263
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,693
It'd be the worst news for the President.

264
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,571
What do you want?

265
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,073
The Task Force team
in charge of the investigation

266
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,491
must be completely changed.

267
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,702
Not only Chief Gang Ju-cheol,

268
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
but every one of them.

269
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,082
Which means

270
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,751
I should cover up the truth?

271
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,462
Because it's an inconvenient truth.

272
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,423
Look, Senior Secretary Yun.

273
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,216
Are you out of your mind?

274
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,261
A show can go on
as long as there's a villain.

275
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,139
For the President
and the nation's interest,

276
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,350
I will willingly bear a crown of thorns.

277
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,727
You're out of your mind.

278
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,687
You're utterly crazy.

279
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,490
So you're the last piece of
the axis of evil.

280
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,209
These documents are about your corruption
when you were Head of the Security Office

281
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,419
at the Blue House.

282
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,004
What?

283
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,341
You heavily extorted
defense industry companies

284
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,135
and took bribes from Dynamic twice.

285
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,178
Min Jae-sik!

286
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,598
The stocks your brother-in-law gave you
rose five times.

287
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,851
You got them for free in an expedient way.

288
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:28,936
You bastard!

289
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,437
If the documents are exposed,

290
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,149
you and your acquaintances
will be badly hurt.

291
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,070
The opposition party
aiming for the next election

292
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,738
will show a lot of interest.

293
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,034
Let me ask you the same question.

294
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:48,205
Do you think your shitty scheme
will make the President happy?

295
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,916
I've served him for 15 years
as his secretary

296
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,668
ever since he was an assemblyman.

297
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,003
Nobody knows

298
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,091
what he really thinks better than I do.

299
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,427
You are mistaken.

300
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,764
I'll do what I think is right,

301
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,349
so do whatever you want.

302
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,106
Jeez, he's being tough.

303
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,527
What if we get blamed for everything?

304
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:37,963
He's ready to see you.

305
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,892
I'll wait outside.

306
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,353
Is it something important?

307
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,940
We've just started,
so it might take a while.

308
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,904
It's something that you must know.

309
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,825
You're making me tense.

310
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,952
You're ruining this massage.

311
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,538
Mr. President, excuse me for doing this.

312
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,040
Sure, go ahead.

313
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,420
Yes, right there.

314
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,881
I'm really stiff right there.

315
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,760
I hear stress causes cancer.

316
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,014
How's your health, Director An?
Are you okay?

317
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,849
Yes, I'm fine.

318
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,063
Because the NIS Director General is fine,
the President isn't.

319
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,648
Your overworking

320
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,901
will help me work less.

321
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,944
My apologies, sir.

322
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,781
The review in Minju Daily

323
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,701
fucking bluntly criticized
the next generation fighter plan.

324
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,538
I support John &amp; Mark
not because I have an agenda,

325
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,706
but because it's a good deal

326
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,460
and it helps complete
the independence of national defense.

327
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,589
Come on, except for Cha Dal-geon's claim,

328
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,966
there's no evidence.

329
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,260
Am I wrong?

330
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,888
Well, as a matter of fact...

331
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,389
What?

332
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,851
You think I'm wrong?

333
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,605
How loyal you are.

334
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,316
You think you're a loyal subject
from the Joseon Dynasty?

335
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,152
No, Mr. President. You're right.

336
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,739
Then why did you allow
the shitty reviews to be published?

337
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,699
The press is

338
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,410
like a fucking foal.

339
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,206
It'll go wild
once you let go of the reins.

340
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,502
That's why

341
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,796
I'm getting weaker

342
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,090
like this

343
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,300
whereas you're robust.

344
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,680
Wait outside.

345
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,732
My head hurts.

346
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:08,405
Has anyone died of high blood pressure
while getting a massage?

347
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,615
No, Mr. President.

348
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,786
Wow, that's good.

349
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,706
To be a loyal subject is simple.

350
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,793
Doing a job sincerely like you

351
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,212
so that I can conduct the State affairs.

352
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:29,050
That's what a loyal subject does.

353
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,148
You beat me to it.

354
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,450
I've been thinking a lot on the way here.

355
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,244
You and I are doing this

356
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,996
for the sake of our nation,

357
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,834
but how we think is very different.

358
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,547
The President can be hurt
if things go wrong.

359
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,469
That's why

360
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,262
he doesn't know.

361
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,475
He's never been briefed about it.

362
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,144
Let me hear your plan, then.

363
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,606
What do you want to do
by changing the TF team?

364
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,902
What difference will
changing one team make?

365
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,662
Kim Woo-gi will be dead tomorrow.

366
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,461
We want a neat and quiet funeral.

367
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,297
In order to do that,

368
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,884
we need to change the chief mourner.

369
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,934
I guess we finally meet.

370
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,227
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Do Su.

371
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,441
Forget it.
We are here to do nothing good.

372
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,382
Look.

373
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,094
Share with me
what you guys babbled on about.

374
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,513
What a pain in the ass.

375
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,057
I'm not here to interpret.

376
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,933
Such an amateur.

377
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,186
Didn't you hear
you need to work with us closely?

378
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,689
You're just here
to take a free ride from me.

379
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,691
What a parasite.

380
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,859
Hey, bitch.

381
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,153
Do you have a death wish?

382
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,238
How much is the NIS paying you for this?

383
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,199
How much is John &amp; Mark paying you?

384
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,452
I'll give you that money.
Just get the fuck out.

385
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,372
A crazy bitch is roaming around
in broad daylight.

386
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,873
"A crazy bitch"?

387
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,416
Fucking asshole!

388
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,232
I'm sorry.

389
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,442
Pardon?

390
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:15,819
I said I was sorry.

391
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,154
Don't be discouraged.

392
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,656
Cheer up!

393
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,825
Elsa.

394
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,084
He just gave me a finger, right?

395
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,128
Well, I think he meant something else.

396
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,882
Ready for the interrogation?

397
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,009
-Oh, yes.
-Good.

398
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,264
Mustang,
don't you have something to say to Elsa?

399
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,392
Well,

400
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,394
what would we have done without you?

401
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,690
Said Zombie.

402
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,358
What the...

403
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,403
No, actually...

404
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,946
I wish

405
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,365
I had a sister like Elsa.

406
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,785
Said Mustang.

407
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,120
My, my.

408
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,414
Good job. Go get Mr. Gi.

409
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,458
-Uh...
-Jeez.

410
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,753
What's got into their heads?

411
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,963
-Oh, man.
-What's wrong with them?

412
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,300
You're the heroin of this operation.

413
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:24,137
They're sorry
for how bad they've treated you.

414
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,559
We can't say much because of Gi,

415
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,978
but when we go back to Seoul,
we'll surely report--

416
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:32,937
Go inside.

417
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,698
We're ready for the interrogation.

418
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,950
Why is Cha Dal-geon here?

419
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,119
He's here as a witness.

420
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,247
We don't need him.
Get him out of here.

421
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,542
He's the only one who saw the terrorist.

422
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,962
We need him for cross-examination.

423
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,310
Who was behind

424
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,395
the attack on the plane?

425
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,487
"Attack"?

426
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,160
I saw the plane going down...

427
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,317
So I escaped for my life.

428
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,286
Who was behind the attack?

429
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,955
Jeez.

430
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,540
Who ordered it?

431
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,635
Cha Dal-geon?

432
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,021
-Whoa!
-You think it's a joke?

433
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,105
-You can't do this!
-Come on!

434
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,149
-Come on!
-No, let him go!

435
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,692
Get him out of here!

436
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,736
-Let's go.
-Let go of me.

437
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,237
Tell the truth.

438
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,282
The bastard with a scar on his face
confessed everything!

439
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,744
You're fucking bluffing.

440
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,288
If Jerome got caught,
you wouldn't--

441
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,670
Jerome?

442
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,589
You heard that? "Jerome"?

443
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,049
Jerome?

444
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,510
Is Jerome the terrorist?

445
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,018
What's wrong with him?

446
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,395
-What is this?
-Oh, God! Look at me!

447
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,897
Come on, man!

448
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,231
I'll go get the doctor.

449
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,611
What the fuck is wrong with him?
Did you take poison?

450
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,404
Wake up, man!

451
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,697
-Get off!
-Come on!

452
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,042
He's a fucking junkie.

453
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,169
Drug.

454
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,091
The painkiller you're taking
can prevent him from going into shock.

455
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,594
Give me the drug. I need the drug!

456
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,679
-Please!
-Don't fucking move!

457
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,557
-What is it?
-It has morphine in it.

458
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,649
What are you doing?

459
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,777
Tell us first who was behind the attack.

460
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,864
It's all over if he's fucking dead!

461
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:13,866
Get off me!

462
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,578
Get off me, damn it!

463
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,747
Crazy bastard!

464
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,583
Give him a shot!

465
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,460
Don't, Hae-ri!

466
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,586
It's an order! Do it!

467
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,600
Please, give me...

468
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,686
Argh!

469
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,690
Jeez!

470
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,989
He could die of shock. Give him a shot!

471
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,034
Who was behind the attack?

472
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,120
-Go Hae-ri!
-Who was it?

473
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,501
What the fuck?

474
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,003
Who was it?

475
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,379
Fuck!

476
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,214
I don't know.

477
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,340
I don't know.

478
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,552
Michael! It's Michael!

479
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,553
He's the vice president!

480
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,642
Michael?

481
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,019
Who is he?

482
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,937
The vice president of John &amp; Mark.

483
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,648
Are you sure he ordered the attack?

484
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,234
I can take it no more.
Please give me a shot first.

485
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,570
Give me the evidence that it was him.

486
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,155
Please...

487
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,409
A secret bank account...

488
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,038
"A secret bank account"?

489
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,042
Michael...

490
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:55,945
Michael

491
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,823
gave me

492
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,701
five billion won--

493
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,162
He's in shock.

494
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,121
Hurry!

495
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,755
You know he's left-handed.

496
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,549
But he used the right hand
to shoot himself to death?

497
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,011
Michael was killed.

498
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,157
The account number.

499
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:30,289
The account where you received
five billion from Michael.

500
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,503
Did I say that?

501
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,256
I don't remember.

502
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,591
Hey!

503
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,302
What did you just say?

504
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,097
I have the right to remain silent,
so don't bother me.

505
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,059
Fucking son of a bitch!

506
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,477
Hitting him won't help.

507
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,562
This bastard

508
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,815
is a murderer who killed 200 people.

509
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,358
My job is taking him back safely.

510
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,484
You'd better let me go.

511
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,988
We're ready to leave.

512
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,909
Can't you stop already?

513
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,286
You two will end up growing on each other.

514
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,525
You and Cha Dal-geon will come separately.

515
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,162
What an asshole!

516
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,413
He's an asshole alright,

517
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,750
but he's not a traitor like Min Jae-sik.

518
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,960
I don't like his eyes.

519
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,378
Taxi!

520
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:28,574
The car just drove past me.
It is headed towards you.

521
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,624
What is the problem?
Why is the road closed?

522
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,043
There has been an accident.
A tow truck is back there.

523
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,130
What's going on?

524
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,884
-There's an accident. We need to detour.
-Man...

525
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,761
Okay. Let's go, then.

526
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,440
Go! Get out of here.

527
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,827
We're going to the airport, right?

528
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,539
Yes, he said this leads to the road
to the airport.

529
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,937
What's wrong?
What is going on?

530
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,689
Road is closed.
Go back to where you came from.

531
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,316
-Why?
-Due to construction. Now, move it!

532
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,070
-Is it really necessary?
-Are you interrogating me? Go! Scram!

533
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,447
What are they saying?

534
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,990
It's under construction.
We can't go this way.

535
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:51,907
What are you waiting for?

536
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,117
We should take the other road.

537
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,702
What the heck is...

538
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,454
Take care of it. We might miss them.

539
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,499
Please, let the car pass.

540
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,586
The road is closed due to construction.

541
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,296
We don't want to be late for our flight.

542
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,553
I wonder if they're redeveloping the area.

543
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,598
It's pretty desolate.

544
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,730
Hey, where do you think you're going?

545
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,689
I'm late. I need to work.

546
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,732
What?

547
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,775
Okay. I'll pay you.

548
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,404
Wait here.

549
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,699
-The road is closed.
-You're not going to let us pass?

550
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,867
-Hey, why...
-What did he say?

551
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,702
-What's with the constructions?
-We are not looking for trouble.

552
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,370
We missed them.

553
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,456
Who do you think you are? Jacki Chan?

554
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,957
Let us pass through.

555
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,459
The road is closed.

556
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,710
Just us, please!

557
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,317
What about you, communist?

558
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:09,944
My, my!

559
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,029
Are you chickened out?

560
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,785
Kim Woo-gi's head is mine.

561
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,497
I won't let the crazy bitch
take the credit.

562
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,178
Pull out!

563
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,060
Whoa!

564
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,956
Don't say...

565
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:50,961
Get in the backseat.

566
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,380
-Get out!
-Huh?

567
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,614
Go!

568
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,840
No...

569
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:40,844
Get out!

570
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,137
Run!

571
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,266
Argh!

572
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,325
Mr. Gi!

573
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,786
Go with Kim Woo-gi.

574
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,371
What about you?

575
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,832
I can use the rifle there. Go now!

576
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,875
You go with him.

577
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,377
Mr. Gi! Sir!

578
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,545
Keep going, you bastard!

579
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,083
Get in!

580
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,588
Get in!

581
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,611
Fuck!

582
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,414
I think the bullet hit his artery.

583
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,291
Let's go to the nearest hospital.

584
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,751
No, it can be dangerous!

585
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,586
How long to the Korean Embassy?

586
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,629
About 40-50 minutes?

587
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,923
It depends on the traffic.

588
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,301
He could die before we get there.

589
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,012
Hold on. I will be there
in 20, no, 10 minutes.

590
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,998
GI TAE-UNG

591
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,710
Yes. What about Kim Woo-gi?

592
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,588
He's shot on the leg.
He's bleeding a lot.

593
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:04,631
"Shot"?

594
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,008
We were ambushed.

595
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,261
We're on our way to the Embassy now!

596
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,597
I'll give them a call.

597
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,849
What about the team?

598
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,976
Except for Hae-ri and Se-hun,

599
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,437
everyone died on site.

600
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,113
BUILDING GA
ROW BA

601
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,193
The local police are also in on it!

602
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,989
It's going to be difficult to take
Kim Woo-gi back home.

603
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,991
I'll send some backup we can trust.

604
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,826
Stay put at the Embassy.

605
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,682
Don't do that. Huh?

606
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,725
What's going on?

607
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,020
Wait. What are you doing?

608
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,189
We're shutting down the operation.

609
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,441
Take their phones
and turn off the computers.

610
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,610
-Okay.
-Hang on.

611
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,946
Hang on a second.

612
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:54,449
Hold on. What are you doing?

613
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,785
Let me go!

614
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,662
Wait a moment!

615
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,498
Don't touch it!

616
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,250
-Get off me!
-Get off me, please!

617
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,377
What's wrong with you?

618
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,254
What the heck is wrong with you?

619
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,298
Hurry. You're leaving tonight.

620
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,051
Okay, thanks.

621
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,727
What are you doing?

622
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,062
Hey, Chief Gang!

623
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,772
You...

624
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,317
Now you will be arrested
for revealing a State secret

625
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,694
and profiting the enemy.

626
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,698
Therefore, I need you
to quietly cooperate.

627
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:36,533
Cuff him.

628
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:37,951
I'm sorry, sir.

629
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,792
We can just talk, please!

630
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,836
Stop!

631
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,767
Min will take over the TF team.

632
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,897
Cuff him.

633
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,608
For a fucking spy

634
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,194
and fucking traitor,
you're strong but brainless.

635
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,990
Who from above is pressuring you?

636
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,162
Take him now.

637
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,582
Who on earth made you like this?

638
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,834
Director General!

639
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,795
Director An!

640
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,129
Jeez.

641
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:58,657
You can lean on me.

642
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,617
I'm fine.

643
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,416
How do I look?

644
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,001
Fine.

645
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,381
Shadow

646
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,758
certainly knows what he's doing.

647
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,490
I told you

648
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,701
that you were making a big mistake.

649
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,037
Even Michael was once a CIA agent.

650
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,291
Drop by
when you can't find a place to work.

651
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,294
I could use your skill
for making up a story.

652
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:10,812
How did it go?

653
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,318
They went into the Embassy.

654
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,823
Hae-ri!

655
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,658
Chief Gang called you, right?

656
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,118
-Yes.
-Where's the doctor?

657
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,913
Nobody is willing to come, so...

658
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,247
we're still looking, but...

659
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,957
-Take him to the infirmary upstairs.
-Okay.

660
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,334
Let's go.

661
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,339
Doctor Lim.

662
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,674
Hey, what's with the video call?

663
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,676
I can't tell you in detail.

664
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,511
I need your help with a gunshot wound.

665
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,765
Over there!

666
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,316
They are outside.

667
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,737
Look for surgical tools.

668
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,073
-What?
-Now!

669
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,324
Grab him here, quickly!

670
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:20,757
Get your things.

671
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,176
For what?

672
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,678
Not for farming, obviously.

673
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,805
We'll go inside to kill him.

674
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,807
It's the Embassy.

675
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,891
So what?

676
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,394
I didn't come all the way here
to miss the target.

677
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,728
Wow.

678
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,399
What a sucker.
You know nothing about the basics.

679
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,736
I can gauge your eyes out
with this sucker's finger.

680
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,613
Darling.

681
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,949
If you're wanted internationally,

682
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,743
you have to stay low your whole life.

683
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,914
I can't work with this fucking amateur.

684
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,293
You just wait and see.

685
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,380
After killing Kim Woo-gi,
I'll cut open your throat.

686
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:05,260
Am I a beer bottle
for you to open? You fucking sucker!

687
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,649
How is he?

688
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,443
I need to see the artery first.

689
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,485
Did you stop the bleeding?

690
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,611
-You have to bear with it.
-Yes.

691
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,447
Open the wound wider.

692
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,283
Sir, we've got no scalpels or anesthetics.

693
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,617
Bring me whatever there is!

694
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,417
His wrist!

695
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,807
-Hold him.
-Gloves.

696
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,194
Sterilize it.

697
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,987
Are you going to operate?

698
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,864
He can do it.

699
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,741
He's a real special agent.

700
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,660
Pour the povidone-iodine.

701
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,162
Hold him.

702
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:36,935
Pour it more.

703
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,358
In there, you'll find

704
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,735
an artery as thick as a straw.

705
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:47,904
Stretch open the wound.

706
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,032
-Sir?
-Stay focused!

707
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,617
Se-hun, you come here!

708
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,495
Come here. Hold this.

709
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,249
That's okay. I can do it.

710
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,469
Wider!

711
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,104
That's it, right there! That's the artery.

712
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,940
Okay, luckily,

713
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,693
it's not completely severed.
Will you be able to operate?

714
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,071
Yes.

715
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,157
I'll give it a go.

716
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,923
Good, right there. Right there, stop!

717
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,439
Stay focused!

718
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,290
Cut it.

719
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,003
Cut it.

720
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:37,805
Cut it.

721
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,310
Gauze.

722
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,229
Bandage.

723
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,857
Here.

724
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,075
-Done.
-Good job.

725
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,869
Good job, sir.

726
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,880
What?

727
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,258
-What?
-What's wrong with him?

728
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,718
What's wrong?

729
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,972
Doctor, he's suddenly convulsing!
What's happening to him?

730
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,515
He bled too much.

731
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,600
Without a blood transfusion, he could die.

Kim Woo-gi, wake up!

733
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,272
-What's your blood type?
-It's O.

734
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,567
How do you know?

735
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,277
I read all about him before coming here.

736
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,282
Mine is O, too. Give him my blood.

737
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,330
Hang in there. Don't fucking die.

738
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,293
Take my blood now!

Jeez.
