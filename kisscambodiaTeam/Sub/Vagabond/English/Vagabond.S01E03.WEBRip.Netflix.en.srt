1
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,890
SAMAEL SENT A MESSAGE

2
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,000
Engine number three failed.
The cabin altitude is rising.

3
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,253
Do we have a hole somewhere?

4
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,139
Why isn't the panel working?

5
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,850
Latitude, altitude, airspeed.
Nothing's visible, sir.

6
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,226
Let's stand by and take control.

7
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,312
The stick isn't working. What's wrong?

8
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,903
That's the end
of the flight deck recording.

9
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,881
Fill it up, please.

10
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,008
My gosh.

11
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,761
I'm thirsty and hungry.

12
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,597
I'm sorry but...

13
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,809
Can you go in there and grab me some?

14
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,575
What?

15
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,745
-What's wrong?
-Get in the car!

16
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,433
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT...

17
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,520
Presuming a terrorist attack
based on a call is a stretch.

18
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,190
It seems to me like codes.

19
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,525
But I don't get these times.

20
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,777
Miss Go.

21
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,114
More than 90% of the evidence
points to aircraft failure.

22
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,659
Please try not to cause confusion.

23
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,287
Okay.

24
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,706
I'll come back
with a solid piece of evidence.

25
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,298
Thank you for your help.

26
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,926
The times are identical.

27
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,932
Look. The first sign of malfunction
appeared at 13:15.

28
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,812
The panel stopped working at 13:20.

29
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,480
Why isn't the panel working?

30
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,357
The stick malfunction at 13:23.

31
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,942
The stick isn't working.

32
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,694
The time of the plane crash...

33
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,659
13:30

34
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,040
Help!

35
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,709
Where is...

36
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,170
Over here!

37
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,713
A gunshot... Oh!

38
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,173
Over here!

39
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,219
He got shot!

40
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,227
He got shot! Understand?

41
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,192
For the sake of the innocent victims,

42
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,943
we must find out the truth.

43
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,029
Please help, Doctor.

44
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:12,033
The ICAO will never agree
without any concrete evidence.

45
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,414
I have a video clip of the terrorist.

46
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,417
I'll send it to you by e-mail.

47
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,881
Let's do this.

48
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,300
We'll dig up the truth about the crash.

49
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,427
Thank you, Doctor.

50
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,974
Go Hae-ri speaking.

51
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,352
Ho-sik got shot.

52
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,687
Huh? What happened?

53
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,400
I know the hospital.
I'll stop by my house and go there.

54
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,444
Wait!

55
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,197
You were right.

56
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,283
We found evidence from the black box.

57
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,953
The plane...

58
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,455
was attacked.

59
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,627
I'll fill you in later.

60
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,899
What?

61
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,693
Where did my laptop go?

62
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,628
Mask off. Now!

63
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,386
You... The hotel cleaner?

64
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,182
Tell them he's with the one
who crashed the plane.

65
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,184
Turn around.

66
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,438
Get down on your knees.

67
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,026
Who sent you?

68
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,569
I don't know.

69
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,281
I was offered 10,000 euros
for killing you and staging a suicide.

70
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,868
Even if I kill you right now,
it would be self-defense.

71
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,413
Talk if you want to live.

72
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,957
I'm telling you.
We only talked on the phone.

73
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,460
Take out your phone.

74
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,717
Call that person.

75
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,262
If you don't, I'll shoot.

76
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,985
Hello...

77
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,781
-Hey, say something.
-Dal-geon?

78
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,994
How come you have this phone?

79
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,663
Ho-sik is still in surgery.

80
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,626
Are you saying this is Ho-sik's phone?

81
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,421
You're the one who called.

82
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,846
Listen carefully, Dal-geon.

83
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,599
The person who owns this phone,

84
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,477
just tried to kill me.

85
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,562
What?

86
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,772
Catch Ho-sik.

87
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,233
He's with the terrorist.

88
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,409
If we catch Ho-sik,
we can solve this case.

89
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,482
Where is the guy?

90
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,150
The man who got shot!

91
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,277
That guy!

92
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,645
Ho-sik? It's Cha Dal-geon.

93
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,981
Do you know where Go Hae-ri is staying?

94
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,316
Why do you ask?

95
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,670
The video is gone?

96
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,255
Don't worry.

97
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,550
I sent a copy to my NIS colleague.

98
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,760
We'll identify the terrorist
by tomorrow.

99
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,890
That's a relief. I'll wait for your call.

100
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,038
Go on.

101
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,749
We have a problem here.

102
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,586
I'm listening.

103
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,566
-Don't come near me!
-Mr. Kim.

104
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,695
You see this?

105
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,448
One bite and I'm gone.

106
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,159
-Stop acting crazy.
-Crazy?

107
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,746
You are the crazy ones.

108
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,873
Stop the bullshit!

109
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
Why did you kill my nephew?

110
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,753
Why did you blow up the plane?

111
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,562
Let's cool down and talk.

112
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,191
Don't throw away your life.
Think of your wife and daughter.

113
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,152
To save my wife and daughter,

114
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,364
this is the only way.

115
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,000
Mr. Kim!

116
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,043
Mr. Kim!

117
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,712
Stay with me, Mr. Kim.

118
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,713
Mr. Kim!

119
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,428
Don't...

120
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,305
Don't do anything.

121
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,933
Those people...

122
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,686
They are terrifying.

123
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,897
-Mr. Kim!
-Hey. You!

124
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,526
Talk before you die. Who are they? Huh?

125
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,946
-Stop it.
-Talk, you bastard!

126
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,489
Who is it?

127
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,366
Who killed my nephew?

128
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,368
-Talk!
-Stop it now!

129
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,666
Christ!

130
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,927
Please hurry. It's an emergency.

131
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,555
I called the police.

132
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,656
-Give me the gun.
-What? Why?

133
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,034
Your hands are shaking. Give it!

134
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,660
Shut up.

135
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,497
You're a civilian and I'm a special agent.

136
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,501
I'm not going to let you die.

137
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,920
So don't worry and just trust--

138
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,966
Fuck.

139
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,635
Hey!

140
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,180
What a nutcase!

141
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,078
Hey!

142
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,040
Come on!

143
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,378
-You wanna kill yourself?
-What about you?

144
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,755
Getting you shot will be the end of me.

145
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,676
Wait right here.

146
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,970
What are you doing?

147
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,140
Do you know how hard I trained
for a situation like this?

148
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,809
This injury is not-- Ouch!

149
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,060
What the--

150
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,111
Do you see that car?

151
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,864
Can you get there in three seconds?

152
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,868
He's using a bolt-action rifle.

153
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,120
He has to work the bolt after each shot,

154
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,789
which takes three seconds.

155
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,041
A moving target makes it harder.

156
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,546
We will have a better chance
if we get there.

157
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,882
It's out of range from the roof.

158
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,427
We have to make it in just three seconds.

159
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,221
Can you do it?

160
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,226
Four seconds.

161
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,741
Run!

162
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,179
-What?
-Do you want to get shot?

163
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,140
Even a slight scratch
will leave a hole under your chin.

164
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,436
Special gadget for special agents?

165
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,321
No one's here.

166
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,376
Where did he go? Shit.

167
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,511
Damn!

168
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,343
MEMORIAL TOWER

169
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,928
PLEDGE TO THE NATION

170
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,264
Security sweep.

171
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,807
Everybody stand up.

172
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,186
-Your cooperation is appreciated.
-Bear with us.

173
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,187
Why?

174
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,814
What is this? This is so embarrassing.

175
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,524
You're new, right?

176
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,735
Hey, watch your hands.

177
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,946
Stop groping me, you bastard!

178
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,907
For god's sake.

179
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,928
Do you have everything?

180
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,180
Let me take one video file.

181
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,226
We're from the same town. Come on, Kim!

182
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,978
Do you have something to hide?

183
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,564
It's a picture of me butt naked.

184
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,066
It'll hurt your eyes.

185
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,071
No worries.
My insurance will take care of it.

186
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,159
That idiot. I should gouge his eyes out!

187
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,830
What's this?

188
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,998
What the hell is going on?

189
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,752
There's been a security breach
in this room.

190
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,505
Does that mean you can sweep the place?

191
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,549
Who gave the order?

192
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,175
Mr. Gi Tae-ung did, sir.

193
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,594
God, damn it...

194
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,013
Where is that prick?

195
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,521
Hey, Gi Tae-ung.

196
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,316
Did you order a sweep of my office
behind my back?

197
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,068
You've grown some balls.

198
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,947
Seven years ago, today,

199
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,825
my colleague died.

200
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,661
I believe you know him.

201
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,873
Code name, Blaise Pascal.

202
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,208
When there's a security sweep

203
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,170
your predecessors always gave a heads-up.

204
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,881
That's how things work,
courtesy to your superiors.

205
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,467
The operation was a success
and he had time to escape but...

206
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,512
Do you know why he died?

207
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,351
Because the operation command violated
a small rule.

208
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,687
-Hey, that was--
-That's why...

209
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,608
my friend died for nothing.

210
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,945
I'll get rid of wrong traditions,

211
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,031
and stick to the rules.

212
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,750
Damn that cocky bastard.

213
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,425
Honorable Chief Gang.

214
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:12,761
Can I ask you a small favor?

215
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,388
Go Hae-ri sent me a video

216
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,141
but the Inspection guys took it
in a security sweep.

217
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,976
Your authority would...

218
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,979
Chief?

219
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,482
Chief, help me this once!

220
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,196
You know very well
Mr. Gi always listens to you!

221
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,906
Sir?

222
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,699
Come on, Chief!

223
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,785
Just this once...

224
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,537
Disgusting.

225
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,374
He must have drunk his ass off last night.

226
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,334
Oh, stuff it.

227
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,087
He has no authority at all.

228
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,006
Gross.

229
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,780
Don't...

230
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,907
Don't do anything.

231
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,287
Those people... They are terrifying...

232
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,171
Loss of secret intelligence,
use of unauthorized equipment, hacking.

233
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,590
There are 27 security breaches.

234
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,886
This is a 30% increase
on last year's first quarter.

235
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:42,600
Now, please turn to page five
of the report in front of you.

236
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,768
GO HAE-RI

237
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,773
The person you're trying to reach...

238
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,526
He's ignoring my call again.

239
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,197
Fine, you do that.

240
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,159
I'll make you regret so bad.

241
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,621
Any unauthorized equipment
found during a full inspection

242
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,123
will be strictly dealt--

243
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,380
Sorry, I'm late.

244
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,258
Don't bother coming when you're late.

245
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,968
Oh, you mean it?

246
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,021
How many times have I told you
to turn off your phone?

247
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,064
Sorry, sir.

248
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,443
Yes, I'm in a meeting. Bye.

249
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,861
The plane crash...

250
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,905
It was a terrorist attack.

251
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,782
What?

252
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:43,370
I just uncovered a grand secret
from the black box.

253
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,456
We have been a laughing stock.

254
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,708
But if you and I catch this terrorist,

255
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,543
we can shove a big one

256
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,670
to those who screwed us over.

257
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,756
Gang. What are you doing?

258
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,174
Turn it off and...

259
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,596
The B357 crash was a terrorist attack.

260
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,015
-What?
-What?

261
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,022
Chief? Hello?

262
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,484
The Director General is here.
Report directly.

263
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,319
GO HAE-RI

264
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,031
This is An.
What do you mean by a terrorist attack?

265
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,579
This is Agent Go Hae-ri from Morocco.

266
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,625
I found a phone call of the terrorist
from the black box audio file.

267
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,966
There is an accomplice.

268
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,554
It's Kim Woo-gi,
the co-pilot of the plane.

269
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,223
-Are you sure about this?
-Yes.

270
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,351
I checked it together
with Dr. Kevin of the ICAO.

271
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:52,439
I sent Agent Gong Hwa-suk
a clip of the terrorist.

272
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,400
I'll return to the HQ
with further details.

273
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,653
Go. Who said you could come back?

274
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,740
You should write up
a detailed report first and--

275
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,824
Return right now!

276
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,827
Right away, sir.

277
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,167
They're pulling me back.

278
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,252
We should hurry to the hotel
to get our stuff.

279
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,254
You go alone.

280
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,385
The terrorist and the co-pilot
are hiding here somewhere.

281
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,222
I'm not going home until I catch them.

282
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,018
Do you think we're at a zoo?

283
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,354
Are they going to show up on schedule
if you want them to?

284
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,024
They will show up again.

285
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,151
Because they want me dead.

286
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,279
If I get those two, I can end this.

287
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,783
You need to understand the situation.

288
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,786
They tampered with the airport cameras
in just two hours.

289
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,830
Isn't it obvious that some big shots
are behind those two?

290
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,209
Who are those big shots?

291
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,669
Why did they kill
all those innocent people?

292
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,798
Why did my nephew have to die? Why?

293
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,102
That's why we should go back to Seoul.
To find answers.

294
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,857
There's nothing we can do here.

295
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,693
And our life is under threat.

296
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,203
Your country has what it takes.

297
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,623
The NIS will be investigating the case,

298
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,126
so don't worry and come with me to Seoul.

299
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,191
No need to wait.

300
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,860
Who's taking charge?

301
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,736
I'll take it, sir.

302
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,364
Go Hae-ri is under my command.

303
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,699
I'll take it.

304
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,288
Six years ago, Mr. Gang worked
with the British MI6

305
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,249
and apprehended Abu Sayyaf,
a terrorist group.

306
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,961
-When it comes to terrorists, Mr. Gang--
-Min can take it.

307
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,256
Yes, sir.

308
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,010
Go's video must be
in the Inspection Team.

309
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,553
Let's check that first.

310
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,020
-What?
-It's not working.

311
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,864
What happened?

312
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,533
It's a virus.

313
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,994
How can you idiots
let a virus come through?

314
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,162
We're figuring it out.

315
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,289
I don't care. Just restore the video.

316
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,457
How long to restore?

317
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,375
An expert is coming.

318
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,045
We don't have time. Restore it today.

319
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,589
Min, keep this confidential.

320
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,341
Yes, sir.

321
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,524
Does that mean
I don't have to worry about the NIS?

322
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,029
By the way, when can I meet you?

323
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,157
Turning me down again?

324
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,494
You should treat me better.

325
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,747
Or else I may harm you--

326
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,422
Shadow.

327
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,218
I made it but it's a good nickname.

328
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,681
The way Shadow works
is just like a stealth jet.

329
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,349
Silent and precise.

330
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,477
I'll tell Dr. Kevin not to worry
about the NIS.

331
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,855
Tell him to conclude it quickly.

332
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,608
-Dynamic System's aircraft failure.
-Yes, ma'am.

333
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,405
Mr. Minister!

334
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,991
Who would have guessed?

335
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,453
I heard you're a great golfer.

336
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,915
Let's go for a round sometime.
I'll do my best to accompany you.

337
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,876
I don't fraternize
with defense contractors.

338
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,967
He's so stiff-necked.

339
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,845
Do you have the documents ready?

340
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,391
Lieutenant General Lim Pil-gyu,
Head of Policy Advisor for the MND.

341
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,560
He takes care of the F-X Plan business.

342
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,355
President Jang Dong-gyu
of the Institute for Defense Analysis.

343
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,940
He hosted the press conference.

344
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,570
Choi Sang-bae. He is the Policy Advisor
in the Ministry of National Defense.

345
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,532
These three are close aides
of Minister Park Man-yeong.

346
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,243
They're deeply involved in the F-X Plan.

347
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,790
Lim Pil-gyu was involved in corruption,
back when he was in Logistics Command.

348
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,669
Jang Dong-gyu received big money
for exempting military obligation

349
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,004
of an acquaintance's son.

350
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,630
When Choi was in service,

351
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,925
he was accused
of molesting a female officer.

352
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,095
Lim Pil-gyu's documents.

353
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,224
Send them to Jang.

354
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,727
Send Jang's documents to Choi.

355
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,272
And Choi's documents to Lim.

356
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,818
We need to think smarter
to trap Minister Park.

357
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,361
LIM PIL-GYU

358
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,325
There can only be one second-in-command.

359
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,619
So these three colleagues are also rivals.

360
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,041
MILITARY POLICE UNIT 1

361
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,125
PETITION

362
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,169
What can be more fun
than a rival's weakness?

363
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,963
Send them a call sign,

364
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,800
they will all come running.

365
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,938
What brings you here?

366
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,484
I'd like to ask the same.

367
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,989
So you all came.

368
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,410
Thank you very much
for accepting my invites.

369
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,038
Let them in.

370
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,628
Today's event is my treat for you,

371
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,213
so please enjoy.

372
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,675
What's the meaning of this?

373
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,219
Those who feel uncomfortable may leave.

374
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,681
But the rest of us
will have a serious discussion

375
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,767
about the one who leaves first.

376
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,912
What do you think you're doing?

377
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,320
Thank you for coming, Minister.

378
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,072
Where are they?

379
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,866
Come this way.

380
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,382
I whisper in your ears

381
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,718
And stay by your side

382
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:05,014
But I always feel so sad

383
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,810
Why can't you accept

384
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,980
My love

385
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,650
You are my Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

386
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,028
You make me feel sad

387
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,822
What the hell is this?

388
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:25,993
Mr. Minister.

389
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,161
Get out!

390
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,225
Damn it...

391
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,784
If I were you,

392
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,747
I would think this is a good time
for us to have a drink.

393
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:29,557
Do you think I will surrender
to your dirty threat?

394
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,684
Do you think it's a threat?

395
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,439
But I haven't asked you anything yet.

396
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,065
You picked the wrong fight.

397
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,651
You can't take over the F-X Plan.

398
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,612
One for corruption.

399
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,364
One for bribery.

400
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,575
One for sexual harassment.

401
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,744
You didn't know that, did you?

402
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,372
The top of the stream is clean,
yet the bottom is filthy.

403
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,586
The moment you choose Dynamic System,

404
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,630
what happened here
and your men's wrongdoings

405
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,132
will be released.

406
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,970
The public is already all worked up
after the plane crash.

407
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,057
How will you deal with all the criticism?

408
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,398
I feel bad.

409
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,651
It's not my intention
to pick a fight with you.

410
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:31,118
I know a lot of dirty secrets
in the US Department of Defense.

411
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,416
I also have some information
that the Blue House might like.

412
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,380
In other words,

413
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,176
I have a ton of gifts
I can offer you.

414
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,553
Are you offering a deal?

415
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,516
A deal built on trust is easily broken,

416
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,771
but a deal built on weakness
is hard to get rid of.

417
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,899
I don't know any of your weaknesses.

418
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,567
If so,

419
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,363
let's make one.

420
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,282
I think...

421
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,662
you could become a great weakness for me.

422
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,074
I told you we should hurry.

423
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,161
Happy now?
We missed the plane.

424
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,371
I can't even turn my own lights on.

425
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,250
This is why
you should have a good partner.

426
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,421
Aren't you eating?

427
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,922
I'll eat all of it.

428
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,632
Don't whine about it later--

429
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,510
If the NIS starts investigating,
will you take part?

430
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,597
That question sounds borderline insulting.

431
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,850
Of course, I will.
I'm the one who uncovered it all.

432
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,522
Why? Don't you trust me?

433
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,275
I'm a promising agent, you know.

434
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,110
Once I solve this case...

435
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,573
By the way,

436
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,617
do you have trust issues?

437
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,411
I can read people like an X-ray machine.

438
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,163
You are full of doubts.

439
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,875
Quick-tempered and feisty all the time.

440
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,293
How about you?

441
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,004
You struggled to trust me.

442
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,257
That's because of my job.
But you have a problem.

443
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:56,222
Still, that crooked personality of yours
got us somewhere.

444
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,938
No claps for me?

445
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,731
I dug up something big today.

446
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,030
How did you come to raise Hoon?

447
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,075
You don't seem like a kid person.

448
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,538
Go to sleep. I'll be on guard.

449
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,706
Excuse me, Mr. Civilian?

450
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,669
Guard duties
are not for civilians like you,

451
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,629
but for special agents like me.

452
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,382
Get some sleep. I'll protect you.

453
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,843
Go--

454
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,223
Protect me like this?

455
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,850
You'll stand no chance against him.

456
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,149
I was off guard that time.

457
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,777
The NIS pays me for a reason.

458
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,956
I don't sleep with any girl.
Suit yourself. I don't care.

459
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,423
Excuse me. You're not my type.

460
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,843
I like tall, intelligent
fair-skinned men.

461
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,388
What? Any girl?

462
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,890
Do you need medication?

463
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,851
You're seriously delusional.

464
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,270
Jesus.

465
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,526
Fine. Let's see who falls asleep first.

466
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,777
When you snore,

467
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,071
I'll be sticking this up your nose.

468
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,775
Could you please keep your head straight?

469
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,945
I'm sure they are watching us.

470
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,489
Isn't that man acting weird?

471
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,074
You're the weirdest here.

472
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,451
Just look at him.

473
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,994
Two o'clock.

474
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,373
I am looking at him.
That's what the shades are for.

475
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,459
This is why I can't work with amateurs.

476
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,260
You are right. That is so weird.

477
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,054
I'm sure they are having an affair.

478
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,098
Good instincts, Mr. Cha.

479
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,460
I am not a traitor.

480
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,213
I was trying to find the co-pilot

481
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,381
and take matters into my own hands.

482
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,559
If it wasn't for Cha Dal-geon,
I could've taken him out.

483
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:57,731
Samael will take care of
Cha Dal-geon and the co-pilot.

484
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:01,068
No. Let me do it.

485
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,572
This time, there will be no mistakes...

486
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,138
The NIS will take care of Go Hae-ri.

487
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,558
What about Cha Dal-geon?

488
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,853
Obstacles are meant to be removed.

489
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,479
We're already on thin ice.

490
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,567
Find out where Lily is.

491
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,362
-She should be in the US.
-Call her now.

492
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,073
No one here is more reliable than her.

493
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,809
Gosh, you should've called earlier.

494
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,064
I was about to go on a vacation
to Miami Beach tonight.

495
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,734
Right now?

496
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,909
I'll have my vacation in Korea.

497
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,703
In return,

498
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:22,501
book me a first-class ticket, please.

499
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,796
Me?

500
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,884
I beg you...

501
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,596
-Don't kill me.
-I'm working.

502
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,729
Are you certain, sir?

503
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,400
NIS DIRECTOR GENERAL
AN GI-DONG

504
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,984
I understand.

505
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:52,989
Yes, sir.

506
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,167
How strange.

507
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,336
He's like a ghost.

508
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,588
He's on the plane,

509
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,465
but not on the passenger list?

510
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,050
Is that possible?

511
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,635
Something is up.

512
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,807
Am I right?

513
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,937
Maybe they got the wrong guy.

514
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,647
Passenger lists are never wrong.

515
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,774
Two people saw the video.

516
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,110
It's not likely
that both of them are wrong.

517
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,654
Is there any chance
of restoring that video?

518
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,158
-No, sir.
-Who knows about this apart from Go?

519
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:40,036
The ones who sat in the meeting
and a few Inspection staff.

520
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,582
Drop the case.

521
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,753
-Sir.
-The video never existed.

522
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,715
Min, keep Go's mouth shut.
Gi, take care of your men.

523
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,133
I'll handle the chiefs.

524
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,469
Two hundred people died in the crash.

525
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,888
One hundred and eight of them,
our citizens!

526
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,473
Just because a video was lost--

527
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,391
Just do as you're told!

528
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,897
We just lost conclusive evidence
of a terrorist attack.

529
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,358
Do you think we'll be fine
if word gets out?

530
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,569
We will be as good as dead!

531
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,911
The ICAO will conclude
that the aircraft malfunctioned.

532
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,204
Let's just wait and see.

533
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,998
We can start investigating
if they suggest a terrorist attack.

534
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:33,089
Don't tell Go Hae-ri the details.
It's risky because she's a rookie.

535
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,217
Yes, sir.

536
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,227
I don't get it. There could--

537
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,771
Stop sticking your nose in.

538
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,357
Look at us. It was all for nothing.

539
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,568
You blew my shot at a promotion.

540
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,112
Is that all you care about, right now?

541
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,865
What did you say?

542
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,409
You may not give a shit

543
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,496
because your family is rich
and you lead a comfortable life,

544
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,915
but promotion matters to me.

545
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,877
Raising three kids
is not a joke, you know.

546
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,214
Gi Tae-ung.

547
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,425
I'm curious.

548
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,678
The video...

549
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,099
Don't you think
it was destroyed on purpose?

550
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,354
I mean, the timing is so perfect.

551
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:34,025
A video file is confiscated
after a security sweep,

552
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,902
and a virus destroys it.

553
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,738
The only image of the terrorist

554
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,991
is gone, just like that.

555
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,873
Are you saying that it was me?

556
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,461
Just saying.

557
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,424
Who cares now?

558
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,843
We are dropping it anyway.

559
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,420
DELETE

560
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,601
Welcome.

561
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,063
Wow.

562
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,984
I guess you made some money, Jessica.

563
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,156
But you look old now.

564
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,034
She's a CEO. Have some respect.

565
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,245
Come on, there's no need for respect
between us.

566
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,372
Am I right?

567
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,791
You haven't changed.
You're still a bitch.

568
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,460
A bitch employee for a bitch employer.

569
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,425
I'm a bit tired, so let's talk business.

570
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,346
Cha Dal-geon. He's a stuntman.

571
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,057
A stuntman?

572
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,185
Did a movie investment go bust?

573
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:36,314
B357. His family member was on it.

574
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,570
You will have to pay a big one.

575
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,741
A big one? That's not what we agreed on.

576
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,451
You didn't know.

577
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,872
I charge regular prices for bad guys,

578
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,166
but there's a premium for good guys.

579
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,960
Hey, Lily.

580
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,920
Follow-up service included.

581
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,463
I'll finish the job perfectly.

582
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,550
-If you keep this up--
-Take it or leave it.

583
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,803
I'll just take a tour of Korea instead.

584
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,890
I like places with a lot of tombs.

585
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,935
Gyeongju is the place!

586
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,311
No guns.

587
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,731
No poisoning, either.

588
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:23,069
I'm saying you should never leave
traces of murder.

589
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,578
Meet potassium chloride cocktail.

590
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:36,041
When this enters a body through the veins,
the heart cannot take it.

591
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,626
The autopsy report will say
it's a heart attack.

592
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:43,381
So you are planning to inject that
into Cha Dal-geon's neck?

593
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,925
Can you bell a cat?

594
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,556
Are you trying to insult me?

595
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,391
I'm Lily.

596
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,064
Ten percent in advance.
The rest when it's done.

597
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,276
I usually get half in advance.

598
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:14,287
So, where is our dear client right now?

599
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,844
I'll have it if you won't.

600
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,068
So your appetite is back?
You had nothing since yesterday.

601
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,754
Excuse me.

602
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,631
Could you...

603
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,425
Thank you.

604
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,221
This will make you feel better.

605
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,777
-Let me prick your finger.
-I'm fine.

606
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,822
Just do as I say and give me your hand.

607
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,202
God, your hand is so cold.

608
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,217
I know how you feel.

609
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,928
You blame yourself.

610
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,516
I felt the same when my dad died.

611
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,228
Blaming yourself makes you

612
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,147
sad and angry.

613
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:10,111
But we will get the terrorist,
thanks to you.

614
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,572
You can stop feeling sorry.

615
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,625
Jeez, look at that black blood.
It's worse than I thought.

616
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,676
-I'm sorry.
-You should watch where you are going.

617
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,679
Are you okay?

618
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,808
I'm sorry.

619
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,775
-Dal-geon, what's wrong?
-Let me see him.

620
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,694
-Dal-geon!
-Are you okay, sir?

621
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,196
Looks like a heart attack.
Call the ambulance!

622
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,826
This is an emergency.
Please send an ambulance.

623
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,495
Incheon Airport Arrival Hall. Hurry!

624
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,913
Dal-geon, wake up!

625
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,499
AMBULANCE

626
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,460
We'll pick him up

627
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,838
and inject the potassium chloride
into his veins.

628
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,260
And the bell's on the cat's neck.

629
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,180
What do you say?

630
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,974
He's coming.

631
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,273
We just arrived. Where are you?

632
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,610
Let's start.

633
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:09,540
-I'm sorry.
-You should watch where you are going.

634
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:38,653
Who are you?

635
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,280
Who the hell are you?

636
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,620
