1
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,957
ROK-US ALLIANCE 59TH ANNIVERSARY
HOSTED BY NATIONAL DEFENSE MINISTRY

2
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,767
It's been a while, Mr. Minister.

3
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,401
It's so hard to

4
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,570
get a hold of you.

5
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,448
You must be busy
with the bereaved families.

6
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,786
Soon, they will sign the agreement,

7
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,248
which will make your job a lot easier.

8
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,042
Some of them plan to sue Dynamic System.

9
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,755
That's why my salary is so high.
To prevent such a thing. Don't worry.

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,467
Why would I worry about you people?

11
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,429
People might misunderstand.

12
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,015
Please watch what you say.

13
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,859
It's won't be easy this time.

14
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,611
Even you...

15
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,780
can't turn the table.

16
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,534
Nothing is signed yet.

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,203
Want to bet?

18
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,913
I can bet anything on

19
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,166
where they'll sign.

20
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,170
What did you do to Minister Park?

21
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,673
Just a tiny bit
of what I've learned from you.

22
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,091
Haven't I taught you

23
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,137
that in our field,
you should never be certain.

24
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,724
The plane didn't crash alone.

25
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,183
You don't know?

26
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,937
The reputation you've built
in the business went down

27
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,356
to the bottom, too.

28
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,736
It's not too late
to give up the rebidding.

29
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,281
You don't want to go down deeper.

30
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,122
-Oh, General Bae!
-Oh, Jessica. Good to see you.

31
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,459
-You, too.
-I heard you scored big.

32
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,752
It's the talk of the town.

33
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,133
We just arrived. Where are you?

34
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,136
Let's start.

35
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,856
Ouch!

36
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,735
-I'm sorry.
-You should watch where you are going.

37
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,839
Who are you?

38
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,716
Who the hell are you?

39
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,802
What's wrong?

40
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,263
Plan B, now.

41
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,224
Open your fist.

42
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,227
Open your fucking fist!

43
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,646
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't move.

44
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,232
What?

45
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,692
Captain!

46
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,777
It's time to take off.

47
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,863
-You need to be in uniform.
-Gosh!

48
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,867
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

49
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,620
He's on medication for nervous breakdowns.

50
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,206
You!

51
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,292
Get out of there.

52
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,169
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

53
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,471
Stop being overdramatic.

54
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,599
Like you were in the Morocco airport.

55
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,146
Hae-ri Go!

56
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,317
Oh, my! How long has it been?

57
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,404
Hey. You look like you've had a good time.

58
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,822
Why you...

59
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,158
Oh, my. Mr. Cha Dal-geon?

60
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,203
Nice to meet you. I'm Gong Hwa-suk.
Hae-ri must've told you a lot about me.

61
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,538
No, she hasn't.

62
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,957
Oh, she hasn't. You are very direct.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,002
Must be hungry.
What do you want for lunch?

64
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,129
Kimchi stew with loads of pork.

65
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,173
What about you, Dal-geon?

66
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,215
I'm not hungry.

67
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,176
"Not hungry"...

68
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,470
Let's get to my car first.

69
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,929
Let's go.

70
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,978
What the hell happened in Morocco?
Tell me. I want to know.

71
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:59,108
Where do I start?
I almost died and became a virgin ghost.

72
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,695
Yeah, right.
Lose the word "virgin" from that sentence.

73
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,405
Quiet!

74
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,414
Nice plan.

75
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,209
-Are you mocking me?
-Plan B.

76
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,797
The prey hasn't noticed yet.
You'll get your chance soon.

77
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,384
He's a stuntman, right?

78
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,764
What a nice little challenge he is.

79
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,479
It's good. Eat up.

80
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,857
-Did you bring what I asked?
-What?

81
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,193
Oh, that?

82
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,529
It's so strange.

83
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:50,660
There's no record of their jobs,
financial transactions, and calls.

84
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,661
What do you mean?

85
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,623
What about Kim Ho-sik who died in Morocco
and the co-pilot?

86
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,335
Yes, those two. There's nothing left
but their basic information.

87
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,256
Is the NIS that incompetent?

88
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,049
It's not that we can't...

89
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,927
Never mind.

90
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,847
Maybe somebody cleaned it up
before we got to it.

91
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,182
That's what I think, too.
We need to look into it.

92
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,770
Let's eat first.

93
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,316
What about the terrorist from the video?

94
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,568
Actually...

95
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,488
...there is a slight problem,
so it'll take a while.

96
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,073
What? What problem?

97
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,409
Gosh, what are you doing?

98
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,078
Are you interrogating me?

99
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,000
Does he always look this scary?

100
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,501
You'll get used to it.

101
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,836
Eat.

102
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,009
HOON'S MOM

103
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,858
-I am curious.
-About what?

104
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,111
There must be a reason to crash the plane,

105
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,490
but I can't think of any.

106
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,827
I heard what happened to Hoon afterward,

107
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,954
and couldn't sleep for days.

108
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,874
I can't believe it.

109
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,920
Do you know
the families are gathering tonight?

110
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:29,008
If you don't want to go, I can go instead.

111
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,178
Hello?

112
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,804
I'm listening.

113
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,434
They're going to talk about compensation.

114
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,020
Do you know anything about it?

115
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,815
You said you weren't his mom anymore.

116
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,734
Don't get me wrong.

117
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,987
I'm not doing this because of the money.

118
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,198
Do you know how much he missed you?

119
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,701
You never visited him
after abandoning him at the orphanage,

120
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,870
and now you want to be his mom?

121
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,122
Dal-geon.

122
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,668
It's not my business where you go,

123
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,962
but stay out of my sight.

124
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,966
Otherwise, I might destroy
your precious house...

125
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,886
...which you love more than Hoon.

126
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,763
Alright?

127
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,854
Damn it.

128
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,819
Mr. Cha Dal-geon?

129
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,822
How do you do?

130
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm Jo Bu-yeong,
a reporter for Pyeonghwa Daily.

131
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,580
-So?
-Well...

132
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,457
I heard from the families
while interviewing them

133
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,961
that you claimed
the plane was attacked by a terrorist.

134
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,755
PYEONGHWA DAILY
JO BU-YEONG

135
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,341
What do you want?

136
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,513
The day before the accident,

137
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,641
the airport police got a call
about the terrorist attack.

138
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,272
Unfortunately, a fire broke out
in the control room at the same time.

139
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,735
Hello?
I just received a suspicious phone call.

140
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,237
There will be a terrorist attack on...

141
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,368
And the officer who got the call
lost consciousness out of the blue.

142
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,371
She's been brain-dead ever since,

143
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,500
but for some reason the police
is doing nothing and blocking the press.

144
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,253
Something's fishy, isn't it?

145
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,467
Strange things have happened to me, too.

146
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,968
That's why...

147
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,347
...I came to see you.

148
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:44,310
Can you tell me what happened in Morocco?

149
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,608
Mr. Cha, this case
has a very complicated background.

150
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,694
We need to find
as much evidence as possible

151
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,197
and put them all together

152
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,532
to see a clearer picture of the truth.

153
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,409
I need your help.

154
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,124
I'll do anything I can.

155
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,838
However, you can't tell anything
to the NIS people.

156
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,592
-What?
-The ladies you're with.

157
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,885
Aren't they with the NIS?

158
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,931
-Yes, but how do--
-Don't trust them.

159
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,227
With a reporter's gut and experience,
I'm telling you.

160
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,813
You can't trust anyone,

161
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,940
not even from law enforcement.

162
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,401
Cha Dal-geon!

163
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,820
That coffee shop down the street.
See you there.

164
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,325
Who is he?

165
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,161
Nobody. He asked directions.

166
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,373
How kind of you to take this long
to show him--

167
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,250
If we're done here, let's split.

168
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,918
Are you going home?

169
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,672
Let's go together.
You can't be too careful even in Korea.

170
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,425
I'll be glad
if those bastards try to mess with me.

171
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,676
Call me.

172
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,096
What a tough guy.

173
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,182
You two seem close.

174
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,478
Is it love born out of war
like Doctor Zhivago?

175
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,398
His way of talking,
personality, and attitude.

176
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,233
Everything is perfect.

177
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,069
Wow, that's deep.

178
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,320
Yes.

179
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,908
Unbelievably and perfectly
not to my liking at all.

180
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,661
Every single little thing about him
isn't my thing.

181
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,122
Really? I didn't know.

182
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,457
Let's leave him, then.

183
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,089
Hold on. Pull over.

184
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,842
What's wrong?

185
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,934
He's way too kind.

186
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,437
Drinking coffee with him
to show directions?

187
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,195
You surely did go through
a series of bizarre things in Morocco.

188
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,238
It doesn't add up at all.

189
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,033
Who'd do such a terrible thing?

190
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,952
I think it's got to do with
the fighter bidding.

191
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,665
"The fighter bidding"?

192
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:20,007
The government has
a 10-billion-dollar fighter plan.

193
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,968
And the one that benefits the most
from this tragedy is...

194
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,846
John &amp; Mark.

195
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:31,018
The strong candidate,
Dynamic is rumored to lose.

196
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,479
Then...

197
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,731
...everything that happened...

198
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,068
...was planned by John &amp; Mark or whatever?

199
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,694
The question isn't about who,

200
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,404
but why.

201
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,867
However, it's only my speculation,
so it can be wrong.

202
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,954
I will know more
when I meet the informant.

203
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,164
"Informant"?

204
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,709
As a matter of fact,
I'm going to meet someone

205
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,045
to learn more about the plane crash.

206
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,423
He has very important evidence
about the terrorist,

207
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,716
like you do.

208
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,428
Who is this informant?

209
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,346
Excuse me.

210
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,685
Yes, this is Jo speaking.

211
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,104
Oh, okay.

212
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,855
Alright. I can be there on time.

213
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,691
I will see you there.

214
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,987
Can I go with you?

215
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,241
I'm not sure.
He's very cautious about being exposed.

216
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,921
-Go after them.
-Really? Are you sure? Okay, then.

217
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,144
What kind of situation is this?

218
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,564
Why are those two men going into a motel?

219
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,526
I'm here.

220
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,363
Room 407?

221
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,408
I'm here alone. Don't worry.

222
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,161
I'll come right up.

223
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,581
Well, he is very anxious.

224
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,003
You go ahead and call me when it's okay.

225
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,673
Good idea. I'll call you soon.

226
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,882
Okay?

227
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,907
Jeez, it's been 30 minutes already.

228
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,995
What are we doing here
while two men are in there?

229
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,038
Let's wait a bit more.

230
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,957
Wait for what?

231
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,959
Want to see how intimate they are?

232
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,713
I see why you and Cha are not compatible.

233
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,841
He doesn't seem to lean towards that side.

234
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,642
The person you're trying to reach...

235
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,103
Mr. Jo?

236
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,112
Mr. Jo?

237
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,995
No!

238
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,208
Mr. Jo! What happened? Who did this?

239
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,255
Oh, no. Mr. Jo.

240
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,132
Mr. Jo... Mr. Jo!

241
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,634
Shit.

242
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,470
Shit.

243
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,478
Yes, someone is dying.

244
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,022
I think he's been stabbed.

245
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,151
The address is...
It's an unattended motel in Sinwon-dong.

246
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,277
It's called...

247
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,947
Yes, that's right. Come as quick--

248
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,112
Dal-geon!

249
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,619
-Chase that bike!
-What?

250
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,371
-Chase him!
-Chase him?

251
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,504
-Drive faster!
-Okay, gosh!

252
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,760
Just pass it through. Just go!

253
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,434
Why didn't you go?
You're a terrible driver!

254
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,227
Are you crazy?

255
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,605
If an accident occurred,
who'd be responsible?

256
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,440
Who is he?

257
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,317
Tell me what's going on.

258
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,653
There was a homicide.

259
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,238
"Homicide"?

260
00:19:59,031 --> 00:19:59,865
Who is the victim?

261
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,451
A reporter for Pyeonghwa Daily.

262
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,579
He was following up
on a story of the crash

263
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,040
and came to meet an informant...

264
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,755
-Let's go back to the motel.
-What?

265
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,839
Jeez.

266
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,758
Gosh, what the heck is going on?

267
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,891
You got a call, right?

268
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,518
-Yes, about a homicide.
-I was the caller.

269
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,603
Follow me, please.

270
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,565
Hurry.

271
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,865
Here...

272
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,575
What?

273
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,161
There's no one here.

274
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,790
-What's going on? There's no one.
-What?

275
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,668
What is this?

276
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,544
You said someone was killed.

277
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,838
Is this the right room?

278
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,757
Maybe a different one?

279
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,717
He was right here.

280
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,553
-Bleeding heavily.
-Are you messing with us?

281
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,934
You think I'm messing with you?

282
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,313
This card belongs to the victim.

283
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,359
And also, I have his--

284
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,195
I'm with the NIS.

285
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,322
The NIS?

286
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,658
Hwa-suk, show them your ID.

287
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,910
I don't have it.

288
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,997
-You don't?
-Who carries around an ID these days?

289
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,335
Anyway, we saw him coming here
with the reporter.

290
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,130
Check his ID with the newspaper
and check the CCTVs.

291
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,758
Also, call the Crime Scene Unit
for a Luminol test.

292
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,554
Go and check the CCTVs.

293
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,431
Okay.

294
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,184
"Jo Bu-yeong"...

295
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,985
I'm looking for Jo Bu-yeong,
a city desk reporter.

296
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,153
I can't reach him.

297
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,030
Excuse me?

298
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,823
On vacation?

299
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,951
Alright, I see.

300
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,661
No, it's nothing.

301
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,038
Sure.

302
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,916
He went on a vacation to New Zealand.

303
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,672
I'm telling you he's dead.

304
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,760
Those bastards disposed of his body!

305
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,348
I checked the CCTVs,
but no one checked in here.

306
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,978
Excuse me, officer.

307
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,482
Sir.

308
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,109
I'm going to let it pass this time.

309
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,614
But if this happens again, you'll be
charged with obstruction of justice.

310
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,865
Got it?

311
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,117
Let's go.

312
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,917
What on earth is going on?

313
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,338
I can't decide
whether to believe him or not.

314
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,006
I believe him.

315
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,301
You do?

316
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,471
Things like this also happened in Morocco.

317
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,183
We don't need the police.
We'll find out ourselves.

318
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,606
I almost forgot.

319
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,486
What is this?

320
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,071
Jo gave me this before he died.

321
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,411
This is a flash drive.

322
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,123
Plug it in over there.

323
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,255
Doesn't it work?

324
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,382
Doesn't fit. The connector is destroyed.

325
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,760
-What if the data is destroyed, too?
-I'm not sure.

326
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,346
-Let's go to my place, first.
-Okay.

327
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,597
You two go ahead.

328
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,015
I'll catch up.

329
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,392
Where are you going?

330
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,194
You did well.

331
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,488
Next up is...

332
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,617
Mr. Park Kwang-deok,
would you like to try?

333
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,163
Me? Well...

334
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,373
Maybe later.

335
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,333
We're here

336
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,461
to heal your emotional scars.

337
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,133
You can speak freely
whatever comes to your mind.

338
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,937
KEEP YOUR PROMISE, MR. PRESIDENT!
THE GOVERNMENT MUST REVEAL THE TRUTH.

339
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,415
Honey,

340
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,251
do you remember?

341
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,338
As we couldn't have a wedding,

342
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,090
I bought you a gold ring instead.

343
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,302
But you were mad,

344
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,723
so I stupidly refunded it.

345
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,435
I should've put it on your finger.

346
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,397
I don't know what to do.

347
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,401
Because towards you and...

348
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,073
...our baby in your belly,

349
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,201
I feel so guilty.

350
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,786
I am so sorry.

351
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,081
How can I go on?

352
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,167
I miss you, Mi-seon.

353
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,925
I'm sorry.

354
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,346
REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE BEREAVED FAMILIES

355
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,489
What a surprise
to see you working so hard.

356
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,909
Solving this may be my ticket
to a transfer back to Korea.

357
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,744
Not only that!

358
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,581
You can be promoted by not one,
but two ranks.

359
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,334
I'll ask for a different position
like a desk job

360
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,628
where I can stay long and safe.

361
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,965
Wow, you have your own angle for this.

362
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:36,928
Because of your loyalty to Chief Gang,
you've been on the bad side of Chief Min.

363
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,058
I hope it works.

364
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,898
Alright!

365
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,903
What are these?

366
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,366
Information about Kim Woo-gi.

367
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,201
The co-pilot of the B357.

368
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,455
I couldn't find it anywhere

369
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,999
and now here it is.

370
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,468
Making breakfast for you
wasn't a big deal,

371
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,054
but why was I grumpy about it?

372
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,141
Leaving socks everywhere
wasn't a big deal, either.

373
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,311
I regret it every day, honey.

374
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,898
That morning, too...

375
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,154
I can't. I can't do it anymore.

376
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,198
It's okay, Ms. O Sang-mi.

377
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,783
ORDINARY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE

378
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,618
No pressure. Take your time.

379
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:42,994
What do you have?

380
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,455
Kim Woo-gi's life insurance policies
are worth...

381
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,375
nearly 5 billion Won.

382
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,794
He bought them six months ago,

383
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,420
and the beneficiary is...

384
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,298
his wife.

385
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,385
O Sang-mi might be an accomplice.

386
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,721
They owed loan sharks over 1 billion Won

387
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,932
but still paid 10 million
as a monthly premium

388
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,892
by taking out a bank loan.

389
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,895
Hello?

390
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,064
Dal-geon, are you there?

391
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,361
-Thank you for your service.
-Thank you.

392
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,446
Thank you.

393
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,785
Thank you
for giving us such a good opportunity.

394
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,079
I hope it helped.

395
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:30,625
I heard a lot about you from Ms. O.
You're an international lawyer, right?

396
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,920
-Let me give you my card.
-Oh...

397
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,465
Where's Kim Woo-gi?

398
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,639
What do you mean?

399
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,307
You know your husband...

400
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,601
Kim Woo-gi is alive.

401
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,526
What? What's wrong with you again?

402
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,153
Hey, Mr. Cha!

403
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,612
Where is that bastard?

404
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,657
Are you crazy?
What are you doing to our representative?

405
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,992
"Our representative"?

406
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,036
Is she representing the families?

407
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,790
Get out.
You don't deserve our group. Get out!

408
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,877
Get off me!
You're his accomplice, aren't you?

409
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,670
Where's Kim Woo-gi?

410
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,969
He's way out of line. Enough is enough!

411
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,345
Dal-geon...

412
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,014
-What? What is it?
-Can someone...

413
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,807
Dal-geon?
Kwang-deok, this is serious.

414
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,394
Oh, no! Dal-geon! Dal-geon, wake up!

415
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,229
Hurry up and call 911!

416
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,275
But we have to save this man!
Dal-geon!

417
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,651
Dal-geon, wake up!

418
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,488
-The ambulance is coming soon.
-I specialize in judo, so...

419
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,114
What's going on?

420
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,408
He passed out.

421
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,827
I threw him
for being such a pain in the ass.

422
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,038
We need...

423
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,306
Shit!

424
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,975
Are you okay?

425
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,685
I'm Micky.

426
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,437
I believe you know me.

427
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,523
Where are we going?

428
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,275
Mr. Edward Park
wanted you to see a doctor.

429
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,277
I don't need a doctor.

430
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,446
Where is he now?

431
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,740
He's busy.

432
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,116
Why do you ask?

433
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,453
Tell him I found the culprit

434
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,205
who crashed the plane.

435
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,667
For now,

436
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,586
you'd better come to our office.

437
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,716
ORDINARY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE

438
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,427
Let us handle the case

439
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,763
against Dynamic System.

440
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,266
Trials might take a year,

441
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,602
maybe over 10 years,
regardless of the result.

442
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,022
And the cost will be enormous.

443
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,068
Don't worry about the cost.

444
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:06,239
You can pay us when we win.

445
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,909
The pain you will face during the trials

446
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,453
can be unbearable.

447
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,205
That's right.

448
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,124
Trials might take long

449
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,585
while settling and getting compensation
will be quick.

450
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:19,919
However...

451
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,716
What would you do with your guilt
for the loved ones who are gone?

452
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,886
The pain you might face
during the trials...

453
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,264
wouldn't be heavier than the guilt.

454
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,975
Somebody told me

455
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,185
the moment of decision

456
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,439
reveals the true self.

457
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,318
Whether you file a complaint
or settle with them,

458
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,528
it's up to you.

459
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,866
Why do we have to make that decision?

460
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,785
We'd rather not
make this kind of decision.

461
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,121
Oh, God...

462
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,334
You can say goodbye
to a settlement agreement.

463
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,379
It never occurred to me
you'd take their case.

464
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,507
Nice move.

465
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,137
You used to be my hero,
but now you can't even read my moves.

466
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,140
You'd better retire.

467
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,329
Yes?

468
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,374
Well, do you like the equipment?

469
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,876
Everything is perfect here.

470
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,546
Cha Dal-geon has started to run his mouth
to the grieving families.

471
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,840
Get rid of him
before things get complicated.

472
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,551
I'm setting a stage.

473
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,096
You can't leave any trace of murder.

474
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,014
Come on.

475
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,017
You talk too much.

476
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,812
No wonder you're a lawyer.

477
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:06,109
When I'm done, I expect a heavy bonus

478
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,029
because my boys are heavy eaters.

479
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,079
Yo! Stop fucking eating and...

480
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,040
find out where he is.

481
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,336
"JM Pacific".

482
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,257
It's the airline
Kim Woo-gi used to work for

483
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,675
and it belongs to John &amp; Mark.

484
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,094
O Sang-mi was a flight attendant there.

485
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,224
So when Kim Woo-gi
was in financial trouble,

486
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,435
this Jessica woman recruited him?

487
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,354
Yes, everything seems to point that way.

488
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,481
I'm sorry, Dal-geon.

489
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,776
I should've believed you back in Morocco.

490
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,533
I didn't know Jessica would be
as corrupt as this.

491
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,618
Do you know her well?

492
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,621
Her recruiter and mentor in this field...

493
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,498
was me.

494
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,419
For her,
the end always justified the means.

495
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,047
She grew dangerously ambitious

496
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,383
and eventually betrayed me
to go to John &amp; Mark.

497
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,594
It's my fault.

498
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,804
I should've been more careful with her.

499
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,807
I really don't understand.

500
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,185
For this fighter plan thing,

501
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,979
they killed even civilians.

502
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,566
Is this normal in that business of yours?

503
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,405
A few years ago, hundreds of civilians
were killed in Chechnya

504
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,200
and John &amp; Mark was in it, too.

505
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,036
It's top secret.

506
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,914
The US government
was wary of the world's reaction,

507
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,290
so they redacted the record.

508
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:49,629
Do you happen to have connections
with the Portugal police?

509
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,217
Why do you ask?

510
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,221
The vice president of John &amp; Mark
killed himself in Portugal

511
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,349
on the day before the plane crash.

512
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:38,261
Something isn't right.
He's not a suicidal type at all.

513
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,558
What if he didn't get on with the plan
to crash the plane?

514
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,518
Isn't it possible

515
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,938
they killed him
and made it look like a suicide?

516
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,565
Yes, that's possible.

517
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,151
I have a friend
in the Portuguese intelligence service.

518
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,485
I'll have him look into it.

519
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,991
By the way, when you leave here,
do you intend to go back home?

520
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,951
Obviously, where else?

521
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,080
I have a place nearby

522
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:10,168
and I want you to use it
as a safe house for the time being.

523
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,045
Wow, now I'm frightened.

524
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,007
What about you?
What happened to your "long and safe"?

525
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,929
Hello?

526
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,764
Right now?

527
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,767
I need to go to the office now.

528
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,187
Call me when you're done.

529
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,147
I don't think I can make it tonight.

530
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,191
-See you later.
-Sure.

531
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,358
Bye.

532
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,537
It won't be uncomfortable for a few days.

533
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,081
If you need anything,

534
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,083
contact my secretary.

535
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,044
See you later.

536
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,925
Edward Park,

537
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,635
long time no see.

538
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,137
Do you know him?

539
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,474
He could've been my client,

540
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,808
but I said no.

541
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,394
He's a real son of a bitch.

542
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,506
Those people...

543
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,466
They are terrifying...

544
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,926
Mr. Kim!

545
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,344
Mr. Jo... Mr. Jo!

546
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,611
Your sister is on a huge case.

547
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:05,032
If I solve this, I can be back
to the headquarters and promoted.

548
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,494
Don't tell mom I'm here in Seoul.

549
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,373
Because it drives me nuts
that she always asks me for money.

550
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,627
I've got to go. Okay.

551
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,301
-How's it going with your report?
-I told you I'm smart.

552
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,803
The NIS will be shocked when they read it.

553
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,596
GOD OF WAR

554
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,561
Wow, I didn't know you were a god.

555
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,521
A god of war to boot.

556
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,278
You wanted to be a martial arts director?

557
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,741
Start acting again.
It was what Hoon wanted.

558
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,415
Oh, sorry. Maybe I stepped out of line.

559
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,420
It's just that I remembered
what Hoon said in the video.

560
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,922
Do you want some ramen?

561
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,924
I make a mean ramen.

562
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,052
I'm okay.

563
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,888
You should rest. You must be tired.

564
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,151
Thank you.

565
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,781
For remembering Hoon.

566
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,342
JOHN &amp; MARK

567
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,939
WILL JOHN &amp; MARK'S NEXT GENERATION
FIGHTER PROJECT BE THE FINAL WINNER?

568
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,278
JOHN &amp; MARK'S F-X PROJECT
WAS SELECTED AS THE...

569
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,573
WILL DYNAMIC SYSTEM
SURPASS JOHN &amp; MARK?

570
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,825
B-357 CRASH BECOMES NEW VARIABLE
IN FUTURE OF F-X PROJECT

571
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,955
CIVIL ORGANIZATIONS DEMAND
DYNAMIC SYSTEM GIVES UP THE BID

572
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,544
CHARITY CONCERT
HOSTED BY JOHN &amp; MARK

573
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,424
THE CONCERT WILL BE AT 3 P.M.
AT HANGANG HOSPITAL

574
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,768
I'm afraid I'm late.

575
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,229
-Is Mr. O here?
-Yes, he is.

576
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,106
-Okay.
-He's being very difficult.

577
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,734
That's what he does
as the opposition leader.

578
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,073
I'm sorry.
The civil liberty ceremony finished late.

579
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,034
Do something about the atmosphere here,
Prime Minister Hong.

580
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,911
It's been a while since I met Mr. O,

581
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,164
but he's being too difficult.

582
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,876
Senior Secretary Yun,
we need alcohol, not tea.

583
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,629
Dear Mr. O is known
for being a heavy drinker.

584
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,506
Forgive me.

585
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,760
My party's stance on the F-X plan
will not change.

586
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,971
We don't understand

587
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,725
why you have to choose John &amp; Mark
and pay them 1 trillion won more.

588
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,354
Explain to him, Minister Park.

589
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,232
Why is John &amp; Mark
your one and only choice?

590
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,527
Because its technology is worth its price.

591
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,196
Oh, simple.

592
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,364
Would this answer suffice?

593
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,117
According to the experts' opinion
we acquired,

594
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,245
Dynamic System's F70

595
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,498
is cheaper and superior.

596
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,791
In the test
of the National Defense Ministry,

597
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,462
John &amp; Mark's Eagle Fighter
received a higher score.

598
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,508
Anyway, the opposition parties

599
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,760
won't agree on the supplementary budget.

600
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:58,516
You must be well aware of
what the public think about Dynamic

601
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,559
after the plane crash.

602
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,354
Think about
the next presidential election.

603
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,649
You have no business worrying about that.

604
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,943
It's totally ours.

605
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,446
You must know, Mr. O.

606
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,449
My first priority during my term
at the Blue House

607
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,243
is independent national defense.

608
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,663
"Jeong Gook-pyo is definitely
King Sejong the Great

609
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:25,834
of national defense
above all the other presidents."

610
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,254
That's what I want to hear.

611
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,551
You know my creed.

612
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,844
Honesty and non-possession.

613
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,474
Except for completing the long-range plan
of our national defense,

614
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,143
I have no ulterior motive,
not even this much.

615
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,148
Please work with us.

616
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,197
Getting a supplementary budget
won't be easy.

617
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,492
Sons of bitches.

618
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,329
It's like they have one agenda,
complaining about anything and everything.

619
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,957
Those bastards of the opposition parties.

620
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,586
I will get to them one by one.

621
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,505
We can solve it step by step.

622
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,257
Don't be too anxious.

623
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,595
What's the secret
for taming Minister Park?

624
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,306
He's a changed man now.

625
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,728
Do you want to know?

626
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:29,315
I hope you didn't share with him
something you shouldn't.

627
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,862
Enjoy these when you're bored.

628
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,780
-For your eyes only.
-Are you leaving?

629
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,906
Yes.

630
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,758
How did he get these?

631
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,971
He's surely gifted in a peculiar way.

632
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,936
-It's been a while.
-How have you been?

633
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,188
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

634
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,357
Hello.

635
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,359
Hello. Oh, no.

636
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:16,945
Shoot!

637
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,075
Shit.

638
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,785
Hae-ri!

639
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,414
Didn't you apologize to Mr. Gi
for that incident?

640
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,876
How could I?
I've been too embarrassed to call him.

641
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,588
Are you stupid?
You'll run into him sooner or later.

642
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,173
I don't want to think about it.

643
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,592
You were the perpetrator,
and Gi was the victim.

644
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,177
You can't keep avoiding him.

645
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,096
-Okay?
-I don't want to hear it.

646
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,391
-I don't want to hear it.
-Don't want to hear what?

647
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,309
You, Gi Tae-ung!

648
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,236
Can't you hear me?

649
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:02,408
I said I was transferred overseas.

650
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,869
Far, far away to nowhere in Africa!

651
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,246
She's drunk.

652
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,165
What's wrong with her now?

653
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,085
So what? What do you want to say?

654
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,921
You are...

655
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,382
mine.

656
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,595
What?

657
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,806
Gi Tae-ung is mine,

658
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,601
so he's off-limits to anyone.
I won't allow it.

659
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,686
Is that understood?

660
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:32,813
Hwa-suk!

661
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,984
You're mine.

662
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,946
-You're mine.
-Do something now. Get her off.

663
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,407
-Mine!
-Girl, are you insanely drunk?

664
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,452
Sorry. Let's go home now. Let's go.

665
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,090
What the...

666
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,058
Mine.

667
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:21,528
Girl, if it wasn't for me,

668
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,947
Gi would've beaten you to death.

669
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,491
Where's the torture room?

670
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,494
I need to be tortured by electricity
to get my memory erased.

671
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,079
Where is it? Where?

672
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,082
He's coming this way.

673
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,376
Stay if you want to keep your job.

674
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,139
Hi, Mr. Gi. Good morning.

675
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,939
It's been a while, Mr. Gi.

676
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,819
I got back from Morocco
the day before yesterday.

677
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,365
-Congratulations on your transfer--
-Do you still drink?

678
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,536
-Not any more, Sir.
-I wouldn't have sent you overseas.

679
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,748
You're right.

680
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,252
-I had such a hard time there.
-I'd have just fired you.

681
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,798
An agent who drinks herself to oblivion...

682
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,425
isn't qualified.

683
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,682
What the...

684
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,142
Wow, he can freeze the whole office.

685
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,729
Are you okay?

686
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,899
I'm good.

687
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,985
With my report today,

688
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,945
his arrogant attitude will change.

689
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,240
You're right. The NIS will go berserk.

690
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:52,244
I'll totally ignore any transfer offer
from the Inspection Team.

691
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,498
I can't pamper her anymore.
She's driving me nuts.

692
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,791
Where are you going?

693
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,004
Yes?

694
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,172
Yes, Sir.

695
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,174
Was it Chief?

696
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,802
He must've read the report.
He sounds so happy.

697
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,304
One moment.

698
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,014
Go Hae-ri, good luck.

699
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,939
What? You got something to say?

700
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,068
Tell me why

701
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,154
we won't investigate.

702
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,824
First, there's insufficient evidence.

703
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,576
There are plenty of them.

704
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:36,163
I checked the phone conversation
between Kim Woo-gi and the terrorist.

705
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,582
Jo Bu-yeong, a reporter
for Pyeonghwa Daily--

706
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,710
Second, there aren't enough links
with John &amp; Mark.

707
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,464
I'm not sure
if you read the report thoroughly.

708
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,925
Third, if John &amp; Mark tries to sue us,

709
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,802
it'd be an international embarrassment.

710
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,765
The death toll is 211.
It's not the time to think about that!

711
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,183
Fourth,

712
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,311
I've got nowhere to go if I lose this job.

713
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,605
-Sir!
-Shut up!

714
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,454
I will directly report to the Director.

715
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,122
It's his order.

716
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:21,958
I beg your pardon?

717
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,170
It's the Director's direct order.

718
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,715
You'll be assigned to a different country.

719
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,344
Till then, make Cha Dal-geon
behave himself. You may go now.

720
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,558
Give me back the video evidence.

721
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,187
Why are you asking me?
Check with the Inspection Team.

722
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,565
You didn't even watch it?

723
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,069
I'm warning you.

724
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,530
If you ever open your mouth about it,

725
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,490
you'll be fired.

726
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,117
Keep that in mind.

727
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,119
Why do you hate so much having me here?

728
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,870
Get the hell out!

729
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,463
Hae-ri.

730
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,421
Drinking alone in daytime means
you have an alcohol problem.

731
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,715
I can't agree with
the Director's decision.

732
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,842
So what?

733
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,096
-What can you do about it?
-If Go Hae-ri is telling the truth...

734
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,640
we're neglecting our duty.

735
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,476
Don't you feel

736
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,603
ashamed of yourself?

737
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,820
Do you still think
we're the intelligence service?

738
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,782
Since the day Director An came,

739
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,826
we've become errand boys
for the Blue House.

740
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,329
Do you know what I do?

741
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,208
Replying to postings that criticize
the President and the government

742
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,626
with nothing but lies.

743
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,299
Kiss the Director's ass like Min Jae-sik.

744
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:38,720
Or settle to a shitty job like me
for a paycheck.

745
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,809
I can do neither of them,

746
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,852
so I should quit.

747
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,344
-Hello?
-It's Park Kwang-deok.

748
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,597
-Who?
-I'm sorry about the other day.

749
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,849
Are you hurt or anything?

750
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,476
No. I'm fine.

751
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,021
Let's have lunch together. My treat.
Where are you now?

752
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,440
You don't have to.

753
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,236
I'm not mad.

754
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,656
I said I was not mad, for Pete's sake!

755
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,241
Jeez.

756
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,118
Lunch?

757
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,704
Okay, I'll see you in 30 minutes.

758
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,002
Our guest is going out.
Get the party ready.

759
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,893
Get the radio frequency.

760
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,402
I'm sorry about yesterday.

761
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,531
Let's not talk about it.
It's embarrassing.

762
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,825
As a martial artist,
I shouldn't have used force.

763
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,785
Can you cut it out already?

764
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,248
You said you need to be somewhere
around 3 o'clock.

765
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,292
Let's go near that place, then. Where to?

766
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,669
-Just go straight ahead.
-Alright.

767
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,049
Not yet?

768
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,884
It's on.

769
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,938
-Uh, what's wrong with this?
-Hit the brake now!

770
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,898
I, I am hitting it.

771
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,118
Hold on. What... What's wrong?

772
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:11,581
-I don't get it. It's a new car!
-Calm down. Take it easy.

773
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,958
Oh, no!

774
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:27,389
-I'll drive. Move to the backseat.
-Are you crazy? I can't switch seats now!

775
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,265
I'm a stuntman! Do as I say!

776
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,559
-Hold on. Grab the wheel.
-Go now!

777
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,687
Grab it! Oh, no!

778
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,732
What...

779
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,360
Oh, no! Car, car! Whoa.

780
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,655
-Hold on tight.
-It's still a red light.

781
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,866
Don't you know
the program won't work in distance?

782
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,161
What the fuck is wrong with it?

783
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,256
That car keeps following us,
ignoring the lights.

784
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,886
-It's them trying to kill me.
-What? What did you say?

785
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,223
I told you it was an act of terrorism!
They're one of them!

786
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,141
Damn it.

787
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,355
SMALL HEART CONCERT
FOR CHILDREN WITH RARE DISEASES

788
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,775
As baby's breaths are beautiful

789
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:24,696
When together

790
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:31,494
Let's get together
And gently embrace each other

791
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,707
Into each small heart

792
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:39,544
Plant tender love

793
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,673
And let's make together

794
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:47,302
A beautiful world!

795
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,102
Shit!

796
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,272
The phone's not working, either!
We can really die here!

797
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:04,402
Oh, Dal-geon! People! Oh no!

798
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,154
Quickly! People!

799
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,157
Jeez. What the...

800
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,166
Watch out!

801
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,595
Careful!

802
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,597
You get out of the way!

803
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:43,775
God! No!

804
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,490
-Hold on!
-Damn it!

805
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,968
Do you know
who's the hardest to deal with?

806
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,473
Lucky sons of bitches.

807
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,992
What's going on? Tell me in full detail.

808
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,664
-You said you didn't believe me?
-No, I'll believe everything you say.

809
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,208
I believe you, okay?

810
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,673
FUND FOR TREATING CHILDREN
WITH RARE DISEASES

811
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,179
SMALL HEART CONCERT
FOR CHILDREN WITH RARE DISEASES

812
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,352
Thank you.

813
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:48,107
John &amp; Mark donates to
many other organizations as well.

814
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,860
Could it be to sweeten the F-X deal?

815
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:55,323
We don't want our good deeds to be known.
Please don't write about it.

816
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,824
What about an interview?

817
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,661
-Could you answer one question?
-I'm sorry.

818
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,578
I'm sorry.

819
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,347
Damn.

820
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,926
