1
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,498
-Where are you?
-We're smuggling ourselves on a ship.

2
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,333
Give me the time and place
of your arrival.

3
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,918
On the 15th, at 9 a.m.

4
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:30,632
We'll be disembarking at Terminal No. 1.
The container number is KHCH 35679-19.

5
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,760
You're talking to Go Hae-ri, right?

6
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,429
Min Jae-sik is desperate
to catch you guys.

7
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,722
Where is Kim Woo-gi?

8
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,474
Did you ask for proof?

9
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,975
There is one.

10
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,352
A good one.

11
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,688
What is it?

12
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,233
A video file

13
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,360
of me and Michael making a deal.

14
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:54,447
If what Kim said is true,
it will turn this country upside down.

15
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,827
I hereby announce
that the new budget is approved.

16
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,370
Congratulations, sir.

17
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,999
Seal the deal with John &amp; Mark right away.

18
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,460
Our people are calling for it.

19
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,295
REPUBLIC OF KOREA AIRFORCE
PROCUREMENT AGREEMENT

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,965
The MND and John &amp; Mark
already signed a deal.

21
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,300
But the trial hasn't even started.

22
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,302
How rotten are you guys?

23
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,513
As for the agreed amount,

24
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,516
you can send it to this account.

25
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,560
Send the money we prepared.

26
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,020
What happened here?

27
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,273
We are on the ocean. He can't escape.

28
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,482
Hey, Kim.

29
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,402
Don't move!

30
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,574
You must be bored in that cargo ship.
So how about we play a game?

31
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,201
-Go Hae-ri is turning herself in.
-Where are you?

32
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,036
We're in New Delhi, India.

33
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,123
Get me a ticket
for the earliest flight tomorrow.

34
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,833
Min has sharp eyes.

35
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,543
Be careful.

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,503
Come on, Go Hae-ri.

37
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,214
Do you think you can fool me?

38
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,883
We found Kim Woo-gi.

39
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,930
What the hell are you saying?
What do you mean our information leaked?

40
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,974
We were only talking to each other.

41
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,392
Why can't you understand?

42
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,811
He knew that we were tailing him,
from the start.

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,770
If...

44
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,815
Something in there?

45
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,568
I found a monitoring system
inside your phone.

46
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,945
Where's Gi Tae-ung?

47
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,948
He's at Incheon Container Terminal No.1.

48
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,869
Chief.

49
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,913
Don't arrest him.

50
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,748
Take him out...

51
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,792
at all costs.

52
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,298
A hearing for the compensation claim

53
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,593
filed against Dynamic
by the bereaved from the B357 crash

54
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,511
will be held this afternoon.

55
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,056
As it's not clear whether Kim Woo-gi,

56
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,226
Cha Dal-geon, and Go Hae-ri
will attend as witnesses,

57
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,812
there's a keen interest
in whom the court will be in favor of.

58
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,898
COURT

59
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,070
POLICE

60
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,995
Can I see your ID?

61
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,671
Come on, we're the bereaved.

62
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,590
What's this checkup for?

63
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,633
Tell us why.

64
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,802
No one can get in without a proper ID.

65
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,388
-And take this off--
-What the hell?

66
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,182
Don't make a fuss. Just cooperate.

67
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,475
He's right.

68
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,644
Damn it.

69
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,730
Why isn't there any camera?

70
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,358
I guess no reporter has shown up.

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,072
The police are barricading outside
and keeping reporters out?

72
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,199
What kind of nation is this?

73
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,994
Is this what the Korean government does?

74
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,425
You seem to be in a good mood.

75
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,264
My insomnia seems to be gone.

76
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,726
I had such a good night's sleep
last night.

77
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,271
Congratulations on everything.

78
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,608
It's no use only talking at a desk

79
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,156
about justifications
and practical interests.

80
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,828
In the game of go, the first move
can be the last, and vice versa.

81
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,039
It's the same principle
in life and politics.

82
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,083
I should thank you for your input.

83
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,378
Then don't just say that.
Share some with me.

84
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,423
-Share what?
-The money, of course.

85
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,258
You have too much slush fund to spend.

86
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,261
"Slush fund"?

87
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,390
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,809
Come on,

89
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,812
it's not that big of a secret between us.

90
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,814
-From John &amp; Mark--
-Prime Minister Hong.

91
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,572
I've stepped over the line.

92
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,949
Please forgive me, brother.

93
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,995
Is that money only for my wellbeing?

94
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:18,086
We can't be penniless
to maintain our regime.

95
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,715
What would become
of the future of Korean politics

96
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,759
if I just sat back after my term?

97
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,386
It'd be hopeless.

98
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,056
That's why I brought it up.

99
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,643
We can't brag about it to others,

100
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,978
it's nothing to be ashamed of between us.

101
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,568
You're drawing a big picture
for better politics in Korea,

102
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,612
so smudging some paints
won't be a big deal.

103
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,407
I'm worried about your health

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,536
because you care about
these trivial details.

105
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,665
I'm hungry. Are they coming yet?

106
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,334
Oh, okay.

107
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,174
Right after the interview
will be the breakfast meeting.

108
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:09,178
It won't be more than an hour,
then you have no schedule here.

109
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,433
Why don't you put on the jacket?

110
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,311
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

111
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,022
I haven't been informed of any dress code.

112
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,067
The White House isn't like this.

113
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,285
Never talk about money to the President.

114
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,998
I've dealt with many Chiefs of States,
so stop worrying.

115
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,922
Mr. President is here.

116
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,427
THE BLUE HOUSE

117
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,263
Hello and welcome.

118
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,349
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm Jessica Lee.

119
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,185
Please sit.

120
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,151
I've heard a lot about you.

121
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,071
I knew you were competent
but didn't know you're beautiful.

122
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,744
Why, thank you.
You are charming, too, Mr. President.

123
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,704
Did you hear that?

124
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,082
She says I'm charming.

125
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,709
Well, of course.

126
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,504
You won the presidential election
because of that.

127
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,551
Anyway, thank you in advance
for your work with the F-X plan.

128
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,012
The pleasure is all mine.

129
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:38,184
Tie up the issue of the maintenance depot

130
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,685
and technology transfer.

131
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,145
Of course.

132
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,523
They are clearly stated in the contract.

133
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm sorry to interrupt,

134
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,744
but breakfast is ready.

135
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,580
Do we have to go to the reception hall?

136
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,541
Pardon?

137
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,293
I'd like it to be set up here.

138
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,587
Yes, right away, sir.

139
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,967
It's Korean cuisine.

140
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,510
Hope you like it.

141
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,765
If you strip off my American citizenship,
I'm all Korean.

142
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,603
"Strip off"?

143
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,514
Thank you!

144
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,002
Mr. Gi!

145
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,837
Good job.

146
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,173
That prick...

147
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,344
Well done.

148
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,936
We can get to court in time,
if we move right now.

149
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,271
Let's go.

150
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,030
Get in!

151
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,412
It's from the container yard.

152
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,044
What's this?

153
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:12,963
This way!

154
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,387
-This way!
-Okay.

155
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,399
-Hey, Go Hae-ri.
-Give it to me.

156
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,316
-Hey!
-Hey!

157
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,076
Assholes! I'm going to kill them all!

158
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,841
Already tired?
Did you start drinking again?

159
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,259
My fucking knees hurt!

160
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,677
Gosh!

161
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,762
-Let me carry it.
-No, no!

162
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,348
-You go ahead first.
-Jeez.

163
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,074
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm good!

164
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,798
Kill them already!

165
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,550
The suckers have guns, too!

166
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,802
And you're scared of them?
Just keep shooting!

167
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,855
Shit!

168
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,159
That car is ours, right?

169
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,579
Cover me while I get that back here.

170
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,499
Are you crazy? You'll be dead out there.

171
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,459
We'll be dead in here, too.

172
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,378
Calm down. Don't get worked up.

173
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,172
Do you have a better idea?

174
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,257
I'll do it. Cover me.

175
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,592
Sir!

176
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,761
How fast do you run on a 100-meter race?

177
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,597
-13 seconds.
-Me? 12.4.

178
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,766
If we race, I'll beat you big time.

179
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,726
-Not the time for a competition!
-Gosh!

180
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,980
Sons of bitches!

181
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,402
Holy shit! Do you carry a grenade?

182
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,862
Because I owe them!

183
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,156
It's time to pay back the shame I got
in Morocco.

184
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,534
-I'll cover you. Throw it in there.
-You got it.

185
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,835
Fuck!

186
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,089
-Son of a bitch!
-Fuck, fuck!

187
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,883
Get down!

188
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,015
Hey, where did that bullet come from?
Where? Where?

189
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,937
That was a sniper shot.

190
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,230
"A sniper"?

191
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,856
Who's the sniper?

192
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,291
-Are you sure you have a hand tremor?
-Just give me the coordinates.

193
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,502
Target, black beanie.

194
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,379
Distance, 388 meters.

195
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,048
Wind from left to right,
30 miles per hour.

196
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,474
Oh, jeez!

197
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,810
-What's wrong?
-Cramps!

198
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,813
-Massage my hand.
-Gosh. Earlier, you had cramps in the leg!

199
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,066
Where the hell did the bullet come from?

200
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,318
Can you see the sniper?

201
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,242
-What the fuck is going on?
-Why? You know who that is?

202
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:11,952
It's--

203
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,038
Holy shit!

204
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,332
Cover me.

205
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,489
The wind has changed,
right to left, 10 miles.

206
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,691
Hae-ri, go!

207
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,906
Sir!

208
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,241
Quickly!

209
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,662
Shit, get in!

210
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,500
Come on!

211
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,298
After them! Now!

212
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,138
Oh, no!

213
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:55,973
Chief, chief!

214
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,745
Jessica,

215
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,080
are you Miss or Mrs.?

216
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,044
If you know someone nice,
please set me up.

217
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,547
It's not that you couldn't...

218
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,593
-Any special reason you aren't married?
-It's true I couldn't.

219
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,389
Charming people like you
have made my standard too high.

220
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,106
I've heard the oil drilling project
in Kiria isn't going well.

221
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,409
It's an off-the-record project.

222
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,119
How do you know about it?

223
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,624
Oh, dear.
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

224
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:08,087
I thought it was okay to talk about it
since King Abdullah told me himself.

225
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,800
Prime Minister Hong,
is that project not going well?

226
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,678
Are you in charge, Mr. Prime Minster?

227
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,391
I was going to tell you.
Let me brief you later.

228
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,479
Do you know

229
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,565
King Abdullah well?

230
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,028
At first, it was only for business,
but now we're friends.

231
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:42,454
Prime Minister Hong could use your help.

232
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,209
Use Jessica in our favor.

233
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,463
I've already found a partner
in that region.

234
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,383
I'll contact you when I need your help.

235
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,053
Sure. I'm always at your service.

236
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,016
Would you like some alcohol?

237
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,394
I'd love to.

238
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,772
You're meeting the three party leaders
after this, sir.

239
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,067
You shouldn't have arranged this meeting
here at the Blue House.

240
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,237
There are many
cozy and good restaurants out there.

241
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,993
Please have me invite you
to a good restaurant next time.

242
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,412
That's not a bad idea.

243
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,968
Who's the partner
of the Prime Minister?

244
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,929
-I don't know.
-Please find out who.

245
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,435
You're trying to bite
more than you can chew.

246
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,901
Go ahead.

247
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,070
Kim Woo-gi is heading to the court now.

248
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,033
We've been pursuing them
from the Incheon Port.

249
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,118
They're right there.

250
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,954
Get behind them.

251
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,417
We're catching up with them.

252
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,754
Oh, no!

253
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,176
-Watch out!
-They're behind us!

254
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,427
Fuck!

255
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,387
Closer, closer.

256
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,060
No!

257
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,488
Shit!

258
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,658
Watch out!

259
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,829
Don't lose them! Go!

260
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,164
Keep shooting!

261
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,134
Open the fucking window!

262
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,054
-Hey!
-Look!

263
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,847
-Are you crazy?
-Come on!

264
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,309
-Are you crazy?
-Oh, no!

265
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,353
Keep following them.

266
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,074
-Shit!
-Damn it!

267
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,957
-Did I lose them?
-I think you did!

268
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,042
-Damn it.
-Good! High five!

269
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,420
-We didn't die!
-Just keep driving!

270
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,963
We didn't fucking die!

271
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,509
That fucking nutjob.

272
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,885
What happened?

273
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,096
We've lost them.

274
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,517
Cha Dal-geon is a stuntman alright.

275
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,519
He's driving like a maniac.

276
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,980
Call the police for backup.

277
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,653
Cha Dal-geon is here with Kim Woo-gi.

278
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,280
What?

279
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,741
He's shaken off our team
and now he is going to court.

280
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,537
Inform the President.

281
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,748
We must stop them no matter what!

282
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,091
It's me, Mr. Hong. Where are you now?

283
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,597
Anyway, thank you.

284
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,268
You've gone beyond your party's interests

285
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,730
and showed what real patriotism is.

286
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,941
I saw the hope for our politics

287
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,152
when the supplementary budget
was approved.

288
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,155
Of course we should be bipartisan
when working together.

289
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,073
That's right.

290
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,284
I need to talk to you right now.

291
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,207
The party leaders are here. Let's--

292
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,376
I'm sorry, but please give us a moment.

293
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,631
What? Kim Woo-gi?

294
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,051
What the hell have you been doing?

295
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,969
You can scold me later,

296
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,347
but right now we need to stop him.

297
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,057
The B357 crash...

298
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,602
Did you orchestrate it?

299
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,608
Was it you who abetted the crash?

300
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,155
-I've got nothing to do with it.
-Then who was behind it?

301
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,034
The culprit is
John &amp; Mark's vice president alone.

302
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,663
What I've been doing was
only to destroy the evidence.

303
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,915
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

304
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,586
We've already signed the contract.
What the hell are we supposed to do?

305
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,382
It's not too late.

306
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,884
The slush fund in the bank in Singapore.

307
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,970
Give it back to John &amp; Mark.

308
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,067
That money is...

309
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,906
...to continue the genealogy of politics
for a thousand years in Korea.

310
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,455
Tell me what I need to do.

311
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,793
You need to move the police right now.

312
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,638
Get the police commissioner on the line.

313
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,268
NO ENTRY
NO VEHICLES ALLOWED

314
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,444
The plate number, 65-jo-4990.
Dark blue SUV.

315
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,280
It's running away to Seoul from Incheon.

316
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,616
A total of five people.

317
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,493
All are suspects for the B357 crash...

318
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,413
...and they're armed with guns.

319
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,832
No need to capture them alive.

320
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,432
Keep me updated on what's going on.

321
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,227
Yes, sir.

322
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,487
Fucking retard.

323
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,379
-Here!
-Please look here!

324
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,507
-What happened?
-Please explain what happened!

325
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,553
Please look here!

326
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,100
THE FIRST HEARING ON B357 CASE
WILL BE HELD TODAY

327
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,393
O SANG-MI APPEARING AS A WITNESS

328
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,645
The court will open soon.

329
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,023
DRIVER'S VOICE
THROUGH BACKSEAT SPEAKERS

330
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,566
Any cars following us now?

331
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,027
I think we've lost them.

332
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,612
Pull over. I'll drive.

333
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,572
I'll keep driving.

334
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,867
What if your recklessness
causes an accident? It's all over, then!

335
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,162
Hae-ri Go, who do you
prefer for your driver?

336
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,540
What?

337
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,750
Well, obviously...

338
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:32,382
Shit. Min is controlling even the police.

339
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,512
The police?

340
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,098
Well, bring it on, then.

341
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,685
I'm going to take that prick
to the court no matter what.

342
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,194
Spotting the vehicle with the number 4990.

343
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,156
The terror suspects are entering
Jungdong Route 17.

344
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,324
Requesting backup.

345
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,620
Let's go to be their backup, then.

346
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,549
Give us a moment.

347
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,312
You promised I wouldn't be detained.

348
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,483
You can't possibly expect me
to testify in favor of you now.

349
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,903
-You'll be released after the trial.
-Can you give your word?

350
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,739
If you break your promise again, I will--

351
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,908
Kim Woo-gi might show up at the court.

352
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,206
Then the trial

353
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,750
is useless.

354
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,129
Does he have any evidence?

355
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,547
"Evidence"?

356
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,301
I don't think so.

357
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,595
Are you sure?

358
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,556
He told me nothing about it.

359
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,060
Then all they got is his words.

360
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,688
That means we can win, right?

361
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,315
Because we have evidence.

362
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,693
If he doesn't show up at all,

363
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,780
it'd be best.

364
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,810
DEFENDANT

365
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,319
I've heard you always drink coffee
before trials.

366
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,364
I've figured
it might be your secret for winning.

367
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,205
"Break the routine
of the opposing lawyers."

368
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,334
I learned it from you.

369
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,962
And I see it's working.

370
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,466
"If the opposing lawyers do
something out of their routine,

371
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,885
it means they are nervous."

372
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,474
I think your routine is
more broken than mine.

373
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,352
All, rise!

374
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,363
JUDGE

375
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,281
Be seated.

376
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,000
The case number 2012,
the first civil collegial court 4576.

377
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,045
The trial for the B357 crash
compensation claim

378
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,672
now begins.

379
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,717
Are witnesses from both parties

380
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,427
all present?

381
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,473
-Ms. O Sang-mi is, but Mr. Kim Woo-gi--
-He'll be here soon.

382
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,648
Do you mean Kim Woo-gi will be here?

383
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,650
Yes, not only him,

384
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,819
but also Cha Dal-geon and Go Hae-ri.

385
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,154
-What?
-Cha Dal-geon, too?

386
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,371
The defense may call its first witness.

387
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,706
I call Mr. Park Kwang-deok to the stand.

388
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,124
What?

389
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,837
-What's wrong with you?
-This is wrong!

390
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,088
Get it together!

391
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,132
Wake up! Kwang-deok, don't!

392
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,385
-You can't do this!
-You're mistaken!

393
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,303
-Unbelievable!
-I can't believe it!

394
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,582
WITNESS

395
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,011
Do you have evidence

396
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,930
your husband, Kim Woo-gi,
was abetted by Dynamic?

397
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,600
Yes.

398
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,852
What is it?

399
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,688
A secret bank account.

400
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,942
He used it to deal with Dynamic.

401
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:56,164
This is the bank transaction history
between Kim Woo-gi and Dynamic.

402
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,083
I knew it!

403
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,756
Wait.

404
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,426
John &amp; Mark fabricated the evidence!

405
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,970
You mean Dynamic! What's wrong with you?

406
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,681
Ui-jeong's dad, please stop being fooled!

407
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,850
It's you who's being fooled.

408
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,977
Have you been bribed by Dynamic?

409
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,103
What did you say?

410
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,939
How can you say such a thing?

411
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:21,940
Silence!

412
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:26,110
Cha was said to be bribed by Dynamic, too!
Why are you defending him so much?

413
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,071
Be quiet! You know nothing!

414
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,572
-What?
-What do you know?

415
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,287
That's enough!

416
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,331
Stop!

417
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,380
If you fail to heed my warning again,

418
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,924
I will issue a warrant
for contempt of court.

419
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,480
Go on.

420
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,278
There is five billion Won in this account.

421
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,076
Because only my husband
knows the password,

422
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,286
I can't access that money.

423
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,457
Your honor,

424
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,878
I'm submitting this transaction history
as evidence No. 12.

425
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,171
Objection!

426
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,134
The bank accounts Kim used are
all secret accounts in Switzerland,

427
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,011
it's impossible to identify the owner.

428
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,138
Are you saying the witness
is perjuring herself?

429
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,681
Stop right there.

430
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,226
The court will take it as evidence.

431
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,485
The court will be in recess and come back
with the ruling at two o'clock.

432
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,123
-What the...
-What's going on?

433
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,753
Two more cars after us.

434
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,434
Damn it.

435
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,354
To the intersection
from District seven's office.

436
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,398
Requesting backup from nearby police.

437
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,109
After the intersection,
it's heading to the clearing.

438
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,402
Hurry with the barricades.

439
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,365
The execution order.

440
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,786
Is it from the President?

441
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,665
When armed terrorists
are roaming around the city,

442
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,794
what would you do?

443
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,219
TTOBONG'S CHICKEN

444
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,149
Wow.

445
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,276
Gosh, it's really on.

446
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,487
He's really good.

447
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,324
How did you break through
the NIS's impenetrable security?

448
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,744
I want you to capture this clip
and spread it with this info on SNS.

449
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,579
Okay.

450
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,129
Wow, his fingers--

451
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,464
They're moving really fast!

452
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,882
What is he?

453
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,342
I'm Gye Jang-su.

454
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,262
Gae Jang-su?
Do you sell dogs in a chicken place?

455
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,763
-Yes.
-Really?

456
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,356
Listen.

457
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,904
Losing this trial means

458
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,031
we'll be losing all hope.

459
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,159
Then, stop being a pain in the ass.

460
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,451
He's right.

461
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,621
Kwang-deok, check this out.

462
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,248
There's a big fuss on the SNS.

463
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,793
LIVE CHAT

464
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,670
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THEY DRIVE SO FAST

465
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,257
Search "Kim Woo-gi" in real-time.
He's on the way here.

466
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,891
What?

467
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,644
Why are the police chasing them,
not escorting them?

468
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,396
Click that one. That one.

469
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,150
-I'll be right back.
-Where are you going?

470
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,528
If the police catch them,
they'll fabricate the evidence for sure.

471
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,240
-I need to go help them.
-Wait, where are they?

472
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,536
I can find them through real-time search
with my phone. See you!

473
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,537
I'll come with you!

474
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:52,043
-Guys, aren't you coming with us?
-Do you really believe this prank?

475
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,754
If it were true,
there'd be an article about it.

476
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,882
That's what we've been saying!

477
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,092
They're covering up the truth.

478
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,552
Jeez, like talking to a wall!

479
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,596
Damn it. Kwang-deok!

480
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,016
Whom should we believe?

481
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,440
This recess takes forever!

482
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,778
Before Kim gets here, get the judge to
deliver the ruling by any means necessary!

483
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,781
I can't control the judge,

484
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,116
but maybe the Chief Justice can.

485
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,787
I'll ask Senior Secretary Yun.
Finish it ASAP.

486
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,043
Don't get so worked up.

487
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,754
This one shot will finish it all.

488
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,674
Neatly.

489
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,009
That's the last resort.

490
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,637
We won't use it until necessary,

491
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,931
but when we do, make it count.

492
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,393
I won't tolerate any mistake this time.

493
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,852
"Mistake"?

494
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,397
My ego hurts.

495
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
Yes, have you found a good spot?

496
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,578
-What do you have?
-It doesn't seem good at all.

497
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,921
Where are you?

498
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,924
The case number 2012,

499
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,094
the first civil collegial court 4576.

500
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,556
The court will deliver the ruling
of the first trial

501
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,309
of the B357 compensation claim.

502
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,893
Your Honor.

503
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,314
Go ahead.

504
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,734
Kim Woo-gi is on his way now.

505
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,904
The witness testimony is vital--

506
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,033
Kim Woo-gi is a witness for the plaintiff.

507
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,201
If he were on his way, I would know.

508
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,995
Yes, he's got a point.

509
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,455
Is he coming, or what?

510
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,417
We've waited long enough.
Please deliver the ruling.

511
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,222
It's from the Chief Justice.

512
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,142
WRAP UP THE TRIAL ASAP!

513
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,373
-Mr. attorney for the defendant?
-Yes, your Honor.

514
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,833
Will 30 minutes do?

515
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,424
Yes, it will definitely do.

516
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,440
Now a chopper is on our tail.

517
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,234
What kind?

518
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,032
It's from a TV station.

519
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:16,122
Wow, finally we're on TV?
I'll show them a hell of a driving.

520
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,009
We've found them! Prep a live feed!

521
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,679
Ten minutes will do. You got it.

522
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,764
Great!

523
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,103
Please check the audio.
One, two. One, two.

524
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,774
Mr. O, it's Yun Han-gi.
Get the chopper out of there.

525
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,986
Don't pretend you know nothing!

526
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,989
Your news station has sent it!

527
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,377
What did you just say?

528
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,921
Broadcasting ethics?
Responsibility to report?

529
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,007
Listen, Mr. O.

530
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,135
We dug into you
when selecting the station CEO.

531
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,472
Your dirty deeds
from sexual harassment to bribery

532
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,931
were all covered up by me.

533
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,809
I'll say it one last time.

534
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,811
Turn the chopper around.

535
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,152
Are we there yet?

536
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,613
After the intersection turn right.

537
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,158
The police will be there, too.
Prepare yourselves.

538
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,750
What the hell is this?

539
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,669
VEHICLE CONTROL
NO ENTRY

540
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,464
Shit!

541
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,687
Shit!

542
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,825
TURN AROUND

543
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,166
What now?

544
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,834
Let's hang on.

545
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,174
They won't shoot us
when the TV chopper is up there.

546
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,095
You got a point.

547
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,440
What are all these?

548
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,527
That's them! The SUV over there!

549
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,912
What do you mean to stop broadcasting?

550
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,124
I'm not doing this to get a scoop.

551
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:09,503
There's armed police stopping Kim Woo-gi
from going to the court.

552
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,047
It's insane and it's not right.

553
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,258
If we don't report something like this,
then--

554
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,634
Hello?

555
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,720
Hello, sir! Sir...

556
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,930
Damn it!

557
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,765
Fuck!

558
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,977
Kwang-deok!

559
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,021
That helicopter is leaving.

560
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,607
What? I don't understand. Why?

561
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,201
Oh, no. The chopper is turning back.

562
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,162
What?

563
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:44,788
But why?

564
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,383
Someone is pressuring them.

565
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,678
Don't expect any help because we are...

566
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,015
...fighting against the Korean government.

567
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,027
I'm warning you!

568
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:19,323
Unless you drop your weapons
and come out--

569
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,535
Hey, Cha Dal-geon!

570
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,084
You're a fucking good driver.

571
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,222
Wow, nice spot.

572
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,099
Plain light, too.

573
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,603
However,

574
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,399
the weather is too good to stink of blood.

575
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:01,949
Let's see.

576
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:06,495
The traffic is heavy in this area,
so we can't give you much time.

577
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,915
I'll give you 10 seconds
to drop your weapons and come out.

578
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,171
Or else, you will all be very dead.

579
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,974
When they're out,

580
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,767
shoot them all.

581
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,394
What?

582
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,189
Don't be so surprised.
Didn't you get the order to fire?

583
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,193
I did, but isn't it only for an emergency?

584
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,778
Jeez.

585
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:45,075
What if your indecisive response
puts the officers in danger?

586
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,828
Will you take responsibility?

587
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,377
Okay, the countdown begins.

588
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,379
Ten,

589
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,049
nine,

590
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,761
eight...

591
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,806
-Seven...
-Sir...

592
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,559
Six,

593
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,395
five...

594
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,190
Do something!

595
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,107
Four,

596
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,193
three...

597
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,738
-Hey!
-Don't!

598
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,448
-Come on!
-Don't shoot!

599
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,741
Don't shoot!

600
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,618
Don't shoot, please!

601
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,079
My gosh...

602
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:52,976
Fuck!

603
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:02,611
Cha Dal-geon, don't be bullheaded.
Come out!

604
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,529
Now.

605
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:06,865
Fuck!

606
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,204
Give them the order.

607
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,921
Fire now.

608
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,176
Fire!

609
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,945
Get down!

610
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,739
Oh, shit!

611
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,062
-Are they really firing?
-They're crazy!

612
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,565
What?

613
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,282
Oh, my God!

614
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,495
Don't stop! Don't fucking stop!

615
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,377
Dal-geon, run!

616
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,509
Go now!

617
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:32,969
Get in!

618
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,394
Let's go!

619
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:54,825
Don't let them into the court!
Stop them! Go fucking after them!

620
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,118
Now!

621
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,669
What's wrong with the car?

622
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:13,135
-The court is right there. Run!
-Get out.

623
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,515
Get down!

624
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,789
Dal-geon, go!

625
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,791
Go now!

626
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,293
Hurry up!

627
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,586
Run!

628
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,087
Let's go!

629
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,646
Oh, God.

630
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,608
What if they end up being captured?

631
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,509
Are they really coming here now?

632
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,886
I don't know who to believe anymore.

633
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,516
Look over there!

634
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,936
Oh, my God. They are really here!

635
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,245
Good job, guys.

636
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,872
I dare you to come one step closer.

637
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,418
-What the hell?
-What is he doing with that gun?

638
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,172
God damn it.

639
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,509
Try to come closer, motherfuckers!

640
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,930
You evil bastards!

641
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,518
Get off me!

642
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,230
Get the fuck off me!

643
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,277
We'll open the way. You take Kim inside.

644
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,492
I'll leave him to you.

645
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,842
-Go!
-Let go, you bastard!

646
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,303
Let's go!

647
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,876
We've got to go!

648
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,685
SEOUL FAMILY COURT,
SEOUL DISTRICT COURT, SEOUL HIGH COURT

649
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,289
Where did that bullet come from?

650
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:18,797
A sniper!

651
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,396
Are you okay, Hae-ri?

652
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,024
Yes, I'm okay. We got to go now.

653
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,281
Let me go, you bastards!

654
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,535
-Let me go!
-Stop them!

655
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,688
COURT

656
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,233
What the hell are you doing?

657
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,526
I can't aim

658
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,737
because of the bereaved families.

659
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,989
It's not the time to think about that!

660
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,450
Shoot! Do it now!

661
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,298
For fuck's sake!

662
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,719
-Let's leave.
-Really?

663
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:51,139
-Aren't you on a hunt?
-Get the gun, too.

664
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,141
What about the rest of the money?

665
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,478
I won't let you die of poverty.
Don't worry.

666
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,089
What the fuck did you do?
Why didn't you kill Kim Woo-gi?

667
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,507
We got a sniper here.

668
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,258
He's a pro.

669
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,221
What? Who sent the sniper?

670
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,599
Who do you think?
It's Edward, that fucking son of a bitch!

671
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,061
Get out of there for now.

672
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,980
Your Honor, 30 minutes have passed.

673
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,028
Oh, the watch is dead.

674
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,197
To drag it any longer--

675
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,414
Kim Woo-gi...

676
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,042
...is present.

677
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,367
