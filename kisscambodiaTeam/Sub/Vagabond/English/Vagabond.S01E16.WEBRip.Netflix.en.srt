1
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,507
It's time, sir.

2
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:19,013
Even for a moment,
neither have I pursued my own interest,

3
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,976
nor lived a life for my own agenda.

4
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,979
After being elected as the President,

5
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,023
in order to make Korea better,

6
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,567
I have always

7
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,570
put my best efforts.

8
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,949
Now Korea is standing
at a major crossroad,

9
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,577
and she needs a devoted President.

10
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,581
It'd be a tragedy for the whole nation

11
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,542
if the President wasted time

12
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,629
to defend himself.

13
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,216
Therefore, I, Jeong Gook-pyo will

14
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,262
from now on,

15
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,849
step down

16
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,019
from office.

17
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,871
119
PARAMEDIC

18
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,125
AMBULANCE

19
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,435
I haven't been able to reach him for
days.

20
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,647
Find out where his phone
has been turned off last.

21
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,565
Thank you, Hwa-suk.

22
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,658
Gosh, Cha Dal-geon!

23
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,793
Who are you?

24
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,461
We're the police.

25
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,841
What are you doing in an empty house?

26
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,219
How do you know Mr. Cha?

27
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,723
I'm his friend.

28
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,269
We found his fingerprints in the ward
where Kim Woo-gi was abducted.

29
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,021
Excuse me?

30
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,528
-Thank you.
-Excuse me!

31
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,409
When did you last meet him?

32
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,286
So what you're saying is

33
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,788
he has abducted Kim?

34
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,083
That's outrageous!

35
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,172
Yes?

36
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,716
We've found Kim Woo-gi.

37
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,759
Where is he?

38
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,264
He's dead?

39
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,644
KIM WOO-GI

40
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,942
Are you sure it's him?

41
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,278
We checked his DNA
from his hip joint.

42
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,279
It's him.

43
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,996
What about this body?

44
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,587
Didn't you check his DNA as well?

45
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,880
He's not on our system.

46
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,923
But his blood type

47
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,677
is O.

48
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,685
Mine is O, too. Give him my blood.

49
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,235
The police are looking for Dal-geon
as Kim's abductor.

50
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,869
I hope

51
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,288
you don't believe their accusation.

52
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,457
The last place he used his cell was

53
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,919
the fire site.

54
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,170
Sir!

55
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,714
What's wrong with you?

56
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:25,760
You know his call history
can be easily fabricated!

57
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,678
Excuse me.

58
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,225
These are from the fire site.

59
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,187
NFS
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

60
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,663
-What?
-It's our lucky charm.

61
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,998
If you keep it, the luck will come to you.

62
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,628
I know Dal-geon isn't the abductor.

63
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,135
But we think that's Dal-geon's body.

64
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,497
The victims from the chemical plant fire
which happened on the 17th in Incheon

65
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,499
have been identified.

66
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,127
The police have confirmed
the bodies found at the site

67
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,047
are the B357 terrorist, Kim Woo-gi,

68
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,967
and one of the bereaved, Cha Dal-geon.

69
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,679
It appears Cha abducted and killed Kim,

70
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,474
and set fire at the warehouse
to kill himself, too.

71
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,435
The police will close the case
this week.

72
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,121
CHA DAL-GEON

73
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,188
CHARNEL HOUSE

74
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,863
It's such a shame.

75
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,449
Consider it a blessing.

76
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,119
You're now off to meet your nephew.

77
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,843
That's the one, right? 8685.

78
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,391
You can be useful sometimes.

79
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,602
I can continue to be your partner, right?

80
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,396
I never care for a partner,

81
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,815
but maybe a minion.

82
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,163
I can't believe
Kim Woo-gi's abductor is Edward.

83
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,461
What the fuck is going on?

84
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,427
CHA DAL-GEON

85
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,284
Get in the car now.

86
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,618
What's wrong?

87
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,454
Cha Dal-geon is there.

88
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,873
Cha Dal-geon?
What the hell is he doing there?

89
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,223
Are you fucking crazy?

90
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,684
Do you have a death wish? Fuck!

91
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,111
Save Kim Woo-gi!

92
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,243
Wake up, Cha.

93
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,078
Come on now!

94
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,165
Carry him.

95
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,298
Hurry up, and bring him out!

96
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,514
-Hurry!
-Fuck!

97
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,795
As the acting President,

98
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:02,883
I'll get to the bottom of the former
President's corruption scandals,

99
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:07,221
and tighten the discipline
of all government officials.

100
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:14,144
Basically, principles and earnest efforts
will be respected and appreciated

101
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:18,190
so that a new and healthy Korea
will be built.

102
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,985
I hope the citizens' pain
by this whole mess

103
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,945
will be mended quickly.

104
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,323
I promise to pour my soul and heart

105
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:32,037
to use this chance to bring
joy and pride to everyone.

106
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,581
My fellow citizens,

107
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,041
let's do it together.

108
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,383
Your inaugural speech was superb.

109
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,467
Yeah?

110
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,303
Got the approving rate?

111
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,929
It's 42%.

112
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,389
What? That's it?

113
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,684
That's over 10% higher
than the former President.

114
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,938
That's a very good start
considering you've done nothing yet.

115
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,525
Sir...

116
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,446
Samael is asking for a meeting.

117
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,936
He's expecting you.

118
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,538
He is Samael.

119
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,347
I believe I should start off again
on the right foot.

120
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,391
You think my order is a joke?

121
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,774
I told you to close the F-X deal
with Dynamic ASAP.

122
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,238
Open it.

123
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,706
LIST OF GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES

124
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,249
Heads of government ministries,

125
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,960
financial institutions,
and public enterprises

126
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,130
must be changed to the ones on that list.

127
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,841
Only the president can do that.

128
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,472
Oh.

129
00:16:55,556 --> 00:17:00,477
I wasn't told you'd be involved
in minute matters like this.

130
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,689
Why do you think
we put you in that position?

131
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,276
Obviously,
it's because I'm capable enough--

132
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,527
Are you?

133
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,866
Do you know
why conflicts between nations occur?

134
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,663
It's not for money, but for power.

135
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,582
The one who holds the debt

136
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:25,044
incurred during the conflicts
will be entitled to the world.

137
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,963
In other words,
whether it's a nation or an individual,

138
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,340
whoever makes their customer
owe them a debt

139
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,676
becomes the master.

140
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,388
You think you can accomplish that
all by yourself?

141
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,352
Don't be overconfident
and quick to judge.

142
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,688
We can replace you

143
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,901
with anyone for the next president.

144
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,832
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

145
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,338
There's a flash drive in there.

146
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,885
Read and learn

147
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,555
the trade negotiations and policies
toward other nations.

148
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,517
But the thing is,

149
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,312
I'm not quite popular among the citizens,

150
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,024
so it's not certain
if I'll be the next president.

151
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,404
Get the oil drilling project
in the Kingdom of Kiria,

152
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,283
and you'll quench
the nation's economic thirst,

153
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,286
which will naturally increase
your approval rate.

154
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,124
Okay, thank you for the tip.

155
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,542
You may leave.

156
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,838
And one more thing.

157
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,134
Wrap up all the investigations

158
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,302
about the crash.

159
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,640
You got it.

160
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,525
Can we

161
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,319
trust that guy?

162
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,503
Dal-geon got murdered.

163
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,593
He risked his life
to take Kim to court.

164
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,761
Why would he kill the suspect and himself

165
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,805
right before the appellate trial?

166
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,769
O Sang-mi, Kim Woo-gi,
and Dal-geon are all

167
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,854
victims of Samael--

168
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,897
The Task Force team

169
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,150
is now dismissed.

170
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,905
Every enforcement agency

171
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,617
was ordered to wrap up
all investigations on the B357.

172
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,498
Upon becoming the acting President,

173
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,793
Hong has shown his true colors.

174
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,515
ACTING PRESIDENT HONG SUN-JO

175
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,100
WE WILL MAKE A HEALTHY KOREA

176
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,979
EDWARD PARK, MICKY, JEROME
JO BU-YEONG, BLACK SUN

177
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,739
JEONG GOOK-PYO
INTERVENTION? ACCOMPLICE? HONG SUN-JO

178
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,242
BLACK SUN

179
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:52,251
BLACK SUN

180
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,217
Fucking doodler.

181
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,136
How much longer will you live off us?

182
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,765
He doesn't live off you!

183
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,225
You have no say in this.

184
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,227
Are you running a charity here?

185
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,021
He's accused of being a murderer,

186
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,274
so let him play opossum here.

187
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,025
Don't be mean.

188
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,151
Show him some mercy.

189
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,195
You showed
not even an ounce of mercy to me,

190
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,698
but you're fucking generous
to this sucker.

191
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,907
Whatever.

192
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,161
Are you not going to contact
Go Hae-ri at all?

193
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,707
No, and you aren't, either.

194
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,583
Why not?

195
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,502
You two seemed very close.

196
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,087
Had a fight?

197
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,092
Drop the gun.

198
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,304
Or else, all the families
and Go Hae-ri will die

199
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,597
because of you.

200
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,558
You're killing them all.

201
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,645
From now on,

202
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,231
she has nothing to do with me.

203
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,277
I'm leaving Korea soon.

204
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,406
You should find a way to live before that.

205
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,867
You said you knew Black Sun.

206
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,204
Jessica asked me to research them.

207
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,622
How can I get in?

208
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,668
Why? To kill Jerome?

209
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,629
MICKY

210
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,298
Micky is from their unit.

211
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,507
EDWARD PARK
DYNAMIC CEO

212
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,468
Edward must have authority over them.

213
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,970
Not anybody can get in,

214
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,014
and the tests are excruciatingly hard.

215
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,600
What if you help me?

216
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,772
This is why you shouldn't help
those in desperate need.

217
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,107
Look,

218
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,526
my hand is not for public use.

219
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm not giving it for free.

220
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,282
How much is it to hire you?

221
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,160
Hey, you fucking beggar.

222
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,871
Are you listening to yourself?
You're living off us!

223
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,956
I'm very expensive.

224
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,959
Ten times more expensive
than your life.

225
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,634
The DA's special division investigating
the scandals of the F-X plan

226
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,303
will request an arrest warrant

227
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,181
for the former President Jeong
by this week,

228
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,975
who has been confining himself
at his residence in Hongeun--

229
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,781
Yes?

230
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,324
This is Cha Dal-geon.

231
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,912
Who did you say you are?

232
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,997
It's Cha Dal-geon.

233
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,377
Is this a new fraud

234
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,172
impersonating the deceased
by mimicking his voice?

235
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,507
I'm right outside.

236
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,425
Please open the door.

237
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,573
Aren't you dead?

238
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,951
No time to explain.

239
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,329
I hope you didn't forget
your promise to help me.

240
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,166
Go on.

241
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,959
I need money.

242
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,920
What for?

243
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,342
I'm going into the monster's den
to get the monster.

244
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,601
Go to the Myeong-dong curb market,

245
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,187
and look for Jjanggu's mom.

246
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,189
She'll give you as much as you need.

247
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,069
It's strange, though.

248
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,991
I don't think you'll be struck dead
even by lightening.

249
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,369
That's why I'm helping you.

250
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,167
Your life is collateral,
and I'm confident I won't suffer a loss.

251
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,046
Before getting rid of those jerks,

252
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,882
I can't die.

253
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,324
Can you give me some space?

254
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,665
It's me.

255
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,875
Why haven't you visited me?

256
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,461
I'm going back to America.

257
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,879
What?

258
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,008
I have a new client,

259
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,388
and he's offered me loads of money.

260
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,766
Okay, fine.

261
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,310
Just do me a favor.

262
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,147
Meet Deputy Attorney General Brian,

263
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,525
and tell him to summon me.

264
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,235
Okay.

265
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,820
That's all I will do for you.

266
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,407
By the way,

267
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,826
do you know who Samael is?

268
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,577
Who is it?

269
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,579
Edward Park.

270
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,084
Are you sure?

271
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,172
Watch your back.

272
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,175
The devil is dangerously near you.

273
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,065
What's wrong?

274
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,150
What? No, nothing.

275
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,536
-Give me that.
-Okay

276
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,456
She's being released today.

277
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,639
You have information about Samael?

278
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,224
Come and sit first.

279
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,855
It's from Jessica.

280
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,570
I'm being watched by Samael.

281
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,614
He could kill me any day.

282
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,618
If you want to know who he is,
I need your protection

283
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,745
before being summoned to America.

284
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,458
Let me go to prison.

285
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,002
Are you out of your mind?

286
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,673
If Jessica dies,
we'll never know who Samael is.

287
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,759
There's nothing we can do officially.

288
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,469
Then let's do it unofficially.

289
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,096
What if you get caught?

290
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,390
Then we'll be cuffed up
for insubordination.

291
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,766
I need to catch Samael,

292
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,935
that son of a bitch.

293
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,854
Please let me do this.

294
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,356
Jessica's life is under threat.

295
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,442
So will be yours.

296
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,736
I don't care.

297
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,238
I'll lay out a plan.

298
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,699
Sir,

299
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,576
you'll let her do it?

300
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,286
She completed worse missions.

301
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,913
I'm counting on you.

302
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,915
Thank you.

303
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,377
Make up a story first, then cuff Hae-ri.

304
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,628
Yes, sir.

305
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,047
I can't believe this.

306
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,556
Next.

307
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,061
Come here.

308
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,356
Turn around.

309
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,443
Look to the front.

310
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,694
CRIME: HIDING CRIMINAL PROCEEDS
NAME: GO HAE-RI

311
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,197
There was a Korean consul

312
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,617
who was arrested for bribery
from a Moroccan drug cartel.

313
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,119
Apparently, she was involved
in the money laundering.

314
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,289
She must be working undercover.

315
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,875
Wasn't her team dismissed?

316
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,212
I think she's working alone.

317
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,840
That means Jessica knows something.

318
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,675
Why don't you get rid of her?

319
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,095
Let's keep an eye on her.

320
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,015
Why don't you kill her right away?

321
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,227
I want to know how much she knows.

322
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,604
We can get rid of her afterward.

323
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,899
This is not how you operate, boss.

324
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,776
She'll cause trouble for sure--

325
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,739
Forgive me.

326
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,384
Don't forget Samael has an eye on you.

327
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,262
Among guards or inmates,

328
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,847
there will be some of his men.

329
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,889
Go Hae-ri will recognize you.

330
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,850
Be careful.

331
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,993
It's safe in here.

332
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:53,703
Who is Samael?

333
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,539
I can't tell you right now.

334
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,708
What would I be without that information?

335
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,793
We'll be roommates soon

336
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,004
till you're recalled to America--

337
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,216
It's you who killed Dal-geon!

338
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,761
Who fed you that fucking bullshit?

339
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,221
Say it! Who's behind you?

340
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,390
-Bitch!
-What are you doing? Break it off!

341
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,642
Get the fuck off me!

342
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,482
No time to lose.

343
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,317
Who is Samael?

344
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,071
Edward.

345
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,366
Edward Park?

346
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,825
Do you remember Jerome?

347
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,953
That asshole is a guard here.

348
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,455
Dal-geon

349
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,042
was killed by Edward.

350
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,215
You're a fucking crazy bitch!

351
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,176
-I'll kill you!
-Get the fuck off me!

352
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,679
I said to get off me, you bitch!

353
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,053
Edward.

354
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,599
You fucking devil.

355
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,836
You have a visitor. Come out.

356
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,921
TO ESTABLISH LAW AND ORDER

357
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,596
I was surprised to hear the news.

358
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,225
Do you have a lawyer?

359
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,063
I'll get you a good one if you don't.

360
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,649
Or I can be your--

361
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,860
I've come here voluntarily.

362
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,905
I don't understand.

363
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,783
Cha Dal-geon

364
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,327
was killed by Jessica.

365
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,038
Do you have proof?

366
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,959
Samael, Black Sun,
the black operator's tattoo.

367
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,504
All the information we got from O Sang-mi

368
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,172
is fake.

369
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,133
Jessica deceived O.

370
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,053
Why would she do that?

371
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,888
She's trying to buy herself time

372
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,640
and confuse the investigation,

373
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,353
so that she can be recalled to America
in the meantime.

374
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,732
And Dal-geon found it out,

375
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,070
so she killed him.

376
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,201
You can't prove her crime by being here.

377
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,037
If there's no lawful way,

378
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,166
I'll deal with her myself.

379
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,420
For killing Dal-geon,

380
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,174
I'll pay her back.

381
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,150
Send me to another place!

382
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,361
I can't stand that fucking bitch.

383
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,614
Go Hae-ri attacked Jessica again.

384
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,783
She doesn't seem to put on a show.

385
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,119
Because she's showing
what she wants to show.

386
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,746
That's why

387
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,040
it's called a show.

388
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,001
What are you looking at?

389
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,711
Guards, do something!

390
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,504
Be quiet.

391
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,924
Go just picked up a scalpel.

392
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,766
-Oh!
-Hey, what are you doing!

393
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,060
Let me go!

394
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,563
Let me go!

395
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,816
-That crazy bitch--
-I'll kill you!

396
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,569
Get off me!

397
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,779
I'll kill you!

398
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:41,991
Get off me!

399
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,327
Let go!

400
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,870
I'll kill you!

401
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,142
Jessica is asking for a phone call.

402
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,438
-Allow it.
-Okay.

403
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,469
Yes?

404
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,638
This is Jessica.

405
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,017
I thought you were in prison.

406
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,520
I want to meet you.

407
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,065
Come and visit me.

408
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,127
The life here has taken a toll on you.

409
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,722
This is my email and password.

410
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,893
Rebate, tax evasion,
and illegal arms trade.

411
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,939
All the hideous crimes
John &amp; Mark committed are in there.

412
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,274
If I expose these,

413
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,277
the NEC will sanction your company,

414
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,862
and its stocks will plummet

415
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,156
to the point of bankruptcy.

416
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,866
Then you want me to take it over?

417
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,951
For old times' sake,

418
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,871
I'm giving you the last gift.

419
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,960
I don't understand why you suddenly have
a change of heart.

420
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,672
Those assholes stopped me

421
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,800
from being recalled to America.

422
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,887
What I did for the company
meant nothing to them.

423
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,056
They left me

424
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,600
to die here.

425
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,356
I appreciate your gift.

426
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,908
Why aren't you asking me for help?

427
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,536
I can easily make it happen

428
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,372
for you to be recalled.

429
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,921
Is it because of your ego? Or--

430
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,134
Even if it costs my life,

431
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,888
I'll never ask you for help.

432
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,915
Yes, I'm all ears.

433
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,584
Have Jessica summoned to the States.

434
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:54,887
DONGANG PRISON

435
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,414
Get in!

436
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,942
As soon as I got to America,
I bailed myself out.

437
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,861
It's not a big crime
for a lobbyist to lobby.

438
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,825
So tell me.
Have you thought about my proposal?

439
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,245
As a low-level NIS employee,

440
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,955
you can't avenge Cha's death.

441
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,250
Come to America with me,

442
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,043
and get trained for six months.

443
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,504
I can make you a top lobbyist.

444
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,881
After that?

445
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,758
We'll go to the Kingdom of Kiria.

446
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,388
Hong Sun-jo is working with Edward
on an oil drilling project there.

447
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,390
I will take it away from them.

448
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,768
We can't have Hong as the president,

449
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,687
and I can make some money out of it.

450
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,564
Make up your mind now.

451
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,691
If it's yes, we'll go to the airport.

452
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,364
Let's go to the airport.

453
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,366
That's my girl!

454
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,870
A lobbyist should know her timing.

455
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,206
It's Kiria's Minister of National Defense.

456
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,671
Geon, I've just hacked into their radio,

457
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,717
and the babysitter who will get
the biochemical weapon is Jerome.

458
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,855
If that jerk recognizes you, you're dead.

459
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:00,484
If you're done there,
make an excuse and get the hell out.

460
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,033
Geon.

461
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,452
Are you there?

462
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,873
I hope you aren't thinking
of doing something stupid!

463
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,627
I don't care
if something happens to you fucker,

464
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,547
but I won't allow you
to compromise our pay--

465
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,423
Geon, listen.

466
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,676
You've just made it into the Black Sun.

467
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,845
It'll be all for nothing if you screw up
before revealing--

468
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,847
Geon!

469
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,851
Fuck!

470
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,508
One of the bereaved

471
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,802
from the B357.

472
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,639
Cha Dal-geon.

473
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,833
Scared, huh?

474
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,543
Painful, too?

475
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,467
Your fear.

476
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,678
Your pain.

477
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,015
They're nothing compared
to what my nephew suffered in the crash.

478
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,439
Just fucking kill me!

479
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,108
Shoot me, motherfucker!

480
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,488
The antidote.

481
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:38,577
This shot can save you
if you get it within two minutes.

482
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,704
You'd better answer fast.

483
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,833
What is your organization?

484
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,822
What the hell is Axis?

485
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,047
Why does Edward need
the biochemical weapon?

486
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,511
Please give me... the vaccine.

487
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,764
One minute left.
Where do you plan to attack?

488
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,051
When you're in hell,

489
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,847
remember my nephew's name.

490
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,515
It's Hoon.

491
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,560
Cha Hoon.

492
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,809
MAYOR GWON HA-SEONG LEADING THE RACE
FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENCY

493
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,857
My approval rate is way below
than that of Gwon Ha-seong.

494
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,442
In this Presidential election,

495
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:19,237
the Kiria oil drilling project
might be the last variable.

496
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,032
You know that, right?

497
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:27,037
Their royal family contacted
a new lobbyist.

498
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,873
I can't remember the name,

499
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,833
but it's a female lobbyist.

500
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,255
Anyway, they are quite interested in
what she's offering.

501
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,593
I'll deal with it my way,
so mind your own business.

502
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,307
Please don't leave any loose ends.

503
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,142
I'm counting on you.

504
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,290
Okay, let me see you off here.

505
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,793
Get ready for the election
while I'm in Kiria.

506
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,094
That arrogant attitude.

507
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,179
I can't take it anymore.

508
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,556
Wait just until you become the President.

509
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,933
After that,

510
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,185
the tables will turn.

511
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,521
Damn, let's go.

512
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,114
It's an honor to serve you.

513
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,157
You've got many things to do in Kiria.

514
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,331
I'm at your service.
I'll do anything for you.

515
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,667
Oh, okay.

516
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,294
This way, please.

517
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,526
I heard she's a lobbyist,
but she's so stuck-up.

518
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,862
Still, she's here
to seduce Jaafar with her body.

519
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,407
I wonder whether
she'll see heaven or hell tonight.

520
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,576
We'll know tomorrow morning.

521
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,036
I swear I'm not lying.

522
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,456
Want me to tell you
if it's heaven or hell?

523
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,962
But I'm not sure
if you'll still be alive.

524
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,882
Forgive us.
We've made a big mistake.

525
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,846
Even if I forgave you,
I don't think Jaafar would.

526
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:16,683
Please don't say anything to him, ma'am.

527
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:21,896
If you want to stay alive,
focus on driving, and no more talking.

528
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,770
Move, move!

529
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,356
