1
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,577
Ms. O Sang-mi!

2
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,792
Who are you?

3
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,400
A safe house is for people
who are not safe.

4
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,408
The more beautiful the scenery is,
the more troubled you'd feel.

5
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,204
ORDINARY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE

6
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,831
I'm afraid you haven't been told,

7
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,917
but you can't use your phone here.

8
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,255
Okay.

9
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,386
The NIS agents will be here
for your protection.

10
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,101
Sir, when are you going
to interrogate O Sang-mi?

11
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,816
You'd better stop right here.

12
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,986
-Excuse me?
-Leave it to us.

13
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,447
You've done enough.

14
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,667
Damn, he has a weird way of
getting on my nerves.

15
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,421
Are you here for a tour?

16
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,674
If I catch you drinking at night shifts,
I'll kill you.

17
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,426
-Yes, sir.
-Stay focused.

18
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,806
Thank you for your hard work.
I feel like I'm bombarded, too.

19
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,516
Too much is happening all at once.

20
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,935
It's on you.

21
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,811
You're right.

22
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,650
By the way, what's happened
to my boss at the Blue House?

23
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,946
I mean, nobody was fired,
and the office is in total chaos.

24
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,694
-What are you doing here?
-Why else?

25
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,946
To protect your highness.

26
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,033
Wonder why I wasn't fired?

27
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,288
I told you I can't be fired
because I'm a special agent.

28
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,497
I'm that important.

29
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,667
What about O Sang-mi?

30
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,629
She's probably singing like a bird now.
Our very best is onto her.

31
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,508
Anyway, bravo.

32
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,845
Breaking into the Blue House
to meet the President?

33
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,182
Cha Dal-goen, thumb ups to you.

34
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,270
You know, the security guys came at me.

35
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,940
I managed ok with 15 of them,

36
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,984
but when it came to 30 guys,

37
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,153
all of them martial artists,

38
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,487
it wasn't easy even for me.

39
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,489
Wow, 30 of them?

40
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,199
That's right.

41
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,286
I didn't want to scare you,
but there were more.

42
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,580
-Really?
-Hell yeah.

43
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,956
Where are you, Go Hae-ri?

44
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,374
I'm coming!

45
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,043
Hey.

46
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,629
God of war.

47
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,049
Nice!

48
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,759
Hey, Hae-ri go, stop it.

49
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,677
Amazing!

50
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,938
She's been still like that for an hour.

51
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,027
She's being cautious,

52
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,945
meaning she's hiding a lot.

53
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,490
Hello.

54
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,909
-Hello, sir.
-Don't get up.

55
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,827
How's she doing?

56
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,580
Considering she's probably
never been interrogated,

57
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,790
she's surprisingly calm.

58
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,291
I didn't ask you, Gang.

59
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,338
She hasn't even moved her lips.

60
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,620
Have some.
You'll need some energy.

61
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,999
Why exactly did you bring me here?

62
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,001
You're here as a witness,

63
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,170
so relax.

64
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,756
The plane exploded and crashed.

65
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:09,762
Do you think
anyone could possibly survive from it?

66
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,889
You'll get two billion won in compensation

67
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,392
and five billion in life insurance payout.

68
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,478
Not to mention the money
for crashing the plane.

69
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,107
Even I couldn't have died,
leaving all that.

70
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,612
Okay, let's say he's alive.

71
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,949
It's nothing to do with me.

72
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,209
Your husband was on the phone
with the terrorist before takeoff.

73
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,961
You got it wrong.

74
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,630
He was on the phone with me.

75
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,134
Wanna know about what?

76
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,974
It was a very intimate conversation
between us two.

77
00:07:55,057 --> 00:08:00,563
Your number was not in his phone log.

78
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,106
How would you explain that?

79
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,160
Answer the question.

80
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,454
If you talked to your husband,

81
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,498
you surely can speak Spanish.

82
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,005
Of course, there's no record.

83
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:32,887
Because we used a burner phone
to avoid loan sharks.

84
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,185
What? Didn't you check her background
before the interrogation?

85
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,813
-Did you not know she could speak Spanish?
-I'm sorry, sir.

86
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,026
I won't even bother with you,
but what happened to Gi?

87
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,277
He's supposed to be good!

88
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,408
Anyway, you said you'd do it,
so find out everything.

89
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,660
Do whatever it takes!

90
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,252
I clearly told him
she could speak Spanish.

91
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,546
What's up with him?

92
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,632
-It's his strategy.
-"Strategy"?

93
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,884
But, sir...

94
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,220
Are we keeping this
from even the Director?

95
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,139
There's a mole in the NIS.

96
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,183
We can't be too careful.

97
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,351
Really?

98
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,830
Have some.
Seems like you need it more than I do.

99
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,879
Kim Woo-gi is in Morocco, right?

100
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,261
He must be very anxious by now.

101
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,181
Not knowing what you might spill out.

102
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,310
What are you talking--

103
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,895
With more than 10 billion won
from John &amp; Mark.

104
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,190
I get it.

105
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,942
To take the money,

106
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,194
you need to protect him.

107
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,450
My husband is dead.

108
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,203
He's dead.

109
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,710
Let her go.

110
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,088
But, sir?

111
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,049
Do you believe her?

112
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,429
The time is not up yet.
I'll take full responsibility--

113
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,640
Director's orders.
Don't make a scene.

114
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,705
How does that matter?

115
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,792
It's not easy there, it's dangerous.

116
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,421
So it's dangerous for me,
but not for the other guy?

117
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,843
Who is it?

118
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,389
Who's the asshole that snatched my client?

119
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,478
They are deadly and very brutal.

120
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,698
-Done!
-This is pissing me off.

121
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,950
Thank you, sir.

122
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,956
How is this 1,200,000 won?

123
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,541
UNCLE

124
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,877
Yes, talk to me.

125
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,798
I've already started working on it.

126
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,895
Cha Dal-geon seems to be sleeping.

127
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,440
Let him be. He'll be up when hungry.

128
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,316
I mixed jajangmyeon for you. Dig in.

129
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,860
I had a late lunch, so...

130
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,944
-Ours, then.
-Good.

131
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,737
Who said I wouldn't eat? Don't!

132
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,698
Come on.

133
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,575
Man.

134
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,659
God.

135
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,955
Is it okay to have food delivered here?

136
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,167
Why not?
The delivery flyer was already here.

137
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,627
The security guys
also have them delivered.

138
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,382
It won't take too much effort.

139
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,011
Don't worry about the NIS bastards.

140
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,388
I'll only kill Cha Dal-geon.

141
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,769
Are you ready?

142
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,981
I thought you'd never ask.

143
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,026
Go get the empty plates.

144
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,071
Along with Cha Dal-geon's head.

145
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,299
I'm here for the plates.

146
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,177
-Wait a moment, please.
-Sure.

147
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,302
My head is killing me.

148
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,304
Maybe food poisoning?

149
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,783
You are...

150
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,146
Where are you?

151
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,736
I guess you didn't even have
a single bite of jajangmyeon.

152
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,574
Weren't you hungry?

153
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,164
You should've ordered jjamppong instead.

154
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,823
Is your head made of stone?

155
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,450
It's fucking hard.

156
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,412
Goodbye, stone head.

157
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,487
Is he dead?

158
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,158
Dal-geon.

159
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,535
Check if he's dead.

160
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,366
CALL HISTORY
UNCLE

161
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,412
Did I kill him? Really?

162
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,790
-Dal-geon--
-Be quiet.

163
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,512
Aren't you going to answer it?

164
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,180
Pardon?

165
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,558
Oh, right.

166
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,564
Okay, what do you have?

167
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,484
Did you get it done in time?

168
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,161
Answer me, you idiot.

169
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,879
What the heck are you saying?

170
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,631
The line is bad. Call me again.

171
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,887
Who was that?

172
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,555
Fuck.

173
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,267
He sounds exactly like Min Jae-sik.

174
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,728
Min Jae-sik?

175
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,565
M?

176
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,656
Who's M?

177
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,909
-Answer it.
-Hey, Go Hae-ri.

178
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,118
Yes, Chief.

179
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,803
-What are you doing?
-Texting to reassure him.

180
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,726
I KILLED CHA DAL...

181
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,271
You're such an amateur.

182
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,111
-Lie on the floor.
-What?

183
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,991
-Lie down.
-Hey. You're scaring me.

184
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,661
I'm not going to jump you. Do it now.

185
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,415
Why?

186
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,542
Is something wrong?

187
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,794
No.

188
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,506
GONG-CHEOL

189
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,844
He's dead. Cha Dal-geon.

190
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,224
-Are you sure?
-I have proof. Want to see?

191
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,269
Shoot, where are my manners?

192
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,647
It's too gruesome for a lady to--

193
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,615
What about O Sang-mi?

194
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,951
Don't worry.

195
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,663
She's acting exactly
according to the script I gave her.

196
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,760
How are you?

197
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,058
I heard you're fluent in Spanish.

198
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:56,356
It was you who Kim Woo-gi talked to
on the phone right before takeoff.

199
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,906
Who are you?

200
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,660
How should I explain who I am
for you to understand?

201
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,081
Well...
Let's say I'm from John &amp; Mark.

202
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,377
In here,

203
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,340
there's a set of very kind instructions
for you to follow.

204
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,467
Learn it thoroughly and do as it says.

205
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,722
Then you can easily get away with
the NIS interrogation.

206
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,355
Does John &amp; Mark want my cooperation?

207
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,067
It won't be cheap.

208
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,863
You can talk about the details later
with an expert on that subject.

209
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,408
Memorize it before going to the NIS.

210
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,119
It's no good putting it off.

211
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,420
I put in a GPS-tracking bug.

212
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,727
Thank you for your cooperation.

213
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,327
I hope we never meet again
for something like this.

214
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,288
Come this way.

215
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,720
TAXI

216
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,975
Where to?

217
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,310
-Just circle around the downtown nearby.
-Come again?

218
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,439
Do a lap around the nearest town.
I'll pay.

219
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,234
Yes, ma'am.

220
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,279
She suspects a tail.

221
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,785
She was quite something
in the interrogation, too.

222
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,621
Maybe she’s always been like that.

223
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:21,168
Or someone inside is helping her.

224
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,502
GO HAE-RI

225
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,964
O Sang-mi is getting in a cab again.

226
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,968
Give me the coordinates.

227
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,851
What?

228
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,603
Are you alone?

229
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,273
What's it about?

230
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,485
I think Min Jae-sik is the mole.

231
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,404
What do you mean?

232
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,826
Get it together and talk to me.

233
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,502
Go Hae-ri, listen very carefully.

234
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,212
Yes.

235
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,506
You got it, sir.

236
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,095
Get out of here with the body.

237
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,390
By myself?

238
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,360
These agents are Min's henchmen.

239
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,575
To deceive them properly,
I have to be here when they wake up.

240
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,443
Go out and meet Chief Gang.

241
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,196
You can trust him.

242
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,782
I'm Cha Dal-geon.
You heard from Hae-ri, right?

243
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,014
Min Jae-sik, you son of a bitch!

244
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,350
Do you know this guy?

245
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,353
You don't need to know.

246
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,980
Excuse me!

247
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,441
I've kept you afloat so far.

248
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,943
Shouldn't you let me in on this?

249
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,698
You want to play alone?

250
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,909
Okay, then.

251
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,828
I'm going to deliver this body to the DA.

252
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,040
Unkillable.

253
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,959
"Unkillable"?

254
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:54,005
It's a secret group of North Korean
defectors from the special forces.

255
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,633
What can we do

256
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,552
now that the economic deal is signed
between the two Koreas?

257
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,098
Unkillable is now like a cancerous tumor.

258
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,849
You should've dismissed them.

259
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,143
Why send them to get killed?

260
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,896
If word got out
about using defectors for black ops,

261
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,606
who'd take the blame?

262
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,066
You? Me?

263
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,734
The Director?

264
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,361
Come on.

265
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,488
North Korea's State Security Department

266
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,116
was apparently
very satisfied with the list.

267
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,453
To get closer to unification,
we need to offer a sacrifice.

268
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,750
Min Jae-sik regrouped Unkillable
after it was dismissed.

269
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,713
Then it's confirmed, right?

270
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,925
That asshole, Min Jae-sik,
is working with John &amp; Mark.

271
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,022
GO HAE-RI

272
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,737
What is it?

273
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,406
It's bad news, sir.
Cha Dal-geon has gone missing.

274
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,699
What?

275
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,076
What the fuck were you doing?

276
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,413
We kind of passed out
after we had some jajangmyeon.

277
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,331
When we woke up...

278
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,167
Oh, there's blood spatter here.

279
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,961
I think an assassin broke in.

280
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,213
Well done.

281
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:21,092
Get Hae-ri out of there,
and then delete the CCTV footage.

282
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,179
It's been all taken care of.

283
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,057
That son of a bitch knows what he's doing.

284
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,977
Make sure Hae-ri doesn't talk.

285
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,229
Tell her
I'll report to the Director myself.

286
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,110
Good.

287
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,696
This is how it should be done.

288
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,531
MR. KIM

289
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,827
-Yes, sir.
-What happened to O Sang-mi?

290
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,497
Her ass is right in front of me.

291
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,458
Don't waste any more time. Take her in.

292
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,709
You got it.

293
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,046
Turn left.

294
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,009
What the fuck?

295
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,220
Let me follow him and cut his throat.

296
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,763
Let him go.

297
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,681
He's one lucky son of a bitch.

298
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,391
How far to the target?

299
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,185
1.5 kilometers.

300
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,812
Something's not right.

301
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,897
-Go faster.
-Alright.

302
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,001
O Sang-mi went into a church
near Hagye station.

303
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,087
Connect me to her bug.

304
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,421
Yes, sir.

305
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,711
THE TRUTH LIES IN O SANG-MI'S HANDS
CAN SHE CLEAR THE SUSPICIONS?

306
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,257
THE NIS INVESTIGATING...
HE IS SUSPECTED TO HAVE USED...

307
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,145
GAIN THE SKIES
WITH THE PRAYERS OF OTHERS

308
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,445
Is it okay to call?
Aren't you under investigation?

309
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,781
Don't worry. Everything is taken care of.

310
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,243
What do you mean? How?

311
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,496
We're not the only ones
who don't want the truth out.

312
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:01,294
You don't trust John &amp; Mark, do you?

313
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,346
You know
I don't trust anything but money.

314
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,806
Did you get every penny
from John &amp; Mark?

315
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,480
Is this part recorded?

316
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,025
Of course. As clear as crystal.

317
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,946
I'll get the rest when the time's right.

318
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,073
Don't you turn your back on me.

319
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,909
You'll get the 5 billion
only if I'm alive.

320
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,827
Things have gone too far.

321
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,081
I need more than just 5 billion.

322
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,223
Hang in there.

323
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,350
The more we wait, the more we can get

324
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,186
because it makes them more anxious.

325
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,380
Get off me!

326
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,925
Get off me!

327
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,301
Get off me!

328
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,636
Shit.

329
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,940
What do you have?

330
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,402
I got a smoking gun
that can nail Kim Woo-gi.

331
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,571
Be more specific.

332
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,407
It's a burner.

333
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,826
They talked to each other
only through this phone.

334
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,418
Hello?

335
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,211
Gi Tae-ung?

336
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,602
Drag her out.

337
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,125
Hello? Gi Tae-ung?

338
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,295
Gi Tae-ung, what's wrong?

339
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,174
Gi Tae-ung! What's going on?

340
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,509
CHIEF GANG

341
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,596
Mr. Gang.

342
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,808
At the spot you were disconnected with Gi,

343
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,393
a car accident has just been reported.

344
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,562
A car accident?

345
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,523
Oh, no!

346
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,568
Give me the coordinates.

347
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,196
And find out where the Director is.

348
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,324
He's not home
and doesn't pick up.

349
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,409
-Hurry!
-Yes, sir.

350
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,122
Pull over!

351
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,132
Isn't that Cha Dal-geon?

00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,192
What did you do to Gong-Cheol?

363
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,738
Answer the question. Where is he?

364
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,577
Where do you think a bad guy would end up?

365
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,788
In hell, obviously.

366
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,498
You son of a bitch.

367
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,460
Don't forget my voice.

368
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,880
I'll personally cut your throat.

369
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,635
Do Su!

370
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,262
You're Kim Do Su, right?

371
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,264
It's Gang Ju-cheol.

372
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,850
Fucking traitor.

373
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,773
UNCLE

374
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,084
Min Jae-sik?

375
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:37,004
Yes, Dal-geon just warned me
that Min may know.

376
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,631
Find his location.

377
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:41,050
-Oka--
-It's urgent. Hurry.

378
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,594
Okay, okay. Everybody's in a hurry today.

379
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,559
I've got him.

380
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:57,566
He's at the nightlife hot spot in Gangnam.

381
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,694
Send me the coordinates.

382
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,754
-Se-hun, are you okay?
-Please get out of the way.

383
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,841
Gi Tae-ung! Do you recognize me?

384
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,676
Tae-ung!

385
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,219
Chief...

386
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,847
Where is O Sang-mi?

387
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,435
Move over.
Come on, move him now!

388
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,960
Excuse me.

389
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,755
Isn't this O Sang-mi's burner?

390
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,258
You're right.

391
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,386
Those bastards didn't know she had it.

392
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,221
Fucking bastards.

393
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,524
-Yes, Mr. Gang.
-What happened to Min Jae-sik?

394
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,860
I found him.

395
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,570
How is Gi?

396
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,449
The ambulance took him.
Where are you?

397
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,409
In Gangnam.

398
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,828
Min will soon find out.

399
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,624
We need to arrest him before he gets away.
Can you do it by yourself?

400
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,709
Don't worry.

401
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,421
I have a gun.

402
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,383
I'll take full responsibility.

403
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,385
If he resists, just shoot him.

404
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,347
-Sir?
-O Sang-mi was taken.

405
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,101
What happened to Tae-ung
wasn't an accident.

406
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,186
Mi Jae-sik is behind it.

407
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,731
He's not even human,

408
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,527
so if it goes south, you may kill him.

409
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,554
Hey, Miss! You can't just barge in here!

410
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,223
I'm looking for my husband.
Get out of my way.

411
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,060
So, Mr. Director.

412
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,854
Did you blow off some steam?

413
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,943
The President called me three times today.

414
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,822
If I don't finish this case soon enough,

415
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,907
I might get the chop.

416
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,954
That's why I invited you
to a place like this, to cheer you up.

417
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,789
Have another drink

418
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,625
and get some rest at home.

419
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,087
Excuse me, sir. Let me get this.

420
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,257
MR. KIM

421
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,675
Damn.

422
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,343
Oh, Kim,

423
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,512
I'm busy now, so--

424
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,972
Gong-Cheol is down.

425
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,976
We're going to lay low with O Sang-mi.
You need to get out, too.

426
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,561
Fuck!

427
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,317
What the...?

428
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,777
What are you doing here?

429
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,950
What the...?

430
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,870
You're under arrest

431
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,582
for covering up the B357 crash
and murdering by proxy.

432
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,501
What the fuck are you doing?

433
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:49,298
He sent a hitman to kill Cha Dal-geon
at the safe house.

434
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:51,967
What's she talking about?

435
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,427
On top of that,

436
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,429
he attempted to kill

437
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,680
Gi Tae-ung--

438
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,891
-Go Hae-ri!
-Don't move.

439
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,059
Or I'll shoot.

440
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,978
What? Shoot me?

441
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,149
I'm your direct supervisor.

442
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,109
What you heard is a fucking rumor.

443
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,861
You destroyed the video

444
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,656
and betrayed your colleagues.

445
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,868
How much did John &amp; Mark fucking give you!

446
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,705
God, what a pain in the ass.

447
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,374
You have three daughters.

448
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,962
Does your dirty money
make your family happy?

449
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,798
-Put the gun down and let's talk first.
-I'm not kidding!

450
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,054
I will shoot you, son of a bitch!

451
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,436
GANG JU-CHEOL

452
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,647
Yes, Gang.

453
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,830
Sir, where are you now?

454
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,919
Fuck.

455
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,217
Damn it.

456
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,699
Are you sober now?

457
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,327
Yes. What about Gi Tae-ung?

458
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,582
The doctor told me that he'll live
and that we don't need to worry.

459
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,501
Thank God.

460
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,880
What about Min Jae-sik?

461
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,216
He's disappeared. His phone is off, too.

462
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,677
The police are helping us find him,

463
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,138
so we'll know soon enough.

464
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,016
It won't be easy to find him.

465
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,147
Damn it.

466
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,362
Shit.

467
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,739
Damn.

468
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,461
Mr. Min?

469
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,387
You're Chief Min Jae-sik, right?

470
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,390
Who are you?

471
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,266
Here.

472
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,269
You want to answer it.

473
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,983
This is Min--

474
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:01,573
Min Jae-sik isn't as bold as he looks.

475
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,160
He'd never act alone

476
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,330
unless he had someone to count on.

477
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,585
Are you saying
he's under some kind of protection?

478
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:19,049
Let me lead the investigation.

479
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:24,054
I will find an answer to every question
from Kim Woo-gi to Min Jae-sik.

480
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,477
-What if you fail?
-You don't like me, right?

481
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,603
I'll quit.

482
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,149
I don't care about your quitting

483
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,360
because I'll get sacked before.

484
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,321
We found a smoking gun.

485
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,783
A smoking gun?

486
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,541
We can find Kim Woo-gi any time now.

487
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,213
From my experience, everything we do
from this point on is very crucial.

488
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,468
An unskilled hunter can fail to catch
even a trapped prey.

489
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,103
Okay, then. I'm giving you full power.

490
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,690
If you fail though,
quitting won't be enough.

491
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,209
Is he still unconscious?

492
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,545
He's asleep with an IV painkiller.

493
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,599
I got a cold wind in my eyes
while running.

494
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,563
Don't worry about Min Jae-sik.
He's on an APB. We'll catch him soon.

495
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,515
Excuse me.

496
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,351
You're not my type.

497
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,854
I like tall, intelligent,
fair-skinned men.

498
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,782
She's got no taste.

499
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,743
He looks like a weasel

500
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,912
with a bad temper.

501
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,584
Dal-geon, you must be hungry.

502
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,325
Oh, no.

503
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,287
I made too much fried rice.

504
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,675
Who is it?

505
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,510
Dal-geon, it's me.

506
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,597
Hae-ri Go?

507
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,228
Ta-da! I've got fried chicken.

508
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:05,484
-Why?
-Why else? Because I'm hungry.

509
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,653
Oh, something smells good!

510
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,488
What is it? Kimchi fried rice?

511
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,657
You must have read my mind.

512
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,575
I had a craving on my way here.

513
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,496
You should've given me a call.
This place is a mess.

514
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,915
It's good that I'm here.

515
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,168
You made a lot. There's ham, too!

516
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,591
TTOBONGEE CHICKEN

517
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,518
You're a good cook.
The seasoning is perfect.

518
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:45,649
I'm not sure we are close enough
for you to come here and eat with me.

519
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,280
-What about Mr. Gi?
-Hwa-suk is there now.

520
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,241
Here, have some.

521
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,797
You want some?

522
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,050
Okay, I'll drink alone.

523
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,387
I want a drink, too.

524
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,685
I don't have soju glasses.
Sip slowly with this.

525
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,357
Here...

526
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,192
you did good today.

527
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,626
What?

528
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,962
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

529
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,341
What's wrong with you?

530
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,846
I'm trying to relax.

531
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,932
Too many things happened today.

532
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,251
Wow, I can't believe she drank all this.

533
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,047
Hae-ri Go!

534
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,884
Where do you live? Let me take you home.

535
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:39,012
No, sir. I can go by myself.

536
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,765
She's plastered.

537
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,184
No, you can't. You're absolutely hammered.

538
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,687
Hae-ri Go, get up. Let's go home.

539
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,576
Do you hate me that much?

540
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,791
Do you really

541
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:11,253
hate me that much, Mr. Gi?

542
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:19,511
What is it about me that you hate so much?

543
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,597
Just tell me what,

544
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,185
and I'll fix it all.

545
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,027
Hae-ri Go!

546
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,865
Wake up. Let's go home and sleep.

547
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,450
Wake up, now.

548
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,077
-Let's go home.
-You!

549
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,750
You're mine.

550
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:53,962
What?

551
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,675
You're mine.

552
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,721
Hey.

553
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,891
Go Hae-ri?

554
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,540
Now you're mine.

555
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,425
Ms. Go Hae-ri?

556
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,969
Hae-ri... Hae-ri Go?

557
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,597
Hae-ri Go.

558
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,849
You shouldn't sleep here.

559
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,229
Hae-ri Go, wake up.

560
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,816
Come here.

561
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,281
A snitch?

562
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,952
It seems Min Jae-sik was bribed
by John &amp; Mark.

563
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,705
He has links with
a high-ranking government official.

564
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:14,292
-Who do you think the official is?
-We're looking into it.

565
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,585
Any evidence of it?

566
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,505
There's no other way to explain--

567
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,215
Come on, Director An.

568
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,219
Are you crazy?

569
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,806
You are reporting to the President
without even evidence?

570
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,350
I was told to report even a small thing.

571
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,186
Still, you need basic facts.

572
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,816
Don't you see
he's tired from so much work?

573
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,027
Just solve the case as soon as possible.

574
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,700
It gives me such a headache.

575
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,201
Yes, Mr. President.

576
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,134
Down.

577
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,681
I'm sorry.

578
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,891
The leash slipped through my fingers.

579
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,354
-You can go now.
-Yes, sir.

580
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,365
This dog is smarter than An.

581
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,995
You should've just bitten him real hard.

582
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,290
Sometimes you need to take the wheel.

583
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:38,752
I've been free from stain
during my term of office.

584
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,712
I don't need a bucket of shit on me now.

585
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,049
Take him away.

586
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:52,182
It's not that you haven't had a stain,
but that you got it cleaned well.

587
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,977
And I was a part of that cleaning crew.

588
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,022
-Master Hong.
-Wow.

589
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,692
I haven't heard that nickname for a while.

590
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,403
Use that special brain of yours

591
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,572
to let me know what to do.

592
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:12,452
I gave you the pictures of Park Man-yeong
for a time like this.

593
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,377
Use the Minister of Defense
as a scapegoat?

594
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,754
That's right.

595
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,881
He can be used as a shield

596
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,092
and he's easy to get rid of.

597
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,510
You should've been

598
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,639
the Director General of the NIS
rather than the Prime Minister.

599
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,060
Then the two Koreas
would've been united already.

600
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,588
REST IN PEACE
FUNERAL DAY 49 OF THE B357 VICTIMS

601
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,143
KANG MI-SEON,
WIFE OF PARK KWANG-DEOK

602
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:26,359
CHA HOON, NEPHEW OF CHA DAL-GEON

603
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:36,661
We officially propose to the government
to find out the cause...

604
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,663
PRESIDENT JEONG GOOK-PYO,
PLEASE KEEP YOUR PROMISE

605
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,166
and the truth of the B357 crash.

606
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,960
President Jeong Gook-pyo

607
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,588
promised to find out the truth
but he has done nothing.

608
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:50,133
And the National Defense Ministry
is working with John &amp; Mark

609
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,010
on the F-X plan.

610
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:55,930
Politicians are not doing anything

611
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,516
like having the national assembly
get to the bottom of it

612
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,352
or enacting a special law
for the investigation.

613
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,565
We don't want the compensation money.

614
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,359
We don't understand...

615
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,944
STAYING SILENT IS ALSO A CRIME

616
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:14,449
why we had to lose our loved ones
and we want this abnormal situation

617
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,119
to be made right.

618
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,622
No money can heal the pain

619
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,542
from losing a family.

620
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,130
We want to know

621
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,758
why we had to lose our loved ones.

622
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:37,305
Please get to the bottom
of the B357 crash.

623
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,434
Please make a special act
so that this kind of tragedy

624
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,312
will never happen again.

625
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,731
Call the NIS about this, anonymously.

626
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,941
You got it.

627
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,610
People of Korea
whose hearts are also broken,

628
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,905
please give us your support

629
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,908
although we couldn't protect...

630
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,914
SEONDEOK JUDO GYM

631
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,875
This is frustrating.
How is the NIS investigation going?

632
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,585
You don't talk to Hae-ri anymore?

633
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,130
She hasn't called me at all.
She must be busy.

634
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,674
I see.

635
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,060
Wait. That guy...

636
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,354
Hmm? What? Who?

637
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,900
I'm Jo Bu-yeong,
a reporter for Pyeonghwa Daily.

638
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,610
Mr. Jo!

639
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,904
He was dead.

640
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,906
Sorry? Who?

641
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,327
Dal-geon. Dal-geon!

642
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,843
Mr. Jo Bu-yeong!

643
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,560
Mr. Jo!

644
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,812
Mr. Jo Bu-yeong!

645
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,863
