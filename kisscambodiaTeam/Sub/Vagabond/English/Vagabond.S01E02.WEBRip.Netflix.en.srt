1
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,369
Was it you?

2
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,748
Why did you crash the plane, you bastard!

3
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,171
Get out, you piece of shit!

4
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,661
The bereft families called us again.

5
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,455
-I'm afraid keeping them waiting--
-I'll be down there in 30 minutes.

6
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,832
I'll get ready.

7
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,352
Do you know how long we've been waiting?

8
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,646
You're outright ignoring us.

9
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,565
They didn't run off, did they?

10
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,984
-Call them right now!
-What's going on?

11
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,111
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

12
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,404
What the hell is this?

13
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,823
-What's going on?
-He should've come down by now.

14
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,075
-You can't do this to us!
-Why won't you answer me?

15
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,327
I apologize.

16
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,999
I'm sorry for being late.

17
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,462
I'm Edward Park,
Chief negotiator of Dynamic System.

18
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,507
-We've lost our children!
-Please stop.

19
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,842
You bastard!

20
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,385
Bring my child back to life!

21
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,762
Bring him back!

22
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,348
Bring my husband back!

23
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,599
Is this a joke?

24
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,975
You killed my little brother!

25
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,644
Bring my husband back to life!

26
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,853
You fucking murderer!

27
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,481
-Mr. Kwang-deok, calm down.
-Get off me!

28
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,649
Hey.

29
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,651
Throw it.

30
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,111
-What?
-Throw it.

31
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,821
Son of a...

32
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,114
Motherfucker...

33
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,253
You can call me names and hit me
all you want.

34
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,839
Show them your anger and grief

35
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,841
in the most expressive way.

36
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,885
What the hell are you talking about?

37
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,720
Dynamic System told me

38
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,723
to settle with you at the lowest cost.

39
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,934
Are you kidding me?

40
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,479
The death toll, 211,
is just a number to them.

41
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,065
But 211 is not only a number,

42
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,150
it's your dear husbands, wives,
and children

43
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,529
who should be smiling by your side.

44
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,864
They need to know this.

45
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,244
Aren't you one of them?

46
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,870
Well, in fact,

47
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,873
A plane crash five years ago...

48
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,046
took my wife and daughter's lives.

49
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,511
It was my daughter's birthday...

50
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,430
but her party was canceled

51
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,100
because I said I was busy.

52
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,520
If only we'd had dinner together
that day...

53
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,772
if we'd had that dinner,

54
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,066
my wife and daughter

55
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,111
wouldn't have been on that plane.

56
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,701
Mi-seon wanted her husband
to have his own Judo gym,

57
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,665
so she sold Gimbap at a joint
till late at night.

58
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,551
Kim Woo-gi, the co-pilot,

59
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,096
his dream was
running a horse ranch in Jeju-do.

60
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,435
He was more at home on land
than in the sky.

61
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,070
Pil-yong was Pil-sun's little brother

62
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,281
whom she raised

63
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,991
like her own son.

64
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,371
Ui-jeong,

65
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,168
Yong-jae, So-dam, Hyeok-jin, Jeong-su...

66
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,129
They were all precious people

67
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,840
who shouldn't be gone like that.

68
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,432
This is terrible.

69
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,439
My job is done.

70
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,358
How much longer should I be here?

71
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,256
I feel this is my last opportunity

72
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,383
to atone to my wife and daughter.

73
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,304
Please support me
in my fight against Dynamic System.

74
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,725
I'll make sure to get whatever you want

75
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,855
from them. I mean it.

76
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,445
Uh, Dal-geon?

77
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,071
-Gosh.
-Dal-geon?

78
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,865
There's a survivor!

79
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,741
This bastard is alive

80
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,161
from the plane crash.

81
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,000
You must be Mr. Cha Dal-geon.

82
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,836
I'm not quite sure what you're saying--

83
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,671
That bastard tried to shoot me!

84
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,219
I know it sounds fucking crazy,

85
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,097
but I clearly saw him.

86
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,516
I really did see him!

87
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,767
Dal-geon,

88
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,936
are you out of your mind?

89
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,688
I'm not crazy.

90
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,398
My head is clear!

91
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,109
I was chasing after him...

92
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,321
This is driving me nuts.

93
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,572
So...

94
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,073
What you're saying is...

95
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,202
-The plane crash was--
-An act of terrorism.

96
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,786
I'm sure of it!

97
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,832
Terror?

98
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,417
What does he mean, a terrorist attack?

99
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,629
The plane exploded when it crashed.
Nobody could survive from that.

100
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,006
That's why this is driving me crazy!

101
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,842
I saw him clearly with my own eyes!

102
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,470
Wait, walk us through it calmly.

103
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,972
-Who did you see and where?
-Right.

104
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,142
There's someone else who saw him
other than me!

105
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,854
She must have...

106
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,694
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

107
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,612
Wait!

108
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,866
Do you remember the guy I told you to stop
at the airport?

109
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,284
Excuse me?

110
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,412
Wait a moment.

111
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,747
Come here!

112
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,291
What?

113
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,632
LOG IN

114
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,977
Look, it's the same guy!

115
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,353
Remember him?

116
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,571
Well...

117
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,452
I'm not sure. It was so hectic
and such a brief moment.

118
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,705
Try harder, please!

119
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,599
I don't remember.

120
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,645
What do you have your head and eyes for?

121
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,523
Why are you yelling at me?

122
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,484
Check the CCTVs at the airport.

123
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,697
You'll believe me when you see it there!

124
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,491
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go to the airport.

125
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,951
-I'll go.
-Okay.

126
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,537
-Sure.
-No way. What kind of nonsense...

127
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,508
Stop! That man right there.

128
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,279
It's not him.

129
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,281
No scar on his face.

130
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,241
You were mistaken.

131
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,786
Ask them to show us a different clip.

132
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,291
This one!

133
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,504
Right there.

134
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,775
What are you doing to us?
We're suffering enough as it is.

135
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,985
I think he made an honest mistake.

136
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,821
Shall we go?

137
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,365
Wait.

138
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,536
That bastard messed with the CCTV.

139
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,620
Mr. Cha Dal-geon.

140
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,664
I saw him with my own two eyes!

141
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,709
I can bet my life on it,

142
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,045
so please believe me!

143
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,966
We don't need your life.
How can you make such a mistake?

144
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,926
We're going through enough already.

145
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,305
These things can be manipulated easily,
don't you think?

146
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,934
They crashed a plane.
For them, this is a piece of cake!

147
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,353
"Manipulated"? Manipulated, my ass!

148
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,231
Forget it.
Fighting among us wouldn't look good.

149
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,941
We're on a tight schedule.

150
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,401
Let's go.

151
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,698
Hey,

152
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,826
I run a Judo gym.

153
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,370
Because of that I'm very patient.

154
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,832
They suffered enough from their loss.

155
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,709
Don't add to the pain, okay?

156
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,649
His name is Cha Dal-geon.

157
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,361
A member of his family died
on flight B357.

158
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,612
What is he?

159
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,323
FBI? NIS?

160
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,574
He's a stuntman.

161
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,663
A stuntman?

162
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,668
Samael is looking for you.

163
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,678
SAMAEL JOINED THE CHAT.

164
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,772
If you keep disobeying his orders,
you are as good as dead.

165
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,733
I value my honor over my life.

166
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,571
I won't go back until it is restored.

167
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,035
I can't help you.

168
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,081
Don't worry, Busra.
There's someone to help me.

169
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,607
WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN OR SAVE THIS FILE?
SAVE

170
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,529
SAVING FILE

171
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,911
Ho-sik? It's Cha Dal-geon.

172
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,996
Do you know where Go Hae-ri is staying?

173
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,581
Why do you ask?

174
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,001
I have to give her something
but she's not picking up.

175
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,010
Ms. Go Hae-ri!

176
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,389
Ms. Go!

177
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,770
Ms. Go!

178
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,022
Ms. Go Hae-ri!

179
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,464
-Go Hae-ri?
-What are you doing here?

180
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,800
Are you one of them?

181
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,220
-What?
-Who are you?

182
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,182
Who the hell are you?

183
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,107
Answer the question.
Who are you really?

184
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,199
So...

185
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,202
you think I'm working with the terrorist?

186
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,039
Are you out of your mind?

187
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,082
What do you think I--?

188
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,712
Where is he?

189
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,007
-Cha Dal-geon, look.
-I'm not my fucking self!

190
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,051
Talk, or I'll blow your brains out.

191
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,306
Then shoot me.

192
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,642
-What?
-You're obviously crazy.

193
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,688
-Pull the trigger. Do it!
-Shut up!

194
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,614
I understand you've lost your mind,

195
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,700
but how can you treat me like a terrorist?

196
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,454
What are you doing? Let me go!

197
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,664
-You crazy bast--
-Don't move.

198
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,209
You want to be in big trouble?

199
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,502
You'll regret this--

200
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,129
-It hurts!
-Don't move!

201
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,772
Don't you know what serious crimes
you're committing?

202
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,693
Breaking and entering,
unlawful detainment, and intimidation!

203
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,709
Don't!

204
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,586
Don't you touch it.

205
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,555
What a pervert.

206
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,224
And now, sexual harassment.

207
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,279
Sheesh.

208
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,958
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

209
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,793
What is this?

210
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,255
National Intelligence Service?

211
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,132
Now that you know, untie me.

212
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,385
I told you you'd be in trouble.

213
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,681
My gosh.
Blowing my cover will get me disciplined!

214
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,019
Untie me now!

215
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,189
-Plenty of props like this on set.
-What?

216
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,191
Want to see mine, too? I'm CIA.

217
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,028
I am a special agent from the NIS.

218
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,489
How special are you now
all tied up and disarmed?

219
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,783
I can speak three languages.

220
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,328
You think we only have muscle at the NIS?

221
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,872
Smart agents like me are more special!

222
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,457
Get your facts straight!

223
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,511
-Who's M?
-Don't answer it.

224
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,555
Or else, I'll be fired.

225
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,475
Answer it.

226
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,354
Hey, Go Hae-ri.

227
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,231
Damn it.

228
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,609
Hello?

229
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,113
Yes, Chief.

230
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,659
Ambassador O Jae-gwan
was arrested upon his arrival in Korea.

231
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,452
Good job.

232
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,331
By the way, when can I return

233
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,667
to the National Intelligence Service?

234
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,336
Stay there for the time being.

235
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,380
Things are working great without you here.

236
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,925
Sir, how can you say such hurtful words?

237
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:00,842
NIS CHIEF MIN JAE-SIK

238
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,721
Nobody could've handled
the ambassador case as well as me.

239
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,307
You didn't do it alone.

240
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,852
Only an idiot cannot finish
a job wrapped up in a bow.

241
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,731
I wrapped it up.
What others did was just cuffing him.

242
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,859
Anyways, I'm getting my ticket home.

243
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,529
Unless you want to be disciplined
for leaving your post,

244
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,155
stay put.

245
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,408
Hello?

246
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,326
Sir? Chief--

247
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,709
Now you know I'm not lying?

248
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,696
Let's call it even
although I got the short end.

249
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,443
Why did you come here?

250
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,862
You must have a reason
to look for me late at night.

251
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,034
It's the video

252
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,328
taken before the crash.

253
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,499
Watch it and try to remember the bastard.
You said you were smart.

254
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,585
Look, Mr. Cha Dal-geon.

255
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,962
I'm a busy person

256
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,380
and I owe you nothing.

257
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,132
You're responsible, too!

258
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,176
What do you mean?

259
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,055
Check this out.

260
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,517
Here, your precious name, Go Hae-ri!

261
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,643
STAFF IN CHARGE: GO HAE-RI

262
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,902
This is just
because I'm the staff in charge.

263
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,986
Exactly!

264
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,033
I need your help.

265
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,411
I beg you.

266
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,246
Stay seated.

267
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,437
STAFF IN CHARGE: GO HAE-RI

268
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,606
You're responsible, too!

269
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,152
Asshole.

270
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,447
Talking gibberish like that.

271
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,428
I know you threw away your books.
You got busted.

272
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,348
I brought them back home.

273
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,850
They were so heavy.

274
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,355
Why did you quit the Action Center?

275
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,869
Hae-ri Go!

276
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,497
I heard you scored big this time.

277
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,249
Hwa-suk, where are you?

278
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,126
Where else? At the office.

279
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,796
I sent a video to your personal email.
I want you to check it.

280
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,214
What video?

281
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,217
Is it X-rated?

282
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,512
CHECK THIS AUDIO PLEASE

283
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,599
What is this?

284
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,560
Open it.

285
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,443
Oh my.

286
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,029
Isn't it from the crashed plane--

287
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,032
Can you see a guy on the phone
behind the kids?

288
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,366
The one in a hoodie.

289
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,660
Find out what he's saying on the phone.

290
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,581
Why did you quit the Action Center?

291
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,667
You said you'd become
a famous martial arts director

292
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,377
and go to Hollywood.

293
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,005
It'll take a while to receive approval.

294
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,550
There's no time.
Just remove any trace of the email.

295
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,136
Gosh... Okay, girl.

296
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,639
You should be spending your energy
on good looking guys over there instead.

297
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,932
This call costs a lot.

298
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,976
I got to go. Thank you.

299
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,062
Hello?

300
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,356
You're not welcome at all.

301
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,239
SAVING FILE

302
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,785
DELETE

303
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,714
Hello, Mr. Prime Minister.

304
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,550
-I loved your press briefing this morning.
-Thank you.

305
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,844
-Where's Mr. President?
-In his office.

306
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,555
He's in a bad mood.

307
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,641
Okay.

308
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,477
F-X PLAN EVALUATION REPORT
MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

309
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,523
JEONG GOOK-PYO
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

310
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,860
THE MOST PROMISING MODEL IS THE F70.

311
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,619
I can wait outside if you're busy.

312
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,496
It's okay. Come and take a seat.

313
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,173
HONG SUN-JO
PRIME MINISTER

314
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,633
The price aside,

315
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,468
in terms of performance
and technology transfer,

316
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,928
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

317
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,681
Dynamic's F70 is deemed to be superior
to John &amp; Mark's.

318
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,100
What about public opinion, Mr. Minister?

319
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,309
SENIOR SECRETARY FOR CIVIL AFFAIRS

320
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,645
Are you sure
you can handle public opposition

321
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,731
to the deal with Dynamic System?

322
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,775
Still, you cannot make a hasty decision
on such a long-range project.

323
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,946
After the crash, the approval rating
for the President is plummeting,

324
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,990
and you want to add fuel to it?

325
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,325
That's why I'm telling you.

326
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,120
If word gets out
that we wasted north of a trillion won--

327
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,667
What is this display?

328
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,132
Minister Park.

329
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,635
Let's think this way.

330
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,512
For this F-X plan,

331
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,974
a huge sum of money was allocated,
11 trillion won to be exact.

332
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,934
Where do you think it comes from?

333
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,022
It's the tax
from the citizens' hard-earned money.

334
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,440
What would you do

335
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:39,736
if that money makes them sad
rather than happy?

336
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,405
Our national defense is important.

337
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,908
So is the long-range plan.

338
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,328
But aren't they supposed
to make the citizens happy?

339
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,332
I'm just representing
the National Defense Ministry.

340
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,917
For the citizens,

341
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,129
please consider carefully
which is the right decision.

342
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,133
Alright.

343
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,596
I will make careful consideration.
You may go now.

344
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,242
What the fuck does he think he is,
telling me what to do?

345
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:32,497
It was you who appointed
a good Defense Minister like him.

346
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,123
Are you mocking me?

347
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,126
I told you when you appointed him

348
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,796
a surprising number of soldiers
are upright

349
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,673
but few are reliable.

350
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,133
Don't you remember?

351
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:48,012
How can I convince that bullhead
to be on my side?

352
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,515
You cannot change people.

353
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,350
It's better to sack them.

354
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,519
You think I don't know?

355
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,729
It's bad timing.

356
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,108
You're not the one to wait
for the right timing.

357
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,653
To clear my head,

358
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,572
let's play go.

359
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,245
The families are having
a memorial service in Morocco today.

360
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,705
So what?

361
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,084
What does it have to do with playing go?

362
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,921
Nothing. I'm just saying.

363
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,425
The black is yours today
since I won big last time.

364
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,094
I can do whatever I want
while at the Blue House.

365
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,602
I should report you to the FTC
for abusing your power.

366
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,271
If you lose today,
you'll be black next time.

367
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,904
Mom...

368
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,363
Jin-ho.

369
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,760
I bet you can't even rest in peace
but I can't even hold you.

370
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:13,181
I miss you so much, my love.
I can't believe you're gone.

371
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,018
It's daddy's fault, my son!

372
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,729
Honey, please!

373
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,190
I'm begging you, Honey!

374
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,614
Jin-ho!

375
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,284
Honey!

376
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,576
Hoon!

377
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,664
Hoon, I'm sorry!

378
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,626
Hoon!

379
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,397
Hoon!

380
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,539
Due to the crash of B357,

381
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,043
the Korean public is in shock and grief.

382
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,252
Some even argue that

383
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:10,923
Dynamic System, the manufacturer,
shouldn't participate in the bidding.

384
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,800
What do you say about this?

385
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,065
Avionics are like the head of a plane,

386
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,525
and an engine can
be compared to the heart.

387
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,946
The B357 manufactured by Dynamic System

388
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,907
had malfunctioning avionics,

389
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,201
and its engine exploded.

390
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,995
A soldier
with a malfunctioning head and heart

391
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,831
can never win a battle.

392
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,541
That's all I will say.

393
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,178
Hey, Chief Gang.

394
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,138
What a surprise.

395
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,807
What are you doing here?

396
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,142
Aren't you too old to play with planes?

397
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,353
Then are you here
because you played with a plane?

398
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,231
What's with the sharp comeback?

399
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,275
Oh, is it because of the transfer order?

400
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,988
What's wrong with
the Psychological Intelligence Department?

401
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,573
Monitoring the media

402
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,867
and checking typos on documents
are all you need to do.

403
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,536
Get your annoying face out of here.

404
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,498
Man. You stink of alcohol.

405
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,084
Drinking again during the day?

406
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,003
That's why the Director General
doesn't like you

407
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,464
because you're a disgrace to the NIS.

408
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,341
Get the hell out.

409
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,178
I'm telling you because I'm your friend.

410
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,265
How can I give you advice
when you're not ready to listen?

411
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,726
Stop being ma--
Oh, Mr. Senior Secretary Yun?

412
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,148
I went to our hometown last week
for an alumni union.

413
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,151
There, you were
as popular as an idol star.

414
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,194
It's because you're the first
in our tiny town

415
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,572
to become Senior Secretary
to the President for Civil Affairs.

416
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,324
Had dinner yet? Do you care for Sushi?

417
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,619
There's a place nearby I go often
and they specialize in wild fish.

418
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,663
It's really yummy. Let's go.

419
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,168
GO HAE-RI

420
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,171
Why do you want to see the black box?

421
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,923
I'll tell you
if you promise you won't get mad.

422
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,425
Then don't. I'll get mad.

423
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,801
Some say...

424
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,805
there's a survivor
among the passengers.

425
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,973
What?

426
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,186
Tell that bullshit to Chief Min.

427
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,396
Why call me
instead of your direct supervisor?

428
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:34,025
You said you knew someone at the ICAO.

429
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,361
-I'm going to hang up now.
-Don't do this to me, sir.

430
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,656
I went to Lisbon for you.

431
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,618
Do you know how hard it was,
soaking wet and everything?

432
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,913
One good turn deserves another.

433
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,415
Don't be a cold fish.

434
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,875
All right.

435
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,837
I'll see what I can do,
but don't get your hopes up.

436
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,131
Thank you, sir.

437
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,383
By the way,

438
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,761
any results from the autopsy yet?

439
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,888
He killed himself, right?

440
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,057
Something isn't right.

441
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,476
He wasn't the suicidal type at all.

442
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,770
I got to go.

443
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,898
Excuse me.

444
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,277
I'm Gang Ju-cheol. I called you earlier.

445
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,572
Right, nice to meet you.

446
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,866
You're a friend of Michael's, right?

447
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,076
That's right.

448
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,537
I have a question about him.

449
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,916
I can only spare five minutes
due to the tight schedule.

450
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,170
Michael's wife
hasn't been answering the phone.

451
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,591
Do you know why he killed himself?

452
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,221
It's not something I can share with you.

453
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,557
How well did you know Michael?

454
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,769
He helped me a lot
when he was with the CIA.

455
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,023
Michael had a problem...

456
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,026
with his lady friends.

457
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,446
Do you know who they are
and what kind of problems?

458
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,033
Well, to respect his privacy,
I can't tell you anymore.

459
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,660
I'm sorry.

460
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,674
Putting this on will help you
with motion sickness.

461
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,925
Thank you.

462
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,429
You said you have an upset stomach?

463
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,598
This is something I take,
and it works really well.

464
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,144
Take one now
and maybe another on the plane.

465
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,437
Thank you for everything.

466
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,105
Is everyone here?

467
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,610
I don't see Mr. Cha Dal-geon.

468
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,821
He decided to stay here
to catch the terrorist.

469
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,365
He went back on his own.

470
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,826
It's time to go.

471
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,994
Thank you for your service.

472
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,207
-Thank you.
-Goodbye, sir.

473
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,168
This way, please.

474
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,763
O-chan, it's me.

475
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,016
I'm sending you a video now,
spread it online.

476
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,479
What the...?

477
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,073
Mr. Cha Dal-geon!

478
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,284
What is it? What's wrong?

479
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,620
Hoon's videos from the cloud are all gone!

480
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,704
What?

481
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,539
Maybe they were accidentally deleted?

482
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,258
-What the...?
-Shit.

483
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,182
Dal-geon!

484
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,520
No!

485
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,555
Stop right there!

486
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,963
Get over here!

487
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,676
Who sent you? Tell me!

488
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,095
Why are you doing this?

489
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,598
I don't know anything!

490
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,392
Let me live! I don't know anything!

491
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,518
Plane!

492
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,354
Let me live! I don't know anything!

493
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,772
What the fuck are you saying?

494
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,857
Get over here, damn it.

495
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,234
Tell me now!

496
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,862
Speak in fucking English!

497
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,157
Tell me now, or you're fucking dead!

498
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,451
Do you want to fucking die?

499
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,871
-Freeze!
-Let him go!

500
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,876
Let go of me!

501
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,046
Not me!
Arrest that motherfucker, you idiots!

502
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,465
Arrest him, not me!

503
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,591
Let me go!

504
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,720
Ah...

505
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,349
Can you hear something?

506
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,433
Give me a second.

507
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,354
You got busted.

508
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,440
-The person next to...
-I brought them home.

509
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,946
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

510
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,076
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

511
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,495
I can hear a bit...

512
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,957
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

513
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,833
It doesn't sound Korean.

514
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,795
-Excuse me?
-I think it's Spanish.

515
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,297
-Give me that.
-Sure.

516
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,428
-Why did you quit the Action Center?
-Set your watch.

517
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,639
-You said you'd become...
-To the current time, 11...

518
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,099
-From the beginning.
-Okay.

519
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,476
-The person next to...
-I brought them back home.

520
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,394
Okay?

521
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,231
-Why did you quit the Action Center?
-Set your watch.

522
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,732
You said you'd be famous...

523
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,776
-...and go to Hollywood.
-Seven...

524
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,904
-Is it authorized to do--
-Hush. Hold on.

525
00:42:55,364 --> 00:43:00,494
-Precisely in 14 hours and 37 minutes.
-You're the coolest when doing stunts.

526
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,454
-...sorry I got mad at you.
-And the gift?

527
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,047
Hello?

528
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,966
I got his phone conversation.

529
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,514
-What did he say?
-I can't understand at all.

530
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,476
The man from the video spoke Spanish.

531
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,520
Spanish?

532
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,939
I'll read it to you. Write it down.

533
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,737
Hwa-suk, text it to me. Thank you.

534
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,657
She's such a pain in the neck.

535
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,539
-Who is it?
-It's me.

536
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,294
What are you doing here so early?

537
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,088
Cha Dal-geon is in police custody.

538
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,298
What?

539
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,301
What did he do this time?

540
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,847
-Just follow me.
-I know the way.

541
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,600
-Good. Drive safely.
-Thank you.

542
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,747
Hoon hasn't spoken a word
for more than two months.

543
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,291
The doctor said that

544
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:55,002
it's not that he couldn't,
but that he wouldn't.

545
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,587
Couldn't you reach his mom?

546
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,423
No, that's why we called you, his uncle.

547
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:02,885
So...

548
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:04,928
you want me to take him?

549
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,931
-You're his family.
-Family, my ass...

550
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,813
I can't.

551
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,982
My life is hard enough.
I can't raise a kid.

552
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:20,194
-We're closing down soon.
-Find another orphanage...

553
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,908
Find another orphanage for him, then.

554
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,160
Do it yourself.

555
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,455
Hey. Hey!

556
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,874
Shit.

557
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,633
Lift up your arm.

558
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,221
Don't you miss your mom?

559
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,933
I'll find her soon
and you can stay with her.

560
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,852
My mom abandoned me.

561
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,483
Will you abandon me, too, uncle?

562
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,653
Who says you can't speak?

563
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,988
If you're going to abandon me,
then do it now.

564
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,493
Family isn't like a piece of junk
you can throw away or pick up.

565
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,997
Family is...

566
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,586
people living under the same roof.

567
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,755
Family, my ass!

568
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,049
Who told you to pick up bad words first?

569
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,887
Who told you to learn such a bad word?

570
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,307
-Stop it.
-Oh! What's this?

571
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,309
You want to fight with me?

572
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,477
Want to fight?

573
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,854
Oh, okay. I won't let you!

574
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,147
Okay, you win.

575
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,025
I surrender, I surrender!

576
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,654
Got you.

577
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,104
You are free to go.

578
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,337
We will now begin the interrogation.

579
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,424
Was anything else stolen
besides the laptop?

580
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,053
Tell them he's with the one
who crashed the plane.

581
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,431
I don't think that's a good idea.

582
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,641
Just tell them.

583
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,773
The man who crashed the plane
and this man are working together.

584
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:14,201
He went to clean your room
and found it tossed, so he got out.

585
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,703
Don't fucking lie to me!

586
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,253
He's mad because you punched him
out of nowhere.

587
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,256
You bastard!

588
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,884
Ah! you motherfucker...

589
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,762
Dal-geon, it's no use getting worked up.

590
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,481
This man is a cleaner at the hotel,
and they've checked his identity.

591
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,900
Then the hotel is in it together.

592
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:49,986
Mr. Cha Dal-geon.

593
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,321
Translate it, now!

594
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,367
I can't. Why don't you, please?

595
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,202
Damn it...

596
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,174
-Why are they uncuffing him?
-Dal-geon, because--

597
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,136
He's being released,
and you're going back to jail.

598
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,346
What are you talking about? No!

599
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,474
Shit.

600
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,394
Let me go!

601
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,522
Dal-geon! Hey!

602
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,569
What are you doing?

603
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,195
Translate it to him.

604
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,655
I have 18 degrees in martial arts.

605
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,532
It won't take me a second to kill!

606
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,745
So tell me now
that you're with that terrorist!

607
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:43,874
That's enough, Mr. Cha Dal-geon.
You want to rot your life away in jail?

608
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,251
She's right. This is not the way.

609
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,175
He'll shoot you on three
unless you let him go!

610
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,887
Still not talking?
Let's die together, then.

611
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,807
They don't lie about shooting!

612
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,476
Say it!

613
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,782
He says...

614
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,492
they'll shoot me, too.

615
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:23,663
You're gonna get me killed, asshole!

616
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,304
Damn it!

617
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,470
Yes, Chief.

618
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,556
Go to the ICAO secretariat,

619
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,683
and look for Doctor Kevin Kim.

620
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,226
He'll show you the black box.

621
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,855
He's a Korean American working with us.

622
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,900
Are you there?

623
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,903
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.

624
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,240
You asked me to jump
through hoops for nothing?

625
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,033
I'm sorry, sir.

626
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,103
I got no time to lose. Get me out of here.

627
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,149
I did everything I could.
I won't help you anymore.

628
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,192
What if I've been telling you the truth?

629
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:20,739
Then you're becoming an accomplice
to the terrorist. Understand?

630
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,451
Shit. He's driving me crazy.

631
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,534
Welcome.

632
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,540
-I'm Go Hae-ri.
-Yes, I know. I'm Kevin Kim.

633
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:21,174
We retrieved two black boxes
from the plane.

634
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:27,263
They have the voice recording device
containing the cockpit conversation,

635
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,975
and the plane computer data recording.

636
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,651
What's up with all those kids?

637
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,569
It's a taekwondo demo team.

638
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,863
Oh, a national team?

639
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,657
We'd better do our best.

640
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,661
-May I take this call?
-Sure.

641
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:54,332
Honey, I have been waiting for your call.

642
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,710
Can you speak Spanish as well?

643
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,921
Don't worry, he doesn't understand
what we're talking about.

644
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,840
Doctor, do you speak Spanish?

645
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,050
I got it translated.

646
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,891
He seems to be talking
with his girlfriend.

647
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,686
OK, hold on.

648
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:18,648
I've synchronized my watch.

649
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:24,029
The man from the video spoke Spanish.

650
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,656
Honey, I have been waiting for your call.

651
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:13,411
Don't worry, he doesn't understand
what we're talking about.

652
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,956
-Why did you quit the Action Center?
-Set your watch.

653
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,462
To the current time, 11:02 a.m.
Seven, eight, nine seconds.

654
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:26,800
Okay, one moment. I got it.

655
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,135
When can I see you?

656
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,932
Precisely in 14 hours
and 37 minutes from now.

657
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,560
-And the gift?
-It's ready.

658
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,354
You'll find it at the meeting point.

659
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,189
What about our date?

660
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,527
They are set for 13:15, 13:20,

661
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,612
13:23,

662
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,322
13:30.

663
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,657
I got it.

664
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,200
Anything else you need?

665
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,993
No, it's fine.

666
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,621
I love you, darling.

667
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,129
It seems like
they're talking to each other.

668
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,381
It surely does.

669
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:09,717
But if one of them is the co-pilot,

670
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,053
then who's the other one?

671
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,236
You are free to go.

672
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:41,666
-What happened?
-I spent 1,500 euros.

673
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:44,127
I could've got it down to 1,000.

674
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,966
-Did you bribe them?
-What else could I do?

675
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:56,347
This is my bank account,
so send 1,500 euros to here.

676
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,811
You'd better do it.

677
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,398
That douchebag was right.

678
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,108
Excuse me?

679
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,154
The B357 crash was...

680
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,950
an act of terrorism.

681
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,957
Why do you want to join the NIS?

682
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,465
My dad was a colonel in the Marine Corps.

683
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,759
There was a fire during training,

684
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,929
and he died saving eight of his men.

685
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,892
I want to follow his noble path
and serve my country--

686
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,185
Boring.

687
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,605
Excuse me?

688
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,399
Most applicants give me the same answer.

689
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,449
I'm the daughter of
a man of national merit.

690
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,495
Doubting my patriotism
seems an insult to my dad--

691
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,205
He was worried about you.

692
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,001
Colonel Go Gang-cheol,
Chief of First Division, the Marine Corps.

693
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,130
Do you know my dad personally?

694
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,757
I'm one of those eight

695
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,968
whom he saved.

696
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,347
Oh, I see.

697
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,808
What a coincidence.

698
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,857
I wasn't going to tell you this,

699
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,736
but my mom fell victim to fraud

700
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,949
when she bought a part of
a shopping center not long ago.

701
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:41,703
We only have a house left
which is put up for auction.

702
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,872
And my brother failed
to enter a university and decided--

703
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,457
We're done here.

704
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,794
I'm a young breadwinner.

705
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,629
You said my dad saved your life.

706
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:56,092
If I don't get this job,
my family has to be out on the street--

707
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,807
