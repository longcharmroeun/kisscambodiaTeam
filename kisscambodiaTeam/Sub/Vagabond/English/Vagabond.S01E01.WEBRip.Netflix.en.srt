91
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,921
However, given the critical situation

92
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,215
on the Korean Peninsula,

MICHAEL ALMEIDA
VICE PRESIDENT JOHN & MARK ASIA

94
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:15,263
I'm sure to apply for the F-15 Eagle

F-15 Eagle John & Mark

103
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,793
spend about 200 billion
for one plane.

104
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,378
So, at a cost of seven F-15s,

105
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,256
you can operate
our ten Fokker 70s.

106
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,802
One of the most important criteria
that must be considered

107
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,639
is proven reliability
and the cost.

00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,883
I can't even pay dues
to the taxi company.

119
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,593
Out

120
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,305
- Really won't come back?
- Don't discuss anymore. I really stopped.

121
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,599
However, your ideals
become a martial arts director.

122
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,769
After all your difficulties,
will you give up?

123
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,062
I'm annoyed for wasting time.

124
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,482
If it stops early,
I might now have savings.

125
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,692
Damn it.
- Gosh.

126
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,318
Go. I don't want to be seen.

127
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,280
Dal-geon. We never
do it for money, right?

128
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,365
Dream. Hope.

129
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,908
Vision. Correct?

130
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,744
If I die on location,

131
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,789
will you take care of my niece
to be a visionary man?

132
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,917
- What vision?
- I mean is...

133
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,878
HOONI

134
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,340
- Yes, Hoon?
<i> - Where are you? </i>

135
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,509
Certainly on location.

136
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,928
Gosh, the drab here today.

137
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,722
They cut off water.

138
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,475
If tomorrow doesn't pay the bill,
the gas will also be cut off.

139
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,439
<i> Don't worry I'll pay tomorrow</i>

140
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,524
Pay with what?

141
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,360
What again? The replacement actor gets money
from dangerous scenes.

142
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,571
<i> However, it is not yet payday. </i>

143
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,450
In fact,
I got the role of dialogue this time.

144
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,827
The pay is more than usual.

145
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,121
- We start recording again!
- Well!

146
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,125

Jeez. He asked a lot.

148

Borrow money. I'll change it next week.

149
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,217
- Next week?
- Yup.

150
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,220
I know I can count on you.

151
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,429
Save the change.

152
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,390

153
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,977
- Hey come on.
- Stop it.

154
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,646
- You cheapskate!
- I go.

155
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,272
- See you later!
Hey!

156
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,864
Gosh, he drank more.

157
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,325
I hope he stops drinking.

158
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,329

00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:14,395
- So it's all free, right?
- Only flights and hotels are free.

178
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,272
We have to pay expenses.

179
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,527
You think I can't?

180
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,530
You're only 11 years old.

181
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,115
Act like a child.

182
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,327
You should beg to be allowed to go,
don't worry about the money.

183
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,954
Then you have to be mature!

184
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,124
Why yell at me?

185
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,542
You don't know anything.

186
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,837
- What?
- You are stupid...

187
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,799
Stupid? What do I not know?

188
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,592
Hey, Hoon!

189
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,806
He underestimated his uncle lately.

190
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,391
Just you wait, kid!

191
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,309
I will make a lot of money,

192
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,895
feed you meat every day,
and buy expensive clothes.

193
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,524
I will follow along and buy you
anything until you're satisfied.

194
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,239
Isn't this great?

This is an important event to celebrate

So, prepare yourself.

Well.

204
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,795
Good morning! You arrived early.

205
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,924
There was an accident outside.

206
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,802
A motorcyclist fell
in front of my car.

207
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,096
My heart is still pounding.

208
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,681
Miss Go.

This is the demo team schedule

213
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,820
The meeting is over.

214
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,407
OK.

215
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,284
Sorry, Sir.

216
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,290
Answer it.

217
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,668
Mother, I'll call again later.

218
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,340
Moroccan journalists waiting outside.

219
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,176
If it's incompetent,
at least act wisely.

220
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,929
I just saw an apprentice who was so negligent.

221
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,891
Sorry.

222
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,185
You...

223
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,117
This is Elsa.

224
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,747
I'll take it and send it immediately.

225
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,217
Gosh, it's locked again.

226
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,435
What...

227
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,647
What are you doing alone locking yourself up?

228
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,611
My set is torn.

229
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,739
I will leave soon
after replacing it.

230
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,285
You did many things today.

231
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,496
Quickly replace and exit.

232
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,733
- Not easy?
- No, ma'am.

233
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,236
Our offer is one trillion won
higher than Dynamic System

234
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,073
and evaluation of Fokker 70's performance
better than our F-15.

235
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,452
So? How exactly
the Blue House response?

236
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,706
The President wants to support us,
but cannot ignore public opinion.

237
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,501
What are we lobbying for? Is not that
so they ignore things like that?

238
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,420
You know what kind of president.

239
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,881
He is too careful.

241
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,301
That's not careful. That's sneaky.

242
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,803
He only cares about the benefits.

243
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,433
The Blue House is still impenetrable?

244
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,519
Yes ma'am.

245
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,688
We lost the offer, so we are finished.

246
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,525
Make it still accessible
until all of this is settled.

247
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,329
Michael, you know

248
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,999
why I made a normal seller
like yourself being vice president?

249
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,837
Because you work for the CIA.

250
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,674
I'm not fit to be a CIA.

251
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,426
That's why I was fired.

252
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:41,722
Not enough.

253
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,558
Not at all.

254
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:49,271
You just haven't gotten a chance
to prove who you really are.

255
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,984
Do you know

256
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,530
I have to go through to get here,
be me now?

257
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,157
Yes I know.

258
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,660
We have to get this agreement.
however.

259
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,621
If not,

260
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,083
our history is finished.

261
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,628
You and me, done!

262
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,464
Understand?

263
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,302
ONE WEEK THEN, SEOUL

264
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,431
Perfect! The egg yolk doesn't break.

265
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,724
Let's eat!

266
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,016
Do not want.

267
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,229
Eat it. I'll take you to the airport.

268
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,857
Nope. I took the team bus.

269
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,610
Hey, Hoon.

270
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,572
Why do you always scowl lately?

271
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,949
Because of sneakers?

272
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,120
I said I'd buy the best shoes
after you returned from Morocco.

273
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,747
Hey!

274
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
Raised you that
stressful enough.

275
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,254
- At least you can listen to me.
- I regret living with you too.

276
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,089
Then go back to the orphanage!

277
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,512
I mean ...

278
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,142
How do I know what the problem is
if you are reluctant to talk to me?

279
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,269
Look at you, shut up and grunt.

280
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,564
You can not hope
I know the problem. Stop.

281
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,860
I still don't understand, but I'm sorry.

282
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,988
So eat this before it gets cold.

283
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,576
Last chance.

284
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,827
If you don't want to eat,

285
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,914
just for me.

286
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,373
Do not want?

287
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,666
One.

288
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,335
Two.

289
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,171
OK.

290
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,507
It's hot!

291
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,426
Hey, Hoon!

292
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,552
Hoon!

293
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,851
Fussy kid. No wonder he is my nephew

294
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,400
I shouldn't have waited for her birthday
to buy him shoes.

I am worried.

312
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,198
Do not worry. I did not go alone.
This is a group tour.

313
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,242
Not you. I worry about myself.

314
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,703
How can I live without you
for several weeks?

315
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,787
Jeez.

316
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,707
Are you that happy?

317
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,501
I am pregnant.

318
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,379
- What?
- It's been five weeks.

319
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,632
I will be a father?

320
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:09,675
- Yup.
- Really?

321
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,011
I'm now a father!

322
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,723
- Put me down.
- Sorry.

323
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,099
- You make me blush.
- Why?

324
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,394
Hey, your passport. Seriously.

325
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,980
How did you get abroad
without a passport?

326
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,275
You really can keep up
all those children?

327
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,027
Shut up They can hear.

328
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,238
- I'm an instructor.
- Whatever. Pay for transportation money.

329
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,574
You yelp your brother? You are not playing.

330
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,118
I also asked for payment
for the provisions I prepared.

331
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,413
Yes please. You snatched everything
from your only brother.

332
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,290
Hey!

333
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,375

Uncle, I'm on a plane now.

336
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,517
I doubt you miss me,
but if you miss,

00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,352
check the cloud.

338
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,521

<i> Can I know who this is? </i>

348
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,493
There is no time. If you don't stop it
the plane now ...

Where is the fire?

353
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,856
Fire!

Hang in there, Park!

- Good, Sir.

359
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,225
- Don't go to the naming place!
Hello.

360
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,186
We still don't know the sex of the baby.

361
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,646
Attention! Make sure who is sitting
next to you.

So, send the name via message.

You two, give me your cellphone.
The door will be closed, Hoon. Sit down

00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,495
Sit and stay in place.

Come in

370
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,340
You pushed me first.

371
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,675
- Come in and sit down.
- You pushed me first.

372
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,016
Why are there so many kids?

373
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,477
They are a taekwondo demo team.

374
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,312
National team?

375
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,481
We must do our best.

376
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,484
- Can I accept?
- Of course.

377
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,487
Dear...

378
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,114
I'm waiting for your call.

379
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,325
Are you fluent in Spanish?

380
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,372
Do not worry,
he doesn't understand our conversation.

381
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,528

384
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,168
It is such a coincidence.

385
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,753
Why did you come here?

386
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,505
There is a friend of mine who came from Spain.

387
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,302
- You haven't heard the news, right?
- What news?

388
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,306
National Intelligence Service
arrested our consul last night.

389
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,683
What? What did he do?

390
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,728
<i> He took bribes from local drug gangs. </i>

391
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,521
That's not a drug. Understand?

392
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,982
And the drug was smuggled into Korea.

393
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,281
No wonder I knew it
because his eyes always look sleepy.

394
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,535
He doesn't take drugs.
He took bribes.

395
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,829
- I see.
Damn it.

396
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,374
This means trouble for us.

397
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,793
Taekwondo kids are coming tomorrow.

398
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,128
I'm sure the leak from inside.

399
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,091
Do you know who the court is?

400
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,344
Why are your eyes looking at me like that?

401
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,971
Why is my eye?
These are my beautiful eyes.

402
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,890
Your eyes are beautiful. I mean ...

403
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,601
In essence, let's be alert.

404
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,854
We are contract workers. Who cares?
See you tomorrow.

405
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,942
What is your business in Portugal?

406
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,283
I see you
secretly call at the office.

407
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,453
Is there something in Portugal?

408
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,956
Maybe a lover?

409
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,501
What's wrong with men?

410
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,922
- What?
- Who wants to cheat on me?

411
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,884
He looks well,
but it turned out to be really crazy.

412
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,470
If only you had weapons,

413
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,557
I'll shoot his head before returning.

414
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,726
Jeez.

415
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,521
I just found out he was violent.

416
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,023
Cheer up, Hae-ri!

417
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,817

419
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,280
You must be tired.

420
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,323
Get enough rest!

00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,325

422
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,387
I just returned from Lisbon.

423
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,851
Yes. Suicide with a gun.

424
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,442

00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,705
Most likely cause of the fall

However, until it gets a report
from the investigation team,

500
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:38,097
I think it's good
we don't take formal positions.
