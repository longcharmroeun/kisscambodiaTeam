1
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:15,824
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,000
<i>Is that the ocean?</i>

3
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,795
It sure is.
What else would it be? A river?

4
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,047
It's Haeundae.

5
00:00:51,632 --> 00:00:53,050
What is "Haeundae"?

6
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,511
What? You've never heard of Haeundae?

7
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:58,096
Is this your first time in Busan?

8
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,976
What have you been doing?
You should've visited sooner.

9
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,231
That's Haeundae over there.
It's very nice.

10
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,025
The Gwangan Bridge, Jagalchi Fish Market…

11
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,902
There are so many awesome places.

12
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:22,788
EXHIBIT HALL 1, HALL 2B

13
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,748
Second floor. Section B is clear.

14
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:54,838
Section D is clear.

15
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:07,351
What's going on?

16
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:50,036
"Thank you for taking the time
to join us."

17
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:53,081
No.

18
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:55,917
"I'd like to thank everyone
for taking the time

19
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,210
to join us."

20
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,597
You startled me.

21
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,309
Seo-jin, I told you
not to do things like this outside.

22
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,144
We're not "outside" right now.

23
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,689
What are your plans after this?

24
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:18,857
Sorry.

25
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,360
I have dinner plans
with the chairman and the investors.

26
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:28,784
Then how about later at night?

27
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,036
At night?

28
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,831
-Stop it.
-Stop what?

29
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:36,875
How do I look?

30
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,003
Let's see.

31
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:42,464
Everything looks great,

32
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,008
except for one thing.

33
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:46,968
-What?
-What do you think?

34
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:50,889
Your tie is crooked.

35
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,227
-There you go.
-All good?

36
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:56,686
Seo-jin.

37
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,356
Tae-sul asked me
if we were seeing each other.

38
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,816
I was taken aback.

39
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,985
Me too. Is he really not coming today?

40
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:06,196
No.

41
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:09,032
You're doing all the hard work,

42
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:11,409
yet he's the CEO of the company.

43
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:12,410
What an easy life.

44
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,039
What can I do?
The company wouldn't exist without him.

45
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:17,833
It's okay, though.

46
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,503
-You're giving the keynote speech.
-That's right.

47
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:30,053
-We'll begin in three minutes.
-Okay.

48
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,140
Shall we?

49
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,225
Let's go.

50
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:40,897
We'll begin in three minutes.
Be on standby.

51
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,748
I'd like to thank everyone
for taking the time to join us.

52
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:55,430
I'm Edward Kim,
the vice president of Quantum & Time.

53
00:07:56,181 --> 00:08:00,435
CEO Han Tae-sul, who was supposed to give
the keynote speech today,

54
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:04,689
is at home trying to recover
from the plane crash.

55
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:07,651
So I will deliver
the keynote speech instead.

56
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,242
Writer William Gibson once said,

57
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:18,370
"The future is already here.

58
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:22,874
It's just not evenly distributed yet."

59
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,834
Ladies and gentlemen.

60
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,587
Meet the new future

61
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:32,592
Quantum & Time
would like to present to you today.

62
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:52,904
Isn't that Han Tae-sul?

63
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:54,948
-Gosh, it's Han Tae-sul!
-It's Han Tae-sul!

64
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:56,616
It's Han Tae-sul!

65
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:03,540
Hello.

66
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:18,513
Please welcome
Han Tae-sul of Quantum & Time!

67
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,280
-Do you want to die?
-What?

68
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:39,117
-You've been receiving death threats.
-I know. I'm the one receiving them.

69
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,203
-Leave the stage at once.
-Seung-bok.

70
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:44,039
I'm not going to die today.

71
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:02,932
My voice sounds nice.

72
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,145
First off, I'd like to apologize.

73
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:10,482
I was a bit late
because I took the train here.

74
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,777
I'm still scared of flying.

75
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,872
"The future."

76
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:26,790
You see,

77
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:31,169
the future is indeed already here
right in front of us.

78
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:34,380
To be more precise, it's in my lab.

79
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:36,091
I'm not letting it get out just yet

80
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:40,428
because we're still in the process
of applying for patent rights.

81
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:05,745
What the heck?

82
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,249
Hey, pay your fare! You crazy woman.

83
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,088
Excuse me!

84
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,340
Wait!

85
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,218
-Identify yourself.
-Move.

86
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,846
Hey! Get her!

87
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,141
-Stop her!
-<i>What I'd like to show you today is…</i>

88
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:28,351
It's…

89
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:31,146
It's…

90
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:35,608
this.

91
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:43,032
I guess you're disappointed.
I can hear our stock price plummeting.

92
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:51,958
Weight, 2.73g. Density, 0.468g/cm.

93
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:56,421
Height and width, 18mm. It's a sugar cube.

94
00:11:56,504 --> 00:12:01,551
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the future of Quantum & Time.

95
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:05,221
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

96
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:10,310
I'm not saying Quantum & Time will open
a sugar refinery out of the blue.

97
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:14,147
They say that
any extremely advanced technology

98
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,358
is indistinguishable from magic.

99
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:21,946
So keep your eyes wide open from now.
Don't even blink.

100
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:07,617
Ladies and gentlemen.

101
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:11,287
Let us reveal our magic.

102
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,751
For the first time
in the history of mankind,

103
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:02,547
we succeeded in teleporting
a polymer compound

104
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:06,843
via quantum teleportation.

105
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:36,414
I didn't have breakfast,
so I needed a little pick-me-up.

106
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:46,716
All right. So what does this mean?

107
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:58,728
-Gosh!
-What happened?

108
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:00,438
Tae-san?

109
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:08,237
What's wrong with him?

110
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:09,614
Get him off the stage now.

111
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,336
Hurry!

112
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:26,297
Tae-san.

113
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:34,389
Tae-san! It's you, right?

114
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:37,058
Han Tae-san!

115
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,398
Han Tae-san!

116
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,694
-Tae-sul, come on.
-Tae-san.

117
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:50,822
-Have you lost your mind?
-Hold on.

118
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:00,832
-Wait, Tae-san!
-Get a grip. Cut it out!

119
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:02,708
I have to go. I must go now.

120
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,462
Han Tae-sul.

121
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:09,632
Han Tae-sul! Get down!

122
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,426
Do you want the company to go bust?

123
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:16,180
-Tae-san!
-Are you crazy?

124
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,474
Let go, you jerk!

125
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:22,145
Han Tae-sul! Get down!

126
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,897
GET DOWN

127
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,192
I said, get down!

128
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,840
Tae-sul!

129
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,720
-Hurry up and go.
-Tae-sul.

130
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:57,972
-Tae-sul!
-We must get out of here! Come on.

131
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,397
-Be quiet.
-Tae-sul!

132
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,485
Tae-sul.

133
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:05,206
Han Tae-sul.

134
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,083
Han Tae-sul, wake up. We need to go.

135
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:10,586
Tae-san!

136
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,095
-What's going on?
-Let's go! Hurry!

137
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,773
An emergency at PEXCO. Requesting backup.

138
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:57,608
Evacuate everyone and move in!

139
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:09,412
-What was that?
-This way.

140
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,548
Police! The police are here!

141
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:23,050
-Police! Over here!
-Hurry up!

142
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,365
Where are we going?

143
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:16,020
Who are you?

144
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:17,772
Shut up.

145
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,523
There's no point in running away.

146
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,400
You know how this is going to end.

147
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:13,077
Get lost.

148
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,794
Get up.

149
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:26,757
Police! Over here!

150
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,885
Drop your gun. Hands up!

151
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:34,598
All right, calm down.

152
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:37,309
Calm down and drop your gun.

153
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,688
Don't follow us.

154
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:59,373
The suspect is armed.
She's on the run with a hostage.

155
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,375
They're stuck
in the emergency exit of the east wing.

156
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,293
Requesting backup.

157
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,421
Go in carefully.

158
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:23,022
-Up there!
-Spread out and go after them!

159
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,374
Get up.

160
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:46,837
Hurry up.

161
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:48,756
This is nuts.

162
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:52,885
This is nuts! Insane!

163
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:05,940
Run.

164
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:21,872
I'm exhausted.

165
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:29,880
I'm dizzy.

166
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:32,383
I'm so dizzy right now.

167
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,593
What the heck?

168
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,980
-What is this?
-Hurry. If you get caught, you'll die.

169
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:47,106
No way. Who are you?

170
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:50,234
-Follow me.
-Okay.

171
00:23:53,654 --> 00:23:54,697
Freeze!

172
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:58,701
It's over. Drop your gun and surrender.

173
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:00,536
They're right.

174
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:03,789
That's enough. Let's surrender.

175
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,085
-No!
-Hey!

176
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:22,307
Hey!

177
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:38,657
Hey, wake up.

178
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:42,036
Damn it. What do I do?

179
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:48,876
He's alive. Thank God.

180
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,634
He looks a little different
from the photo.

181
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:13,317
I thought I'd die.

182
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:17,279
You're bleeding. We must run.

183
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:19,364
The Control Bureau isn't the only one--

184
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:22,409
You almost had us killed! Who are you?

185
00:25:22,993 --> 00:25:26,038
What are you after?
Money? A terror attack?

186
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,207
Who put you up to this? Who sent you?

187
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,251
I saved your life.

188
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,254
I shouldn't have come here.

189
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:36,423
You're…

190
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:41,470
You.

191
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:43,639
You're this one, right?

192
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:45,974
"This one"?

193
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:50,979
What's going on?

194
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,034
Goodness.

195
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:14,002
Mr. Han Tae-sul.

196
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:16,046
What an honor.

197
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:22,553
We spoke a few times on the phone.

198
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:25,055
It's me, Mr. Park.

199
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:28,475
That's right.

200
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:39,444
Youngsters these days
fire bullets whenever they want.

201
00:26:41,321 --> 00:26:44,700
Mr. Han, why don't we talk it out?

202
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:48,620
Sounds good.

203
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:51,373
Let's go.

204
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,793
You said we'd talk it out, jerk!

205
00:26:57,713 --> 00:27:00,632
A violent terror attack took place
in broad daylight.

206
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:03,886
Korea is no longer safe from such attacks.

207
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:05,220
Choi Ji-eun has the story.

208
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:08,849
<i>CEO Han Tae-sul was attacked</i>

209
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:10,517
<i>yesterday at 4 p.m. in PEXCO, Busan,</i>

210
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:13,020
<i>as Quantum & Time
was holding a conference.</i>

211
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:15,856
This shooting incident,
which happens rarely in Korea,

212
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:20,319
has left the nation, which was known
to be free from gun violence, in shock.

213
00:27:20,402 --> 00:27:22,362
The victim, CEO Han Tae-sul,

214
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:24,239
<i>is said to be in critical condition.</i>

215
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:26,366
<i>The suspect,
who's an anti-corporate activist,</i>

216
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,994
<i>was arrested at the scene
immediately after the shooting.</i>

217
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:36,335
We kept the kidnapping top secret
as you requested.

218
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:39,171
But the reporters are snooping around,

219
00:27:39,254 --> 00:27:40,631
so it's only a matter of time.

220
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,343
-Give them money, gift cards, and wine.
-Yes, sir.

221
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:47,137
Have you identified the suspect yet?

222
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:49,640
And the gun? Where is it from?

223
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:52,434
Won't the information
help us find Tae-sul right away?

224
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:54,519
We're looking into it,

225
00:27:54,603 --> 00:27:56,396
but the fingerprints aren't registered.

226
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,106
Neither is the DNA.

227
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,316
Therefore,

228
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:03,362
first, we need to find out if anyone
could be holding a grudge against him.

229
00:28:07,282 --> 00:28:08,951
X-74852 TOP SECRET
CASE FILE NO. 582502

230
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:11,662
Among the e-mails, death threats,
and malicious comments he received,

231
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:14,540
we picked out only the serious cases

232
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,375
and organized them alphabetically.

233
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:20,879
That's a lot.

234
00:28:23,257 --> 00:28:25,717
How many hours has it been
since he got kidnapped?

235
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,804
About 12 hours?

236
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:31,014
Right?

237
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:33,850
It's been about 16 hours.

238
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:35,602
It's been 16 hours--

239
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:38,105
No, it's been 17 and a half hours.

240
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:40,649
Isn't that enough time for him

241
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:43,026
to be dismembered
and buried in multiple locations?

242
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:48,699
Look.

243
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:53,453
Are you looking for a teenage boy
who ran away from home?

244
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:57,791
He's the CEO
of Korea's most valuable company.

245
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:59,793
A business tycoon got shot and kidnapped,

246
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:04,089
and you ask me who could be holding
a grudge against him?

247
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:05,882
Are you kidding me?

248
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:09,303
Do you know how many companies
have gone bankrupt because of him?

249
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:12,347
Do you know how many people
we fired during our M&A?

250
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:14,850
Environmental groups, labor unions,
and lunatics.

251
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:18,520
He received death threats
from dozens of people daily.

252
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:22,524
How could you ask
such an obvious question?

253
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:24,735
Find him.

254
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:26,278
If you can't do it on your own,

255
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,781
get the military's help and find him!

256
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:39,624
DO NOT ENTER
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

257
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:19,664
Why did he miss the target
from such a close distance?

258
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:21,375
Right?

259
00:30:29,424 --> 00:30:31,468
What a headache. I have so much to do.

260
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:34,388
Hurry up and go.

261
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,266
How many fell?

262
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,228
Three or so. One is unconscious.

263
00:30:41,812 --> 00:30:42,938
Clean up the mess.

264
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,815
-Don't forget the witnesses.
-Yes, sir.

265
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:48,652
Where did she and Han Tae-sul go?

266
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:53,407
I'm really sorry. It's all my fault.

267
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,492
I'll find the kidnapper
as soon as possible--

268
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:58,912
You don't need to apologize.
Why is it your fault?

269
00:30:58,995 --> 00:31:00,914
I told the reporters to keep it a secret,

270
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:03,792
and I've already called
all the top police officials.

271
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:08,380
The company has decided

272
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:10,382
not to give in to the kidnapper's demands.

273
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:15,137
-Sir.
-The stock price fell again.

274
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:19,057
Last time, we kept quiet
because you said we should wait,

275
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:21,143
but the situation
has worsened significantly.

276
00:31:23,437 --> 00:31:25,272
Let's vote him out.

277
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,984
But how, when Tae-sul is still missing?

278
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,111
This has to be done if he doesn't return.

279
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:32,529
What if he does?

280
00:31:35,282 --> 00:31:38,744
Tae-sul is like a son to me.

281
00:31:39,286 --> 00:31:41,580
I've known him since he was in university.

282
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:43,331
I feel bad for him too.

283
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:45,625
I want to do whatever it takes
to save him,

284
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:48,044
but as one of the executives…

285
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:50,130
We have 20,000 employees.

286
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:52,883
And what about our subcontractors?

287
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:55,927
If we include their families,
we're talking about 100,000 people.

288
00:31:56,678 --> 00:31:58,138
Given the current situation,

289
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:01,099
it would be better for him to not return.

290
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:05,479
Sir, this company can't exist
without Tae-sul.

291
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:07,355
We have you, Eddy.

292
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:10,734
And you should see this
as an opportunity, not a crisis.

293
00:32:23,705 --> 00:32:28,043
Talk about a live nationwide broadcast
in broad daylight.

294
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,837
Is this where he was last seen?

295
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:34,466
Yes, it looks like he's hiding
with the girl he fled with.

296
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:37,719
If we search the motels in this area,
we might…

297
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:41,515
What's the matter?

298
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:48,897
The brokers.

299
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:49,249
Welcome!

300
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,718
You brat, can't you say hello?

301
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:04,055
Hey, wake up.

302
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,104
Are you awake?

303
00:34:12,147 --> 00:34:13,398
Where are we?

304
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:15,900
I don't know.
I should be asking you that question.

305
00:34:16,526 --> 00:34:17,360
How annoying.

306
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:19,821
I told you to run. This is all your fault.

307
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:23,158
What did you say?
Why are you blaming this on me?

308
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:25,660
Who are you?
You're the girl in that photo, right?

309
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:28,079
What's your name?
Tell me your name at least.

310
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:29,831
Seo-hae.

311
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:32,292
Seo-hae? As in "West Sea"?

312
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,379
What do you want from me?

313
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:39,883
Forget it.

314
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:43,595
Do you see that steel ruler
under your feet?

315
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,556
Extend your leg. I think you can reach it.

316
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:49,768
You can reach it, right?

317
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:53,188
We'll pick it up
and use it to cut this rope.

318
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:55,815
After that… We'll think about that later.

319
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:58,526
We're screwed.
My plan got all ruined because of you.

320
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,654
-Come on!
-What?

321
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:02,030
I told you to hand it over.

322
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:05,617
Hey.

323
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:11,331
I don't understand
why you're so angry right now.

324
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:16,252
It's not like I asked you to save me.

325
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:19,130
I lost sight of my brother because of you.

326
00:35:19,214 --> 00:35:21,132
Tell me everything while we're at it.

327
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,176
Who are you? Are you stalking me?

328
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:25,220
And what's with that wedding photo?

329
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:26,680
Did you photoshop it yourself?

330
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:30,437
Then what? Did we do it?

331
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:34,020
Did we have a one-night stand?

332
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:35,897
Are you crazy?

333
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:37,315
Hey!

334
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:42,570
You're the crazy one. Well done.
I guess we'll die here, then.

335
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,364
We've never met before. Okay?

336
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:46,658
Are you kidding me?

337
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:49,661
You'd better tell me the truth.
Who sent you?

338
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:51,454
Who are you?

339
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:53,832
Me? The person who saved your life.

340
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:57,752
Then save my life now.
What the heck is this?

341
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,796
If you want to live,
shut up and stay still.

342
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:02,215
Hey, if you want to live,
go pick up that ruler.

343
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,259
-Pick up the ruler now.
-Be quiet.

344
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:06,094
You be quiet.

345
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,973
What's going on here? You guys woke up.

346
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:21,317
Let's see.

347
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,669
Goodness, why bring this?

348
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:41,087
What is all this?

349
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:43,339
Why would they risk their lives

350
00:36:43,923 --> 00:36:46,176
to bring this useless junk
all the way here?

351
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:50,430
Don't the brokers there tell them
they don't need these things here?

352
00:36:57,479 --> 00:37:00,231
Goodness, Mr. Han.

353
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:05,236
Did you sleep well?

354
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,698
You look more handsome
with your eyes open.

355
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:11,159
I dressed your wound here.

356
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:12,952
I'll change the gauze for you later.

357
00:37:13,453 --> 00:37:15,288
Cut it out. Don't be such a flirt.

358
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:16,206
What?

359
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,666
Do you have a death wish?

360
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,626
Hey!

361
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,088
Don't fight in front of the guests.

362
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,968
Mr. Han.

363
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:31,179
Come with me.

364
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:44,234
Let's go inside.
Close the door behind you.

365
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:57,205
You guys should eat something.

366
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:03,294
Come on in.

367
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,843
Where is this from?

368
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:16,307
Sit down, both of you.

369
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,483
You fools always forget
to bring the bottle opener.

370
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:43,710
<i>It's been 72 hours since
Quantum & Time CEO Han Tae-sul got shot,</i>

371
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:48,798
<i>but the police haven't even been able
to identify the suspect yet.</i>

372
00:38:48,882 --> 00:38:52,802
<i>Initially, the company stated
that CEO Han was doing fine,</i>

373
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:55,805
-<i>but he hasn't been seen in public,</i>
-See? They're keeping it secret.

374
00:38:55,889 --> 00:39:00,977
-<i>raising speculation that he is in danger.</i>
-The society should be transparent.

375
00:39:02,395 --> 00:39:05,732
<i>CEO Han's bodyguard, Yeo,
who got injured at the scene,</i>

376
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:09,402
<i>is unconscious and in critical condition
at the moment.</i>

377
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:20,622
That was a good meal.

378
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:22,665
Seon-ho!

379
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:26,127
Make me a cup of coffee.

380
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,546
Coffee, anyone? No?

381
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:30,673
Get it right this time.

382
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:34,218
One cream, two sugars.

383
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,139
If you get it wrong again, I'll kill you.

384
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:39,057
Yes, sir.

385
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:46,606
That idiot is so dumb.
He gets it wrong every single time.

386
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:50,109
Wait and see.
He'll put in two creams and one sugar.

387
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:54,614
Anyway, did you guys get some rest?

388
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,494
Right.

389
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:04,165
Now that we've had some food,
let's get down to business.

390
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:08,419
I'm the owner of Asia Mart.

391
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:13,299
But this is only a small part
of my business.

392
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:16,260
Our main focus is…

393
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:19,222
We're like the unofficial embassy.

394
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:24,102
We look after people
who came here from the other side.

395
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:26,938
Mr. Han,

396
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:30,942
the reason I brought you here is--

397
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:32,610
Why are you trying to kill me?

398
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:34,570
Kill you?

399
00:40:35,154 --> 00:40:36,823
No!

400
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:40,243
The folks from the Control Bureau
tried to kill you.

401
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:43,246
As you can see,
I brought you here safe and sound.

402
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:45,498
I even got your injuries treated.

403
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:50,128
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd already be dead.

404
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,797
The Control Bureau? What do they control?

405
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:55,550
Where's the key? Did you bring it?

406
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,176
What happened to my brother?

407
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,845
Why are you asking me?

408
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,763
That key is mine!

409
00:41:00,847 --> 00:41:03,141
-No, it's mine.
-You little…

410
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:05,727
What is the Control Bureau?
And what kind of "embassy"?

411
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,854
What happened to my brother?
And the suitcase?

412
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:10,523
Tae-san fell from the sky.
What is going on?

413
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:11,607
Why?

414
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:14,902
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

415
00:41:16,237 --> 00:41:18,573
It'd be better for you to remain unaware.

416
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:26,247
Fine.

417
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,626
Then let me ask you one last thing.

418
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:33,379
Think carefully before you answer.

419
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:39,385
Okay, Mr. Han.

420
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:44,140
Let's say there's something
you regret doing in the past,

421
00:41:44,223 --> 00:41:46,809
and you want to change it.

422
00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:50,605
How much would you be willing
to pay for it?

423
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,983
Everything I've got.

424
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:56,444
"Everything"?

425
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:00,490
All of it?

426
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:02,617
I see.

427
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:08,289
I understand what you mean.

428
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:14,921
I'll just take this.

429
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:17,340
-Did you get it right this time?
-Yes.

430
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:18,633
All right.

431
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:28,768
See? He got it wrong again.

432
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:32,438
Even though I know
he'd get it wrong every single time,

433
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:35,149
I can't help it.

434
00:42:37,568 --> 00:42:39,070
You see, the future is…

435
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:42,115
It's a mirror of the present
and can't be changed.

436
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:44,492
That's right.

437
00:42:48,037 --> 00:42:49,205
If I tell you,

438
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,374
give me the key.

439
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:53,042
Okay.

440
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,044
All right.

441
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,005
Seeing is believing, so let me show you.

442
00:42:58,756 --> 00:42:59,590
Guys.

443
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,347
Show Mr. Han what we exactly do.

444
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:21,112
Are you really taking them along?
You've never let me go with you.

445
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:23,364
It's nothing nice.

446
00:43:23,448 --> 00:43:25,491
Fine, if that's what our boss wants.

447
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:30,746
-Is anyone coming?
-Let's see.

448
00:43:42,884 --> 00:43:43,718
No.

449
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,803
Let me check another server.

450
00:43:57,815 --> 00:43:58,816
That's the downloader.

451
00:44:00,443 --> 00:44:02,028
What is she downloading?

452
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,450
Hold up your hands.

453
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:12,622
Put this on.

454
00:44:13,456 --> 00:44:14,540
Your hands.

455
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:22,215
You put this on too.

456
00:44:23,132 --> 00:44:24,592
-Why?
-Why ask?

457
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:25,843
Don't do it, then.

458
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,649
Why is he aiming the rifle at us?

459
00:44:40,274 --> 00:44:41,317
Is he a robot?

460
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:48,824
Hey, what do you mean
by "from the other side"?

461
00:44:48,908 --> 00:44:50,368
Where are you from?

462
00:44:50,451 --> 00:44:51,786
That's not important.

463
00:44:52,745 --> 00:44:53,579
Then what is?

464
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,123
The important thing is…

465
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,086
I spotted one.

466
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:03,422
The temp agencies.

467
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:06,175
I hate that place.

468
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:08,511
Why do they keep sending them there?

469
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:10,930
It's the best place to disguise yourself.

470
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:14,725
Let's go. Turn around.

471
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:22,441
Take this.

472
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:24,902
For motion sickness. Don't puke.

473
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,222
Hey, you.

474
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:55,891
You're from the other side, aren't you?

475
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:01,939
You should've reported your arrival
as soon as you got here

476
00:46:02,023 --> 00:46:05,818
and handed over your belongings.
Why did you run away?

477
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:08,154
Didn't you get any instructions
on your way here?

478
00:46:08,863 --> 00:46:10,364
Nope.

479
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:11,282
"Nope"?

480
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:16,078
Why are the youngsters these days so rude?

481
00:46:16,162 --> 00:46:18,205
-What's your name?
-Seo-hae.

482
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:20,041
-And your last name?
-I don't have one.

483
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:24,670
What about your parents?

484
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:26,797
I don't have any.

485
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:29,508
Come on.
No one is born without their parents.

486
00:46:29,592 --> 00:46:33,721
What a rude brat.
Fine. Who do you know here?

487
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:35,681
No one.

488
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:36,807
No one?

489
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,976
-Not even one?
-Nope.

490
00:46:40,603 --> 00:46:42,563
Okay. Then why did you come here?

491
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:44,648
Sightseeing.

492
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:47,818
Sightseeing? That's nice.

493
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:50,488
Got a death wish?

494
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:52,156
You little…

495
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:59,872
By the way, if you took the downloader,

496
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:02,041
you--

497
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:10,174
You need to pay.

498
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:12,468
There's no such thing as a free ride.

499
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:14,345
If you don't pay…

500
00:47:17,473 --> 00:47:18,307
Hold on.

501
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,561
Look at this.

502
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:26,315
What's all this?

503
00:47:29,902 --> 00:47:33,823
What are these for?
Are you going to war or something?

504
00:47:35,324 --> 00:47:38,244
Ridiculous. How cute.

505
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:42,206
What's this?

506
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:45,709
What is this? A diary or a planner?

507
00:47:45,793 --> 00:47:47,711
Give it back, or I'll kill you.

508
00:47:47,795 --> 00:47:49,380
Damn you.

509
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,641
"Dear Seo-hae,

510
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:03,811
Happy birthday. By the time--"

511
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:15,739
FOOD, CURRENCY EXCHANGE,
JOB PLACEMENT, INQUIRIES WELCOME

512
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:18,826
You little…

513
00:48:19,535 --> 00:48:21,245
What's wrong with you?

514
00:48:21,328 --> 00:48:23,080
Sit down. Back to your seat!

515
00:48:23,164 --> 00:48:24,248
Hold on.

516
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,711
Hey, calm down.

517
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:31,881
That thing's huge.
If you fire it, everyone here will die!

518
00:48:31,964 --> 00:48:33,549
Calm down, please.

519
00:48:33,632 --> 00:48:35,676
This isn't the US.

520
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:39,180
Can we not resolve conflict without guns?

521
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:41,390
I'm so not used to this.

522
00:48:42,224 --> 00:48:44,810
You let go of him first and sit down.

523
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:48,856
And you, put your gun down.
Enough already.

524
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:50,524
Good. We want peace.

525
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:52,485
We're good now.

526
00:48:55,488 --> 00:48:58,157
Why on earth did you read her diary?

527
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,826
Hey, this is mine.

528
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,871
Guys, kill them.

529
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,291
Let's get this straight.

530
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:08,959
Why is it yours?

531
00:49:09,585 --> 00:49:11,837
Because everything she brought is mine.

532
00:49:13,172 --> 00:49:14,757
What a nasty jerk.

533
00:49:16,258 --> 00:49:18,093
I'll buy that diary.

534
00:49:18,177 --> 00:49:19,595
Are we good now? I'll buy it.

535
00:49:20,596 --> 00:49:22,598
-For how much?
-How much is it?

536
00:49:24,892 --> 00:49:26,477
It's expensive.

537
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,063
Come on. I'm rich. How much do you want?

538
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:32,733
A hundred million won?

539
00:49:34,443 --> 00:49:35,903
Her diary costs 100 million won?

540
00:49:40,074 --> 00:49:41,575
Where's my phone?

541
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:42,910
Hand it over.

542
00:49:44,286 --> 00:49:46,664
Come on, Mr. Han.

543
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:50,543
If you turn on your phone,

544
00:49:50,626 --> 00:49:54,380
it would be like announcing
you're held captive here.

545
00:49:54,463 --> 00:49:57,675
Will you call your family,
ask them how they're doing,

546
00:49:57,758 --> 00:50:00,844
call the cops and make a report?
Is that your plan?

547
00:50:00,928 --> 00:50:01,929
No.

548
00:50:02,012 --> 00:50:04,765
The GPS tracker on my phone
is always turned off

549
00:50:04,848 --> 00:50:08,519
because my friend, Seung-bok,
always stalks me.

550
00:50:08,602 --> 00:50:09,562
I'm serious.

551
00:50:09,645 --> 00:50:11,689
It will only take ten seconds,
so turn it on and see.

552
00:50:12,273 --> 00:50:13,148
Seung-bok?

553
00:50:15,317 --> 00:50:16,277
Give me his phone.

554
00:50:19,572 --> 00:50:21,532
If the GPS is on,

555
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,993
you're dead meat.

556
00:50:33,502 --> 00:50:34,336
It's true.

557
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:38,507
Here.

558
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,721
See this bank account number?

559
00:50:43,804 --> 00:50:46,890
Send 150 million won here.

560
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,102
Wait, you said 100 million.

561
00:50:52,104 --> 00:50:54,023
There's a fee for using the account.

562
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:56,358
What's the matter?

563
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:59,445
Are you reluctant to send it
because it's too much?

564
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:04,992
"A fee for using the account"?

565
00:51:05,576 --> 00:51:07,870
I've never heard of such a fee.

566
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:11,165
Fine, 150 million won.

567
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:18,922
Look, 150 million won.
We're good now, right?

568
00:51:23,385 --> 00:51:24,887
Impressive.

569
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:30,809
This is why the ladies love you.

570
00:51:33,646 --> 00:51:34,813
Just hand over the diary.

571
00:51:34,897 --> 00:51:36,398
All right.

572
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:38,275
Goodness.

573
00:51:51,664 --> 00:51:52,998
I never asked for your help.

574
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:55,626
You said you saved my life.
We're even now.

575
00:51:59,296 --> 00:52:01,423
-Do you have the key?
-Why do you ask?

576
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:04,802
That scumbag will kill you
the moment you give him the key.

577
00:52:06,762 --> 00:52:07,721
I know.

578
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:11,725
You guys are so chatty.

579
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:14,978
We're here.

580
00:52:44,007 --> 00:52:47,428
-Two plasterers!
-Over here!

581
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,930
Come here! You too.

582
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:52,433
-Your ID and safety certificate.
-ID and certificate?

583
00:52:52,516 --> 00:52:55,227
-Here you go.
-Get in the car! Your ID and certificate.

584
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:58,230
-I brought them with me.
-Just get in the car.

585
00:52:58,313 --> 00:53:03,569
GWANGSEONG MANUFACTURING
SEONGMUN STAFFING SERVICES

586
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:10,075
Those illegal immigrants
should get deported!

587
00:53:12,828 --> 00:53:15,497
-Hey, you.
-What did you just say?

588
00:53:15,581 --> 00:53:19,918
Hey! Go back to your country,
you cockroaches!

589
00:53:21,128 --> 00:53:21,962
-What?
-You rat!

590
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:23,213
What did you say?

591
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:26,341
-You punched me first!
-We can't get jobs because of you punks!

592
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:28,886
-Damn you.
-Hey!

593
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:32,139
-We're in this mess because of you!
-You jerk!

594
00:53:33,223 --> 00:53:36,143
-What's your problem?
-You scumbag, let go!

595
00:53:36,226 --> 00:53:39,521
The Control Bureau! They're here!

596
00:53:45,027 --> 00:53:47,488
-My gosh!
-The Control Bureau is here.

597
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,115
They're here. Run!

598
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:52,868
-Let's go.
-Just run!

599
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:54,870
-Are they here?
-Go. Hurry!

600
00:53:54,953 --> 00:53:58,832
-They're here!
-We're here for an inspection. Don't move.

601
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:01,752
Don't move!

602
00:54:12,137 --> 00:54:13,430
Is this a crackdown or a ruse?

603
00:54:13,514 --> 00:54:14,681
Back off.

604
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:17,976
Arrest all those illegal immigrants!
Those scumbags…

605
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,770
Why are you scanning us?

606
00:54:19,853 --> 00:54:22,648
We're all Korean! Arrest them!

607
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:46,129
-Get them!
-Catch them!

608
00:55:01,395 --> 00:55:02,229
You punk.

609
00:55:04,147 --> 00:55:05,816
-Let me go!
-Come here.

610
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:07,484
Come here.

611
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:09,403
Let go of me!

612
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,370
Those jerks from the Control Bureau…

613
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:20,706
Look at them
trying to suppress and control

614
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:23,750
the small business owners
who work hard to make ends meet.

615
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:27,379
Then who's responsible
for this country's economy?

616
00:55:28,297 --> 00:55:29,840
What a mess.

617
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:37,472
Hello, Bingbing.
The Control Bureau is here.

618
00:55:37,556 --> 00:55:39,683
Can you take a look and locate them?

619
00:55:41,727 --> 00:55:42,978
I got one, just now.

620
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:51,028
-I sent you the coordinates.
-All right.

621
00:55:58,076 --> 00:56:00,412
Mr. Han, let's do some work.

622
00:56:02,664 --> 00:56:03,498
Everyone.

623
00:56:03,582 --> 00:56:08,170
It's now time for you to witness
the secret of this hidden world.

624
00:56:10,005 --> 00:56:11,298
Let's go.

625
00:56:35,197 --> 00:56:36,031
This is the spot.

626
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,340
What are we waiting for?

627
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:56,426
-A person.
-Who?

628
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:01,890
Do you contribute to the National Pension?

629
00:57:02,724 --> 00:57:05,560
I paid 400,000 won this month.

630
00:57:05,644 --> 00:57:07,729
They're thieves. Total swindlers.

631
00:57:07,813 --> 00:57:10,816
We all know that
the pension money will run out by 2040,

632
00:57:10,899 --> 00:57:13,443
but they keep collecting contributions.

633
00:57:13,527 --> 00:57:15,445
Why do you think this is happening?

634
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,115
Weird, right?

635
00:57:21,785 --> 00:57:24,496
But if you think about it,
even weirder things happen.

636
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,207
Have you ever experienced
anything like that?

637
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:28,750
Such as

638
00:57:30,168 --> 00:57:32,796
seeing a photo of you
that you don't remember taking

639
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,801
or seeing a photo of something
that hasn't happened yet, for example.

640
00:57:42,404 --> 00:57:43,905
<i>When is this?</i>

641
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,371
This is crazy.

642
00:57:46,852 --> 00:57:48,228
The conference in two days.

643
00:57:51,142 --> 00:57:53,018
Why? You've experienced it?

644
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,914
I guess you have!

645
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:01,215
That's it, Mr. Han!

646
00:58:02,242 --> 00:58:04,453
You're smart, so think about it.

647
00:58:05,245 --> 00:58:08,540
How can something like that happen?

648
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:11,918
Mr. Han, the important thing

649
00:58:12,002 --> 00:58:14,379
isn't where they come from.

650
00:58:14,463 --> 00:58:15,881
That's not important.

651
00:58:16,465 --> 00:58:17,674
Then what is?

652
00:58:18,675 --> 00:58:19,926
The important thing is…

653
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:23,305
What matters is

654
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:25,891
"when."

655
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,151
He's here.

656
00:59:29,246 --> 00:59:30,956
Have you heard of this quote?

657
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:36,711
"The future is already here.

658
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:42,426
It's just not evenly distributed yet."

659
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,261
Cool, right?

660
01:00:04,531 --> 01:00:07,659
Welcome to the future.

661
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,580
the future.

662
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,086
<i>You want to know why they come here?</i>

663
01:01:01,504 --> 01:01:02,589
<i>It's because of regret.</i>

664
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:06,259
<i>Even when they know
they can't change anything,</i>

665
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,638
<i>they think,
"Why didn't I do that back then?"</i>

666
01:01:10,597 --> 01:01:12,724
<i>The thought torments them every night.</i>

667
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,855
I know where your brother is.

668
01:01:18,939 --> 01:01:20,982
-What?
-Han Tae-san.

669
01:01:25,278 --> 01:01:26,363
<i>Did you find him?</i>

670
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:34,829
-<i>They got away.</i>
-Find them, then!

671
01:01:36,261 --> 01:01:38,096
Keep tracking Han Tae-sul's phone.

672
01:01:38,163 --> 01:01:39,873
And hijack every signal that it transmits.

673
01:01:40,052 --> 01:01:42,962
It's good to see you again, Mr. Han.

674
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:45,590
Go! Hurry!

675
01:01:47,467 --> 01:01:50,428
