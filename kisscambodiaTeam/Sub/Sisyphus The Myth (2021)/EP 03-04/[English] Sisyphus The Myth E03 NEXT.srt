1
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:02,103
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>Is that the ocean?</i>

3
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,595
It sure is.
What else would it be? A river?

4
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,846
It's Haeundae.

5
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,849
What is "Haeundae"?

6
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,310
What? You've never heard of Haeundae?

7
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,896
Is this your first time in Busan?

8
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,776
What have you been doing?
You should've visited sooner.

9
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,030
That's Haeundae over there.
It's very nice.

10
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,825
The Gwangan Bridge, Jagalchi Fish Market…

11
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,701
There are so many awesome places.

12
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,587
EXHIBIT HALL 1, HALL 2B

13
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,548
Second floor. Section B is clear.

14
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,638
Section D is clear.

15
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,150
What's going on?

16
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:23,503
SISYPHUS

17
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,836
"Thank you for taking the time
to join us."

18
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,881
No.

19
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,717
"I'd like to thank everyone
for taking the time

20
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,010
to join us."

21
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,396
You startled me.

22
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,108
Seo-jin, I told you
not to do things like this outside.

23
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,943
We're not "outside" right now.

24
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,489
What are your plans after this?

25
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,656
Sorry.

26
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,160
I have dinner plans
with the chairman and the investors.

27
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,583
Then how about later at night?

28
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,835
At night?

29
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,631
-Stop it.
-Stop what?

30
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,674
How do I look?

31
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,803
Let's see.

32
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,263
Everything looks great,

33
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,808
except for one thing.

34
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,768
-What?
-What do you think?

35
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,688
Your tie is crooked.

36
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,026
-There you go.
-All good?

37
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,486
Seo-jin.

38
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,155
Tae-sul asked me
if we were seeing each other.

39
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,615
I was taken aback.

40
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,785
Me too. Is he really not coming today?

41
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,995
No.

42
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,832
You're doing all the hard work,

43
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,209
yet he's the CEO of the company.

44
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,210
What an easy life.

45
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,839
What can I do?
The company wouldn't exist without him.

46
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,632
It's okay, though.

47
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,302
-You're giving the keynote speech.
-That's right.

48
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,853
-We'll begin in three minutes.
-Okay.

49
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,939
Shall we?

50
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,024
Let's go.

51
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,697
We'll begin in three minutes.
Be on standby.

52
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,547
I'd like to thank everyone
for taking the time to join us.

53
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,230
I'm Edward Kim,
the vice president of Quantum & Time.

54
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,235
CEO Han Tae-sul, who was supposed to give
the keynote speech today,

55
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,489
is at home trying to recover
from the plane crash.

56
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,450
So I will deliver
the keynote speech instead.

57
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,042
Writer William Gibson once said,

58
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,169
"The future is already here.

59
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,674
It's just not evenly distributed yet."

60
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,634
Ladies and gentlemen.

61
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,387
Meet the new future

62
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,392
Quantum & Time
would like to present to you today.

63
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,704
Isn't that Han Tae-sul?

64
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,747
-Gosh, it's Han Tae-sul!
-It's Han Tae-sul!

65
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,416
It's Han Tae-sul!

66
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,339
Hello.

67
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,313
Please welcome
Han Tae-sul of Quantum & Time!

68
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,079
-Do you want to die?
-What?

69
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,916
-You've been receiving death threats.
-I know. I'm the one receiving them.

70
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,003
-Leave the stage at once.
-Seung-bok.

71
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,838
I'm not going to die today.

72
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,732
Testing. My voice sounds nice.

73
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,944
First off, I'd like to apologize.

74
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,281
I was a bit late
because I took the train here.

75
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,576
I'm still scared of flying.

76
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,672
"The future."

77
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,589
You see,

78
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,968
the future is indeed already here
right in front of us.

79
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,180
To be more precise, it's in my lab.

80
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,890
I'm not letting it get out just yet

81
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:27,228
because we're still in the process
of applying for patent rights.

82
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,545
What the heck?

83
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,048
Hey, pay your fare! You crazy woman.

84
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,887
Excuse me!

85
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,140
Wait!

86
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,017
-Identify yourself.
-Move.

87
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,645
Hey! Get her!

88
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,940
-Stop her!
-<i>What I'd like to show you today is…</i>

89
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,151
It's…

90
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,945
It's…

91
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,408
this.

92
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,832
I guess you're disappointed.
I can hear our stock price plummeting.

93
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,757
Weight, 2,73g. Density, 0,468g/cm.

94
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:43,220
Height and width, 18mm. It's a sugar cube.

95
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:48,350
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the future of Quantum & Time.

96
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,021
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

97
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:57,109
I'm not saying Quantum & Time will open
a sugar refinery out of the blue.

98
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,946
They say that
any extremely advanced technology

99
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,158
is indistinguishable from magic.

100
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:08,746
So keep your eyes wide open from now.
Don't even blink.

101
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,416
Ladies and gentlemen.

102
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,087
Let us reveal our magic.

103
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
For the first time
in the history of mankind,

104
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:49,346
we succeeded in teleporting
a polymer compound

105
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,642
via quantum teleportation.

106
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,213
I didn't have breakfast,
so I needed a little pick-me-up.

107
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,515
All right. So what does this mean?

108
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,527
-Gosh!
-What happened?

109
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,237
Tae-san?

110
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,037
What's wrong with him?

111
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,413
Get him off the stage now.

112
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,135
Hurry!

113
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,097
Tae-san.

114
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,188
Tae-san! It's you, right?

115
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,857
Han Tae-san!

116
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,197
Han Tae-san!

117
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,494
-Tae-sul, come on.
-Tae-san.

118
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,621
-Have you lost your mind?
-Hold on.

119
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,631
-Wait, Tae-san!
-Get a grip. Cut it out!

120
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,508
I have to go. I must go now.

121
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,262
Han Tae-sul.

122
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,432
Han Tae-sul! Get down!

123
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,225
Do you want the company to go bust?

124
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,980
-Tae-san!
-Are you crazy?

125
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,274
Let go, you jerk!

126
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,944
Han Tae-sul! Get down!

127
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,697
GET DOWN

128
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,992
I said, get down!

129
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,639
Tae-sul!

130
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,519
-Hurry up and go.
-Tae-sul.

131
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,772
-Tae-sul!
-We must get out of here! Come on.

132
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,197
-Be quiet.
-Tae-sul!

133
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,284
Tae-sul.

134
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,005
Han Tae-sul.

135
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,882
Han Tae-sul, wake up. We need to go.

136
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,386
Tae-san!

137
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,894
-What's going on?
-Let's go! Hurry!

138
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,472
An emergency at PEXCO. Requesting backup.

139
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,308
Evacuate everyone and move in!

140
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,111
-What was that?
-This way.

141
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,247
Police! The police are here!

142
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,750
-Police! Over here!
-Hurry up!

143
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,065
Where are we going?

144
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,719
Who are you?

145
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,471
Shut up.

146
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,222
There's no point in running away.

147
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,100
You know how this is going to end.

148
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,776
Get lost.

149
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,493
Get up.

150
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,457
Police! Over here!

151
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,585
Drop your gun. Hands up!

152
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,298
All right, calm down.

153
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,009
Calm down and drop your gun.

154
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,387
Don't follow us.

155
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,073
The suspect is armed.
She's on the run with a hostage.

156
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,075
They're stuck
in the emergency exit of the east wing.

157
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:48,992
Requesting backup.

158
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,120
Go in carefully.

159
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,721
-Up there!
-Spread out and go after them!

160
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,074
Get up.

161
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,537
Hurry up.

162
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,455
This is nuts.

163
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,584
This is nuts! Insane!

164
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,639
Run.

165
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,572
I'm exhausted.

166
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,580
I'm dizzy.

167
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,082
I'm so dizzy right now.

168
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,293
What the heck?

169
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,679
-What is this?
-Hurry. If you get caught, you'll die.

170
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,805
No way. Who are you?

171
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,933
-Follow me.
-Okay.

172
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,396
Freeze!

173
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,400
It's over. Drop your gun and surrender.

174
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,235
They're right.

175
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,488
That's enough. Let's surrender.

176
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,784
-No!
-Hey!

177
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,007
Hey!

178
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,357
Hey, wake up.

179
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,735
Damn it. What do I do?

180
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,575
He's alive. Thank God.

181
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,334
He looks a little different
from the photo.

182
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,016
I thought I'd die.

183
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,979
You're bleeding. We must run.

184
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,064
The Control Bureau isn't the only one--

185
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,109
You almost had us killed! Who are you?

186
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,737
What are you after?
Money? A terror attack?

187
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,906
Who put you up to this? Who sent you?

188
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,951
I saved your life.

189
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,954
I shouldn't have come here.

190
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,123
You're…

191
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,169
You.

192
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,338
You're this one, right?

193
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,674
"This one"?

194
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,679
What's going on?

195
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,734
Goodness.

196
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,702
Mr. Han Tae-sul.

197
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,746
What an honor.

198
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,252
We spoke a few times on the phone.

199
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,755
It's me, Mr. Park.

200
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,175
That's right.

201
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:26,144
Youngsters these days
fire bullets whenever they want.

202
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,399
Mr. Han, why don't we talk it out?

203
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,320
Sounds good.

204
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,073
Let's go.

205
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,493
You said we'd talk it out, jerk!

206
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,332
A violent terror attack took place
in broad daylight.

207
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,585
Korea is no longer safe from such attacks.

208
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,920
Choi Ji-eun has the story.

209
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,548
<i>CEO Han Tae-sul was attacked</i>

210
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,217
<i>yesterday at 4 p.m. in PEXCO, Busan,</i>

211
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,719
<i>as Quantum & Time
was holding a conference.</i>

212
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,555
This shooting incident,
which happens rarely in Korea,

213
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:07,018
has left the nation, which was known
to be free from gun violence, in shock.

214
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,062
The victim, CEO Han Tae-sul,

215
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,939
<i>is said to be in critical condition.</i>

216
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,066
<i>The suspect,
who's an anti-corporate activist,</i>

217
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,693
<i>was arrested at the scene
immediately after the shooting.</i>

218
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,034
We kept the kidnapping top secret
as you requested.

219
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,870
But the reporters are snooping around,

220
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,330
so it's only a matter of time.

221
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,042
-Give them money, gift cards, and wine.
-Yes, sir.

222
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,837
Have you identified the suspect yet?

223
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,339
And the gun? Where is it from?

224
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,134
Won't the information
help us find Tae-sul right away?

225
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,219
We're looking into it,

226
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,096
but the fingerprints aren't registered.

227
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,806
Neither is the DNA.

228
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,015
Therefore,

229
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,061
first, we need to find out if anyone
could be holding a grudge against him.

230
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,650
X-74852 TOP SECRET
CASE FILE NO. 582502

231
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,361
Among the e-mails, death threats,
and malicious comments he received,

232
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,239
we picked out only the serious cases

233
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,074
and organized them alphabetically.

234
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,579
That's a lot.

235
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,417
How many hours has it been
since he got kidnapped?

236
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,503
About 12 hours?

237
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,714
Right?

238
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,550
It's been about 16 hours.

239
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,302
It's been 16 hours--

240
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,804
No, it's been 17 and a half hours.

241
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,348
Isn't that enough time for him

242
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,726
to be dismembered
and buried in multiple locations?

243
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,398
Look.

244
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,153
Are you looking for a teenage boy
who ran away from home?

245
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,491
He's the CEO
of Korea's most valuable company.

246
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,493
A business tycoon got shot and kidnapped,

247
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,789
and you ask me who could be holding
a grudge against him?

248
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,582
Are you kidding me?

249
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:56,002
Do you know how many companies
have gone bankrupt because of him?

250
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,047
Do you know how many people
we fired during our M&A?

251
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,549
Environmental groups, labor unions,
and lunatics.

252
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,220
He received death threats
from dozens of people daily.

253
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,224
How could you ask
such an obvious question?

254
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,434
Find him.

255
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,977
If you can't do it on your own,

256
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,481
get the military's help and find him!

257
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,324
DO NOT ENTER
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

258
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,364
Why did he miss the target
from such a close distance?

259
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,074
Right?

260
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,167
What a headache. I have so much to do.

261
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,087
Hurry up and go.

262
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:24,966
How many fell?

263
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,927
Three or so. One is unconscious.

264
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,637
Clean up the mess.

265
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,514
-Don't forget the witnesses.
-Yes, sir.

266
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,351
Where did she and Han Tae-sul go?

267
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,106
I'm really sorry. It's all my fault.

268
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,191
I'll find the kidnapper
as soon as possible--

269
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,612
You don't need to apologize.
Why is it your fault?

270
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,614
I told the reporters to keep it a secret,

271
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,491
and I've already called
all the top police officials.

272
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,079
The company has decided

273
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,081
not to give in to the kidnapper's demands.

274
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,836
-Sir.
-The stock price fell again.

275
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,757
Last time, we kept quiet
because you said we should wait,

276
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,842
but the situation
has worsened significantly.

277
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,971
Let's vote him out.

278
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,683
But how, when Tae-sul is still missing?

279
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,810
This has to be done if he doesn't return.

280
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,228
What if he does?

281
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:25,443
Tae-sul is like a son to me.

282
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,279
I've known him since he was in university.

283
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,031
I feel bad for him too.

284
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,325
I want to do whatever it takes
to save him,

285
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,744
but as one of the executives…

286
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,829
We have 20,000 employees.

287
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,582
And what about our subcontractors?

288
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,627
If we include their families,
we're talking about 100,000 people.

289
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,837
Given the current situation,

290
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,799
it would be better for him to not return.

291
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:52,178
Sir, this company can't exist
without Tae-sul.

292
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,055
We have you, Eddy.

293
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,433
And you should see this
as an opportunity, not a crisis.

294
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,742
Talk about a live nationwide broadcast
in broad daylight.

295
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,537
Is this where he was last seen?

296
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,165
Yes, it looks like he's hiding
with the girl he fled with.

297
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,419
If we search the motels in this area,
we might…

298
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,214
What's the matter?

299
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,596
The brokers.

300
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,948
Welcome!

301
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,417
You brat, can't you say hello?

302
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,755
Hey, wake up.

303
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,804
Are you awake?

304
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,098
Where are we?

305
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,600
I don't know.
I should be asking you that question.

306
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,060
How annoying.

307
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,521
I told you to run. This is all your fault.

308
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,857
What did you say?
Why are you blaming this on me?

309
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,360
Who are you?
You're the girl in that photo, right?

310
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,779
What's your name?
Tell me your name at least.

311
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,531
Seo-hae.

312
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,991
Seo-hae? As in "West Sea"?

313
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,079
What do you want from me?

314
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,582
Forget it.

315
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,294
Do you see that steel ruler
under your feet?

316
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,256
Extend your leg. I think you can reach it.

317
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,467
You can reach it, right?

318
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,887
We'll pick it up
and use it to cut this rope.

319
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,515
After that… We'll think about that later.

320
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,226
We're screwed.
My plan got all ruined because of you.

321
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,353
-Come on!
-What?

322
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,729
I told you to hand it over.

323
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,316
Hey.

324
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:58,030
I don't understand
why you're so angry right now.

325
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,952
It's not like I asked you to save me.

326
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,830
I lost sight of my brother because of you.

327
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,832
Tell me everything while we're at it.

328
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,876
Who are you? Are you stalking me?

329
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,919
And what's with that wedding photo?

330
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,379
Did you photoshop it yourself?

331
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,216
Then what? Did we do it?

332
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,720
Did we have a one-night stand?

333
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,597
Are you crazy?

334
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,015
Hey!

335
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,270
You're the crazy one. Well done.
I guess we'll die here, then.

336
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,063
We've never met before. Okay?

337
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,357
Are you kidding me?

338
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,360
You'd better tell me the truth.
Who sent you?

339
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,154
Who are you?

340
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,531
Me? The person who saved your life.

341
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,452
Then save my life now.
What the heck is this?

342
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,495
If you want to live,
shut up and stay still.

343
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,915
Hey, if you want to live,
go pick up that ruler.

344
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,958
-Pick up the ruler now.
-Be quiet.

345
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,793
You be quiet.

346
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,672
What's going on here? You guys woke up.

347
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,017
Let's see.

348
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,369
Goodness, why bring this?

349
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,787
What is all this?

350
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,039
Why would they risk their lives

351
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,875
to bring this useless junk
all the way here?

352
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,129
Don't the brokers there tell them
they don't need these things here?

353
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,931
Goodness, Mr. Han.

354
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,936
Did you sleep well?

355
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,398
You look more handsome
with your eyes open.

356
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,858
I dressed your wound here.

357
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,652
I'll change the gauze for you later.

358
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,988
Cut it out. Don't be such a flirt.

359
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,905
What?

360
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,366
Do you have a death wish?

361
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,325
Hey!

362
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,788
Don't fight in front of the guests.

363
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,668
Mr. Han.

364
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,878
Come with me.

365
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,933
Let's go inside.
Close the door behind you.

366
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,904
You guys should eat something.

367
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,994
Come on in.

368
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,542
Where is this from?

369
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,007
Sit down, both of you.

370
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,183
You fools always forget
to bring the bottle opener.

371
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,409
<i>It's been 72 hours since
Quantum & Time CEO Han Tae-sul got shot,</i>

372
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:35,498
<i>but the police haven't even been able
to identify the suspect yet.</i>

373
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:39,502
<i>Initially, the company stated
that CEO Han was doing fine,</i>

374
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,505
-<i>but he hasn't been seen in public,</i>
-See? They're keeping it secret.

375
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:47,676
-<i>raising speculation that he is in danger.</i>
-The society should be transparent.

376
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,431
<i>CEO Han's bodyguard, Yeo,
who got injured at the scene,</i>

377
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,102
<i>is unconscious and in critical condition
at the moment.</i>

378
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,321
That was a good meal.

379
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,365
Seon-ho!

380
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,827
Make me a cup of coffee.

381
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,246
Coffee, anyone? No?

382
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,373
Get it right this time.

383
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,918
One cream, two sugars.

384
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,839
If you get it wrong again, I'll kill you.

385
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:25,756
Yes, sir.

386
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,305
That idiot is so dumb.
He gets it wrong every single time.

387
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,809
Wait and see.
He'll put in two creams and one sugar.

388
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,313
Anyway, did you guys get some rest?

389
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,193
Right.

390
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,865
Now that we've had some food,
let's get down to business.

391
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,119
I'm the owner of Asia Mart.

392
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,999
But this is only a small part
of my business.

393
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,960
Our main focus is…

394
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,921
We're like the unofficial embassy.

395
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:10,801
We look after people
who came here from the other side.

396
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,637
Mr. Han,

397
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,641
the reason I brought you here is--

398
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,310
Why are you trying to kill me?

399
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,270
Kill you?

400
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,522
No!

401
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,942
The folks from the Control Bureau
tried to kill you.

402
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,945
As you can see,
I brought you here safe and sound.

403
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,198
I even got your injuries treated.

404
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,827
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd already be dead.

405
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,497
The Control Bureau? What do they control?

406
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,249
Where's the key? Did you bring it?

407
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,876
What happened to my brother?

408
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,544
Why are you asking me?

409
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,463
That key is mine!

410
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,840
-No, it's mine.
-You little…

411
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,426
What is the Control Bureau?
And what kind of "embassy"?

412
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,553
What happened to my brother?
And the suitcase?

413
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,223
Tae-san fell from the sky.
What is going on?

414
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,307
Why?

415
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,602
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

416
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,272
It'd be better for you to remain unaware.

417
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,947
Fine.

418
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,326
Then let me ask you one last thing.

419
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,079
Think carefully before you answer.

420
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,085
Okay, Mr. Han.

421
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:30,839
Let's say there's something
you regret doing in the past,

422
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,509
and you want to change it.

423
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:37,304
How much would you be willing
to pay for it?

424
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,683
Everything I've got.

425
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,143
"Everything"?

426
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,189
All of it?

427
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,316
I see.

428
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,989
I understand what you mean.

429
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,620
I'll just take this.

430
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,039
-Did you get it right this time?
-Yes.

431
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,332
All right.

432
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,467
See? He got it wrong again.

433
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:19,138
Even though I know
he'd get it wrong every single time,

434
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,849
I can't help it.

435
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,769
You see, the future is…

436
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,814
It's a mirror of the present
and can't be changed.

437
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,191
That's right.

438
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,904
If I tell you,

439
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,073
give me the key.

440
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,742
Okay.

441
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:41,744
All right.

442
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,705
Seeing is believing, so let me show you.

443
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,290
Guys.

444
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:53,047
Show Mr. Han what we exactly do.

445
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,811
Are you really taking them along?
You've never let me go with you.

446
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,064
It's nothing nice.

447
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,191
Fine, if that's what our boss wants.

448
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,446
-Is anyone coming?
-Let's see.

449
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,417
No.

450
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,503
Let me check another server.

451
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,516
That's the downloader.

452
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,727
What is she downloading?

453
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,149
Hold up your hands.

454
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,321
Put this on.

455
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,240
Your hands.

456
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,914
You put this on too.

457
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,291
-Why?
-Why ask?

458
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,543
Don't do it, then.

459
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,348
Why is he aiming the rifle at us?

460
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,016
Is he a robot?

461
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,524
Hey, what do you mean
by "from the other side"?

462
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,067
Where are you from?

463
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,485
That's not important.

464
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,279
Then what is?

465
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,823
The important thing is…

466
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,785
I spotted one.

467
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,122
The temp agencies.

468
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,875
I hate that place.

469
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,210
Why do they keep sending them there?

470
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,629
It's the best place to disguise yourself.

471
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,425
Let's go. Turn around.

472
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,141
Take this.

473
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,602
For motion sickness. Don't puke.

474
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,922
Hey, you.

475
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,591
You're from the other side, aren't you?

476
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,639
You should've reported your arrival
as soon as you got here

477
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,518
and handed over your belongings.
Why did you run away?

478
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,853
Didn't you get any instructions
on your way here?

479
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,064
Nope.

480
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:57,981
"Nope"?

481
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,778
Why are the youngsters these days so rude?

482
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,905
-What's your name?
-Seo-hae.

483
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,740
-And your last name?
-I don't have one.

484
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,370
What about your parents?

485
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,497
I don't have any.

486
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,208
Come on.
No one is born without their parents.

487
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:20,420
What a rude brat.
Fine. Who do you know here?

488
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,381
No one.

489
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,507
No one?

490
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,676
-Not even one?
-Nope.

491
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,263
Okay. Then why did you come here?

492
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,348
Sightseeing.

493
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,518
Sightseeing? That's nice.

494
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,187
Got a death wish?

495
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:38,855
You little…

496
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:46,572
By the way, if you took the downloader,

497
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,740
you--

498
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,873
You need to pay.

499
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,167
There's no such thing as a free ride.

500
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,044
If you don't pay…

501
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,007
Hold on.

502
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,261
Look at this.

503
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,015
What's all this?

504
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:20,522
What are these for?
Are you going to war or something?

505
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,943
Ridiculous. How cute.

506
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,905
What's this?

507
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,409
What is this? A diary or a planner?

508
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,411
Give it back, or I'll kill you.

509
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,079
Damn you.

510
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,341
"Dear Seo-hae,

511
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,510
Happy birthday. By the time--"

512
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:02,439
FOOD, CURRENCY EXCHANGE,
JOB PLACEMENT, INQUIRIES WELCOME

513
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,525
You little…

514
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,944
What's wrong with you?

515
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,780
Sit down. Back to your seat!

516
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,947
Hold on.

517
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,410
Hey, calm down.

518
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,580
That thing's huge.
If you fire it, everyone here will die!

519
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,248
Calm down, please.

520
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,376
This isn't the US.

521
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,879
Can we not resolve conflict without guns?

522
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,090
I'm so not used to this.

523
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,510
You let go of him first and sit down.

524
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,555
And you, put your gun down.
Enough already.

525
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,224
Good. We want peace.

526
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,810
We're good now. Peace.

527
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,856
Why on earth did you read her diary?

528
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,526
Hey, this is mine.

529
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,570
Guys, kill them.

530
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,990
Stop! Let's get this straight.

531
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,659
Why is it yours?

532
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,537
Because everything she brought is mine.

533
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,456
What a nasty jerk.

534
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,793
I'll buy that diary.

535
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,294
Are we good now? I'll buy it.

536
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,297
-For how much?
-How much is it?

537
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,176
It's expensive.

538
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,762
Come on. I'm rich. How much do you want?

539
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,433
A hundred million won?

540
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,602
Her diary costs 100 million won?

541
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,275
Where's my phone?

542
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,609
Hand it over.

543
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,363
Come on, Mr. Han.

544
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,242
If you turn on your phone,

545
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:41,079
it would be like announcing
you're held captive here.

546
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:44,374
Will you call your family,
ask them how they're doing,

547
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,544
call the cops and make a report?
Is that your plan?

548
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,628
No.

549
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,465
The GPS tracker on my phone
is always turned off

550
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:55,218
because my friend, Seung-bok,
always stalks me.

551
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,261
I'm serious.

552
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,388
It will only take ten seconds,
so turn it on and see.

553
00:50:58,972 --> 00:50:59,848
Seung-bok?

554
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:02,976
Give me his phone.

555
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,231
If the GPS is on,

556
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,692
you're dead meat.

557
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,036
It's true.

558
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,207
Here.

559
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,420
See this bank account number?

560
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,590
Send 150 million won here.

561
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,802
Wait, you said 100 million.

562
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,722
There's a fee for using the account.

563
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,058
What's the matter?

564
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,144
Are you reluctant to send it
because it's too much?

565
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,691
"A fee for using the account"?

566
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,569
I've never heard of such a fee.

567
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,864
Fine, 150 million won.

568
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,622
Look, 150 million won.
We're good now, right?

569
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,586
Impressive.

570
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:17,509
This is why the ladies love you.

571
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,513
Just hand over the diary.

572
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,098
All right.

573
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,975
Goodness.

574
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,698
I never asked for your help.

575
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,325
You said you saved my life.
We're even now.

576
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,123
-Do you have the key?
-Why do you ask?

577
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,501
That scumbag will kill you
the moment you give him the key.

578
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,421
I know.

579
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,425
You guys are so chatty.

580
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,678
We're here.

581
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:34,127
-Two plasterers!
-Over here!

582
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,630
Come here! You too.

583
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,132
-Your ID and safety certificate.
-ID and certificate?

584
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,927
-Here you go.
-Get in the car! Your ID and certificate.

585
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,930
-I brought them with me.
-Just get in the car.

586
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:50,268
GWANGSEONG MANUFACTURING
SEONGMUN STAFFING SERVICES

587
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,775
Those illegal immigrants
should get deported!

588
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,197
-Hey, you.
-What did you just say?

589
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,618
Hey! Go back to your country,
you cockroaches!

590
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,662
-What?
-You rat!

591
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,913
What did you say?

592
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:13,041
-You punched me first!
-We can't get jobs because of you punks!

593
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,585
-Damn you.
-Hey!

594
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,838
-We're in this mess because of you!
-You jerk!

595
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,842
-What's your problem?
-You scumbag, let go!

596
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,221
The Control Bureau! They're here!

597
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,187
-My gosh!
-The Control Bureau is here.

598
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,815
They're here. Run!

599
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,567
-Let's go.
-Just run!

600
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,569
-Are they here?
-Go. Hurry!

601
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:45,532
-They're here!
-We're here for an inspection. Don't move.

602
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,451
Don't move!

603
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,130
Is this a crackdown or a ruse?

604
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,381
Back off.

605
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,676
Arrest all those illegal immigrants!
Those scumbags…

606
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,469
Why are you scanning us?

607
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,347
We're all Korean! Arrest them!

608
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,829
-Get them!
-Catch them!

609
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:48,928
You punk.

610
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,515
-Let me go!
-Come here.

611
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,184
Come here.

612
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,102
Let go of me!

613
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,070
Those jerks from the Control Bureau…

614
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,405
Look at them
trying to suppress and control

615
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,450
the small business owners
who work hard to make ends meet.

616
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,079
Then who's responsible
for this country's economy?

617
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,539
What a mess.

618
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,172
Hello, Bingbing.
The Control Bureau is here.

619
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,382
Can you take a look and locate them?

620
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,677
I got one, just now.

621
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,727
-I sent you the coordinates.
-All right.

622
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,112
Mr. Han, let's do some work.

623
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,198
Everyone.

624
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:54,869
It's now time for you to witness
the secret of this hidden world.

625
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:57,997
Let's go.

626
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,730
This is the spot.

627
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,039
What are we waiting for?

628
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,126
-A person.
-Who?

629
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,590
Do you contribute to the National Pension?

630
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,260
I paid 400,000 won this month.

631
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,429
They're thieves. Total swindlers.

632
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,515
We all know that
the pension money will run out by 2040,

633
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,143
but they keep collecting contributions.

634
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,145
Why do you think this is happening?

635
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,814
Weird, right?

636
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,196
But if you think about it,
even weirder things happen.

637
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,907
Have you ever experienced
anything like that?

638
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,450
Such as

639
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,496
seeing a photo of you
that you don't remember taking

640
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,501
or seeing a photo of something
that hasn't happened yet, for example.

641
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,590
<i>When is this?</i>

642
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,967
This is crazy.

643
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,928
The conference in two days.

644
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,599
Why? You've experienced it?

645
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,479
I guess you have!

646
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,732
That's it, Mr. Han!

647
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,152
You're smart, so think about it.

648
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,240
How can something like that happen?

649
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,618
Mr. Han, the important thing

650
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,079
isn't where they come from.

651
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,580
That's not important.

652
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,374
Then what is?

653
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,626
The important thing is…

654
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,004
What matters is

655
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,590
"when."

656
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,850
He's here.

657
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,655
Have you heard of this quote?

658
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:23,411
"The future is already here.

659
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:29,125
It's just not evenly distributed yet."

660
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:30,960
Cool, right?

661
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,359
Welcome to the future.

662
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,277
Welcome to

663
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,279
the future.

664
01:01:24,019 --> 01:01:30,011


665
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,786
<i>You want to know why they come here?</i>

666
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,288
<i>It's because of regret.</i>

667
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,959
<i>Even when they know
they can't change anything,</i>

668
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:56,337
<i>they think,
"Why didn't I do that back then?"</i>

669
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,424
<i>The thought torments them every night.</i>

670
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,555
I know where your brother is.

671
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,682
-What?
-Han Tae-san.

672
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,062
<i>Did you find him?</i>

673
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:21,529
-<i>They got away.</i>
-Find them, then!

674
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,741
Keep tracking Han Tae-sul's phone.

675
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,534
And hijack every signal that it transmits.

676
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:29,829
It's good to see you again, Mr. Han.

677
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,290
Go! Hurry!

678
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,903
