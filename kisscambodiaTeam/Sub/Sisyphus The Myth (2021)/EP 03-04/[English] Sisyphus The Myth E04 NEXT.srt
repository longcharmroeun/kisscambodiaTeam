00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,826
Thirty-eight centimeters…

ICE CREAM!

8
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
<i>Did you find any batteries?</i>

9
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,497
No, everything's taken already.

10
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,209
<i>Same here. We should look somewhere else.</i>

11
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,543
Okay.

12
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,378
<i>I'll see you at Exit 2.</i>

13
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,296
Okay.

00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,572
Let's finish up quickly and go eat.

17
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,077
Hurry up.

18
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,876
What's your number?

19
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,490
Around 250,000.

20
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:03,461
We arrived pretty early.
Theirs are around 10,000.

21
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,817
Downloads are difficult,

22
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,892
so there's only a ten percent chance
of success.

23
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:15,229
And even if they come over,

24
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:18,274
half of them get caught
by the Control Bureau.

25
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:22,111
That means there's only
a five percent chance of surviving

26
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,612
and settling down in Korea.

27
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,450
But they still risk everything
to come over to this side.

28
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,036
Do you get it now?

29
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:33,914
Han Tae-san came here through that.

30
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:39,670
But on the way here,
something went wrong with the downloading.

31
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:46,886
Are you okay?

32
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:49,138
No.

33
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,471
It happens the first time.

34
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,186
<i>Did he take the medicine?</i>

35
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,563
-<i>Tell him not to vomit in the van.</i>
-Goodness.

36
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,902
All right. Stop it.

37
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:04,737
That's enough. Stop it.

38
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:09,367
I'm done talking, so give me the key.

39
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:14,288
Can I go there and watch them?

40
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:18,125
Them? What's there to see?

41
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,757
Fine. Have a look and give me the key.

42
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,342
Okay.

43
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,479
If Tae-sul does anything dumb,
just shoot him.

44
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:39,480
Yes, sir.

45
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,368
Hey.

46
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,037
-What?
-What is that?

47
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,499
-Atropine.
-Why are you using that?

48
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:01,043
They're taught to run
as soon as they arrive.

49
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,631
Why do they come only in their underwear?

50
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,718
They need to transfer the least amount
of information to prevent errors.

51
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,054
What's in that suitcase?

52
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,682
Stuff they want to bring.
Stuff that could be money.

53
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,059
You said they need
the least bit of information.

54
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,271
They can't come empty-handed.
They need money to survive.

55
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,648
Right. But…

56
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:26,318
What if someone's future self comes here?

57
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:29,447
Won't there be any issues
if it's the same identity and information?

58
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,493
Their bodies and memories get mixed.

59
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:37,455
And eventually, one side disappears.

60
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,001
Are they flirting or what?

61
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,967
But why are you taking all their stuff?

62
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,929
-Are you complaining?
-No, I'm not.

63
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,639
Do you have my phone?

64
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:58,809
-What?
-I'm just asking if you have it.

65
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:01,812
Yes. I have it. So what?

66
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,439
Nothing.

67
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,192
Hey, Hayby. Send my location to Seung-bok.

68
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,276
<i>Location sent.</i>

69
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,866
-We found him.
-Really?

70
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:15,618
Got it.

71
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:19,038
Han Tae-sul's phone is on.

72
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,289
He's nearby!

73
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,044
You're not supposed to inject
atropine in the neck.

74
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,170
It's for the thighs.

75
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,509
Hey! Go get him!

76
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,195
Hey.

77
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:57,878
Hey!

78
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,876
You idiot. Catch him at least.

79
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,920
Hurry up and get him!

80
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:18,889
It's the Control Bureau!

81
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:23,269
Darn it.

82
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,396
Let's go.

83
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:36,615
Hurry up!

84
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,827
That jerk.

85
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:44,134
ASIA MART

86
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,339
I have to get out of here.

87
00:13:58,554 --> 00:13:59,680
Han Tae-sul.

88
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:01,724
Help me.

89
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,184
I know where your brother is.

90
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,187
-What?
-Han Tae-san.

91
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,525
I'll tell you where Tae-san is.
Just help me.

92
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,244
Get up. Come on.

93
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:13,712
How could she just run away by herself?

94
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:16,799
Hey. You really know
where my brother is, right?

95
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,259
You'd better not be lying.

96
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:22,304
What?

97
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,848
Darn it!

98
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:29,603
It's good to see you again, Mr. Han.

99
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:34,692
You're right. We should become friends.

100
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:40,322
Go!

101
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,290
-Get them!
-Hey!

102
00:16:04,805 --> 00:16:06,432
Hey, it's an electric car.

103
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:13,939
Wait.

104
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:16,316
Damn it, it's stuck.

105
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:27,911
Get in. Hurry.

106
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:38,255
Hold on. The registration certificate.

107
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:40,507
The registration certificate.

108
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,720
Okay, 39572.

109
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,555
It's 39572.

110
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:50,184
I need the ID and password.

111
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:54,313
But I don't have that,
so I'll install an app first,

112
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,523
enter the VIN,

113
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:59,818
and log in through the manufacturer's
website database.

114
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:12,206
-Excuse me.
-"Sign in." It's not working.

115
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:15,167
Hang on. We don't have time,
so I'll make a new app.

116
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:17,211
Open the Amacs text editor.

117
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,636
The Perl script.

118
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,180
-Mr. Han.
-What?

119
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,474
-The woman.
-What?

120
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,019
That little…

121
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,605
People are watching. Put it away.

122
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,815
Catch her.

123
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,615
Hey! Stop fighting and come over here!

124
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:55,332
Come on. Work!

125
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,668
Why isn't it working?

126
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,592
Come on. Work.

127
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,010
It's working!

128
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,225
Go! Hurry!

129
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:15,894
"Go"? You want us to go?

130
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:18,355
-Hurry up!
-Get them!

131
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:20,274
"Go"? Darn it!

132
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,154
Get them!

133
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,456
Goodness. We finally got you.

134
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,715
Yes. We couldn't catch Han Tae-sul,

135
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:46,675
but we caught the girl who kidnapped him.

136
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,054
Okay. We'll bring her there right now.

137
00:18:58,979 --> 00:18:59,938
Hi.

138
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,108
Hi.

139
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,235
Where did Han Tae-sul go?

140
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:07,779
I don't know.

141
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:09,990
Where did he go?

142
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,284
I don't know.

143
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,080
You're not going to talk?

144
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:20,292
Why did you approach him?

145
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:27,633
Tell me. Why did you approach him?

146
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,388
If you don't talk, I'll kill you.

147
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:36,975
I'm not going to die today.

148
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:41,063
That nonsense again?

149
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:45,359
All right. Let's see if that's true.

150
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,253
Didn't I tell you to hurry?

151
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:48,338
How could you just abandon me?

152
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:50,465
You ran away on your own too!

153
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,717
We're even now, then.

154
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,261
Come on.

155
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,080
<i>I'm home.</i>

156
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:34,468
Why haven't you eaten?
I'm already busy as it is.

157
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:43,351
All you have to do is press one button.
Why can't you do it yourself?

158
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:46,646
What does it say?

159
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:49,691
I can't read it.

160
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,027
Give me that.

161
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:56,823
Over 240? Before eating?

162
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:02,329
Mom, did you eat <i>ramyeon </i>again?

163
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,498
No, I didn't.

164
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:06,291
Mom.

165
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,002
The doctor told you to eat

166
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:12,714
only multigrain rice and vegetables
because of your complications.

167
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,761
But it tastes awful.

168
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:22,307
Don't be ridiculous.
Do you want to become blind?

169
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,475
Eat up.

170
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:27,729
I'm going to die anyway.

171
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:33,568
Then just starve to death!

172
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:37,322
Where are you going? You just got here.

173
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:40,909
I'm on duty today.

174
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,161
Son!

175
00:22:47,874 --> 00:22:49,960
I'll see you later.

176
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:54,506
Whatever.

177
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:18,196
Lieutenant,
can't you just get automatic tickets?

178
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:21,408
The thing is,

179
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,661
a mutual friend of mine

180
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:27,873
won the lottery by choosing
the same numbers on ten tickets.

181
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:31,209
That's impossible. Come on.

182
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,212
It's true.
Lots of people won that way recently.

183
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,511
HOME

184
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,939
-Aren't you going to answer it?
-She always says the same thing.

185
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:55,692
"I can't see well." Stuff like that.

186
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,360
How is she these days?

187
00:23:57,944 --> 00:24:01,031
Same as usual. She doesn't watch her diet.

188
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,700
I hate her.

189
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:08,205
Still, don't treat her like that.

190
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,541
You should do better, Hyeon-gi.

191
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,793
You'll regret it later
when your mother is gone.

192
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,212
Just like I did.

193
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,256
Be good to her while you can.

194
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,384
I will.

195
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:25,597
<i>A robbery at 201, District A.</i>

196
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,559
Thank you. Bye.

197
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:39,778
We're heading there.*

198
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,284
-Why is in this neighborhood?
-My goodness.

199
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,119
-What should we do?
-The cops are here.

200
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:49,579
It's okay. They're here.

201
00:24:49,663 --> 00:24:51,831
-Excuse us.
-It's the cops.

202
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,125
What happened, ma'am?

203
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:57,128
Some guy appeared just in his underwear!

204
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,547
He must be a pervert!

205
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,966
Could he be a flasher?

206
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,052
Which way did he go?

207
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:07,472
That way!

208
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:09,432
It's so scary.

209
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:10,350
Go.

210
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:12,060
-How can he do that?
-All right.

211
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,770
Please calm down.

212
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:15,981
When exactly did you see him?

213
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:18,108
I think it was about 30 minutes ago.

214
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:20,235
You said it was an hour ago.

215
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,487
-Oh, right.
-What did he do after that?

216
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,115
He just ran that way!

217
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,912
<i>Did you find him?</i>

218
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,456
No.

219
00:25:54,644 --> 00:25:56,062
Oh, my gosh!

220
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,028
Excuse me, sir!

221
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:04,529
Water!

222
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,574
Get up.

223
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,492
Get up!

224
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:12,454
Water.

225
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,623
Sir, where did you get this?

226
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,334
You stole it, right?

227
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,510
Just come with me to the station.

228
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:36,227
Sir. You have the right to an attorney,
and the right to defend yourself.

229
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,689
-You may request a review--
-Water!

230
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:40,607
Water.

231
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,526
All right. Fine.

232
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,658
I got the suspect.

233
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,620
-Did he get him?
-He got him!

234
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:59,250
<i>Good work. Let's wrap up and have dinner.</i>

235
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:09,594
Just bring him out.

236
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:11,388
Lieutenant!

237
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,226
<i>Hyeon-gi!</i>

238
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:18,311
Hyeon-gi, what are you doing?

239
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:21,815
Everything is going to end now.

240
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:25,193
Help me.

241
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,153
Come on.

242
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:31,074
What's going on?

243
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,326
What?

244
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:36,746
We'll take care of this.

245
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:39,874
-Who are you?
-Please answer this call.

246
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:44,796
Hello?

247
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,424
Let him go!

248
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:59,185
All right.

249
00:28:02,188 --> 00:28:04,065
I'll call you back when we're done.

250
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:09,028
-Hyeon-gi, come on out. Let's go.
-Officer Jung will come with us.

251
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:12,449
-What's this about?
-We need to do some further investigation.

252
00:28:25,962 --> 00:28:27,756
-Cover his eyes.
-What?

253
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,343
Sir, a text came from Tae-sul
early this morning.

254
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,434
Hello.

255
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:42,437
This is our vice president, Eddy Kim.

256
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,354
Hello.

257
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:46,983
Eddy, he's from
the National Intelligence Service.

258
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,277
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

259
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,576
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed
to reveal my exact position.

260
00:28:57,827 --> 00:29:01,247
I heard Mr. Han
contacted you this morning.

261
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:03,249
-Yes.
-Did you report it to the police?

262
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,503
No, I can't trust them.

263
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:07,962
Good thinking.

264
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,465
And you spoke to him on the phone?

265
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:13,593
No, just a text. He sent his location.

266
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:16,304
If you didn't talk to him yourself,

267
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,140
how can you be sure
that it was him who sent it?

268
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:23,269
No one except Tae-sul
can turn on that phone.

269
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,736
Whether I talked to him
or got a text from him,

270
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,947
it doesn't change the fact
that he was there.

271
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,157
-We have to send someone--
-Mr. Kim.

272
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:40,495
I know you're feeling impatient right now.

273
00:29:41,704 --> 00:29:43,581
I'm sure you're anxious.

274
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:45,959
Could you show me that text?

275
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,836
Of course. Just a minute.

276
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,214
MESSAGES

277
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:58,972
NO MESSAGES

278
00:30:00,557 --> 00:30:01,558
Wait.

279
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:04,227
But I got a message. I definitely got--

280
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,187
When you're feeling anxious,

281
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,232
you may believe
you got a message when you didn't.

282
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:10,984
No, that's impossible.

283
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:11,901
Sir.

284
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:14,737
I will go now.

285
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:17,407
-Okay. I'm sorry for bothering you.
-It's fine.

286
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:19,951
-Wait--
-Eddy.

287
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,673
Keep tracking Han Tae-sul's phone.

288
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:36,009
And hijack every signal that it transmits.

289
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,594
All right.

290
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:45,935
<i>The number you have called
is not available.</i>

291
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:48,313
-<i>Leave a message--</i>
-Why isn't he picking up?

292
00:30:48,396 --> 00:30:49,230
Darn it!

293
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,697
What's the date today?

294
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,783
-August 19.
-It's August 19, 2020.

295
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:04,287
Excuse me.

296
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,332
You said you know where my brother is.
Where should we go?

297
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,793
Imun-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, 192…

298
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,796
Just go to Sinimun Station, Exit 2.

299
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,216
Does that mean my brother's in Imun-dong?

300
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,053
No, I have to stop by somewhere first.

301
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:21,679
Come on!

302
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:30,104
What are you playing at?

303
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,650
I'm taking you with me because
you said you know where my brother is!

304
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:36,361
-Just go there first.
-Where is he?

305
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,904
I have to go there first!

306
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,616
You're driving me nuts.

307
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:43,952
Fine. I'll take you there.

308
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,079
You'd better tell me when we get there.

309
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:31,416
Hey, you.

310
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:34,585
Are you really from the future?

311
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:36,212
Yes.

312
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:39,006
Is that how you predicted
the shooting in Busan?

313
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,343
-Yes.
-And what's with the downloader?

314
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:45,680
I coded that in 2001.

315
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:48,975
There are uploaders in the future.

316
00:32:49,058 --> 00:32:51,978
I don't know how it works,
but it's like a copy machine.

317
00:32:52,562 --> 00:32:55,314
They copy stuff
and send it to the other side.

318
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:57,775
They go inside a huge machine.

319
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,569
It's a quantum teleporter.

320
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:02,864
It teleports objects
by controlling the time value.

321
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:08,995
That's what I demonstrated
at the conference.

322
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:13,332
But controlling the time of humans

323
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:16,127
or other objects
with a huge amount of information

324
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,713
is technically impossible.

325
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,882
I'm not sure,

326
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,301
but it was around 2021
when the uploaders appeared.

327
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,470
What the heck?

328
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:28,389
Why are they coming here?

329
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,641
The success rate
is only about five percent.

330
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:33,436
And what's with
that radiation detector or something?

331
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,855
Are they getting exposed
to radiation on the way?

332
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,777
Hey, stay away from me.
Stick to that side.

333
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:46,532
Then if my brother got into that accident

334
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:48,743
after arriving here on an uploader,

335
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,913
he really is alive right now.

336
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:56,209
-Yes.
-He won't die if he doesn't come back.

337
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,548
Then I should find him
and tell him to never come.

338
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:09,222
And what's with that wedding photo?

339
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,016
Are we going to get married?

340
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,601
How am I supposed to know?

341
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:17,438
It can't be true.
We could've just taken a photo.

342
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:19,398
I'm sorry, but you…

343
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:22,401
Darn it.

344
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:24,070
You're not my type.

345
00:34:24,654 --> 00:34:27,406
-You're not my type either.
-I don't want to get married.

346
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,367
Fortunately, now that we know,

347
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,620
let's agree not to get married
in the future.

348
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,248
Why don't you want to get married?

349
00:34:35,331 --> 00:34:38,751
Never mind.
Just be quiet and stick to that side.

350
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:42,338
-You're annoying.
-I'm way more annoyed than you.

351
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:45,174
Why are you here, then?
Is it like some crazy TV show?

352
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:47,927
Is there some secret behind your birth?
Am I your dad?

353
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,639
-Shut up.
-Okay. What a relief.

354
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,099
I was nervous for a second.

355
00:34:56,644 --> 00:34:57,478
Over here.

356
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:16,956
What's this?

357
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:19,792
Goodness.

358
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:23,880
What's all this?

359
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,123
Mom!

360
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:44,627
I'm home.

361
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,011
You're here.

362
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,737
Who are they? Are they your colleagues?

363
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,032
What took you so long?

364
00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:28,879
I'm sorry.

365
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,549
I'm a bit late.

366
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,067
HWA <i>RAMYEON</i>

367
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:00,119
What the heck is he doing?

368
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:04,749
Mom.

369
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:07,668
You said you wanted
some <i>ramyeon </i>last night, right?

370
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,254
I did.

371
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:12,173
Let's have some <i>ramyeon</i>.

372
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:16,052
You told me not to.

373
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:20,514
It's just a little. It's okay.

374
00:38:21,223 --> 00:38:23,267
Eat up.
It won't taste good if it gets soggy.

375
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:26,395
You should give some to our guests.

376
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:29,065
It's okay. They already ate.

377
00:38:30,232 --> 00:38:32,568
Hurry up before it gets soggy.

378
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:58,677
Is it good?

379
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:01,222
Yes, it's good.

380
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,859
I had this every day when you were young
because we had no money.

381
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:17,863
I'm used to this taste now.

382
00:39:22,535 --> 00:39:23,369
Mom.

383
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:27,456
I even added rice cakes, your favorite.

384
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:30,626
Here.

385
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,428
It's so good.

386
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:20,676
You want to know why they come here?

387
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:26,432
It's because of regret.

388
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:40,321
BOARD MEMBER: EDWARD KIM

389
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:51,373
AUGUST 15, 2020

390
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:55,836
THE VOTE HAS BEEN APPROVED,
CONFIRMING CEO HAN TAE-SUL'S DISMISSAL

391
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:27,201
<i>They come here because of regret.</i>

392
00:41:29,828 --> 00:41:32,831
<i>Even when they know they
can't change anything,</i>

393
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,877
<i>they think,
"Why didn't I do that back then?"</i>

394
00:41:38,254 --> 00:41:40,172
The thought torments them every night.

395
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:44,969
That's what regret is.

396
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:52,643
Mom. I'm sorry.

397
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:58,190
I was always harsh to you

398
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:01,277
and I didn't let you eat what you wanted.

399
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,447
I always came home late,

400
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:10,661
and I always left you at home alone.

401
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:14,456
I'm so sorry.

402
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,209
I know.

403
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,795
It's all right.

404
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,882
Mom.

405
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:27,845
I missed you so much.

406
00:42:30,306 --> 00:42:31,682
I know.

407
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:12,431
Mom. Rest well.

408
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:18,687
I love you so much, Mom.

409
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:27,071
Mom.

410
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:36,580
Mom.

411
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:53,931
So?

412
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:57,393
What about you? What did you regret?

413
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:02,022
Listen carefully.

414
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,525
You may already know,
but they're trying to kill you.

415
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,652
Like who? The Control Bureau?

416
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:10,072
Everyone. Especially Sigma.

417
00:44:10,155 --> 00:44:11,573
"Sigma"?

418
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:19,873
"Sigma"?

419
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,751
Busan was only the beginning.
They'll keep chasing after you.

420
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:26,547
Why are they trying to kill me, though?

421
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:29,716
I'm not sure, but…

422
00:44:32,344 --> 00:44:34,805
It's probably because
you invented the damned uploader.

423
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:38,058
-Me?
-I came to protect you.

424
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,643
And whatever happens,

425
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,563
I'm going to stop you
from inventing the uploader.

426
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:43,939
Why?

427
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,528
Tell me later.

428
00:44:58,579 --> 00:44:59,413
Thank you.

429
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:01,707
The address.

430
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:15,429
You won't like what you'll see there.

431
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:18,599
Just give me the address.

432
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,977
Promise me one thing.
Don't go to the second floor.

433
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,187
The study.

434
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:26,773
And you. Don't go outside.

435
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,650
There's a sniper.

436
00:45:30,152 --> 00:45:32,779
My first mission was to kill you.

437
00:45:34,573 --> 00:45:37,159
Who were you working with?

438
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:38,702
The Control Bureau.

439
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:41,455
I'm really sorry.

440
00:45:42,664 --> 00:45:44,750
I did things that
I shouldn't have done to you.

441
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,376
I'm sorry.

442
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,260
It was August 27.
There was some kind of party.

443
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,307
JONGNO-GU, SEOUL

444
00:46:12,694 --> 00:46:13,737
<i>I found them.</i>

445
00:46:23,372 --> 00:46:25,541
<i>I see Han Tae-sul
and two illegal entrants.</i>

446
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,678
That's the chairman's house.
What happened--

447
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:38,929
Wait.

448
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,117
-Hold fire!
-Hold!

449
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:26,411
Hold fire!

450
00:48:27,162 --> 00:48:28,205
Capture them alive.

451
00:48:57,526 --> 00:48:59,528
Hey! Over here!

452
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,498
It's over now! Surrender!

453
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:15,669
What are you doing?

454
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:17,963
I was thirsty.

455
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,425
Do you want some?
Is there no coke in the future?

456
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:36,273
The boiling point of this butane gas
is -1 degrees.

457
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:37,858
What are you on about?

458
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:44,948
If I do this,
it stays in this bottle as a liquid.

459
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:45,991
And…

460
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:17,689
Let's go!

461
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:22,986
Hey!

462
00:50:25,238 --> 00:50:26,114
The Control Bureau…

463
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:30,118
Run. Take the car.

464
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,631
No matter what I do

465
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:45,884
from now on,

466
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,470
forgive me.

467
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,974
That's the only way you can win.

468
00:50:59,105 --> 00:50:59,940
Sir!

469
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,909
Let's go.

470
00:51:14,955 --> 00:51:16,373
What's going on? Report!

471
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:19,417
We lost communication.
Second unit, going in.

472
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:30,887
That one!

473
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,976
Hey! Seat belt!

474
00:52:11,887 --> 00:52:13,597
They got away.

475
00:52:14,306 --> 00:52:15,265
Find them, then!

-Rewind that.
-Yes, sir.

479
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,341

I found it.

485
00:53:09,277 --> 00:53:11,988
Block the routes and get a drone there.

486
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,603
-It's a drone.
-What? A drone?

487
00:53:45,772 --> 00:53:47,607
Here they go again.

488
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,193
But how did they know our location?

489
00:53:50,276 --> 00:53:53,029
They know everything.
This happened in their past.

490
00:53:53,738 --> 00:53:54,572
My smartphone.

491
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:58,118
My GPS was on!

492
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,879
-That was so close.
-Go faster!

493
00:54:16,928 --> 00:54:20,015
Move aside!

494
00:54:25,103 --> 00:54:26,396
Hey! Watch out!

495
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,320
-Can't you drive properly?
-Why don't you drive, then?

496
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,657
-I can't!
-Why? Can't you drive?

497
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,243
You can shoot guns
and you can climb down a building,

498
00:54:40,326 --> 00:54:41,411
but you can't drive?

499
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:44,497
Are there no cars in the future?
Or are they all self-driving cars?

500
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,499
-Stop talking and just drive!
-Hey.

501
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,753
I don't know what your world is like,
but this is a civilized society.

502
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:52,255
We don't chase people in cars
or shoot guns!

503
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:19,699
I get it. Just drive properly.

504
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:24,079
What just happened?

505
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:25,497
-What is this?
-Who did this?

506
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:30,168
You're attracting everyone's attention.

507
00:55:30,251 --> 00:55:31,586
Is this a game to you?

508
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:35,465
Clean up the scene!

509
00:55:35,548 --> 00:55:37,592
Keep the internet and media quiet,

510
00:55:37,675 --> 00:55:38,802
and send more drones!

511
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,981
What the heck? They're chasing us again!

512
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,942
One, two.

513
00:55:55,944 --> 00:55:58,696
Three, four. There are four of them now.

514
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,989
Those jerks!

515
00:56:00,073 --> 00:56:02,492
They're using my taxes on stuff like this?

516
00:56:05,203 --> 00:56:06,996
We've blocked their escape route.

517
00:56:07,747 --> 00:56:09,624
-Start cornering them.
-Yes, sir.

518
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:17,715
Where did they go?

519
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,508
Go faster! Hurry!

520
00:57:00,592 --> 00:57:02,177
Shut up. I'm trying my best.

521
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:14,355
Hey, watch out!

522
00:57:17,775 --> 00:57:18,651
Duck!

523
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,793
Wait.

524
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:37,837
-What?
-Darn it!

525
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,506
Hold on tight!

526
00:57:55,313 --> 00:57:57,106
We can't just keep running.

527
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,733
Get out and fight them, then!

528
00:58:00,652 --> 00:58:02,195
Hey!

529
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:05,156
-Turn the car around.
-I can't!

530
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,534
-Turn it around.
-I can't turn it now!

531
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:13,081
Hang on. It's 50km/h now.

532
00:58:13,164 --> 00:58:17,335
Ten meters. One, two…

533
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,896
Move!

534
00:58:46,197 --> 00:58:48,283
Hey! Put your seat belt--

535
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:59,961
Good work.
Now, put your seat belt back on.

536
00:59:00,795 --> 00:59:03,339
You too, for turning the car around.

537
00:59:03,423 --> 00:59:04,549
It's nothing.

538
00:59:09,887 --> 00:59:12,223
I'm sure there was one more.
Where did it go?

539
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:39,375
Get lost.

540
01:00:01,606 --> 01:00:03,149
Did you block their escape route?

541
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:05,193
Yes, sir.

542
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,546
Yes, I understand.
But where did the orders come from?

543
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:29,008
How can you not know?

544
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,636
Why do we have to block
a road that's under construction?

545
01:00:32,136 --> 01:00:33,304
Hello?

546
01:00:36,641 --> 01:00:38,643
-Sir.
-Any news from Officer Jung?

547
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:42,021
-No, not yet.
-Where did he go?

548
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,982
-What did you find?
-It's a robbery and murder suspect.

549
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,569
We're doing all this for one robber?

550
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:50,196
Did he rob the Blue House or what?

551
01:00:51,572 --> 01:00:53,783
It says it was just a normal house.

552
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:56,285
REQUEST TO BLOCK SUSPECT'S ESCAPE ROUTE

553
01:00:56,369 --> 01:00:57,328
Hey, what is this?

554
01:00:58,496 --> 01:01:00,039
This is Hyeon-gi's address.

555
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:06,462
What's going on?

556
01:01:12,343 --> 01:01:15,388
-Stop that car.
-Contact the Center! Hurry!

557
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,643
-Hey, look ahead!
-Ahead?

558
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,190
Stop chasing us, you jerks.

559
01:01:26,274 --> 01:01:28,860
Get lost, you assholes!

560
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:31,362
Stop the car!

561
01:01:31,946 --> 01:01:34,115
-Plate number--
-Stop the car!

562
01:01:34,198 --> 01:01:37,160
Plate 5816! Hey!

563
01:01:37,243 --> 01:01:39,328
Hey! Contact the Traffic Center! Hurry!

564
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:41,664
Contact the Center. Page them.

565
01:01:49,547 --> 01:01:51,549
Are they really going to keep chasing us?

566
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,891
What are you waiting for? Speed up.

567
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:10,193
-Go faster!
-This car can't go any faster!

568
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,453
-What's that over there?
-What?

569
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,580
-Over there.
-There?

570
01:02:23,164 --> 01:02:24,790
What? Is the road cut off?

571
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:27,543
-Stop the car!
-Hey!

572
01:02:27,627 --> 01:02:29,545
-Stop the car!
-How can I?

573
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:48,606
This is insane.

574
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:51,651
What happens if we get caught
by the Control Bureau?

575
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,069
Do you really want to know?

576
01:02:53,152 --> 01:02:55,988
No, I was there for a short while.
It wasn't good.

577
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,741
They're all coming out. Let's go.

578
01:02:58,824 --> 01:03:00,618
-What?
-Get out.

579
01:03:04,872 --> 01:03:07,166
Those jerks.

580
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,417
Darn it.

581
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:13,840
What are you doing?

582
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,633
-Take that off.
-What?

583
01:03:15,716 --> 01:03:19,345
Take it off. Leather absorbs water.
You might not be able to swim.

584
01:03:19,846 --> 01:03:20,972
You want to jump?

585
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:22,348
Do you have any other ideas?

586
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:24,934
Mr. Han!

587
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:26,811
Come with us.

588
01:03:27,812 --> 01:03:30,189
The wind is pretty chilly.

589
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,568
It'll just get tougher for you
if you keep stalling.

590
01:03:33,651 --> 01:03:37,280
You're right.
It's so windy, I might fly away!

591
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:41,742
Hey, take off your bag.

592
01:03:43,244 --> 01:03:44,453
What are you doing?

593
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:46,414
-What?
-If you just jump, you'll die.

594
01:03:46,497 --> 01:03:48,374
-You need to think.
-Think about what?

595
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,501
The water won't be cold
this time of the year,

596
01:03:50,585 --> 01:03:53,296
so you have to stretch out your legs
and fall vertically.

597
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:55,298
-How much do you weigh?
-Why do you ask?

598
01:03:55,381 --> 01:03:57,174
-I need to calculate.
-No way.

599
01:03:57,258 --> 01:04:00,011
-Okay, let's say you weigh about 55kg.
-It's 50kg.

600
01:04:00,094 --> 01:04:03,389
What? 50kg? Why are you so skinny?
You need to eat more.

601
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,058
If you drop from this height,

602
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,144
you'll go six to seven meters underwater.

603
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:10,813
The current will be fast,
and you won't see anything.

604
01:04:10,896 --> 01:04:13,316
You won't know which way is up.
So what I mean is,

605
01:04:16,193 --> 01:04:17,445
don't let go of my hand.

606
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:30,166
They won't be able to run away,
so don't shoot. Capture them alive.

607
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,293
Run, on the count of three.

608
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:34,962
One.

609
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,008
Two.

610
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:41,677
Three!

611
01:05:10,247 --> 01:05:11,540
Find them!

612
01:05:38,943 --> 01:05:40,695
<i>Dear Seo-hae,</i>

613
01:05:40,778 --> 01:05:42,571
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

614
01:05:44,031 --> 01:05:48,035
<i>By the time you read this, I'll be dead.</i>

615
01:05:49,996 --> 01:05:54,667
<i>Don't be surprised.
What you're looking at is from yourself.</i>

616
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:00,172
<i>Listen carefully.
There is something we must do.</i>

617
01:06:01,882 --> 01:06:03,926
<i>Take the uploader and go to the past.</i>

618
01:06:05,302 --> 01:06:06,804
<i>Save Han Tae-sul.</i>

619
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:11,142
<i>If he lives, the war can be stopped.</i>

620
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:13,227
<i>Only you can do this.</i>

621
01:06:33,664 --> 01:06:37,251
<i>Han Tae-sul.
Stay away from him at all costs.</i>

622
01:06:37,918 --> 01:06:41,630
<i>You must not cross paths with him.
Don't even talk to him, okay?</i>

623
01:07:22,797 --> 01:07:25,382
A police officer of all people.
Even worse.

624
01:07:26,759 --> 01:07:28,677
Where am I?

625
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:32,723
The Control Bureau.
It's sort of like the Immigration Office.

626
01:07:33,724 --> 01:07:37,269
She broke into your house,
stole your gun and car, and ran away.

627
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:40,523
<i>After contacting an illegal entrant,
Han Tae-sul evaded our pursuit</i>

628
01:07:40,606 --> 01:07:44,276
<i>and ran into 250811 in Busan.
He ran away with her help.</i>

629
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,403
You said you won't let me
make the uploader.

630
01:07:46,487 --> 01:07:47,738
Does it have to do with it?

631
01:07:48,656 --> 01:07:49,573
There will be a war.

632
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:52,535
Everyone will die.

633
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,413
<i>All sorts of mysterious people
will continue to try to kill me.</i>

634
01:07:57,081 --> 01:07:59,041
You're in danger too. Right?

635
01:07:59,124 --> 01:08:00,876
Then let's go our separate ways.

636
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,045
<i>How can I go back?</i>

637
01:08:03,128 --> 01:08:06,841
<i>You're the only person I know
whether from the past, present, or future.</i>

638
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:09,385
<i>-You can't do it on your own.
-No thanks.</i>

639
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:11,720
<i>I prefer working alone.</i>

640
01:08:18,519 --> 01:08:21,480
