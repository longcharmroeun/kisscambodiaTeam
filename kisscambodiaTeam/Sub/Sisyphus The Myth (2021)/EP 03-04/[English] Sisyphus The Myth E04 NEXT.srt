<i>Did you find any batteries?</i>

9
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,046
No, everything's taken already.

10
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,758
<i>Same here. We should look somewhere else.</i>

11
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,093
Okay.

12
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,928
<i>I'll see you at Exit 2.</i>

13
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:09,846

00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,072
Let's finish up quickly and go eat.

18
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,577
Hurry up.

19
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,376
What's your number?

20
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,253
Around 250,000.

21
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,509
We arrived pretty early.
Theirs are around 10,000.

22
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,389
Downloads are difficult,

23
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,392
so there's only a ten percent chance
of success.

24
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,729
And even if they come over,

25
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,773
half of them get caught
by the Control Bureau.

26
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,611
That means there's only
a five percent chance of surviving

27
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,112
and settling down in Korea.

28
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,949
But they still risk everything
to come over to this side.

29
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,535
Do you get it now?

30
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,414
Han Tae-san came here through that.

31
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:29,170
But on the way here,
something went wrong with the downloading.

32
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,385
Are you okay?

33
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,638
No.

34
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,391
It happens the first time.

35
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,685
<i>Did he take the medicine?</i>

36
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,063
-<i>Tell him not to vomit in the van.</i>
-Goodness.

37
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,401
All right. Stop it.

38
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,236
That's enough. Stop it.

39
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,866
I'm done talking, so give me the key.

40
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,788
Can I go there and watch them?

41
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,625
Them? What's there to see?

42
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,256
Fine. Have a look and give me the key.

43
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,841
Okay.

44
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,978
If Tae-sul does anything dumb,
just shoot him.

45
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:28,979
Yes, sir.

46
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,867
Hey.

47
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,537
-What?
-What is that?

48
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,998
-Atropine.
-Why are you using that?

49
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,543
They're taught to run
as soon as they arrive.

50
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,131
Why do they come only in their underwear?

51
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,218
They need to transfer the least amount
of information to prevent errors.

52
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,554
What's in that suitcase?

53
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,181
Stuff they want to bring.
Stuff that could be money.

54
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,559
You said they need
the least bit of information.

55
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,770
They can't come empty-handed.
They need money to survive.

56
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,148
Right. But…

57
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,818
What if someone's future self comes here?

58
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,946
Won't there be any issues
if it's the same identity and information?

59
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,993
Their bodies and memories get mixed.

60
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,954
And eventually, one side disappears.

61
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,500
Are they flirting or what?

62
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,467
But why are you taking all their stuff?

63
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,429
-Are you complaining?
-No, I'm not.

64
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,139
Do you have my phone?

65
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,309
-What?
-I'm just asking if you have it.

66
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,312
Yes. I have it. So what?

67
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,938
Nothing.

68
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,691
Hey, Hayby. Send my location to Seung-bok.

69
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,775
<i>Location sent.</i>

70
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,365
-We found him.
-Really?

71
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,117
Okay, got it.

72
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,537
Han Tae-sul's phone is on.

73
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,788
He's nearby!

74
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,543
You're not supposed to inject
atropine in the neck.

75
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,669
It's for the thighs.

76
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,008
Hey! Go get him!

77
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,694
Hey.

78
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,576
Hey!

79
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,376
You idiot. Catch him at least.

80
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,419
Hurry up and get him!

81
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,389
It's the Control Bureau!

82
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,768
Darn it.

83
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,895
Let's go.

84
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,115
Hurry up!

85
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,326
That jerk.

86
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,664
ASIA MART

87
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,839
I have to get out of here.

88
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,179
Han Tae-sul.

89
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,223
Help me.

90
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,684
I know where your brother is.

91
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,687
-What?
-Han Tae-san.

92
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,025
I'll tell you where Tae-san is.
Just help me.

93
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,744
Get up. Come on.

94
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,212
How could she just run away by herself?

95
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,298
Hey. You really know
where my brother is, right?

96
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,759
You'd better not be lying.

97
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,804
What?

98
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,348
Darn it!

99
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,103
It's good to see you again, Mr. Han.

100
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,191
You're right. We should become friends.

101
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,822
Go!

102
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,576
-Get them!
-Hey!

103
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,931
Hey, it's an electric car.

104
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,439
Wait.

105
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,816
Damn it, it's stuck.

106
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,411
Get in. Hurry.

107
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,755
Hold on. The registration certificate.

108
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,007
The registration certificate.

109
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,219
Okay, 39572.

110
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,055
It's 39572.

111
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,683
I need the ID and password.

112
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,812
But I don't have that,
so I'll install an app first,

113
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,023
enter the VIN,

114
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,318
and log in through the manufacturer's
website database.

115
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,705
-Excuse me.
-"Sign in." It's not working.

116
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,666
Hang on. We don't have time,
so I'll make a new app.

117
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,710
Open the Amacs text editor.

118
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,135
The Perl script.

119
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,679
-Mr. Han.
-What?

120
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,973
-The woman.
-What?

121
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,519
That little…

122
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
People are watching. Put it away.

123
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,314
Catch her.

124
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,115
Hey! Stop fighting and come over here!

125
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,832
Come on. Work!

126
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,167
Why isn't it working?

127
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,092
Come on. Work.

128
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,178
It's working! Okay!

129
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,724
Go! Hurry!

130
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,394
"Go"? You want us to go?

131
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,855
-Hurry up!
-Get them!

132
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,773
"Go"? Darn it!

133
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,654
Get them!

134
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,956
Goodness. We finally got you.

135
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,214
Yes. We couldn't catch Han Tae-sul,

136
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,175
but we caught the girl who kidnapped him.

137
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,554
Okay. We'll bring her there right now.

138
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,438
Hi.

139
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,608
Hi.

140
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,735
Where did Han Tae-sul go?

141
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,279
I don't know.

142
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,489
Where did he go?

143
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,783
I don't know.

144
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,580
You're not going to talk?

145
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,791
Why did you approach him?

146
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,132
Tell me. Why did you approach him?

147
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,888
If you don't talk, I'll kill you.

148
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,475
I'm not going to die today.

149
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,562
That nonsense again?

150
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,858
All right. Let's see if that's true.

151
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,752
Didn't I tell you to hurry?

152
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,838
How could you just abandon me?

153
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,965
You ran away on your own too!

154
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,216
We're even now, then.

155
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,760
Come on.

156
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,580
<i>I'm home.</i>

157
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,967
Why haven't you eaten?
I'm already busy as it is.

158
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:32,851
All you have to do is press one button.
Why can't you do it yourself?

159
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,146
What does it say?

160
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,191
I can't read it.

161
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,526
Give me that.

162
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,323
Over 240? Before eating?

163
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,828
Mom, did you eat <i>ramyeon </i>again?

164
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,997
No, I didn't.

165
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,791
Mom.

166
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,502
The doctor told you to eat

167
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:02,214
only multigrain rice and vegetables
because of your complications.

168
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,260
But it tastes awful.

169
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,807
Don't be ridiculous.
Do you want to become blind?

170
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,974
Eat up.

171
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,229
I'm going to die anyway.

172
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,068
Then just starve to death!

173
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,822
Where are you going? You just got here.

174
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,408
I'm on duty today.

175
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,661
Son!

176
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,459
I'll see you later.

177
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,005
Whatever.

178
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,696
Lieutenant,
can't you just get automatic tickets?

179
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:10,907
The thing is,

180
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,161
a mutual friend of mine

181
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,372
won the lottery by choosing
the same numbers on ten tickets.

182
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,709
That's impossible. Come on.

183
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,712
It's true.
Lots of people won that way recently.

184
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,011
HOME

185
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,439
-Aren't you going to answer it?
-She always says the same thing.

186
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,192
"I can't see well." Stuff like that.

187
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,860
How is she these days?

188
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,530
Same as usual. She doesn't watch her diet.

189
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,200
I hate her.

190
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,704
Still, don't treat her like that.

191
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,041
You should do better, Hyeon-gi.

192
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,293
You'll regret it later
when your mother is gone.

193
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,711
Just like I did.

194
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,756
Be good to her while you can.

195
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,884
I will.

196
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,096
<i>A robbery at 201, District A.</i>

197
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,059
Thank you. Bye.

198
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,277
We're heading there.*

199
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,784
-Why is in this neighborhood?
-My goodness.

200
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,619
-What should we do?
-The cops are here.

201
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,079
It's okay. They're here.

202
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,331
-Excuse us.
-It's the cops.

203
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,625
What happened, ma'am?

204
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,628
Some guy appeared just in his underwear!

205
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,047
He must be a pervert!

206
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,465
Could he be a flasher?

207
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,551
Which way did he go?

208
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,972
That way!

209
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,932
It's so scary.

210
00:25:59,015 --> 00:25:59,849
Go.

211
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,559
-How can he do that?
-All right.

212
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,270
Please calm down.

213
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,480
When exactly did you see him?

214
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,607
I think it was about 30 minutes ago.

215
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,734
You said it was an hour ago.

216
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,987
-Oh, right.
-What did he do after that?

217
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,614
He just ran that way!

218
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,412
<i>Did you find him?</i>

219
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,956
No.

220
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,562
Oh, my gosh!

221
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,527
Excuse me, sir!

222
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,029
Water!

223
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,073
Get up.

224
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,992
Get up!

225
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,953
Water.

226
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,123
Sir, where did you get this?

227
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,833
You stole it, right?

228
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,010
Just come with me to the station.

229
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,727
Sir. You have the right to an attorney,
and the right to defend yourself.

230
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,189
-You may request a review--
-Water!

231
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,106
Water.

232
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,026
All right. Fine.

233
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,158
I got the suspect.

234
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,119
-Did he get him?
-He got him!

235
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,750
<i>Good work. Let's wrap up and have dinner.</i>

236
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,094
Just bring him out.

237
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,887
Lieutenant!

238
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,725
<i>Hyeon-gi!</i>

239
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,811
Hyeon-gi, what are you doing?

240
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,314
Everything is going to end now.

241
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,692
Help me.

242
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,653
Come on.

243
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,573
What's going on?

244
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,826
What?

245
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,246
We'll take care of this.

246
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,374
-Who are you?
-Please answer this call.

247
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,295
Hello?

248
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,923
Let him go!

249
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,685
All right.

250
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,565
I'll call you back when we're done.

251
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,528
-Hyeon-gi, come on out. Let's go.
-Officer Jung will come with us.

252
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,948
-What's this about?
-We need to do some further investigation.

253
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,255
-Cover his eyes.
-What?

254
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,843
Sir, a text came from Tae-sul
early this morning.

255
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:28,933
Hello.

256
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,936
This is our vice president, Eddy Kim.

257
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,854
Hello.

258
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,483
Eddy, he's from
the National Intelligence Service.

259
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,777
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

260
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,075
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed
to reveal my exact position.

261
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,747
I heard Mr. Han
contacted you this morning.

262
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,749
-Yes.
-Did you report it to the police?

263
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,002
No, I can't trust them.

264
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,462
Good thinking.

265
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,964
And you spoke to him on the phone?

266
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,092
No, just a text. He sent his location.

267
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,804
If you didn't talk to him yourself,

268
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,640
how can you be sure
that it was him who sent it?

269
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,769
No one except Tae-sul
can turn on that phone.

270
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,236
Whether I talked to him
or got a text from him,

271
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,446
it doesn't change the fact
that he was there.

272
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,657
-We have to send someone--
-Mr. Kim.

273
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,994
I know you're feeling impatient right now.

274
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,081
I'm sure you're anxious.

275
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,458
Could you show me that text?

276
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,335
Of course. Just a minute.

277
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,713
MESSAGES

278
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,471
NO MESSAGES

279
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,057
Wait.

280
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,726
But I got a message. I definitely got--

281
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,687
When you're feeling anxious,

282
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,731
you may believe
you got a message when you didn't.

283
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,483
No, that's impossible.

284
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,401
Sir.

285
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,237
I will go now.

286
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,906
-Okay. I'm sorry for bothering you.
-It's fine.

287
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,450
-Wait--
-Eddy.

288
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,172
Keep tracking Han Tae-sul's phone.

289
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,508
And hijack every signal that it transmits.

290
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,093
All right.

291
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,435
<i>The number you have called
is not available.</i>

292
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,812
-<i>Leave a message--</i>
-Why isn't he picking up?

293
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,730
Darn it!

294
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,196
What's the date today?

295
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,283
-August 19.
-It's August 19, 2020.

296
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,786
Excuse me.

297
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,831
You said you know where my brother is.
Where should we go?

298
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,293
Imun-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, 192…

299
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,296
Just go to Sinimun Station, Exit 2.

300
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,716
Does that mean my brother's in Imun-dong?

301
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,552
No, I have to stop by somewhere first.

302
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,179
Come on!

303
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,604
What are you playing at?

304
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:23,149
I'm taking you with me because
you said you know where my brother is!

305
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,860
-Just go there first.
-Where is he?

306
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,403
I have to go there first!

307
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,115
You're driving me nuts.

308
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,451
Fine. I'll take you there.

309
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,578
You'd better tell me when we get there.

310
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,915
Hey, you.

311
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,085
Are you really from the future?

312
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,712
Yes.

313
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,506
Is that how you predicted
the shooting in Busan?

314
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,843
-Yes.
-And what's with the downloader?

315
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,179
I coded that in 2001.

316
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,474
There are uploaders in the future.

317
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,477
I don't know how it works,
but it's like a copy machine.

318
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,814
They copy stuff
and send it to the other side.

319
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,275
They go inside a huge machine.

320
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,068
It's a quantum teleporter.

321
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,363
It teleports objects
by controlling the time value.

322
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,494
That's what I demonstrated
at the conference.

323
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,832
But controlling the time of humans

324
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,626
or other objects
with a huge amount of information

325
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,212
is technically impossible.

326
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,381
I'm not sure,

327
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,800
but it was around 2021
when the uploaders appeared.

328
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,969
What the heck?

329
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,889
Why are they coming here?

330
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,141
The success rate
is only about five percent.

331
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,935
And what's with
that radiation detector or something?

332
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,354
Are they getting exposed
to radiation on the way?

333
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,276
Hey, stay away from me.
Stick to that side.

334
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:36,032
Then if my brother got into that accident

335
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,242
after arriving here on an uploader,

336
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,412
he really is alive right now.

337
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,708
-Yes.
-He won't die if he doesn't come back.

338
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,048
Then I should find him
and tell him to never come.

339
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,721
And what's with that wedding photo?

340
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,516
Are we going to get married?

341
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,101
How am I supposed to know?

342
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,938
It can't be true.
We could've just taken a photo.

343
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,898
I'm sorry, but you…

344
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,901
Darn it.

345
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,569
You're not my type.

346
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,906
-You're not my type either.
-I don't want to get married.

347
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,866
Fortunately, now that we know,

348
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,120
let's agree not to get married
in the future.

349
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,747
Why don't you want to get married?

350
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,251
Never mind.
Just be quiet and stick to that side.

351
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,838
-You're annoying.
-I'm way more annoyed than you.

352
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,674
Why are you here, then?
Is it like some crazy TV show?

353
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,426
Is there some secret behind your birth?
Am I your dad?

354
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,139
-Shut up.
-Okay. What a relief.

355
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,598
I was nervous for a second.

356
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:46,978
Over here.

357
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,455
What's this?

358
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,292
Goodness.

359
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,379
What's all this?

360
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,623
Mom!

361
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,126
I'm home.

362
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,511
You're here.

363
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,237
Who are they? Are they your colleagues?

364
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,532
What took you so long?

365
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,379
I'm sorry.

366
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,048
I'm a bit late.

367
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,567
HWA <i>RAMYEON</i>

368
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,618
What the heck is he doing?

369
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,248
Mom.

370
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,168
You said you wanted
some <i>ramyeon </i>last night, right?

371
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,754
I did.

372
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,672
Let's have some <i>ramyeon</i>.

373
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,551
You told me not to.

374
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,014
It's just a little. It's okay.

375
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,767
Eat up.
It won't taste good if it gets soggy.

376
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,895
You should give some to our guests.

377
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,564
It's okay. They already ate.

378
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,068
Hurry up before it gets soggy.

379
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,177
Is it good?

380
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,721
Yes, it's good.

381
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,359
I had this every day when you were young
because we had no money.

382
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,363
I'm used to this taste now.

383
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:12,868
Mom.

384
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,956
I even added rice cakes, your favorite.

385
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,126
Here.

386
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,928
It's so good.

387
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,176
You want to know why they come here?

388
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,931
It's because of regret.

389
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,820
BOARD MEMBER: EDWARD KIM

390
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,873
AUGUST 15, 2020

391
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:45,336
THE VOTE HAS BEEN APPROVED,
CONFIRMING CEO HAN TAE-SUL'S DISMISSAL

392
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,700
<i>They come here because of regret.</i>

393
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,331
<i>Even when they know they
can't change anything,</i>

394
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,377
<i>they think,
"Why didn't I do that back then?"</i>

395
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,672
The thought torments them every night.

396
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,468
That's what regret is.

397
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,142
Mom. I'm sorry.

398
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:47,690
I was always harsh to you

399
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,776
and I didn't let you eat what you wanted.

400
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,947
I always came home late,

401
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:00,160
and I always left you at home alone.

402
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,956
I'm so sorry.

403
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,709
I know.

404
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,295
It's all right.

405
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,382
Mom.

406
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,344
I missed you so much.

407
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,181
I know.

408
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,930
Mom. Rest well.

409
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,187
I love you so much, Mom.

410
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,570
Mom.

411
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,080
Mom.

412
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,430
So?

413
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,892
What about you? What did you regret?

414
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,522
Listen carefully.

415
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,024
You may already know,
but they're trying to kill you.

416
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,151
Like who? The Control Bureau?

417
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,571
Everyone. Especially Sigma.

418
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,073
"Sigma"?

419
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,373
"Sigma"?

420
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,251
Busan was only the beginning.
They'll keep chasing after you.

421
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,046
Why are they trying to kill me, though?

422
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,216
I'm not sure, but…

423
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,304
It's probably because
you invented the damned uploader.

424
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,558
-Me?
-I came to protect you.

425
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,143
And whatever happens,

426
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,062
I'm going to stop you
from inventing the uploader.

427
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,439
Why?

428
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,027
Tell me later.

429
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:48,912
Thank you.

430
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,206
The address.

431
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,928
You won't like what you'll see there.

432
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,098
Just give me the address.

433
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,477
Promise me one thing.
Don't go to the second floor.

434
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,686
The study.

435
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,273
And you. Don't go outside.

436
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,150
There's a sniper.

437
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,279
My first mission was to kill you.

438
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,658
Who were you working with?

439
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,202
The Control Bureau.

440
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,954
I'm really sorry.

441
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,249
I did things that
I shouldn't have done to you.

442
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:35,876
I'm sorry.

443
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,760
It was August 27.
There was some kind of party.

444
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,806
JONGNO-GU, SEOUL

445
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,237
<i>I found them.</i>

446
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,040
<i>I see Han Tae-sul
and two illegal entrants.</i>

447
00:47:24,597 --> 00:47:27,224
That's the chairman's house.
What happened--

448
00:47:27,308 --> 00:47:28,475
Wait.

449
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,664
-Hold fire!
-Hold!

450
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:15,958
Hold fire!

451
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:17,751
Capture them alive.

452
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,074
Hey! Over here!

453
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:01,044
It's over now! Surrender!

454
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:05,215
What are you doing?

455
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,509
I was thirsty.

456
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,971
Do you want some?
Is there no coke in the future?

457
00:50:21,023 --> 00:50:25,819
The boiling point of this butane gas
is -1 degrees.

458
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:27,404
What are you on about?

459
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,495
If I do this,
it stays in this bottle as a liquid.

460
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:35,537
And…

461
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:07,236
Let's go!

462
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,533
Hey!

463
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:15,661
The Control Bureau…

464
00:51:16,328 --> 00:51:19,665
Run. Take the car.

465
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,177
No matter what I do

466
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,430
from now on,

467
00:51:36,557 --> 00:51:38,016
forgive me.

468
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:42,521
That's the only way you can win.

469
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:49,486
Sir!

470
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:00,455
Let's go.

471
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:05,919
What's going on? Report!

472
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:08,964
We lost communication.
Second unit, going in.

473
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,434
That one!

474
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:25,522
Hey! Seat belt!

475
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:03,143
They got away.

476
00:53:03,852 --> 00:53:04,811
Find them, then!

-Rewind that.
-Yes, sir.

480
00:53:37,344 --> 00:53:38,887

I found it.

486
00:53:58,824 --> 00:54:01,535
Block the routes and get a drone there.

487
00:54:30,731 --> 00:54:33,150
-It's a drone.
-What? A drone?

488
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:37,154
Here they go again.

489
00:54:37,237 --> 00:54:39,740
But how did they know our location?

490
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:42,576
They know everything.
This happened in their past.

491
00:54:43,285 --> 00:54:44,119
My smartphone.

492
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:47,664
My GPS was on!

493
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,426
-That was so close.
-Go faster!

494
00:55:06,475 --> 00:55:09,561
Move aside!

495
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:15,942
Hey! Watch out!

496
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:23,867
-Can't you drive properly?
-Why don't you drive, then?

497
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,204
-I can't!
-Why? Can't you drive?

498
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:29,790
You can shoot guns
and you can climb down a building,

499
00:55:29,873 --> 00:55:30,957
but you can't drive?

500
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:34,044
Are there no cars in the future?
Or are they all self-driving cars?

501
00:55:34,127 --> 00:55:36,046
-Stop talking and just drive!
-Hey.

502
00:55:36,129 --> 00:55:39,299
I don't know what your world is like,
but this is a civilized society.

503
00:55:39,382 --> 00:55:41,802
We don't chase people in cars
or shoot guns!

504
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:09,246
I get it. Just drive properly.

505
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,625
What just happened?

506
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,043
-What is this?
-Who did this?

507
00:56:16,795 --> 00:56:19,714
You're attracting everyone's attention.

508
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:21,133
Is this a game to you?

509
00:56:23,301 --> 00:56:25,011
Clean up the scene!

510
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:27,139
Keep the internet and media quiet,

511
00:56:27,222 --> 00:56:28,348
and send more drones!

512
00:56:39,693 --> 00:56:41,528
What the heck? They're chasing us again!

513
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:43,488
One, two.

514
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,243
Three, four. There are four of them now.

515
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:49,536
Those jerks!

516
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,038
They're using my taxes on stuff like this?

517
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,543
We've blocked their escape route.

518
00:56:57,294 --> 00:56:59,171
-Start cornering them.
-Yes, sir.

519
00:57:06,428 --> 00:57:07,262
Where did they go?

520
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:50,055
Go faster! Hurry!

521
00:57:50,138 --> 00:57:51,723
Shut up. I'm trying my best.

522
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:03,902
Hey, watch out!

523
00:58:07,322 --> 00:58:08,198
Duck!

524
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:15,247
Okay!

525
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:25,340
Wait.

526
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:27,384
-What?
-Darn it!

527
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:29,052
Hold on tight!

528
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,653
We can't just keep running.

529
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:48,280
Get out and fight them, then!

530
00:58:50,198 --> 00:58:51,741
Hey!

531
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:54,703
-Turn the car around.
-I can't!

532
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:57,080
-Turn it around.
-I can't turn it now!

533
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:02,627
Hang on. It's 50km/h now.

534
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:06,881
Ten meters. One, two…

535
00:59:25,025 --> 00:59:26,443
Move!

536
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:37,829
Hey! Put your seat belt--

537
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:49,507
Good work.
Now, put your seat belt back on.

538
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:52,886
You too, for turning the car around.

539
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:54,095
It's nothing.

540
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:01,770
I'm sure there was one more.
Where did it go?

541
01:00:27,879 --> 01:00:28,922
Get lost.

542
01:00:51,152 --> 01:00:52,696
Did you block their escape route?

543
01:00:53,822 --> 01:00:54,739
Yes, sir.

544
01:01:11,297 --> 01:01:15,093
Yes, I understand.
But where did the orders come from?

545
01:01:16,428 --> 01:01:18,555
How can you not know?

546
01:01:18,638 --> 01:01:21,182
Why do we have to block
a road that's under construction?

547
01:01:21,683 --> 01:01:22,851
Hello?

548
01:01:26,187 --> 01:01:28,189
-Sir.
-Any news from Officer Jung?

549
01:01:28,273 --> 01:01:31,568
-No, not yet.
-Where did he go?

550
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:34,529
-What did you find?
-It's a robbery and murder suspect.

551
01:01:35,447 --> 01:01:38,116
We're doing all this for one robber?

552
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:39,743
Did he rob the Blue House or what?

553
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,329
It says it was just a normal house.

554
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:45,832
REQUEST TO BLOCK SUSPECT'S ESCAPE ROUTE

555
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:46,875
Hey, what is this?

556
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:49,586
This is Hyeon-gi's address.

557
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:56,009
What's going on?

558
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,934
-Stop that car.
-Contact the Center! Hurry!

559
01:02:09,022 --> 01:02:10,190
-Hey, look ahead!
-Ahead?

560
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,737
Stop chasing us, you jerks.

561
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,406
Get lost, you assholes!

562
01:02:19,491 --> 01:02:20,909
Stop the car!

563
01:02:21,493 --> 01:02:23,661
-Plate number--
-Stop the car!

564
01:02:23,745 --> 01:02:26,706
Plate 5816! Hey!

565
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,875
Hey! Contact the Traffic Center! Hurry!

566
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:31,211
Contact the Center. Page them.

567
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:41,095
Are they really going to keep chasing us?

568
01:02:46,726 --> 01:02:49,437
What are you waiting for? Speed up.

569
01:02:56,569 --> 01:02:59,739
-Go faster!
-This car can't go any faster!

570
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:09,999
-What's that over there?
-What?

571
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:12,126
-Over there.
-There?

572
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,337
What? Is the road cut off?

573
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,090
-Stop the car!
-Hey!

574
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:19,092
-Stop the car!
-How can I?

575
01:03:36,109 --> 01:03:38,152
This is insane.

576
01:03:38,236 --> 01:03:41,197
What happens if we get caught
by the Control Bureau?

577
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:42,615
Do you really want to know?

578
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:45,535
No, I was there for a short while.
It wasn't good.

579
01:03:45,618 --> 01:03:48,288
They're all coming out. Let's go.

580
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:50,164
-What?
-Get out.

581
01:03:54,419 --> 01:03:56,713
Those jerks.

582
01:03:56,796 --> 01:03:57,964
Darn it.

583
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:03,386
What are you doing?

584
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:05,179
-Take that off.
-What?

585
01:04:05,263 --> 01:04:08,892
Take it off. Leather absorbs water.
You might not be able to swim.

586
01:04:09,392 --> 01:04:10,518
You want to jump?

587
01:04:10,602 --> 01:04:11,895
Do you have any other ideas?

588
01:04:12,687 --> 01:04:14,480
Mr. Han!

589
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:16,357
Come with us.

590
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:19,736
The wind is pretty chilly.

591
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:23,114
It'll just get tougher for you
if you keep stalling.

592
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:26,826
You're right.
It's so windy, I might fly away!

593
01:04:29,787 --> 01:04:31,289
Hey, take off your bag.

594
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,000
What are you doing?

595
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,960
-What?
-If you just jump, you'll die.

596
01:04:36,044 --> 01:04:37,921
-You need to think.
-Think about what?

597
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:40,048
The water won't be cold
this time of the year,

598
01:04:40,131 --> 01:04:42,842
so you have to stretch out your legs
and fall vertically.

599
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:44,844
-How much do you weigh?
-Why do you ask?

600
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:46,721
-I need to calculate.
-No way.

601
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:49,557
-Okay, let's say you weigh about 55kg.
-It's 50kg.

602
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:52,936
What? 50kg? Why are you so skinny?
You need to eat more.

603
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:55,605
If you drop from this height,

604
01:04:55,688 --> 01:04:57,690
you'll go six to seven meters underwater.

605
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:00,360
The current will be fast,
and you won't see anything.

606
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:02,862
You won't know which way is up.
So what I mean is,

607
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,991
don't let go of my hand.

608
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,712
They won't be able to run away,
so don't shoot. Capture them alive.

609
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:21,839
Run, on the count of three.

610
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:24,509
One.

611
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:28,554
Two.

612
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:31,224
Three!

613
01:05:59,794 --> 01:06:01,087
Find them!

614
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:30,241
<i>Dear Seo-hae,</i>

615
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:32,118
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

616
01:06:33,578 --> 01:06:37,582
<i>By the time you read this, I'll be dead.</i>

617
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:44,213
<i>Don't be surprised.
What you're looking at is from yourself.</i>

618
01:06:46,466 --> 01:06:49,719
<i>Listen carefully.
There is something we must do.</i>

619
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:53,473
<i>Take the uploader and go to the past.</i>

620
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:56,350
<i>Save Han Tae-sul.</i>

621
01:06:58,436 --> 01:07:00,688
<i>If he lives, the war can be stopped.</i>

622
01:07:01,606 --> 01:07:02,774
<i>Only you can do this.</i>

623
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:26,798
<i>Han Tae-sul.
Stay away from him at all costs.</i>

624
01:07:27,465 --> 01:07:31,177
<i>You must not cross paths with him.
Don't even talk to him, okay?</i>

625
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:14,929
A police officer of all people.
Even worse.

626
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:18,224
Where am I?

627
01:08:19,392 --> 01:08:22,270
The Control Bureau.
It's sort of like the Immigration Office.

628
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:26,816
She broke into your house,
stole your gun and car, and ran away.

629
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:30,069
<i>After contacting an illegal entrant,
Han Tae-sul evaded our pursuit</i>

630
01:08:30,153 --> 01:08:33,823
<i>and ran into 250811 in Busan.
He ran away with her help.</i>

631
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:35,950
You said you won't let me
make the uploader.

632
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:37,285
Does it have to do with it?

633
01:08:38,202 --> 01:08:39,120
There will be a war.

634
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:42,081
Everyone will die.

635
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:45,960
<i>All sorts of mysterious people
will continue to try to kill me.</i>

636
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:48,588
You're in danger too. Right?

637
01:08:48,671 --> 01:08:50,423
Then let's go our separate ways.

638
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:52,592
<i>How can I go back?</i>

639
01:08:52,675 --> 01:08:56,387
<i>You're the only person I know
whether from the past, present, or future.</i>

640
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,931
<i>-You can't do it on your own.
-No thanks.</i>

641
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:01,267
<i>I prefer working alone.</i>
