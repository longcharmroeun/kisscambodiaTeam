ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:36,060
Seo-hae, wake up.

3
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,105
Seo-hae.

4
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,233
Dad.

5
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,444
Time to go. It's your turn now.

6
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:08,384
<i>Anything that weighs over 30kg
is not allowed in.</i>

7
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,928
<i>Microbial substances, living creatures,</i>

8
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:14,056
<i>and explosive materials are not permitted.</i>

9
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:17,101
<i>We assume no responsibility
and shall not be liable</i>

10
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:19,311
<i>for any injury, death, and accidents</i>

11
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:21,147
<i>that occurs during your trip.</i>

12
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:27,528
-Form a line.
-You must get tested before you board!

13
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:29,738
-Move forward!
-Put your belongings in your suitcase.

14
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:31,157
-You may go.
-Move forward!

15
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,117
Let's meet again, alive and well.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,577
-Move forward.
-Move forward!

17
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,080
-You, over there. It's this way!
-Hey, move it.

18
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,719
Let's go together, Dad.

19
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,139
I don't think I can go with you.

20
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,686
Tell me what I told you.

21
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,189
First, when you arrive.

22
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:06,692
When you arrive!

23
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,152
"Start running."

24
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:10,821
Do not let anyone catch you,
no matter what.

25
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,283
If you get caught,
just don't say anything.

26
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,495
Just pretend you can't talk. Okay?

27
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:21,874
Yes. But let's go together--

28
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:22,791
Second.

29
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:26,670
Hurry up!

30
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,717
"Do not trust anyone."

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,846
You never know who's your ally
and who's your real enemy.

32
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:39,725
Don't trust anyone. No one. Okay?

33
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,604
-Okay.
-Good.

34
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:45,940
What was the third thing?

35
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:49,610
Come on.

36
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:52,321
-Number 250811!
-Coming!

37
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:56,367
Quick. What was it?

38
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:01,038
"Han Tae-sul."

39
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:05,751
Han Tae-sul.
Stay away from him at all costs.

40
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,089
You must not cross paths with him.
Don't even talk to him, okay?

41
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,091
Then what about Mom?

42
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,218
What if she dies?

43
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:19,723
We all die in the end.

44
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,564
But I can't leave you alone here, Dad.

45
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,742
When you get there,
you'll find lots of good food

46
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,953
and all of your favorite fruits.

47
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,914
Real fruit, not the canned ones.

48
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:46,834
So just go.

49
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,461
Eat everything you want.

50
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,630
And do whatever you want.

51
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,718
Just enjoy your life.

52
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:00,431
Promise me.

53
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:03,100
-Number 250811!
-Coming!

54
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:06,645
Promise me.

55
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,939
If you don't, I won't let you go.

56
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:22,161
Let's go.

57
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,208
Catch her!

58
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:52,991
Darn it.

59
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,371
Hey! You, come here.

60
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:59,998
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

61
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,084
You call this <i>ramyeon</i>?

62
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:05,254
Are you blind? Look at this.

63
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:08,006
The noodles turned completely soggy.

64
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,468
How dare you make me eat this trash?

65
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:13,887
You eat this.

66
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:16,848
What? You can't either, can you?

67
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:21,186
I want you to scarf it down
and make me a new one. Okay?

68
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:22,688
Hey.

69
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:24,982
The new one will taste the same.

70
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,567
Where are we now?

71
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:30,988
We're 10,000m above the ground.

72
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:34,282
The low air pressure
lowers the boiling point.

73
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:38,328
That's why your noodles taste bad.
Didn't you learn in science class?

74
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:40,747
Who are you?

75
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,284
HAN TAE-SUL, QUANTUM & TIME

76
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:08,233
They took my picture
when I was at the lab,

77
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,027
so I don't look that good.

78
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:12,988
Next month, you'll see
my Hawaiian-themed photos.

79
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,826
If you give me your contact information,
I'll send them to you.

80
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,328
Have you been to Hawaii?

81
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:21,997
No.

82
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,207
Me neither.

83
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,877
-Why do you ask?
-You know…

84
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:30,672
If I ever fall in love with someone,
I want to take her there.

85
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:36,303
Just saying.

86
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:39,556
So just thank her for the noodles
and finish it.

87
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,559
Hey!

88
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:47,856
I don't want to.

89
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:55,822
In that case,
this evening or tomorrow morning,

90
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:58,909
"rude <i>ramyeon</i> guy"
will be all over the Internet.

91
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:03,080
<i>Are you blind? Look at this.
The noodles turned completely soggy.</i>

92
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,832
<i>How dare you make me eat this trash?</i>

93
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:06,875
Damn it.

94
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,668
<i>You eat this.</i>

95
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:11,880
Thank you.

96
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,966
Excuse me. May I have a glass of water?

97
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,551
Coming right up.

98
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,804
Your number too.

99
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,077
But she's not your type.

100
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:44,287
I have to say

101
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:47,499
these first-class seats
are super comfortable.

102
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,502
I'm really proud of you, little brother.

103
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:54,005
And the quality of this wine is top-notch.

104
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,216
You should have a glass too.

105
00:12:57,926 --> 00:13:00,637
You see, Tae-sul,
there's this article I read.

106
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,891
If the brain is stressed all the time
like yours is…

107
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,268
What was that?

108
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:07,686
Right, adrenaline.

109
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,313
The body produces it,
which weakens the immune system.

110
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:11,898
I read it in the newspaper.

111
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:16,820
Hey, Tae-sul.

112
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:19,114
I'm talking to you. Look at me.

113
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:21,825
Are you mad at me or something?

114
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,702
Why are you ignoring me?

115
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:26,663
Because…

116
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,001
you're dead.

117
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:35,046
Here's your water.

118
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,038
Stay seated.

119
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:10,874
-Fasten your seat belts.
-Don't worry. It must be some turbulence.

120
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:12,250
Stay seated.

121
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:25,138
What's going on?

122
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:30,435
Got it.

123
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:38,276
Please fasten your seat belt.

124
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:41,238
<i>We're experiencing some turbulence…</i>

125
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,698
-<i>…at the moment.</i>
-Your seat belt, please.

126
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,784
<i>Please return to your seats</i>

127
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,911
and keep your seat belts fastened.

128
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,754
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

129
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,970
Captain.

130
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,222
Captain!

131
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:25,490
Stewardess!

132
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:27,951
Are you okay?

133
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:28,094
<i>Tae-sul.</i>

134
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:29,804
Tae-sul!

135
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:32,057
Han Tae-sul!

136
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:08,176
Sir, wake up. Sir!

137
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:13,390
Hey! Wake up, sir!

138
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:19,437
Wake up!

139
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:30,365
What is going on?

140
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:33,368
Someone just…

141
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:36,746
Right over there.

142
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:44,629
Captain.

143
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:47,716
Captain!

144
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:56,433
Please stay in your seats!

145
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:05,984
What are you doing?

146
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,862
Can't you tell?
I'm trying to fix the plane.

147
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:10,655
With that?

148
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:12,073
During World War II,

149
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,033
they used this to fix aircraft.

150
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,260
I told you.

151
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:52,697
Let's see.

152
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,617
It's hovering around 150.
It's about to stall!

153
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,576
Hold on.

154
00:18:59,662 --> 00:19:01,748
The power's out
only for the control panel.

155
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:04,167
Can you make a safe landing
if I get it running again?

156
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,084
What?

157
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:06,544
Can you?

158
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:07,545
Yes.

159
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:11,257
We're at 20,000 feet above sea level now.

160
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,760
That means we've got
3 minutes and 30 seconds.

161
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:21,726
Let me know every 30 seconds. Okay?

162
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,394
Hurry!

163
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:36,866
Thirty seconds down.

164
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,076
Okay.

165
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,537
I'm going to divert the current
using a magnet.

166
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,163
It's…

167
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,251
Okay, let's go.

168
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:54,884
What are you doing?

169
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,637
You can't break that thing!

170
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,347
There's a magnet in this panel.

171
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,268
Here it is. Do you need this now?

172
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:04,310
We're going to crash!

173
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:12,026
This is nerve-wracking.

174
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:19,951
All right, let's see.

175
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,829
Which one's broken? Hold on.

176
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:25,373
Another 30 seconds down.
Only 2.5 minutes left.

177
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,335
This is the one.

178
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:30,795
Do you have a lighter?

179
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,194
SEUNG-BOK

180
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:41,431
Hey. Hey, look!

181
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:42,557
What?

182
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,894
Jeez, this prick. I'm busy right now.

183
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:47,395
I need to take this call.

184
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:49,480
Hey, Seung-bok.

185
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,984
Where are you now? I couldn't reach you!

186
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:55,820
-The board members are angry.
-It's been hours.

187
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:57,864
Why isn't he coming?

188
00:20:58,406 --> 00:21:00,783
This is Mr. Han. I got a hold of him.

189
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:08,333
<i>You'll get fired if you keep missing
the board meeting and causing trouble.</i>

190
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,959
Who can fire me? It's my company.

191
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:12,462
Anyway, where are you now?

192
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:14,380
Me? On an airplane.

193
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:16,132
Airplane…

194
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:18,009
Then how did this call get through?

195
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,803
The plane's falling now.

196
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:22,055
What?

197
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,269
I'm not in the mood for jokes right now.

198
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,356
<i>I'm serious.
You can get a signal at lower altitudes.</i>

199
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,316
You said you couldn't reach me earlier.

200
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,026
That's enough.

201
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:38,112
You need to call 911 or the airport now.

202
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,949
<i>Air Koreana JH007, arriving from Saipan.</i>

203
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,993
<i>The plane's about to crash in Seoul.</i>

204
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,579
We're flying below 10,000 feet
at the moment.

205
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:48,831
And the current speed is 100 knots.

206
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:51,668
Captain! The captain's dead.

207
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:54,253
And the copilot. He's not doing well.

208
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,380
<i>He's confused.</i>

209
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:59,300
There was a 10cm-wide hole
on the window here, but I've taped it up.

210
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,094
I'm fixing the electrical system now.

211
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:10,144
So? Where's Mr. Han right now?

212
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,562
How much longer must we wait?

213
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,815
He's on his way now.

214
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:16,567
You rascal.

215
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:19,362
If this is a joke, I'm going to kill you.

216
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:22,031
Give me that.

217
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:26,661
His nonsense is getting out of hand.
What? "The plane is falling"?

218
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:27,912
You rascal.

219
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:32,558
BREAKING NEWS: AIR KOREANA JH007
STALLING OVER SEOUL, OUT OF CONTACT

220
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,502
Hey, Tae-sul.

221
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,005
Are you lying to me
after seeing this on the news?

222
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:41,217
Seriously?

223
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:49,684
<i>Look. Isn't this cool?</i>

224
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:52,145
<i>Hey.</i>

225
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,731
You're out of your mind.

226
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:58,901
Contact Air Koreana now!

227
00:22:58,985 --> 00:22:59,986
Right now!

228
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:02,071
Hey, Seung-bok.

229
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:04,449
Start recording what I say.

230
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:06,617
<i>Record this call!</i>

231
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:09,287
Why should I record it?

232
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,663
Just do it! Are you ready?

233
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,043
Yes, ready. Speak.

234
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:17,837
I, Han Tae-sul,

235
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:21,507
will liquidate all my savings, stocks,
certificates of deposit,

236
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:24,218
and real estate properties
except for the penthouse

237
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:27,805
and donate half of it
to a foundation which I'll set up.

238
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:29,265
Come up with a name for it.

239
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:32,477
<i>The other half will be put toward
the company's R&D funds.</i>

240
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,437
And my stock options

241
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,522
will be transferred
to every Quantum & Time employee,

242
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:39,150
<i>excluding the executives.</i>

243
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:41,652
What in the world are you talking about?

244
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:43,321
My last words, Seung-bok.

245
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:44,739
You can have the penthouse.

246
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:46,115
Are you crazy?

247
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:49,619
Do you want more?
Take my Lamborghini and Porsche too.

248
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:53,289
And give my Maybach,
Range Rover, and 63 AMG

249
00:23:53,372 --> 00:23:55,166
to my bodyguard, Yeo Bong-seon.

250
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,251
<i>Tell him I appreciate his hard work.</i>

251
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,046
That's it.
The plane will crash in 50 seconds.

252
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:02,381
Stop recording.
Did you hit the stop button?

253
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:06,677
I did.

254
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,472
Hey, this is just between you and me.

255
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:11,516
<i>I won't say it twice, so listen carefully.</i>

256
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:15,645
The password for the safe in
my dressing room at the penthouse. 1-0-0…

257
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:20,066
It's 100811.

258
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,443
August 11? The day we got listed?

259
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,029
Destroy all the research documents inside.

260
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:28,199
And there's something I have to tell you.

261
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:32,078
Remember your girlfriend
back in university? What was her name?

262
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,497
The mean one? Yu-ri.

263
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,498
Right, Yu-ri!

264
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,542
I'm the one who went to Wolmido with her.

265
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:41,546
I was reminded of her
because this feels like the Apollo Disco.

266
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:44,715
I'm sorry, buddy.
I wish you all the best, idiot!

267
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:51,639
Han Tae-sul, you…

268
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,480
<i>Breaking news.</i>

269
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,650

-<i>Fire Services has been dispatched…</i>

274

-<i>…in case the plane crashes.</i>
-On that plane?

-<i>The aircraft's location…</i>
-What?

276
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:20,459
-<i>…is currently being monitored.</i>
-Why is he running late?

00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:24,380
-<i>The CEO of Quantum & Time, Han Tae-sul…</i>
-Nonsense!

278
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:27,341
-<i>…is one of the confirmed passengers.</i>
-What?

279
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:48,154
Time's up.

280
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:50,197
Let's get ready.

281
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:10,134
You'll die without any safety equipment.

282
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:12,595
Really?

283
00:26:13,596 --> 00:26:15,014
Then I can see you again.

284
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,060
The plane will crash!

285
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:02,395
No.

286
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,647

Go to our PR team's office

Hey, Bong-seon.

319
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,364
You must be disappointed.

320
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:34,950
My Maybach and Range Rover

321
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,535
No, sir.

00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:38,454
No?

323
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:41,248
You fool.

Lee Hae-na, a first grader
from Nakmin Elementary School,

00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,343
wants to marry me when she grows up.

328
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:54,887
What do I say in my reply?

329
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,139
How about this?

330
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:01,644
"Dear Hae-na.
By the time you can get married,

331
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:05,147
my telomeres would be so short

332
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,400
that my cells probably
wouldn't be able to divide anymore.

333
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:12,029
So I suggest you find
someone with healthier cells."

334
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,907
-Come again?
-You don't get it?

335
00:31:15,783 --> 00:31:17,034
Then how about this?

336
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:19,495
"Dear Hae-na. By then,

337
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:22,289
I'll start receiving my pension."

338
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,042
Good one, right?

339
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:33,175
Why did you turn it off?

340
00:31:35,136 --> 00:31:36,178
What's wrong?

341
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:39,849
You punk, you're sulking again.

342
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,017
Is this because of the Wolmido incident?

343
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,561
I shouldn't have told you.

344
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,356
I didn't even hold her hand. Trust me.

345
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:59,243
"Board Resolution.

What is this?

348
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,126
It was approved when you were dead.

349
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:09,753
When I was dead?

350
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:11,547
I said you were declared brain-dead.

351
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:16,260
Hey, I was just getting some rest
because I was exhausted

352
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:18,470
after saving 261 precious lives,

353
00:32:18,554 --> 00:32:21,056
and the board tried to oust
the founder of the company?

354
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,684
This is why I begged you
to attend the board meetings.

355
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:26,729
Why do you keep causing trouble?

356
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,355
What trouble did I cause?

357
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:31,775
Did the plane crash because of me?

358
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:33,194
Why did you go to Saipan?

359
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:35,404
-To get some air.
-Without a word?

360
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:36,697
Why do I have to tell you?

361
00:32:44,705 --> 00:32:47,666
Risperidone, amisulpride,
diazepam, zolpidem.

362
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,210
I'm not an idiot.

363
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,670
You drug addict, listen to me.

364
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:53,756
Things are different now.
The company has grown.

365
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,424
Be more responsible!

366
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:58,552
The livelihoods of 100,000 people
depend on you,

367
00:32:58,636 --> 00:33:00,638
so stop taking those pills
and get therapy.

368
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:02,848
What if I don't?

369
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,184
Tae-san's dead.

370
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,103
You bastard.

371
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:10,022
It's been hard for me too.

372
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,608
I know you and Tae-san were close.
That day--

373
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,818
Hey, shut up and get lost.

374
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:16,779
Stop taking pills and get therapy.

375
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,614
If not, I can't help you anymore.

376
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:22,534
Han Tae-sul,
can you please snap out of it?

377
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:24,370
You weren't like this.

378
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:25,788
I was always like this.

379
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:28,916
You can act all messed up,
but I know you're better than this.

380
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:31,168
You risked your life
to save all those people.

381
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:32,836
Not everyone can do that.

382
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,171
Are you kidding me?

383
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:36,382
I don't care if they died or not.

384
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:38,968
All I did was fix what was broken.

385
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,761
That's all. Who cares?

386
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,240
It's been a month
since the accident took place.

387
00:34:01,323 --> 00:34:02,533
How have you been?

388
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:05,286
Pretty okay.

389
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:08,998
Do you have trouble sleeping
or get flashbacks of the accident?

390
00:34:09,665 --> 00:34:10,666
No, I don't.

391
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,335
How much sleep did you get last night?

392
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:16,213
I didn't sleep last night.

393
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:18,424
-Why not?
-I couldn't fall asleep.

394
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:20,926
Seo-jin.

395
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:24,680
Stop interrogating me
and just prescribe me some pills.

396
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:32,730
I can't just give you
a prescription anymore.

397
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,357
The company wants your counseling reports.

398
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:38,527
"The company"?

399
00:34:39,612 --> 00:34:41,739
I think you're forgetting something here.

400
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:43,907
I'm the CEO of that company.

401
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:45,618
Mr. CEO,

402
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:48,746
you have to stay for the full session

403
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,831
for me to write this report.

404
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,166
"Report"?

405
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:53,751
Hold on.

406
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,628
Does that mean you're spying on me?

407
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,381
Please sit down, Mr. CEO.

408
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,717
I want us to be clear
about this one thing.

409
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:05,304
You dumped me. Right?

410
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:09,975
You secretly went to the Maldives
with that sexy idol singer.

411
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:11,393
That's why I dumped you.

412
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,103
Precisely.

413
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:21,987
Do you still see things?

414
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:23,155
Nope.

415
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:27,159
Promise me you'll prescribe me
those pills if I cooperate.

416
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:30,537
Tell me about your brother.

417
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:35,209
Your relationship with him
and how you felt about him.

418
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:40,464
I don't remember.

419
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:44,259
I heard the two of you
didn't exactly get along

420
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,512
before he passed away.

421
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:48,180
You guys had a big fight.

422
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:50,641
What happened?

423
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:53,560
Nothing happened. Let's stop here.

424
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:55,062
Just give me those pills.

425
00:35:55,646 --> 00:35:57,189
They're only a temporary fix.

426
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:01,193
What was the last encounter
with your brother like?

427
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:04,321
Do you…

428
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:06,990
regret what happened that day?

429
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:14,873
<i>Tae-sul!</i>

430
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:17,710
<i>Tae-sul!</i>

431
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:26,051
CONGRATULATIONS
QUANTUM & TIME LISTED ON NASDAQ

432
00:36:26,135 --> 00:36:27,553
Your hard work has paid off.

433
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:30,431
You just need to get rich now.

434
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:34,810
Congratulations.

435
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:37,771
Tae-sul!

436
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:41,150
Tae-sul!

437
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:44,778
Tae-sul!

438
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:48,532
I'll make it quick. Tae-sul!

439
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:50,325
-Hold on.
-You can't go in.

440
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,536
Tae-sul!

441
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:55,330
I'm his brother.

442
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:58,041
Just a second. I'm his brother.

443
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,877
Don't we look alike?

444
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:02,004
-Hold on.
-You can't go in.

445
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:02,921
Let go of me.

446
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,674
I told you that I'm Tae-sul's brother.

447
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:07,801
It's okay. I'm sorry.

448
00:37:09,553 --> 00:37:11,054
-Tae-sul.
-What is it?

449
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:13,307
Sorry. It's an emergency.

450
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:18,187
I saw them.

451
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,938
Remember what I told you?

452
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:21,523
-Tae-san.
-I'm serious.

453
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,734
They were holding a suitcase--

454
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:25,819
Did you drink again?

455
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:30,115
A little. But that's not why
I'm telling you this.

456
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,950
Tae-sul. The director needs you.

457
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:33,952
Tae-san. How are you?

458
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:35,537
I'll be right in.

459
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,545
Stop rambling and go home.
I'll call you later.

460
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,672
-This is an important--
-This is important too.

461
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:46,965
It concerns you as well.

462
00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:49,718
We're not the only ones in this world.

463
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:53,096
People who aren't from this world
are living among us.

464
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,097
Even now!

465
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:55,891
They're hiding somewhere, watching us.

466
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,226
Tae-san, please.

467
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:58,602
Enough of this crazy talk!

468
00:37:58,685 --> 00:38:02,064
Listen to me. They're looking for you.

469
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:04,525
-Why are you doing this?
-Believe me, please.

470
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:06,610
They're looking for you.
They'll keep coming.

471
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:08,403
Who's coming? And from where?

472
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,947
That's not important. Remember--

473
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,658
All right, let's hear a few words
from Mr. Han Tae-sul,

474
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:14,785
who we're all so proud of.

475
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:16,161
Mr. Han.

476
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,080
Mr. Han?

477
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,248
Did you hear that?

478
00:38:20,249 --> 00:38:23,085
My company got listed today
and we secured some investments.

479
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:25,420
-Tae-sul--
-You're a shareholder too.

480
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:30,884
Take this. I'll call you tomorrow.
Let's talk then.

481
00:38:30,968 --> 00:38:33,846
-Come on. Take it.
-This isn't about money, you know.

482
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:36,056
It won't take long.
Just spare me five minutes.

483
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:39,142
I know you went through a lot,
but must I put up with this forever?

484
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:41,937
-I'm just--
-I'll repay you for everything, so--

485
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,940
No. I'm just so worried about you.
What if something happens--

486
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,651
Tae-san! If you really care about me,

487
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,778
drop this and just go home.

488
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:56,868
-Hey, let's step out for a moment.
-Seriously, enough!

489
00:38:56,952 --> 00:38:58,745
-I'll explain outside.
-I'll call you!

490
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:01,665
-No, our phones are tapped!
-For God's sake!

491
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:15,971
Jeez.

492
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,141
Tae-sul.

493
00:39:21,435 --> 00:39:23,979
Wait, Tae-sul. Tae-sul!

494
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:26,857
Tae-sul.

495
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:28,859
-Mr. Han.
-Tae-sul.

496
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:30,277
<i>Say a few words.</i>

497
00:39:48,295 --> 00:39:50,714
<i>Thank you. I'm truly grateful.</i>

498
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:54,676
<i>I couldn't have made it this far</i>

499
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:58,347
<i>without the help I received
from so many people.</i>

500
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:03,393
<i>And I'd like to personally thank
one person in particular,</i>

501
00:40:04,478 --> 00:40:07,022
<i>the chairman of the board,
who's right next to me.</i>

502
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,398
<i>Please give him a big hand.</i>

503
00:40:39,388 --> 00:40:40,597
Are you all right?

504
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,433
Yes, I'm fine.

505
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:17,718
<i>Got the counseling report. Well done.</i>

506
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:19,845
<i>Make sure you attend
the remaining sessions.</i>

507
00:41:19,928 --> 00:41:22,597
<i>I expect to see you
at the management meeting tomorrow.</i>

508
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:54,004
Who in the world is that?

509
00:41:56,173 --> 00:41:57,382
Are you insane?

510
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,594
What's wrong with you?

511
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:03,263
Come with me.

512
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:05,640
Come on, you punk!

513
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:07,517
Bong-seon! Wait a second.

514
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:14,191
Let go of him. I think I know him.

515
00:42:16,443 --> 00:42:17,277
Are you all right?

516
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,115
The plane will crash!

517
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,495
It's you.

518
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,371
The copilot on that flight.

519
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,875
What happened? Who did this to you?

520
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:34,836
The Control Bureau.

521
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:37,881
Are you

522
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,801
on their side?

523
00:42:43,136 --> 00:42:43,970
What?

524
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:47,599
That was not a bird.

525
00:42:49,351 --> 00:42:50,268
I saw it.

526
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:52,062
What exactly did you see?

527
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:00,237
The suitcase.

528
00:43:00,987 --> 00:43:01,905
What?

529
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:49,202
<i>We're experiencing some turbulence
at the moment.</i>

530
00:43:49,703 --> 00:43:53,582
<i>Please return to your seats
and keep your seat belts fastened.</i>

531
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:58,420
What's that?

532
00:44:10,432 --> 00:44:11,808
A suitcase?

533
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:27,365
What is that?

534
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,327
Is that a man?

535
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:48,720
Tae-san.

536
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:52,390
Tae-san!

537
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,919
You punk. There should be more.

538
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,382
You're not blind, right?
Then take a good look.

539
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:27,300
Can't you see? 30,000 won is missing.

540
00:45:27,384 --> 00:45:29,844
-I didn't take it.
-You little rat.

541
00:45:30,887 --> 00:45:32,347
Don't hit me, please.

542
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,349
Shut your mouth, you little thief.

543
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:37,102
I didn't steal it.
You collected all the cash yourself.

544
00:45:37,185 --> 00:45:39,938
-I know nothing about it.
-Jeez, this punk.

545
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:41,648
I really know nothing about it.

546
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,195
You little…

547
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:52,701
Hey.

548
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:55,787
Tidy up everything before you leave, okay?

549
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:03,044
GOOD FORTUNE

550
00:46:16,391 --> 00:46:17,517
It's not 30,000 won.

551
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:19,894
It's 50,000 won.

552
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:27,027
Come on. Money doesn't grow on trees.

553
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,696
I'm struggling to pay my rent here
and pay off my debt.

554
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:33,533
I told you that I'll send it.

555
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:36,828
Jeez. Okay, got it.

556
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:39,247
How's Go-eun?

557
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:41,791
Again?

558
00:46:43,752 --> 00:46:44,669
Okay.

559
00:46:45,462 --> 00:46:47,047
Yes! I said okay.

560
00:46:48,214 --> 00:46:50,967
I'm doing fine here,
so just worry about yourself.

561
00:46:53,094 --> 00:46:54,637
Yes, bye.

562
00:46:58,725 --> 00:47:02,604
Damn, I'll never get out of this hellhole.

563
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,655
Those damn stray cats.

564
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,206
You scared me.

565
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,917
What are you doing?

566
00:47:26,294 --> 00:47:27,879
Can't you speak Korean?

567
00:47:31,257 --> 00:47:32,592
Are you Chinese?

568
00:47:34,469 --> 00:47:35,845
Are you Japanese?

569
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,236
Please don't kill me.

570
00:47:56,825 --> 00:47:57,826
Food.

571
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:07,252
-<i>Police.</i>
-Are you the police?

572
00:48:07,335 --> 00:48:10,380
A suspicious-looking woman
just came to this restaurant I work at.

573
00:48:10,964 --> 00:48:13,091
<i>Please calm down and give us more details.</i>

574
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:15,802
She speaks Korean,
so I don't think she's a foreigner.

575
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:18,096
But she's a bit weird.

576
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:20,765
<i>Give us more details
of what she looks like.</i>

577
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,644
I think she's wearing pajamas.

578
00:48:24,727 --> 00:48:28,565
And no shoes. She showed up
with a suitcase and nothing else.

579
00:48:28,648 --> 00:48:29,816
And she's…

580
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:34,279
No way.

581
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,801
-<i>The 911th draw generated…</i>
-Keep eating.

582
00:48:56,885 --> 00:48:58,845
-<i>…sales of 89.3 billion won.</i>
-I'm just going to watch this.

583
00:48:58,928 --> 00:49:01,431
<i>The total prize was 21.1 billion won.</i>

584
00:49:01,514 --> 00:49:02,932
<i>There were ten winners in total,</i>

585
00:49:03,016 --> 00:49:05,768
<i>and each winner received 2.11 billion won.</i>

586
00:49:07,187 --> 00:49:09,814
<i>In 2020, Lollo accumulated</i>

587
00:49:09,898 --> 00:49:11,733
<i>809.4 billion won in total.</i>

588
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:13,026
<i>Congratulations, everyone.</i>

589
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,488
I envy those lucky rascals.

590
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:22,243
<i>The draw has begun.
The first lucky number is five!</i>

591
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:30,126
<i>Let's find out the second lucky number.</i>

592
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,086
<i>The second number is 21.</i>

593
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:38,301
<i>Let's check the third lucky number now.</i>

594
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,178
Twenty-two.

595
00:49:42,555 --> 00:49:44,015
<i>It's the number right after 21.</i>

596
00:49:44,098 --> 00:49:45,308
<i>Number 22.</i>

597
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:48,102
-<i>The machine is still running.</i>
-Eight?

598
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:50,230
<i>Now, I wonder
what the fourth number will be.</i>

599
00:49:50,897 --> 00:49:52,774
<i>The next number is eight.</i>

600
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:00,448
-Is this from last week?
-<i>Now…</i>

601
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:02,659
<i>We'll unveil the fifth lucky number.</i>

602
00:50:02,742 --> 00:50:05,036
-<i>What will it be?</i>
-It's 18.

603
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,081
<i>It is 18.</i>

604
00:50:12,502 --> 00:50:15,630
<i>Now, let's find out the sixth number.</i>

605
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:18,007
THE 912TH DRAW

606
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:24,889
Is it 38?

607
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:28,309
<i>It's 38.</i>

608
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:32,313
<i>Now, we'll draw the bonus ball
for our second prize.</i>

609
00:50:39,195 --> 00:50:40,029
Ten?

610
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:44,867
It's ten.

611
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,578
<i>The 912th draw…</i>

612
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:50,957
-How did you know?
-<i>CEO Han Tae-sul…</i>

613
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,002
<i>who had been in critical condition
since the plane crash last month,</i>

614
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:57,672
<i>miraculously regained consciousness
and was discharged today at 12 o'clock.</i>

615
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:00,675
<i>He took the world by storm
with the launch of Q20.</i>

616
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:03,428
-<i>But the company's ambition…</i>
-How did you guess those numbers?

617
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:04,846
<i>…now faces a crisis.</i>

618
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,222
-Han Tae-sul.
-<i>Quantum & Time is…</i>

619
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:08,224
<i>going to hold a conference this August.</i>

620
00:51:08,308 --> 00:51:10,226
<i>It is unclear
whether CEO Han will attend or not.</i>

621
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,978
<i>But sources say that he will…</i>

622
00:51:21,696 --> 00:51:22,739
What was that?

623
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:27,076
What?

624
00:51:32,832 --> 00:51:33,958
Where did she go?

625
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,675
What in the world is going on?

626
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:18,711
You're up.

627
00:52:24,592 --> 00:52:26,010
My suitcase.

628
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:27,387
Look, it's right there.

629
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:28,114
You suddenly passed out.

630
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:34,620
Here. I believe
you enjoyed this yesterday.

631
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:37,165
Peel it before you eat it.

632
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,791
It tastes even better.

633
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:40,626
Here.

634
00:53:53,222 --> 00:53:54,849
What were you doing?

635
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:56,684
Running away?

636
00:54:05,193 --> 00:54:06,652
Is there anything else you need?

637
00:54:08,362 --> 00:54:09,739
If not…

638
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:11,949
Can you have a look at this?

639
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:20,416
Han Tae-sul.

640
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,334
What?

641
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:25,963
Han Tae-sul of Quantum & Time. Call him.

642
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:50,738
-Sir.
-What?

643
00:54:54,867 --> 00:54:55,868
Here it is.

644
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:10,591
Thanks. Did they hand it over right away?

645
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:13,511
Yes, they handed it over
as soon as I said you asked for it.

646
00:55:13,594 --> 00:55:15,012
Tell them I said thanks.

647
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,515
But they did ask why you needed it.

648
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,727
I was just curious.

649
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,105
That's what I told them.

650
00:55:25,314 --> 00:55:27,400
-Good job. Go home.
-I'll get going, then.

651
00:55:27,483 --> 00:55:28,568
Bye.

652
00:55:37,451 --> 00:55:40,538
12 MILES TOWARD GYEONGSANGNAM-DO
16,525 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL

653
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:34,342
Gimpo.

654
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,304
Sir!

655
00:56:45,186 --> 00:56:46,729
Sir, where are you going?

656
00:56:48,648 --> 00:56:49,607
Bird-watching.

657
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:51,192
But, sir,

658
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:53,611
the VP asked me to make sure
you attend the meeting.

659
00:56:54,195 --> 00:56:57,448
Hey, have you ever been in a plane crash?

660
00:56:57,531 --> 00:56:59,158
It's extremely traumatizing.

661
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:02,119
It's hard for me
to even be around people now.

662
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,206
Even my doctor said
I need some alone time.

663
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:06,123
You know?

664
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:08,751
-I do know, but--
-See you later.

665
00:57:10,336 --> 00:57:11,796
Grab a bite or something.

666
00:57:11,879 --> 00:57:13,923
All right. Have a safe trip.

667
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:03,407
SEUNG-BOK

668
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:09,080
THE MEETING'S STARTED. WHERE ARE YOU?

669
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:20,049
<i>Do you regret what happened that day?</i>

670
00:59:20,132 --> 00:59:23,010
Enough. Just give me those pills.
How many times must I ask you?

671
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:26,639
You're just trying to avoid it,
but it won't help you in any way.

672
00:59:27,848 --> 00:59:30,893
I'm saying this because
I'm worried about you as your friend.

673
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:33,145
You'll ruin yourself.

674
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:39,860
I'm sure your brother
wouldn't want to see you doing this.

675
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:42,863
Please.

676
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:45,658
Relax and open up
when you're here at least.

677
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:46,742
"Regret"?

678
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,120
Do I regret it?

679
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,334
I do.

680
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:58,003
Since that day,

681
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:02,633
there hasn't been a single day
that I didn't think about it.

682
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:05,719
When I'm eating, taking a shower,

683
01:00:06,387 --> 01:00:09,056
<i>when I'm driving
or even lying in bed at night,</i>

684
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,808
<i>it pops into my head.</i>

685
01:00:13,602 --> 01:00:15,312
He died on the spot.

686
01:00:15,396 --> 01:00:18,691
The body was quite damaged,
so you might not recognize him.

687
01:00:46,635 --> 01:00:49,388
-Tae-san.
-He had this backpack with him.

688
01:00:50,264 --> 01:00:52,099
Is this your brother's?

689
01:01:46,987 --> 01:01:51,033
KIMCHI <i>RAMYEON</i>

690
01:02:27,987 --> 01:02:29,989
<i>I shouldn't have been so harsh that day.</i>

691
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:32,825
<i>I shouldn't have kicked him out.</i>

692
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:37,371
<i>I should've at least
given him a warm send-off.</i>

693
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:38,998
<i>I should've called him right away.</i>

694
01:02:40,374 --> 01:02:42,001
<i>I should have said,</i>

695
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:45,504
"He's my brother,"
proudly in front of everyone.

696
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,716
That's what I should have done.

697
01:02:50,384 --> 01:02:53,637
I laugh and chat with strangers
as if they're my best friends,

698
01:02:53,721 --> 01:02:55,264
but as for my brother,

699
01:02:56,598 --> 01:02:58,517
I never even had a chance to thank him.

700
01:03:00,561 --> 01:03:02,730
Had I known that would be the last time…

701
01:03:04,398 --> 01:03:05,607
If I knew…

702
01:03:10,946 --> 01:03:12,406
I'd do anything

703
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:15,659
to go back to that day, even just once.

704
01:03:16,577 --> 01:03:19,580
But I can't.
I know that it can't be undone.

705
01:03:21,582 --> 01:03:22,875
I just…

706
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:26,503
I just wish he could come back.

707
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:29,715
That's all. I miss my brother.

708
01:03:30,674 --> 01:03:32,801
I miss him like crazy.

709
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:35,888
What do you expect me to do?

710
01:03:36,597 --> 01:03:37,723
Just get over it

711
01:03:38,265 --> 01:03:39,516
and move on?

712
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,393
It's easier said than done.

713
01:03:42,061 --> 01:03:43,645
How's that even possible?

714
01:03:45,814 --> 01:03:47,441
So, please…

715
01:03:48,984 --> 01:03:52,780
Just prescribe me those pills.
Help me, Seo-jin.

716
01:03:53,989 --> 01:03:55,699
This pain is killing me inside.

717
01:04:16,261 --> 01:04:18,097
<i>We love our customers!</i>

718
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,142
<i>This is customer service agent Lee Eun-ji
at Quantum & Time.</i>

719
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:23,644
You can talk now.

720
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,647
I need to speak to Han Tae-sul.
It's urgent.

721
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:30,943
<i>Ma'am, do you mean you have
a complaint to bring to our attention?</i>

722
01:04:31,026 --> 01:04:33,112
No, I need to speak
to Han Tae-sul directly.

723
01:04:33,195 --> 01:04:34,780
<i>I understand, ma'am.</i>

724
01:04:34,863 --> 01:04:38,659
<i>However, I cannot transfer this call
to our CEO at the moment.</i>

725
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:42,412
<i>I'll transfer you to the customer service
so you can leave your feedback.</i>

726
01:04:44,373 --> 01:04:47,126
<i>Hello, this is Han Tae-sul
of Quantum & Time.</i>

727
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,169
Han Tae-sul?

728
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:54,716
<i>Quantum & Time is always waiting
for our customers' precious feedback.</i>

729
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,220
Listen to me carefully.
There are people who are watching you.

730
01:04:58,303 --> 01:05:01,181
<i>Whether it's a suggestion or a complaint,</i>

731
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:05,144
<i>we're here to listen to everything
you have to say.</i>

732
01:05:05,227 --> 01:05:07,187
<i>Please leave your message after the beep.</i>

733
01:05:08,147 --> 01:05:09,773
They're coming to get you.

734
01:05:09,857 --> 01:05:11,483
Run. If you're caught, you'll die.

735
01:05:12,317 --> 01:05:14,486
They're a lot scarier than you think.

736
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,404
Don't

737
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:17,239
trust anyone.

738
01:06:13,086 --> 01:06:15,506
REPORTER KIM GYU-HYEON

739
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:21,053
Hello, Mr. Kim.

740
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:25,224
I'll tell you the details in person.

741
01:06:26,558 --> 01:06:27,726
No.

742
01:06:28,602 --> 01:06:30,395
I haven't told the company yet.

743
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:33,649
Right, by that intersection.

744
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:35,651
I know where it is.

745
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:39,238
Then I'll see you later.

746
01:06:55,128 --> 01:06:57,130
DO NOT OPEN THE SUITCASE!.
(CALL HAN TAE-SUL!) TAKE IT AND RUN?

747
01:06:59,758 --> 01:07:01,051
The suitcase.

748
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,221
Do not open the suitcase.

749
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,947
<i>Don't open it.
If you do, we're all doomed.</i>

750
01:07:23,448 --> 01:07:25,075
Just wait for me.

751
01:07:25,158 --> 01:07:27,411
We'll meet soon,
so do whatever it takes to--

752
01:07:27,494 --> 01:07:30,372
<i>All right. Thank you very much
for your feedback.</i>

753
01:07:30,455 --> 01:07:33,208
<i>Your words of encouragement
and constructive feedback</i>

754
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:36,712
<i>are always immensely helpful
to all of us at Quantum & Time.</i>

755
01:07:36,795 --> 01:07:39,381
<i>We hope you have an excellent day.</i>

756
01:07:39,464 --> 01:07:40,882
<i>We love all our customers.</i>

757
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:44,428
Han Tae-sul?

758
01:07:45,345 --> 01:07:46,179
Han Tae-sul.

759
01:08:24,426 --> 01:08:26,303
Hey, can you smile a little?

760
01:08:29,139 --> 01:08:30,182
Are you that excited?

761
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:34,561
How did you prepare all this?
It must have cost a lot.

762
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:37,356
Thank me later.
Repay me for the rest of your life.

763
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,524
Okay, I will.

764
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:53,163
What's the password?

765
01:08:53,246 --> 01:08:55,791
-Your birthday.
-Why, of all things?

766
01:08:55,874 --> 01:08:57,709
All of my passwords are your birthday.

767
01:10:04,651 --> 01:10:07,863
<i>Tae-san. Was that really you?</i>

768
01:10:46,818 --> 01:10:50,614
-<i>This is impossible.</i>
-<i>What's with all these photographs?</i>

769
01:10:50,697 --> 01:10:53,241
-Did you get married?
-I don't even know this woman.

770
01:10:53,325 --> 01:10:55,202
You married someone you don't even know?

771
01:10:55,786 --> 01:10:57,871
Who are you? Are you a ghost?

772
01:10:57,954 --> 01:10:59,956
Please spare me. Just this once!

773
01:11:02,334 --> 01:11:03,460
It's the Control Bureau.

774
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:05,045
What?

775
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:07,380
<i>-We have to go.
-Go where?</i>

776
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:08,924
They'll kill you since you were with me.

777
01:11:09,007 --> 01:11:09,966
I'm not going.

778
01:11:10,592 --> 01:11:11,718
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

779
01:11:11,802 --> 01:11:13,553
<i>Illegal immigrants running around
in broad daylight?</i>

780
01:11:14,054 --> 01:11:15,305
I'm not going to die today.

781
01:11:15,388 --> 01:11:16,515
<i>Did you bring it?</i>

782
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:18,892
<i>Then you should've called me.</i>

783
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,812
-I'm from the Immigration Office.
-Who are you guys?

784
01:11:21,895 --> 01:11:23,313
What's important

785
01:11:23,396 --> 01:11:24,898
<i>isn't "where."</i>

786
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:27,484
-Who are those guys?
-The Control Bureau.

787
01:11:28,235 --> 01:11:29,945
<i>Those guys are ruthless.</i>

788
01:11:30,028 --> 01:11:33,824
<i>Once they catch you,
you'll never get back home alive.</i>

789
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:37,828
If you want to know what's going on,
just do as I tell you.

790
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:39,329
Come with us.

791
01:11:40,038 --> 01:11:40,872
"Run."

792
01:11:40,956 --> 01:11:43,583
Let me go. Let go of me, you punks!

793
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,922
