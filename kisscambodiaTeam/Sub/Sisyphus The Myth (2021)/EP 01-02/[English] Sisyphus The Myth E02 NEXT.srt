00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,604
WOOHYUNG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

3
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,330
What was this?

4
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:25,979
HAN TAE-SAN

5
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,365
HAN TAE-SAN

6
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,870
Tae-san…

7
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,040
HAN TAE-SAN

8
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,172
-What is it?
-I can't do this.

9
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,799
-What's wrong?
-I dropped this last time.

10
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,093
The film keeps getting stuck now.

11
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:01,014
I told you to just get a digital camera.
Nobody uses film cameras these days.

12
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,434
No way. Decent digital cameras
would cost as much as a car.

13
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,768
And didn't I tell you?

14
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,397
Digital cameras don't have that warmth.

15
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,607
How should I put it?

16
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,193
It lacks the human touch.
It's about humanity, you know?

17
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,071
Hello? Anybody in there?
That's a machine too, you know.

18
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,365
My gosh.

19
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,118
All right.

20
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,916
All right, it's done.

21
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,376
Okay.

22
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,267
Yes! Tae-san! Look, it's working!

23
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,353
-It's working!
-What? It's working?

24
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,272
-Yes!
-Oh, yes!

25
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,108
Yes! Let's get a digital camera now!

26
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,904
<i>It's really working, right?</i>

27
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,996
Was that really you, Tae-san?

28
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,243
100 MISSED CALLS
JANUARY 22, TUESDAY

29
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,332
UNKNOWN CALLER

30
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,209
What?

31
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,724
<i>Mr. Han Tae-san.</i>

32
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,021
<i>Mr. Han!</i>

33
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,814
Yes?

34
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,817
<i>Why weren't you picking up your calls?</i>

35
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,902
<i>You heard about me, right?
It's me, Mr. Park.</i>

36
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,573
Well, the phone was off.

37
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,116
<i>Did you arrive okay?</i>

38
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,160
Pardon?

39
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,828
<i>Did you arrive okay?</i>

40
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,371
Oh, yes.

41
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,082
Then you should've called me.

42
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,794
Where did you fall, then?

43
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,633
Well, the reed field in Gimpo.

44
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,052
<i>Goodness.</i>

45
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,763
<i>That must've been pretty rough.</i>

46
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,931
<i>There have been download errors
these days.</i>

47
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,684
<i>Everyone keeps falling over there.</i>

48
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,352
You're not injured or anything?

49
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,606
Oh, and what about the Control Bureau?

50
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,359
Oh, it's all right.

51
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,195
<i>That's a relief.</i>

52
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,822
<i>So, did you bring it?</i>

53
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,494
Well, yes. I did bring the stuff,

54
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,205
but what exactly do you mean?

55
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,918
<i>I guess it's natural to forget.
I mean the key!</i>

56
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,295
<i>Did you bring the key?</i>

57
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,505
The key?

58
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,216
Yes, I have the key.

59
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,134
<i>Are your limbs all there?</i>

60
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,969
What?

61
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,680
<i>Are your limbs all intact?</i>

62
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,432
Yes.

63
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,644
Good. Your health is the most important.

64
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,271
All right. Let's meet.

65
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,190
Bring the key.

66
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,609
Where should I go?

67
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,403
<i>No, it's fine. We'll come pick you up.</i>

68
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,696
<i>Where are you now?</i>

69
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,991
I'm at an acquaintance's house.

70
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,537
<i>An acquaintance?</i>

71
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,415
<i>You said your limbs are all intact, right?</i>

72
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,667
Yes.

73
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,502
<i>But let me ask you something.</i>

74
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,587
What's the number

75
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,132
written on your right arm?

76
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,268
Hey. You're not Han Tae-san, are you?

77
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,566
What was that?

78
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,573
<i>The number you have dialed cannot…</i>

79
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,824
Damn it.

80
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:51,215
SISYPHUS

81
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,064
SEUNG-BOK

82
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,984
Damn it.

83
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,907
-Hello?
-<i>Why weren't you picking up?</i>

84
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,117
I'm on my way.

85
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,454
Oh, right. The meeting. It's over, right?

86
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,832
<i>I'm sorry about that.
I'll make sure to attend next time.</i>

87
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,669
Hello? Seung-bok?

88
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,631
You're angry at me again.

89
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,966
Why do you always get angry at me?

90
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,136
Just come home right now.

91
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,847
What's going on? You're scaring me.

92
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,516
Hello?

93
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,875
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

94
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,852
Who are all these people?

95
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,479
The security alarm went off.

96
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,273
What about the security camera?

97
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,734
Nobody was caught on camera.
I don't know what happened.

98
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,373
Has any of your belongings gone missing?

99
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,504
I'm not sure.

100
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,880
Look carefully.

101
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,508
It looks like the culprit
made a huge mess.

102
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,220
-No, it's just the way it was when I left.
-Pardon?

103
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,849
Well, it may look messy,
but it's actually pretty organized.

104
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,018
-So it was like this…
-Hang on.

105
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,978
Something's different.

106
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,404
It's fine now.

107
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:21,412
It seems like a simple
breaking and entering case.

108
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,707
Did you see anyone suspicious
when you left the house?

109
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,631
The drawing.

110
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,342
It was always like that.

111
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,552
No, I hung it upside down on purpose.

112
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,179
Mr. Kim, take that down.

113
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,990
"Don't look for your brother.

114
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,659
If you do,

115
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,952
you'll die"?

116
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,996
What?

117
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,980
This is crazy. How did they get in?

118
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,111
I've requested officers to be placed here
and got all the guards to come.

119
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,655
I'm canceling all your schedules for now.

120
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,203
But by "brother," did they mean Tae-san?

121
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,082
What did they mean by not looking
for your brother?

122
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,042
I have no idea.

123
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,045
Hey, this isn't something
you can just forget about.

124
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,423
Stop saying you don't know
and think about it.

125
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,343
Have you done anything weird recently?

126
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,860
<i>Mr. Han Tae-san.</i>

127
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,988
<i>Did you bring it?</i>

128
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,573
<i>Did you bring the key?</i>

129
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:33,210
Strange. I'm sure I saw it before,
but I can't remember where.

130
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,050
It's not here.

131
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,052
Is this it?

132
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,764
This must be it.

133
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,060
Why is that locked up?

134
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,606
Is this it?

135
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,577
I give up.

136
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:24,929
What?

137
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,313
Mr. Han, I'm going home now.

138
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,898
Not now! Come over here.

139
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,733
Come on.

140
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,485
Hurry!

141
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,530
Oh, gosh.

142
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,323
-Darn it.
-Where to?

143
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,204
What is this?

144
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,502
-Over here. Put it here.
-On the floor?

145
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,586
Put it down.

146
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,308
-What are you doing?
-I'm making a darkroom.

147
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,228
Bong-seon, there's a red safelight
in the storage room.

148
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,521
Go and bring it for me.

149
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,279
-And get a cup of coffee on the way back.
-Okay.

150
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,114
-Iced coffee.
-Okay.

151
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,340
What's with all these photographs?

152
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,385
Did you take them when
you were birdwatching?

153
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,553
Yes.

154
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,060
They're not birds.

155
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,979
They're not.

156
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,607
Could it be a stalker?

157
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,902
Maybe.

158
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,616
Hey.

159
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,078
Who's that?

160
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,915
My brother.

161
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,795
Didn't your brother…

162
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,880
He died.

163
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,843
They look like photos that were taken
after he died. What is all this?

164
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,845
This is impossible.

165
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,722
-What is it?
-Hey.

166
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,350
-What?
-The date…

167
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,143
It's today.

168
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,436
What?

169
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,358
What about this?

170
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,819
This is crazy.

171
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,238
The conference. It's in two days.

172
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,451
No way.

173
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,333
Did you get married?

174
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,876
What are you talking about?

175
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,509
Hey, I don't even know this woman.

176
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,929
You married someone you don't even know?

177
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,932
Shut up.
I don't know what's going on, either.

178
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,018
What is all this?

179
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,867
Seo-hae.

180
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,380
Damn it.

181
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,683
Is it the girl or the world?

182
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,727
You can only choose one.

183
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,025
No.

184
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,295
<i>Don't breathe.</i>

185
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,380
<i>Everything is poison.</i>

186
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,431
I only took it off for a while
to tie my hair.

187
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,974
What about you, dad?

188
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,684
I'm fine.

189
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,457
SEYANGWON

190
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,139
That damn thief.
If I catch you, you're dead.

191
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,814
Darn it.

192
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,942
Where did it go?

193
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,366
It must be tough working in the heat.

194
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,117
Was there a burglary or something?

195
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,578
Yes. But we're not open yet.

196
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,372
We're open at 11.

197
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,706
I'm not here to eat.

198
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,005
What is it, then?

199
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,715
I'm from the Immigration Office.

200
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,675
HWANG HYUN-SEUNG

201
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,177
We don't have any illegal immigrants
working here.

202
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,097
I got caught for hiring one last time,

203
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,723
so I almost had to close the shop.

204
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,060
Now I never hire anyone who seems
the slightest bit suspicious.

205
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,562
It's not about that. We received a report.

206
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,948
<i>It's the police, right?
Some strange woman entered our restaurant.</i>

207
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,575
<i>Please calm down,
and tell us exactly what's going on.</i>

208
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,495
<i>She doesn't seem to be a foreigner.
She speaks Korean.</i>

209
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,289
<i>But something smells fishy.</i>

210
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,250
That's Sun's voice.

211
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,962
That lousy jerk.
I knew he'd cause trouble.

212
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,089
The man who made that call
works here, right?

213
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,591
Yes, he works in our kitchen.
But he isn't here yet.

214
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,510
His name is Sun? Is he a foreigner?

215
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,638
No, not at all. He's absolutely Korean.

216
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,932
I just call him that.
It's like a nickname.

217
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,602
His name is Choi Jae-sun.
He's not an illegal immigrant.

218
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,438
Did he do something wrong?

219
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,898
It won't cause us any trouble, right?

220
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,692
Could we take a look around inside?

221
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,195
Well, you should at least tell me
what this is about.

222
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,697
Check this place.

223
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,537
What are you doing?

224
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,421
We have signs of contact.

225
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,425
Where were you last night?

226
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,385
I was at home.

227
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,472
Are there any other security cameras
besides that?

228
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,307
No, that's the only one.

229
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,559
Were you with friends or family
last night?

230
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,395
No, I live alone.

231
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,397
This will get complicated.

232
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,233
Complicated? What do you mean?

233
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:44,154
Anyone who's come into contact
with them has to be quarantined.

234
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,450
Who are you guys? You're not
from the Immigration Office, are you?

235
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,286
Where are you from?

236
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,372
Sir, what's important

237
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,708
isn't "where."

238
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,088
Take care of him.

239
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:29,074
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

240
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,788
I told you I don't have any.

241
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,542
I'll wire you some when I get paid!

242
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,047
I don't have a single penny
on me right now.

243
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,551
I'm hanging up.

244
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,765
This…

245
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,560
Damn it!

246
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,604
Hey! Do you have a girl
living in your house?

247
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,439
No.

248
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,568
Don't lie to me!
Then who's that girl over there?

249
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,363
Damn it.

250
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,532
Why is she out there when she's sick?

251
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,201
You have to pay extra
if you have a roommate!

252
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,953
Don't try to fool me!

253
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,372
Hey! Kid!

254
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,875
Darn it.

255
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,547
You shouldn't be out here
when you're sick.

256
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,591
You're here.

257
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,009
Let's go.

258
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,845
-That bag…
-I got it from your closet.

259
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,888
Let me borrow this.

260
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,099
Gosh, that's expensive.

261
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,852
-But where are you going?
-Busan.

262
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,645
Like that? Why?

263
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,357
If Han Tae-sul opened the suitcase,
they're going to kill him.

264
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,068
-Who?
-You don't have to come.

265
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,111
Just get me a ticket.

266
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,364
No way. You have to pay me first.

267
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,660
You said you'll give me the numbers
if I made the call.

268
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,370
I never said I would.

269
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,496
What?

270
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,501
Hey. I let you stay the night
and even fed you.

271
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,462
Plus, you're taking my bag.

272
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,922
That's worth a lot.

273
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:11,593
I didn't report you,
even if you seemed a bit strange.

274
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,552
And you do this?

275
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,348
I could just report you.

276
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,309
Give me back my bag.

277
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,566
Oh, sorry.

278
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,110
I'm really sorry.

279
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,365
I said I'm sorry.

280
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,287
What?

281
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,831
Who are you?

282
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,250
Are you a ghost?

283
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,004
You're a ghost, right?
Please spare me. Just this once!

284
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,304
I have an elderly mother
and a younger sibling.

285
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,515
My family will starve to death without me.

286
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,892
Please don't kill me.

287
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,812
Please, have mercy.

288
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,239
I'll tell you the rest
when we're in Busan.

289
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,326
Why would I go there?

290
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,036
I told you,

291
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,039
if Han Tae-sul opened the suitcase,
they'll kill him.

292
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,711
What does that have to do with me?

293
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,504
Are you coming or not?

294
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,301
Darn it.

295
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,561
Give me that.

296
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,738
I need clothes.

297
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,452
It's the only female clothing I have.

298
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,956
It's our restaurant uniform.
I don't know why it's here, though.

299
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,542
You wear that.

300
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,461
What?

301
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,590
Don't be ridiculous.

302
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,426
No way. This is a luxury brand.

303
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,969
It cost me a fortune.

304
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,734
Darn it.

305
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,862
This jacket's expensive.

306
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,369
That too.

307
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,586
-And your pants.
-What?

308
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,964
Gosh.

309
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,829
She's so annoying.

310
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,389
Let's go.

311
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,942
Right now?

312
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:56,860
Yes.

313
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,988
Hang on.

314
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,199
I need to call my boss first.

315
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,535
You can't get to Busan that quickly,
you know.

316
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,747
Hang on. I need to take the day off.

317
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,762
Why isn't he picking up?

318
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,150
Why isn't he answering?

319
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,737
Is he still not at the restaurant?

320
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,364
He's never this late.
Hang on one more minute.

321
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,616
Let me call once more.

322
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,338
Those kids? They're in there.

323
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,134
It's the Control Bureau.

324
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,928
What?

325
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,521
Put on your silencers.
There are eyes watching.

326
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,486
What?

327
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,961
Don't pull out your guns
in a cramped place like this.

328
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,508
Come on out!

329
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,293
That's enough.

330
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,213
Let's not do this. Come on out.

331
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,718
-We have to go.
-Go where?

332
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,977
Over there? No way.

333
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,979
They'll kill you since you were with me.

334
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,022
I'm not going.

335
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,775
They're not on the other side.

336
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,526
You can go by yourself.

337
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,280
Wait! Don't shoot! I didn't do anything!

338
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,532
I really didn't do anything.

339
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,494
-Please just let me go.
-Run!

340
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,757
Get up!

341
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,214
Bravo!

342
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,091
Unbelievable.

343
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,927
Illegal immigrants running around
in broad daylight?

344
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,937
Are you that desperate to die?

345
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,650
All right, then.

346
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,415
I'm not going to die today.

347
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,810
They're on a dump truck.
License plate, 92…

348
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,895
No need.

349
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,647
They can't last long without a broker.

350
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,735
Okay. We got a call from headquarters.

351
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,944
They found something.

352
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,990
<i>Han Tae-sul. Don't open the suitcase.</i>

353
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,075
Han Tae-sul? The Han Tae-sul?

354
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,786
Yes. The CEO of Quantum & Time.

355
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,538
She called with that man's phone.

356
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,053
Is Grandpa in there?

357
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:09,018
DECEASED, HAN TAE-SAN

358
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,286
Oh, the ashes got switched.

359
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,443
It must be tough for you.
I hope your loved one can rest in peace.

360
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,701
What a weirdo.

361
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,625
Gosh. You startled me.

362
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,253
What's this? A DNA test?

363
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,881
Wait. Damn it.

364
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,425
It's a paternity test.

365
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,555
I told you not to go outside.

366
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,433
Sorry, I forgot.
I'm going to go back home.

367
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,227
But why are you two always together?

368
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,146
What's going on?

369
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,024
Are you two dating?

370
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,068
Are you?

371
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,944
You guys…

372
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,488
Are you really…

373
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,282
I was just kidding, but I guess it's true.

374
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,831
It says there's a 99.9 percent chance
of not being a match.

375
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,167
Lucky you.

376
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:49,011
You two look great together. You did it!

377
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,304
Congratulations.

378
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,409
But…

379
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,247
is it really possible for someone
to fall from the sky?

380
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,125
I'm not sure
if it's scientifically possible.

381
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,044
I don't know, either.

382
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,880
Then what now? Should I take you home?

383
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,966
I guess.

384
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,054
By the way, how did they
get inside your house?

385
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,516
The house is technically impenetrable.
It's built like a safe.

386
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,602
-How did they get the door open?
-A safe…

387
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,064
You're a genius!

388
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:47,069
Hey! Go to Jeongan-myeon 21-2,
Paju, Gyeonggi Province.

389
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,073
I just remembered what that key is!
It's for a safe!

390
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,869
How did you even think of that?

391
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,121
You're so adorable.

392
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,845
Bong-seon.

393
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,531
Wait here, Bong-seon.

394
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,532
What is this place?

395
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,117
This place?

396
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,996
It's my first lab my brother built for me.

397
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,129
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

398
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,039
Come on.

399
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,294
It was around here somewhere.

400
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,851
Who took this?

401
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,582
WHAT MODEL PLANE DID HE RIDE?

402
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,585
FUND MANAGER KIM DONG-HYEON

403
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,420
YOO EUN-JI NAMED DEPUTY PRESIDENT

404
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,466
HAN TAE-SUL DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL

405
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,102
HAN TAE-SUL
QUANTUM & TIME CEO

406
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,104
What is this?

407
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,524
What took you so long?

408
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,674
What is all this?

409
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,098
This is the key to the safe, right?

410
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,849
Where's the safe?

411
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,313
Why did you deceive me?

412
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,984
Why did you pretend you were dead?

413
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,696
How…

414
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,700
How could you do this to me?

415
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,203
Answer your phone.

416
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,796
-Hello?
-<i>Mr. Han Tae-sul?</i>

417
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,259
<i>Are you the famous Han Tae-sul?</i>

418
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:24,263
You should've told me. It's an honor.

419
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:29,893
<i>The safe was really heavy.</i>

420
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:31,812
Who are you?

421
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,482
<i>You have the key, right?</i>

422
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,819
Who are you?

423
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,362
Come on, don't shout.

424
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:44,283
Shouting won't get you anywhere.

425
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,536
<i>We should meet
and talk it out heart-to-heart.</i>

426
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,914
What happened to my brother?

427
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,210
<i>Let's take our time to talk.</i>

428
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,756
<i>You have the key, and I have the safe.</i>

429
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,676
<i>It takes two to tango, you know.</i>

430
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,095
<i>We should meet up and talk.</i>

431
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:10,684
And it seems everything inside
will be destroyed if you force it open.

432
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,897
<i>That's pretty smart.</i>

433
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,817
How do you know my brother?

434
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,735
Your brother?

435
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,989
Well, we're business partners.

436
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,949
Just tell me one thing.

437
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,368
Was my brother alive all this time?

438
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,162
Of course!

439
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,247
-Why?
-<i>"Why?"</i>

440
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,335
<i>My gosh. He's alive because he isn't dead!</i>

441
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,963
What about the plane crash?
How did that happen?

442
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,008
<i>You said you were going to ask one thing.
Question time is over.</i>

443
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,470
All we need is that key.

444
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:50,057
We'll come find you,
so take care of yourself until then,

445
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,392
and keep that key safe.

446
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,479
Since we're making a deal,

447
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:59,358
let me offer you something as an extra.

448
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:03,362
Take a look outside.

449
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,833
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

450
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,858
You see men in black uniforms, right?

451
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:53,829
Hey, Bong-seon.

452
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:57,207
Sir, some strange people
are heading that way.

453
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,668
Yes, I know. Hang on, don't hang up.

454
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:00,877
Okay.

455
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,298
Who are those guys?

456
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,049
The Control Bureau.

457
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,469
<i>The Control Bureau.</i>

458
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,097
Are you

459
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,058
on their side?

460
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,478
<i>Those guys are ruthless.</i>

461
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,774
Once they catch you,
you'll never get back home alive.

462
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,486
If you want to know what's going on,
just do as I tell you.

463
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:32,284
I'll tell you what I tell all my clients.

464
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,830
"Run."

465
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,390
Darn it.

466
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,935
-Bong-seon.
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

467
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,229
Get the car started.

468
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,558
Move in. We're going to capture him alive.

469
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,519
Go.

470
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,429
Darn it.

471
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,973
-Bong-seon!
-Yes, sir!

472
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,408
Bong-seon.

473
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,452
Bong-seon!

474
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,339
Bong-seon, let's go. Bong-seon!

475
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,725
You'll lose your breath
if you keep running like that.

476
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,143
Come with us.

477
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,230
Bong-seon.

478
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,845
<i>Forty-eight kilometers
until your destination.</i>

479
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,222
Turn that off.

480
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,059
Sorry, sir.

481
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,291
IMMIGRATION CONTROL BUREAU

482
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,835
"Immigration Control Bureau"?

483
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:56,715
Aren't you going a bit overboard
with immigrant management?

484
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,844
They're dangerous.

485
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:21,239
IMMIGRATION CONTROL BUREAU

486
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,049
NO SIGNAL

487
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,468
Damn it.

488
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,665
Pardon us for what we did to you.

489
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,292
I can't get a signal.

490
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,753
-It's for security purposes.
-What is this place?

491
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,879
The Immigration Office?

492
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,257
No, we've become a bureau since last year.

493
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,093
We're the Immigration Control Bureau,
Team 7.

494
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,054
Excuse us for a moment.

495
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,815
What are you doing?

496
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,072
Have you met this woman before?

497
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,540
No. Who is that?

498
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,128
Where is the suitcase?

499
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,426
Let me ask you again.

500
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,470
Where is the suitcase?

501
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,890
Who are you guys?

502
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,768
I told you
that we're the Immigration Control Bureau.

503
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,188
Managing immigrants coming from where?
What does that have to do with me?

504
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,440
Mr. Han, the important thing

505
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,609
isn't where they come from.

506
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:15,038
We don't want to harm you, Mr. Han.

507
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,625
Normally, we should've
taken care of you already,

508
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,252
but because of your social status…

509
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,381
You know what government business is like.

510
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,801
Please cooperate.

511
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,095
I'll ask you one last time.
Where's the suitcase?

512
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,263
I don't know.

513
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,432
All right.

514
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,352
You seem to be quite a playboy.

515
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:41,272
It's best to stay out of trouble
in these unsettling times,

516
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,565
don't you think?

517
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,984
There will be a "Me Too" article
released tomorrow.

518
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:46,820
What?

519
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,364
I guess your stock prices will drop
about ten percent.

520
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:53,618
And for the day after tomorrow…
Yes, this will be nice.

521
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,078
Retinol, diazepam…

522
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,498
Habitual use
of illegal psychotropic drugs.

523
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,667
If there's an article
about the CEO Han Tae-san

524
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,794
being a drug addict,

525
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,004
you'll have to give up your position.

526
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,548
Shall we meet again after that?

527
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,678
If you sit in that chair
after you become a normal citizen,

528
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,806
you won't be able to say things
so confidently like

529
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,058
"I don't know, I don't remember" again.

530
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:19,936
Whatever you want.

531
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:23,940
Everyone starts out as confident as you.

532
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,234
But they all act the same eventually.

533
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:29,112
They say "Please let me live,
I'll tell you everything.

534
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,989
Please just kill me."

535
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,327
Like your brother, Han Tae-san.

536
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,458
What did you just say?

537
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,793
Say that again!

538
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,337
Take him home.

539
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,424
You jerks! Come over here!

540
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:50,967
Mr. Han!

541
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,264
We're keeping an eye on you.
Watch your back.

542
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,184
Let me go. Let go of me, you punks!

543
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,324
Mr. Han!

544
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,118
Are you okay?

545
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,833
Mr. Han, are you sure you're okay?

546
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,418
I think you should get some rest.

547
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,869
After I regained consciousness,

548
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,497
I got a call from them.

549
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,209
They said you'll be out in a few hours.

550
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,253
They told me not to call anyone

551
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,963
and to wait for you at your house.

552
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,340
Then I found you unconscious
at the front door.

553
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,510
Who were those guys, though?

554
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,679
The Control Bureau.

555
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,139
Controlling what?

556
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,017
I don't know, either.
They wouldn't tell me.

557
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,315
I think you should really stay home
from now on.

558
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,858
That threat you received,

559
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,112
-and what happened yesterday…
-Let's go.

560
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,863
Where?

561
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,367
Busan.

562
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,880
Two tickets to Busan, please.

563
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,884
The 10:30 KTX Train arrives the earliest.

564
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,554
-How much is it?
-It's 119,600 won for two tickets.

565
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,765
Gosh. What about a Mugunghwa Train?

566
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,101
There's one that leaves at 10:20.

567
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,062
-How much is that one?
-It's 57,200 won.

568
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,482
I'll get two tickets for that.

569
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,736
If you're using your card,
insert it in the device here.

570
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,446
No, I'm paying with cash.

571
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,950
Here's 56,000 won, and…

572
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,628
Here. 1,200 won.

573
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,515
Two executive car seats
for a KTX Train to Busan.

574
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,429
What happened, Tae-san?

575
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,483
Bong-seon.

576
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,070
Do you think I've lost my mind?

577
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,906
I'm not sure.

578
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,951
I just…

579
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,123
miss my brother.

580
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,500
That's all.

581
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,921
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

582
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,550
-If they come to the conference…
-What if they do?

583
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,760
Maybe they're the ones

584
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,596
who wrote that on the wall.
The Control Bureau or something.

585
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,015
-No, they're not.
-How would you know that?

586
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,810
If they wanted to kill me,
they'd have done it yesterday.

587
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,522
-Then who…
-How would I know?

588
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,818
By the way, you're riding a train
instead of a plane…

589
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,530
Would you want to ride a plane
after a plane accident?

590
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:28,995
Gosh, those thieves. They always try
to make you buy the expensive ones.

591
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,509
Isn't it funny?

592
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,304
Look at the screen over there.

593
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:51,225
The KTX Train leaves ten minutes later
than the Mugunghwa Train,

594
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,935
but it arrives three hours earlier.

595
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,480
Doesn't that resemble our lives?

596
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,649
People who have wealthy parents
get to ride KTX Trains

597
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,693
and arrive earlier than other guys

598
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,612
even when they leave later than them.

599
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,240
Life is so unfair.

600
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,664
What? Is that blood?

601
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,084
Yes.

602
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,883
But who were those guys?

603
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,093
They said they were the Control Bureau.

604
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:28,679
Are you an illegal immigrant?

605
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,224
None of your business.

606
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,267
-Hey.
-What?

607
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,438
Who were they? They even had guns!

608
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,398
The Control Bureau.

609
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:43,152
What kind of government bureau
carries guns around like that?

610
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,738
My gosh. I almost died, you know.

611
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,408
I can't die. I told you.

612
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,869
I'm the breadwinner of my family.

613
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,247
If you don't tell me the lottery number…

614
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,501
I can't even go home,
and my boss isn't picking up my calls.

615
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,796
I don't even have money for the trip back.

616
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,800
-Just report me.
-What?

617
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,344
Jeez. What do you take me for?

618
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:20,147
But why are you looking for Han Tae-sul?
Do you know him?

619
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,775
Or is there money involved?

620
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,111
Or is it a love affair?

621
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,244
Is he really going to die?

622
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:36,205
Is he an illegal immigrant too?
Or is he in the Control Bureau?

623
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,165
-No.
-Then what?

624
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,884
I'm going to the bathroom.

625
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,448
What?

626
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,159
What the…

627
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,293
Damn it.

628
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,142
Hey! Are you in here?

629
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,531
Damn it.

630
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,038
Hey!

631
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:10,211
Damn it!

632
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,100
Damn it.

633
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,681
<i>Hasn't this ever happened to you?</i>

634
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:07,518
<i>Seeing a photo of something
that hasn't happened yet, for example.</i>

635
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,770
The future is already here.

636
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:13,023
<i>It's just not widely in use yet.</i>

637
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:16,569
<i>The company decided not to give in
to the kidnapper's demands.</i>

638
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,446
<i>But how, when Tae-sul is still missing?</i>

639
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,073
We still have you.

640
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,741
<i>We need to make a move now.</i>

641
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,618
You almost had us killed!

642
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,287
Who put you up to this?

643
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,956
Are you stalking me?
Is this like a one-night stand?

644
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,291
As if.

645
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,419
I'm the owner of Asia Mart.

646
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:38,507
<i>What we do here is…
We're like the unofficial embassy.</i>

647
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:44,180
<i>We take care of people who came here
from other places.</i>

648
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,557
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

649
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,936
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>
