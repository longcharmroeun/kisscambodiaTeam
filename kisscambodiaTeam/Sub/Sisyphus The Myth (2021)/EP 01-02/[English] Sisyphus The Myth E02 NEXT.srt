WOOHYUNG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

3
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,431
What was this?

4
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:39,118
HAN TAE-SAN

5
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,466
HAN TAE-SAN

6
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,970
Tae-san…

7
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:59,188
HAN TAE-SAN

8
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,272
-What is it?
-I can't do this.

9
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,900
-What's wrong?
-I dropped this last time.

10
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:10,194
The film keeps getting stuck now.

11
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:14,114
I told you to just get a digital camera.
Nobody uses film cameras these days.

12
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:17,534
No way. Decent digital cameras
would cost as much as a car.

13
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:18,869
And didn't I tell you?

14
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:22,498
Digital cameras don't have that warmth.

15
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:23,707
How should I put it?

16
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,294
It lacks the human touch.
It's about humanity, you know?

17
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:30,172
Hello? Anybody in there?
That's a machine too, you know.

18
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:32,466
My gosh.

19
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,219
All right.

20
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:41,016
All right, it's done.

21
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,477
Okay.

22
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:59,368
Yes! Tae-san! Look, it's working!

23
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:01,453
-It's working!
-What? It's working?

24
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:07,209
Yes! Let's get a digital camera now!

25
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:11,004
<i>It's really working, right?</i>

26
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:20,097
Was that really you, Tae-san?

27
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:58,343
100 MISSED CALLS
JANUARY 22, TUESDAY

28
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:04,456
UNKNOWN CALLER

29
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:06,310
What?

30
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:20,824
<i>Mr. Han Tae-san.</i>

31
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:26,121
<i>Mr. Han!</i>

32
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:27,914
Yes?

33
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:30,918
<i>Why weren't you picking up your calls?</i>

34
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,003
<i>You heard about me, right?
It's me, Mr. Park.</i>

35
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:36,673
Well, the phone was off.

36
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,216
<i>Did you arrive okay?</i>

37
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:40,260
Pardon?

38
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:41,928
<i>Did you arrive okay?</i>

39
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:43,472
Oh, yes.

40
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,183
Then you should've called me.

41
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:49,895
Where did you fall, then?

42
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:55,734
Well, the reed field in Gimpo.

43
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:57,152
<i>Goodness.</i>

44
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:59,863
<i>That must've been pretty rough.</i>

45
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,032
<i>There have been download errors
these days.</i>

46
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,785
<i>Everyone keeps falling over there.</i>

47
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:06,453
You're not injured or anything?

48
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:09,706
Oh, and what about the Control Bureau?

49
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,460
Oh, it's all right.

50
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:15,295
<i>That's a relief.</i>

51
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,923
<i>So, did you bring it?</i>

52
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:22,594
Well, yes. I did bring the stuff,

53
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:25,305
but what exactly do you mean?

54
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:30,018
<i>I guess it's natural to forget.
I mean the key!</i>

55
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:32,396
<i>Did you bring the key?</i>

56
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,605
The key?

57
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:36,316
Yes, I have the key.

58
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,235
<i>Are your limbs all there?</i>

59
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:40,070
What?

60
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,781
<i>Are your limbs all intact?</i>

61
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:44,533
Yes.

62
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:47,744
Good. Your health is the most important.

63
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:50,372
All right. Let's meet.

64
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,290
Bring the key.

65
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,710
Where should I go?

66
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:57,504
<i>No, it's fine. We'll come pick you up.</i>

67
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:58,797
<i>Where are you now?</i>

68
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:02,092
I'm at an acquaintance's house.

69
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:05,637
<i>An acquaintance?</i>

70
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:09,516
<i>You said your limbs are all intact, right?</i>

71
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,767
Yes.

72
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,602
<i>But let me ask you something.</i>

73
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,688
What's the number

74
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,232
written on your right arm?

75
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:28,368
Hey. You're not Han Tae-san, are you?

76
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:34,666
What was that?

77
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:41,673
<i>The number you have dialed cannot…</i>

78
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:42,924
Damn it.

79
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:15,165
SEUNG-BOK

80
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,084
Damn it.

81
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:24,007
-Hello?
-<i>Why weren't you picking up?</i>

82
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:26,218
I'm on my way.

83
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:29,554
Oh, right. The meeting. It's over, right?

84
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:32,933
<i>I'm sorry about that.
I'll make sure to attend next time.</i>

85
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:36,770
Hello? Seung-bok?

86
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,731
You're angry at me again.

87
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:42,067
Why do you always get angry at me?

88
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,237
Just come home right now.

89
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:47,948
What's going on? You're scaring me.

90
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:49,616
Hello?

91
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:15,976
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

92
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:34,953
Who are all these people?

93
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,580
The security alarm went off.

94
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:38,373
What about the security camera?

95
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:41,835
Nobody was caught on camera.
I don't know what happened.

96
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,473
Has any of your belongings gone missing?

97
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:01,605
I'm not sure.

98
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:02,981
Look carefully.

99
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:05,609
It looks like the culprit
made a huge mess.

100
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:09,321
-No, it's just the way it was when I left.
-Pardon?

101
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:12,949
Well, it may look messy,
but it's actually pretty organized.

102
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,118
-So it was like this…
-Hang on.

103
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,078
Something's different.

104
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:26,504
It's fine now.

105
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:34,512
It seems like a simple
breaking and entering case.

106
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:37,807
Did you see anyone suspicious
when you left the house?

107
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,731
The drawing.

108
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,442
It was always like that.

109
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,653
No, I hung it upside down on purpose.

110
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,279
Mr. Kim, take that down.

111
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,091
"Don't look for your brother.

112
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:12,759
If you do,

113
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:15,053
you'll die"?

114
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,097
What?

115
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:43,081
This is crazy. How did they get in?

116
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:48,211
I've requested officers to be placed here
and got all the guards to come.

117
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:50,755
I'm canceling all your schedules for now.

118
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,303
But by "brother," did they mean Tae-san?

119
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:01,182
What did they mean by not looking
for your brother?

120
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,143
I have no idea.

121
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:06,146
Hey, this isn't something
you can just forget about.

122
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:08,523
Stop saying you don't know
and think about it.

123
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:12,444
Have you done anything weird recently?

124
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,960
<i>Mr. Han Tae-san.</i>

125
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:32,088
<i>Did you bring it?</i>

126
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,673
<i>Did you bring the key?</i>

127
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:46,311
Strange. I'm sure I saw it before,
but I can't remember where.

128
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,151
It's not here.

129
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,153
Is this it?

130
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:58,865
This must be it.

131
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:03,161
Why is that locked up?

132
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:06,706
Is this it?

133
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:19,677
I give up.

134
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:38,029
What?

135
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,413
Mr. Han, I'm going home now.

136
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:48,998
Not now! Come over here.

137
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:50,834
Come on.

138
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:52,585
Hurry!

139
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:55,630
Oh, gosh.

140
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:57,423
-Darn it.
-Where to?

141
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,304
What is this?

142
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,602
-Over here. Put it here.
-On the floor?

143
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:10,687
Put it down.

144
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:24,409
-What are you doing?
-I'm making a darkroom.

145
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:27,328
Bong-seon, there's a red safelight
in the storage room.

146
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:28,621
Go and bring it for me.

147
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:36,379
-And get a cup of coffee on the way back.
-Okay.

148
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:38,214
-Iced coffee.
-Okay.

149
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,441
What's with all these photographs?

150
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,486
Did you take them when
you were birdwatching?

151
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:00,653
Yes.

152
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,161
They're not birds.

153
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:10,079
They're not.

154
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:12,707
Could it be a stalker?

155
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,002
Maybe.

156
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:21,716
Hey.

157
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,179
Who's that?

158
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,015
My brother.

159
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:34,896
Didn't your brother…

160
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:35,980
He died.

161
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:40,944
They look like photos that were taken
after he died. What is all this?

162
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:42,946
This is impossible.

163
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:44,822
-What is it?
-Hey.

164
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,450
-What?
-The date…

165
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:49,244
It's today.

166
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:50,536
What?

167
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:55,458
What about this?

168
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,920
This is crazy.

169
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:01,339
The conference. It's in two days.

170
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,552
No way.

171
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:12,433
Did you get married?

172
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:13,977
What are you talking about?

173
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:21,609
Hey, I don't even know this woman.

174
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:25,029
You married someone you don't even know?

175
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:28,032
Shut up.
I don't know what's going on, either.

176
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,119
What is all this?

177
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,968
Seo-hae.

178
00:15:58,521 --> 00:15:59,480
Damn it.

179
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:10,783
Is it the girl or the world?

180
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:12,827
You can only choose one.

181
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,125
No.

182
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:44,395
<i>Don't breathe.</i>

183
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,481
<i>Everything is poison.</i>

184
00:18:52,904 --> 00:18:55,531
I only took it off for a while
to tie my hair.

185
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,074
What about you, dad?

186
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:58,784
I'm fine.

187
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:21,557
SEYANGWON

188
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:37,240
That damn thief.
If I catch you, you're dead.

189
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,915
Darn it.

190
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,042
Where did it go?

191
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,466
It must be tough working in the heat.

192
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,218
Was there a burglary or something?

193
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,679
Yes. But we're not open yet.

194
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:01,472
We're open at 11.

195
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:02,807
I'm not here to eat.

196
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:10,106
What is it, then?

197
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:11,816
I'm from the Immigration Office.

198
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:12,775
HWANG HYUN-SEUNG

199
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:15,278
We don't have any illegal immigrants
working here.

200
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:18,197
I got caught for hiring one last time,

201
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:19,824
so I almost had to close the shop.

202
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:23,160
Now I never hire anyone who seems
the slightest bit suspicious.

203
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:25,663
It's not about that. We received a report.

204
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:36,048
<i>It's the police, right?
Some strange woman entered our restaurant.</i>

205
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,676
<i>Please calm down,
and tell us exactly what's going on.</i>

206
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,596
<i>She doesn't seem to be a foreigner.
She speaks Korean.</i>

207
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,389
<i>But something smells fishy.</i>

208
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,350
That's Sun's voice.

209
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:50,062
That lousy jerk.
I knew he'd cause trouble.

210
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:52,189
The man who made that call
works here, right?

211
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:54,692
Yes, he works in our kitchen.
But he isn't here yet.

212
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,611
His name is Sun? Is he a foreigner?

213
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,739
No, not at all. He's absolutely Korean.

214
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:02,033
I just call him that.
It's like a nickname.

215
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:05,703
His name is Choi Jae-sun.
He's not an illegal immigrant.

216
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:07,538
Did he do something wrong?

217
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:09,999
It won't cause us any trouble, right?

218
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:11,792
Could we take a look around inside?

219
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:15,296
Well, you should at least tell me
what this is about.

220
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:16,797
Check this place.

221
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:23,638
What are you doing?

222
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:32,521
We have signs of contact.

223
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,525
Where were you last night?

224
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,486
I was at home.

225
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:41,572
Are there any other security cameras
besides that?

226
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:43,407
No, that's the only one.

227
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:45,660
Were you with friends or family
last night?

228
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:48,496
No, I live alone.

229
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,498
This will get complicated.

230
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:53,334
Complicated? What do you mean?

231
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:57,254
Anyone who's come into contact
with them has to be quarantined.

232
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:01,550
Who are you guys? You're not
from the Immigration Office, are you?

233
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,387
Where are you from?

234
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:07,473
Sir, what's important

235
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:09,809
isn't "where."

236
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:14,188
Take care of him.

237
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:42,174
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

238
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:47,888
I told you I don't have any.

239
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:51,642
I'll wire you some when I get paid!

240
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:57,148
I don't have a single penny
on me right now.

241
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:00,651
I'm hanging up.

242
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:06,866
This…

243
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:09,660
Damn it!

244
00:23:09,744 --> 00:23:12,705
Hey! Do you have a girl
living in your house?

245
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:14,540
No.

246
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:17,668
Don't lie to me!
Then who's that girl over there?

247
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:21,464
Damn it.

248
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,632
Why is she out there when she's sick?

249
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,302
You have to pay extra
if you have a roommate!

250
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:28,053
Don't try to fool me!

251
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:30,473
Hey! Kid!

252
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:32,975
Darn it.

253
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:38,647
You shouldn't be out here
when you're sick.

254
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,691
You're here.

255
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:42,109
Let's go.

256
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:44,945
-That bag…
-I got it from your closet.

257
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,988
Let me borrow this.

258
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:49,200
Gosh, that's expensive.

259
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,952
-But where are you going?
-Busan.

260
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:53,746
Like that? Why?

261
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,458
If Han Tae-sul opened the suitcase,
they're going to kill him.

262
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,169
-Who?
-You don't have to come.

263
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:01,212
Just get me a ticket.

264
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:04,465
No way. You have to pay me first.

265
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:08,761
You said you'll give me the numbers
if I made the call.

266
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:10,471
I never said I would.

267
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:11,597
What?

268
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,602
Hey. I let you stay the night
and even fed you.

269
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:18,562
Plus, you're taking my bag.

270
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:20,022
That's worth a lot.

271
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:24,693
I didn't report you,
even if you seemed a bit strange.

272
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:25,653
And you do this?

273
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,448
I could just report you.

274
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:32,409
Give me back my bag.

275
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,667
Oh, sorry.

276
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:42,211
I'm really sorry.

277
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:46,465
I said I'm sorry.

278
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:52,388
What?

279
00:24:53,764 --> 00:24:54,932
Who are you?

280
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,350
Are you a ghost?

281
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,105
You're a ghost, right?
Please spare me. Just this once!

282
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:09,305
I have an elderly mother
and a younger sibling.

283
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,515
My family will starve to death without me.

284
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,893
Please don't kill me.

285
00:25:15,144 --> 00:25:16,812
Please, have mercy.

286
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:27,239
I'll tell you the rest
when we're in Busan.

287
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,327
Why would I go there?

288
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:33,037
I told you,

289
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,040
if Han Tae-sul opened the suitcase,
they'll kill him.

290
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,711
What does that have to do with me?

291
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:42,505
Are you coming or not?

292
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:47,301
Darn it.

293
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:57,561
Give me that.

294
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:07,738
I need clothes.

295
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:13,452
It's the only female clothing I have.

296
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:17,957
It's our restaurant uniform.
I don't know why it's here, though.

297
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:20,543
You wear that.

298
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:22,461
What?

299
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:26,590
Don't be ridiculous.

300
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:29,426
No way. This is a luxury brand.

301
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,970
It cost me a fortune.

302
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:45,734
Darn it.

303
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,863
This jacket's expensive.

304
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:55,369
That too.

305
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:04,587
-And your pants.
-What?

306
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:07,965
Gosh.

307
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:38,829
She's so annoying.

308
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:57,389
Let's go.

309
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:08,943
Right now?

310
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:09,860
Yes.

311
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:12,988
Hang on.

312
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:16,200
I need to call my boss first.

313
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:18,535
You can't get to Busan that quickly,
you know.

314
00:28:19,954 --> 00:28:21,747
Hang on. I need to take the day off.

315
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:36,762
Why isn't he picking up?

316
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:50,150
Why isn't he answering?

317
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:53,737
Is he still not at the restaurant?

318
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:56,365
He's never this late.
Hang on one more minute.

319
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,616
Let me call once more.

320
00:29:08,794 --> 00:29:11,338
Those kids? They're in there.

321
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:16,135
It's the Control Bureau.

322
00:29:16,927 --> 00:29:17,928
What?

323
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:27,521
Put on your silencers.
There are eyes watching.

324
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:16,487
What?

325
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,961
Don't pull out your guns
in a cramped place like this.

326
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:43,508
Come on out!

327
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:18,293
That's enough.

328
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:22,214
Let's not do this. Come on out.

329
00:33:24,424 --> 00:33:26,718
-We have to go.
-Go where?

330
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,978
Over there? No way.

331
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:37,980
They'll kill you since you were with me.

332
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:39,022
I'm not going.

333
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:41,775
They're not on the other side.

334
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,527
You can go by yourself.

335
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,281
Wait! Don't shoot! I didn't do anything!

336
00:33:47,364 --> 00:33:49,533
I really didn't do anything.

337
00:33:49,616 --> 00:33:52,494
-Please just let me go.
-Run!

338
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:05,757
Get up!

339
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:48,091
Unbelievable.

340
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:50,927
Illegal immigrants running around
in broad daylight?

341
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:00,937
Are you that desperate to die?

342
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:05,650
All right, then.

343
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:20,415
I'm not going to die today.

344
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:40,811
They're on a dump truck.
License plate, 92…

345
00:35:40,894 --> 00:35:41,895
No need.

346
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,648
They can't last long without a broker.

347
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:48,735
Okay. We got a call from headquarters.

348
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:49,945
They found something.

349
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:53,990
<i>Han Tae-sul. Don't open the suitcase.</i>

350
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:56,076
Han Tae-sul? The Han Tae-sul?

351
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:58,787
Yes. The CEO of Quantum & Time.

352
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,539
She called with that man's phone.

353
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:15,053
Is Grandpa in there?

354
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:22,018
DECEASED, HAN TAE-SAN

355
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:40,287
Oh, the ashes got switched.

356
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:12,444
It must be tough for you.
I hope your loved one can rest in peace.

357
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:19,701
What a weirdo.

358
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,626
Gosh. You startled me.

359
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:12,254
What's this? A DNA test?

360
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:14,881
Wait. Damn it.

361
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:17,425
It's a paternity test.

362
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:22,556
I told you not to go outside.

363
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,433
Sorry, I forgot.
I'm going to go back home.

364
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:28,228
But why are you two always together?

365
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,146
What's going on?

366
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:33,024
Are you two dating?

367
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:35,068
Are you?

368
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:36,945
You guys…

369
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:38,488
Are you really…

370
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:41,283
I was just kidding, but I guess it's true.

371
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,832
It says there's a 99.9 percent chance
of not being a match.

372
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:51,167
Lucky you.

373
00:38:58,008 --> 00:39:02,012
You two look great together. You did it!

374
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:03,305
Congratulations.

375
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,409
But…

376
00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:29,247
is it really possible for someone
to fall from the sky?

377
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:32,125
I'm not sure
if it's scientifically possible.

378
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:35,045
I don't know, either.

379
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:37,881
Then what now? Should I take you home?

380
00:39:38,715 --> 00:39:39,966
I guess.

381
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:45,055
By the way, how did they
get inside your house?

382
00:39:45,138 --> 00:39:48,516
The house is technically impenetrable.
It's built like a safe.

383
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,603
-How did they get the door open?
-A safe…

384
00:39:53,772 --> 00:39:55,065
You're a genius!

385
00:39:55,857 --> 00:40:00,070
Hey! Go to Jeongan-myeon 21-2,
Paju, Gyeonggi Province.

386
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:04,074
I just remembered what that key is!
It's for a safe!

387
00:40:04,908 --> 00:40:07,869
How did you even think of that?

388
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:10,121
You're so adorable.

389
00:40:24,803 --> 00:40:25,845
Bong-seon.

390
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,532
Wait here, Bong-seon.

391
00:40:45,615 --> 00:40:46,533
What is this place?

392
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,118
This place?

393
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:51,996
It's my first lab my brother built for me.

394
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,130
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

395
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:35,040
Come on.

396
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:21,294
It was around here somewhere.

397
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:36,851
Who took this?

398
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,582
WHAT MODEL PLANE DID HE RIDE?

399
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:02,585
FUND MANAGER KIM DONG-HYEON

400
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:04,420
YOO EUN-JI NAMED DEPUTY PRESIDENT

401
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:08,466
HAN TAE-SUL DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL

402
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:20,103
HAN TAE-SUL
QUANTUM & TIME CEO

403
00:43:20,937 --> 00:43:22,105
What is this?

404
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:25,525
What took you so long?

405
00:43:48,548 --> 00:43:49,674
What is all this?

406
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,098
This is the key to the safe, right?

407
00:43:57,849 --> 00:43:58,850
Where's the safe?

408
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:04,314
Why did you deceive me?

409
00:44:06,149 --> 00:44:08,985
Why did you pretend you were dead?

410
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:12,697
How…

411
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:16,701
How could you do this to me?

412
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:19,203
Answer your phone.

413
00:44:26,169 --> 00:44:28,796
-Hello?
-<i>Mr. Han Tae-sul?</i>

414
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:33,259
<i>Are you the famous Han Tae-sul?</i>

415
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:37,263
You should've told me. It's an honor.

416
00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:42,894
<i>The safe was really heavy.</i>

417
00:44:43,728 --> 00:44:44,812
Who are you?

418
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:48,483
<i>You have the key, right?</i>

419
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:51,819
Who are you?

420
00:44:51,903 --> 00:44:53,363
Come on, don't shout.

421
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:57,283
Shouting won't get you anywhere.

422
00:44:57,367 --> 00:45:00,536
<i>We should meet
and talk it out heart-to-heart.</i>

423
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,915
What happened to my brother?

424
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:08,211
<i>Let's take our time to talk.</i>

425
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:12,757
<i>You have the key, and I have the safe.</i>

426
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,677
<i>It takes two to tango, you know.</i>

427
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,096
<i>We should meet up and talk.</i>

428
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:23,685
And it seems everything inside
will be destroyed if you force it open.

429
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:27,897
<i>That's pretty smart.</i>

430
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,818
How do you know my brother?

431
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:32,735
Your brother?

432
00:45:33,444 --> 00:45:36,990
Well, we're business partners.

433
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:38,950
Just tell me one thing.

434
00:45:39,742 --> 00:45:41,369
Was my brother alive all this time?

435
00:45:41,452 --> 00:45:43,162
Of course!

436
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:45,248
-Why?
-<i>"Why?"</i>

437
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:49,335
<i>My gosh. He's alive because he isn't dead!</i>

438
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:52,964
What about the plane crash?
How did that happen?

439
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:56,009
<i>You said you were going to ask one thing.
Question time is over.</i>

440
00:45:56,592 --> 00:45:59,470
All we need is that key.

441
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:03,057
We'll come find you,
so take care of yourself until then,

442
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:05,393
and keep that key safe.

443
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:08,479
Since we're making a deal,

444
00:46:08,563 --> 00:46:12,358
let me offer you something as an extra.

445
00:46:12,442 --> 00:46:16,362
Take a look outside.

446
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:29,834
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

447
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,859
You see men in black uniforms, right?

448
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:06,829
Hey, Bong-seon.

449
00:47:06,913 --> 00:47:10,208
Sir, some strange people
are heading that way.

450
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,668
Yes, I know. Hang on, don't hang up.

451
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:13,878
Okay.

452
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:17,298
Who are those guys?

453
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:19,050
The Control Bureau.

454
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:22,470
<i>The Control Bureau.</i>

455
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:25,098
Are you

456
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:28,059
on their side?

457
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:31,479
<i>Those guys are ruthless.</i>

458
00:47:31,562 --> 00:47:35,775
Once they catch you,
you'll never get back home alive.

459
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:39,487
If you want to know what's going on,
just do as I tell you.

460
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:45,284
I'll tell you what I tell all my clients.

461
00:47:48,746 --> 00:47:49,831
"Run."

462
00:48:07,223 --> 00:48:08,391
Darn it.

463
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:11,936
-Bong-seon.
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

464
00:48:12,603 --> 00:48:14,230
Get the car started.

465
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:51,559
Move in. We're going to capture him alive.

466
00:48:52,185 --> 00:48:53,519
Go.

467
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,429
Darn it.

468
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:12,974
-Bong-seon!
-Yes, sir!

469
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:31,409
Bong-seon.

470
00:50:32,326 --> 00:50:33,452
Bong-seon!

471
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:45,339
Bong-seon, let's go. Bong-seon!

472
00:50:53,806 --> 00:50:56,726
You'll lose your breath
if you keep running like that.

473
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:58,144
Come with us.

474
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:01,230
Bong-seon.

475
00:51:30,384 --> 00:51:32,845
<i>Forty-eight kilometers
until your destination.</i>

476
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:35,222
Turn that off.

477
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:39,060
Sorry, sir.

478
00:51:59,872 --> 00:52:02,291
IMMIGRATION CONTROL BUREAU

479
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:04,835
"Immigration Control Bureau"?

480
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,715
Aren't you going a bit overboard
with immigrant management?

481
00:52:12,134 --> 00:52:13,844
They're dangerous.

482
00:52:30,736 --> 00:52:34,240
IMMIGRATION CONTROL BUREAU

483
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:34,049
NO SIGNAL

484
00:53:34,967 --> 00:53:36,469
Damn it.

485
00:54:04,663 --> 00:54:06,665
Pardon us for what we did to you.

486
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,293
I can't get a signal.

487
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:11,754
-It's for security purposes.
-What is this place?

488
00:54:11,837 --> 00:54:12,880
The Immigration Office?

489
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:15,257
No, we've become a bureau since last year.

490
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:18,093
We're the Immigration Control Bureau,
Team 7.

491
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:21,055
Excuse us for a moment.

492
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:31,815
What are you doing?

493
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:39,073
Have you met this woman before?

494
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:48,541
No. Who is that?

495
00:54:51,335 --> 00:54:53,128
Where is the suitcase?

496
00:54:57,841 --> 00:54:59,426
Let me ask you again.

497
00:55:00,094 --> 00:55:01,470
Where is the suitcase?

498
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,890
Who are you guys?

499
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:07,768
I told you
that we're the Immigration Control Bureau.

500
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:11,188
Managing immigrants coming from where?
What does that have to do with me?

501
00:55:11,272 --> 00:55:13,440
Mr. Han, the important thing

502
00:55:13,524 --> 00:55:15,609
isn't where they come from.

503
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:28,038
We don't want to harm you, Mr. Han.

504
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:31,625
Normally, we should've
taken care of you already,

505
00:55:31,709 --> 00:55:34,253
but because of your social status…

506
00:55:35,546 --> 00:55:38,382
You know what government business is like.

507
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:40,801
Please cooperate.

508
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:43,095
I'll ask you one last time.
Where's the suitcase?

509
00:55:44,138 --> 00:55:45,264
I don't know.

510
00:55:46,265 --> 00:55:47,433
All right.

511
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,352
You seem to be quite a playboy.

512
00:55:50,978 --> 00:55:54,273
It's best to stay out of trouble
in these unsettling times,

513
00:55:54,356 --> 00:55:55,566
don't you think?

514
00:55:55,649 --> 00:55:57,985
There will be a "Me Too" article
released tomorrow.

515
00:55:58,986 --> 00:55:59,820
What?

516
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:02,364
I guess your stock prices will drop
about ten percent.

517
00:56:02,448 --> 00:56:06,619
And for the day after tomorrow…
Yes, this will be nice.

518
00:56:06,702 --> 00:56:08,078
Retinol, diazepam…

519
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:11,498
Habitual use
of illegal psychotropic drugs.

520
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:13,667
If there's an article
about the CEO Han Tae-san

521
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:15,794
being a drug addict,

522
00:56:15,878 --> 00:56:18,005
you'll have to give up your position.

523
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:19,548
Shall we meet again after that?

524
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:24,678
If you sit in that chair
after you become a normal citizen,

525
00:56:24,762 --> 00:56:27,806
you won't be able to say things
so confidently like

526
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,059
"I don't know, I don't remember" again.

527
00:56:31,977 --> 00:56:32,936
Whatever you want.

528
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:36,940
Everyone starts out as confident as you.

529
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:39,234
But they all act the same eventually.

530
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:42,112
They say "Please let me live,
I'll tell you everything.

531
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,989
Please just kill me."

532
00:56:47,785 --> 00:56:49,328
Like your brother, Han Tae-san.

533
00:56:52,998 --> 00:56:54,458
What did you just say?

534
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:56,794
Say that again!

535
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,338
Take him home.

536
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:02,424
You jerks! Come over here!

537
00:57:03,008 --> 00:57:03,968
Mr. Han!

538
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:09,264
We're keeping an eye on you.
Watch your back.

539
00:57:09,348 --> 00:57:12,184
Let me go. Let go of me, you punks!

540
00:57:25,614 --> 00:57:27,324
Mr. Han!

541
00:57:28,826 --> 00:57:30,119
Are you okay?

542
00:57:33,706 --> 00:57:36,834
Mr. Han, are you sure you're okay?

543
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:38,419
I think you should get some rest.

544
00:58:10,743 --> 00:58:12,870
After I regained consciousness,

545
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:15,497
I got a call from them.

546
00:58:16,707 --> 00:58:19,209
They said you'll be out in a few hours.

547
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:21,253
They told me not to call anyone

548
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:22,963
and to wait for you at your house.

549
00:58:23,046 --> 00:58:25,340
Then I found you unconscious
at the front door.

550
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:28,510
Who were those guys, though?

551
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:30,679
The Control Bureau.

552
00:58:31,263 --> 00:58:33,140
Controlling what?

553
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:36,018
I don't know, either.
They wouldn't tell me.

554
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:42,316
I think you should really stay home
from now on.

555
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:43,859
That threat you received,

556
00:58:44,902 --> 00:58:47,112
-and what happened yesterday…
-Let's go.

557
00:58:47,738 --> 00:58:48,864
Where?

558
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:52,367
Busan.

559
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:05,881
Two tickets to Busan, please.

560
00:59:07,174 --> 00:59:09,885
The 10:30 KTX Train arrives the earliest.

561
00:59:09,968 --> 00:59:12,554
-How much is it?
-It's 119,600 won for two tickets.

562
00:59:13,138 --> 00:59:15,766
Gosh. What about a Mugunghwa Train?

563
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:18,102
There's one that leaves at 10:20.

564
00:59:18,185 --> 00:59:21,063
-How much is that one?
-It's 57,200 won.

565
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,483
I'll get two tickets for that.

566
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:27,736
If you're using your card,
insert it in the device here.

567
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,446
No, I'm paying with cash.

568
00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:33,951
Here's 56,000 won, and…

569
00:59:43,043 --> 00:59:44,628
Here. 1,200 won.

570
00:59:55,097 --> 00:59:57,516
Two executive car seats
for a KTX Train to Busan.

571
01:00:34,386 --> 01:00:36,430
What happened, Tae-san?

572
01:00:47,357 --> 01:00:48,483
Bong-seon.

573
01:00:50,569 --> 01:00:52,070
Do you think I've lost my mind?

574
01:00:53,614 --> 01:00:54,907
I'm not sure.

575
01:00:56,658 --> 01:00:57,951
I just…

576
01:01:01,496 --> 01:01:03,123
miss my brother.

577
01:01:04,124 --> 01:01:05,500
That's all.

578
01:01:08,503 --> 01:01:09,922
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

579
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:13,550
-If they come to the conference…
-What if they do?

580
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:15,761
Maybe they're the ones

581
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:18,597
who wrote that on the wall.
The Control Bureau or something.

582
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,016
-No, they're not.
-How would you know that?

583
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:23,810
If they wanted to kill me,
they'd have done it yesterday.

584
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:27,522
-Then who…
-How would I know?

585
01:01:29,149 --> 01:01:31,818
By the way, you're riding a train
instead of a plane…

586
01:01:33,028 --> 01:01:35,530
Would you want to ride a plane
after a plane accident?

587
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:41,995
Gosh, those thieves. They always try
to make you buy the expensive ones.

588
01:01:55,217 --> 01:01:56,510
Isn't it funny?

589
01:01:57,427 --> 01:01:59,304
Look at the screen over there.

590
01:01:59,888 --> 01:02:04,226
The KTX Train leaves ten minutes later
than the Mugunghwa Train,

591
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:05,936
but it arrives three hours earlier.

592
01:02:06,979 --> 01:02:08,480
Doesn't that resemble our lives?

593
01:02:09,189 --> 01:02:11,650
People who have wealthy parents
get to ride KTX Trains

594
01:02:11,733 --> 01:02:13,694
and arrive earlier than other guys

595
01:02:13,777 --> 01:02:15,612
even when they leave later than them.

596
01:02:17,823 --> 01:02:19,241
Life is so unfair.

597
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:26,665
What? Is that blood?

598
01:02:29,001 --> 01:02:30,085
Yes.

599
01:02:35,257 --> 01:02:36,883
But who were those guys?

600
01:02:37,551 --> 01:02:39,094
They said they were the Control Bureau.

601
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:41,680
Are you an illegal immigrant?

602
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:44,224
None of your business.

603
01:02:44,725 --> 01:02:46,268
-Hey.
-What?

604
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:50,439
Who were they? They even had guns!

605
01:02:51,023 --> 01:02:52,399
The Control Bureau.

606
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:56,153
What kind of government bureau
carries guns around like that?

607
01:02:56,236 --> 01:02:58,739
My gosh. I almost died, you know.

608
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:02,409
I can't die. I told you.

609
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,870
I'm the breadwinner of my family.

610
01:03:04,953 --> 01:03:07,247
If you don't tell me the lottery number…

611
01:03:08,165 --> 01:03:11,501
I can't even go home,
and my boss isn't picking up my calls.

612
01:03:12,461 --> 01:03:14,796
I don't even have money for the trip back.

613
01:03:17,049 --> 01:03:18,800
-Just report me.
-What?

614
01:03:19,509 --> 01:03:21,344
Jeez. What do you take me for?

615
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:33,148
But why are you looking for Han Tae-sul?
Do you know him?

616
01:03:33,815 --> 01:03:35,776
Or is there money involved?

617
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,111
Or is it a love affair?

618
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:46,244
Is he really going to die?

619
01:03:46,328 --> 01:03:49,206
Is he an illegal immigrant too?
Or is he in the Control Bureau?

620
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,166
-No.
-Then what?

621
01:03:59,466 --> 01:04:00,884
I'm going to the bathroom.

622
01:06:27,405 --> 01:06:28,448
What?

623
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:31,159
What the…

624
01:06:38,959 --> 01:06:40,293
Damn it.

625
01:06:53,306 --> 01:06:56,142
Hey! Are you in here?

626
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:10,532
Damn it.

627
01:07:15,745 --> 01:07:17,038
Hey!

628
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:23,211
Damn it!

629
01:07:35,307 --> 01:07:37,100
Damn it.

630
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:16,681
<i>Hasn't this ever happened to you?</i>

631
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:20,518
<i>Seeing a photo of something
that hasn't happened yet, for example.</i>

632
01:08:21,102 --> 01:08:22,771
The future is already here.

633
01:08:22,854 --> 01:08:26,024
<i>It's just not widely in use yet.</i>

634
01:08:26,107 --> 01:08:29,569
<i>The company decided not to give in
to the kidnapper's demands.</i>

635
01:08:29,652 --> 01:08:32,447
<i>But how, when Tae-sul is still missing?</i>

636
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,074
We still have you.

637
01:08:34,157 --> 01:08:35,742
<i>We need to make a move now.</i>

638
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:37,619
You almost had us killed!

639
01:08:37,702 --> 01:08:39,287
Who put you up to this?

640
01:08:39,371 --> 01:08:41,956
Are you stalking me?
Is this like a one-night stand?

641
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,291
As if.

642
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:46,419
I'm the owner of Asia Mart.

643
01:08:46,503 --> 01:08:51,508
<i>What we do here is…
We're like the unofficial embassy.</i>

644
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:57,180
<i>We take care of people who came here
from other places.</i>

645
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:59,557
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

646
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:03,937
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

647
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:07,774
