00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,978
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,249
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

3
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,251
Don't rush me. I'm coming.

4
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,670
<i>Do you even know where I am?</i>

5
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,798
You've been hovering around me
all this time.

6
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,300
What are you? My employee?

7
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,260
<i>That's right.</i>

8
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,264
<i>Hurry here and finish coding.
And that will be it.</i>

9
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,893
You stay right there.

10
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,895
This time,
let's really put an end to this.

11
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,856
<i>Will you be all right, though? You'll die.</i>

12
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,609
No, I won't go that easily.

13
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,362
<i>The nuclear bomb will go off tomorrow.</i>

14
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,532
<i>You know,
there's one thing that made me very sad.</i>

15
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,827
<i>That I couldn't witness
the amazing explosion firsthand.</i>

16
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,872
<i>Tae-sul, do you have any idea
how long I've been waiting for this day?</i>

17
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,376
Hey, Sigma. Stop, that's enough.

18
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,671
Even this time, you won't see it,
so don't get ahead of yourself.

19
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:16,010
Had I known I'd have to find you again,
I would've just shot you that day.

20
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,346
You were really fast
when running away in tears.

21
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,391
You should've become a professional runner
instead of an artist.

22
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,768
Then you probably would have
turned out all right.

23
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,772
<i>Did you just scoff? What the hell?</i>

24
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,607
<i>I'm dead serious right now.</i>

25
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,736
Some people just never make it
no matter how hard they work. That's you.

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,739
-<i>Keep babbling away.</i>
-Are you upset?

27
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,784
<i>Nothing would've happened
had you kept your mouth shut.</i>

28
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,662
You're still playing the blame game
in this situation?

29
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,331
This is why you can never make it.

30
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,125
You were like this even as a kid.

31
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,795
You tried to blame everything you did
and even your guilt on me.

32
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,882
<i>The same goes for all your hate comments.</i>

33
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,510
<i>You think you're better than others
and that everyone else is wrong.</i>

34
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,803
This nuclear war?

35
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,390
You want to say that's also my fault,
don't you?

36
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,101
What? Go on and say it.

37
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,522
Why are you all quiet? Answer my question.

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,774
-<i>You're one to talk.</i>
-Me?

39
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,902
Why? I never blame others for my mistakes.

40
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,196
-You're--
-<i>That's why people hate you, you bastard.</i>

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,489
Shut up!

42
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,826
You're changing your word now?
You told me to babble away.

43
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,621
What do you even know?

44
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,751
You people… You, Gang Seo-hae,

45
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,047
that old man who sold me the rope
and charcoal briquettes and said nothing,

46
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,300
the taxi driver who hounded me
for the fare when I was

47
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,011
running away barefoot covered in blood,
and the cops!

48
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,057
<i>I slept at the park for two nights,
freezing.</i>

49
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,436
Not a single person asked me
if I was okay.

50
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,730
<i>Not even one person.</i>

51
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:58,395
SISYPHUS

52
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,077
Taxi!

53
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,374
The police station. Go!

54
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,261
-Is that blood?
-What?

55
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,137
It is blood.

56
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,974
Hey, what happened?

57
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,643
Han Tae-sul… He barged into my place and--

58
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,895
-Did you bring your apology letter?
-He shot me.

59
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,481
I told you to write an apology letter,
not to fight.

60
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,817
-No, hear me out!
-What the heck happened?

61
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,528
-Hey! You punk!
-Han Tae-sul shot me!

62
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,990
-Han Tae-sul shot me.
-Detective, he didn't pay his fare.

63
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,658
-Hey, mister.
-You bastard!

64
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,077
He shot me!

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,456
Shut up, you prick! Stop! Enough!

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,791
Did you pay your taxi fare?

67
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,543
No. But Han Tae-sul…

68
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,338
Have you lost your mind?
Why would he shoot you?

69
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,090
That's…

70
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,427
That I don't know.

71
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,928
What a total lunatic.

72
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,682
Look, you must repent
when you've done something wrong.

73
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,435
What you're doing is defamation.
You piece of trash.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,231
I told you to write an apology letter,
not to talk such bullshit!

75
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,318
You jerk, you'd better pay me!

76
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,070
-Get your act together.
-You scumbag!

77
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,114
-Hey, snap out of it!
-You punk!

78
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,159
-What's with you?
-What's your problem?

79
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,037
-What are you doing?
-You'd better pay me!

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,164
-Hey, you punk.
-Pay your fare!

81
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,791
-Hey, stop! Get him!
-Pay me at once!

82
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,886
<i>I kept racking my brain.</i>

83
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,263
<i>To figure out</i>

84
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,434
<i>why the heck you tried to kill me.</i>

85
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,686
I thought it was unfair.

86
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,690
I didn't think I'd done anything
to deserve that.

87
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,400
You tell me, since you're smart.

88
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,030
<i>Did I do something
to deserve getting shot? Did I?</i>

89
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,866
<i>But you know,</i>

90
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:12,330
<i>it turned out
the reason didn't even matter at all.</i>

91
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,333
Because the world

92
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,295
is an unfair place to begin with.

93
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,090
-Look! Grab this.
-That's so cool.

94
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,884
<i>Even if you shoot me, I'm the bad guy.</i>

95
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,512
<i>Yes, you're right.</i>

96
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,433
<i>This world has always favored you
and hated me.</i>

97
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,604
<i>I mean, what other reason could there be?</i>

98
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,129
I will not die at your hands.

99
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,791
<i>Our country is under attack.</i>

100
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,877
<i>The highest level of
national security alert has been issued.</i>

101
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,505
<i>The Wolsong Nuclear Power Plant
was first hit,</i>

102
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,216
<i>and nuclear bombs are being dropped
all over the country.</i>

103
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,802
<i>Even the metropolitan area
has been hit by…</i>

104
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,940
<i>That's why you want to start a war?</i>

105
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,611
<i>People don't like you,
so you want to wipe them out?</i>

106
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,030
<i>Not all of them.</i>

107
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,032
<i>I survived, you know.</i>

108
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,452
<i>Because I'd sealed
all the windows shut to die,</i>

109
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,830
<i>I was protected from the nuclear fallout.</i>

110
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,781
<i>I ate anything that was edible.</i>

111
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,119
<i>I held out like that for two months.</i>

112
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,789
<i>It was difficult to keep track of time,</i>

113
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,250
<i>so it could've actually been
shorter or longer.</i>

114
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,794
<i>When I had nothing left</i>

115
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,589
<i>to eat or drink,</i>

116
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,966
<i>I went outside.</i>

117
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,206
<i>The outside world had become so quiet.</i>

118
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,209
<i>It was dark, even during the day.</i>

119
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,652
<i>And there was no one.</i>

120
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,322
<i>Those who belittled me,</i>

121
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,660
<i>all those arrogant show-offs
and obnoxious jerks.</i>

122
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,121
<i>They were all gone.</i>

123
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,124
That moment, I realized

124
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,920
that those jerks were the ones
who deserved to die,

125
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,048
not me.

126
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,343
Do you know that you're a little weird?

127
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,263
It's too bad.

128
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,766
I should have paid more attention
to my employees' welfare.

129
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,479
I'm sorry, but you're fired, you psycho.

130
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,026
Let's see.

131
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,028

Oh.

everyone addresses me so politely?</i>

175
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,573
<i>Because I've worked here
since the day this company was founded.</i>

176
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,159
Aside from you,
the founder of the company,

177
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,870
I've been here the longest.

178
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,208
<i>Once again,
I won this game of hide-and-seek.</i>

179
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,959
<i>I won last time too.</i>

180
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,671
<i>The time before that too. And I won again.</i>

181
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,095
I told you not to get ahead of yourself.
The game isn't over yet.

182
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,934
<i>Just finish coding the uploader.</i>

183
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,646
<i>Then I'll return your brother safely
as I promised.</i>

184
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,898
You jerk.

185
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,109
Soon, there will be drugs
that can wake him up.

186
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,655
We need him to get on the uploader
and go find his little brother

187
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,908
for this story to begin again.

188
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:38,909
Hey.

189
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,705
-What are you really after?
-<i>What?</i>

190
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,416
Oh, what was it?

191
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,210
Right!

192
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,132
I just can't stand your obnoxious face.

193
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,134
Stay away from me.

194
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,844
Get lost!

195
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,475
Those eyes…

196
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,187
You're no different from the other kids.

197
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:12,151
<i>That arrogant face.
Gosh, I really couldn't stand it.</i>

198
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,654
<i>So I wanted to see, even just once,</i>

199
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,407
<i>you falling apart.</i>

200
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,745
Your family, friends, business,
and even love.

201
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,541
If I take away everything you have,

202
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,003
and if you end up like me,

203
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,423
what kind of face will you make then?

204
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,218
Hey, Sigma.

205
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,596
Let's put an end to this today.

206
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,973
This could be the beginning.

207
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,235
The beginning and the end
are always intertwined.

208
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:01,742
Just like a poor little puppy
that chases its own tail in circles.

209
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,955
You'd better get used to this darkness.

210
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,250
Because that is…

211
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,254
all you have left.

212
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,833
<i>No matter how many chances they're given,</i>

213
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,753
<i>the result is always the same.</i>

214
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,763
<i>Because people repeat the same mistakes</i>

215
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,558
<i>tens of thousands of times.</i>

216
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,270
<i>Regret…</i>

217
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,024
<i>That is what makes the uploader exist.</i>

218
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,236
Is this also part of your grand scheme?

219
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,286
Of course.

220
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,081
Oh, I see.

221
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,172
Soon, the war will kill
tens of millions of people.

222
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,673
It was all part of your plan?

223
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,762
You see, the war started
with just one missile.

224
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,222
The one that hit Wolsong. Boom.

225
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,225
Then it took on a life of its own.

226
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,895
The Ministry of National Defense
struck the North.

227
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,022
Then the North struck back.

228
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,858
The US shot missiles at them,
and so did China.

229
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,277
Kaboom. Then everyone died overnight.

230
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,280
Do you know what's interesting?

231
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,450
Everything burned to ashes,

232
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,662
but this church survived, unscathed.

233
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,918
I suppose God really does exist.

234
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,508
That's why I built the uploader
in the basement here.

235
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,169
Is everything okay?

236
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,422
It's stable.

237
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,883
The data is within
the acceptable error range.

238
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,219
No, I meant,

239
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,555
with you.

240
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,226
What about me?

241
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,146
Yes, I'm okay.

242
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,189
I don't buy that.

243
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,192
How can you be okay?
Everyone up there will die tomorrow.

244
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,528
Right, Baltimore.
Have you given it some thought?

245
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,113
Eddy.

246
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,491
By the time we return from there,
it'll be spring here.

247
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,084
Why won't you go? I made it.

248
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,629
I told you.
There's nothing between us now.

249
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,924
Besides, my mom and I must stay here.

250
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,268
Is it because of that thing?

251
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,103
What do you mean?

252
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,814
-You want to get on that thing.
-Why would I?

253
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,982
You regret everything.

254
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,943
-Don't overreact.
-It's because of Tae-sul, isn't it?

255
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,242
Look at us talking about Tae-sul again.
You see?

256
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,496
While dating you, there wasn't a day
we didn't talk about him.

257
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,791
-Seo-jin, you told me to make that thing--
-Let go!

258
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,087
You built it because of me?
No, don't act all naive.

259
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,341
It was because of Tae-sul.

260
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,427
You want everything that he has.

261
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,137
The CEO position, the uploader,

262
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,764
and me. Am I wrong?

263
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,403
Loser.

264
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,242
This is why

265
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,370
you can never beat Tae-sul.

266
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,814
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

267
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,570
This is nuts.

268
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,658
<i>I only want Han Tae-sul.</i>

269
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,827
I don't need Seo-hae.

270
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,121
So take her and leave Korea

271
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,873
so she won't bother me.

272
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,215
<i>Over there.</i>

273
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,760
What? The Hangang Bridge?

274
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,263
My house was there. A bunker below it.

275
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,856
Gosh.

276
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:49,774
What is this?

277
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,573
SHELTER

278
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,158
I think this is it.

279
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,838
Seo-hae! Are you inside?

280
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,465
Sis!

281
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:16,885
Darn it.

282
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,185
Seo-hae!

283
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,898
Seo-hae!

284
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,693
Sis!

285
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,283
Jae-sun. Is that you?

286
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,827
<i>Jae-sun, I'm here!</i>

287
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,747
Seo-hae? Is that you?

288
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,457
<i>Gang Seo-hae!</i>

289
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,168
I'm locked inside. Let me out.

290
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,754
<i>Are you all right?
But I can't open the door.</i>

291
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,048
Look for the keypad.
The passcode is my birthday.

292
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,800
<i>It's 120930.</i>

293
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,024
Over here!

294
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,943
How do I open this door?

295
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,361
There's a lever on the right.

296
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,743
Are you all right?

297
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,454
How did you get here?

298
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,082
I'll tell you later. Let's hurry.

299
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,166
Wait.

300
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,425
Choi Jae-sun found the girl.

301
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,554
The team nearby can get there
in three minutes.

302
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,140
Just keep an eye on them for now.

303
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,393
-Keep me updated on their location.
-Yes, sir.

304
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,985
<i>We have 250811's current location.
South of the Hangang Bridge.</i>

305
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,030
<i>Agents in the area,
keep monitoring the suspect.</i>

306
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,302
I was at home, and those
Control Bureau jerks barged in again.

307
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,805
I saw this car as I was running away,
so I got in.

308
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,765
Darn it.

309
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,266
<i>The person you are calling is unavailable…</i>

310
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,769
I must go to Tae-sul.

311
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,528
Where are we going?

312
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,326
-Where are we going?
-To the airport.

313
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,495
The flight leaves in three hours.

314
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,249
Let's go to my family's place.
My mom and Go-eun are waiting.

315
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,418
It's a house with many rooms.

316
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,587
-They already decorated your room.
-Jae-sun.

317
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,591
Oh, and there's an outdoor swimming pool.
Awesome, right?

318
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,010
-Pull over.
-The weather's amazing too.

319
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,221
The fine dust level was only 15 yesterday.

320
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,555
I told you to pull over!

321
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,736
It's a two-story house.
The entire second floor is yours.

322
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,822
We're planning to get a dog.

323
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,950
They said the neighborhood is quiet
and the neighbors are nice.

324
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:27,992
So…

325
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,538
-please come with me.
-Who put you up to it?

326
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,039
He said you'll die.

327
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:35,917
Who is "he"?

328
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,420
Sigma.

329
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,842
If I don't leave with you,
my mom and Go-eun will…

330
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,178
Han Tae-sul started all this,
so let him deal with it.

331
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,514
If I run away, everyone here will die.

332
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,890
Please…

333
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,978
Then what about you? You'll die too.

334
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,900
Jae-sun, Tae-sul can't do this alone.

335
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,026
Gosh…

336
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,073
If you don't do it, someone else will.
No one will appreciate this.

337
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,826
Why are you so reckless?
Aren't you scared of dying?

338
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,077
I am.

339
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,373
I am scared. But…

340
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,169
What scares me more
is surviving alone in the world.

341
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,381
You have no idea what it's like.

342
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,593
If you lose everyone you love
and survive alone,

343
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,179
do you think you'll be happy?

344
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,560
Trust me.

345
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,398
I'll save everyone. All of you.

346
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,999
I'll get out here.

347
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,212
Hey, wait.

348
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,825
<i>Jae-sun!</i>

349
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,788
<i>Why do you keep calling?
You'll see us every day.</i>

350
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,291
Mom, Go-eun, I'm sorry.
Looks like I need more time.

351
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,668
Why?

352
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,837
Mom, I put all the money
into your account.

353
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,464
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

354
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,050
Take good care of Mom. Hey, Mom.

355
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,802
<i>Jae-sun!</i>

356
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,805
-Mom, I'm sorry.
-<i>Jae-sun!</i>

357
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,198
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

358
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,832
Don't die.
You went through hoops to return.

359
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,044
You should go to nice places
and eat good food.

360
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,755
I'll take you to all the nice places.

361
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,757
Where should we go first?

362
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,607
Jae-sun.

363
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,196
Jae-sun…

364
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,632
Go ahead and kill me.

365
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,053
You already killed my mom,
so kill me and everyone else.

366
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,306
You murderer. Kill me now!

367
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,432
Don't move.

368
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,811
I'll kill you as you wish.

369
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,462
The keys under the flower pot.

370
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,966
And the white dog in your yard.

371
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,761
Your mother couldn't see well,

372
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,097
and you cooked instant noodles for her.

373
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,976
Your mother…

374
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,063
seemed at ease
as she was breathing her last.

375
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,583
Get lost.

376
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,470
Jae-sun, hey.

377
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,142
Seo-hae.

378
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,688
Am I dying?

379
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,900
No, you won't die.

380
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,954
This can be a little uncomfortable
at first.

381
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,460
But once you get used to it,
it's very nice.

382
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,049
Go.

383
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,245
No.

384
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,375
No.

385
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:05,968
Hey.

386
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,057
Has Choi Jae-sun found Gang Seo-hae yet?

387
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,439
Choi Jae-sun is dead,

388
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,942
and Gang Seo-hae's on her way to Sigma.

389
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,404
All right. Well done.

390
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,115
This is my last mission.

391
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:32,119
Making sure everything's going
according to the plan.

392
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,829
If anything goes wrong,

393
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,332
I must revise the records,

394
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,751
so the next Sigma can read up on it.

395
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,004
That's what the Control Bureau does?

396
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,925
When I was working at the NIS,

397
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,011
I was sent out to surveil
the opposition party. To collect intel.

398
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,139
It was something that we always did,
off the record.

399
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,724
That's where I first heard

400
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,394
about the people from the future.

401
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,399
I was transferred to the Control Bureau
immediately after that.

402
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,069
The higher-ups promised me
that they'd ensure

403
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,697
my family's safety
if I finished the job quietly

404
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,450
until the last day.

405
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:16,664
Thanks to that, I couldn't even be there
when my wife died,

406
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,542
and my daughter hated me.

407
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,179
Gang Seo-hae said
she didn't kill my mother.

408
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,640
So?

409
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,852
I want to know the truth.

410
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,688
Okay.

411
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,275
I…

412
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,236
killed your mother.

413
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,830
<i>I also killed the future you
who crossed over.</i>

414
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,671
That woman is the prime suspect.
She's an illegal entrant.

415
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:09,175
She shot and killed your mother,
who couldn't even fight back.

416
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,306
<i>I lied to you</i>

417
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,726
so you'd join the Control Bureau.

418
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,605
-But why?
-Because that's what the report says.

419
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,151
I only followed the instructions
in the report.

420
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,403
You…

421
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,655
You bastard.

422
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,577
HWANG HYUN-SEUNG CASE REPORT

423
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,296
SHOT AND KILLED ON OCTOBER 31, 2020
SUSPECT: JUNG HYEON-GI

424
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,548
In Chinese,

425
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,384
"fate" and "order"
share the same character.

426
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,387
Do you know why that is?

427
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,558
It's because you can't disobey your fate.

428
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,603
This is my last order.

429
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,439
Shoot me.

430
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,783
I've been waiting for this day.

431
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,203
You were recruited as a gunner,
so you won't make a mistake.

432
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:21,747
Shoot me.

433
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,303
<i>Don't move.</i>

434
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,514
I'll kill you as you wish.

435
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,815
Get lost.

436
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,287
I won't shoot.

437
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,125
And I won't go back

438
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,336
after killing you because of regret.

439
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,798
I will not kill anyone…

440
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,012
or beat myself up.

441
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,057
No. You must shoot me.

442
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,615
Losing a parent is like

443
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,702
losing a part of yourself.

444
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,414
You feel dead even though you're alive.

445
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,750
YEAR 2035

446
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,458
This is the place.

447
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,795
Hang in there. We're almost there.

448
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,463
Okay.

449
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,022
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

450
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,377
Dad.

451
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,213
Go. Hurry!

452
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:19,920
Move back!

453
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,466
If this goes off, we'll all die! Move!

454
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,472
-Run on the count of three.
-No.

455
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,932
-One.
-Dad!

456
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:32,975
Two.

457
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,728
Stop.

458
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,713
Look who's here.

459
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,176
Can I guess your name?

460
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,726
Seo-hae. You're Gang Seo-hae, right?

461
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,937
Who are you?

462
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,647
Me?

463
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,650
The owner of this uploader?

464
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,748
Sigma?

465
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,334
That's right.

466
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,012
What are you doing here?
Trying to get on the uploader?

467
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,722
To do what?

468
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,142
I'll stop the war.

469
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,770
How?

470
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,191
I will save Han Tae-sul and kill you.

471
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,669
Hey, did you hear that? My gosh.

472
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,380
You can lower your guns. Just lower them.

473
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,759
Lower your guns.

474
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,724
Seriously, you're…

475
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,145
How cute.

476
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,690
You'll kill me?

477
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,366
Let them go.

478
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,910
Pardon?

479
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,039
They want to cross over. Just let them go.

480
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,711
Hey, your father's wound looks very deep.

481
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,963
He won't survive the uploader ride.

482
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,383
You should just stay here.

483
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,760
No. I won't go if we can't go together.

484
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:19,766
Dad.

485
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,395
What? Are you worried
I wouldn't let your daughter go?

486
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:28,191
Come on. You already know
that she'll get there safe and sound.

487
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:30,986
Don't listen to him.

488
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,573
-Okay.
-Dad!

489
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:36,992
Seo-hae.

490
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,829
I'll see you later.

491
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,462
Oh, wait. I almost forgot.

492
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,506
On the last day,

493
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,134
meet me at the church.

494
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:46,269
<i>Seo-hae, wake up.</i>

495
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,106
Dad.

496
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,109
Time to go. It's your turn now.

497
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,333
<i>Anything that weighs over 30kg
is not allowed in.</i>

498
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,585
<i>Microbial substances, living creatures,</i>

499
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,755
<i>and explosive materials are not permitted.</i>

500
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,175
<i>We assume no responsibility
and shall not be liable</i>

501
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,094
<i>for any injury, death, and accidents</i>

502
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,679
<i>that occurs during your trip.</i>

503
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,940
Let's go together, Dad.

504
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,360
I don't think I can go with you.

505
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,032
Tell me what I told you.

506
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,410
First, when you arrive.

507
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,373
-When you arrive!
-"Start running."

508
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,126
Do not let anyone catch you,
no matter what.

509
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,046
If you get caught,
just don't say anything.

510
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,716
Just pretend you can't talk. Okay?

511
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,012
Yes. But let's go together--

512
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,305
Second.

513
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:06,892
Hurry up!

514
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,938
"Do not trust anyone."

515
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,067
You never know who's your ally
and who's your real enemy.

516
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,155
Don't trust anyone. No one. Okay?

517
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,616
Okay.

518
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,161
Good. What was the third thing?

519
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,831
Come on.

520
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,959
-Number 250811!
-Coming!

521
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,588
Quick. What was it?

522
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,259
"Han Tae-sul."

523
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,056
Han Tae-sul.
Stay away from him at all costs.

524
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,310
You must not cross paths with him.
Don't even talk to him, okay?

525
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,395
Then what about Mom?

526
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,481
What if she dies?

527
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,945
We all die in the end.

528
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,868
But I can't leave you alone here, Dad.

529
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,130
When you get there,
you'll find lots of good food

530
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,758
and all of your favorite fruits.

531
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,135
Real fruit, not the canned ones.

532
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,305
So just go.

533
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,683
Eat everything you want.

534
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,060
And do whatever you want.

535
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,939
Just enjoy your life.

536
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,652
Promise me.

537
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,530
-Number 250811!
-Coming!

538
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,160
Promise me.
If you don't, I won't let you go.

539
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,215
Let's go.

540
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:42,464
Seo-hae.

541
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:47,510
The war already took place,
and it'll happen again.

542
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,305
It's not something you can stop alone.

543
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,602
Forget all about it
and run away to somewhere safe.

544
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,355
I'm letting you go
so you can live a happy life.

545
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,238
I love you, my dear daughter.

546
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,676
You should go.

547
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,096
Go on.

548
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,489
I will meet him.

549
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,993
I'll meet Han Tae-sul and stop the war.

550
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,705
I can do it.

551
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,501
We can do it, Dad.

552
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,622
Ready for transmission.

553
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:43,835
You'll be unstable for a while
after you arrive.

554
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,327
Why did you hide the girl?

555
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,539
I saw the future.

556
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,834
The future where I win.

557
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,923
You'll get shot in the head.

558
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,762
I do not think that will happen.

559
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,602
Finish coding the uploader.

560
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,064
We made slight changes to the capacity.
Thanks in advance.

561
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,659
Maximum density, 2,000kg per…

562
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,494
Are you sending something heavy?

563
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:46,833
Hey.

564
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,922
You used this to explode the nuclear bomb.
Am I right?

565
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:05,184
<i>It'd be such a waste to only use this
to transport those lowlifes.</i>

566
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,647
<i>We should use it for things
that can make us money. Weapons and bombs.</i>

567
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,776
<i>Weapons are everywhere in the future,
but no one to kill.</i>

568
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,535
Boom.

569
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:31,628
Gosh, I did consider doing it for you,

570
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,964
but I refuse to help you.

571
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:41,971
Soon, your girlfriend will get shot here,
and you'll cry your eyes out.

572
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,183
If you'll do it anyway,
why not just do it now?

573
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,062
Well, I do not think that will happen.

574
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,149
I'm not sure if you've heard this before.

575
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:57,070
"The future is already here.
You just don't know it yet."

576
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,697
Gosh, such a cliché.

577
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,574
Where is she now?

578
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,913
-Current location.
-<i>Almost there.</i>

579
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,041
-She's almost here, sir.
-Get ready.

580
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,342
What?
You didn't know that she'd come here?

581
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,389
Why bother hiding her?
You guys are in the palm of my hand.

582
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,518
Oh, what was his name?

583
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,646
Right, Sun. He's dead.

584
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,120
I had to infuriate her
to make her come here voluntarily.

585
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,832
Don't get too nervous.

586
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,167
It'll be quick.

587
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:30,830
Why must she make such a fuss?
She can just walk in quietly.

588
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,200
-What?
-What's going on?

589
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,118
She's here.

590
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:10,661
What?

591
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:12,830
Seo-hae is here.

592
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:15,917
Yes.

593
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,387
How many are outside?

594
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:32,391
Everyone except for the three of us
and those at the rear exit.

595
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,027
But I see four.

596
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,689
Gosh, I'm really impressed.

597
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,734
You came to save this guy,
knowing you'll die.

598
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,987
Very impressive.

599
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,533
Thank you very much
for coming here voluntarily.

600
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,993
You can't kill him.

601
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,453
Dropping the honorifics now?
What about you?

602
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,583
Shoot me. This is a golden opportunity.

603
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,509
What is it?

604
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:51,804
You can't do it?

605
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:00,187
I'll tell you why you're hesitating.

606
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,399
Because you love him.

607
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,407
You love him!

608
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:18,998
You two should thank me. I worked
very hard for you two to end up together.

609
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:24,211
Remember the day you first met?
Wasn't that so thrilling?

610
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,693
Han Tae-sul! Get down!

611
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,200
<i>The woman who saved your life,
like destiny.</i>

612
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,826
<i>Isn't it so amazing?</i>

613
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,455
Don't give me that look.

614
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,707
Once, I missed you on purpose.

615
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,809
-<i>It's natural</i>
-She had a wound somewhere here.

616
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:23,980
<i>to develop feelings for each other
when you go through hardships together.</i>

617
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,859
<i>While helping and saving each other</i>

618
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,487
<i>and making sacrifices.</i>

619
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,282
<i>That's how love begins.</i>

620
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,083
<i>And once it begins, it can't be stopped.</i>

621
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,212
<i>You can't help but love him even though</i>

622
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,923
<i>you couldn't avenge your dad's death
because of him.</i>

623
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,178
Tae-sul.

624
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,640
You must think you've chased me this far
because you're smart.

625
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,434
You're wrong.

626
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:05,896
All you did was follow the trail
of bread crumbs that I left for you.

627
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,110
It's you. The copilot on that flight.

628
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,195
What happened? Who did this to you?

629
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,239
The Control Bureau.

630
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:18,701
Are you on their side?

631
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,705
Among the e-mails, death threats,
and malicious comments he received…

632
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:23,622
SEO WON-JU

633
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,502
I told them not to use that photo.

634
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,420
SEO WON-JU

635
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,756
Sigma.

636
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:34,091
Seo-hae!

637
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,581
<i>Your destination is 48km away.</i>

638
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:06,832
Turn it off.

639
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:14,757
I'm sorry, sir.

640
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,058
How lovely is this?

641
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,938
You will make the uploader now. Why?

642
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,732
Because you love her.

643
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:37,404
From beginning to end, all of it.

644
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,325
It was all part of my plan.

645
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,372
Oh, no. I won again.

646
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,955
<i>I get it now.</i>

647
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,040
<i>No.</i>

648
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,459
I knew it all along.

649
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,087
The uploader code.

650
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,798
Don't make the uploader.
If you don't, we'll win.

651
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,133
<i>It's over.</i>

652
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,843
Shoot her!

653
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:24,553
Han Tae-sul!

654
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,307
<i>Whatever happens from now on,</i>

655
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:31,518
just trust me.

656
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,897
<i>Did you not expect this?</i>

657
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,357
<i>The future can change.</i>
