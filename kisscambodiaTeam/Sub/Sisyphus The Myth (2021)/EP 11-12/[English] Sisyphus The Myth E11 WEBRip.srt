1
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:02,020
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,612
Mom?

3
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,948
Dad.

4
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,041
Mom.

5
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,549
You shouldn't have come here today.

6
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,050
Why?

7
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,844
It's not my fault.

8
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,804
What do you mean?

9
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,724
He's here

10
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,518
right now.

11
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,103
Who?

12
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,105
Who's here?

13
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,165
Look who's here.

14
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,591
Finally we meet, Mr. Han Tae-sul.

15
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,509
What's going on here?

16
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,347
This? Ask this old lady here.

17
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,894
Hey, easy!

18
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,231
Hey, come on. Easy. Goodness.

19
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,485
Okay, all right. Jeez!
Let me take these off at least.

20
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,989
So it was you.

21
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,992
Long time no see.

22
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,079
Why did you bring him here?

23
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,959
Mr. Han here kept pestering me
for the cure like crazy.

24
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,085
I had no choice.

25
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,172
You ruined everything, you bastard.

26
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,425
Gosh. Sister Agnes.

27
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,554
We both did some bad stuff.

28
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,808
It's not like you can undo them
by praying.

29
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,477
Enough.

30
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,814
Let him out.

31
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,610
Enough, okay?

32
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,664
Come on! Don't do this to me.
We're like partners.

33
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,083
You, 101.

34
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,170
I told you I can't stand people
who don't keep their word.

35
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,590
You're the one who didn't keep
your promise, bastard.

36
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,426
Why didn't you send my wife and kid?

37
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,013
I kept my promise.

38
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:09,058
I found your wife and daughter
and took them to the uploader myself.

39
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,103
It was their choice whether to get on it.

40
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,982
Maybe

41
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,319
she doesn't want to see her daddy.

42
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:27,118
I swear,
I will kill you with my own hands.

43
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,755
Some people can't handle it
when they're treated with respect.

44
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,674
Sit down.

45
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,551
All right, thanks.

46
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,514
Oh, boy.

47
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,686
Sorry it got a little tense there
when we just met.

48
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,191
Han Tae-sul, it's very nice to meet you.

49
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,027
Likewise.

50
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,822
Why did you leave like that last time?
I was disappointed.

51
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,408
That wasn't the day for us to meet.

52
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,494
Then what about today?

53
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,580
You arranged this meeting?
Were you finally ready to meet me?

54
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,793
I came here to see Agnes.

55
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,713
I did think you might come here,

56
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,424
but you actually did.

57
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,427
Had I known,
I would have put on nicer clothes.

58
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,680
Why are you here?

59
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,432
To get the cure.

60
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:36,270
Oh, no.
I guess that girl got the injection.

61
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,272
You probably know this already,

62
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,026
but Agnes made that drug
to torture people from the future.

63
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,529
You see, she despises illegal entrants.

64
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,366
So why should we give you the cure?

65
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,539
Agnes, I guess he thought
we'd just hand it over.

66
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,918
On a side note,

67
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,881
I really don't understand
why one would make poison

68
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,592
and also create an antidote to it.

69
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:11,556
You shouldn't do something you'd regret
in the first place.

70
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,724
Why go to such lengths to undo it?

71
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,519
Right? Don't you agree?

72
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,692
In my opinion, people are fickle-minded

73
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,695
because they aren't honest
with themselves.

74
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,114
What do you think?

75
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,285
What? Why are you scoffing?

76
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,498
Then I suppose
you're very honest with yourself.

77
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,128
I know what kind of a person I am.

78
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,088
And I know exactly what I want.

79
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,633
So I don't change my mind easily,
and I never lie.

80
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,470
You can believe every word I say.

81
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,266
You start a war, but you don't lie?

82
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,184
That's right.

83
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:00,771
Is that so?
Then, what do you want from me?

84
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,106
Your uploader.

85
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,486
Can you finish coding the program?

86
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,987
Then I'll save the girl.

87
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,864
No, I won't.

88
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:11,991
Why not?

89
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,536
-Did you ask why?
-Yes, isn't it an enticing offer?

90
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:21,042
Because the world will fall to pieces
because of the uploader.

91
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:21,959
Wait.

92
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,589
To be precise, it's just the Korean
peninsula, not the entire world.

93
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,886
By the way, the world can't fall
to pieces? Why not?

94
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,598
Gosh, that crazy bastard.

95
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,521
People always swear
when they have nothing to say.

96
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,523
Hey, I'm not crazy.

97
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,733
Answer my question.

98
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,654
Why shouldn't the world end?

99
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,614
Well…

100
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,743
Where do I begin?

101
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,872
First off, normal people

102
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,959
wouldn't want the world to end.

103
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,252
You're wrong.

104
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,755
Go ask anyone you see on the streets.

105
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,094
"In front of you, there's a nuke button
to end the world. Will you press it?"

106
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,349
I bet so many people will say yes.

107
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,935
Look on the Internet.

108
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,730
You see countless people
who want the world to end.

109
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,357
And some people say this.

110
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,568
"There are too many people on this planet.

111
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,363
We must wipe out
75 percent of the world population."

112
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,200
Han Tae-sul.

113
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,080
I bet you're no different.

114
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,545
Why don't we do a little experiment?

115
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,808
Take it.

116
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,352
You know how to shoot a gun, right?

117
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,646
Just pull the trigger.

118
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,661
Shoot me.

119
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,124
If you kill me now,
you can save the world.

120
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,378
Shoot me.

121
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,640
Come on.

122
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,185
Do it.

123
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,859
Shoot me.

124
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,679
You just

125
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,432
pressed the nuclear button.

126
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,185
I bet this was your train of thought.

127
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,730
If you kill me,
my buddies here will kill you.

128
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:34,068
They'll also kill Agnes and 101.
You won't be able to get the cure.

129
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,028
So that girl will die too.

130
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,909
You made a choice that will end the world
just because of a girl.

131
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,913
But don't beat yourself up too much.

132
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,541
That's just how people are.

133
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,042
Even if everyone were to die,

134
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,295
they'd still put themselves,
their families, and money first.

135
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,756
Agnes is no exception.

136
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,261
She can't shoot me because
I'm taking good care of her mother.

137
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,639
Neither can 101
since he wants something from me.

138
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,311
I gave everyone a chance,

139
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,856
but not a single person chose
to save the world.

140
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,737
I'll be honest with you.
I really don't care about the future.

141
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,573
I mean, why would I…

142
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,494
You folks call me despicable.

143
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,664
But you're the despicable ones.

144
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,293
You're putting all the blame on me.

145
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,961
Then,

146
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,465
why did you kill Kim Dong-hyeon?

147
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,260
Tell me. You said you never lie.

148
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,263
-Kim Dong-hyeon was--
-What about my brother?

149
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,099
Why? What did he do wrong?

150
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,894
You said other people are putting
all the blame on you.

151
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,022
-As for your brother--
-You're the one

152
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,317
who's blaming others for what you did
with your sophistry.

153
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,860
Don't cut me off.

154
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,115
I didn't do anything to your brother.

155
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,744
I did yell at him to scare him a little,

156
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:10,456
but 101 and Agnes are the ones
who put him through hell.

157
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,000
They deceived him and used him.

158
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,212
I guess you haven't told him yet.

159
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,132
We're just business partners.

160
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,260
I'll fill you in on the details later.

161
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,893
You see, Kim Dong-hyeon betrayed me.

162
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,272
I turned a brokerage clerk into a magnate.
But then he tried to kill me.

163
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,942
I just took back what I had given him.

164
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,611
But come to think of it,

165
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:45,491
Agnes and 101 aren't the ones
who tortured your brother the most.

166
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,664
It's you, Han Tae-sul.

167
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,589
Okay, back to where we started.
Let me ask you again.

168
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,759
I was going to get the blueprint
from your brother.

169
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,469
But he got away, thanks to someone.

170
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,684
Can you make it again?

171
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,603
Get lost.

172
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,113
That's your answer?

173
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,372
You said you came here for the cure.

174
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,708
Take it.

175
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,380
It must be injected in a specific way.
If you're not sure, take Agnes too.

176
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,715
What are you up to?

177
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,468
I just like you.

178
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,308
My, I wasn't ready for that.

179
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,769
I mean it. I really like you.

180
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,314
You're so precious to me.

181
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,649
You're the last piece of the puzzle
for my plan.

182
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,903
That's why I invested in your research.

183
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,365
If it weren't for me, you'd still be stuck

184
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,286
in that shipping container,
running your physics engine by yourself.

185
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,288
Right?

186
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,420
Everything you've achieved so far…

187
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,923
You owe it all to me.

188
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,428
You should feel grateful once in a while.

189
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,891
Hey, 101.

190
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,602
What should I do with you?

191
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,481
I'm the one who dug you up,
so I can simply bury you back in.

192
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,954
I think you could still be useful,
so I'll spare you for now.

193
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,374
But if you betray me one more time,

194
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,921
I'll send your wife and daughter to you,
dead.

195
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,140
Got anything to say? Or any questions?

196
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,561
You sneaked into my place

197
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,649
<i>and wrote "Don't look for your brother."
How did you do that?</i>

198
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,484
IF YOU DO, YOU'LL DIE

199
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,737
I used spray paint.

200
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,155
I mean, how did you get in?

201
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,699
Oh.

202
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,660
You see,

203
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,997
I can get in anywhere.

204
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,420
That's it?

205
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,548
All right, then.

206
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,636
I'll see you again.

207
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:00,644
Oh, right. I didn't ask you this
because I wasn't sure.

208
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,647
Han Tae-sul.

209
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,277
Don't you remember me?

210
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,664
I guess you don't.

211
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,542
Sorry about that.
But aren't you guys going to flee?

212
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,795
There will be a war. If you stay here…

213
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,048
-It's all blocked anyway.
-What do you mean?

214
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,259
Illegal entrants get caught
if they go near the airport.

215
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,886
The Control Bureau, you know?

216
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,596
I sure know about them.

217
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,771
Damn it!

218
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,650
Doesn't that thing download people
from the future?

219
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,818
Why? Is it broken?

220
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,320
That scum Han Tae-sul
backed up the server.

221
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,074
Isn't that a good thing?
There will be no war. Am I wrong?

222
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,660
I guess I'm wrong.

223
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,995
Oh, because you have to shut down
your business?

224
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,455
That's none of your business.

225
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,835
I'm waiting for one more person.

226
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,378
Who?

227
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,257
Shut it, will you?
You're really getting on my nerves.

228
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,219
You need a license to own a firearm,
and minors can't possess guns.

229
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,180
Is that so? I didn't know.

230
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,894
-Hey.
-What?

231
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,565
Did Sigma or whatever his name is
also cross over through this thing?

232
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,693
-Yes.
-And he starts a war?

233
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,362
-That's right.
-Is Tae-sul that much of a genius?

234
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,822
Only he can fix this thing?

235
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,615
Yes, because he invented it.

236
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,034
He invented
both the uploader and the downloader.

237
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,830
So without him, there will be no Sigma.

238
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,876
Because the uploader
hasn't been invented yet. Right?

239
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,212
And there will be no war.

240
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,382
Well, I guess so.

241
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,641
By the way, why didn't you leave?

242
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,685
That visa was very expensive.

243
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,565
-I know I should.
-You'd better hurry.

244
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,442
Leave when flights can still take off.

245
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,028
I know.

246
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,615
But do people in the future
not use honorifics?

247
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,284
We do. Why do you ask?

248
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,371
Never mind. I was just curious.

249
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,171
Did you get the cure?

250
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,529
She seems to be asleep, but she's
in a state of temporal displacement.

251
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,284
She'll help us.

252
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,788
The receiver.

253
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,710
Get started right away.

254
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,713
Those of you who don't have
any business here, leave the room.

255
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,216
Get out, all of you.

256
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,347
Did you not hear me?
Get out, except for Tae-sul.

257
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,185
-Me too?
-Then do you want to do this?

258
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,436
I'll get out, then.

259
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:16,441
All right. Get it done quickly.
No funny business.

260
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,819
Guys, let's go.

261
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,460
Let's begin.

262
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,340
She's lost and wandering aimlessly.

263
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,927
She seems to be asleep right now,

264
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,764
but she's actually wandering around
different timelines.

265
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,516
I heard that. So what do we do?

266
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,730
We can't wake her up
by giving her the injection here.

267
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,692
Someone has to go to where she is
and administer the injection.

268
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,611
But it's too dangerous.

269
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,197
It will take a toll on you.

270
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,135
Wait, Tae-sul.

271
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,181
If you fail, you can't come back.

272
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,019
First, let's find out what's going on.
When we know more…

273
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,273
FOS decomposition. This is it, right?

274
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,237
Why are you doing all this?

275
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,822
I told you.

276
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,826
I don't want to lose her.

277
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,340
Inject 10ml, and the FOS proteins
will start breaking down.

278
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,883
Then you'll be transported.

279
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,551
To which point in time?

280
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,513
Sometime in her past.

281
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,474
Go there and find her.

282
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,184
Then what?

283
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,194
There's one shot for each of you.

284
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,533
There's no more, so you must pick
the right time to administer it.

285
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,453
Do it when you're as close
to the present time as you can be.

286
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,788
Okay?

287
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,670
If you lose this or make a mistake,
you won't be able to return.

288
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,005
You'll wander through
the space-time forever.

289
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:51,138
What? Like a wandering ghost?

290
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,600
What?

291
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,271
Where's number one?

292
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,402
That one failed.

293
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,238
My gosh.

294
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,157
What a relief.

295
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,619
Make a fist.

296
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,421
You know, right?

297
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,549
This is exactly what Sigma wants.

298
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,431
I deceived you my whole life.

299
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:39,102
I made you look like a lunatic
and put you in danger.

300
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,897
This morning, I even locked you up.

301
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,610
Will you still get this shot?

302
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,405
I have no other choice.

303
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,409
Even if you do this,
the future won't change, Tae-sul.

304
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,329
It's not about saving that girl.

305
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,914
Don't you get it?

306
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,959
For you, it's the future.
But for me, it's the past.

307
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,546
No matter how hard we try,
we can't change our past.

308
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,966
We can't undo our mistakes
or the things that we regret.

309
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,551
The future won't change, either.

310
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,807
Because your future is
a mirror image of your past.

311
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:23,104
It's your reflection in the mirror.

312
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,733
Even if you can't stand
what you see in the mirror,

313
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,860
and feel ashamed of it,
you can't change it.

314
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,737
Because that's who you are.

315
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,615
Tae-sul.

316
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,369
You can't beat the mirror
no matter how fast you are.

317
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,624
Seo-jin, I don't think I agree with you.

318
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,629
The mirror can't be faster than us.

319
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,334
Good luck.

320
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,378
Thanks.

321
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,862
Gang Seo-hae!

322
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,049
HONG U-HYEONG, KIM HYE-JIN

323
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:07,519
MY HAPPY FAMILY
GANG SEO-HAE

324
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,736
Hey, kids. Wait, just a second.

325
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,489
Strangers aren't allowed to come in.

326
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:24,119
Right, sorry. But I'm looking for someone.

327
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,620
A girl.

328
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:29,666
Her hair comes down to here.
She's quite tall.

329
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,918
And she's pretty. Have you seen her?

330
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,753
-No.
-No, we haven't.

331
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,258
Mister, are you not feeling well?

332
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,552
I'm fine.

333
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,720
You don't look well.
You should see a doctor.

334
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,246
What was that?

335
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,877
Seo-hae.

336
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,466
Seo-hae!

337
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,009
Seo-hae…

338
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,971
Seo-hae. Gang Seo-hae!

339
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,016
Oh, my.

340
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,894
-Look here! Look at me.
-Let's go to Mommy.

341
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,646
-Make a V!
-Let's go!

342
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,066
Make a V.

343
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,447
-Keep pedaling.
-Make a V!

344
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,160
Nice. Turn around.

345
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,538
Seo-hae…

346
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,710
Seo-hae.

347
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,798
Gang Seo-hae.

348
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,512
Seo-hae.

349
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,306
Seo-hae.

350
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,104
Get off of me.

351
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,481
Seo-hae…

352
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:01,943
What's wrong?

353
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,154
Gosh, I have a splitting headache.

354
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,160
Seo-hae, are you all right?

355
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,582
What are you doing here?

356
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,793
I came to save you.

357
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,753
This is…

358
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,257
It's very complicated.

359
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:29,262
But to put it simply, I risked my life

360
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,432
and traveled back in time to save you.

361
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,311
I'm so cool, right?

362
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,109
Thanks.

363
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,322
So what do we do now?

364
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,117
I'll take you home.

365
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,577
Your parents are waiting.

366
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,581
I'll take you to the present
and give you an antidote.

367
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,876
Just a second.

368
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,008
Hey, are you all right?

369
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,316
Are you okay?

370
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:36,621
MARRIED COUPLE IN THEIR 30S KILLED
WHILE HELPING TRAFFIC ACCIDENT VICTIMS

371
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,623
Where are we?

372
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,421
This is my childhood.

373
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,593
Something is wrong.

374
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,722
REST IN PEACE, FATHER AND MOTHER

375
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,936
From now on, I'll be your mom and dad.

376
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,647
I'll pack your lunch for school
every morning.

377
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,857
With your favorites.

378
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,735
Ham and anchovies.
I can make all those things.

379
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,072
Nothing's changed.

380
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,826
My gosh.

381
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,704
This must be so hard for you.

382
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,583
You must stay strong
for your little brother

383
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:28,172
so your late father can rest in peace.

384
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,009
Hey, Tae-san.

385
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,762
The thing is…

386
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,766
I feel horrible bringing this up
on a day like this.

387
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,145
-Gosh, how do I begin…
-You can tell me.

388
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,065
Before your dad passed away,

389
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,693
he borrowed some money from me.

390
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,028
That's a lie.

391
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,406
He's lying to take
the insurance money from us.

392
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,576
Tae-san, don't listen to that jerk.
He's trying to dupe you.

393
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,163
Get yourself together. They can't see us.

394
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,001
PROMISSORY
395
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,919
BORROWER: HAN DONG-MIN
5 MILLION WON

395
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,436
Let's get out of here.

396
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,485
Yes, teacher.

397
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,696
I'll go to a vocational high school.

398
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,281
I won't go to college.

399
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,868
I'm sorry.

400
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,200
Going well?

401
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,911
I'll tell him when he comes back.

402
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,832
Come on.

403
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,292
Mr. Han Tae-sul will never see you again

404
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,671
if he finds out what you did
to Han Tae-san.

405
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,758
It's all your fault.

406
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:40,221
You promised that we'd go to Tae-sul
together if I got Tae-san out.

407
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,141
But what did you do?

408
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:47,228
You stole the safe and everything else.
I nearly died because of you.

409
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,898
It's not like I did well because of you.

410
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:57,155
You let Han Tae-san slip away.

411
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,783
So Sigma got all angry,
and I almost died because of it.

412
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,787
I'd say we're even.

413
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:09,000
We all did some bad things.

414
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:15,923
You stuck-up, don't talk like
you've never dirtied your hands.

415
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,597
Just wrap that up well,
and don't look at me like that.

416
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:46,454
<i>You disobeyed orders, committed theft,
conducted unauthorized interrogation,</i>

417
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,041
lost a suspect, used your gun,
and left the office without permission.

418
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,292
Impressive.

419
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,211
Got anything to say?

420
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,550
-Am I one of the people who came back?
-What?

421
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,177
That's what 811 told me.

422
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,888
That I took the uploader from the future…

423
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,933
Hyeon-gi, I told you.

424
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,936
We don't believe what
illegal entrants say. She lied to you.

425
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,605
Is 811

426
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,524
really Lieutenant Gang's daughter?

427
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,737
She is. That we've verified.

428
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,158
Looks like 811 already met
Lieutenant Gang and his wife.

429
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,077
The day we captured the girl,

430
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,287
Lieutenant Gang's wife was there.

431
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,665
And we have security footage

432
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,292
that shows Han Tae-sul
visiting his home a few days ago.

433
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,088
I sent a few agents over,
but they lost him after a fight.

434
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,757
We're trying to track down
the entire family.

435
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,802
Based on what we've got so far,

436
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:46,389
it doesn't seem like 811 ended up
at your place by coincidence.

437
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,768
There's a chance that
Lieutenant Gang gave her your address

438
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,771
before she got on the uploader
in the future.

439
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,942
It must've been the perfect place for her
to get a gun and a car

440
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,903
upon her arrival in the present.

441
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:06,075
Did you always keep a gun at home?

442
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,743
Yes.

443
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,747
This is why you have to be careful
of those who know you well.

444
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,253
The higher-ups are fuming mad
that you let a suspect get away.

445
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,714
A letter of apology won't be enough.

446
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,218
Stay home until I call you.

447
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:25,720
Sir.

448
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,640
You can return to work
when things die down.

449
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,520
-Return your gun and radio.
-Sir!

450
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:35,938
Now.

451
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,838
Go get some rest.

452
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,520
CONTROL BUREAU TEAM 7 CHIEF

453
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,902
Hey.

454
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,704
It's been a while, sir.

455
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,249
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

456
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,379
I was just stopping by. How did it go?

457
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,714
I took care of it
as per your instructions.

458
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,175
Good.

459
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,928
Will that be sufficient though?

460
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,471
Of course.

461
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,080
CHO CHAN-HYEOK

462
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,332
EXPATRIATE LIST

463
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,459
GANG SEO-HAE

464
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,794
GANG SEO-HAE

465
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,962
DETAILS
1ST HALF OF 2011

466
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,383
<i>Was his name Jung Hyeon-gi?</i>

467
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,595
You see, people just believe

468
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,639
what they want to believe.

469
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:21,479
Rather than admitting that his mother died
while he was neglecting her out of anger…

470
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,400
Seeking revenge is easier
than living with guilt.

471
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,739
I'm sure he wants to blame
someone else, you know?

472
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,076
You're truly impressive.

473
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,954
Oh, come on.

474
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,000
So Han Tae-sul is taken care of.

475
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,670
We've dealt with Jung Hyeon-gi as well.

476
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,259
Then do we just wait now?

477
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,179
We just need to build the uploader now.

478
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,979
Tell everyone I want to say goodbye
in person before I leave.

479
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,356
Yes, sir.

480
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,694
Tae-sul, Mom and Dad are in heaven now.

481
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,116
They passed away after saving many lives,

482
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,326
so I'm sure they're in heaven now.

483
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,291
If we do good deeds and never hurt others,
we'll meet them again.

484
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,001
No.

485
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:08,961
What?

486
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,173
Tae-san, time is irreversible.

487
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,801
The second law of thermodynamics.

488
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:20,472
In a thermally isolated system,
the entropy can never decrease.

489
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,642
So natural processes
and the past-future asymmetry…

490
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:31,275
Anyway, we can't see Mom and Dad again.

491
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,778
We'll never see them again.

492
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,716
You said we must return to 2020.

493
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,509
Why are we lost in your past?

494
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,265
I have no idea what's going on either.
There must've been a mix-up.

495
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,894
We just keep moving forward
in time, right?

496
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,066
Don't let it get to you.

497
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,361
You've already been through this once,
so just let it go.

498
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:17,696
Okay.

499
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,499
Lie on my lap.

500
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,215
Let's sleep here tonight.
This is still a house, you know.

501
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,303
Looks like this used to be
someone's bedroom.

502
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,765
See? There's wallpaper on the wall.

503
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,774
-What about the blue part?
-That's easy.

504
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,903
If you draw these lines,

505
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,698
it's like subtracting the square
from the circle.

506
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,491
How?

507
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,954
First, draw this. Then like this.

508
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,957
So what's the answer?

509
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,255
If we say the radius is 10cm,
it should be 228cm².

510
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,217
You're the smartest person I know.

511
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,471
-Are you cold?
-Yes.

512
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,508
I've never seen him cry before.

513
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,637
He never cried in front of me.

514
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,228
Tae-sul, we can't stay here.

515
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,575
I know that door scares you.

516
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,578
We don't know what we'll encounter next.

517
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,164
I saw my past too.

518
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,625
My mom, dad, and the war.

519
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,628
Be prepared.

520
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,922
That's all you can do.

521
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,441
CONGRATULATIONS
QUANTUM & TIME LISTED ON NASDAQ

522
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,531
What happened on this day?

523
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,744
This is the day my brother died.

524
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,331
My gosh.

525
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,627
Let's become rich, Tae-sul.

526
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:30,509
I provided this guy with room and board
all through college.

527
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,261
Turns out, it wasn't all for nothing.

528
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,350
What? You guys lived together?

529
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:42,396
I even used to hand-wash
this jerk's underwear.

530
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,650
In that shipping container
with no heating.

531
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:51,279
I did that in the middle of winter
and ended up with hand eczema.

532
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,368
Just so Tae-sul could focus
on his research

533
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,037
without having to worry about anything.

534
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:07,254
Hey, you prick.
You'd better be good to me.

535
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,090
He's about to cry.

536
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,300
I'm serious.

537
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,486
-Where are you going?
-A lady over there

538
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,947
keeps staring at me, and I'm curious.

539
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,616
I should go talk to her.

540
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,788
So just enjoy your dinner, you two.

541
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:46,460
Hey, Seung-bok! Eddy Kim.

542
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,837
What was that about?

543
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,928
10 MISSED CALLS
TAE-SAN

544
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,139
Jeez…

545
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,975
Wasn't that your brother earlier?

546
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,019
Yes.

547
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,105
Looks like he got worse
than before he was hospitalized.

548
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,858
Yes, I wonder if it's the alcohol.

549
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,528
He's usually okay
but acts strange when he drinks.

550
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,824
He goes on about the future,
how our phones are tapped, and so on.

551
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,826
He's still like that?

552
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,996
Many people suffer from
stress-induced delusional disorder.

553
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,331
He should get therapy again.

554
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,958
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

555
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:30,629
But it's still nice to have a brother.

556
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,090
I was always so bored
since I'm an only child.

557
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,926
There's nothing nice about it.

558
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,845
It's worse than not having one
since we're so different.

559
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,889
Lately, I'd rather talk to a stranger.

560
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,517
Tae-san thinks that
he practically raised me.

561
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,686
Of course,
I'm grateful for everything he did for me.

562
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,941
But he goes on about what he did for me
and says that I owe it all to him.

563
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,567
That annoys me.

564
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,487
Now that his brother is successful,
I guess he feels

565
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,031
it's unfair that he made
all those sacrifices for me.

566
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,826
That's just your past. It's not you.

567
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,494
Crazy jerk.

568
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,080
-I said, it's not you.
-It is me.

569
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,376
-That prick is me.
-How was I earlier?

570
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,378
I hated him from the beginning.

571
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,006
He's mean and he thinks
he's the most pitiful person in the world.

572
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,175
He thinks he's better than everyone else.

573
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,262
-Stop.
-It's not Sigma's fault.

574
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,724
Because of that jerk,
the nuke went off and killed everyone.

575
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,185
-That is not true.
-I am that jerk!

576
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,036
Tae-sul.

577
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,835
Tae-sul.

578
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,671
Tae-sul!

579
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,758
Tae-sul.

580
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:00,969
Han Tae-sul!

581
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,892
What is this?

582
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,155
Tae-sul, wake up.

583
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,532
Wake up!

584
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,536
Get up. Hey, get up.

585
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,663
Get up already!

586
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,582
Let's go. Come on.

587
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,421
I don't want to see it anymore.

588
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:42,302
Do you know what we'll see
once we walk through that door?

589
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,971
My brother's funeral.

590
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:50,226
And me turning into a rich bastard
who hurts everyone around him.

591
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,690
I've never been happy in my life.

592
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,609
Not even a single day.

593
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:01,988
You can go alone.

594
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,498
How can you not have happy memories?

595
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,167
I lived on rotten canned foods
in a bunker after the war,

596
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,585
but I have happy memories.

597
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,924
After the war,
my dad took me to school every March.

598
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,929
The school was in ruins, but I packed
lunch and my backpack to go there.

599
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,306
It was the one day
I could put my worries to rest

600
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,976
and just play with my dad
in the empty classroom.

601
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,478
And I had so much fun.

602
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:38,817
Right. Once, I went to the stadium
where BTS had their last concert.

603
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,778
There was a huge banner.

604
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,950
My dad and I struggled
to carry it back to our bunker.

605
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,119
It was too big,
so we had to hang it outside.

606
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,499
In the future, the sky is very clear.

607
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,836
There are no lights,
so you can see all the stars at night.

608
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,172
Have you ever seen the Leonids?

609
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,884
Once, I read in a book that

610
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,679
a comet passes through
the constellation Leo every 32 years.

611
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,474
<i>Whenever that happens,
you see a prolific meteor shower.</i>

612
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:16,896
<i>There was one in 1998, so no one
yet saw the meteor shower in 2030.</i>

613
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,274
<i>Except for me.</i>

614
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,527
<i>I saw it all night, on top of the bunker.</i>

615
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,071
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

616
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,618
We all have trivial but happy memories.

617
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,454
That's what keeps us going.

618
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:37,333
I'm sure you have some too.
So try to recall them.

619
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,596
<i>Tae-sul.</i>

620
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,017
<i>Tae-sul!</i>

621
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,374
The sea?

622
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,379
It's the West Sea.

623
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,507
But what point in time?

624
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,678
Over there.

625
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,473
That's my company's training center.

626
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,893
I told them to build it here
because I love this area.

627
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,188
It was scheduled to go up by this year,
and it's all done.

628
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,523
This is the present. We're almost there.

629
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,403
-So what do we do now?
-We'll get the antidote and go back.

630
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,075
Seo-hae, when we go back,

631
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,703
you'll see your dad there.

632
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,789
Really? My dad is there?

633
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,928
How did you bring him over?
Did he believe you? What about Mom?

634
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,096
Yes, he believed everything I told him.

635
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,850
And your mother is waiting for you
at your place.

636
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:44,187
You look just like your mother.

637
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,982
And you obviously got
your personality from your dad.

638
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,947
Thanks for coming to get me.

639
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,499
You should go back first
since you came in here first.

640
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,043
-What about you?
-I'll get the shot after you.

641
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,101
What?

642
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,812
Nothing.

643
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:28,940
I'll begin now.

644
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,335
I feel dizzy.

645
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,214
You should get one too.

646
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,013
What are you doing?

647
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,061
I'm sorry, Seo-hae.

648
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,188
For what?

649
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:22,660
Hey.

650
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,373
I guess it broke along the way.

651
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,714
Listen, Seo-hae.

652
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,594
When you return, you'll wake up
at Asia Mart. You know my place.

653
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,430
You know how to get there, right?
You can stay there.

654
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,224
If you're not sure about anything,
Sun will help you.

655
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,102
-And your parents are there too.
-How could you…

656
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,481
There will be a stranger as well.
That's Kim Seo-jin.

657
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,026
She came from the future
through the uploader, just like you.

658
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,278
She must know some things about Sigma.

659
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,405
Seo-hae.

660
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,201
You have to catch Sigma.

661
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,828
You can do it.

662
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,044
I've been racking my smart brain,

663
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,672
and you should be the one who goes back.

664
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:20,593
They need you more than me
to save the world.

665
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,846
No one's waiting

666
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,557
for me to come back anyway.

667
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,186
You know that everyone hates me.

668
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:36,901
Seo-hae.

669
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,489
Stop being so serious all the time.

670
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,702
Laugh and smile more often.

671
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,480
What about Tae-sul?

672
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,526
What happened?

673
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,448
We only had one vial.

674
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,754
You jerk.

675
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,257
Can you hear me?

676
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,928
You can hear my voice, right?

677
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,099
Wake up.

678
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,019
Wake up at once.

679
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:21,023
I will kill you. Wake up!

680
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:26,195
<i>How could you say
no one's waiting for you?</i>

681
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,283
I'm waiting for you.

682
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,160
Wake up.

683
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:36,247
I said, wake up!

684
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:44,005
You fool, wake up.

685
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,176
You're not going to die today.

686
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,028
You woke up.

687
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,072
Tae-san?

688
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,458
I told you

689
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,711
that we'd meet again.

690
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,964
Tae-sul, over here!

691
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,598
Pass me the ball. Over here!

692
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,063
What happened?

693
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:47,234
We share the same past
because we're brothers.

694
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,323
I told you I'd be hiding in a place
where no one could find.

695
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,287
So you were here all this time?

696
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,985
Tae-sul.

697
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:32,780
Tae-san.

698
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:38,911
I'm sorry. It was all my fault.
I'm sorry for everything.

699
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:45,835
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

700
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,839
I said it's okay.

701
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,759
I'm so sorry.

702
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,553
I'm sorry…

703
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:59,098
Hey, why are you sorry?

704
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,142
I should be the one saying sorry.

705
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:06,480
I should've been a better brother to you.
I'm really sorry.

706
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:13,779
I'm so proud of you
for everything you've accomplished.

707
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,239
Thank you.

708
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,493
Tae-san…

709
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,122
Oh, right.

710
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:30,379
I brought this with me
in case I'd need it.

711
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,716
I guess now's the time.

712
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:38,679
Tae-san.

713
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,599
Hold on.

714
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,146
Tae-san.

715
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:53,402
Tae-sul, listen carefully.

716
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,406
You shouldn't be here.

717
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:03,162
Well, I think this will be the last time
we see each other.

718
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,374
We won't cross paths like this again.

719
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,753
Tae-sul, you have to remember this.

720
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,422
Even when you couldn't see me,

721
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:17,426
I was always right by your side.

722
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,513
And that won't change.

723
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:25,309
So when you're lonely, stressed,
or exhausted,

724
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,730
just look around you, and I'll be there.

725
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,319
Now, get going.

726
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,198
I love you.

727
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,615
I've come a long way to meet you.

728
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,744
It was such a difficult
and terrifying journey.

729
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,872
Please wake up.

730
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,166
You're smart.

731
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,212
You can do anything, so please…

732
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,632
Figure out a way to come back.

733
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,014
I miss you.

734
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,185
Tae-sul.

735
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,401
Did you just say

736
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,988
you miss me?

737
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,660
Have you lost your mind? Got a death wish?

738
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:34,581
No, I don't want to die. Sorry.

739
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,418
I thought you were dead!

740
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,220
<i>You owe me a debt.</i>

741
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:14,014
<i>I can change the future.
And it's already changing.</i>

742
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,725
<i>Then get rid of the uploader.</i>

743
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,019
-If you get rid of the person who made--
-Hey.

744
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,606
<i>You total scumbag.</i>

745
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,817
<i>Did he leave us this drawing on purpose?</i>

746
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,069
<i>But the drawing's a bit strange.</i>

747
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:29,238
<i>Everything started here.</i>

748
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:32,616
<i>We found the suspect.
We got the location of Han Tae-sul.</i>

749
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:35,369
<i>-Who drew these?
-There's no name.</i>

750
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:38,288
<i>Han Tae-sul!</i>

751
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,082
It's him.

752
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:45,421
