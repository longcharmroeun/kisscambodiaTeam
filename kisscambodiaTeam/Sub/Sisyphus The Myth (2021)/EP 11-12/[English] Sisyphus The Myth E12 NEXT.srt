1
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:13,121
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,480
Is this the wrong way?

3
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:24,254
That hurt…

4
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:55,650
I came the right way.

5
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,056
This is so exhausting.

6
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,960
I'm hungry…

7
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:29,243
Achasan…

8
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:33,414
ACHASAN ECOLOGICAL PARK

9
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:34,915
Achasan…

10
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,675
Which way is it?

11
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:47,720
Found it!

12
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:59,023
It's too far to take a detour.

13
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:20,206
Seo-hae!

14
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,751
Mom?

15
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:26,378
Gang Seo-hae!

16
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,590
-Seo-hae!
-Mom?

17
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:31,008
Seo-hae!

18
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,393
Gang Seo-hae!

19
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,076
Hold my hand!

20
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,547
It's okay now.

21
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:56,385
It's okay.

22
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,178
-Dad…
-It's all right.

23
00:08:58,262 --> 00:08:59,638
It's okay now.

24
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:01,640
You're safe.

25
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,064
It's all right.

26
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:46,268
You should steer clear of sand.

27
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,813
Always follow the paths. I told you that.

28
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:51,732
Right.

29
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:54,318
And I told you to rest
if you're exhausted,

30
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,236
to make sure you can see ahead,

31
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,989
and to take the safe route
even if it takes longer.

32
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,493
-Right.
-But you didn't do as I told you.

33
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:13,545
You can't get to the uploader by yourself.

34
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,093
Seo-hae.

35
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:24,306
I want you to have a comfortable life.

36
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:27,685
Let's smuggle ourselves
out of the country.

37
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:30,354
No.

38
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:33,982
I made a promise to your mother. Please.

39
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,783
You brat…

40
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,830
Take this.

41
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,592
If you want to get to the uploader,
you'll have to shoot me first.

42
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:02,886
Dad!

43
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:06,265
-What?
-This isn't like you.

44
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:08,142
What are you so scared of?

45
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,937
I'm scared
that you might suffer, get hurt,

46
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:18,193
and die.

47
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:22,948
I'm not scared.

48
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:26,994
I'm only scared of giving up
before trying anything.

49
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,749
I can do it. I'm going to do it.

50
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,585
It's something only I can do.

51
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,175
I can't get to the uploader by myself.

52
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,844
I need your help, Dad.

53
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:49,933
Please.

54
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:54,146
I want to go to the past.

55
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:25,921
I MISS YOU, MOM

56
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,339
GOODBYE, MY FRIEND

57
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:32,135
SLEEP WELL, MY DAUGHTER

58
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:40,060
GOODBYE, BROTHER

59
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,103
Seo-hae, promise me

60
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,690
that you'll take care of yourself first
over there.

61
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,276
Dad.

62
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:33,238
And come find me
if something happens, okay?

63
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:36,116
Okay.

64
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,665
You'll need a lot of valuables
to get on the uploader.

65
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,500
And you have to pay the brokers.

66
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:50,964
They say people sell them for money
to settle down in the past.

67
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,635
Things like weapons or medicine
that doesn't exist in the past.

68
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,929
Dad, that's…

69
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,390
This will be enough for one person.

70
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:02,976
What about you?

71
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:53,860
How long have they been following us?

72
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:55,445
For two days.

73
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:06,373
State your names.

74
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:14,965
Your names!

75
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,344
Seo-hae. Gang Seo-hae.

76
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,138
Why do you want to take the uploader?

77
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,474
Answer me!

78
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,185
To stop the war.

79
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:28,812
How?

80
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,981
I just need to save one person.

81
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,024
Who?

82
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,362
Who?

83
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:45,996
Han Tae-sul.

84
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:49,916
Han Tae-sul?

85
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:54,880
-Tae-san.
-Han Tae-sul!

86
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:56,339
Han Tae-sul! Get down!

87
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:00,177
I said, get down!

88
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,274
So it was you.

89
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:45,430
Dad.

90
00:18:22,175 --> 00:18:23,343
Dad.

91
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:39,693
This.

92
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:44,990
I got this scar when I fell from a bike.

93
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,741
When I was eight.

94
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:51,705
It's not that I doubt you.

95
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:56,960
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit confused.

96
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,855
You look the same as you did
when you were a kid.

97
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:18,982
You look like your mother.

98
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:22,152
You always said that.

99
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,487
And you're quite tall.

100
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:29,701
Your mother used to give you
herbal medicine to make you grow taller.

101
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,621
She'd be so happy to see you.

102
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,838
Here. This is how to get to the bunker.

103
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:44,883
I don't know who made it and why,

104
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,969
but a war breaks out on October 31.

105
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:51,389
So you and I lived there for 15 years.

106
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:57,354
BUNKER UNDER THE BRIDGE

107
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,065
What about your mother?

108
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:02,942
She…

109
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,499
If we knew about the war,

110
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,627
why didn't we leave the country
beforehand?

111
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,171
We can't.

112
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:27,050
People don't know it yet,
but the airports don't let us leave.

113
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:31,471
If the Control Bureau puts you
on the watch list, you can't leave.

114
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:38,645
You kept the promise you made to Mom.

115
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:42,399
You promised to keep me safe.

116
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,027
I did get injured here and there,

117
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,155
but it's only because
I kept going to dangerous places.

118
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,992
But I survived and grew up healthy.

119
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:00,250
I know what you're going to say.

120
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,837
You want to ask me
why I came to the past, right?

121
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:06,715
Because you wouldn't have let me go.

122
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:08,967
You're right.

123
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,428
But you did.

124
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:13,930
Thank you.

125
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:16,808
I tried fruit as you told me to.

126
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,935
Real fruit, not canned ones.

127
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:22,063
I even went to an amusement park,
and I met Mom.

128
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:26,484
And I met so many good people.

129
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,862
They don't try to steal what I have.

130
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:33,241
They get upset when I get hurt,
and risk their lives to save me.

131
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,996
I can do well on my own now.

132
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,290
And I'm not alone anymore.

133
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,544
I'll make sure
those people don't get hurt.

134
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:46,838
I'll make sure they can complain

135
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:50,258
about everyday life
without knowing anything about a war.

136
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,304
I'll change everything.

137
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,139
I can do it.

138
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,746
<i>So when you're lonely,</i>

139
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:22,582
stressed, or exhausted,

140
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:26,127
just look around you, and I'll be there.

141
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:30,340
I love you.

142
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:37,931
Hey! Mr. Han!

143
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:42,769
How does it feel to come back to life?

144
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:45,563
It feels great.

145
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,651
My entire life flashed before my eyes.

146
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:54,656
I felt that I should live kindly.

147
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:58,743
You should try it
when you have the chance.

148
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:02,080
No, thanks. I've committed too many sins.

149
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:04,499
My brother…

150
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:09,629
What have you done to him?

151
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,465
You promised to tell me. Come on.

152
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,391
All right.

153
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:24,602
Your brother Tae-san

154
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:29,732
was caught and tortured by Sigma.

155
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:33,653
Sigma took his key
and found out where his safe was.

156
00:23:33,736 --> 00:23:35,738
And Agnes,
who worked for the Control Bureau,

157
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:40,702
took the opportunity to smuggle
your brother out,

158
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:42,287
along with the key.

159
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,208
So you're saying you were
all in on it together?

160
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,460
Sigma, Seo-jin, and the Control Bureau?

161
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:52,130
Don't say it like that.
We just have a complex…

162
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,799
Well, I guess I could say
it's a business relationship.

163
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:59,178
Anyway, after that,

164
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:01,681
I stole your brother from Agnes.

165
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:04,142
Then I offered him a deal.

166
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:09,897
I promised him that I'd protect you,
Han Tae-sul,

167
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,066
if he got me that key.

168
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,653
So you told him to come back
through the uploader once he got the key?

169
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:18,031
That's right.

170
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:24,245
Oh, don't you remember
our first phone call?

171
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:28,875
In Gimpo.

172
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:36,299
<i>Mr. Han Tae-san.</i>

173
00:24:40,303 --> 00:24:42,764
Did you bring the key?

174
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:45,308
<i>Yes, I have the key.</i>

175
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:49,395
Are your limbs all there?

176
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:52,315
<i>-What?</i>
-Are your limbs all intact?

177
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:57,153
-Yes.
-Good. Your health is most important.

178
00:24:57,236 --> 00:25:00,990
All right. Let's meet. Bring the key.

179
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,826
<i>Where should I go?</i>

180
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,703
We'll come pick you up.

181
00:25:06,412 --> 00:25:08,581
Where are you now?

182
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,751
I'm at an acquaintance's house.

183
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:14,879
An acquaintance?

184
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,926
You said your limbs are all intact, right?

185
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:21,135
<i>Yes.</i>

186
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:23,554
But let me ask you something.

187
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:27,183
What's the number written
on your right arm?

188
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:34,982
Hey.

189
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:38,403
You're not Han Tae-san, are you?

190
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:44,951
Hey. Go get him.

191
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:46,452
Hurry up.

192
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:51,541
But Han Tae-san got caught by Sigma again.

193
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,794
Then Agnes was afraid that

194
00:25:54,877 --> 00:25:59,006
Sigma might get his hands on
the uploader blueprint Tae-san had.

195
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,802
So she ended up injecting your brother
with the drug.

196
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:05,430
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I was told not to.

197
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:12,603
Anyway, the deal was that
Han Tae-san would get me the key,

198
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:15,189
and in return,

199
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,818
I'd provide
support and protection for you.

200
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:20,570
That's it.

201
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,450
Hey, you're here.

202
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:29,245
But did your father leave?

203
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,458
Her father seemed to have quite a temper,
didn't he?

204
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,376
I guess personalities are hereditary.

205
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,671
Let's go. I feel nervous staying here.

206
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:42,341
But I still have something left
to do here.

207
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:46,512
What are you two whispering about?

208
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,728
I helped save your girlfriend,
so you fix this now.

209
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,899
Hey. Do you have a flash drive?

210
00:26:57,982 --> 00:26:59,358
A flash drive…

211
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:02,487
-A USB flash drive.
-Right. Yes, I do.

212
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,363
What's he telling you to fix?

213
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:07,408
I broke his downloader.

214
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,843
But you know,

215
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,180
I can't really trust you.

216
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:34,977
How can I trust you to let us go
in one piece after I give you this?

217
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:39,607
All right. Then I'll just kill you all

218
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:41,234
and take it.

219
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:45,446
Bingbing! Come over here.

220
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,118
Sis! Are you all right?

221
00:27:52,078 --> 00:27:52,912
What about you?

222
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:56,040
I'm not all right.

223
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:58,876
Stand up straight.

224
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,129
Stop hitting me, will you?

225
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,713
Be quiet, you jerks.

226
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:06,259
Come on.

227
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,097
I locked it with a passcode.

228
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:16,681
You're trying to play tricks, are you?

229
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:19,772
Is that so? Shoot his hand.

230
00:28:20,314 --> 00:28:22,733
-Just give it to him.
-What?

231
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:25,528
Just give it to him. It's okay.

232
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:27,822
Well, I'm not okay with it.

233
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:29,574
I'll take care of this.

234
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:34,120
Come on. Give it to me.

235
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,044
Right. The passcode.

236
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,716
-One.
-And?

237
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:49,719
Eight, one, eight.

238
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:54,599
Wow. What a simple passcode.

239
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,644
Bingbing!

240
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:04,609
Put this in and fix it.

241
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:11,240
Is it working or not?

242
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,951
I'm working on it!
I just rebooted the system.

243
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:15,369
I didn't even put it in yet.

244
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,163
Hurry up.

245
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:28,049
It's working.

246
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:31,761
Then can we go home now?

247
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,555
It was nice meeting you.

248
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,939
Darn it! I knew you'd do this.

249
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:44,440
What are you doing?

250
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:51,989
You owe me a debt.

251
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,284
I was taken to the Control Bureau.

252
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:59,664
That kid was shot,
and he got crippled for life.

253
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:04,085
Whose fault do you think that is?

254
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:09,006
Why are you blaming me?
You're in charge of your own life.

255
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,716
Stop this.

256
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,552
You said it's all predestined.

257
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:15,346
Getting taken to the Control Bureau

258
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,848
and not seeing your family
must be your destiny.

259
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:20,685
So why are you taking it out on me?

260
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,021
Taking it out on you? That's cute.

261
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:26,357
Right.

262
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:32,321
I'm angry
because I can't do anything about it.

263
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:37,243
I'm furious because it's all fixed!

264
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:41,247
Do you feel better if you say that?

265
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:47,128
Do you say that it's impossible to
change things in case you fail to do it?

266
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:48,629
You're just making an excuse.

267
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:56,887
But too bad. Let me tell you something.

268
00:30:58,014 --> 00:30:59,598
Some things have already changed.

269
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,852
Seon-jae!

270
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:09,358
<i>I was supposed to get shot.</i>

271
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:13,738
It was written in my diary
that I'd be crippled after getting shot.

272
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:19,493
Give this to your brother.

273
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:23,956
-They're stem cells.
-What's that?

274
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,709
They can fix his legs.
They're not fully developed yet now.

275
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,421
You might be too cowardly to do it,
but I can change the future.

276
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:32,048
And it's already changing.

277
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,092
So shoot me if you want to.

278
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:40,181
Let's go.

279
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:03,496
I'm furious because I can't change things
that are predestined!

280
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:09,627
Seo-hae! You were so cool!

281
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:13,381
-But how are you feeling? Are you okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

282
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:15,091
Gang Seo-hae.

283
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:22,014
What you said back there, is it true?
Was that bullet meant for you?

284
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:25,267
-Yes.
-Why didn't you tell me?

285
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:28,020
Then you knew about
getting taken to the Control Bureau?

286
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:30,231
What else have you been hiding from me?

287
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:32,233
I don't know everything.

288
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:34,985
-What do you know then?
-Why are you so upset?

289
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,446
What's with you all of a sudden?

290
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:39,323
You're hurting me.

291
00:33:10,646 --> 00:33:11,981
Seon-jae.

292
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,039
Are you feeling okay?

293
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:52,396
I sometimes have a certain dream.

294
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,858
I saw a grave.

295
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:57,943
It was my grave.

296
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,197
That's where I found my diary.

297
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,244
Then I touched something.

298
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,207
I've been having that dream since then.

299
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:13,250
What dream is it?

300
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:17,004
It's about what's going to happen.

301
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:23,219
Yes.

302
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,556
On the last day,
I was in some kind of a church.

303
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:32,102
We were wearing wedding outfits,

304
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,188
and I got shot.

305
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,859
Sigma told you to choose.

306
00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:45,407
<i>-Mr. Han Tae-sul?</i>
-Are you Sigma?

307
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:50,538
Is it the girl or the world? Pick one.

308
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,625
Choosing between you and

309
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,210
the world.

310
00:34:58,087 --> 00:34:59,129
How did you know?

311
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:01,423
I met Sigma

312
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:03,592
while you were asleep.

313
00:35:04,677 --> 00:35:05,636
What did he say?

314
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:07,763
He told me to make the uploader.

315
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:14,937
That's why I told you not to find Sigma.

316
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,608
You have to choose between the two.

317
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,362
-And last time…
-I made the uploader, right?

318
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:27,408
If you face that situation again,

319
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:30,119
don't make the uploader.

320
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,329
Even if you do,

321
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:35,916
I'll die anyway.

322
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,042
No.

323
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:40,004
I have another chance now.

324
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,755
We'll just all die again.

325
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,426
What happens to you
if I don't make the uploader?

326
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,430
Without the uploader,

327
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:52,558
nobody would be able
to come from the future.

328
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,894
-Then you--
-Promise me

329
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:58,981
you won't make it.

330
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,224
See all this money?

331
00:36:34,808 --> 00:36:36,644
I ordered water.

332
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,521
If it arrives, put it in the basement.
I wrote down a list.

333
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:44,777
Medicine and guns.
Just buy all the guns you find.

334
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,739
Gas masks, hazmat suits, salt, sugar,
canned food, and chocolate. Got that?

335
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:50,532
What about <i>ramyeon</i>?

336
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:53,535
No, the smell is too strong.
It'll attract everyone.

337
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:57,831
Oh, and get lots of jerky.

338
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,042
-We already have enough.
-We do?

339
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:02,711
Anyway, we can't leave
for several months this time.

340
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:04,546
So buy everything you can.

341
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,883
And if there's any money left,
bring it back.

342
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:10,177
-Where are you going?
-Somewhere.

343
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,470
-Where?
-Somewhere!

344
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:12,763
Don't forget anything.

345
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:26,276
Hey. I heard Mr. Park survived
because he was in jail.

346
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,653
I heard it myself yesterday.

347
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,155
-I already knew that.
-Me too.

348
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,032
I know you didn't know.

349
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:33,701
I did.

350
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:37,162
-Why was he in jail, then?
-He killed someone.

351
00:37:37,246 --> 00:37:39,581
Really? He's a total scumbag then.

352
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,625
You didn't know that?

353
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:46,088
-Who did he kill?
-I don't know.

354
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:48,590
Darn it.

355
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:50,801
He's pretty secretive
about his personal life.

356
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:15,909
Goodness.

357
00:38:17,536 --> 00:38:19,329
Nothing has changed.

358
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,794
I'm going to jump!

359
00:38:29,923 --> 00:38:31,049
Have you lost your mind?

360
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,056
Who's the jerk that sends you
three million won every month?

361
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,433
I told you, I don't know!

362
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:43,937
Are you having an affair with him?

363
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,105
What?

364
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:48,567
-Are you crazy?
-Am I crazy?

365
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:54,281
You total scumbag.

366
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:59,495
You should be working hard instead of
beating up your wife like a loser.

367
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:02,039
You need to learn a lesson.

368
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:08,337
I'll teach you a lesson, you jerk.

369
00:39:13,926 --> 00:39:16,637
What crazy asshole threw a rock at me?

370
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,931
If I catch you, you're dead!

371
00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:21,809
Darn it. This is all your fault!

372
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:29,399
What are you doing?

373
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:32,110
Just getting some fresh air.

374
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:36,365
I heard you did a good job
at the Control Bureau. Thanks.

375
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,035
No, it's nothing. I didn't do much.

376
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:42,412
I just ran around
and stayed there as a hostage.

377
00:39:42,496 --> 00:39:45,874
But I was really scared
that you wouldn't come back.

378
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:52,047
About that last day, is it true?

379
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,341
Did you eavesdrop?

380
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:57,177
No, I just overheard from the other room.

381
00:39:57,845 --> 00:40:01,515
Honestly, I don't get anything
about the uploader, downloader, or war.

382
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:09,356
What if you leave the country with me?

383
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,943
Then nothing will happen to you, right?

384
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,445
I told you. I can't leave.

385
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:17,322
Why? Because of Han Tae-sul?

386
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:20,534
Did something happen between you two?

387
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:23,662
Darn it. I knew it.

388
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:26,039
Jae-sun.

389
00:40:31,336 --> 00:40:32,462
Over there.

390
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:36,300
What? The Hangang Bridge?

391
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:38,927
My house was there. A bunker below it.

392
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:41,555
So you had a river view.

393
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:44,016
The river was all dried up.

394
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:45,517
No way.

395
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:49,980
Everything you see over there
is going to burn and crumble down.

396
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:52,399
I'm not staying because of someone.

397
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:54,610
I'm staying because I want to.

398
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:56,528
Then let me ask you something.

399
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:59,573
Why does the war break out?

400
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,868
Sigma explodes a nuclear bomb.

401
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:04,786
But he came here through the uploader.

402
00:41:05,704 --> 00:41:08,457
-Right.
-Then get rid of the uploader.

403
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,793
-If you get rid of the person who made--
-Hey.

404
00:41:15,464 --> 00:41:18,008
You're not acting like yourself.

405
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:19,593
You never hesitate to do things.

406
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,221
Sis.

407
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:26,725
You like Han Tae-sul, right?

408
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:40,697
-Why?
-I feel uncomfortable.

409
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:43,283
You can't do this so suddenly.

410
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,498
Oh, I only brought two cups.

411
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:52,626
Do you want one?

412
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:00,342
What's with him?

413
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:15,023
There's something I didn't tell you.

414
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,735
I told you I met Sigma, right?

415
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,907
And it felt like he knew me.

416
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:28,286
-What do you mean?
-He asked me

417
00:42:28,787 --> 00:42:30,372
if I remembered him.

418
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:32,874
So I tried to recall him,

419
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:36,920
but I can't remember him at all.

420
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:40,173
He could have just been bluffing.

421
00:42:40,716 --> 00:42:41,967
I'm not sure.

422
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:44,636
What's "bluffing"?

423
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,224
Hey.

424
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:51,935
Bluffing is like acting tough.

425
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:56,148
Pretending to have something
when you don't have anything.

426
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,485
That's what you always do.
You pretend to know everything.

427
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:03,697
Hey, that's different.
I really do know everything.

428
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,073
You're so ridiculous.

429
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,165
Do I really…

430
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,961
have to choose between you and the world?

431
00:43:18,837 --> 00:43:20,672
I hate stuff like that.

432
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:25,469
I hate making choices. I always order
everything on the menu at a restaurant.

433
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:27,137
Stop joking around.

434
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,722
Fine.

435
00:43:31,558 --> 00:43:36,271
It's just that
I don't exactly know how I feel.

436
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:40,817
I know that I should kill Sigma
and stop the war,

437
00:43:41,777 --> 00:43:44,988
but you'll disappear if I do.

438
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:51,411
I'd hate that.

439
00:44:49,511 --> 00:44:50,846
What could it be?

440
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:55,433
Did he know that we were going
to go to that house?

441
00:44:57,853 --> 00:44:58,687
Did he

442
00:44:59,938 --> 00:45:01,898
leave us this drawing on purpose?

443
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,318
But the drawing's a bit strange.

444
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,112
Strange? How?

445
00:45:12,784 --> 00:45:13,994
This part.

446
00:45:15,328 --> 00:45:17,163
The buildings don't exist in the future.

447
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:09,424
What's this?

448
00:46:09,507 --> 00:46:10,592
Sorry?

449
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,427
This.

450
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:27,150
Hang on. I've seen this before.

451
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,955
I didn't know
why Tae-san was carrying these around.

452
00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:42,165
I saw the drawing when I was little,

453
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,377
and Sigma seemed to know me.

454
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:50,090
So he and I must have met before.

455
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:51,466
WOOHYUNG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

456
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:54,636
So he's in one of those?

457
00:46:55,387 --> 00:46:56,304
Yes.

458
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:00,058
We'll have to check all the photos, then.

459
00:47:00,976 --> 00:47:03,895
-But are you okay with this?
-What do you mean?

460
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:05,647
You may want to hide your ugly past.

461
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,984
Hey, you even know
how to make jokes like that?

462
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:10,360
Who taught you?

463
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,738
I guess it was Jae-sun.

464
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:17,033
-Shut up.
-I don't have an ugly past.

465
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:19,494
I was born perfect.

466
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:22,706
All right. Fine.

469
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:54,738
What?

470
00:47:56,781 --> 00:47:58,450
What is it? Did you find him?

471
00:47:58,533 --> 00:48:00,035
No…

472
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,792
This girl. She used to have a crush on me.

473
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:12,964
I remember her. Song Ji-hye.

474
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:16,718
She made me 100 origami frogs, you know.

475
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,389
She's pretty. I guess you can ask her
to protect you now.

476
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:25,226
Come on, don't say stuff like that.

477
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,227
What?

478
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:28,938
That's enough, Seo-hae.

479
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:36,404
Wait a second.
You know, I've been thinking

480
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:37,572
scientifically.

481
00:48:38,823 --> 00:48:42,494
I've been thinking scientifically
about that day.

482
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:46,706
The things that happened

483
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,376
while we were wandering
through time and space

484
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:53,213
weren't fixed events.

485
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:55,757
But I concluded that it was real.

486
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:58,885
What do you mean?

487
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:01,387
What we did at the beach…

488
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:05,850
<i>We…</i>

489
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:11,648
Hey. We only did that
because we thought it was the end.

490
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:13,900
What?

491
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,487
We were just saying goodbye.

492
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,073
Hang on.

493
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,327
Is that how you say goodbye in the future?

494
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:28,540
Are you all that passionate?
Do you have a different culture?

495
00:49:28,623 --> 00:49:32,377
Or are you treating me like this
because I'm someone from the past?

496
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,506
-You said you're a misogamist.
-What does that have to do with this?

497
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:38,842
Do you even know what "misogamist" means?

498
00:49:41,094 --> 00:49:42,178
Hey.

There's no name.

507
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:58,922
-Don't you have another one?
-Who'd keep two of these stuff?

508
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:01,925
Right.

DREAM JOB: A WRITER
FAVORITE COLOR: PURPLE

516
00:51:48,846 --> 00:51:52,141
You like pink, don't you?

517
00:51:53,434 --> 00:51:55,812
-Why do you ask?
-I mean…

518
00:51:56,854 --> 00:51:59,065
Your diary was pink, your gun was pink,

519
00:51:59,148 --> 00:52:02,026
and all the little accessories were pink.

520
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:06,990
There are only about 72 hours left
until the war breaks out.

521
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,034
But that's all I know

522
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,371
about you.

523
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:19,502
I've wasted my whole life
on useless things.

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,257
There's no time left.

526
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,347
My favorite food is bulgogi.

527
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,434
I already noticed that at the sauna.

528
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:36,394
And yours is <i>tonkatsu</i>.

529
00:52:37,061 --> 00:52:39,022

asking such questions?

00:53:32,784 --> 00:53:34,744
Checking your old student record?

541
00:53:34,827 --> 00:53:37,955
Please write your name
and year of graduation here.

542
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:41,334
Well, I didn't graduate here.

543
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:43,169
Then write the year you entered.

544
00:53:46,047 --> 00:53:49,801
HAN TAE-SUL

545
00:53:51,219 --> 00:53:53,596
-"Han Tae-sul"?
-Yes.

546
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:55,098
The Han Tae-sul?

547
00:53:56,265 --> 00:53:59,185
Oh, my goodness! I'm such a big fan!

548
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:02,021
You look much more handsome in person.

549
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,815
-Thank you.
-I'm…

550
00:54:03,898 --> 00:54:06,442
I mean,
the students in my class are huge fans.

551
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:11,280
At our science drawing contest,
everyone drew you fixing the plane.

552
00:54:11,364 --> 00:54:14,617
Their dream jobs are all scientists now.

553
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,910
Is that so?

554
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:18,079
I thought only your brain was sexy,

555
00:54:18,162 --> 00:54:21,082
but so is your mind and body as well.

556
00:54:21,165 --> 00:54:24,961
Wow, that's a unique expression.

557
00:54:25,461 --> 00:54:26,712
My goodness.

558
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:28,589
Hey, we don't have time.

559
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:33,803
-One of the students from 1991…
-Are you his girlfriend?

560
00:54:33,886 --> 00:54:35,680
-No.
-Yes.

561
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:43,521
Could I take a photo with you?

562
00:54:43,604 --> 00:54:45,898
-Of course.
-Thank you.

563
00:54:47,775 --> 00:54:51,279
-Please don't upload it online, though.
-Oh, right.

564
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:52,738
I won't.

565
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:56,075
I can't believe this.
All right. One, two, three.

566
00:54:57,326 --> 00:55:00,621
My goodness. Thank you so much.
I'll go find it right away.

567
00:55:00,705 --> 00:55:03,666
No, it's fine.
Can I just go find it myself?

568
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:06,627
-Why…
-Well,

569
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:09,130
I'm not so confident about my old photos.

570
00:55:09,213 --> 00:55:11,090
All right. Feel free to do so.

571
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,384
Thank you. Where's the archive room?

572
00:55:13,468 --> 00:55:15,553
The end of the hallway
on the second floor.

573
00:55:15,636 --> 00:55:17,096
All right.

574
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,223
Thank you.

575
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:52,423
Be quiet.

576
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:57,386
If you do that one more time, you're dead.

577
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:31,754
We found the suspect.
We got the location of Han Tae-sul.

578
00:56:36,008 --> 00:56:37,802
-What about the girl?
-She's with him.

579
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:39,428
It's 20 minutes away.

580
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,811
Is it here?

581
00:56:46,894 --> 00:56:47,895
Yes.

582

00:56:57,296 --> 00:56:59,465
-Which class were you in?
-Class Four.

584
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,679
Do it gently, will you?

585
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:06,055
Just hurry up and find it.

586
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,516
What's with you?

587
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:13,375
"I thought only your brain was sexy,

588
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:16,479
but so is your mind and body as well."

589
00:57:16,627 --> 00:57:20,130
-Is that what this is about?
-You were totally enjoying it.

590
00:57:21,529 --> 00:57:25,408
Hey, I had to win her favor
to get in here.

591

HAN TAE-SUL

592

Han Tae-sul.

593
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:37,041
"He has good grades
but isn't focused in class.

594
00:57:37,066 --> 00:57:40,486
He's selfish and lacks consideration
for his classmates."

595
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:43,997
-Is that really written there?
-You're still the same.

596
00:57:44,112 --> 00:57:46,740
"Very bright yet lacks social abilities.

597
00:57:47,972 --> 00:57:51,267
Needs more guidance
in participating in group activities."

598
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,769
Hang on.

<i>Tae-sul!</i>

Tae-sul!

602
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:14,515
Han Tae-sul! It's me, Seo Won-ju!

603
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:18,144
Hey! Han Tae-sul!

604
00:58:24,817 --> 00:58:25,985
Yes.

605
00:58:28,779 --> 00:58:29,614
It's him.

606
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,455
<i>You dung fly!</i>

607
00:58:37,538 --> 00:58:39,957
<i>-You disgusting dung fly!
-You dung fly!</i>

608
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,835
<i>-You dung fly!
-You dung fly!</i>

609
00:58:43,513 --> 00:58:46,433
You dung fly.
I told you to stay away from me.

610
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,626
Gross!

611
00:58:47,695 --> 00:58:50,614
Are you borrowing books from the library
to spread your germs?

612
00:58:51,218 --> 00:58:53,596
<i>Lord of the Flies</i>?
You always read books like this.

613
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:54,965
That's so disgusting.

614
00:58:55,018 --> 00:58:56,811
He got his spit all over that.

615
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,161
My mom told me that he spreads rabies.

616
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:01,938
Your dad sells dog meat, right?

617
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:04,732
-Gross!
-You dung fly!

618
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:07,526
Rabies can't be spread between people.

619
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:12,531
And <i>Lord of the Flies</i> isn't about insects.

620
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:15,896
It's on our recommended book list.
Haven't you read it?

621
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:19,488
Who's this jerk?

622
00:59:19,997 --> 00:59:22,166
It was Han something.

623
00:59:22,249 --> 00:59:24,919
-Han Tae-sul.
-You knew how to talk?

624
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:29,244
You were staring at the sky all the time,
so I thought you couldn't speak.

625
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:32,186
We'll let you go since you have
good grades. So get lost.

626
00:59:32,718 --> 00:59:33,594
I can't do that.

627
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:37,139
I'm in charge of the library books
this week.

628
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:38,891
I have to get borrowed books back.

629
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,435
You stupid orphan.
Do you have a death wish?

630
00:59:42,853 --> 00:59:43,688
What's this?

631
00:59:44,438 --> 00:59:47,483
Sodium and water. Try mixing them.

632
00:59:54,306 --> 00:59:55,808
Mix them.

633
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:15,059
Get lost
before I explode something bigger.

634
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,850
He really mixed it
just because I told him to?

635
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:23,144
We just learned that in science class.

636
01:00:23,227 --> 01:00:25,479
We were told to be careful
since it could explode.

637
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:27,635
Thanks.

638
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:31,241
For what? I was just reviewing
what we learned today.

639
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:43,998
Return it by tomorrow.

640
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:46,625
Don't forget.

641
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:13,069
Your dad's here!

642
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:18,324
-You brat!
-He's sleeping.

643
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:20,826
Aren't you greeting your dad,
you little jerk?

644
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,914
-Hey! Come out here! You brat.
-What's with you?

645
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:27,917
-Jeez.
-Stop drinking, will you?

646
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,252
-Hey!
-Stop it!

647
01:01:30,336 --> 01:01:33,714
Did you lock the door? Open up!

648
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:36,467
Can't you hear me? Open up, you brat!

649
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,219
You little brat!

650
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:40,471
-Don't do this.
-You useless jerk. Get up!

651
01:01:40,554 --> 01:01:42,973
-You little… Come over here!
-Stop it!

652
01:01:43,057 --> 01:01:45,309
You're dead!

653
01:02:11,252 --> 01:02:12,086
What's that?

654
01:02:14,547 --> 01:02:18,300
I bet you're going to become
someone great when you grow up.

655
01:02:19,093 --> 01:02:20,636
How would you know that?

656
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,722
I can see the future.

657
01:02:24,348 --> 01:02:27,476
The things I draw
always happen in real life.

658
01:02:28,727 --> 01:02:31,856
You're going to save the world.

659
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:33,774
I saw it.

660
01:02:37,278 --> 01:02:39,280
-What is it?
-You don't have to know.

661
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:41,198
You're always drawing pictures.

662
01:02:41,282 --> 01:02:43,450
-It's not a drawing.
-Then what is it?

663
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,328
-It's a blueprint.
-A blueprint for what?

664
01:02:50,457 --> 01:02:51,917
Oh, for traveling in time?

665
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,879
Yes. I can't do it now,
but when I grow up,

666
01:02:54,962 --> 01:02:57,131
I'm going to make one for real.

667
01:02:57,214 --> 01:03:00,467
Cool. Then can you go to the future, too?

668
01:03:00,551 --> 01:03:03,179
No. Only to the past.

669
01:03:03,262 --> 01:03:07,308
Why? Isn't it boring to go to the past?
You already know what happened.

670
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:09,059
I'm going to go to the past.

671
01:03:12,897 --> 01:03:13,939
Tae-sul.

672
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:20,112
If you really succeed
in making a time machine,

673
01:03:21,614 --> 01:03:23,699
can I ride it first?

674
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,540
-Jeez!
-Darn it!

675
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:35,461
-Darn it!
-If I see you again, you're dead.

676
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:39,006
-That jerk.
-He's so annoying!

677
01:03:39,089 --> 01:03:41,800
-Darn it!
-Hey, let's go.

678
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,223
-Does anyone still bully you?
-No.

679
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:49,808
-That's nice.
-Yes.

680
01:03:51,644 --> 01:03:55,689
By the way, where did you get that bruise?

681
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:56,857
What?

682
01:04:04,114 --> 01:04:05,241
Hey…

683
01:04:05,824 --> 01:04:09,161
Can you teach me that thing
from last time? The explosion.

684
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,914
-Why?
-What?

685
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:14,959
Well…

686
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,003
I just want to review what we learned.

687
01:04:18,545 --> 01:04:19,838
It was water and…

688
01:04:21,006 --> 01:04:21,840
Sodium.

689
01:04:24,176 --> 01:04:27,972
But where can I buy stuff like that?
Is it expensive?

690
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:32,184
I'm not sure. But there's a lot
stored in the science room.

691
01:04:49,535 --> 01:04:52,913
Open the door. Open up, you jerk!

692
01:04:52,997 --> 01:04:56,292
Hey, open this before I break it.

693
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:58,711
Open the door!

694
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:03,340
You brat. I won't let it slide
if you keep ignoring me like this.

695
01:05:03,424 --> 01:05:07,219
Open up! Open the door!

696
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,346
Open the door, you brat.

697
01:05:10,556 --> 01:05:13,600
Hey! You're dead!

698
01:05:19,565 --> 01:05:23,360
Seo Won-ju.

699
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,613
Is Seo Won-ju absent?

700
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:28,949
-Han Tae-sul.
-Yes?

701
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:31,618
-You and Won-ju are close, right?
-No.

702
01:05:31,702 --> 01:05:33,829
You always went home together.

703
01:05:33,912 --> 01:05:35,664
He was just following me.

704
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,543
Mr. Yoon!

705
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,798
Study quietly in your seats.

706
01:05:48,552 --> 01:05:50,929
Guys, gather round.

707
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:52,598
Did you hear?

708
01:05:52,681 --> 01:05:55,809
My mom said Rabies' house was on fire.

709
01:05:55,893 --> 01:05:59,021
Didn't you hear
some kind of explosion yesterday?

710
01:05:59,104 --> 01:06:00,522
-Really?
-Yes!

711
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:02,900
His grandma and dad died.

712
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:04,401
All the dogs burned to death.

713
01:06:04,485 --> 01:06:06,153
-Really?
-Yes.

714
01:06:06,236 --> 01:06:09,073
I can see the future.

715
01:06:09,156 --> 01:06:12,618
The things I draw
always happen in real life.

716
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:14,036
Boom!

717
01:06:56,203 --> 01:06:59,706
It's quiet now.

718
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:06,004
I'm so happy that it's quiet.

719
01:07:08,465 --> 01:07:11,051
What have you done?

720
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:14,263
You taught me.

721
01:07:14,805 --> 01:07:16,890
I did the same thing you did.

722
01:07:18,058 --> 01:07:20,227
Go away. Stay away from me.

723
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,066
Turn yourself in to the police.

724
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,401
Why?

725
01:07:28,485 --> 01:07:32,239
I did the same thing you did.
How come you can do it and I can't?

726
01:07:32,322 --> 01:07:33,866
You told me to do it!

727
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,326
When did I do that, you lunatic? Get lost!

728
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:54,636
What did you say?

729
01:07:55,429 --> 01:07:58,724
Stay away from me. Get lost!

730
01:08:05,522 --> 01:08:06,815
Those eyes…

731
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:11,778
You're no different from the other kids.

732
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:24,666
I'm going to kill everyone.

733
01:09:11,463 --> 01:09:13,173
He said he'd be the first to ride it.

734
01:09:14,675 --> 01:09:16,051
Ride what?

735
01:09:18,011 --> 01:09:18,887
The uploader.

736
01:10:10,814 --> 01:10:11,940
It was a trap.

737
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:24,620
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

738
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,006
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

739
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:40,010
Han Tae-sul!

740
01:10:40,093 --> 01:10:41,511
That crazy jerk.

741
01:10:41,595 --> 01:10:44,556
Come play with me!

742
01:10:45,057 --> 01:10:48,727
Han Tae-sul!

743
01:11:18,382 --> 01:11:23,178
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

744
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:30,686
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

745
01:11:37,155 --> 01:11:40,408
Han Tae-sul!

746
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:19,377
<i>Seo-hae.</i>

747
01:12:19,429 --> 01:12:22,682
<i>I always wanted to do this
at a moment like this.</i>

748
01:12:23,993 --> 01:12:26,054
<i>They're making a fuss about us!</i>

749
01:12:26,266 --> 01:12:28,406
<i>Tae-sul did this all by himself.</i>

750
01:12:28,547 --> 01:12:31,884
Don't fight. You can't beat Sigma.

751
01:12:32,476 --> 01:12:35,646
<i>It's a gathering of people
who have control over Korea.</i>

752
01:12:35,714 --> 01:12:38,467
<i>They're all from the future.
The advance team.</i>

753
01:12:43,116 --> 01:12:47,245
-Seo-hae, no.
-You're all playing into Sigma's hands.

754
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,664
Let's just go. There's another chance.

755
01:12:50,248 --> 01:12:52,083
<i>There isn't another chance.</i>

756
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:56,880
