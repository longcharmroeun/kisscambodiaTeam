1
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,853
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,180
Is this the wrong way?

3
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,193
That hurt…

4
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,350
I came the right way.

5
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,756
This is so exhausting.

6
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm hungry…

7
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,943
Achasan…

8
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,114
ACHASAN ECOLOGICAL PARK

9
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,615
Achasan…

10
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,375
Which way is it?

11
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,420
Found it!

12
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,723
It's too far to take a detour.

13
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,906
Seo-hae!

14
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,451
Mom?

15
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,078
Gang Seo-hae!

16
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,290
-Seo-hae!
-Mom?

17
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,708
Seo-hae!

18
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,093
Gang Seo-hae!

19
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,776
Hold my hand!

20
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,247
It's okay now.

21
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,085
It's okay.

22
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,878
-Dad…
-It's all right.

23
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,338
It's okay now.

24
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,340
You're safe.

25
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,764
It's all right.

26
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,968
You should steer clear of sand.

27
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,513
Always follow the paths. I told you that.

28
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,432
Right.

29
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,018
And I told you to rest
if you're exhausted,

30
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,936
to make sure you can see ahead,

31
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,689
and to take the safe route
even if it takes longer.

32
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,193
-Right.
-But you didn't do as I told you.

33
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,245
You can't get to the uploader by yourself.

34
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,793
Seo-hae.

35
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,006
I want you to have a comfortable life.

36
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,385
Let's smuggle ourselves
out of the country.

37
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,054
No.

38
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,682
I made a promise to your mother. Please.

39
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,483
You brat…

40
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,530
Take this.

41
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,292
If you want to get to the uploader,
you'll have to shoot me first.

42
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,586
Dad!

43
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,965
-What?
-This isn't like you.

44
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,842
What are you so scared of?

45
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,637
I'm scared
that you might suffer, get hurt,

46
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,893
and die.

47
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,648
I'm not scared.

48
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,694
I'm only scared of giving up
before trying anything.

49
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,449
I can do it. I'm going to do it.

50
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,285
It's something only I can do.

51
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,875
I can't get to the uploader by myself.

52
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,544
I need your help, Dad.

53
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,633
Please.

54
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,846
I want to go to the past.

55
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,521
I MISS YOU, MOM

56
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,939
GOODBYE, MY FRIEND

57
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:21,735
SLEEP WELL, MY DAUGHTER

58
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,660
GOODBYE, BROTHER

59
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,703
Seo-hae, promise me

60
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,290
that you'll take care of yourself first
over there.

61
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,876
Dad.

62
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,838
And come find me
if something happens, okay?

63
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,716
Okay.

64
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,265
You'll need a lot of valuables
to get on the uploader.

65
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,100
And you have to pay the brokers.

66
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,564
They say people sell them for money
to settle down in the past.

67
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,235
Things like weapons or medicine
that doesn't exist in the past.

68
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,529
Dad, that's…

69
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,990
This will be enough for one person.

70
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,576
What about you?

71
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,460
How long have they been following us?

72
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,045
For two days.

73
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:55,973
State your names.

74
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,565
Your names!

75
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,944
Seo-hae. Gang Seo-hae.

76
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,738
Why do you want to take the uploader?

77
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,074
Answer me!

78
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,785
To stop the war.

79
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,412
How?

80
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,581
I just need to save one person.

81
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,624
Who?

82
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,962
Who?

83
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,596
Han Tae-sul.

84
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,516
Han Tae-sul?

85
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,480
-Tae-san.
-Han Tae-sul!

86
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,939
Han Tae-sul! Get down!

87
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,777
I said, get down!

88
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,874
So it was you.

89
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,030
Dad.

90
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,943
Dad.

91
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,293
This.

92
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,590
I got this scar when I fell from a bike.

93
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,341
When I was eight.

94
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,305
It's not that I doubt you.

95
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit confused.

96
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,455
You look the same as you did
when you were a kid.

97
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,582
You look like your mother.

98
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,752
You always said that.

99
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,087
And you're quite tall.

100
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,301
Your mother used to give you
herbal medicine to make you grow taller.

101
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,221
She'd be so happy to see you.

102
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,438
Here. This is how to get to the bunker.

103
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,483
I don't know who made it and why,

104
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,569
but a war breaks out on October 31.

105
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,989
So you and I lived there for 15 years.

106
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,954
BUNKER UNDER THE BRIDGE

107
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,665
What about your mother?

108
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,542
She…

109
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,099
If we knew about the war,

110
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,227
why didn't we leave the country
beforehand?

111
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,771
We can't.

112
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,650
People don't know it yet,
but the airports don't let us leave.

113
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,071
If the Control Bureau puts you
on the watch list, you can't leave.

114
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:28,245
You kept the promise you made to Mom.

115
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,999
You promised to keep me safe.

116
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,627
I did get injured here and there,

117
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,755
but it's only because
I kept going to dangerous places.

118
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,592
But I survived and grew up healthy.

119
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,850
I know what you're going to say.

120
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,437
You want to ask me
why I came to the past, right?

121
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,315
Because you wouldn't have let me go.

122
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,567
You're right.

123
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,028
But you did.

124
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,530
Thank you.

125
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,408
I tried fruit as you told me to.

126
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,535
Real fruit, not canned ones.

127
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,663
I even went to an amusement park,
and I met Mom.

128
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,084
And I met so many good people.

129
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,462
They don't try to steal what I have.

130
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,841
They get upset when I get hurt,
and risk their lives to save me.

131
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,596
I can do well on my own now.

132
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,890
And I'm not alone anymore.

133
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,144
I'll make sure
those people don't get hurt.

134
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,438
I'll make sure they can complain

135
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,858
about everyday life
without knowing anything about a war.

136
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,904
I'll change everything.

137
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,739
I can do it.

138
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,346
<i>So when you're lonely,</i>

139
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,182
stressed, or exhausted,

140
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,727
just look around you, and I'll be there.

141
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,940
I love you.

142
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,531
Hey! Mr. Han!

143
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,369
How does it feel to come back to life?

144
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,163
It feels great.

145
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,251
My entire life flashed before my eyes.

146
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,256
I felt that I should live kindly.

147
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,343
You should try it
when you have the chance.

148
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,680
No, thanks. I've committed too many sins.

149
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,099
My brother…

150
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,229
What have you done to him?

151
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,065
You promised to tell me. Come on.

152
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,991
All right.

153
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,202
Your brother Tae-san

154
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,332
was caught and tortured by Sigma.

155
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:23,253
Sigma took his key
and found out where his safe was.

156
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,338
And Agnes,
who worked for the Control Bureau,

157
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:30,302
took the opportunity to smuggle
your brother out,

158
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,887
along with the key.

159
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,808
So you're saying you were
all in on it together?

160
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,060
Sigma, Seo-jin, and the Control Bureau?

161
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,730
Don't say it like that.
We just have a complex…

162
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,399
Well, I guess I could say
it's a business relationship.

163
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,778
Anyway, after that,

164
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,281
I stole your brother from Agnes.

165
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,742
Then I offered him a deal.

166
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:59,497
I promised him that I'd protect you,
Han Tae-sul,

167
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,666
if he got me that key.

168
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,253
So you told him to come back
through the uploader once he got the key?

169
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,631
That's right.

170
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:13,845
Oh, don't you remember
our first phone call?

171
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,475
In Gimpo.

172
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,899
<i>Mr. Han Tae-san.</i>

173
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,364
Did you bring the key?

174
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,908
<i>Yes, I have the key.</i>

175
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,995
Are your limbs all there?

176
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,915
<i>-What?</i>
-Are your limbs all intact?

177
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,753
-Yes.
-Good. Your health is most important.

178
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,590
All right. Let's meet. Bring the key.

179
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,426
<i>Where should I go?</i>

180
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,303
We'll come pick you up.

181
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,181
Where are you now?

182
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,351
I'm at an acquaintance's house.

183
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,479
An acquaintance?

184
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,526
You said your limbs are all intact, right?

185
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,735
<i>Yes.</i>

186
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,154
But let me ask you something.

187
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,783
What's the number written
on your right arm?

188
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,582
Hey.

189
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,003
You're not Han Tae-san, are you?

190
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,551
Hey. Go get him.

191
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,052
Hurry up.

192
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,141
But Han Tae-san got caught by Sigma again.

193
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,394
Then Agnes was afraid that

194
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,606
Sigma might get his hands on
the uploader blueprint Tae-san had.

195
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,402
So she ended up injecting your brother
with the drug.

196
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,030
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I was told not to.

197
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:02,203
Anyway, the deal was that
Han Tae-san would get me the key,

198
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,789
and in return,

199
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,418
I'd provide
support and protection for you.

200
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,170
That's it.

201
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,050
Hey, you're here.

202
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,845
But did your father leave?

203
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,058
Her father seemed to have quite a temper,
didn't he?

204
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,976
I guess personalities are hereditary.

205
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,271
Let's go. I feel nervous staying here.

206
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,941
But I still have something left
to do here.

207
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,112
What are you two whispering about?

208
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,328
I helped save your girlfriend,
so you fix this now.

209
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,499
Hey. Do you have a flash drive?

210
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,958
A flash drive…

211
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,087
-A USB flash drive.
-Right. Yes, I do.

212
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,963
What's he telling you to fix?

213
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,008
I broke his downloader.

214
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,443
But you know,

215
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,780
I can't really trust you.

216
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:24,577
How can I trust you to let us go
in one piece after I give you this?

217
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,207
All right. Then I'll just kill you all

218
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,834
and take it.

219
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:35,046
Bingbing! Come over here.

220
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,718
Sis! Are you all right?

221
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,512
What about you?

222
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,640
I'm not all right.

223
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,476
Stand up straight.

224
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,729
Stop hitting me, will you?

225
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,313
Be quiet, you jerks.

226
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:55,859
Come on.

227
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,697
I locked it with a passcode.

228
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,369
You're trying to play tricks, are you?

229
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,372
Is that so? Shoot his hand.

230
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,333
-Just give it to him.
-What?

231
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,128
Just give it to him. It's okay.

232
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,422
Well, I'm not okay with it.

233
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,174
I'll take care of this.

234
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,720
Come on. Give it to me.

235
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,644
Right. The passcode.

236
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,316
-One.
-And?

237
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,319
Eight, one, eight.

238
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:44,199
Wow. What a simple passcode.

239
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,244
Bingbing!

240
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,209
Put this in and fix it.

241
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,840
Is it working or not?

242
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,551
I'm working on it!
I just rebooted the system.

243
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,969
I didn't even put it in yet.

244
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,763
Hurry up.

245
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,649
It's working.

246
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,361
Then can we go home now?

247
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,155
It was nice meeting you.

248
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,539
Darn it! I knew you'd do this.

249
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,040
What are you doing?

250
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,589
You owe me a debt.

251
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,884
I was taken to the Control Bureau.

252
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:49,264
That kid was shot,
and he got crippled for life.

253
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,685
Whose fault do you think that is?

254
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,606
Why are you blaming me?
You're in charge of your own life.

255
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,316
Stop this.

256
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,152
You said it's all predestined.

257
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,946
Getting taken to the Control Bureau

258
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,448
and not seeing your family
must be your destiny.

259
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,285
So why are you taking it out on me?

260
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,621
Taking it out on you? That's cute.

261
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,957
Right.

262
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,921
I'm angry
because I can't do anything about it.

263
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,843
I'm furious because it's all fixed!

264
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,847
Do you feel better if you say that?

265
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:36,728
Do you say that it's impossible to
change things in case you fail to do it?

266
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,229
You're just making an excuse.

267
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,487
But too bad. Let me tell you something.

268
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,198
Some things have already changed.

269
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,452
Seon-jae!

270
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,958
<i>I was supposed to get shot.</i>

271
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:03,338
It was written in my diary
that I'd be crippled after getting shot.

272
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,093
Give this to your brother.

273
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,556
-They're stem cells.
-What's that?

274
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,309
They can fix his legs.
They're not fully developed yet now.

275
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,021
You might be too cowardly to do it,
but I can change the future.

276
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,648
And it's already changing.

277
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,692
So shoot me if you want to.

278
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,781
Let's go.

279
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:53,096
I'm furious because I can't change things
that are predestined!

280
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,227
Seo-hae! You were so cool!

281
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,981
-But how are you feeling? Are you okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

282
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,691
Gang Seo-hae.

283
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,614
What you said back there, is it true?
Was that bullet meant for you?

284
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,867
-Yes.
-Why didn't you tell me?

285
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,620
Then you knew about
getting taken to the Control Bureau?

286
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,831
What else have you been hiding from me?

287
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,833
I don't know everything.

288
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,585
-What do you know then?
-Why are you so upset?

289
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,046
What's with you all of a sudden?

290
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:28,923
You're hurting me.

291
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,581
Seon-jae.

292
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,639
Are you feeling okay?

293
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,996
I sometimes have a certain dream.

294
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,458
I saw a grave.

295
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,543
It was my grave.

296
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,797
That's where I found my diary.

297
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,844
Then I touched something.

298
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,807
I've been having that dream since then.

299
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,850
What dream is it?

300
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,604
It's about what's going to happen.

301
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,819
Yes.

302
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,156
On the last day,
I was in some kind of a church.

303
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,702
We were wearing wedding outfits,

304
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,788
and I got shot.

305
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,459
Sigma told you to choose.

306
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,007
<i>-Mr. Han Tae-sul?</i>
-Are you Sigma?

307
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,138
Is it the girl or the world? Pick one.

308
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,225
Choosing between you and

309
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,810
the world.

310
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,729
How did you know?

311
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,023
I met Sigma

312
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,192
while you were asleep.

313
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,236
What did he say?

314
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,363
He told me to make the uploader.

315
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,537
That's why I told you not to find Sigma.

316
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,208
You have to choose between the two.

317
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,962
-And last time…
-I made the uploader, right?

318
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,008
If you face that situation again,

319
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,719
don't make the uploader.

320
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,929
Even if you do,

321
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,516
I'll die anyway.

322
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,642
No.

323
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,604
I have another chance now.

324
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,355
We'll just all die again.

325
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,026
What happens to you
if I don't make the uploader?

326
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,030
Without the uploader,

327
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,158
nobody would be able
to come from the future.

328
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,494
-Then you--
-Promise me

329
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,581
you won't make it.

330
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,824
See all this money?

331
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,244
I ordered water.

332
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,121
If it arrives, put it in the basement.
I wrote down a list.

333
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:34,377
Medicine and guns.
Just buy all the guns you find.

334
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,339
Gas masks, hazmat suits, salt, sugar,
canned food, and chocolate. Got that?

335
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,132
What about <i>ramyeon</i>?

336
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,135
No, the smell is too strong.
It'll attract everyone.

337
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,431
Oh, and get lots of jerky.

338
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,642
-We already have enough.
-We do?

339
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,311
Anyway, we can't leave
for several months this time.

340
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,146
So buy everything you can.

341
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,483
And if there's any money left,
bring it back.

342
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,777
-Where are you going?
-Somewhere.

343
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,070
-Where?
-Somewhere!

344
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,363
Don't forget anything.

345
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,876
Hey. I heard Mr. Park survived
because he was in jail.

346
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,253
I heard it myself yesterday.

347
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,755
-I already knew that.
-Me too.

348
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,632
I know you didn't know.

349
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,301
I did.

350
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,762
-Why was he in jail, then?
-He killed someone.

351
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,181
Really? He's a total scumbag then.

352
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,225
You didn't know that?

353
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,688
-Who did he kill?
-I don't know.

354
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,190
Darn it.

355
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,401
He's pretty secretive
about his personal life.

356
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,509
Goodness.

357
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,929
Nothing has changed.

358
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,394
I'm going to jump!

359
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,649
Have you lost your mind?

360
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,656
Who's the jerk that sends you
three million won every month?

361
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,033
I told you, I don't know!

362
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,537
Are you having an affair with him?

363
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,705
What?

364
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,167
-Are you crazy?
-Am I crazy?

365
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,881
You total scumbag.

366
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:49,095
You should be working hard instead of
beating up your wife like a loser.

367
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,639
You need to learn a lesson.

368
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,937
I'll teach you a lesson, you jerk.

369
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,237
What crazy asshole threw a rock at me?

370
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,531
If I catch you, you're dead!

371
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,409
Darn it. This is all your fault!

372
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:18,999
What are you doing?

373
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,710
Just getting some fresh air.

374
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,965
I heard you did a good job
at the Control Bureau. Thanks.

375
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:29,635
No, it's nothing. I didn't do much.

376
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,012
I just ran around
and stayed there as a hostage.

377
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,474
But I was really scared
that you wouldn't come back.

378
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,647
About that last day, is it true?

379
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,941
Did you eavesdrop?

380
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,777
No, I just overheard from the other room.

381
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,115
Honestly, I don't get anything
about the uploader, downloader, or war.

382
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,956
What if you leave the country with me?

383
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,543
Then nothing will happen to you, right?

384
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,045
I told you. I can't leave.

385
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,922
Why? Because of Han Tae-sul?

386
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,134
Did something happen between you two?

387
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,262
Darn it. I knew it.

388
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,639
Jae-sun.

389
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,062
Over there.

390
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,900
What? The Hangang Bridge?

391
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,527
My house was there. A bunker below it.

392
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,155
So you had a river view.

393
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,616
The river was all dried up.

394
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,117
No way.

395
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,580
Everything you see over there
is going to burn and crumble down.

396
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,999
I'm not staying because of someone.

397
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,210
I'm staying because I want to.

398
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,128
Then let me ask you something.

399
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,173
Why does the war break out?

400
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,468
Sigma explodes a nuclear bomb.

401
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,386
But he came here through the uploader.

402
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,057
-Right.
-Then get rid of the uploader.

403
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,393
-If you get rid of the person who made--
-Hey.

404
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,608
You're not acting like yourself.

405
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,193
You never hesitate to do things.

406
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,821
Sis.

407
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,325
You like Han Tae-sul, right?

408
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,297
-Why?
-I feel uncomfortable.

409
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,883
You can't do this so suddenly.

410
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,098
Oh, I only brought two cups.

411
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,226
Do you want one?

412
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,942
What's with him?

413
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,623
There's something I didn't tell you.

414
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,335
I told you I met Sigma, right?

415
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,507
And it felt like he knew me.

416
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,886
-What do you mean?
-He asked me

417
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,972
if I remembered him.

418
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,474
So I tried to recall him,

419
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,520
but I can't remember him at all.

420
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,773
He could have just been bluffing.

421
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,567
I'm not sure.

422
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,236
What's "bluffing"?

423
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,824
Hey.

424
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,535
Bluffing is like acting tough.

425
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,748
Pretending to have something
when you don't have anything.

426
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,085
That's what you always do.
You pretend to know everything.

427
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,297
Hey, that's different.
I really do know everything.

428
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,673
You're so ridiculous.

429
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,765
Do I really…

430
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,561
have to choose between you and the world?

431
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,272
I hate stuff like that.

432
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:15,069
I hate making choices. I always order
everything on the menu at a restaurant.

433
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,737
Stop joking around.

434
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,322
Fine.

435
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:25,871
It's just that
I don't exactly know how I feel.

436
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,417
I know that I should kill Sigma
and stop the war,

437
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,588
but you'll disappear if I do.

438
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,011
I'd hate that.

439
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,446
What could it be?

440
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,033
Did he know that we were going
to go to that house?

441
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,287
Did he

442
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,498
leave us this drawing on purpose?

443
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,918
But the drawing's a bit strange.

444
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,712
Strange? How?

445
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,594
This part.

446
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,763
The buildings don't exist in the future.

447
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,024
What's this?

448
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,192
Sorry?

449
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,027
This.

450
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,750
Hang on. I've seen this before.

451
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,555
I didn't know
why Tae-san was carrying these around.

452
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,765
I saw the drawing when I was little,

453
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,977
and Sigma seemed to know me.

454
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,690
So he and I must have met before.

455
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,066
WOOHYUNG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

456
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,236
So he's in one of those?

457
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:45,904
Yes.

458
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,658
We'll have to check all the photos, then.

459
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,495
-But are you okay with this?
-What do you mean?

460
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,247
You may want to hide your ugly past.

461
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,584
Hey, you even know
how to make jokes like that?

462
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,960
Who taught you?

463
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,338
I guess it was Jae-sun.

464
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,633
-Shut up.
-I don't have an ugly past.

465
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,094
I was born perfect.

466
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,306
All right. Fine.

469
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,338
What?

470
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,050
What is it? Did you find him?

471
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,635
No…

472
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,392
This girl. She used to have a crush on me.

473
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,564
I remember her. Song Ji-hye.

474
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:06,318
She made me 100 origami frogs, you know.

475
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,989
She's pretty. I guess you can ask her
to protect you now.

476
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,826
Come on, don't say stuff like that.

477
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,827
What?

478
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,538
That's enough, Seo-hae.

479
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:26,004
Wait a second.
You know, I've been thinking

480
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,172
scientifically.

481
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:32,094
I've been thinking scientifically
about that day.

482
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,306
The things that happened

483
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,976
while we were wandering
through time and space

484
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,813
weren't fixed events.

485
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,357
But I concluded that it was real.

486
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,485
What do you mean?

487
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,987
What we did at the beach…

488
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,450
<i>We…</i>

489
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,248
Hey. We only did that
because we thought it was the end.

490
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,500
What?

491
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,087
We were just saying goodbye.

492
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,673
Hang on.

493
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,927
Is that how you say goodbye in the future?

494
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,140
Are you all that passionate?
Do you have a different culture?

495
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,977
Or are you treating me like this
because I'm someone from the past?

496
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,106
-You said you're a misogamist.
-What does that have to do with this?

497
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,442
Do you even know what "misogamist" means?

498
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,778
Hey.

There's no name.

507
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:48,522
-Don't you have another one?
-Who'd keep two of these stuff?

508
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,525
Right.

DREAM JOB: A WRITER

516
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:41,741
You like pink, don't you?

517
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,412
-Why do you ask?
-I mean…

518
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,665
Your diary was pink, your gun was pink,

519
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,626
and all the little accessories were pink.

520
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,590
There are only about 72 hours left
until the war breaks out.

521
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,634
But that's all I know

522
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,971
about you.

523
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:09,102
I've wasted my whole life

00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,857
There's no time left.

526
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,947
My favorite food is bulgogi.

527
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,034
I already noticed that at the sauna.

528
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,994
And yours is <i>tonkatsu</i>.

00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,622

asking such questions?

00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,344
Checking your old student record?

541
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,555
Please write your name
and year of graduation here.

542
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,934
Well, I didn't graduate here.

543
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,769
Then write the year you entered.

544
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:39,401
HAN TAE-SUL

545
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,196
-"Han Tae-sul"?
-Yes.

546
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,698
The Han Tae-sul?

547
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,785
Oh, my goodness! I'm such a big fan!

548
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,621
You look much more handsome in person.

549
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,415
-Thank you.
-I'm…

550
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,042
I mean,
the students in my class are huge fans.

551
00:54:56,126 --> 00:55:00,880
At our science drawing contest,
everyone drew you fixing the plane.

552
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,217
Their dream jobs are all scientists now.

553
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,510
Is that so?

554
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,679
I thought only your brain was sexy,

555
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,682
but so is your mind and body as well.

556
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:14,561
Wow, that's a unique expression.

557
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,312
My goodness.

558
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,189
Hey, we don't have time.

559
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,403
-One of the students from 1991…
-Are you his girlfriend?

560
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,280
-No.
-Yes.

561
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,121
Could I take a photo with you?

562
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,498
-Of course.
-Thank you.

563
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,879
-Please don't upload it online, though.
-Oh, right.

564
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,338
I won't.

565
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,675
I can't believe this.
All right. One, two, three.

566
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:50,221
My goodness. Thank you so much.
I'll go find it right away.

567
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,266
No, it's fine.
Can I just go find it myself?

568
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,227
-Why…
-Well,

569
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,730
I'm not so confident about my old photos.

570
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,690
All right. Feel free to do so.

571
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,984
Thank you. Where's the archive room?

572
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,153
The end of the hallway
on the second floor.

573
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,696
All right.

574
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,823
Thank you.

575
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,023
Be quiet.

576
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,986
If you do that one more time, you're dead.

577
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,354
We found the suspect.
We got the location of Han Tae-sul.

578
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,402
-What about the girl?
-She's with him.

579
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,028
It's 20 minutes away.

580
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,411
Is it here?

581
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,495
Yes.

582

-Which class were you in?
-Class Four.

584
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,179
Do it gently, will you?

585
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,555
Just hurry up and find it.

586
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,016
What's with you?

587
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,979
"I thought only your brain was sexy,

588
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:06,107
but so is your mind and body as well."

589
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,694
-Is that what this is about?
-You were totally enjoying it.

590
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:14,908
Hey, I had to win her favor
to get in here.

591

Han Tae-sul.

593
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,628
"He has good grades
but isn't focused in class.

594
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:30,131
He's selfish and lacks consideration
for his classmates."

595
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,593
-Is that really written there?
-You're still the same.

596
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,304
"Very bright yet lacks social abilities.

597
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,767
Needs more guidance
in participating in group activities."

598
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,269
Hang on.

00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,866
<i>Tae-sul!</i>

Tae-sul!

602
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,165
Han Tae-sul! It's me, Seo Won-ju!

603
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,794
Hey! Han Tae-sul!

604
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,635
Yes.

605
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,264
It's him.

606
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,105
<i>You dung fly!</i>

607
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,607
<i>-You disgusting dung fly!
-You dung fly!</i>

608
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,485
<i>-You dung fly!
-You dung fly!</i>

609
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,989
You dung fly.
I told you to stay away from me.

610
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,198
Gross!

611
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,201
Are you borrowing books from the library
to spread your germs?

612
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,246
<i>Lord of the Flies</i>?
You always read books like this.

613
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,497
That's so disgusting.

614
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,374
He got his spit all over that.

615
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,752
My mom told me that he spreads rabies.

616
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,588
Your dad sells dog meat, right?

617
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,382
-Gross!
-You dung fly!

618
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,176
Rabies can't be spread between people.

619
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,181
And <i>Lord of the Flies</i> isn't about insects.

620
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,435
It's on our recommended book list.
Haven't you read it?

621
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,980
Who's this jerk?

622
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,816
It was Han something.

623
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,569
-Han Tae-sul.
-You knew how to talk?

624
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:18,823
You were staring at the sky all the time,
so I thought you couldn't speak.

625
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,701
We'll let you go since you have
good grades. So get lost.

626
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,244
I can't do that.

627
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,789
I'm in charge of the library books
this week.

628
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,541
I have to get borrowed books back.

629
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,085
You stupid orphan.
Do you have a death wish?

630
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,338
What's this?

631
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:37,133
Sodium and water. Try mixing them.

632
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,308
Mix them.

633
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:04,535
Get lost
before I explode something bigger.

634
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,500
He really mixed it
just because I told him to?

635
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,794
We just learned that in science class.

636
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:15,129
We were told to be careful
since it could explode.

637
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,382
Thanks.

638
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,843
For what? I was just reviewing
what we learned today.

639
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:33,648
Return it by tomorrow.

640
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,275
Don't forget.

641
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,719
Your dad's here!

642
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,974
-You brat!
-He's sleeping.

643
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,476
Aren't you greeting your dad,
you little jerk?

644
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,564
-Hey! Come out here! You brat.
-What's with you?

645
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,567
-Jeez.
-Stop drinking, will you?

646
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,902
-Hey!
-Stop it!

647
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,364
Did you lock the door? Open up!

648
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,117
Can't you hear me? Open up, you brat!

649
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,869
You little brat!

650
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,121
-Don't do this.
-You useless jerk. Get up!

651
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,623
-You little… Come over here!
-Stop it!

652
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,959
You're dead!

653
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:01,736
What's that?

654
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,950
I bet you're going to become
someone great when you grow up.

655
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,286
How would you know that?

656
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:13,372
I can see the future.

657
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:17,126
The things I draw
always happen in real life.

658
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:21,506
You're going to save the world.

659
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,424
I saw it.

660
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,930
-What is it?
-You don't have to know.

661
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,848
You're always drawing pictures.

662
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,100
-It's not a drawing.
-Then what is it?

663
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,978
-It's a blueprint.
-A blueprint for what?

664
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,567
Oh, for traveling in time?

665
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,529
Yes. I can't do it now,
but when I grow up,

666
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,781
I'm going to make one for real.

667
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:50,117
Cool. Then can you go to the future, too?

668
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,829
No. Only to the past.

669
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:56,958
Why? Isn't it boring to go to the past?
You already know what happened.

670
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,709
I'm going to go to the past.

671
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:03,589
Tae-sul.

672
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:09,762
If you really succeed
in making a time machine,

673
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,349
can I ride it first?

674
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,190
-Jeez!
-Darn it!

675
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:25,111
-Darn it!
-If I see you again, you're dead.

676
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,656
-That jerk.
-He's so annoying!

677
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:31,450
-Darn it!
-Hey, let's go.

678
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,873
-Does anyone still bully you?
-No.

679
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,458
-That's nice.
-Yes.

680
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:45,339
By the way, where did you get that bruise?

681
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,507
What?

682
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:54,891
Hey…

683
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:58,811
Can you teach me that thing
from last time? The explosion.

684
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,564
-Why?
-What?

685
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,609
Well…

686
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,653
I just want to review what we learned.

687
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,488
It was water and…

688
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:11,490
Sodium.

689
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:17,622
But where can I buy stuff like that?
Is it expensive?

690
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:21,834
I'm not sure. But there's a lot
stored in the science room.

691
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:42,563
Open the door. Open up, you jerk!

692
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,942
Hey, open this before I break it.

693
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,361
Open the door!

694
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:52,990
You brat. I won't let it slide
if you keep ignoring me like this.

695
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,869
Open up! Open the door!

696
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,996
Open the door, you brat.

697
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,250
Hey! You're dead!

698
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:13,010
Seo Won-ju.

699
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,263
Is Seo Won-ju absent?

700
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,599
-Han Tae-sul.
-Yes?

701
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,268
-You and Won-ju are close, right?
-No.

702
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,479
You always went home together.

703
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,314
He was just following me.

704
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,193
Mr. Yoon!

705
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,448
Study quietly in your seats.

706
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,579
Guys, gather round.

707
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,248
Did you hear?

708
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:45,459
My mom said Rabies' house was on fire.

709
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:48,671
Didn't you hear
some kind of explosion yesterday?

710
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,172
-Really?
-Yes!

711
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,550
His grandma and dad died.

712
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:54,051
All the dogs burned to death.

713
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,803
-Really?
-Yes.

714
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:58,723
I can see the future.

715
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:02,268
The things I draw
always happen in real life.

716
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,686
Boom!

717
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:49,356
It's quiet now.

718
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:55,654
I'm so happy that it's quiet.

719
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,701
What have you done?

720
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:03,913
You taught me.

721
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,540
I did the same thing you did.

722
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,877
Go away. Stay away from me.

723
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,716
Turn yourself in to the police.

724
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,051
Why?

725
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:21,889
I did the same thing you did.
How come you can do it and I can't?

726
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,516
You told me to do it!

727
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,976
When did I do that, you lunatic? Get lost!

728
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,286
What did you say?

729
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:48,374
Stay away from me. Get lost!

730
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,465
Those eyes…

731
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,428
You're no different from the other kids.

732
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:14,316
I'm going to kill everyone.

733
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:02,823
He said he'd be the first to ride it.

734
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,701
Ride what?

735
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:08,537
The uploader.

736
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:01,590
It was a trap.

737
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:14,270
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

738
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:25,656
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

739
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,660
Han Tae-sul!

740
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,161
That crazy jerk.

741
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:34,206
Come play with me!

742
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,377
Han Tae-sul!

743
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:12,828
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

744
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:20,336
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

745
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,012
Han Tae-sul!

746
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,093
<i>Seo-hae.</i>

747
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:12,429
<i>I always wanted to do this
at a moment like this.</i>

748
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:15,682
<i>They're making a fuss about us!</i>

749
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:18,227
<i>Tae-sul did this all by himself.</i>

750
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,647
Don't fight. You can't beat Sigma.

751
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,401
<i>It's a gathering of people
who have control over Korea.</i>

752
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,237
<i>They're all from the future.
The advance team.</i>

753
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:36,745
-Seo-hae, no.
-You're all playing into Sigma's hands.

754
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,164
Let's just go. There's another chance.

755
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,583
<i>There isn't another chance.</i>

756
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:46,380
