CASE REPORT

3
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,907
Jung Hyeon-gi's mother was reported dead
two days after death.

4
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,533
Her relative reported it.

5
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,410
Who made the notification?

6
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,837
-What is it?
-He's a judicial police officer.

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,422
The Immigration Control Bureau.

8
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,801
-Why would they get involved?
-It is strange.

9
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,136
What's his position?

10
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,971
His name's Hwang Hyun-seung,

11
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,809
and he's in Team 7 of the Control Bureau.

12
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,727
Team 7, Control Bureau?

13
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,607
Thanks. I'll treat you later.

14
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,275
But something's odd.

15
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,820
What is?

16
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:55,782
There are only six teams
in the Control Bureau.

17
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,975
Who are you?

18
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,310
Are you Hwang Hyun-seung's daughter?

19
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,062
Yes. Why?

20
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,815
I'm from the police.

21
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,443
I want to ask you a few questions
about him.

22
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,336
-I don't have any drinks or anything.
-It's fine.

23
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,966
Your father worked for
the National Intelligence Service?

24
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,342
Yes.

25
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,761
I heard he retired five years ago.

26
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,723
Has he gotten any other job since then?

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,433
I don't know.

28
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,061
Did he ever say anything
about going back in the field?

29
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,564
We haven't talked
since my mother passed away.

30
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,691
I didn't invite him to my wedding

31
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,777
or to my child's first birthday party.

32
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,656
When did you lose touch with him?

33
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,867
We didn't lose touch.
I stopped contacting him.

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,411
It's been ten years.

35
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,124
He didn't take care of my mom
when she had cancer.

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,254
He even made her cook breakfast
when she was sick.

37
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,174
He was busy
catching some illegal immigrants

38
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,135
that he didn't come home often.

39
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,472
So I was alone when my mother passed away.

40
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,182
"Illegal immigrants"?

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,017
Yes.

42
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,729
Could you give me his number at least?

43
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,862
All right. Thank you for your time.

44
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,032
Did something happen to him?

45
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,618
No, I just need to talk to him.

46
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,539
Just a second.

47
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,384
Actually, I received this last month.

48
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,971
I don't know who did it,

49
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,807
but a pool villa was reserved
under my family's names.

50
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,351
There's no one else but my father

51
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,062
who would've done such a thing.

52
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:38,528
TO HWANG JI-YEONG

53
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,245
<i>This is Jaae Hospital.</i>

SEO-HAE

56
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,929
Hey, Seo-hae. Did you have fun yesterday?

57
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,932
I'm sorry. I was so busy.

58
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,101
Seo-hae, let me talk to your mom.

59
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,186
Okay. Hang on.

60
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,605
Hello?

61
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,943
Yes. We had fun.

62
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,780
No, we ate at home.

63
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,324
But…

64
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,368
something strange happened.

65
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,121
Was there some kind of a problem?

66
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,301
No, it's nothing.
I'll tell you when you get home.

67
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,222
All right. Sorry about that.

68
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,891
Okay.

69
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,564
I'll see you later.

70
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,400
What?

71
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,612
Oh, you want a cake? What kind?

72
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,075
A chocolate cake? Okay.

73
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:12,330
You know, guns are useless
in a small space like this.

74
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,957
You bastard!

75
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,298
Who are you?

76
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,679
Who are you?

77
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,841
Garlic got cheaper this year, right?

78
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,426
-Yes, garlic is cheap.
-Garlic's cheap this year.

79
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,013
If one thing gets expensive,
something else gets cheap.

80
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,849
What's with him?

81
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,229
Help! Over here!

82
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,814

106
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,649
I didn't kill anyone.

107

You're lying.

108
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,528
I met the future you here.
You were regretting things.

109
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,864
So stop this now.

110
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,867
-That's nonsense!
-Your mother

111
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,621
didn't blame you until the end.

112
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,850
We're all the same.

113
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,519
We're filled with regrets.

114

139
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,838

140
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,092
I'm going to kill them all!

141
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,427
I'm sorry, Seo-hae.

142
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,222
I should have come for you sooner.

143
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,725
Get off.

144
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,688
What?

145
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,404
Why did you come? It's dangerous.

146
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,036
You're the only one who can protect me.

147
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,289
So I came to save you.

148
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,378
Let's go. We should hurry.

149
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,839

150
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,598

153
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,065
We have to go.

154
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,489
It's been a while.

155
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,042
Follow me.

156
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,782
Let me explain.

157
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,118
No, I think
it's better for me not to know.

158
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,124
Get out and go left. You'll get to Area C.

159
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,336
If you pass the area,
you'll arrive at the back gate.

160
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,421
Nobody will notice you.

161
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,260
Should I thank you?

162
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,138
I heard you paid for the funeral.

163
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,684
You didn't have to do that.

164
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,939
Well, it was technically my fault
those things happened to your father.

165
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,941
Thank you

166
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,778
for not reporting my dad to the police.

167
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,323
He was able to keep his honor.

168
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,578
-Seo-hae.
-You should go.

169
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,970
I sent them toward the back gate.

170
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,058
Give me my mom's medicine.

171
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,625
Area C.

172
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,170
We're here.

173
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,678
Kim Seo-jin!

174
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,764
Darn it!

175
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,450
You said I die on October 31.

176
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,535
Right.

177
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,788
That's why I came here.

178
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,043
I guess we won't be able to go to Hawaii.

179
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,129
I heard it's amazing there.

180
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,257
I was looking forward
to going there with you.

181
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,136
You know,

182
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,099
I had so many things
to apologize to you for.

183
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,559
But I didn't get to say anything.

184
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,021
I had so many things
to thank you for, too.

185
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,400
There are so many things
I'm sorry and grateful for.

186
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,907
I wanted you to know that, Seo-hae.

187
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,892
Sir, isn't that the exit?

188
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,228
Jeez, Mr. Han!

189
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,565
There you are.

190
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,276
It's nice to see you.

191
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,946
Stop!

192
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,074
Or I'll shoot.

193
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,785
You punk.

194
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,414
Hey. I'll spare your life.

195
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,875
I promised to do so.

196
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:32,838
And I'm not going to die today, you jerk.

197
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
Hey, Han Tae-sul!

198
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,762
Gosh, I don't know
if I'm glad to see you or not.

199
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,140
I can't really make up my mind.

200
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:11,019
Well, I'm really glad to see you.

201
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,980
It's been a long time.

202
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,945
Hey. I've been through so much here

203
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,906
because you reported me.

204
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,784
Wait! Just a minute.

205
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,578
Come on. Think about it.

206
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,291
How are you going to get out of here?

207
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,501
We're in the middle of the city.

208
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,336
Are you going to take a cab or what?

209
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,964
Are you going to take the subway
back to Asia Mart?

210
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,841
You'll get caught right away.

211
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:45,137
Think carefully.
Someone's waiting with my car upstairs.

212
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,597
He leaves if I don't come back in an hour.

213
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,100
There are only about five minutes left.

214
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,645
Hey. Are you trying to play
another trick on me?

215
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,480
I'm telling the truth.

216
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,817
Look, 4 minutes and 42 seconds.

217
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,277
Let's leave together.

218
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,406
Come on.
We can all go to Asia Mart together.

219
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,074
My car's really nice!

220
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,702
All right. The thing is,

221
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,497
Seo-hae's not well. Help us out here!

222
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,544
Help us.

223
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,676
Please.

224
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,107
I swear I'm going to kill you
after we get out of here.

225
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,986
Let's go.

226
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,157
Seo-hae…

227
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,093
Where is it?

228
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,764
Hey, Sun. Where are you?

229
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,933
In front of the hospital.

230
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,606
The whole place is in chaos.
What about Seo-hae?

231
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,818
I got her.
Meet me at the back gate in one minute.

232
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,195
-<i>And keep the car running.</i>
-Where?

233
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,571
The back gate, you idiot!

234
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,449
-Where's the back gate?
-Get to the elevator.

235
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,076
-Where?
-Here. Come on.

236
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,583
She got the shot.

237
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,086
"The shot"? What shot?

238
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,754
She'll die pretty soon.

239
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,507
Is that the car? Hurry up! Get in!

240
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,925
Hey! Get out!

241
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,845
Why are there so many people?

242
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,514
-What…
-Hey, get in.

243
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,515
Move.

244
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,142
Hurry up! Get in!

245
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,852
Seon-jae!

246
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,812
What's going on?

247
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,864
Die.

248
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,978
Dad?

249
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,234
-Seo-hae!
-Dad.

250
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,584
Hurry up! Get in!

251
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,701
SEOUL GANGBUK POLICE STATION

252
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,454
EDDY KIM EXPANDING THE BUSINESS

253
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,498
It's an article about my morning schedule.

254
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,294
Right… But…

255
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,422
Then how did

256
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,926
your iris get scanned at Jaae Hospital?

257
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,595
How would I know that?

258
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,764
Check the security camera footage!

259
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,683
Well…

260
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,479
You don't have any footage?

261
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,526
You really don't know anything about this?

262
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,654
I told you, I really don't know!

263
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,202
-What time is it?
-Almost noon, sir.

264
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,621
This is driving me crazy.

265
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,998
What's my next schedule?

266
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,125
The completion ceremony
for the IDC in Paju.

267
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,211
And after having lunch with the governor,
you come back to Seoul…

268
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:33,925
Seo-jin.

269
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,930
Seo-jin! Are you here about
what happened at the hospital?

270
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,474
You weren't picking up my calls.

271
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,435
Are you okay?

272
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,441
Sir.

273
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,863
They asked me if I entered the hospital.
Security records say I did.

274
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,074
I think it was Tae-sul.

275
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,245
Did you already know?

276
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,875
No. How would I know that?

277
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,211
What's going on with Tae-sul?

278
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,342
-I have to know today.
-Know what?

279
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,303
Who kidnapped Tae-sul
at the conference, and why?

280
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,138
What happened on the day of the party?

281
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,724
Why did we lie to Tae-sul?

282
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,312
Why did he run away?
And what happened yesterday?

283
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,482
You don't have to know that.

284
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,735
I believed everything you said,
and I did as you asked.

285
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:36,988
So tell me now.

286
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,324
The things that Tae-sul said…

287
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,704
All that nonsense…

288
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,790
<i>You probably don't believe me,
but it's true.</i>

289
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,709
We're not the only ones
living in this world.

290
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,212
Is it true?

291
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,304
-Why weren't you picking up?
-Boss.

292
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,557
Put him over here.

293
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,184
-You'll be okay, Seon-jae.
-What happened to him?

294
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,603
Hey! Call the doctor! Hurry!

295
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,981
And you, Bingbing, get the icebox.

296
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,151
Darn it.

297
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,867
-How many?
-Just bring them all!

298
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,329
Hurry up!

299
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,415
Hey. You're going to be okay.

300
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,256
What about the downloader?

301
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,966
The emergency generator's on.

302
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,510
Take good care of him, okay?

303
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,972
Darn it!

304
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,269
Right…

305
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,450
Darn it.

306
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,647
How is he?

307
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,943
I got the bullet out
and stitched the wound up.

308
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,071
But his pulse is too weak.
I don't think he'll make it.

309
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,948
If he does, he won't be able to walk.

310
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,701
You should stay with him tonight.

311
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,121
Hey!

312
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,166
Check her, too.

313
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,884
There's no cure for her.
Just hold her hand.

314
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,679
Hey, you quack!
You can't just leave like that!

315
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,349
Hey! Shut up.

316
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,601
Didn't you hear him? He can't help her.

317
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:22,231
Almost everyone who comes over dies.
There's no point liking her.

318
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,914
Get out.

319
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,084
How can I save Seo-hae?

320
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,295
She's going to die.

321
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,172
So what do I do?

322
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,341
Didn't I tell you

323
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,220
that I was going to kill you two
once we got out?

324
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,515
But I feel like killing you right now.

325
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,266
So get out. We can talk tomorrow.

326
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,395
Is that so?

327
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,231
All right, then.

328
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,860
What? Are you going to
call the cops again?

329
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,614
Fine. Do it.
But I won't let it slide this time.

330
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,116
Really?

331
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,329
The downloader must be important to you.
It's the first thing you checked.

332
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,916
Why?
Are you expecting something important?

333
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,584
Let me guess.

334
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,462
Something did feel odd
when I first came here.

335
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,007
I wondered why you were running Asia Mart.

336
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,259
You risked your life to come to the past,

337
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,804
but why aren't you thinking of living
a luxurious life like the others?

338
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:39,017
Why are you working as a broker
when you don't even earn much?

339
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,770
You're waiting for someone.

340
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,732
Maybe someone who didn't make it
when you did.

341
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,028
Hey. Shut up.

342
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,698
Fine. There's no need
for such a friendly conversation.

343
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:55,908
Here.

344
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,247
How's that?

345
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,302
What the hell?

346
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,434
What have you done?

347
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,519
I'm the one who coded this program.

348
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,189
Of course I made a backdoor just in case.

349
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,648
How can I save Seo-hae?

350
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,448
Get the downloader back on.

351
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,867
Or I'll blast a hole in your skull.

352
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,786
How do I save Seo-hae?

353
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:46,000
Fine, kill me. Just shoot me!

354
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,170
But if you do, you'll never be able
to run the downloader again.

355
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,590
Is that really what you want?

356
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,383
Come on.

357
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,969
Tell me!

358
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,154
All right.

359
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,408
She's disappearing.

360
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,036
What?

361
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:27,250
She's wandering around different timelines

362
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,043
like a ghost.

363
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,549
She will completely vanish in two days.

364
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,176
So?

365
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,636
It's obvious.

366
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,890
-You have to bring her back.
-How?

367
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,060
Darn it.

368
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,150
There was this advance team
dispatched here long ago.

369
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:57,155
They were the first ones
to come here through the downloader.

370
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,532
And I was one of them.

371
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,704
Then Sigma was on that team too?

372
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,873
Yes. That jerk was one of us.

373
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:19,677
<i>We each had a mission when we came here.</i>

374
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,846
Back then,
the Control Bureau didn't exist.

375
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,140
Who's Sigma?

376
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,686
-Are you curious?
-Just tell me! Who is he?

377
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,105
I don't know.

378
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:35,109
Even if I do,
there's no reason to tell you.

379
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,485
All right. Fine.

380
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,614
I'll just destroy the downloader.

381
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,033
Hey!

382
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,001
The injection she got…

383
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,006
Someone on the advance team
brought it here.

384
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,477
Agnes.

385
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,438
KIM AGNES

386
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,982
She's the one who made that drug.

387
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,612
Ask that woman how to save her.

388
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:26,577
And she might know who Sigma is, too.

389
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,166
Wait. I forgot something important.

390
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,922
Even if you get lucky enough

391
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,800
to bring her back,

392
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,512
she won't be the same girl
that you used to know.

393
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,555
What?

394
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,935
Something will be different about her
if you bring her back.

395
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,230
It's only natural.

396
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,650
If you want something,
you have to offer something in return.

397
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:02,113
Whether it's the eyes or the nose,

398
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,782
or memories.

399
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,787
And what if you get the cure
and just run away?

400
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,165
What about my downloader?

401
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,044
So I'm going with you.

402
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,547
Okay?

403
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,549
Let's go

404
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,136
before she disappears.

405
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,477
Sun!

406
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,066
-There's a cure.
-Really?

407
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,279
Yes. I'm going to go get it,
so take Seo-hae home.

408
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,197
Bingbing, the gun.

409
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,999
Take him to the server room
and tie him up.

410
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,627
Me? Why?

411
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,255
What are you doing?

412
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,092
Well, it's hard to trust you, Mr. Han.

413
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,636
So we need to hold a hostage.

414
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,390
He'll be kept here while we're away.

415
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,144
-He has nothing to do with this.
-That's why he's a hostage.

416
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,937
He wouldn't be if he was involved.

417
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,733
Hey, he won't even care if I die.

418
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,444
Is that so? That's even better.

419
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:30,034
If that server doesn't reopen
within 24 hours,

420
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,704
you, this girl, and this guy…
You're all dead.

421
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:43,464
Bingbing, if he tries anything funny,
just shoot him.

422
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,590
All right.

423
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,519
DO NOT ENTER

424
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,625
You were going crazy,
so I had to handcuff you.

425
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,049
I held the funeral for your mother.

426
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,138
You should've done it yourself.
You're her son.

427
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,644
I was worried about you,
but it seems like you're doing fine.

428
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:43,983
Hey.

429
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,320
You're in Team 7
of the Control Bureau, right?

430
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,952
Can you tell me what this is about?

431
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,205
ILLEGAL ENTRANT GANG SEO-HAE WANTED

432
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,500
Why is my name
and my daughter's name on this?

433
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,711
And what's this photo?

434
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,172
I don't get what this is.

435
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:13,304
Hyeon-gi. Are you forbidden
from talking to civilians like me now?

436
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,475
Answer me!

437
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,685
What's going on?

438
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,321
Why is Seo-hae's name on that poster?

439
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,575
Why is a nine-year-old's name
on a wanted poster?

440
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,670
Hyeon-gi.

441
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,591
Just tell me anything.

442
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:56,847
Tell me for old time's sake.

443
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,976
Jung Hyeon-gi!

444
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:33,717
ILLEGAL ENTRANT GANG SEO-HAE WANTED

445
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,406
-You're home.
-Where's Seo-hae?

446
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,992
She went to bed, of course. It's late.

447
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,910
Get changed. We have to go.

448
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,579
What? Why?

449
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,220
What's going on?

450
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,681
I'm not sure, but we can't stay here.
Let's go.

451
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,890
Honey!

452
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,438
What…

453
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:43,996
Who is it?

454
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,211
-What's this for?
-Go to Seo-hae's room.

455
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,048
If something happens,
point the gun and pull the trigger.

456
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,592
What's going on? Who is it?

457
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,303
Honey. I don't know, either.
Just go inside.

458
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,304
Honey!

459
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,146
Honey. Go inside.

460
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,106
Honey… All right.

461
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,938
Are you Mr. Gang Dong-gi?

462
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,316
Who are you?

463
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,781
Put that knife down.

464
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,534
I'll be faster, you know.

465
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,328
Both of you, stop it.

466
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,957
It'll only take 10 minutes.

467
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,918
Five.

468
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,673
I'm Han Tae-sul.

469
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,466
You know who I am, right?

470
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,470
I need to talk to you urgently.

471
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,432
Could I go inside for a minute?

472
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,643
Let's hear him out first.

473
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,147
I don't know what's going on, either.

474
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,316
-But we should at least hear him out.
-Honey, how…

475
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:50,247
So what you're saying is that

476
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,792
a time machine is made in the future,

477
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:58,297
and Seo-hae rode that
to come to the present?

478
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,174
Yes.

479
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,263
And you're saying that some people…

480
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,473
The Control Bureau.

481
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,934
You're saying that they're coming
to get us right now?

482
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,397
This is ridiculous.

483
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:20,694
Honey. Is this some prank?
Are you two in on this together?

484
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,071
-Eun-hui.
-Stop it.

485
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,532
This doesn't make sense!

486
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:29,828
Here.

487
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,458
Seo-hae was wearing this.

488
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,336
<i>Thank you.</i>

489
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,882
Oh! I have the exact same necklace.

490
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,675
What a coincidence.

491
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:55,646
It might be a bit awkward in this
situation, but let me show you something.

492
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,524
Could I see that for a minute?

493
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:17,042
The way that uploaders
and downloaders work, to put it simply,

494
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,003
is like copying files on a computer.

495
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,507
They copy data in the future
and send it here.

496
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,844
But the original data and its copy
can't exist at the same time

497
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,807
because the copied data is given
a temporary status.

498
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,559
So…

499
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,981
if the data overlaps like this…

500
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,246
It was hard for me to believe it too.

501
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,833
Some stranger suddenly came up to me

502
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:01,044
and talked about protecting me
and saving the world.

503
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,255
When I wasn't such a valuable person.

504
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,382
I said, get down!

505
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:10,721
<i>She was running around everywhere
trying to save the world,</i>

506
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,349
but I only stood and watched.

507
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:18,145
I didn't know what to do.
No, even when I knew,

508
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,689
I was busy running away like a coward.

509
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,912
Did something happen to her?

510
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,540
Your daughter…

511
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,755
Your daughter is not well.

512
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,175
I thought you should know,
so I came to tell you.

513
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,308
I want to see her myself.

514
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,735
Hey.

515
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,196
Why did you bring this guy?

516
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,115
Because he's Seo-hae's father, of course.

517
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:17,496
Why don't you bring all her neighbors
and friends while you're at it?

518
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,706
Who is he?

519
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,001
No need for you to know.

520
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,615
She said

521
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,703
she got it
when she fell from a bike as a kid.

522
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,079
That's right.

523
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,959
This is impossible.

524
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,755
Seo-hae talked about you often.

525
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,549
She said you were really strong,

526
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:56,428
that you taught her
how to survive after the war.

527
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,557
According to her,

528
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,144
there's going to be a nuclear war soon.

529
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,147
Everyone's going to die.

530
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,319
She said that's why she came here

531
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,488
to change the past.

532
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,787
What's happening to her?

533
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,706
She's disappearing.

534
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,125
What do you mean?

535
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,045
Like that necklace? Why?

536
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,216
The Control Bureau did this to her.

537
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,720
Then what do I do?

538
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,600
We have to bring her back.

539
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,229
Go on. Hurry up.

540
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,564
Will you be okay?

541
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,317
Of course not!

542
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,654
But there's no other way.

543
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,532
I can't be of any help right now.

544
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,200
So hurry up.

545
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:04,287
Bingbing, you know what to do
if I'm not here in 24 hours, right?

546
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,581
Just shoot everyone.

547
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,041
Okay.

548
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,292
Let's go.

549
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,089
Just hang in there.

550
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:15,966
I'll be back soon.

551
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:39,948
YEAR 2035

552
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:13,732
Dad.

553
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,621
Take two pills after your meals.

554
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,624
It says you could get a stomach ulcer.

555
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,251
What's a "stomach ulcer"?

556
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,547
It's when there's a hole in your stomach
so it hurts a lot.

557
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,051
Then eat some more.

558
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,720
I'm fine now.

559
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,201
Dad.

560
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,036
Yes?

561
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,874
Who's Han Tae-sul?

562
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,133
Can I stop the war if I save Han Tae-sul?

563
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,802
Who told you that?

564
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,890
I don't know anyone like that.

565
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,018
And how can you stop a war
that already happened?

566
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,980
I can take an uploader and go to the past.

567
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:39,567
Gang Seo-hae! You promised
you wouldn't talk about that again.

568
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,570
You know who Han Tae-sul is, don't you?

569
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,281
-No, I don't!
-Why didn't you tell me?

570
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,246
-Why didn't you--
-I made a promise

571
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,124
with your mother.

572
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,459
You're lying.

573
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,086
You can't do it.

574
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,671
-I can.
-No!

575
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,089
How do you know that?

576
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,719
I know because I saw it. I saw it myself!

577
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,221
I saw you dying!

578
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,142
I saw it with my own eyes.

579
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:24,529
Whatever you try to do there,
you're going to fail.

580
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,657
Everyone you meet is going to die.

581
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,243
And everyone is going to try to kill you!

582
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,537
You'll have to keep running away
from them!

583
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,959
Seo-hae.

584
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:43,840
The past is much more terrifying
than the present. All right?

585
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,844
So don't ever mention this again.

586
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,128
Dad?

587
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,298
Dad.

588
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,104
<i>Dad.</i>

589
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,649
<i>Take 20mm of medicine twice a day.</i>

590
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,859
<i>Don't forget to take them after meals.</i>

591
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,198
<i>We only have 12 canned foods left.</i>

592
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,201
<i>If you ration it well, you'll have enough
until you're healed.</i>

593
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,749
<i>I'm taking half of the guns and bullets.</i>

594
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,546
<i>You said I'm going to fail,</i>

595
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,422
<i>but I'm still going to try.</i>

596
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,425
<i>Because I haven't done anything yet.</i>

597
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,345
<i>You asked who told me</i>

598
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:15,306
<i>if I could save the world
by saving Han Tae-sul.</i>

599
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,184
<i>It was me.</i>

600
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,981
<i>It was written in the journal
that I wrote to myself.</i>

601
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:27,193
<i>I might have ignored it
if it was from someone else.</i>

602
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,697
<i>And you might be right.</i>

603
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,033
<i>But I want to believe what I said.</i>

604
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,414
<i>I miss Mom so much,</i>

605
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,292
<i>and I feel so bad for you.</i>

606
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,923
<i>I wrote that I could succeed this time.</i>

607
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,509
<i>I can change everything.</i>

608
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,973
<i>I'll be back, Dad.</i>

609
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,939
<i>I love you. Thank you for everything.</i>

610
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,088
My goodness.

611
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,258
All right.

612
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,563
Yes, they're all illegal entrants.

613
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,940
They're going to be adopted abroad.

614
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,317
How kind.

615
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,237
But isn't that illegal?

616
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,365
If you're that curious,
go in and ask her yourself.

617
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:41,077
Aren't you coming inside?
What if I run away?

618
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,622
Just run away, then.

619
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,666
I don't want to go in.

620
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,836
I'm not exactly on good terms with her.

621
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,506
Wow, I can't believe you're
actually afraid of someone.

622
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,216
Do you owe her money or something?

623
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,719
Hey. It's nothing like that.

624
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:02,724
I'll be looking around, so go ahead.
I'm not going in there.

625
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:05,685
My gosh. Don't fight, kids.

626

629
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,646
She's the one who made that drug.

630
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:35,024
Ask that woman how to save her.

What the hell?

636
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,439
Who do we have here?

637
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,695
Aren't you the CEO Han Tae-sul?

638
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,785
Yes, that's my name,

639
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,372
but I'm not the CEO anymore.

640
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,542
That's right.

641
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,795
But what are you doing here?

642
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,672
Well…

643
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:44,844
Some evil person made a scary drug,

644
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,014
and there's someone who's suffering
because of it.

645
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:51,184
I came to ask
if there's any way to cure her.

646
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,145
Ms. Kim Agnes.

647
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,231
How did you find me here?

648
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,068
Was it Park Hyeong-do?

649
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,571
Is he the one who told you?

650
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,283
Was his name Hyeong-do?

651
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,118
I see. Well, anyway…

652
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,872
I don't know what he told you,

653
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:17,210
but what you're looking for isn't here.

654
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:21,756
This is just a plain orphanage.

655
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:26,844
All right. Stop fooling around.
I don't have much time.

656
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,014
Kim Seo-jin.

657
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,991
Those papers over there.

658
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,119
You wrote them.

659
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,539
I read them once when I couldn't sleep.

660
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,297
You were one of them.

661
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,356
<i>So you were on the advance team?
What a surprise.</i>

662
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:23,818
Give me the cure.

663
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,153
There's no such thing.

664
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:27,738
You made the drug.

665
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:31,450
The one used to torture people at the
Control Bureau. You must have its cure.

666
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:37,373
All right. Let me tell you something.

667
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,084
The last time I met you was
at Jaae Hospital,

668
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:44,964
when I ran into you
while running away from there.

669
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,842
So I have a bit of a grudge
against you right now.

670
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:49,844
Actually, a huge grudge.

671
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,326
Who is it for?

672
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,578
Seo-hae.

673
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,372
Why would I save her?

674
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,879
Because you're the one
who made her like that.

675
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,091
And I don't want to lose her.

676
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,514
You shouldn't have come here today.

677
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,350
Why?

678
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,901
-It's cute.
-Hi.

679
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,487
Hello.

680
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:54,033
Where's the director?
She left in the middle of a conversation.

681
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,287
She went into her office.

682
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:01,832
It's not my fault.

683
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,377

<i>Mr. Han will never see you again</i>

696
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:38,345

699
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,351
