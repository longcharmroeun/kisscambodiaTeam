00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,978
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:07,150
Seo-hae, listen to me.

3
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,610
Please.

4
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,739
Not today. Please, Seo-hae.

5
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,410
Not today.

6
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,331
Please.

7
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,886
Tae-sul…

8
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,436
-What happened?
-The camera must've been turned off.

9
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,158
He ran away.

10
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,810
Taxi!

11
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,401
Darn it!

12
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,599
Darn it.

13
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,279
Hey.

14
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,660
What about Sigma?

15
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,580
He's gone.

16
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,040
Darn it.

17
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,500
SEO-HAE

18
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,253
-What about the girl?
-I don't know.

19
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,546
Please leave a message…

20
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,635
Is she not picking up?
Isn't there a GPS tracker on her phone?

21
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,429
No, because of the Control Bureau.

22
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,640
Darn it.

23
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,058
Jeez.

24
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,477
Let's go, Bingbing.

25
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,778
Hello? Seo-hae?

26
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,448
Thank you. I survived thanks to you.

27
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,659
You jerk…

28
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,621
Why are you taking it out on me?
You made the decision.

29
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,123
What about Seo-hae?

30
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,751
Is she mad at you?

31
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,004
I didn't do anything.

32
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,924
She left of her own accord.

33
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,262
I don't think she'll come back to you.

34
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,474
After all, you just protected the person

35
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,184
who killed her father.

36
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,813
That's terrible.

37
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:37,277
Anyway, I owe you one today.
I'll take good care of your brother.

38
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,363
I swear I'm going to find you and--

39
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,990
And now I'm warning you.

40
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,744
Of course,
you're a precious resource to me.

41
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,663
So I won't kill you.

42
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,792
But you'd better not dig up my past again.

43
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,547
If you do,
I'll find all the people that you two love

44
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,382
and send their bodies back to you.

45
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,345
I'm telling you again. Don't find me.

46
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,848
I'll find you.

47
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,311
That's what our relationship
should be like. Okay?

48
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,396
Shut up, you bastard!

49
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,389
That asshole…

50
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,810
Gosh, my ear hurts.

51
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,313
He always had quite the temper.

52
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,900
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes.

53
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,611
-You know the next step, right?
-Yes, sir.

54
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,367
All right,
you've all done a good job in politics.

55
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,038
Just enjoy everything from now on. Cheers!

56
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,165
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

57
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,941
You know,

58
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,278
many great people
used to be nothing special in their past.

59
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,116
They never imagined
that they'd end up doing something great.

60
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,077
You know Edison, right?

61
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,251
He'd always lost against Tesla,
but what happened in the end?

62
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,128
He eventually won.

63
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,630
Tesla met a miserable end.

64
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,757
I heard he died in a motel room.

65
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,385
Am I right?

66
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,101
People these days only think
of electric cars

67
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,686
when they hear the name Tesla.

68
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,312
But they all know Edison.

69
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,944
I believe that you can become
such a person, Eddy.

70
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,196
Someone like Edison.

71
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,574
Your names are similar, too.

72
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,162
Isn't a war going to break out

73
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,249
if we make the uploader?

74
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,877
Tae-sul said so.

75
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,754
A war?

76
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,383
No.

77
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,429
Did he say I'm going to start a war?

78
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,348
How?

79
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,603
How would I do that?

80
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,438
That's nonsense.

81
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,858
Everyone's blaming me for everything.

82
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,907
The war was going to happen anyway,

83
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,201
and the uploader saved people.

84
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,536
The uploader that you made.

85
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,539
You might not know it now,

86
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,084
but the uploader saved lots of people.

87
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,798
Dr. Kim's mother survived
thanks to the uploader, too.

88
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,136
You see,
there's a cure for ALS in the future.

89
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,230
The sooner you make it,

90
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,857
the more people will be saved.

91
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,615
I don't really beg people to do things.

92
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,661
Someone else is going to beg you.

93
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,587
You have to make it.

94
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,008
Please.

95
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,426
Seo-jin.

96
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,940
So it won't work
without Han Tae-sul's code?

97
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,151
I'll get that code.

98
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,196
You just focus on the machine.

99
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,751
Why don't you have some snacks?

100
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,503
Oh, thank you!

101
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,675
We won't have to run
experiments for a while.

102
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,428
-Why?
-Then what do we do?

103
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,305
Let's finish the machine first.

104
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,849
Let's increase the capacity.

105
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,727
Here's the blueprint.

106
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,230
-Then how will we operate…
-That can come later.

107
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,274
Just focus on the machine.

108
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,443
Why don't you eat your snacks first?

109
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,070
-Thank you!
-Thank you for the food.

110
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,951
We have to increase the capacity.

I didn't get shot, and I'm fine.
So don't worry about me.

118
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,668
Don't wander around by yourself.

All right. I'll take the photo.

125
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,717
Look over here. You look so pretty.
One, two, three.

126
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,562
Seo-hae,
why don't you smile a little more?

127
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,565
All right. One, two… Just a little more.

128
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:19,321
Seo-hae, can't you smile more?
What's this awkward look?

129
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,741
Come on. I look pretty happy,
considering the world ended.

130
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,118
Let's measure your height.

131
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,495
Dad, I'm not growing anymore.

132
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,747
-I'm all grown up now.
-No way.

133
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,377
You should be at least 170cm to look good
when you meet a man like me.

134
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,672
-You should grow two more centimeters.
-Give me that.

135
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,008
Look here, Dad.

136
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,635
All right.

137
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,598
Let's see.

138
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,938
You finally smiled properly.
It looks good.

139
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,899
Aren't I good at taking photos?

140
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,358
You are.

141
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,822
FEBRUARY 17, 2032

142
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,903
Sis, I'm leaving now.

143
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,072
I just wanted to say goodbye.

144
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,077
Thank you for everything. Thanks to you…

145
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,705
Are you crying?

146
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,669
Answer me. Where are you?

147
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,546
Hello?

148
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,924
Darn it.

149
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,273
-I see.
-I knew it.

150
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,450
Right. I thought so too.

151
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,411
Do you really have to do that?

152
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,455
-What?
-I'm just telling the truth.

153
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,474
Is it girl talk?

154
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,229
That's where our old house is,

155
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,233
and that's where your grandma's house is.

156
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,528
Where's the uploader?

157
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,616
It's…

158
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,912
Achasan Station…

159
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,123
Here it is.
We have nine stations left to go.

160
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,833
What's this?

161
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,879
Use it as a last resort.

162
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,299
Open it when you have no other option.

163
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,953
Is it the girl or the world?

164
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,539
You can only choose one.

165
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,045
I saw a grave.

166
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,839
It was my grave.

167
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,550
That's where I found my diary.

168
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,302
Then I touched something.

169
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,390
I've been having that dream since then.

170
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,225
What dream is it?

171
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,645
It's about what's going to happen.

172
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,777
I remember now.

Who is it?

179
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,884
I don't know.

180
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,260
You little…

181
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,640
That crazy bastard.

182
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,106
Mr. Park!

183
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,196
Why did you bring a gun? Who's it for?

184
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,448
What are you doing here?

185
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,117
-I was just passing by.
-Why pass by here?

186
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,912
Actually, Seon-ho told me to follow you.

187
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,083
Whatever. Just go.

188
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,919
Did you do everything I told you to do?

189
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,546
We're on it. I'll get to it later.

190
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,635
-Do you have anything to eat?
-No.

191
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,140
Are you waiting for someone?

192
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,935
-Who would I be waiting for?
-Who is it?

193
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,188
I'm not waiting for anyone.

194
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,192
Was that guy really Sigma?

195
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,861
Yes. He was really Sigma.

196
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,824
We could've stopped the war
if we just killed him. Right?

197
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:28,287
You idiot.
If he dies, we'll go out of business.

198
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,790
Maybe you're right.
Anyway, what's with the gun?

199
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,417
You little…

200
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,586
It's just for self-protection.

201
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,590
Plus, this is a democratic society.
I'm free to do whatever I want.

202
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,510
Stop being so nosy
and just mind your own business.

203
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,597
-Carrying a gun is illegal, though.
-I like illegal stuff.

204
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,227
So be quiet.

205
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,633
What was that?

206
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,804
That crazy jerk.

207
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,308
What's going on?

208
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,018
Hey, come out here.

209
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,065
Hey!

210
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,818
Come out!

211
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,324
You.

212
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,702
You're the guy who threw
a rock at me the other day, right?

213
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,497
It's you, plate 1148. Right?

214
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,168
Hey! Come on out here. You asshole.

215
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,796
Come on. Hey.

216
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,048
You jerk.

217
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:06,551
You're the guy who's been sending

218
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,472
my wife three million won
every month, aren't you?

219
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,892
What have you been doing with my wife?

220
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,979
Come on out, you jerk!

221
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,691
So you're refusing to come out,
you bastard?

222
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,193
Hey!

223
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,363
That crazy jerk is you!
Why did you come here?

224
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,158
You're the one who sent her
all that money, aren't you?

225
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,287
You asshole.

226
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,250
Just ram into him!

227
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,138
You asshole.

228
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,059
Oh, my gosh.

229
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,520
That jerk…

230
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,368
He's coming! What are you waiting for?

231
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,955
He's totally crazy.

232
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,472
All right, you jerk.

233
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,357
Mr. Park!

234
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,234
All right. Today's the day

235
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,069
you die.

236
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,156
Hyeong-do!

237
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,283
Stop it!

238
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,871
Stop this.

239
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,254
Have you lost your mind?

240
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,301
I'll kill you if you hit her.

241
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,556
I'm warning you. If you hit her
one more time, I'll really kill you.

242
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,391
Get lost.

243
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,561
-Let's go.
-What the heck is this?

244
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,147
-Let go of me!
-Let's go.

245
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:28,109
You jerk, 1148!
If I see you ever again, you're dead!

246
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,613
Let go of me! Stop coming here, you jerk.

247
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,157
That jerk… Let go!

248
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,959
Damn it.

249
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:01,309
SHELTER

250
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,147
I had nowhere else to go.

251
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,984
This is the only place I know.

252
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,632
Seo-hae, wake up.

253
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,137
Gang Seo-hae.

254
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,152
There's only one thing
you need to learn now.

255
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,571
How to survive.

256
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,366
No. I want to go home.

257
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,576
I promised your mom that I'll raise you

258
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,578
to be healthy and strong.

259
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,167
Hold it.

260
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,920
Stretch your arms out.

261
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,798
Keep your eyes open.

262
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,592
Keep your arms out straight.

263
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,969
That's it.

264
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,015
It's heavy.

265
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,476
The trigger will feel light.

266
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,563
Look ahead of you and shoot twice, okay?

267
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,815
Bang, bang.

268
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,858
Bang, bang.

269
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,235
Let's try it.

270
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,326
All right.
There's a monster in front of you.

271
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,900
Good job.

272
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,282
Breathe in and hold your breath.

273
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,783
Shoot.

274
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,494
Shoot.

275
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,123
Get ready again.

276
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,668
Hold your breath and aim.

277
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,711
Shoot.

278
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,645
Again!

279
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,240
Pick it up!

280
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:42,549
I won. I finally won!

281
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,842
I won!

282
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,159
DAD, MERRY CHRISTMAS
I LOVE YOU

283
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,830
Dad! Merry Christmas!

284
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,790
Hey! Come over here!

285
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,165
What are you doing here?

286
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,169
This is the only place you'd be.

287
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,173
How did you know this place?

288
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,426
Don't you get it?

289
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,766
I made this place.

290
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,896
A place for your family.

291
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,815
It doesn't matter how much it costs.

292
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,443
The air purification system
is the most important.

293
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,488
And we need a hydroponic system.

294
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,033
It should be earthquake-resistant
like nuclear power plants.

295
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,452
Make sure it can even endure
a nuclear bomb.

296
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:39,624
All right. You can see everything
on the blueprint, right?

297
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,509
Aren't you going to put that down?

298
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,429
You're not going to shoot me.

299
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,023
It's heavy.

300
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,192
Hold this instead.

301
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,409
Let's talk.

302
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,333
Go. I don't want to talk to you.

303
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,335
I'll leave in ten minutes.

304
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,629
I'm exhausted.

305
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,591
-Get out.
-Fine. Then I'll leave in three minutes.

306
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,848
Come over here.
I want to show you something.

307
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,986
You said medicines are the most important.
Antibiotics.

308
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,157
They're kept in cold storage.

309
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,868
Don't take these too often, though.

310
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:02,123
There's also an armory here, just in case.

311
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,423
And this room…

312
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,060
There are frozen bananas as well.

313
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,103
Even dried bananas.

314
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:29,067
Over there.
The shelves are full of frozen bananas.

315
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,945
And from there to there,
it's filled with tteokbokki.

316
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,032
And from there to there,
it's filled with bulgogi.

317
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,369
And these

318
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,581
have been grown with a hydroponic system.

319
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,834
You need fresh food, too.

320
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,128
And one more thing.

321
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,715
The door.

322
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,470
Even when it breaks down,
now you can close it…

323
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,104
from both the inside and the outside.

324
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,022
It'll close no matter what.

325
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,071
So your mother will be safe now.

326
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,283
What happened before won't happen again.

327
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,039
You really

328
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,292
made this bunker?

329
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,548
I thought hard
after you told me about the bunker.

330
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,967
But there wasn't anyone

331
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,428
around you or your father who would have

332
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,140
the brains and wealth

333
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:46,352
or the initiative and drive

334
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,020
to make such a thing.

335
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,523
Except for me.

336
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,902
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

337
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,867
I felt like I had to do it.

338
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,120
No, I wanted to do it for you.

339
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,624
Even if we fail this time

340
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,502
and a war breaks out again,

341
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,840
the nine-year-old Seo-hae

342
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,801
and her parents

343
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,637
will be safe.

344
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,481
Three minutes have passed.

345
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,737
I'll get going now.

346
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,518
Well…

347
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,273
Should we turn off the lights now?

348
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,734
No. I want to keep them on.

349
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,696
Oh, you want to keep them on.

350
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,744
Why is this bed so small?
I should've ordered a bigger one.

351
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,621
You're ridiculous.

352
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,711
This bed felt so big when I was little.

353
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,547
But it was actually small.

354
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,489
Move your body like this.

355
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,826
Push with your right hand
and pull with your left.

356
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,744
Like this?

357
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,954
Like this?

358
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,790
Put your feet at a 45-degree angle.
Keep your back straight.

359
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,459
Is this okay?

360
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,253
-Do it properly.
-I am doing it properly.

361
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,172
Am I doing it right?

362
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,468
There shouldn't be too much lubricant.

363
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,095
The gun might explode if the oil hardens.

364
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,767
And there shouldn't be anything
on the barrel. Or any cracks on it.

365
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,019
If you've checked everything…

366
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,577
It should feel smooth
when you pull it several times.

367
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,337
My target was over there,
and I practiced from over here.

368
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,426
How long did you stay in here
without going outside?

369
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,474
For nine years.
From when I was 9 until I turned 18.

370
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,228
At first, I didn't know that I wouldn't
be able to leave for a long time.

371
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,773
I couldn't tell if it was day or night,
summer or winter.

372
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,026
Every day was the same.

373
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:10,491
At first, I was curious about
whether the war was over

374
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,910
or what had happened to my friends.

375
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,372
But eventually, I didn't feel anything.

376
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,212
I didn't even realize
that time had passed.

377
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,132
But before I knew it, I became an adult.

378
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,220
Bang.

379
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,702
Seo-hae.

380
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,745
Yes?

381
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,791
Should we just live here together?

382
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,045
-Stop joking.
-I mean it.

383
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,133
There's enough food and medicine
for a hundred years.

384
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,845
And nobody will know that we're here.

385
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,142
If I'm gone, there won't be any uploader

386
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,768
and there won't be a war.

387
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,189
Then it will be peaceful out there.

388
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:28,277
People will be busy living their lives,
so they won't even care about us.

389
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,946
You said that before.

390
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,250
You see…

391
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,964
I had nightmares every night
while I was here.

392
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,802
About the day my mom died,

393
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,056
the nuclear bomb that I heard…

394
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,435
But you know what scared me the most?

395
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,314
The fact that the nightmare doesn't end
even when I woke up.

396
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,362
The scene, the sound…

397
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,324
I kept seeing and hearing it.

398
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,831
I prayed every night
for someone to end my nightmares.

399
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,588
And I felt like you could end them.

400
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,844
That's why I traveled in time to meet you.

401
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,643
What if…

402
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,147
What if we lose?

403
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,239
Then we'll start over in the next world.

404
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,286
We just have to get one step closer
each time we try.

405
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,748
We've come a long way,
and we'll get one step closer this time.

406
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,169
And if we keep doing that,
we'll be able to win in the end.

407
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,798
As long as we don't give up.

408
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,723
So we can't run away.

409
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,186
All right.

410
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,823
Seo-hae.

411
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,331
What have you done?

412
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,541
Seo-hae, wait.

413
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,131
Hey!

414
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,386
Wait here.
I'll come back after finishing everything.

415
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,681
Han Tae-sul. Open this door.

416
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,310
You're right. I can't keep running away.

417
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,320
What happened?

418
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,080
I saw the future.

419
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,875
You'll die if you go alone.

420
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,129
No, I can win. So don't follow me.

421
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,507
Just stay here. That's how I can win.

422
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,095
Open the door. Open this now!

423
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,228
I wanted to say goodbye properly.

424
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,072
I'm sorry, Seo-hae.

425
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,951
Don't go.

426
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,291
Don't go. Please.

427
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,710
Don't go.

428
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,558
Han Tae-sul!

429
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,064
FILTERS
VEHICLE TYPE

430
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,485
SEARCHING

431
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,155
The vehicle just passed Hangang Bridge.

432
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,406
Put it up on the screen.

433
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:34,374
43D 3494

434
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,960
-It's Han Tae-sul.
-Track him.

435
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,378
Yes, sir.

436
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,258
But he's not with the girl.

437
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,844
-What?
-Han Tae-sul's alone.

438
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,304
How long has it been?

439
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,474
It's been 18 hours
since she was last spotted.

440
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,193
Sir.

441
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,948
We have a problem.

442
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,534
The girl disappeared.

443
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,205
According to the records,
she should be with him right now,

444
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,249
but we can't find her.

445
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,794
What should we do?

446
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,754
Well…

447
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,053
HAN TAE-SUL

448
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,937
How did you get my number?

449
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,191
You should've taken better care
of your personal information.

450
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,529
-Are you--
-Listen to me carefully.

451
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,657
Everything that happens from now on
will be as I planned.

452
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,952
So you're going to be
playing into my hands now.

453
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,788
Why don't you try fighting that?
You bastard.

454
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,265
What are you waiting for? Find the girl.

455
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,683
Yes, sir.

456
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,980
It's getting interesting.

457
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,859
How will I win this time?

458
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,667
Darn it. I guess she wouldn't come here.

459
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,086
Where on earth is she?

460
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,339
Darn it.

461
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,638
Are you here?

462
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,223
Hey!

463
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,692
You scared me.

464
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,444
What are you doing?

465
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,782
Are you Chinese? Are you Japanese?

466
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,452
Food.

467
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,334
Jeez.

468
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,256
-You're Mr. Choi Jae-sun, right?
-What?

469
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,717
I'm from Immigration Control Bureau,
Team 7.

470
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,681
We have a few questions to ask you.
Please come with us.

471
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:39,309
Why? Can't we just talk here?

472
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,691
Your mother…

473
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,405
and your little sister
are in the US, right?

474
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,908
If you don't cooperate,

475
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,911
they can be forced to return to Korea.

476
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,292
Just come with us!

477
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,426
Hey, let go of me!

478
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,096
Just let me go!

479
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:21,101
Let go of me, will you?

480
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,396
Stop it, guys.
He's telling you to let go of him.

481
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:38,744
Sit.

482
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,415
Hi.

483
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,834
I'm Seo Gil-bok.

484
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,629
I guess you wouldn't know that name.

485
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,465
Sigma.

486
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,677
Have you heard that name?

487
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,805
Why does the war break out?

488
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,975
Sigma explodes a nuclear bomb.

489
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,521
Please don't kill me.

490
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,440
Who said I'm going to kill you?

491
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,276
Sit down.

492
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,238
It's nothing like that.
Sit back down. Don't worry.

493
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,995
Why would I kill an innocent person?

494
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,664
Do I look that evil to you?

495
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,417
What? No.

496
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,961
Or did Han Tae-sul tell you
that I'm the bad guy?

497
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,881
Oh, I guess he did.

498
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,968
You can't know the truth
by hearing just one side of the story.

499
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,137
How far do you know?

500
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,597
About what?

501
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,849
About me.

502
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,564
I heard that you're going to start a war.

503
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,528
Me? Why would I do that?

504
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,366
A war does break out,
but that happens all the time,

505
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,867
all over the world.

506
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,748
I'm just trying to earn some money
with uploaders.

507
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:11,002
Think about it. You can earn a lot
with those in the future.

508
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,515
Fine. Let's say what they said is true.
Let's say it's all my fault.

509
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,726
But does that affect you?

510
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:33,733
You don't care much about this country.
And it's not like you're some hero.

511
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,445
Why didn't you go to the States?

512
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,949
Because of Seo-hae?

513
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:48,248
She's a decent person
apart from being so nosy.

514
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,793
I like her too.
She's kind and she's a great fighter.

515
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,379
She's attractive.

516
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:56,882
Right.

517
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,763
But if we don't do anything,
Seo-hae's going to die

518
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,058
because of Han Tae-sul.

519
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,061
I don't want to hurt them,
but they keep coming at me.

520
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,980
I'll have no choice but to kill them.

521
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,994
I only want Han Tae-sul.

522
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,537
I don't need Seo-hae.

523
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,795
So take her and leave Korea
so she won't bother me.

524
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,717
What if

525
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,511
she doesn't listen to me?

526
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,347
Are you going to let her die, then?

527
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,517
Try to convince her, lie,
drag her, beg her.

528
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,102
Do whatever you can.

529
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,606
Then you can be together with Seo-hae.

530
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,691
And she'll live.

531
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,694
And Han Tae-sul

532
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,239
won't be near her.

533
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,503
She was last spotted near Hangang Bridge.

534
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,802
Can you think of anywhere nearby
she could be hiding?

535
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,935
You're trying to take her.

536
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,522
I can't trust

537
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:37,941
you people.

538
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,359
You little…

539
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,698
I guess I was too kind to you.

540
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:51,287
You can just die here, then.
I'll bring your mother and sister too.

541
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,715
This is your last chance,
so think carefully.

542
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,177
You keep thinking of the day
your family left Korea, right?

543
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,808
You keep regretting

544
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,853
not leaving with them, don't you?

545
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,697
Since you remind me of my past,

546
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,452
and you seem like a decent guy,
so I'm giving you one last chance.

547
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,167
All right, then.

548
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,754
Wait.

549
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,173
Yes.

550
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,136
You swear

551
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,765
you'll let Seo-hae live, right?

552
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,808
I promise.

553
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:58,980
All right.

554
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,276
I'll do it.

555
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,969
Don't drag her here.
Make her come of her own accord.

556
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,055
What should we do about Han Tae-sul?

557
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,766
I'll get him myself.

558
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,227
Where are you heading?

559
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,772
There's only one place he could go to.

560
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,358
Right.

561
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:56,246
A delegation consisting of congressmen
and Korean branch managers of US firms

562
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,874
have left from Incheon Airport
to visit the US this morning.

563
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:04,504
The delegation will assist the President,
who is in the US for a summit,

564
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,965
and promote economic revitalization

565
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:09,509
through cooperation with firms in the US.

566
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:14,848
I came to give you this.
It's the medicine for your mother.

567
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:20,103
He said that you'll get the rest
when everything is over.

568
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,982
And here's the address of the bunker
for you and your mother.

569
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,196
Thanks.

570
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,034
Are you all ready to move? Can I help?

571
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:40,248
It's just me and my mom.
There's nothing much to prepare.

572
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,166
It's fine.

573
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,793
Six months should be enough.

574
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,464
I heard the fallout will be gone by then.

575
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,425
I got everything ready
for you to go abroad after that.

576
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,177
You prefer Baltimore, right?

577
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,971
Your college friends are all there.

578
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,809
Seo-jin, should I come with you?

579
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,686
Why?

580
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,648
Well, you might need some help…

581
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,650
You know there's nothing between us now.

582
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,528
-You're making me uncomfortable.
-Seo-jin.

583
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,615
We already talked about this. I--

584
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:17,410
Seo-jin, don't just cut me off like that.

585
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,371
You can just contact me
when you need help.

586
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,042
You can just use me. I don't care

587
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,753
however you treat me.

588
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,298
So just let me stay by your side.

589
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,896
Seo-jin, can't you at least
pretend to think about it?

590
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,317
I can wait for you as long as it takes.

591
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,628
-How much is there left?
-I'm done with that side.

592
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,255
We just have to finish this side.

593
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,800
Time goes by so fast.
It's tomorrow already.

594
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,844
What do we do during the war?

595
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,388
We can't even go abroad.

596
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,015
We'll just have to get lots of sleep.

597
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,310
We really have tough lives.

598
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,857
Can't you read? It says we're closed!

599
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,408
Darn it.

600
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,584
You're up.

601
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,826
-What's the date today?
-October 30.

602
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,998
You've totally lost it.
You're getting all mixed up.

603
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,459
So why the hell do you keep going there?

604
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,170
Shut up and just give me the meds.

605
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,088
I don't have any.

606
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,801
-You don't?
-Of course not.

607
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,388
If you want to live longer,
stop wandering around so much.

608
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,475
And if you want to die soon,
you can move around.

609
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,645
Bingbing!

610
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,859
The doctor's leaving.

611
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,029
Just get lots of rest.
The war's tomorrow anyway.

612
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,116
All right, thanks. You get some rest too.

613
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,420
Where are you going?
He told you not to move.

614
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,339
You're going there again? Seriously?

615
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,132
No, I'm not.

616
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,051
Who'll take care of the shop if you die?

617
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,344
I'm not going to die!

618
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,180
The woman we saw,
she's your wife, isn't she?

619
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,892
You've been sending her three million
every month, right?

620
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,478
Why do you keep going there?

621
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,523
You always tell us
never to go looking for ourselves!

622
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,275
-You little… Move.
-No!

623
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,987
I saved your life last time.

624
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,656
Don't you know give and take?

625
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,075
I have to get something in return.

626
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,662
That's why you take something first
before you give anything.

627
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,456
People can take things
and pretend nothing happened. Move.

628
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,999
You'll die if you go there!

629
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,673
You're dying today, aren't you?

630
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,969
You said you were in jail
at the time of the war

631
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,846
because you killed someone.

632
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,681
The war's going to break out soon.

633
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,933
Who did you kill?

634
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,814
Did you kill yourself
to stop him from beating your wife?

635
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,943
Why can't you answer me?

636
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:20,820
Move.

637
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,030
Don't go!

638
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,618
-What's with you?
-Mr. Park!

639
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,836
Hey, look who's here.

640
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,840
I thought I'd never see you again.

641
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,342
Where's your girlfriend?

642
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:50,266
Right. Relationships are difficult,
aren't they?

643
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,935
-Give me a gun.
-A gun? Why?

644
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,103
To kill Sigma.

645
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,940
My gosh. How will you catch him?

646
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,068
You should've done it back then.

647
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,696
Why are you doing this
after letting him go?

648
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,991
-Just sell me a gun.
-No. I can't.

649
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:10,661
Seoul is going to be bombed soon,
and everyone's going to die.

650
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,915
Then guns are going to be really valuable.

651
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,042
Plus, I'm never selling any to you.

652
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,011
Money is just going to be toilet paper

653
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,596
once the war breaks out.

654
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,306
It's not money.

655
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,308
Open it.

656
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,403
Sir, it's medicine.

657
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,155
Antibiotics.

658
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,116
It's enough for over 50 years
after the war.

659
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,411
You've experienced it before,
so you know how precious it is.

660
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,329
Come on.

661
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:55,957
Give him a gun.

662
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,554
Do you even know how to shoot a gun?

663
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:16,143
Have you ever seen
a cornered mouse fighting a cat?

664
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:22,275
The mouse doesn't fight the cat
thinking that it'll actually win.

665
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,777
It knows it's going to die anyway.

666
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,655
But it fights
because it wants to go courageously.

667
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,199
There's a crack. Give me another one.

668
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:37,206
All right, let's say that you succeed
in getting to him.

669
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,250
But how will you kill him?

670
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:43,087
Like you said,
you're just in the palm of his hand.

671
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:47,550
Why? Because he's done this
so many times before.

672
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:50,511
It's not smooth. Give me another one.

673
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:51,888
Give him another one.

674
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,526
-All right.
-Oh, and a sniper rifle.

675
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,237
You're not Han Tae-sul, are you?

676
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,700
I'm not sure if you've heard this before.

677
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:17,705
"The future is already here.
We just don't know it yet."

678
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,786
Look at this bastard.

679
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,251
Excuse me. Just a moment.

680
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,379
-Where are you going? Working late?
-Yes.

681
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,632
Oh, why don't you just head home?

682
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:10,633
Pardon?

683
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:14,095
Just go home and keep your doors locked.

684
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,305
And make sure to close your windows.

685
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,818
Let's go home, everyone.

686
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,696
Everyone, go home.

687
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,741
The person you are calling is…

688
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,370
All Quantum &amp; Time employees.

689
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,205
Go home.

690
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,149
Why weren't you picking up?

691
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,651
I'm here.

692
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:15,781
-Welcome.
-Right. Where are you?

693
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,408
You said everything's your plan.

694
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,830
Then you should be able to find me.

695
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,349
You will make the uploader now.

696
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,645
You used this to explode the nuclear bomb.

697
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,357
Someone else will do it.
Aren't you scared of dying?

698
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,651
I am. But…

699
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,862
What scares me more
is surviving alone in the world.

700
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,616
Is this part of your grand scheme?

701
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,911
I saw the future.

702
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,288
The future where I win.

703
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:51,335
