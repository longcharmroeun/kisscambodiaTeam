1
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:15,202
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:22,794
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

3
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:30,386
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

4
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:37,894
Han Tae-sul!

5
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:40,772
Tae-sul! Come play with me!

6
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,024
What's going on?

7
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:44,527
The Control Bureau is here.

8
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:50,700
So they're openly working together now?

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,419
Seo Won-ju?

10
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:03,339
You remember me now?

11
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,346
I'm disappointed.
I've never once forgotten you.

12
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:12,516
I'm sorry. You weren't exactly memorable
back in school.

13
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:15,520
I thought you'd remember me,
even just vaguely.

14
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:17,314
We were quite close.

15
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:21,151
I'm not sure about that.
I don't recall us being close.

16
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,821
As I recall, you just followed me around.

17
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,534
It's all in the past,
so don't be so hurt by it.

18
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:33,540
Anyway, I think
we have a lot of catching up to do.

19
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,460
So you should've come alone, you prick.

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,591
Fire a warning shot.

21
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:46,931
Snipers! Keep your head down.

22
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,559
-Should we move in, sir?
-No, I'll go in alone.

23
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,813
Yes, sir. The snipers will cover you.

24
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,189
What's the plan again?

25
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:56,858
You go in and talk to them.
When they're cornered,

26
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,110
we'll take care of them.

27
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:02,949
So where are you?

28
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:07,121
Where are you now?

29
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,043
He hung up.

30
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:19,968
HONESTY, DILIGENCE, SERVICE

31
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,018
Tae-sul.

32
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,983
Where are you hiding?

33
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:37,155
Are you here?

34
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,658
Here I come.

35
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,911
I'm coming to get you!

36
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:46,456
When I catch you, you're so dead!

37
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,293
I sound scary.

38
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,589
Hide well.

39
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,718
Hey, we won't get caught today, right?

40
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,012
-No idea.
-What?

41
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,098
If we get rid of Seo Won-ju fast,
we'll win.

42
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,101
But what if someone's there waiting for us
to catch us?

43
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,478
That's possible.

44
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,063
Let's get out of here first.

45
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,019
That bastard!

46
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,689
Targets spotted in Class 1-3.

47
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,399
Class 1-3!

48
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:51,446
How come you remember him only now?
You've met him.

49
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,033
How was I supposed to remember
something from years ago?

50
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:55,826
Right, you lack social skills.

51
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,037
-Damn it.
-Han Tae-sul.

52
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,295
Watch out!

53
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:18,561
ARCHIVE ROOM

54
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:35,246
Oh, boy.

55
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,917
Tae-sul!

56
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,337
You really haven't changed one bit.

57
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,385
When you consider someone
a loser or an idiot,

58
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:51,306
you wipe the person from your memory
not to waste your brain capacity.

59
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,185
To you, everyone else is like an extra.

60
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,438
Passerby One, Two, Three.

61
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,983
Student One, Two, Three.

62
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,820
But you know what?

63
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:08,159
There might be someone that matters
among them.

64
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:12,663
Someone you're meant to be with…

65
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:19,379
or an evil bastard who will end the world.

66
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:24,427
That's why

67
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:28,890
you should never mistreat anyone.

68
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,061
That's my point.

69
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:39,027
Sir, what would you like us to do?

70
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:42,238
We just stick to the plan.

71
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:46,077
-This is insane.
-Why did we come in here?

72
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,205
This was the only place we could hide.
It was all blocked.

73
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:52,459
-You went to this school!
-Yes, I did.

74
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,879
I transferred schools a lot,
so I got confused.

75
00:05:57,005 --> 00:06:00,718
Darn it.
I don't think we can pull this off today.

76
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,306
Calm down, Seo-hae.

77
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,351
If we wait, we'll get caught.

78
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:24,495
-Are you ready?
-No.

79
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:27,456
Yes.

80
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:31,962
They can't kill you,
so they won't shoot right away.

81
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:33,630
I'll go out first.

82
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:42,265
You'll go out first, then what?

83
00:06:44,893 --> 00:06:46,061
What's wrong?

84
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:49,064
It's just odd.

85
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:50,983
What is?

86
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:53,987
Why aren't they coming in?

87
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,421
They can just barge in,
but they're waiting.

88
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,381
Why?

89
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,175
Good point.

90
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:18,181
Could it be…

91
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:24,271
Maybe last time…

92
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,982
We came out.

93
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:30,779
That's why they're waiting.

94
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:33,072
Because future events shouldn't change.

95
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,389
Seo-hae.

96
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:06,693
I always wanted to do this
at a moment like this.

97
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,408
-Hey, it's not the time to--
-Shush.

98
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,996
Just a moment.

99
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,584
Stay still for a moment.

100
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:39,439
Year 2020…

101
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:43,902
October 28.

102
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:48,241
Current time is…

103
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,538
-It's 15:50.
-What are you doing?

104
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:56,500
Current time, 15:50.

105
00:08:56,584 --> 00:09:01,506
Well, there was a man named
Stephen Hawking.

106
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,551
He's best known for his discovery
called "Hawking radiation."

107
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,386
You see, black holes…

108
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:08,598
Never mind.

109
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,934
Anyway, he secretly organized a party

110
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,981
under the premise
that time travel was possible.

111
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:19,735
Then he wrote an invitation
and spread it all over the country.

112
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:23,114
And he threw a party at that exact time.

113
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:26,367
He thought that
if there really was a time machine,

114
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:30,205
people would see the invitation
in the future and come to the party.

115
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,253
You mean, someone in the future
might see this and come to your rescue?

116
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,048
Yes.

117
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:44,054
Why aren't they coming out?

118
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:52,898
Excuse me.

119
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,950
HAN TAE-SUL

120
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:05,995
GANG SEO-HAE

121
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:14,630
HELP US

122
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,218
"On October 28, 2020, at 15:50.

123
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:22,306
Han Tae-sul and Gang Seo-hae,
trapped here and in danger.

124
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,849
Help us."

125
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:26,644
It's done.

126
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,063
And? Did anyone come?

127
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,357
What?

128
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,615
-What was that?
-Hey, what's going on?

129
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:39,117
We're trying to find out…

130
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,246
Gosh, what is happening?

131
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:44,205
Hush.

132
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,714
Our snipers are all… We're getting sniped!

133
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,100
It's dangerous. We should leave.

134
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,408
I guess it worked.

135
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:18,494
-What?
-Someone came to help us.

136
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:37,140
It changed. I wonder who came.

137
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:40,603
Sir.

138
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,776
Mr. Han!

139
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:01,126
Who's this?

140
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,046
Come to the east exit.
I'll wait for you in the car.

141
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,857
What? That's my car.

142
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:34,831
Get in.

143
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:36,958
Bong-seon?

144
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:47,804
-Yeo Bong-seon.
-Sir.

145
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:48,721
Gosh, you…

146
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:55,437
Hey, what happened?

147
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:59,316
Bong-seon!

148
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:05,907
Bong-seon, are you all right?

149
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:07,409
I'm fine.

150
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,089
Does this use electricity?

151
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:22,175
No, kerosene.
It's smuggled into the country.

152
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,019
Why are you helping us?

153
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,772
Because of the war.
How will you stop it from happening?

154
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:41,615
Why did you try to save Han Tae-sul
at PEXCO?

155
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,161
-Me?
-You told him to get down

156
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:46,746
just before the shot was fired.

157
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:49,415
I got shot and fell
into a vegetative state.

158
00:13:49,498 --> 00:13:51,751
I've been pretty pissed about it
ever since.

159
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:54,213
So tell me the truth or go home.

160
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:00,386
Come on, tell me.

161
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:04,933
I found a letter.

162
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:09,939
It said I should go to Busan
and that Tae-sul would be sniped.

163
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,610
It also said the past and the future
keep on repeating

164
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:16,696
and that I must stop the war this time.

165
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,114
Who sent the letter?

166
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:20,742
Someone you can trust?

167
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,497
Who sent the letter?

168
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,375
Me. I found it in my grave.

169
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:31,463
-Where?
-At Mapo Hospital.

170
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,466
North of the Hangang Bridge,
near the army camp.

171
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,468
Are we good now?

172
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:38,346
Then why did the war break out again?

173
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,351
I'll stop it this time.

174
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:45,271
"This time"?

175
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,525
I don't know what's going on
in the countryside.

176
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,278
Metropolitan areas
are under Sigma's control.

177
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:40,416
The thugs that were after you
also work for Sigma.

178
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:44,795
They won't let you get on the uploader.

179
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,134
Then what do we do?

180
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:52,346
Follow Subway Line 5
all the way to Achasan Station.

181
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,265
There's an uploader bunker underground.

182
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:08,323
I'll show you the underground passage
to the uploader.

183
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:09,991
But why?

184
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,037
Because this girl saved my boss.

185
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:18,167
-You're not coming with us?
-No.

186
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,087
-Why not?
-Because I'm dead there.

187
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:24,383
I couldn't protect Mr. Han.
Going back would be pointless.

188
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,675
But still.

189
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,886
Some jerks will tail you.

190
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:29,805
I'll stall them, so hurry.

191
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:52,941
Everyone came down here
when the war broke out.

192
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:55,527
In emergencies,

193
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:58,947
subway stations were used
as air raid shelters.

194
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:02,327
"Emergencies"? What does that mean?

195
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,207
Like when a disaster hits unexpectedly.

196
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,542
What's an air raid shelter?

197
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:12,546
Oh, it's like our bunker.

198
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:14,256
I see.

199
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,758
Most of them would have died.

200
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,096
They had nothing to eat or drink.

201
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:20,498
What about you?

202
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,417
I had some earlier.

203
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:46,903
No.

204
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:51,366
The radiation level is too high downtown.

205
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,255
Want to hear a story?

206
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:12,515
It was a long time ago,
before you were born.

207
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:16,395
When your mom wanted to have a kid,

208
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,148
I was against it.

209
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:21,567
Seriously?

210
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,946
Even just taking care of myself
felt like a struggle.

211
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:28,867
So having children and raising them…

212
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:32,580
I didn't think I could do it.

213
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:42,633
But my whole world changed
the moment you were born.

214
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:45,970
No matter how stressed I am,

215
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:48,765
the moment I hear you call me Dad,

216
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:51,559
all my stress melts away.

217
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,069
You taught me
the true meaning of happiness.

218
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:06,910
Thanks to you, I can smile every day.

219
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:14,252
You've given me such joy, but I haven't
been able to do the same for you.

220
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:16,463
I've always felt so bad about it.

221
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:20,300
Cops get paid peanuts, you know.

222
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:23,763
What does that mean?

223
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:27,767
It means the pay is low.

224
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:29,936
I see.

225
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:36,068
When I couldn't do the things
other parents do for their kids,

226
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:37,278
I felt heartbroken.

227
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,450
"What if she does poorly in school,
just like me?

228
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:45,370
What if she can't get a job
and feels dejected?

229
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:51,752
What if she shows up with some weirdo
one day and says he's her boyfriend?"

230
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:53,839
Come on.

231
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:56,925
I was always worried.

232
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:07,145
But I guess I was much happier back then
despite all the worries.

233
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:18,617
It's all my fault.

234
00:22:21,745 --> 00:22:23,664
Why is it your fault?

235
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:29,128
Seo-hae, promise me one thing.

236
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:31,590
What?

237
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:37,888
Even if you get there safely,
do not meet Han Tae-sul, ever.

238
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:48,275
Let's go.

239
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,977
ACHASAN

240
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:29,989
He said it's underground.

241
00:23:30,072 --> 00:23:32,284
If we get surrounded there,
we're finished.

242
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,037
It's over there.

243
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,793
We should spread out.

244
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:40,861
Dad!

245
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:52,374
Dad, are you all right?

246
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,126
I'm fine. Just go!

247
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:16,568
I'll meet you there!

248
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:03,994
If it weren't for the war,

249
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,080
we wouldn't be in this mess.

250
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,672
Go.

251
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:16,842
I said, go!

252
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:38,115
Let's go.

253
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,535
-Are we at the right place?
-Not sure.

254
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,223
There's water here.

255
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,773
Dad, what is this place?

256
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:22,567
A swimming pool.

257
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,078
Let's get out that door.

258
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:36,166
-There's no water to drink out there.
-Don't let it get to you.

259
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:43,591
So I said, "Han Tae-sul!

260
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:53,102
Is it the girl or the world?"

261
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:58,024
Then that idiot broke into tears.

262
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:01,904
Seo-hae. Gang Seo-hae!

263
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:09,746
Hands up! Put your hands up!

264
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,414
Drop your guns!

265
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,210
-Drop your guns!
-Drop your guns.

266
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:40,322
Look who's here.

267
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:34,967
I used to hate crowds and traffic jams.

268
00:34:35,468 --> 00:34:37,136
There are no cars in the future.

269
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:39,806
Hey, are you all right?

270
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:43,268
Don't mind me.

271
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:47,148
I won't last long. I wasn't feeling well
when I was crossing over.

272
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:51,236
When I woke up,

273
00:34:52,654 --> 00:34:55,616
I learned the country no longer exists
because of the war.

274
00:34:57,117 --> 00:34:58,702
It happened so suddenly.

275
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,957
At first, I resented you a lot.

276
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:04,542
I'm sorry.

277
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:08,129
Later on, I found out

278
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:11,842
that you fought against Sigma

279
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:14,929
and kept me on life support.

280
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:21,270
So I retraced your steps.

281
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:25,191
From your home and office

282
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,360
to your elementary school.

283
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:30,488
That's where I found it.

284
00:35:31,824 --> 00:35:32,992
Your message.

285
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,334
Sir.

286
00:35:42,002 --> 00:35:42,919
Yes.

287
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:46,757
Don't fight.

288
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:50,553
You can't beat Sigma.

289
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:55,183
I saw graves. Yours and that girl's.

290
00:35:57,102 --> 00:35:58,312
I know.

291
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,022
Run away.

292
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,277
This time, I won't die.

293
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:07,864
You know,
there's no problem that I can't solve.

294
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,918
Sigma knows everything.

295
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:22,922
What will happen,
even when and where it'll take place.

296
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:26,010
Gosh.

297
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,138
Bong-seon.

298
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:33,560
Do you really want to beat Sigma?

299
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:35,812
Of course.

300
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,190
Even if you'll die?

301
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:50,079
What's this?

302
00:36:55,794 --> 00:36:57,629
Use it as a last resort.

303
00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:00,590
Open it when you have no other option.

304
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,979
How beautiful.

305
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,694
I wanted to see this again.

306
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,576
Mr. Han.

307
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,752
I'll be off, then.

308
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,005
Bong-seon.

309
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:42,721
Bong-seon! Hey!

310
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,478
Bong-seon.

311
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:50,355
Bong-seon!

312
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:55,653
Darn it.

313
00:38:23,476 --> 00:38:27,063
Jae-sun, Mom wants you to bring
a lot of gochujang and doenjang.

314
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:29,274
They're at Korean supermarkets.

315
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:30,609
But they're expensive here.

316
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:32,445
All right.

317
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,532
-Did you buy the eyebrow razor yet?
-Oh, right. Not yet.

318
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:38,785
Hey! I told you to bring it.

319
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:40,037
I can't find it here.

320
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:43,332
What do girls here use
to shape their eyebrows?

321
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:46,168
And get me every cushion compact
and lip tint that you see.

322
00:38:47,712 --> 00:38:48,713
Okay.

323
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,715
You're coming, right?

324
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:52,592
Yes, of course.

325
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:54,178
When are you coming?

326
00:38:57,973 --> 00:39:01,228
-Are you staying there because of her?
-No, I have to do something.

327
00:39:01,895 --> 00:39:03,980
Jae-sun, can I give you a word of advice?

328
00:39:04,064 --> 00:39:05,315
No, don't.

329
00:39:05,398 --> 00:39:09,195
Since I'm a girl too,
I can tell she has no feelings for you.

330
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:10,446
I never asked.

331
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,032
She's not interested in you at all.
You know, right?

332
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:17,079
You keep hitting on her,
so she gets awkward and feels bad for you.

333
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:19,373
That's why she can't
flat out turn you down.

334
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:21,792
You're making her uncomfortable.

335
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:25,630
Gosh, you little brat.
Can you stop being so blunt?

336
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:29,842
So stop bending over backward for her.
Just come to the US, you idiot.

337
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:31,554
Something might happen there.

338
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,098
What? How do you know?

339
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:37,059
The Embassy warned
all the American citizens to return

340
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,519
because there may be a war.

341
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,860
Mom's here. If she sees your face,
she'll make a huge fuss again.

342
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:48,322
Book a flight right away
and send me a screenshot.

343
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:50,324
If you don't, you're so dead.

344
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:51,826
CALL ENDED

345
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:38,420
-What happened? Reinstall the program.
-Can you check this?

346
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,257
-Check for a short circuit.
-Yes, sir.

347
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:53,145
It worked last time.

348
00:40:53,812 --> 00:40:56,149
They're making a huge fuss about this!

349
00:40:58,485 --> 00:41:02,114
Mr. Han got rid of all the relevant data.

350
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:05,201
But you guys made this with him,
so you can do it again!

351
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:07,370
There are 70 of you!

352
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,251
Tae-sul did this all by himself.

353
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:15,504
He designed it all on his own!

354
00:41:17,006 --> 00:41:20,426
When he was only 15, with a pencil!

355
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:26,975
What? What's your problem?

356
00:41:28,227 --> 00:41:30,729
Why don't you do it yourself
if you need it so urgently?

357
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,277
Stop yelling. Just do it yourself.

358
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:38,989
Tae-sul.

359
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:41,575
Oh, maybe you can't.

360
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,426
Hey, why are you here?

361
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:58,886
Sir.

362
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:57,787
It's been a while.

363
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:00,539
I came to see you one last time.

364
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:06,129
QUANTUM &amp; TIME FAILS
HIGH MOLECULAR TRANSPORT EXPERIMENT

365
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,173
Did you drink?

366
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:15,848
I first met Tae-sul
when I was preparing for my postdoc.

367
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:20,604
I overheard the professors' conversation
in the lab.

368
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:24,150
They talked about a student
who got in through early admission

369
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,988
and whose dissertation was approved
as soon as he got in.

370
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:30,406
You see,

371
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:35,329
it took me eight years.

372
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,877
Do you know what is
the best decision I've ever made?

373
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:47,134
Working with Tae-sul when everyone else
hated him and was jealous of him.

374
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:50,972
Believing him when no one else took him

375
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:53,766
seriously.

376
00:43:55,686 --> 00:43:57,187
What are you trying to say?

377
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:01,400
I'm not trying to say anything. I'm just…

378
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:04,237
a little exhausted.

379
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:20,672
Come to think of it,

380
00:44:22,757 --> 00:44:25,052
you and Tae-sul almost got married.

381
00:44:28,556 --> 00:44:31,058
I don't think
I can handle anything anymore.

382
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:34,688
I don't want to do anything.

383
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:38,317
Do you want to beat Tae-sul?

384
00:44:44,866 --> 00:44:48,329
Last time, you asked me
what was really happening.

385
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:53,125
If you want to know, come with me.

386
00:44:54,753 --> 00:44:56,212
But remember.

387
00:44:56,713 --> 00:44:58,256
Once you decide to come with me,

388
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,802
there's no going back.

389
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:18,112
OCTOBER 28, 2020
AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, SNIPERS…

390
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:34,130
Mr. Han.

391
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:36,549
I'll be off, then.

392
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,052
Bong-seon! Hey!

393
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,519
GANG DONG-GI

394
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:56,280
Hello?

395
00:45:56,948 --> 00:45:59,826
I looked up that man, Seo Won-ju.

396
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:02,204
He's not even in the system anymore.

397
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:03,622
I see.

398
00:46:03,706 --> 00:46:06,750
So I asked our information division
to look further into it.

399
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:11,047
He'd applied for registration of
an artist name for copyright registration.

400
00:46:12,298 --> 00:46:13,550
What's that name?

401
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:17,221
It's Seo Gil-bok.

402
00:46:18,264 --> 00:46:19,557
GANG DONG-GI

403
00:46:21,642 --> 00:46:23,060
Seo Gil-bok?

404
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:26,022
SEOUL GANGBUK POLICE STATION

405
00:46:26,106 --> 00:46:29,109
MOST TRUSTED POLICE
FOR SAFEST GANGBUK

406
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:34,323
Jeez, he's here again.
He practically lives here.

407
00:46:46,295 --> 00:46:48,590
The victim said
you shouldn't expect any leniency.

408
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:49,758
STATEMENT
SEO GIL-BOK

409
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,636
So you're a painter.
That's why you're so expressive.

410
00:46:54,221 --> 00:46:55,806
Your comments are so catchy.

411
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,143
Hey, think about how stressed out
the victim must be.

412
00:46:59,226 --> 00:47:01,395
You posted malicious comments
for seven years!

413
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:04,524
It's more than 5,000 sheets of A4 paper,
you jerk!

414
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:06,818
Think about celebrities' suicides.

415
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:09,029
Posting malicious comments is like murder!

416
00:47:10,865 --> 00:47:12,492
I'm sorry.

417
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:16,287
"I didn't like the way
Han Tae-sul looked at me."

418
00:47:17,122 --> 00:47:19,249
Oh, do you know him personally?

419
00:47:24,714 --> 00:47:26,633
-Yes.
-Hey.

420
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:28,676
Even I know who Han Tae-sul is.

421
00:47:29,511 --> 00:47:31,137
Everyone in the country does.

422
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:34,725
Do you have any mental issues?

423
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:37,645
Go get a medical certificate.

424
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:39,773
It could be a mitigating factor.

425
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,858
I'm sorry.

426
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,158
You've been posting hate comments
about him since 2013.

427
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,786
I see you were released
with a warning in 2016.

428
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,958
This time, Han Tae-sul said
no leniency whatsoever.

429
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,837
So this case will go to trial.
You might get a jail sentence.

430
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,717
If you don't want that,
submit a letter of apology.

431
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,149
I apologize.

432
00:48:18,775 --> 00:48:21,820
I've been continuously posting
malicious comments

433
00:48:21,903 --> 00:48:26,367
about Quantum &amp; Time CEO,
Mr. Han Tae-sul, since 2013.

434
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:31,999
I didn't stop even after being caught
and released with a warning in 2016.

435
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:37,296
I did it because of my personal grudge
and misunderstanding.

436
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:40,341
I apologize for damaging

437
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:44,512
Mr. Han's reputation
and hurting his feelings.

438
00:48:44,596 --> 00:48:46,431
Mom!

439
00:48:46,514 --> 00:48:48,142
I regret my actions.

440
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:52,980
I was jealous of Mr. Han Tae-sul
for becoming so successful,

441
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:56,192
wealthy, and popular at such a young age.

442
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:00,322
That's why I posted
such malicious comments about him.

443
00:49:02,408 --> 00:49:05,077
I regret my petty, childish actions.

444
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:11,293
I sincerely apologize.

445
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,880
Unlike Mr. Han Tae-sul,
I did poorly in school.

446
00:49:14,963 --> 00:49:16,840
I apologize for my incompetence.

447
00:49:18,051 --> 00:49:19,928
I apologize to the judge

448
00:49:21,137 --> 00:49:23,306
as well as to my mother.

449
00:49:26,477 --> 00:49:29,188
I should have known
how to fix a falling airplane

450
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:31,815
and how to make a lot of money
like Han Tae-sul does.

451
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,152
I'm sorry for not being able to do so.

452
00:49:35,862 --> 00:49:37,447
I'm truly sorry.

453
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,743
I'm sorry that

454
00:49:42,244 --> 00:49:44,622
I'm not as capable as Tae-sul is.

455
00:49:46,457 --> 00:49:48,085
Those eyes…

456
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:51,546
Don't look at me like that.

457
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,218
I'm sorry for being born in this world.

458
00:49:59,555 --> 00:50:01,349
I'm sorry things didn't go as planned.

459
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:04,812
I'll make sure everything goes
without a hitch from now on.

460
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,026
It's okay.
We were going to lose them soon anyway.

461
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:16,199
I'll always win in the end,
regardless of how the process changes.

462
00:50:19,662 --> 00:50:22,123
Wait, is the package
supposed to arrive today?

463
00:50:23,874 --> 00:50:27,963
My gosh, I've always wanted to do it.
It'll be fun!

464
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:29,589
What's the date today?

465
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:33,136
-It's October 29.
-Right.

466
00:50:36,764 --> 00:50:38,182
You see,

467
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,813
I thought this misery would end if I died.

468
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:47,861
So I looked up ways to do it.
Hanging yourself is the cheapest.

469
00:50:49,237 --> 00:50:50,447
Funny, right?

470
00:50:51,031 --> 00:50:55,369
Rich folks can buy guns or drugs
and die gracefully.

471
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:59,248
But poor people have to think about
the cost to die.

472
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:05,797
Although I had decided
to take my own life,

473
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:11,262
I was still scared.

474
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:19,480
HARDWARE STORE

475
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:25,862
CHARCOAL BRIQUETTES

476
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,378
So I was going to

477
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,466
just give up if I came across

478
00:51:45,509 --> 00:51:48,179
even just one person

479
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,474
who told me not to die.

480
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:55,979
In hindsight,

481
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:59,733
if anyone tried to talk me out of it
back then…

482
00:52:00,692 --> 00:52:02,320
Your total is 17,500 won.

483
00:52:03,696 --> 00:52:07,951
Then maybe the world
wouldn't have fallen to pieces.

484
00:52:23,176 --> 00:52:24,136
How's it going?

485
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,722
It's strange.

486
00:52:26,806 --> 00:52:28,432
What is? Everything's working fine.

487
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:32,062
The downloader is open,
but no one has come in the past 48 hours.

488
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:34,022
The uploader must be closed.

489
00:52:35,774 --> 00:52:39,027
Oh, I see one coming.
What are the coordinates?

490
00:52:43,575 --> 00:52:44,576
It's here.

491
00:52:45,577 --> 00:52:47,496
-Our store.
-What?

492
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:53,460
What's going on?

493
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,632
No idea.

494
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:32,756
What?

495
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:37,385
-This is it?
-I guess so.

496
00:53:52,945 --> 00:53:55,823
-Wait. Let's not open it.
-Go away.

497
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:08,629
Everything from the future is mine,
you punk.

498
00:54:20,726 --> 00:54:21,936
Gosh!

499
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:26,984
What is this?

500
00:54:28,026 --> 00:54:29,528
Damn…

501
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:53,179
Don't look at me like that.

502
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:12,827
I'm sorry.

503
00:55:14,495 --> 00:55:15,955
I really am.

504
00:55:17,374 --> 00:55:19,126
I'm truly sorry.

505
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:58,879
Damn it…

506
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:25,701
Hello?

507
00:56:26,577 --> 00:56:28,246
Didn't you get my message?

508
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:31,124
I was preoccupied with something.

509
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:33,419
Your painting's been just sold.

510
00:56:34,586 --> 00:56:35,546
What?

511
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:42,554
What painting?

512
00:56:42,637 --> 00:56:45,014
Remember your self-portrait? That one.

513
00:56:45,724 --> 00:56:49,186
Didn't you say the exhibition was over?

514
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,814
Yes, but someone contacted us

515
00:56:51,897 --> 00:56:53,858
wanting to purchase it.

516
00:56:58,321 --> 00:56:59,698
Hello?

517
00:57:00,907 --> 00:57:01,825
Hello?

518
00:57:04,328 --> 00:57:05,705
Hello?

519
00:57:10,586 --> 00:57:11,712
Gil-bok?

520
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:17,719
This person is famous.
I'm sure you know him.

521
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:23,308
Who is it?

522
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:28,022
You know Quantum &amp; Time CEO, right?
Mr. Han Tae-sul.

523
00:57:31,692 --> 00:57:34,738
Hello? Are you there?

524
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,073
Han Tae-sul.

525
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,496
Seo Won-ju, hands up and on your knees.

526
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:21,958
What?

527
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,221
Hands up and on your knees!

528
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:34,305
What the hell?

529
00:58:37,475 --> 00:58:38,768
I'm sorry, Tae-sul!

530
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:41,647
I was out of my mind
when I posted those mean comments.

531
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,694
-What's he talking about?
-No idea.

532
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:50,907
Hey, Tae-sul.
I heard you bought my painting.

533
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:52,325
I bought it to find you.

534
00:58:52,993 --> 00:58:54,202
Let's finish this quickly.

535
00:59:03,005 --> 00:59:04,172
Wait!

536
00:59:04,256 --> 00:59:06,466
We have no hard feelings towards you now,

537
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:10,054
but we must do this because of the things
that you'll do in the future.

538
00:59:10,763 --> 00:59:14,893
Tae-sul, this is a prank, right?

539
00:59:14,976 --> 00:59:17,771
You know,
I even wrote a letter of apology.

540
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,940
I'll never do it again. I'm really sorry.

541
00:59:31,995 --> 00:59:32,830
What's wrong?

542
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:37,501
-I just saw something weird.
-What did you see?

543
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:40,088
Something's wrong.

544
00:59:49,307 --> 00:59:50,850
Give me that. I'll do it.

545
00:59:56,857 --> 01:00:00,110
-Tae-sul, please…
-Shut it.

546
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:09,079
JAAE HOSPITAL
INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM

547
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,512
This is Jaae Hospital.
You wanted to bring me here?

548
01:00:23,595 --> 01:00:26,224
-There's a gathering.
-What gathering?

549
01:00:27,433 --> 01:00:29,143
Simply put, it's like

550
01:00:29,227 --> 01:00:32,563
a gathering of people
who have control over Korea.

551
01:00:33,065 --> 01:00:33,983
Something like that.

552
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:37,152
-At this hospital?
-Yes.

553
01:00:39,738 --> 01:00:41,491
I clearly warned you

554
01:00:42,325 --> 01:00:44,744
that there's no going back.

555
01:00:48,207 --> 01:00:49,166
Follow me.

556
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:27,501
What are you doing? Come on.

557
01:01:47,607 --> 01:01:48,942
My point exactly!

558
01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:52,321
Prime Minister Kim!
Stop worrying about what others think.

559
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:53,447
It shows.

560
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,907
Yes, sir.

561
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:58,495
We'll just argue a little
and reconcile at the end.

562
01:01:58,578 --> 01:02:00,413
They already know the plan.

563
01:02:00,497 --> 01:02:03,209
Jeez. I should have become an assemblyman

564
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:05,503
and made you the Prime Minister instead.

565
01:02:05,586 --> 01:02:08,631
Goodness.
You insisted on taking it up yourself

566
01:02:08,714 --> 01:02:10,926
because it's the highest position!

567
01:02:11,009 --> 01:02:14,054
I didn't know
I'd have no real power to do anything.

568
01:02:24,398 --> 01:02:27,319
Wait, isn't that the Prime Minister?

569
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:29,154
Yes.

570
01:02:30,531 --> 01:02:33,201
The Minister of Economy and Finance.
The Minister of Land.

571
01:02:33,743 --> 01:02:36,996
I thought Assemblyman Kim
and Assemblyman Hong were on bad terms.

572
01:02:41,961 --> 01:02:43,671
Jeez.

573
01:02:45,297 --> 01:02:47,466
Oh, come on.

574
01:03:10,075 --> 01:03:13,454
-Let's see it.
-Come on!

575
01:03:13,538 --> 01:03:15,456
-Hey, come on.
-I need a break.

576
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,052
PACIFIC SAURY

577
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,227
We must make sure
no one's looking at the sky

578
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,355
when the missile hits.

579
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:40,903
They have to be busy fighting that
they won't even know what killed them.

580
01:03:41,862 --> 01:03:42,946
Like fireworks.

581
01:03:43,614 --> 01:03:46,825
You see them going off, but no one knows
where they're coming from.

582
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:51,623
Boom.

583
01:03:51,706 --> 01:03:54,584
I'll make sure everyone here
can watch it in the best seats.

584
01:03:55,084 --> 01:03:58,130
You missed it last time
because you were all in jail.

585
01:03:58,214 --> 01:03:59,924
So you have to see it this time.

586
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:04,221
What missile?

587
01:04:06,598 --> 01:04:10,519
Does this mean
everything Tae-sul said was true?

588
01:04:11,896 --> 01:04:13,147
Who's that guy?

589
01:04:15,483 --> 01:04:16,317
Sigma.

590
01:04:19,947 --> 01:04:21,907
Dr. Kim, I was waiting for you.

591
01:04:22,616 --> 01:04:23,700
I'm sorry I'm late.

592
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,372
-Is everyone here?
-Mr. Park isn't here yet.

593
01:04:28,373 --> 01:04:29,832
He's been expelled.

594
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:33,170
Dr. Kim, I see that you brought a friend.

595
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,173
-What's his name?
-He's Eddy Kim.

596
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:39,677
Right, Eddy Kim.

597
01:04:40,387 --> 01:04:42,472
Eddy, you're the one making the uploader.

598
01:04:44,182 --> 01:04:45,308
I'm honored to meet you.

599
01:04:46,059 --> 01:04:47,519
Welcome him with a big hand.

600
01:05:04,372 --> 01:05:07,000
140 JUNGGYESAN, SEOUL
GANG SEO-HAE

601
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,086
Do we have to take this to her?

602
01:05:10,169 --> 01:05:12,214
Can't we tell her to come pick it up?

603
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:14,842
I need to see what's happening!

604
01:05:14,925 --> 01:05:16,677
The temperature is lower today.

605
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,263
You clueless brat.

606
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:20,348
With his visit to the US fast approaching,

607
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:24,853
the President held a cabinet meeting
and asked every minister

608
01:05:24,936 --> 01:05:28,399
-to make sure all government affairs…
-Jeez, shut up.

609
01:05:28,482 --> 01:05:29,942
Same thing over and over.

610
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:37,784
Hey, Bingbing.
Want to hear an interesting story?

611
01:05:39,786 --> 01:05:45,168
People say that
every public official is a thief.

612
01:05:45,835 --> 01:05:48,505
The Prime Minister,
the Deputy Prime Minister,

613
01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:50,966
all the ministers, and assemblymen.

614
01:05:52,968 --> 01:05:54,136
Actually, it's true.

615
01:05:56,306 --> 01:05:59,809
They're all from the future.
The advance team.

616
01:06:01,811 --> 01:06:05,232
We were in jail,
so we managed to stay healthy.

617
01:06:05,316 --> 01:06:09,028
Those bastards were all behind bars.

618
01:06:09,111 --> 01:06:12,324
They're all despicable thieves,
I'm telling you.

619
01:06:13,158 --> 01:06:14,284
Gosh.

620
01:06:18,456 --> 01:06:19,791
What?

621
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,211
It's just that you said they're thieves.

622
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:26,465
That's right, those thieves.

623
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:30,135
Everyone.

624
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:34,516
There's something you need to see.
Put it on.

625
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:01,421
-That's Tae-sul.
-Stay seated.

626
01:07:02,964 --> 01:07:04,883
I told you. There's no going back.

627
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:08,971
That's me.

628
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:16,438
I really thought I was going to die
at that moment.

629
01:07:18,232 --> 01:07:19,692
Oh, boy.

630
01:07:25,281 --> 01:07:28,326
Tae-sul, why are you doing this to me?
Please stop.

631
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:29,911
Be quiet.

632
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,629
Are you all right?

633
01:08:00,362 --> 01:08:02,406
That's enough, Mr. Han. All right?

634
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,543
Well, how have you been?

635
01:08:24,097 --> 01:08:26,935
That time, I was just too flustered.

636
01:08:27,018 --> 01:08:30,396
I think you blabbered on about
how you found me,

637
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,439
but I can't remember.

638
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,944
Why are you all quiet?

639
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:39,823
Just because.
It's nice to hear your voice.

640
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,870
Can I ask you how you found me?

641
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,164
Your painting.

642
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:50,670
I'm the one who bought
the only painting of yours that sold.

643
01:08:52,713 --> 01:08:53,631
I see!

644
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:57,803
They gave me your address as soon as
I said I wanted to donate some money.

645
01:08:57,886 --> 01:08:58,720
Oh, I see.

646
01:08:58,804 --> 01:09:01,431
But don't get the wrong idea.

647
01:09:01,515 --> 01:09:04,519
I didn't buy it because I liked it.
And the reviews were bad.

648
01:09:06,187 --> 01:09:08,898
Tae-sul, who are you talking to?

649
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:09,983
Be quiet.

650
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:14,572
I showed your painting
to various art critics

651
01:09:14,655 --> 01:09:18,410
to see how good you are as an artist.

652
01:09:19,244 --> 01:09:22,372
I have their feedback on my phone now.
Want to hear it?

653
01:09:22,455 --> 01:09:24,082
You're probably curious.

654
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:31,716
I'll read them out to you one by one.

655
01:09:33,427 --> 01:09:35,429
"Frankly,
it isn't a well-executed painting.

656
01:09:35,512 --> 01:09:39,141
The quality of the canvas
and the oil paint is top-notch,

657
01:09:39,224 --> 01:09:41,519
but the brushstrokes look pretty clumsy.

658
01:09:41,603 --> 01:09:45,648
Using high-quality supplies is important,
but this artist needs more practice."

659
01:09:45,732 --> 01:09:46,858
You need more practice.

660
01:09:48,235 --> 01:09:49,528
Are you talking about me?

661
01:09:49,612 --> 01:09:53,324
"The colors are too simple.
The painter doesn't know how to use light.

662
01:09:53,407 --> 01:09:54,867
He's not a professional artist.

663
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:57,579
He's probably just someone
with an art degree."

664
01:09:57,662 --> 01:09:59,873
Stop. That's enough.

665
01:09:59,956 --> 01:10:01,625
"The concept isn't bad.

666
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,711
He depicted his imagination in detail."

667
01:10:03,794 --> 01:10:06,922
But it's not your imagination.
You painted what you saw.

668
01:10:07,006 --> 01:10:09,133
So this one doesn't count.

669
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:13,138
There's more. "It's kitschy."

670
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:15,557
Well, that means it's not good.

671
01:10:16,433 --> 01:10:19,437
"I'm not trying to belittle the work,
but it looks like something

672
01:10:20,355 --> 01:10:23,232
you'd see at a barbershop."
He's clearly belittling it.

673
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:25,652
"I think he worked hard on it."

674
01:10:25,736 --> 01:10:26,904
It's the only compliment.

675
01:10:26,987 --> 01:10:29,365
I said, stop.

676
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:33,912
What's going to happen if I shoot you now?

677
01:10:33,995 --> 01:10:35,747
Will the future you disappear?

678
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,878
You can't shoot me.
That's why I'm here, alive and well.

679
01:10:40,961 --> 01:10:42,505
Oh, really?

680
01:10:43,798 --> 01:10:45,675
Then let's see what happens.

681
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,677
I heard you met your brother.

682
01:10:56,104 --> 01:10:57,730
Let me put it simply.

683
01:10:59,607 --> 01:11:01,609
If he's hiding somewhere in his past,

684
01:11:01,693 --> 01:11:04,613
his body must be somewhere in the present.

685
01:11:12,497 --> 01:11:14,999
I'm sure my boys are
taking good care of him.

686
01:11:17,544 --> 01:11:18,879
If you spare me now,

687
01:11:18,963 --> 01:11:21,173
you can go back to the past and bring him,

688
01:11:22,258 --> 01:11:24,135
like you did with that girl.

689
01:11:25,929 --> 01:11:26,763
What's wrong?

690
01:11:27,431 --> 01:11:30,267
Right, there's another reason
you shouldn't kill me today.

691
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:31,476
If you shoot me now,

692
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,439
the girl will disappear as well.

693
01:11:35,273 --> 01:11:36,607
Can you really do it?

694
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:43,115
I mean, are you sure you're ready?

695
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:47,369
To part with her and never see her again?

696
01:11:49,456 --> 01:11:53,460
You still have lots of time left.
You need to say a proper goodbye.

697
01:11:54,127 --> 01:11:58,382
As for me,
you can kill me next time you see me.

698
01:12:01,343 --> 01:12:02,470
Tae-sul.

699
01:12:03,597 --> 01:12:05,307
Tae-sul, don't listen to him.

700
01:12:06,349 --> 01:12:07,726
This is our only chance.

701
01:12:09,394 --> 01:12:12,356
If you shoot me now,
you'll be left with nothing.

702
01:12:13,316 --> 01:12:15,735
Everything and everyone you love
will vanish.

703
01:12:17,612 --> 01:12:19,323
So today…

704
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:23,035
Just protect me, all right?

705
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,710
Hey, what's going on?

706
01:12:51,192 --> 01:12:54,862
Seo-hae, let's just leave.

707
01:12:54,946 --> 01:12:56,240
What?

708
01:12:58,325 --> 01:13:00,118
Let's just leave.

709
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,582
My gosh!

710
01:13:08,545 --> 01:13:10,505
What are you doing here?

711
01:13:12,341 --> 01:13:14,468
My, look at that.

712
01:13:15,177 --> 01:13:18,890
That jerk, Sigma, looked so sly
even when he was young.

713
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:20,976
What are you doing here?

714
01:13:22,352 --> 01:13:25,689
Me? Oh, to deliver this package.

715
01:13:25,772 --> 01:13:27,191
Bingbing, hand it over.

716
01:13:28,276 --> 01:13:30,361
We downloaded it an hour ago.

717
01:13:31,737 --> 01:13:33,114
It came to our store.

718
01:13:35,075 --> 01:13:38,161
Well, I was going to just ignore it.

719
01:13:38,245 --> 01:13:39,788
But I figured

720
01:13:40,706 --> 01:13:43,042
it would be important to you, so…

721
01:13:45,753 --> 01:13:46,880
What is it?

722
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:12,159
What happened?

723
01:15:02,674 --> 01:15:04,343
Seo-hae, no.

724
01:15:04,426 --> 01:15:05,719
Move.

725
01:15:06,804 --> 01:15:08,263
-Seo-hae.
-I said, move.

726
01:15:08,931 --> 01:15:10,182
-Calm down.
-Move, now.

727
01:15:10,849 --> 01:15:12,102
Calm down, please.

728
01:15:13,687 --> 01:15:15,522
What did you do to my dad?

729
01:15:16,189 --> 01:15:18,316
-What?
-What did you do to my dad?

730
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,487
Seo-hae, put the gun down. Put it down!

731
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,989
What did that bastard say?

732
01:15:24,115 --> 01:15:25,616
Why are you acting like this?

733
01:15:27,077 --> 01:15:29,329
Let's just go. There's another chance.

734
01:15:29,413 --> 01:15:32,124
No. There isn't another chance.

735
01:15:32,207 --> 01:15:36,879
Hey, you two!
You're all playing into Sigma's hands.

736
01:15:38,965 --> 01:15:40,591
Damn it.

737
01:15:40,675 --> 01:15:42,636
Hey, drop your gun.

738
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:47,474
-What are you doing?
-Drop it!

739
01:15:48,267 --> 01:15:51,771
If that prick dies,
I'll never see my family again.

740
01:15:51,855 --> 01:15:52,981
Shut up.

741
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:54,107
Stop!

742
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,358
You stop!

743
01:15:56,694 --> 01:15:59,905
Do you really think
he will spare your brother?

744
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:04,119
He killed my dad.

745
01:16:07,706 --> 01:16:09,416
See? What did I tell you?

746
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:12,295
In just a few days,

747
01:16:13,337 --> 01:16:16,174
a war will break out
and kill 50 million people,

748
01:16:16,257 --> 01:16:19,094
yet everyone only cares
about their own families.

749
01:16:20,554 --> 01:16:23,724
This is why there can never be
a fair society in this country.

750
01:16:24,725 --> 01:16:27,062
-Right?
-Yes, totally.

751
01:16:27,145 --> 01:16:28,772
You're absolutely right, sir.

752
01:16:50,254 --> 01:16:52,924
Seo-hae, listen to me.

753
01:16:54,008 --> 01:16:55,259
Please.

754
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,055
Not today.

755
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:00,891
Please,

756
01:17:01,809 --> 01:17:03,018
Seo-hae.

757
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:09,901
Please.

758
01:17:21,373 --> 01:17:22,624
Was it today?

759
01:17:28,965 --> 01:17:30,133
Please, Seo-hae.

760
01:18:12,264 --> 01:18:14,099
Seo-hae, where are you right now?

761
01:18:14,683 --> 01:18:16,894
I didn't do anything.

762
01:18:16,977 --> 01:18:18,478
She left of her own accord.

763
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:23,359
I remember now.

764
01:18:24,152 --> 01:18:25,862
Let go of me, will you?

765
01:18:25,945 --> 01:18:29,074
Seo-hae's going to die
because of Han Tae-sul.

766
01:18:29,742 --> 01:18:31,243
You'll die if you go alone.

767
01:18:31,327 --> 01:18:34,331
Everything that happens from now on
will be as I planned.

768
01:18:35,165 --> 01:18:37,375
Why don't you try fighting that?
You bastard.

769
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:41,297
-Don't go. Please.
-I'm sorry, Seo-hae.
