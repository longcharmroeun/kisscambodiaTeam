00:00:57,082 --> 00:01:02,087
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,724
Hey, wake up.

3
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,229
She's not breathing. Hey!

4
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,532
One, two, three, four, five…

5
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,704
Hey, breathe!

6
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,832
Come on, breathe!

7
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,381
You're alive. Thank goodness!

8
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,263
Gosh.

9
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:23,780
SISYPHUS

10
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,774
I feel like I'm going to pass out.

11
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,569
Darn it.

12
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,408
I hope this works.

13
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,411
ACCESS

14
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,746
-<i>Security has been disabled.</i>
-Nice!

15
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,873
It worked!

16
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,958
Thank you, Seo-jin!

17
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,837
Don't move.

18
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,256
Damn it.

19
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,680
My back. Gosh, I feel like I'm dying.

20
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,018
Hold on.

21
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,150
You must be cold. Here.

22
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,655
She had a wound somewhere here.

23
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,825
Gosh.

24
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,579
It has to be disinfected.

25
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,997
Hold on.

26
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,794
Darn it.

27
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,676
Where is it?

28
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,680
Here it is. I found it.

29
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,099
Where is it?

30
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,160
Sorry.

31
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,960
Oh, hey. I'm sorry.

32
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,717
Hey, don't!

33
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,930
Isn't she the one who kidnapped you?

34
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,808
Seo-jin, I'll explain everything.

35
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,354
Hey, hold on.

36
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,566
It's very complicated,
and you'll find it hard to believe.

37
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,612
How should I put this?
It defies the laws of physics.

38
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,657
It's about the universe we live in.
Can you give me a moment?

39
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,954
Wait. Before that,
can you treat her first?

40
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,123
Or you can write her a prescription.

41
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,749
Who is that woman?

42
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,127
Isn't she the one who kidnapped you?

43
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,712
-No.
-Then who is she?

44
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,755
It's complicated.

45
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,299
Does Eddy know you're alive?

46
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,593
-Not yet.
-Then why are you here?

47
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,389
-Well, let's treat her first.
-Take her to the hospital.

48
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,892
She's a foreigner,
so she doesn't have health insurance.

49
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,811
Just write out a prescription

50
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,355
under your name or my name,
and we'll leave right away.

51
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,566
Darn it, you jerk!

52
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,819
I thought you were dead.

53
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,821
Gosh.

54
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,282
Darn it.

55
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,784
Why are you crying?

56
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,246
Hey.

57
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,458
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,002
I thought I was going to die too.

59
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,338
I'm sorry, Seo-jin. Okay?

60
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,174
Don't cry.

61
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,551
Go away.

62
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,981
You're all crazy.

63
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,617
Who in the world is she?

64
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,952
It's a long story.

65
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,704
I don't know either.

66
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,633
Is it serious?

67
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,635
Is she badly hurt?

68
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,223
She fell into a river earlier.
Did water get in her lungs?

69
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,816
What is it? Cardiac arrest?

70
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,070
She's malnourished.

71
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,337
Do you expect me to believe that?

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,885
It's the most ridiculous and absurd thing
you've ever done.

73
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,805
Hey, I fixed a falling airplane
and came back alive.

74
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,306
Doesn't that sound more absurd?

75
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,810
-Compared to that…
-You said she's from the future.

76
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,938
And you'll supposedly end up
building a time machine later on?

77
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,774
-An uploader.
-It's still a time machine.

78
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,820
And that's why those lunatics
are trying to kill you?

79
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,779
Sigma.

80
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,948
"Sigma"?

81
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,867
Is that someone's name?

82
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,245
I have no idea whether it's a person,
an organization, or an alien.

83
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:35,872
I see.

84
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,331
Hey.

85
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,543
Don't tell anyone about this.
If you do, they'll think you're crazy.

86
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,671
At least you know that.

87
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,133
Tae-sul, I've been telling you
to stop taking the pills

88
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,385
and get therapy, but I take it back.

89
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,971
You need to be hospitalized.

90
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,433
Honestly, I didn't know
your condition was this serious.

91
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,018
I was not seeing things.

92
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,270
I swear it was Tae-san. I saw him.

93
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,230
Do you realize that you're in danger?

94
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,025
When are you going to call Eddy?

95
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,403
Everyone's waiting for you now.

96
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,739
Is it because of her?

97
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,409
She saved my life.
I want to get her treated first.

98
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,702
From the Control Bureau?

99
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,787
-Yes.
-You're crazy.

100
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,705
Hey.

101
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,250
They're literally everywhere.

102
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,379
It must be a government organization.

103
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,173
They even tap our phones.

104
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,384
If I go out there rashly, I'll be screwed.

105
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,930
-Tae-sul.
-I should start getting prepared.

106
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,766
I'll figure out where Tae-san is
and how to deal with those--

107
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,017
Han Tae-sul!

108
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,312
Do you know who you sound like right now?

109
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,023
You sound just like your brother.

110
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,485
Hey, maybe Tae-san was right.

111
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,362
You saw this earlier.

112
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,738
It was a real gun.

113
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,950
And what about Bong-seon?
Are you saying it's all in my head?

114
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,496
Forget it.

115
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,625
I don't want to make the bed
for you and your new girlfriend.

116
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,212
I'm going home.
You'd better leave by tomorrow morning.

117
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,047
-And--
-Hey, Seo-jin.

118
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,387
Can you lend me your credit card?

119
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,347
I lost my wallet.

120
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,947
I'm going to report her
to the police tomorrow morning.

121
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,534
Hey, wait! Seo-jin.

122
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,746
Darn it.

123
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,459
Thanks. What a loyal friend.
She's a keeper.

124
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,687
I paid 150 million won for this? Jeez.

125
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,318
Don't I have the right
to take a look at what she wrote?

126
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,337
Forget it. I don't want to be so sneaky.

127
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,714
Mom.

128
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,145
Mom.

129
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,934
Where am I?

130
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,895
I don't want to tell you.
How are you feeling?

131
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,785
-My backpack.
-Just stay there.

132
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,666
But all the things that were inside…

133
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,753
Still… Here.

134
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,630
I managed to salvage these.

135
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,597
What's with that glare?
The diary? I didn't read it.

136
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,934
I said I didn't read it.

137
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,686
I should've just read it.

138
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,062
Then I will kill you.

139
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,070
Hey, here.

140
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,834
Get changed. Let's grab a bite.

141
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,430
Good. Help yourself.

142
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,932
You can eat everything here. Eat this too.

143
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:52,021
This too. You need to eat well, okay?

144
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,357
Hey, dip it in the sauce.

145
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,109
That's it.

146
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,698
These are all high in calories.
Who picked these?

147
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,658
Also,

148
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,746
take these to supplement
the nutrients that you may lack.

149
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,084
Yes, drink it. Go ahead and open it.

150
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:17,171
Not now? Drink your Coke, then.

151
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,720
By the way, is there not enough food
in the future?

152
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,016
I just can't wrap my head around it.

153
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:33,020
Why were all the people who crossed over
exposed to radiation?

154
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,023
Does the exposure happen
on their way here?

155
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,193
And let's go back
to what you brought up yesterday.

156
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,570
You said you won't let me
make the uploader.

157
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,614
Does it have something to do with it?

158
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,038
There will be a war.

159
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,000
No way. A nuclear war?

160
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,463
Yes, it starts in Wolsong.

161
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,299
That nuclear power plant will be nuked.

162
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,635
By North Korea?

163
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,765
And then,

164
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,643
Seoul will also be nuked.

165
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,690
Everyone will die.

166
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,194
<i>Everyone you and I know.</i>

167
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,905
<i>All the passersby you see now.</i>

168
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,908
But like I said,

169
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,745
I'll protect you.
I was told that it'll prevent the war.

170
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,622
Who told you that?

171
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,510
-What about them?
-The Control Bureau?

172
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,970
No idea. They didn't chase us.

173
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,347
They must be looking for us
with their eyes peeled.

174
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,392
-Are you going to go to that address?
-Yes.

175
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,438
Both the Control Bureau
and Sigma will be there.

176
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,943
Let's go.

177
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,339
<i>Please remove your cash.</i>

178
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,762
All right, let me sum it up.

179
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,849
I'm going to invent the uploader,
a machine that enables time travel.

180
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,560
So all sorts of people
will try to kill me.

181
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,729
That includes the Control Bureau.

182
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,066
And those jerks at Asia Mart
must be mad at me as well.

183
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,318
-And Sigma.
-Yes, Sigma.

184
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,154
But what are they?
An individual or an organization?

185
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,409
Anyway, all sorts of mysterious people
will try to kill me from now on.

186
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,120
You're in danger too. Right?

187
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,832
Then let's go our separate ways.

188
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,045
I've been meaning to say this.
Thank you so much. I mean it.

189
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,214
In Busan and at the Han River yesterday…

190
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,633
If it weren't for you,
I'd already be dead.

191
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,886
But you have no reason
to do all this for me.

192
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,388
You nearly died too.

193
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,307
And I'm not a nice person. You know that.

194
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,771
So with that said,
I'll figure things out on my own now.

195
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,483
Take this.

196
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,571
Come on, take it.
You'll need it to get by.

197
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,033
Find a place to live and look for a job.

198
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,202
Just live your life and be happy.

199
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,122
Only five percent of those
who come here survive.

200
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,500
You risked a lot to come here,
so I don't want to ruin this opportunity.

201
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,918
But I have to protect you.

202
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,628
Yes, I know, to prevent the war.

203
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,964
Does that mean
the war will break out if I die?

204
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,258
That's…

205
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,302
Uploaders, downloaders, war, Sigma…

206
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,347
I can't fully trust you
and will not trust everything you say.

207
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,184
And it'll be a nuisance
for me to have a bodyguard.

208
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,103
You won't even last a day on your own.

209
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,856
-Sigma--
-Okay, who told you that?

210
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,069
My diary.

211
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,990
It said you'll save the world
if I save you.

212
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,288
At PEXCO,

213
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,333
I could've met my brother
had you not dragged me out of there.

214
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,336
No, you would've died,
which would lead to the war.

215
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,380
That's your problem.

216
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,050
Let me ask you something.

217
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,887
Let's say I found my brother again,
but the situation is dangerous.

218
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,724
Then will you stop me again?
Because there will be war if I die?

219
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,351
Yes.

220
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,861
You're unbelievable.

221
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,198
You'll just do what you need to do
even if everyone will die?

222
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,825
You selfish jerk.

223
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,092
Let me help you, please.

224
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,510
I'll do it alone.

225
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,553
You want me to just go back?

226
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,391
You're the only person I know
whether from the past, present, or future.

227
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,270
Do you know what it's like to be alone?

228
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,942
You can't do it on your own.

229
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,570
No, thanks. I prefer working alone.

230
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,794
There's plenty of cash in the future.

231
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,004
We need it for lighting fires.

232
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,529
Hey!

233
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,906
Damn it.

234
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,117
You psychos! Let me out!

235
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,827
Hello,

236
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,163
<i>I'm a police officer
of the Republic of Korea!</i>

237
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,122
<i>Kidnapping a cop?</i>

238
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,207
Have you lost your mind?

239
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,547
Let me call my family at least.
Just one phone call!

240
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,966
My mom is waiting for me!

241
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,051
I have to go see my mom!

242
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,053
Hey! Are you listening?

243
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,848
<i>Let me out at once!</i>

244
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,225
<i>Hey!</i>

245
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,769
-Is he the one?
-<i>Damn it!</i>

246
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,937
Yes.

247
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,148
And he happens to be a cop.

248
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,901
Things got complicated.

249
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,904
I know. What should we do?

250
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,281
Follow protocol?

251
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,451
What did the doctor say?

252
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,663
Even after I remove the cast,

253
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,707
I'll need rehabilitation therapy
for a year.

254
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,089
<i>Darn it.</i>

255
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,718
<i>This is nuts!</i>

256
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,934
THE END IS NEAR

257
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,353
"The end"?

258
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,396
Where am I?

259
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,983
The Control Bureau.
It's sort of like the Immigration Office.

260
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,527
The Control Bureau?

261
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,321
Well, what do you "control"?

262
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,656
Illegal entrants.

263
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,908
Look.

264
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,160
The guy you caught the other day
is one of them.

265
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,666
Where are these people from?

266
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,043
That's not important.

267
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,671
What matters is "when."

268
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,766
<i>Back in the old days,</i>

269
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,439
<i>people knew everything
about their neighbors.</i>

270
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,442
<i>They even knew how many spoons
their neighbors had.</i>

271
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,572
<i>So if there was a newcomer,
you'd notice right away.</i>

272
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,577
<i>But these days, people don't even know
who lives next door to them.</i>

273
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,621
<i>They don't even care.
That's the world we live in now.</i>

274
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,459
<i>But we aren't the only ones in this world.</i>

275
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,257
<i>The uninvited are living among us.</i>

276
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,894
You got promoted early.

277
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,733
-A special recruit?
-Yes, for gunnery.

278
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,910
In 2021, the uploader was invented.

279
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,453
It's a time machine.

280
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:56,416
We catch people who travel to the present
from the future through the uploader.

281
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,465
LIST OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
UNDER EXAMINATION

282
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,637
SUCCESSFULLY INVESTED IN STOCKS

283
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,806
REALIZED MASSIVE REAL ESTATE PROFITS
ELIMINATED

284
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,478
A time machine?
Then what about the lottery?

285
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,979
They'd all win the lottery.

286
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,024
Right, everyone is curious about that.

287
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,694
Upon encountering
the very first illegal entrant in 2002,

288
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,030
the government established
the Control Bureau.

289
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,532
What did they do first?

290
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,826
Here.

291
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,453
The lottery.

292
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,789
LOTTERY COMMISSION
2020 REPORT

293
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,458
They founded the Lottery Commission

294
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,962
to take care of all the expenses
for catching the illegal entrants.

295
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,678
Okay. So what?

296
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,849
So what do you want me to do?

297
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,852
You don't have to believe me.
I don't expect you to anyway.

298
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,773
I'm sorry to say this,

299
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,359
but while you were here,

300
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,362
your mother passed away.

301
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,660
What?

302
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,000
Hyeon-gi.

303
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:25,130
Mom!

304
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,641
Where have you been?

305
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,393
Mom.

306
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,899
Mom!

307
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,701
Mom!

308
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,961
That woman is the prime suspect.
She's an illegal entrant.

309
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,797
She broke into your house,

310
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,966
stole your gun and car, and ran away.

311
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,844
She shot and killed your mother,

312
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,763
who couldn't even fight back.

313
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,311
By the time we arrived at the scene,

314
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,314
the suspect had already fled.

315
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:38,203
You see, they all say the same thing
at the beginning.

316
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,665
That they came here
because they missed the clean air,

317
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,085
they missed their late parents, and so on.

318
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,338
They also say
that they'll stay out of trouble.

319
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:52,133
But once they get here,

320
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,844
they get greedy.

321
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,265
Have you ever thought about
how strange it is?

322
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,270
Some people keep making a fortune
in the stock market or real estate.

323
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,522
So why does nothing in life work out

324
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,692
for ordinary people like us?

325
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,238
Some people act as though
they can foresee the future,

326
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,699
so why are ordinary people like us

327
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,118
struggling to just make ends meet?

328
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:24,165
We no longer have the opportunity
to become successful

329
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,626
by pure chance and luck.

330
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,841
Do you want to fix it?

331
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:16,843
Tae-san!

332
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,678
Tae-san!

333
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,288
What's going on?

334
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,500
Damn it.

335
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,049
<i>They all look dumb.</i>

336
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:39,801
<i>What do you mean?</i>

337
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,596
<i>They're smiling,
not knowing they'll all die soon.</i>

338
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,734
-No!
-it's dangerous!

339
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,153
-What's she doing?
-My gosh!

340
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,365
Hey! What are you doing?

341
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,243
-Are you crazy? Move!
-Out of the way!

342
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,078
-Move!
-You're blocking the road!

343
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,372
-Get out of there!
-Hey!

344
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,334
-Hey, move!
-Have you lost your mind?

345
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,098
What is she doing over there?

346
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:10,850
The red light is on.

347
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,317
I certainly know
what it's like to be alone.

348
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,822
I've been feeling so alone
ever since my brother died.

349
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,699
He said the same thing.

350
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,702
"Don't worry about money.
Study as much as you like,

351
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,830
do everything you want to do,
and be happy."

352
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,874
He was always covered in oil,

353
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,043
working himself to the bone
at an auto shop,

354
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,629
but he just wanted me to be happy.

355
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,923
Then he suddenly died.

356
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,719
I must find my brother.

357
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,722
So no matter
how dangerous the situation is,

358
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,724
don't drag me out like you did last time

359
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,519
when my brother is right in front of me.

360
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,145
Can you do that?

361
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,023
If your answer is yes,

362
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,279
I want you to protect me from them

363
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,447
and save the world.

364
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,620
Okay.

365
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,831
We're different from the police.

366
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,833
You may shoot and kill
any illegal entrant.

367
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,381
Don't breathe in the air. It's toxic.

368
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,467
I took it off for a second to tie my hair.

369
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,887
-What about you, Dad?
-I'm fine.

370
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,536
Nice! Incredible!

371
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,002
My gosh, they're so handsome.

372
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,299
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH HAN TAE-SUL,
CEO OF QUANTUM & TIME

373
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,471
"Young Asian Tycoon,

374
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:02,183
New Paradigm of Quantum Transmission."
Whatever.

375
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,732
Nice!

376
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,569
Look what I've got!

377
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,116
Oh, no.

378
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,125
I'll take them all with me.

379
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,009
I don't see any fruit cocktail.

380
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,263
What you see is all there is,
so just grab everything.

381
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,836
Let's have some fun!

382
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,047
Hit the target and score ten points!

383
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,824
How dare you come into our turf?

384
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:09,161
Ready or not, here we come.
We'll kill you!

385
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,167
Darn it!

386
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,837
Hey, will I win against you
if I catch them both today?

387
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,090
No, it'll be a tie.
The current score is 149 to 147.

388
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,842
So I'll be beating you!

389
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,719
Are you an idiot?

390
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,062
Darn it, those rotten little punks.

391
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,272
Gang Seo-hae!

392
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:54,165
Damn it! What the hell?

393
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,542
Hey! Everyone follow me!

394
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,211
Looks like I'll win today.

395
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,560
How many are there?

396
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,771
About nine or ten?

397
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,397
Darn it.

398
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,027
Let's just leave the things here.

399
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,196
More of them will come
because of the gunshots.

400
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,502
-Behind the post.
-Behind the post?

401
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,796
I see.

402
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,631
Hey, you two!

403
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,884
If you wrecked our turf,
you should pay for it.

404
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,552
Come out at once!

405
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,180
You come here, you punk!

406
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,142
What a lunatic.

407
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,302
Damn it! Boss, they're not here!

408
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,471
Where are they hiding?

409
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,481
By the tool board.

410
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,456
Darn it.

411
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,459
Hey, tell the rest of our guys
to come here!

412
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,298
Here.

413
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,926
I grabbed it earlier.

414
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,677
Yes! Nice!

415
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,350
-Did you get hurt?
-No.

416
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,668
Dad!

417
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,392
Catch that girl first!

418
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,074
Please don't kill me.

419
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,622
How old are you?

420
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,333
I'm 18.

421
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,385
Why didn't you shoot him?

422
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,929
He was going to shoot you--

423
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,848
-Because he'll die anyway.
-Gang Seo-hae!

424
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,605
Once you get soft,
you'll lose something even more precious.

425
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,239
Dad.

426
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,618
I'm fine. I was just grazed by the bullet.

427
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,499
Let's go.

428
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,186
Dad, are you okay?

429
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,105
Of course.

430
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,862
By the way, what is this place?

431
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,698
A sauna?

432
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,536
What did people do here?

433
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,706
People used to come here
for sauna bathing.

434
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,917
What is that?

435
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:59,173
Oh, it's like a room
where people relax in dry heat,

436
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:03,594
take baths, or lie down and watch TV.

437
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,475
So this place used to be warm.

438
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,865
-Dad.
-Yes?

439
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,577
Which one tastes the best?

440
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,207
<i>Jjajangmyeon</i>, of course.

441
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,834
It was your favorite when you were little.

442
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,670
I don't remember.

443
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,382
Which one do you want to eat the most?

444
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,719
<i>TTUKBAEGI</i> BULGOGI

445
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,387
<i>Ttukbaegi</i> bulgogi.

446
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,765
What's that?

447
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,853
Soupy bulgogi

448
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,189
cooked in a <i>ttukbaegi</i>.

449
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,899
What is a <i>ttukbaegi</i>?

450
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,736
It's an earthenware pot
used for making stew.

451
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,988
And bulgogi?

452
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,365
Bulgogi is

453
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,451
sliced beef
marinated in soy sauce, then boiled.

454
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,913
-Is it good?
-Yes, it's delicious.

455
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,167
Your mom made delicious bulgogi.

456
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,505
Seo-hae, which one
do you want to eat the most?

457
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,341
<i>Tteokbokki.</i>

458
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,011
Mom made it for me as a snack
whenever I had a short school day.

459
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,180
It was so good.

460
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,566
Dad.

461
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,234
Yes?

462
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,741
What would you do
if you could go back in time?

463
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,836
SAUNA

464
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,921
Darn it.

465
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,684
There's so much water here.
It tastes good too.

466
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,269
We were always short of water.

467
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,854
The water tastes good?

468
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,106
Yes, it did.

469
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,611
You drank the bathwater?

470
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,863
Yes. Why?

471
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,617
Nothing. Well done.

472
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,706
Damn, this place is packed with people.
Did we really have to come here?

473
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,541
It's safer here.

474
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,711
They can't shoot us here,
and it's easier to spot suspicious people.

475
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,631
Right. The water tastes good too.

476
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,052
It's really warm here.

477
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,889
Obviously! We're in the sauna.
Did you expect it to be cold?

478
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,766
I didn't know.

479
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,560
You have a lot to learn.

480
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,650
CAFETERIA

481
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,236
What? Are you hungry?

482
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,034
I want…

483
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,996
The special <i>tonkatsu</i>. I'll get that.

484
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,247
Pick what you want.

485
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:20,832
I'll get…

486
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,626
<i>TTUKBAEGI</i> BULGOGI

487
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,503
<i>Ttukbaegi</i> bulgogi.

488
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:47,776
What's wrong?

489
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,321
It's good.

490
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,123
What's this?

491
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,250
You'll tag along everywhere I go,

492
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,334
so you'll need it.

493
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,420
SEO-HAE

494
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,137
Good. That's my number. Save it.

495
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,354
Hand it over. Goodness.

496
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,691
Are there no cell phones in the future?

497
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,192
HAN TAE-SUL

498
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,194
"Tae-sul."

499
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,698
Don't answer calls from anyone else.

500
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,533
I don't even know anyone else.

501
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,960
Your diary got all wet and crumpled.

502
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,296
I bought a similar one for you.

503
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,264
So it was from you.

504
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,275
-By the way…
-What?

505
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,943
You said when your brother came,

506
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,780
he brought the suitcase
and a key Mr. Park is after.

507
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,656
Yes, the key to the safe.

508
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,284
What's in the safe?

509
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,871
Some research documents.

510
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,500
About topological changes of space-time
and the inflection points…

511
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,003
What is that?

512
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,380
Hey.

513
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,967
Maybe that's the uploader.

514
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,264
Speaking of which,

515
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,184
let's go to my place after we finish this.

516
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,438
We need to figure out what to wear
when we sneak into the chairman's party.

517
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,817
Besides, that key is at my place.

518
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,443
Hey!

519
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,657
Darn it.

520
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,369
Are you kidding me?
You left that important thing at home?

521
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,246
I didn't know it was important,

522
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,289
and I thought
my house would be the safest.

523
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,250
I hid it well.

524
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,989
-Where's the key?
-It's in my lab.

525
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,833
Did someone already ransack your place?

526
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,002
It always looks like this.

527
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,796
It looks messy,
but I'd say it's an orderly mess.

528
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,673
-Where did you put it?
-In a drawer.

529
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,300
Hey! You said you hid it well.

530
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,224
Jeez, look.

531
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,319
Watch.

532
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,699
Are we good now?

533
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,326
Hey,

534
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,871
the party is tomorrow evening,
so let's get some rest today.

535
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,290
-Wait.
-What is it?

536
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,312
What happened?

537
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,940
The alarm system was turned off
for a moment.

538
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,816
-Was there no power outage?
-No.

539
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,026
Take a look around.

540
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,601
Don't stand so close to me.

541
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,061
Be quiet.

542
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,395
Yes, sir.

543
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,106
I stopped by Tae-sul's place for a moment.

544
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,776
No, it's nothing serious.

545
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,071
The alarm system shut down for a moment,
but it's back up now.

546
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,992
Yes, we're checking it now.
I don't think it's anything serious.

547
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,078
The thing is,

548
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,749
the police said
they'll stop searching for him now.

549
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,793
They search for missing persons
for up to two weeks.

550
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,754
Yes, sir.

551
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,090
I'm going to just let it go.

552
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,677
Yes.

553
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,889
Okay, I will.

554
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,565
All clear, sir.

555
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:03,860
Have a few guys stand guard here
until tomorrow morning just in case.

556
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,868
Is this the police?

557
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,955
Yes, last night…

558
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,792
<i>They're literally everywhere.</i>

559
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,628
<i>It must be a government organization.</i>

560
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,296
<i>They even tap our phones.</i>

561
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,257
<i>Go ahead.</i>

562
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,094
No, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

563
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,519
HAN TAE-SAN

564
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,480
PSYCHIATRIST KIM SEO-JIN

565
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,112
<i>Do you still see things these days?</i>

566
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,865
<i>They're not hallucinations.</i>

567
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,453
<i>I'm serious. Those people…</i>

568
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,874
They live among us in hiding.

569
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,088
Those jerks will kill Tae-sul.

570
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:49,883
Who are "they"?

571
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,094
Sigma.

572
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,769
HAN TAE-SAN

573
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,034
<i>You idiots! Are you kidding me?</i>

574
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,914
Find them and bring them here, okay?

575
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,333
Go find them at once.

576
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,086
They're gone.

577
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,004
Darn it.

578
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,715
-Have you checked his place?
-We did.

579
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,009
But we couldn't go in
because of tight security.

580
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,971
Find them no matter what

581
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:41,851
and bring them right here. Okay?

582
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:43,937
Okay?

583
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:49,442
Jeez, I shall rip these rats to pieces.

584
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,364
Find them, okay?

585
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,829
Go find them yourself if it's that urgent.

586
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,456
That's why I'm heading out now!

587
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,027
Darn it.

588
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,780
Is there a back door?

589
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,366
There is a secret door I built
to avoid paparazzi,

590
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,369
but they're guarding
in front of that door as well.

591
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,288
-"Paparazzi"?
-Yes.

592
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,873
Tabloid reporters.

593
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,959
It was because of a girl I briefly dated.

594
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,839
What? Is that important now?

595
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,095
-Let's just wait.
-Until when?

596
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,972
Until tomorrow morning.

597
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,391
They'll go on patrol at 9 a.m.,
so we'll leave then.

598
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,435
I know where all the security cameras are.

599
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,024
Don't stand so close to the window.

600
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,444
But you've been standing here
this whole time.

601
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:27,684
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

602
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,437
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

603
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,900
<i>-Happy birthday, Dear Seo-hae
-Happy birthday, Dear Seo-hae</i>

604
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,028
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

605
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,038
-A cell phone?
-Do you like it?

606
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,708
Yes! It's awesome.

607
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,126
Save my number.

608
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,795
Call me if anything happens, okay?

609
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:56,879
Okay.

610
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,651
You told me not to stand by the window.

611
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,654
The moon has risen,
so they can't see us from outside.

612
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:08,743
I got nothing to drink except for this.
Do you want one?

613
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,053
What? Is there no booze in the future?

614
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,389
There is,
but my dad never let me have any.

615
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,976
Oh, dear. Your dad is way too strict.

616
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,732
Go on.

617
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,783
Look. That's the N Seoul Tower.

618
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,161
So that's what it looked like originally.

619
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,997
What does it look like in the future?

620
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,667
It's collapsed to the side.

621
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,963
How serious is this war?

622
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,675
The future is

623
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,971
very different from now. There's nothing.

624
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,434
Have you contacted your family?

625
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,230
-No.
-Why not?

626
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,024
Because I can't.

627
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:25,194
Because of the Control Bureau?
Will it endanger them?

628
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:36,956
That's my brother.

629
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,837
See that area over there?

630
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,298
The shantytown on the hill.

631
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,301
We used to live there.

632
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,429
My brother and I lived
in a semi-basement room there

633
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,639
until I graduated from middle school.

634
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,601
His job was…

635
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:00,938
While working as a mechanic,
he learned how to repair trains.

636
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,857
Do you know what a train is?

637
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,985
He worked for a train maintenance company.

638
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:10,239
Every time I called him,
he'd be at a different train station.

639
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,371
Maybe that's why he's so good at hiding.

640
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,420
Let's talk about something else.

641
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,715
Are there any places
you've wanted to go to?

642
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,800
Places I've wanted to go to?

643
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:36,265
An amusement park? Why?

644
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,600
To ride the pirate ship.

645
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,561
You don't know how to have fun.

646
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,730
I don't know what it's like in the future,

647
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,942
but Yeonnam-dong is
the most up-and-coming area at the moment.

648
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:49,487
There are many good restaurants and bars.

649
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,448
-No.
-Why not?

650
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,742
-Then go to a water park.
-Where?

651
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,035
It's a swimming pool.

652
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,914
-I don't like swimming pools.
-Why not?

653
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:02,041
You see good-looking men and women

654
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,502
checking each other out and chatting away.

655
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,922
Then they'll go eat churros together.

656
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:09,924
I'll go to an amusement park.

657
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,259
To ride the pirate ship?

658
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:18,975
I went to an amusement park
with my mom on my ninth birthday,

659
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,559
but I was too short to ride it.

660
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,478
Only by two centimeters.

661
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:27,525
I promised my mom I'd grow taller
so I could ride it the year after,

662
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,194
but the war broke out.

663
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,867
But the pirate ship is no big deal.

664
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,745
Whenever I think about it,

665
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,957
it brings back
these bad memories that I have.

666
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,628
Was it during the holidays?

667
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:51,799
My brother and I picked up
this high-paying part-time gig there.

668
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:56,053
Our job was to check the equipment
and clean the site.

669
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,973
I was waiting under the ride
while it was in operation

670
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:03,686
when vomit suddenly fell from the sky.

671
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:05,813
That smell.

672
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,441
No matter how many times
I washed my clothes…

673
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,108
THE LATE KIM JEONG-HYE

674
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:56,382
THE LATE KIM JEONG-HYE

675
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:04,348
I'm sorry for your loss.

676
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:12,982
It's okay.

677
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,734
Just put it to good use.

678
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,659
I'm sorry you had to forgo her funeral.

679
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,037
No one would come anyway.

680
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:30,499
-I've reported you missing.
-Okay.

681
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,713
We're family now.

682
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,051
We received a report overnight.

683
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:48,475
<i>Here, you see the trails of
illegal entrant 250811 and Han Tae-sul.</i>

684
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:52,271
After contacting the illegal entrant,
Han evaded our pursuit,

685
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,648
then met her again in Busan

686
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,901
and fled with her help.

687
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:59,403
After that, they disappeared
for about three days.

688
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:04,074
Then they broke into a home in Imun-dong,
killed an innocent civilian,

689
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,869
stole some money and a car, and ran away.

690
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:11,665
That was six days ago,
and their trail has gone cold.

691
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,667
<i>The report is</i>

692
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:17,880
a reconstruction of statements
made by several illegal entrants.

693
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:22,760
We know where Han Tae-sul
and the suspect are headed.

694
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,554
I know you're still in mourning
and in training,

695
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,057
but if you want to join this operation,
I'll let you--

696
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,475
Yes, I want to.

697
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:35,648
Okay.

698
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,014
<i>I just have to go inside?</i>

699
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,309
<i>We're just going to find out
where my brother is.</i>

700
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,937
<i>Shoot the woman dead on sight.</i>

701
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,899
You were all in it together?

702
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,360
Goodbye.

703
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:48,322
<i>Where's Seo-hae?</i>

704
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,115
It's a typical delusion.

705
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,910
You knew about people
coming from the future!

706
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:54,244
Please stop!

707
01:12:58,791 --> 01:12:59,625
Seo-hae.
