00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:10,070
19 YEARS AGO
AUGUST 6, 2001

2
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,074
Hello?

3
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,076
Are you still alive?

4
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,495
I thought you were dead.
Why weren't you picking up?

5
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,622
What time is it?

6
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,999
It's past nine. Almost ten o'clock.

7
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,084
What?

8
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,878
I asked you to wake me at eight!

9
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,256
I kept calling you,
but you wouldn't pick up.

10
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,926
I told you I have to get the results
before meeting the investors tomorrow!

11
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,761
You couldn't do me that one favor?

12
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,305
Hey. I work so hard
enduring the smell of oil

13
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,267
just to support you.
How can you talk like that to me?

14
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,687
Anyway, I'm almost done.
I'll be home at around 12.

15
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,063
How about some beer later?

16
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,107
Sounds nice.

17
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,984
Oh, can you pick up

18
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,987
a box of Bacchus energy drinks
on your way home?

19
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,823
Don't get the fake ones
just because they're cheaper.

20
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,241
Only Bacchus, okay?

21
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,827
All right. I get it.

22
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,550
Jeez. I'm screwed.

23
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,851
So how is it going?

24
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,618
Wow.

25
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,163
Is it going to work this time?

26
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,749
Come on. Work.

27
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,426
No! What the heck?

28
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,192
Darn it.

29
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,944
I messed up.

30
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,875
-What?
-What's going on?

31
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,169
What's happening?

32
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,012
Gosh! Isn't that a man?

33
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,305
-Where?
-Oh, my gosh!

34
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,641
Sir, there's someone
on the rails over there!

35
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,811
-Move away from the rails!
-Is he dead?

36
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,522
Stay back, everyone!

37
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,774
-What's he doing?
-What's going on?

38
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,155
Sir, it's dangerous to be here.

39
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,993
The train is going to come soon.

40
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,079
Sir? Hello?

41
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,956
What?

42
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,500
Is he drunk?

43
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,755
Hey! Get up. Are you okay?

44
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,299
You shouldn't be…

45
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,638
What's this?

46
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,768
What? Why does he have
a photo of Tae-sul and me?

47
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,315
RECORDS OF ATTACKS ON HAN TAE-SUL

48
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,358
JULY 15, 2020: PLANE CRASH
AUGUST 15, 2020: CONFERENCE SHOOTING

49
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,950
Hey. What is this?
What does this all mean?

50
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,619
Who are you? How do you know Tae-sul?

51
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,079
Who are you?

52
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,914
What?

53
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,431
Hey, wait!

54
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,019
Hey, you! Who are you?

55
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:15,450
SISYPHUS

56
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,053
You're up.

57
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,684
You seem to have a lot of nightmares.
I do, too.

58
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,151
Let's go. Everyone's gone now.

59
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,820
Okay.

60
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:33,786
BANK TRANSFER FORM
THREE MILLION WON

61
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:46,174
"Kim Jin-hui."

62
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,267
RESIDENT ID CARD

63
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,315
RESIDENT ID CARD
PARK JAE-UK

64
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,609
-"Park Jae-uk."
-Sir!

65
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,153
You startled me!

66
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,072
What are you doing here?
What about the store?

67
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,408
It's payday today.
I came to get everyone's money.

68
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,620
Just use your phone for stuff like that.

69
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,205
Go back to the store.

70
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,500
Illegal immigrants can't use
mobile banking. That's too risky.

71
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,836
Anyway, who are you sending that to?

72
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,548
Three million won kept disappearing
from the account book. Is this it?

73
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,342
Just go, will you?

74
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,637
-Who are you sending it to?
-Hey!

75
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,849
Jeez. I work so many hours every day,

76
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,351
but I only get 1,8 million.

77
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,771
I provide you guys
with board and lodging as well.

78
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,149
Plus, you get additional incentives
for every successful deal.

79
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,027
Do your best.
Then I'll pay you three million won.

80
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,239
Just go and find Han Tae-sul!

81
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,412
Jeez. Aren't you going?
Do you want me to cut your pay?

82
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,916
What a horrible boss.

83
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,336
Fine. I am, so just report me
to the Ministry of Employment and Labor.

84
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,379
Sue me.

85
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,256
What will she do about it?

86
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,617
Stop staring at me.

87
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,246
You look fine. We're attending a party.

88
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,332
You look pretty.

89
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,460
Where should I hide my gun?

90
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,838
Don't even use that.

91
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,340
And let's not get shot, either.

92
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,383
Put that away.

93
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,931
Why aren't you dressed up?

94
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,809
I told you. Everyone will recognize me,
so I can't go in.

95
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,900
I just have to go inside?

96
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,071
Yes. I got your name on the list.

97
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,203
-What…
-Grace Park.

98
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,915
You have to pronounce it properly.

99
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,376
You're listed as
a foreign investment firm employee.

100
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,297
And if they ask questions,
pretend you don't understand Korean.

101
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,132
But I can't speak English.

102
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:37,053
It's fine. They'll get fooled
by anyone who's dressed up like this.

103
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,931
-I look stupid.
-No, you don't.

104
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,226
Besides, you have to hide
in the crowd of fools.

105
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,355
All right. I'm going through
the back door.

106
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,358
I'll look around the back
and the second floor, and you…

107
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,444
I'll check the first floor.
The entrance to the banquet hall.

108
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,488
Right. Okay.

109
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,034
Hold on. Let's check one last time.

110
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,413
We're just going to find out
where my brother is.

111
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,790
No commotion, okay?

112
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,833
No hitting people,

113
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,294
twisting their joints
or knocking them out.

114
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,923
You're dressed elegantly today,
so don't do that.

115
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,385
Whether it's Sigma or someone else,
don't fight with anyone.

116
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,595
-We'll see.
-Hey!

117
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,013
Fine.

118
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,022
Hang on.

119
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,300
Do you hear me?

120
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,221
Say something.

121
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,598
Stop it.

122
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,563
Here. This is an EMP.

123
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,024
If something happens,
push this red button.

124
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,819
Then it'll cause a blackout
in the whole building,

125
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,280
and we won't be able to communicate.
Got it?

126
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,957
Gang Seo-hae.

127
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,877
We got the approval.

128
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,547
Shoot the woman dead on sight.

129
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,589
To your positions!

130
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,949
Welcome. May I ask your name?

131
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,869
-Grace Park.
-One moment.

132
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,081
Okay. Welcome, Ms. Park.

133
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,668
Ms. Grace Park is entering.

134
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,721
I'm in.

135
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,806
<i>Is everything going okay?</i>

136
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,477
People keep staring at me.

137
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,022
<i>I told you not to draw their attention.</i>

138
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,026
I didn't do anything.

139
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,788
-<i>What about my brother?</i>
-I don't see him.

140
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,876
But what are all these people doing here?

141
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,047
Well, they're all celebrating
my death together.

142
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,091
But they're your company's people.

143
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,178
<i>Well, to be exact, it's a stock company.</i>

144
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,180
<i>I only have five percent of the stocks,</i>

145
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>so the remaining 95 percent</i>

146
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,393
<i>are having a party to celebrate my death.</i>

147
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,407
It hasn't been officially announced yet,

148
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,828
<i>but since this is a special occasion,
you can all greet him first.</i>

149
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,499
This is the new CEO of Quantum & Time,

150
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,334
Edward Kim.

151
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,503
Eddy, come and greet them.

152
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,389
Thank you.
It's nice to meet you, everyone.

153
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,684
You must have been worried and anxious

154
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,395
due to the unfortunate events
that happened to our company.

155
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,314
It's not official yet,
but as the next CEO,

156
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:27,194
I want to tell you something today.

157
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,323
From now on, Quantum & Time
will be a company

158
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,412
that is defined by the two words,
trust and stability.

159
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,250
I want to use this opportunity
to ask for your support and encouragement.

160
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,168
You're all so excited, aren't you?

161
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,307
Hey.

162
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,854
<i>After this is over,
let's go to an amusement park.</i>

163
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,230
<i>I'll be your guide.</i>

164
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,274
But you hate amusement parks.

165
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,984
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

166
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,278
Well, you said you wanted to go.

167
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,864
I can just wait in line there.

168
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,577
<i>So</i>

169
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,329
<i>be careful.</i>

170
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,374
You too.

171
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,559
Team A, clear.

172
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,270
Team B, clear.

173
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,609
Sniper Team, clear.

174
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,034
Starting communication jamming.

175
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,341
Excuse me.

176
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,346
We've met before, right?
You look familiar.

177
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,436
Did we

178
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,314
meet at a conference?

179
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,776
Atlanta? Sydney?

180
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,445
There's no way I'd forget
such a beauty like you.

181
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,864
No.

182
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,742
You really don't know me?

183
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,869
I don't.

184
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,082
Then I can be honest with you.

185
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,504
I did over a hundred handshakes
with all these people here.

186
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,967
Everyone here apparently came
to congratulate me,

187
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,094
but the problem is

188
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,347
I can't trust any one of them.

189
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,601
To these people here,

190
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:09,565
I'm just a playing card
they'll discard after one use.

191
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,775
Just like my friend.

192
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,112
Han Tae-sul.

193
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,823
You know him, right?

194
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,704
I must've lost my mind.

195
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,167
He was a jerk,
but he was a good jerk. Damn it.

196
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,715
You're the only one I don't know here,
so let's clink our glasses.

197
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,760
Tae-sul,

198
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,723
I'll meet you in hell.

199
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,483
Why are you here?

200
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,737
I came with a friend.

201
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,699
Which friend? I know everyone here.

202
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,243
Well…

203
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,336
We're just going to find out
where my brother is.

204
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,048
Excuse me.

205
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,345
Han Tae-sul. I found Han Tae-san.

206
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,196
Yes, I'm patrolling the second floor.

207
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,909
Yes, it's clear.

208
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,835
<i>Han Tae-sul. I found your brother.</i>

209
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,879
What? Seo-hae?

210
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,674
Seo-hae? Gang Seo-hae!

211
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,926
What?

212
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,012
What did you say? Seo-hae!

213
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,598
Darn it. What did she say?

214
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,737
What is this?

215
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,657
"Technology transfer agreement"?

216
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,076
QUANTUM TELEPORTATION TECHNOLOGY
TRANSFER AGREEMENT

217
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,580
QUANTUM & TIME WILL SHARE
TECHNOLOGY WITH SIGMA

218
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,249
"Sigma."

219
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,652
Han Tae-sul, answer me.
I found your brother.

220
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,240
Hey!

221
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,841
Get that woman!

222
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,510
Find her!

223
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,395
I know who you are. Listen to me.

224
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,606
Stay away from Tae-sul. Understand?

225
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,861
What? Tae-sul, what happened?

226
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,573
Mr. Kim. What the hell is this?

227
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,742
Who the hell is Sigma?

228
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,536
-Our investor.
-Since when?

229
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,456
What do you mean?
Since the beginning. I reported it to you.

230
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,753
CEO: HAN TAE-SUL

231
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,426
<i>The Control Bureau's operation
starts in a minute.</i>

232
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,893
You should've attended our meetings.

233
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,479
I told you so many times
to pay attention--

234
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,440
-I'm going to tell everyone.
-Tell them what?

235
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,402
A crazy guy named Sigma is trying
to kill you and take over the company?

236
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,031
Or that there's a time machine,
and people are coming from the future?

237
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,994
What? Did you think you were
the only one who knew?

238
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,454
What?

239
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,251
-You were all in it together?
-Who would believe you now?

240
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,088
I'm sorry, but please stay quiet.

241
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,257
-Or you'll end up like your brother--
-What?

242
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,719
He can easily send people
to the mental ward.

243
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,471
Don't bother trying.

244
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,266
The Control Bureau has you surrounded.
Everything's over.

245
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,394
I'll kill you! I'm going to…

246
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,013
I got Han Tae-sul.

247
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,516
The girl. Start the operation.

248
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,395
Gang Seo-hae,
daughter of Lieutenant Gang Dong-gi.

249
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,106
You're putting Tae-sul in danger.

250
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,861
This is my last warning.
If I ever see you again,

251
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,488
I'll kill you.

252
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,171
We found her.

253
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,008
It's the Control Bureau. Han Tae-sul.

254
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,302
Han Tae-sul!

255
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,852
Catch her!

256
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,064
-What's going on?
-Crazy wench!

257
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,865
-Hey!
-Hey!

258
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,243
-Hey!
-Get it open! Hurry!

259
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,746
Hey, where are you?

260
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,568
Han Tae-sul, you idiot. Answer me!

261
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,952
<i>This is an EMP.</i>

262
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,455
If something happens,
push this red button.

263
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,292
Then it'll cause a blackout
in the whole building,

264
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,043
and we won't be able to communicate.

265
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,547
Goodbye.

266
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,508
Let's not cause a commotion.
People are watching.

267
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,927
You have nowhere else to go, anyway.

268
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,322
<i>Don't go outside. There's a sniper.</i>

269
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,492
My first mission was to kill you.

270
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,464
Get in!

271
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,722
Put your guns down. Check the plate!

272
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,085
Aren't you glad to see me?
You remember me, right?

273
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,088
What are you doing here?

274
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,714
Aren't you glad to see me?

275
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,300
Turn the car. Han Tae-sul…

276
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,635
What? Is that blood?

277
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,929
Are you okay? Did you get shot?

278
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,683
-Han Tae-sul…
-Are you okay?

279
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:49,060
Hey! Stay with me!

280
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,479
Are you okay? Stay with me!

281
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,065
Hey!

282
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,734
Darn it.

283
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,571
<i>Han Tae-sul! Get down!</i>

284
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,782
I said, get down!

285
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:19,984
Darn it.

286
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,408
Tae-sul!

287
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,744
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

288
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,248
-Tae-sul, look over here.
-What are you doing?

289
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,290
Are you okay?

290
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,544
-Of course not.
-How much do you remember?

291
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,462
What?

292
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,716
You got shot at the conference.

293
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,468
Fortunately, it was just a graze.

294
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,054
It just barely missed your artery
by a centimeter.

295
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,182
We got the culprit. He must've had
issues with our company.

296
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,934
-Tae-sul, let me see.
-Stop it.

297
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,354
-You can't get up yet. Stay in bed!
-Tae-sul!

298
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,355
Let me go!

299
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,774
Hey, you got shot!
We thought you were dead!

300
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,986
-You've been in a coma until--
-What the hell are you talking about?

301
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,075
Han Tae-sul! Get down!

302
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,208
What…

303
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,169
What are you two up to?

304
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,671
Tae-sul.

305
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,173
Where's Seo-hae?

306
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,426
-Who?
-Where's Seo-hae?

307
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,095
The girl who ran out
of the conference hall with me.

308
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,848
-Tae-sul.
-She saved my life.

309
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,641
And we went into hiding together.

310
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,311
And Sigma. What happened to Sigma?

311
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,854
And my brother?

312
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,480
Where's Tae-san?

313
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,525
-Tae-san is dead. Calm down.
-Tell me, Seo-jin.

314
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,694
I visited your place.

315
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,863
I went to your hospital. When was that?

316
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,533
It was four days
after the PEXCO incident, so…

317
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,453
August. August 19th.

318
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,039
Where's that girl you treated?

319
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,498
-Tae-sul.
-What?

320
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,668
Today is August 19th.

321
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,554
What are you talking about?

322
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,515
AUGUST 19, WEDNESDAY

323
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,355
-How dare you lie to me?
-Tae-sul.

324
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,523
-Tae-sul, stop it.
-Tae-sul, please!!

325
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,775
-Tae-sul!
-Move.

326
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,284
AUGUST 19, WEDNESDAY

327
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,411
What?

328
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,877
What's going on?

329
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,715
Why are you doing this to me?

330
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,219
You're all trying to fool me, right?

331
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,137
Hey, Kim Seung-bok.

332
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,348
You said on the phone
that you'll hold a funeral for me.

333
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,518
And you were all excited
after taking over my management rights,

334
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,938
held a party to celebrate
and drank yourself silly!

335
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,359
Tae-sul, what's wrong?

336
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,362
Tae-sul! It's okay. Breathe slowly.

337
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,617
Give me my phone.
I need to contact Seo-hae.

338
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,329
-Tae-sul, please stop!
-Right back at you, you jerk!

339
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,081
You jerks.

340
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,750
Do you think you can fool me?

341
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,294
Who ordered you to do this?

342
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,214
Seo-jin. Did your father
put you up to this?

343
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,676
-Tae-sul. Calm down.
-Calm down.

344
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,095
-I know everything.
-What?

345
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,596
I know you were all in on it.

346
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,058
How? I saw and heard everything
at your place.

347
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,020
You were going to hand over
my technology to Sigma.

348
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,896
It's the uploader, right?

349
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,649
Tell me. Who ordered you to do this?

350
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,360
Is it Sigma? Or the Control Bureau?

351
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,820
And you!

352
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,740
You already knew about people
coming from the future!

353
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,409
-Tae-sul!
-Tae-sul!

354
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,620
Don't run!

355
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,423
What's going on?

356
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,550
What's the date?

357
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,636
August 19th? Damn it!

358
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,058
Let go of me!

359
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,019
Let me go, you jerks!

360
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,730
-Tae-sul.
-It's okay, Tae-sul.

361
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,649
-Stay still. It's going to be okay.
-No, don't do it.

362
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,861
No! Don't do this!

363
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,946
-Tae-sul.
-Don't do this.

364
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,490
Don't do this.

365
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,909
Don't

366
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,870
do this.

367
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,831
Don't…

368
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,796
<i>Next news.
Quantum & Time's CEO, Han Tae-sul,</i>

369
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,423
<i>miraculously gained consciousness
this morning.</i>

370
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,549
<i>Reporter Choi Ji-eun.</i>

371
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,802
Quantum & Time's CEO, Han Tae-sul,

372
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,887
gained consciousness
this morning at 11 a.m.

373
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,932
It's been four days
since he fell into a critical state

374
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,850
after the shooting incident at PEXCO.

375
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,646
The medical staff stated
that his life is not at risk,

376
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,898
but he is still recovering,

377
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,526
so he may not return
to his position as CEO yet.

378
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,532
This is all my fault.

379
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,992
No, it's his fault
that he's gone mad like that.

380
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,870
No. I should've treated him
properly since the beginning.

381
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,498
When he said strange things
and had hallucinations--

382
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,792
You know how stubborn he is.

383
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,796
I should've stopped him
from going to the conference.

384
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,015
<i>There's this thing called confabulation.</i>

385
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,644
It usually occurs in alcoholics.

386
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,773
When the frontal lobe is damaged,
you suffer memory loss.

387
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,609
And you start making up things
to fill in those gaps.

388
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,696
Then you start believing they're real.

389
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:02,160
What's more,
you were addicted to drugs before that.

390
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,329
And when you were shot…
I told you, remember?

391
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,331
You had an epidural hemorrhage.

392
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,877
It's this spot right here.

393
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,130
I think you're getting such symptoms
from the aftereffects.

394
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,049
You may have certain delusions

395
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,428
or sometimes confuse dreams with reality.

396
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,082
You're finally home.

397
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,832
Vitamin B will help you recover.

398
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,464
They're tranquilizers.

399
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,217
Please don't waste your energy.

400
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,181
Drink the juice too.

401
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,444
I saw Tae-san.

402
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,117
It's true. It was Tae-san.

403
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,704
I saw him when I was making the speech

404
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,247
at the conference.

405
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,501
He was standing among the reporters,
looking around for something.

406
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,963
And then I got shot,

407
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,132
and a woman saved me.

408
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,135
-Seo-hae?
-Yes, Seo-hae.

409
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,139
You probably don't believe me,
but it's true.

410
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,766
We're not the only ones
living in this world.

411
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,478
They say I'm going to build
a time machine.

412
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,731
They call it the uploader.

413
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,984
Some people from the future
are taking it to come here,

414
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,362
And there's a bureau that catches
such people. There are brokers, too.

415
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,741
And one of those people

416
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,701
is trying to kill me.

417
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,871
-Like <i>The Terminator</i>?
-Yes.

418
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,082
And this woman named Seo-hae
is protecting you?

419
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,585
She says the world is going to end.

420
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,170
To be exact,

421
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,714
a nuclear bomb will go off in Korea, and…

422
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,303
Never mind.

423
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,181
It sounds crazy even as I'm saying it.

424
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,102
Seo-jin told me to listen to you,
whatever you say.

425
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,857
She says you shouldn't use the internet.
I disconnected the Wi-Fi.

426
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,236
Just hang in there for a while.
When Seo-jin says it's okay, I'll--

427
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,321
Seung-bok.

428
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,656
What?

429
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,825
Be honest with me.

430
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,745
You're lying, right?

431
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,289
-No.
-Are you sure?

432
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,791
Yes.

433
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,924
Then have I really lost my mind?

434
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,094
You've just had a rough time.
Things were too--

435
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,096
You and I

436
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:54,558
have been friends all along, Seung-bok.

437
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,520
Swear on our friendship,

438
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,898
look into my eyes and tell me.

439
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,403
You're lying right now, aren't you?

440
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,454
I'd rather wish I were.

441
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,514
Get some rest. I'll get going.

442
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,395
Right.

443
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,524
Those pills could give you
a slight headache.

444
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,444
Get some rest.

445
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,379
Is your head hurting again?

446
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,014
It's because you're low on sugar.

447
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,350
It's inevitable for people
who use their brains all the time.

448
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,269
You should have some chocolate.

449
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,563
It's been a while.

450
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,113
I've always been by your side.

451
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,783
Shut up, please!

452
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,631
That's the N Seoul Tower.

453
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,510
So that's what it looked like originally.

454
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,304
What does it look like in the future?

455
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,432
It's collapsed to the side.

456
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,770
<i>The future is</i>

457
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,149
<i>very different from now. There's nothing.</i>

458
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,571
<i>But I have to protect you.</i>

459
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,116
<i>You're the only person I know
whether from the past, present, or future.</i>

460
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,494
<i>Do you know what it's like to be alone?</i>

461
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:51,034
-You should've visited more often.
-Sorry. I was busy.

462
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,799
Mom, are you feeling better now?

463
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,718
I'm always doing great.

464
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,678
Take care of yourself, all right?

465
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,432
Okay. I'll take good care of myself.

466
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,435
-So don't get sick, Mom.
-Okay.

467
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:07,853
You're here.

468
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,688
Hello.

469
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,565
Come to my study.

470
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,319
-Go on.
-Okay.

471
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,533
How's Tae-sul?

472
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,745
I guess he's still feeling confused.

473
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,124
He must be.

474
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,795
He's taking a lot of drugs.

475
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,422
How much?

476
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,009
Take this.

477
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,929
It'll help with your headaches.

478
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,569
Does your head hurt a lot?

479
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,238
And your hallucinations?

480
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,657
Which hallucinations?

481
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,202
The ones I used to have, or the new ones?

482
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,955
I heard you told Eddy everything.

483
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,293
It was real.

484
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,546
I don't know.

485
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,050
I don't know if it was real or not,

486
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,596
but that situation, those feelings…

487
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,767
I remember everything. I mean it.

488
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,648
That's what your senses are like.

489
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,653
You said it's a nuclear war, right?

490
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,072
There have been news reports
in the last two months

491
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,284
about talks with the US
and nuclear missiles in North Korea.

492
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,621
You must've made up stories in your head

493
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,082
with things like that
in your subconscious.

494
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,585
A time machine?

495
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,630
I guess you want to go back to the past.

496
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,467
It's a typical delusion.

497
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:09,975
Tae-sul.

498
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,228
Let's get you treated properly this time.

499
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,607
If you don't recover fully,
you'll have to get hospitalized.

500
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,985
Then you know
you'll have to step down as CEO.

501
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,752
Doctors aren't supposed to go along
with the patient's delusions,

502
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:41,006
but we can try this method
if they don't show any progress.

503
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,342
Look at this.

504
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,803
This is what you told Eddy.

505
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,020
Maybe you should think
about why you have such delusions

506
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:59,024
and why you've been making up
these stories in your mind.

507
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,276
You're smart.

508
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,320
Is it guilt?

509
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,658
Or is it anxiety

510
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,368
about losing your company?

511
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,370
Stop.

512
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,913
Or is it pressure

513
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,666
about having to be better than others?

514
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,167
I told you to stop!

515
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,506
Or is it a kind of defense mechanism?

516
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,427
Is it hard to build relationships?

517
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,560
Is that why you treat others badly
before you get hurt by anyone?

518
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,109
Hey. What did you give me?

519
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,026
You…

520
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,198
I read everything you said,

521
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,285
but there's one thing that doesn't add up.

522
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,204
What?

523
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,125
The key.

524
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,296
Where's the key?

525
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,101
By the time this is over,

526
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,604
Tae-sul won't be able to recover
because of the drugs.

527
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,189
I got a locked ward prepared for him.

528
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,609
What about Eddy?

529
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,486
He thinks it's just a treatment.

530
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,115
The only thing on his mind
is taking over the management rights.

531
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,331
And the key?

532
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,211
I'll find it soon.

533
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,673
We have to find that key.

534
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:54,014
Your mom won't survive
without the medicine they give us.

535
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,521
SATURDAY, FRIDAY, THURSDAY, WEDNESDAY

536
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,773
TUESDAY, MONDAY, SUNDAY, SATURDAY

537
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,579
<i>Where's the key?</i>

538
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,669
If what you said is true,
you had the key on you

539
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,421
before the party at our house.

540
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,297
But you don't have it now.

541
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,261
Did you hide it?

542
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,515
Or…

543
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,436
does the woman named Seo-hae
from your delusions have it?

544
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,712
Hey. Where's the key?

545
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,009
You made a promise, you know.

546
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,180
I don't know.

547
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,933
You little jerk.
You have no sense of ethics.

548
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,395
Shoot him.

549
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,071
If you keep insisting, you'll get hurt.

550
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,616
Not just you, but everyone you know.

551
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,494
So don't waste your energy and tell me.
Where's the key?

552
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,414
I told you I don't know. I swear!

553
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,805
Seo-hae.

554
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,188
Seo-hae?

555
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,440
Seo-hae.

556
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,406
What?

557
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,587
The time.

558
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,471
It's 22:00.

559
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,351
The moon.

560
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,613
The moon's azimuth.

561
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,454
It's 315,9 degrees.

562
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,667
Then the date is…

563
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,590
September 15th.

564
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,801
A month after we first met
at the conference.

565
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,015
Right.

566
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,642
A month after we first met.

567
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,439
That's right. I remember everything.

568
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,066
I remember everything about you.

569
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,235
Five.

570
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,195
What?

571
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:23,658
Four. Three. Two. One.

572
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,999
My goodness.

573
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,376
That startled me.

574
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,880
What was that? It suddenly dropped.

575
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,721
I'll clean that up later.

576
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,973
Tae-sul!

577
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,560
Be careful. You'll hurt your feet!

578
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,026
This isn't mine.

579
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,611
What?

580
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,571
This isn't mine.

581
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,660
Tae-sul, let's pick up where we left off.

582
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,913
Do you remember where the key is now?

583
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,920
Is that important right now?
I made it up, anyway.

584
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,758
Or did it all happen in real life?

585
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:25,762
<i>This is an EMP.</i>

586
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,683
If something happens,
push this red button.

587
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,060
Then it'll cause a blackout
in the whole building,

588
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,270
and we won't be able to communicate.

589
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:42,195
I DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED, EITHER

590
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,950
-What is it?
-Nothing.

591
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,745
-What's that?
-I gave this to someone.

592
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,623
But it's right here.

593
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,467
What are you doing, Tae-sul?

594
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,601
Bring all the guards in.

595
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,358
Tae-sul, that's enough.

596
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,360
Just stay still, okay?

597
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,030
If you don't, you'll get hurt!

598
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,114
Seo-jin.

599
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,616
Let's stop now.

600
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,162
And watch your feet.

601
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,293
-Get him!
-What? Turn the lights on!

602
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,004
Tae-sul!

603
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,213
Han Tae-sul!

604
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,466
Darn it!

605
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,731
Tae-sul.

606
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,650
He can't have gone far.

607
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,082
Why are you here? I said I'll take care--

608
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,709
Where is Tae-sul? What about the police?

609
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,920
It'll complicate things.
I didn't report it.

610
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,296
Just call the cops.

611
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,052
EMERGENCY SERVICES

612
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,436
Who are those people?

613
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,231
I'm going to send Tae-sul to the hospital.

614
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,358
-You said he'll be okay.
-No.

615
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,444
He's in a risky state.
That's my opinion as a doctor.

616
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,991
Seo-jin.

617
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,285
Why are you doing this?

618
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,834
Is there something I don't know?

619
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,212
No, there isn't.

620
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,882
Just do as you're told,
like you've always done.

621
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,634
Then you can become the CEO.

622
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,678
Got that?

623
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,267
Anything else you want to ask?

624
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,217
The operation was going to fail anyway.

625
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,516
It could've been because of the wind,

626
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,019
or the EMP.

627
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,856
Or because your hand
suddenly started shaking.

628
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:08,818
Whatever the reason, it was bound to fail.

629
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,615
PERFORMANCE REPORT

630
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,742
OPERATION EXPECTED TO FAIL

631
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,790
Why did you tell me to do it, then?

632
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,709
Would you not have done it if you knew?

633
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,962
-I still would.
-Let me offer you some advice.

634
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,591
Don't try too hard.

635
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,843
You need to do your best,
but don't overdo it.

636
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,846
Some things work out,
and some things don't.

637
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,476
Just memorize that
if you want to keep working here.

638
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,230
"Some things work out. Some things don't."

639
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,982
That woman. Her!

640
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,443
Can I catch her?

641
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,154
You said you know what happens.

642
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,657
If I say you can't, will you give up?

643
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,869
-No.
-Then why do you ask?

644
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,050
You'll catch her.

645
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,303
So just trust me and wait.

646
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,086
CEO HAN TAE-SUL'S RETURN
TO MANAGEMENT POSITION UNCLEAR

647
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,380
How did things get so messed up?

648
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:06,269
Spread out and find him.
Make sure to block all the exits.

649
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,132
Darn it.

650
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,983
A telephone? There's no cord.

651
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,446
Okay!

652
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,090
Ringing tones are set at 2,600 Hz.

653
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,805
Please work.

654
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,724
Come on. Please work.

655
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,728
Yes! It's working!

656
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,948
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hello? Is it you, Seo-hae?

657
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,325
-Is that you?
-<i>Yes.</i>

658
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,453
Hey.

659
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,456
Are you okay?
Did you manage to escape that day?

660
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:55,086
Yes. I saw the news.
You seemed to be doing fine.

661
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:56,879
Me?

662
01:01:56,963 --> 01:02:00,967
I'm telling you this because you should
adjust to the modern society.

663
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,846
You shouldn't believe everything
the media says.

664
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:08,015
The world isn't that honest.

665
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,353
-What's going on?
-Seo-hae, listen carefully.

666
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,356
You're the only person I can trust

667
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,984
whether from the past, present, or future.

668
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,362
I ran away from home,

669
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,407
and I'm in huge trouble right now.

670
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,367
Can you help me?

671
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:27,994
<i>Where are you?</i>

672
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:31,789
I'm at Hannam Tool Market.

673
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,208
<i>I'm a bit busy right now, though.</i>

674
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,670
What? What are you doing?

675
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,715
-<i>I'm just busy.</i>
-Hey, you can't do this to me!

676
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,676
-<i>Get down.</i>
-What?

677
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,928
-<i>I said, get down.</i>
-What?

678
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:54,687
Hello? Seo-hae?

679
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,567
Oh, my gosh. What the heck?

680
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,781
What was that?

681
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,925
Darn it.

682
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,734
Hey. Why are you here?

683
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,319
You said you were busy.

684
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,739
What can I do? You said
I was the only one you could trust.

685
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,241
What?

686
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,326
This part is my favorite.

687
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,954
It's romantic.

688
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,791
Don't you agree, Mr. Han Tae-san?

689
01:05:15,338 --> 01:05:16,881
<i>Help me save Tae-sul.</i>

690
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:19,425
You think you can change the future?

691
01:05:21,594 --> 01:05:22,804
<i>I can change it.</i>

692
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:26,307
<i>Who is Sigma?</i>

693
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,686
<i>I met your brother.</i>

694
01:05:29,769 --> 01:05:31,354
<i>I figured out who Sigma is.</i>

695
01:05:31,938 --> 01:05:33,481
<i>He was right next to us all along.</i>

696
01:05:34,065 --> 01:05:35,900
<i>You must not turn off the downloader.</i>

697
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,861
<i>And the other person who's watching this.</i>

698
01:05:38,945 --> 01:05:40,196
You just stay put,

699
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:42,865
because I will find you.
