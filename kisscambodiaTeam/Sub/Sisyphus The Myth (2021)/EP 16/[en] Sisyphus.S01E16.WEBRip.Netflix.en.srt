1
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,978
ALL NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL

2
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,815
Just kill me!

3
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,358
Kill me!

4
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,029
-What's going on?
-He might really kill her.

5
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,406
-What do we do?
-They must be crazy.

6
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,492
-Should we call the police?
-Oh, my goodness.

7
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,994
-He's really killing her.
-Unbelievable.

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,913
-My goodness.
-My gosh.

9
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,227
Don't.

10
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,234
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you follow me here?

11
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,528
Go back to the store basement.

12
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:57,033
Everyone's going to die
when the war breaks out.

13
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:58,910
Go.

14
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,705
-Come with me.
-You brat.

15
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,545
I said, go. Go before I kill you first.

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,506
Go and live.

17
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,846
Just kill me!

18
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,183
Stop saying you'll kill me
and just do it, you loser!

19
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,234
What's your relationship
with the guy who's been sending you

20
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,777
money?

21
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,322
Ji-eun's been starving because
you can't even put bread on the table!

22
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,116
What else could I do?

23
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,535
-Hey, be quiet!
-Why would I?

24
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,203
Ji-eun will hear you. Shut up!

25
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,956
What have you ever done for me?

26
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,084
You've never brought home money
or given me jewels.

27
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,503
And what? Cheating?

28
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,715
How dare you talk like that to me!

29
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,133
Dad!

30
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,637
Let's just go.

31
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,142
Let's go, Dad.

32
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,861
KIM JIN-HUI
MONEY TRANSFER

33
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,199
KIM JIN-HUI

34
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,045
I took the uploader with Mom.

35
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,548
Mom told me to go and find you

36
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,508
if she didn't make it.

37
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,180
You're

38
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,225
my daughter, Ji-eun?

39
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,483
-Then why didn't you tell me?
-Because I hated you!

40
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,653
I was going to run away with Mom.

41
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,908
I've been waiting for her,
but she won't come.

42
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,119
Darn it.

43
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,541
Just beat me! Kill me!

44
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,629
I want to die!
I don't want to live anymore!

45
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,673
So don't go, Dad.

46
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,549
I'll be alone again if you go.

47
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,137
Go to the basement.

48
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,348
You'll die out here.

49
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,434
I won't go by myself!

50
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,770
Mom always told me

51
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,605
that you were a jerk,

52
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,483
but you wouldn't have hurt her back then.

53
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,110
That you wouldn't have dared.

54
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,778
You were an asshole,

55
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,281
but you weren't that evil.

56
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,992
Who keeps sending you money?
Who the hell is it?

57
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,577
So don't go in there.

58
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,746
Would I still be here if I knew?

59
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,084
-Please.
-I feel upset too!

60
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,794
Just trust me.

61
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,846
Just kill me.

62
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,558
I don't want to live anymore.

63
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,811
Please kill me.

64
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,522
All right.

65
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,568
Let's just die together today.

66
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,952
It's okay! I remember this day.

67
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,747
Nothing will happen.

68
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,000
So trust me, just this once.

69
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,192
Dad.

70
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,155
Ji-eun.

71
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,241
Are you fighting again?

72
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,660
No, Ji-eun.

73
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,829
Let's go to bed, okay?

74
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,375
Dad, what's wrong?

75
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,301
Ji-eun.

76
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,394
I couldn't even recognize my own child.

78
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,565
I wouldn't have come here

79
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,233
if I hadn't killed anyone.

80
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:28,030
Everything has changed now.

81
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,954
Let's go to your Mom.

82
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,547
Oh, no. I won again.

83
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,593
Jae-sun is dead.

84
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,430
You shouldn't have left like that.

85
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,898
I had my reasons.

86
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,158
I'm just worried.

87
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,744
Are you sure your plan is still working?

88
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,218
It's still working, right?

89
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,388
All right.

90
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,474
You know what's going to happen, right?

91
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,527
Seo-hae.

92
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,832
Seo-hae.

93
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
Is it the girl or the world?

94
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,674
You can only choose one.

95
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,431
No.

96
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,359
You won't get what you want this time.

97
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,197
You're not in your wedding dress.

98
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,991
I'm a misogamist.

99
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,159
What a relief.

100
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,913
Don't make the uploader.
If you don't, we'll win.

101
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,128
Han Tae-sul. Are you listening?

102
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,839
Don't make it.

103
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,176
Seo-hae.

104
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,308
Whatever happens from now on,

105
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,852
just trust me.

106
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,814
No matter what happens.

107
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,443
Everything will be fine.

108
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,820
I mean it.

109
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,203
I mean it, too.

110
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,100
The uploader code.

111
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,979
Or I'll shoot the girl.

112
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,656
Five, four, three, two…

113
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,117
Hey, wait.

114
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,953
-What?
-I'm not saying I'll do it.

115
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,372
I'm just curious about something.
Give me a minute.

116
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,166
Two, one.

117
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,752
Hey, I really won't do it
if you don't answer me.

118
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,462
What is it?

119
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,215
You said…

120
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,677
What time is it?

121
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,512
Yes, about right now.

122
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,434
You said you were about
to commit suicide at home.

123
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,521
And before that,

124
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,233
you were crying and hiding in the park.

125
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,526
So?

126
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,113
You even ran away without paying
for the cab fare. How much was it?

127
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,032
Why do you ask?

128
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,785
You get curious about everything
just before you die.

129
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,996
I have this kind of obsession

130
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,290
about details.

131
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,960
It really bothers me. I feel like
I won't be able to rest in peace.

132
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:37,298
You wrote hate comments online,
didn't pay for the cab fare,

133
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,925
and destroyed the world.

134
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,805
You're a real scumbag, aren't you?

135
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,392
Do you think you can win
by buying time like this?

136
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,519
You're totally wrong there.

137
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,689
Why?
First of all, I'm not just buying time.

138
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,567
Second,
I already told you I was going to win.

139
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,488
You're all talk, aren't you?

140
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,739
No, I'm not.

141
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,167
What? Did you not expect this?

142
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,671
The future can change.
It's boring if it's always the same.

143
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,300
You want to know what happened?
Count to five if you're curious.

144
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,719
Never mind, I'll count.

145
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:29,308
Five, four, three, two…

146
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,150
Hey, you're getting a call. Take it.

147
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,371
Who is this?

148
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,722
What was that?

149
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,642
Do you know what that sound is?

150
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,190
It's the sound of nails
being hammered to your coffin.

151
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,027
The future is changing.

152
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,406
Didn't I tell you that I saw it?

153
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,494
Enough fooling around.

154
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,415
I don't know what you're playing at,
but it's over.

155
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,962
-Start coding.
-You can't shoot her.

156
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,424
I've already done it before.
That's how I'm here.

157
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,365
Shoot her!

158
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,125
The gun!

159
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,387
You bastard!

160
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,528
Han Tae-sul.

161
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,623
What have you done to me?

162
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,628
Why don't you ask for help again?

163
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,256
Oh, is there no one to help you now?

164
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,175
Your dad's dead,

165
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,136
and so is that kid
who followed you around.

166
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,931
Han Tae-sul's going to die too.

167
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,601
You're used to being alone,

168
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,147
aren't you?

169
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,080
Are you okay?

170
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,467
No, this is impossible.

171
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,013
What did you do, Tae-sul?

172
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,147
Don't look at me like that.

173
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,569
I hate you.

174
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,907
I hate everyone

175
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,368
in this world.

176
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,922
When the sun sets in Seoul…

177
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,677
with nobody in it,

178
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,557
it's red everywhere.

179
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,021
And the night sky…

180
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,942
is filled with stars.

181
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,155
It's so quiet.

182
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,494
It's as if

183
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,706
I'm alone in the world.

184
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,897
Hey.

185
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,360
Seo-hae.

186
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,573
Don't you miss it?

187
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,367
No.

188
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,453
Not at all.

189
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,690
Are you all right?

190
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,026
Yes.

191
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,031
Someone shot Sigma from over there.

192
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,200
Right.

193
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,410
Who was it?

194
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,500
Is everything over now?

195
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,347
Let's go.

196
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,390
Where?

197
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,852
Seo-hae.

198
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,981
What's important…

199
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:39,404
Wow, I never thought I'd say this to you.

200
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,866
But what's important isn't "where."

201
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,787
What's important is "when."

202
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,259
The uploader.

203
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,719
Yes, the uploader.

204
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,431
We have to take the uploader.

205
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,102
Let's go and finish this.

206
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,416
There's nobody here.

207
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,668
I guess they all disappeared, too.

208
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,599
Darn it. What's going on?

209
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,435
What should we do?

210
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,603
He doesn't know anything yet.

211
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,734
He's going to go upstairs
to find out what's going on.

212
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,278
Nothing good will come from
meeting him, so let's wait.

213
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,573
Jeez.

214
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,910
The person you are calling is unavailable…

215
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,843
Wow. It's huge.

216
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,303
Did you take this, too?

217
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,556
Yes. It was a bit dirtier, though.

218
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,909
But if you make it work…

219
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,036
I'll make sure it can be used only once.

220
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,996
Can you get it running automatically?

221
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,706
I had to get shots and stuff.

222
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,416
No, I need someone to help me.

223
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,919
-Who?
-They're coming.

224
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,890
But why didn't you tell me?
How long have you known?

225
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,935
Since the day I locked you in the bunker.

226
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,271
-Why didn't you tell me back then?
-Well…

227
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,191
Seo-hae, just hang on.
I'll tell you in a moment.

228
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,568
This part is pretty complicated.

229
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,494
See? Look at you.

230
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,080
You always show your emotions
on your face.

231
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,666
If you had known,

232
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,168
your face would've
given everything away to Sigma.

233
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,254
Are you saying I'm emotional?

234
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,965
Who's the one who got emotional
and let Seo Gil-bok go?

235
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,635
What? I wasn't prepared for that
back then.

236
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,137
And I'm not talking about that.

237
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,307
I'm just saying
that you're not good at lying.

238
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,060
Good for you. You're such a good liar.

239
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,232
What kind of a conversation is this?

240
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,193
And when did I ever lie to you?

241
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,028
You lied to me just now.

242
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,989
-When did I lie to you?
-Goodness.

243
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,617
Hey!

244
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,415
My goodness.

245
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,376
Nice.

246
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,882
It seems like you two are bickering
every time I see you.

247
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,135
And when you're not together,
you're always looking for each other.

248
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,305
So… Wait.

249
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,308
What about Sigma?

250
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,436
-He's dead.
-Really?

251
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,645
Yes.

252
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,024
I see.

253
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:49,112
And is this the new uploader?

254
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,740
-What about the coding?
-Hang on.

255
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:08,298
-So we just have to send you there?
-Yes.

256
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:13,136
But we only know how to use downloaders.

257
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,973
-So?
-I'm not saying we won't do it.

258
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,226
But we could make a mistake

259
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,896
and you might arrive there
without your limbs or something.

260
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,857
-We don't have time.
-If it doesn't matter, fine.

261
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,443
Prep our guests.

262
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,619
-Wait.
-Don't worry. Give me your arm.

263
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,212
That hurts. Why does it hurt so much?

264
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,382
Stop making a fuss.
It's my second time, you know.

265
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,592
Wait.

266
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,804
-Hang on. Give me your vest.
-What? Why?

267
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,473
We don't know what may happen.
We could get hit by stuff.

268
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,480
-Give yours to Seo-hae.
-I don't need one.

269
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,110
We should always be prepared.

270
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,993
Everything's ready. Oh, hang on.

271
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,494
Okay. Everything's ready.

272
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,579
Mr. Park. Come over here.

273
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,916
Are you sure

274
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,003
we can trust her?

275
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,174
Yes. She's pretty skilled.

276
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,553
But why are you helping us?
We have nothing to give you anymore.

277
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,806
Just because.

278
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,183
Mr. Han.

279
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,811
When you arrive there,

280
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,481
-you'll come and find me, right?
-Of course.

281
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,277
I wasn't so sure back then,

282
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,656
so tell me exactly the same thing again

283
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,243
when you find me, okay?

284
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,956
-Okay.
-Take care.

285
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,794
And you take care, too.

286
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,506
And I hope we never meet again.

287
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,428
Hey.

288
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,183
For you not to throw up.

289
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,205
Does this hurt?

290
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,082
Yes. It hurts a lot.

291
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,292
Your body is shattered
and put back together.

292
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,335
Really?

293
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,923
No. You just get a bit dizzy
and feel nauseous.

294
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,050
That's a relief.

295
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,803
Let's begin.

296
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,771
It's ready.

297
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,442
Have a nice trip!

298
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,570
Three.

299
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:22,951
Two.

300
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,870
One.

301
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,910
Hi.

302
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,203
Are you okay?

303
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:12,959
It feels like I'm still spinning.

304
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,463
What time is this?

305
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,007
The day

306
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,010
I locked you in the bunker.

307
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,930
Probably about now.

308
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,683
Let's go. The Control Bureau will come.

309
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,059
No, they won't come.

310
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,773
-What?
-They're busy looking for you.

311
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,776
They don't care about illegal entrants.
We shouldn't move around.

312
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,906
Is that why you locked me in there?
So we wouldn't get caught now?

313
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,783
Yes.

314
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,662
Why didn't you tell me? You little…

315
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:54,167
Wait. I'm not in a stable state right now.
I feel like my body's shattering.

316
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,254
Let's stay like this a little bit.
We didn't get to rest for several days.

317
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,967
-Come on. Get up.
-Just a little bit.

318
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,886
Come on.

319
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,554
Jeez.

320
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,016
Wait here.

321
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,851
Why? I'm coming with you.

322
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,729
You're locked in the bunker right now.

323
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,315
It's better for you to stay here
without being seen.

324
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,942
Where are you going?

325
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,820
The bathroom. Are you coming too?

326
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,114
-Hey, there's no time to--
-Oh, your shoelace is untied.

327
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,951
Tie that firmly. We'll have to run a lot.

328
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,452
Hey.

329
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,121
Darn it.

330
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,434
Let's go.

331
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,770
Are we going to Mr. Park?

332
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,773
No. There's somewhere else to go first.

333
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,701
DONGDAEMUN POLICE STATION

334
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,870
Why are we here?

335
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,788
Your father.

336
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,168
Sigma told us earlier
where Seo Gil-bok will be tomorrow.

337
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,964
-In the park.
-Yes. So we should catch him

338
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,924
since we have to go back to the church.

339
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,516
It's Dad.

340
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,437
Let's go tomorrow morning. All right.

341
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,698
Dad.

342
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,284
What is it?

343
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,165
You told me to find you
if I needed any help.

344
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,879
If you catch Seo Gil-bok,

345
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,256
take care of him however you like.

346
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,258
And then call this number.

347
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,762
Some strange guy is going to answer,
but you can just hang up.

348
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:16,726
Can we stop the war if we catch him?

349
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:17,977
Probably.

350
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,190
All right.

351
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,806
Seo-hae.

352
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,022
Let me hug you.

353
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,497
All right.

354
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,589
I'll be off.

355
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,882
Okay.

356
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,573
Can't you read? It says we're closed!

357
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,162
Do you even know how to shoot a gun?

358
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,503
Oh, and a sniper rifle.

359
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,298
You're not Han Tae-sul, are you?

360
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,761
I'm not sure if you've heard this before.

361
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:19,807
"The future is already here.
We just don't know it yet."

362
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,774
The future you asked me to tell you this.

363
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,817
"Your daughter is right next to you.

364
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,488
But you've been wasting time
without recognizing her.

365
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,449
So you can stop it now. It's okay."

366
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,451
He asked me to tell you.

367
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,627
If you're free tomorrow,
come to the church.

368
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,718
Did you get it? After checking?

369
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:59,388
Yes. Why is it so heavy? Gosh.

370
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,349
Some people shoot it while holding it.

371
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,602
-We just have to go to the church now?
-Yes. Hang on.

372
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,105
What?

373
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,732
I can't carry this all the way there.

374
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,068
It's pretty far. I called a cab.

375
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,695
-A cab?
-Why isn't he coming?

376
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,952
Oh, there he is.

377
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,553
Hey! I told you not to be late.

378
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,642
Seo-hae, you're surprised, aren't you?
Well, I…

379
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,645
I had this on.

380
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,157
Don't hit me. I can explain.

381
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,533
Oh, your shoelace is untied.

382
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,286
Tie that firmly. We'll have to run a lot.

383
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,922
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 30

384
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,592
I think it was around now.

385
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,262
ON GOVERNMENT DUTY

386
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,604
Oh, my gosh. What are you doing here?

387
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,189
Where's Seo-hae?

388
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,900
-Just wear this.
-What is it?

389
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,735
Seo-hae will die if you don't.

390
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,738
-What?
-And if you find Seo-hae,

391
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,949
you can't tell her you met me
or that you're wearing this.

392
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,659
Why?

393
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,703
This is the only way to save her.

394
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,998
-What are you talking about?
-Jae-sun. Just trust me.

395
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,791
We trusted each other

396
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,462
and saved Seo-hae
when she was at the Control Bureau, right?

397
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,092
Come to Asia Mart at eight. Don't be late.

398
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,812
Jae-sun.

399
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,482
You were pretending to be dead?

400
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,110
No! It really hurt like hell.
I almost died.

401
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,738
I actually fainted.

402
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,658
Are you mad at me?

403
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,411
You're mad, aren't you?
Please don't hit me…

404
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,512
Anything else you hid from me?

405
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,597
No.

406
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,058
You're lying.
You're good at lying, aren't you?

407
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,727
What are you talking about?
No, there's nothing else.

408
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,816
Come on, get in.
By the way, where do we go now?

409
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,948
Why bother hiding her?
You guys are in the palm of my hand.

410
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,702
Oh, what was his name?

411
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,746
Right, Sun. He's dead.

412
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,923
I had to infuriate her
to make her come here voluntarily.

413
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,926
Don't get too nervous.

414
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,679
It'll be quick.

415
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,279
-Let's go to the second floor.
-Okay.

416
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,255
How lovely is this?

417
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,468
You will make the uploader now. Why?

418
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,261
-Because you love her.
-Seo-hae.

419
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,223
-Get to your position.
-From beginning to end, all of it.

420
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,143
It was all part of my plan.

421
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,907
I'm just worried.
Are you sure your plan is still working?

422
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,748
It's still working, right?

423
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,503
Yes. My plan is just starting,
you asshole.

424
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,719
There was a fight over a cab fare
last night at Gangbuk Police Station.

425
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,765
-This is the only park nearby, right?
-Yes.

426
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,934
Where is this place?

427
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,521
Right here.
And this is where the station is.

428
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,233
Ten kilometers.
It'll only take three hours.

429
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,692
Tell them to keep looking.

430
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,613
Who is this Seo Gil-bok? What did he do?

431
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,445
Mr. Seo Gil-bok?

432
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,660
Yes?

433
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,149
Do you know what that sound is?

434
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,861
It's the sound of nails
being hammered to your coffin.

435
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:35,868
What was that?

436
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,746
The future is changing.

437
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,749
Didn't I tell you that I saw it?

438
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,294
Enough fooling around.

439
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,048
I don't know what you're playing at,
but it's over.

440
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,594
-Start coding.
-You can't shoot her.

441
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,972
I've already done it before.
That's how I'm here.

442
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,068
Are you really Seo Gil-bok?

443
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,695
Yes, I am.

444
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,143
Shoot her!

445
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,660
Seo-hae.

446
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,747
Can you hurry up?

447
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,498
Hang on.

448
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,791
The gun!

449
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,469
That bastard. How dare he hit her?

450
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,762
You bastard!

451
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,897
You shouldn't have done that.

452
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,733
I shouldn't have let him hit me like that.

453
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,323
Han Tae-sul.

454
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,871
What have you done to me?

455
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,461
Why don't you ask for help again?

456
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,507
Seo-hae. Are you okay?

457
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,093
It's a bit heavy.

458
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,226
It's almost over now.

459
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,187
We should ride the Viking next year.

460
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,082
Hey.

461
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,589
I'll save you, Seo-hae.

462
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,727
Good job.

463
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,855
Good job.

464
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,682
Seo-hae.

465
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,311
This is

466
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,107
as far as I saw.

467
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,560
Thank you…

468
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,357
for everything

469
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,818
you did for me.

470
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,710
Don't go.

471
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,925
Don't go.

472
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,761
Don't go.

473
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,605
Seo-hae.

474
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,316
Tae-sul.

475
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,154
What's going on?

476
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,629
Seo-hae!

477
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,674
Seo-hae! No!

478
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,968
Seo-hae.

479
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,721
Seo-hae!

480
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,807
Seo-hae.

481
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,900
Seung-bok.

482
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,029
Why?

483
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,784
Make it.

484
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,621
-Make the uploader.
-Why would you…

485
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,414
She'll die if you don't make it.

486
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,003
And you'll live the rest
of your life in regret. So make it.

487
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,048
It's a good thing.
You'll be able to get another chance.

488
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,884
I'll give you that chance.

489
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,094
So make it.

490
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,433
Don't listen to him.
You made that mistake over and over.

491
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,397
You can end everything. Don't do it.

492
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,194
Why are you doing this?

493
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,030
Why are you doing this to me?

494
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,742
Why?

495
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,914
Tae-sul. Do you know when my birthday is?

496
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,251
If you know, I'll stop.

497
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:53,879
But you don't.

498
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,590
We've known each other for 20 years.

499
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,675
I've had 20 birthdays during that time.

500
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:01,052
But you didn't care about me at all.

501
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,222
Do you know how many people
I kneeled to beg

502
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,349
and bowed to because of you?

503
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,728
If you know, I'll stop.

504
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,732
But you don't know, right?

505
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,652
Do you know how much I've suffered
taking care of your messes?

506
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,325
Seo-jin…

507
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,703
Do you know I liked her first?

508
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,126
I knew Seo-jin

509
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:36,046
before you did, and I liked her first.

510
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,257
You're the one who came between us.

511
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,385
You always stole what I had.

512
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:47,182
I gave you everything you asked for,
and gave you things before you even asked.

513
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,726
I gave up everything for you!

514
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:50,852
Why?

515
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,316
Because the company wouldn't exist
without you.

516
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,569
Because I was nothing but your sidekick!

517
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,031
But…

518
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,702
you've never thanked me for anything.

519
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,997
That's how it's always been.

520
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,083
Seung-bok, I…

521
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,962
I really cared for Seo-jin.

522
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,840
I liked her much more than you.

523
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,888
But she still likes you more.

524
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,265
I'm going to start over!

525
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:34,396
Kim Seung-bok. Stop this.
Stop, you crazy jerk!

526
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,398
Don't look at me like that.

527
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:40,318
Don't look at me with those eyes!

528
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,991
I'm going to go back.

529
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,953
I'm going to take everything
you have first.

530
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,332
Your research, your company, your girl!

531
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,126
I'll take everything.

532
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,047
You should learn

533
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,677
how it feels
to get everything taken away from you.

534
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,973
Choose.

535
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,437
-Is it the girl or the world?
-No…

536
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,857
No.

537
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,528
Please don't do it. Please.

538
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,530
Damn it.

539
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,534
Just choose!

540
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,371
All right! Fine!

541
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,497
I will.

542
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,293
I got it, so stop.

543
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:47,886
Seo-hae.

544
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,765
Let's go back.

545
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:53,892
Let's start over.

546
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:58,354
Let's go back to the past
and try this again.

547
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,982
Where should we go?

548
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,777
Should we go to Seo Gil-bok's house

549
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,866
so we can shoot him and end everything?

550
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,202
Or should we

551
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,830
just go hide in the bunker?

552
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:21,503
Or we could…

553
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,005
Seo-hae…

554
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,759
We could just go back

555
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,805
to the beginning.

556
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,267
To before we knew each other.

557
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,823
Hurry up.

558
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,513
Tae-sul…

559
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,070
Tae-sul…

560
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,824
I'm fine.

561
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,330
Just stop.

562
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,587
Or we'll have to repeat this
over and over again.

563
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,174
So just stop.

564
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,089
Is it done?

565
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,096
I'm asking if it's done.

566
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,670
Think carefully about this.

567
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,426
Seo-hae.

568
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,555
I get it now.

569
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,975
No.

570
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,020
I knew it all along.

571
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,649
This is the only way.

572
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,194
But

573
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,949
I keep fighting it…

574
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,289
because I want to be with you.

575
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,187
Come and find me.

576
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,943
Even if there's no future,

577
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,573
just come and find me.

578
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,538
Don't get sick or get hurt.

579
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,917
Be safe.

580
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:19,550
And come and find me.

581
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,641
Seo-hae.

582
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,325
Tae-sul!

583
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:02,672
-The weather is so nice.
-How nice.

584
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,807
Come and catch me!

585
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,019
Hey!

586
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,071
Come and catch me!

587
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:50,928
Tae-sul.

588
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,473
Tae-sul.

589
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,770
Do you remember what I said at the school?

590
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,650
My favorite color is pink,

591
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,822
and my favorite food

592
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,869
are bananas, bulgogi, and tteokbokki.

593
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,878
And my favorite person…

594
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,215
is you.

595
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,094
So don't forget that.

596
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,931
I'm sure we'll meet again.

597
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,060
I'll find you.

598
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,863
I love you.

599
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,052
You call this ramyeon?

600
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,596
The noodles turned completely soggy.

601
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,349
I want you to scarf it down
and make me a new one. Okay?

602
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,810
I'm sorry, sir. I'll get you a new one.

603
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:09,191
"White wine, Chardonnay, 2018."

604
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,446
Why is there a number at the end?

605
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,877
Why?

606
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,756
Well, never mind the wine.

607
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,390
"Korean meal. Naengchae."

608
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,685
What's naengchae?

609
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,316
I have no idea what these are.
You choose for me.

610
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,486
Which one is the best?

611
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,698
Come on. Which one's the best?

612
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,538
Hey, Han Tae-sul.
Why aren't you answering me?

613
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,124
You…

614
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,627
What?

615
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:15,132
Here's your water, sir.

616
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,636
Thank you.

617
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,613
Is something wrong?

618
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,660
No.

619
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,994
Hey, it's not working. Look.

620
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:18,297
Smile.

621
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,846
All right.

622
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,644
Here you go.

623
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,646
Thank you!

624
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:34,688
You're welcome.

625
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,484
Thank you.

626
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:15,604
I'm home.
