MEDICAL SCHOOL
ONE-DAY PUB

11
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,316
Nice.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,193
I wanted to ask you,

13
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,570
what's your name?

14
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm Shin Sol-i.

15
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,784
Your name is as pretty as you look.
Are you a freshman? What's your major?

16
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,494
Who invited you?

17
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,621
Well, I…

18
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,958
Why do you have so many questions?

19
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,669
Oh, you're Heon's friend.

20
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,755
There's hard liquor on that table.

21
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,927
Heon, I can hold my drink.

22
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,766
Why don't we play a game?

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,769
Playing a game will liven up the mood.

24
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,146
Yes, let's play a game.

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,731
How about the Game of Truth?

26
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,815
All right.

27
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,860
My bad. I'll spin it.

28
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,118
Goodness, it's Ji-hui.

29
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,202
Hey.

30
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,913
Okay, pay attention. I'll ask a question.

31
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,417
"There's someone I like here." Yes or no?

32
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,837
Come on. Say it.

33
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,632
Say it.

34
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,841
-Say it.
-Say it

35
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,885
-Say it.
-Say it.

36
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,969
-Say it.
-Say it.

37
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,137
-Say it.
-Say it.

38
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,430
No way.

39
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,807
Well, I…

40
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,478
You like someone. Who is it?

41
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,073
Sol-i. Help me.

42
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,950
-Love shot.
-Okay.

43
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,077
I like

44
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,746
-Cha--
-Ouch!

45
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,793
I have

46
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,463
a sudden stomachache.

47
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,798
-Right now?
-Yes.

48
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,138
My girlfriend isn't feeling well.

49
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,890
We'll get going.

50
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,267
Let's go.

51
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,728
-What?
-She's his girlfriend?

52
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,406
Heon,

53
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,242
I have a question.

54
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,744
What is it?

55
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,162
Earlier…

56
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,706
I mean,

57
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,501
by any chance, did you

58
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,464
really just call me your girlfriend?

59
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:43,181
I mean, I'm not sure if I heard it right.

60
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,480
I did.

61
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,319
Since when?
Since when was I your girlfriend?

62
00:03:58,989 --> 00:03:59,948
I don't know.

63
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,877
Heon. My boyfriend.

64
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,629
Wait for me!

65
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,804
Sol-i, are you that happy
that you're Heon's girlfriend now?

66
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,681
Yes, I am.

67
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,974
I'm so happy.

68
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,894
All your hard work paid off.

69
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,103
You finally made it.

70
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,855
Ha-young.

71
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,357
Heon and I

72
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,067
even held hands.

73
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,487
That's great.

74
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,198
"Hands"?

75
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,617
-You've only held hands so far?
-Yes.

76
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,702
Sol-i.

77
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,038
You're still a baby.

78
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,414
What do you mean?

79
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,250
How far have you gone with Heon so far?

80
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,211
What?

81
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,465
Then, you and Jin-hwan…

82
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,550
No way!

83
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,722
Baby, you have so much to learn from me.

84
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,225
Let's take care of those clothes first.
Let's go.

85
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,477
-Now?
-Finish your drink.

86
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,825
What are you doing tonight?

87
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,035
What? Tonight?

88
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,162
Nothing much.

89
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,458
In that case,
don't go back to your dorm tonight.

90
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:34,876
Stay with me.

91
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,094
All night?

92
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,681
You and I together?

93
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,311
But I'm not mentally prepared.

94
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,649
Sol-i.

95
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,067
What are you imagining?

96
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,569
What?

97
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,654
I'm going to do my assignment
in the library.

98
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,324
I was asking you to stay with me
if you weren't busy.

99
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,416
I see.

100
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,003
That's what you meant.

101
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,643
Heon, the night air feels
nice and cool these days.

102
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,270
Right?

103
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,105
Right.

104
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,622
Sol-i.

105
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,956
Yes?

106
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,083
Where are you going?

107
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,501
I'm not going anywhere.

108
00:06:59,127 --> 00:06:59,961
Come here.

109
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,714
Why?

110
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,348
Okay.

111
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,872
Excuse me.

112
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,000
You're so my type.

113
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,043
May I have your number?

114
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,382
Hey! Who do you think you are?

115
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,094
Who are you?

116
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,762
He's my boyfriend.

117
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,267
What?

118
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,122
You know what?
We should stay together all day.

119
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,957
Don't go overboard.

120
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,375
How did you know I was here?

121
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,252
I'm your boyfriend.

122
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,255
I will go and find you,
no matter where you are.

123
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,133
Really? You're amazing.

124
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,468
Study.

125
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,396
What's this?

126
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,817
"Do you have a boyfriend?
You're a goddess."

127
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,781
"Can we meet if you have time? 010-53…"

128
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,920
What's this? A poem?

129
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,589
"Kang Ha-young, you're my black hole.

130
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,508
You make me fall for you.

131
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,510
I will love you forever"?

132
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,471
He must be crazy.
How dare he? Who is this?

133
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,600
Hey, look at me, poet.
Who wrote this poem?

134
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,143
I'll throw them all out.

135
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,939
Forget it. I'll go home.

136
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,100
We're done.

137
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,269
Great. Thank you.

138
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,228
Thank you.

139
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,692
Let's go straight to Seongsu-dong.
You have a commercial shoot soon.

140
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,152
Okay. Let's go.

141
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,695
Sorry about the tight schedule.

142
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,239
You have to finish everything
before the season starts.

143
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,824
I know. Don't worry.

144
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,287
Hi, Dae-sung. I'm a huge fan.
May I have your autograph?

145
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,788
Sure. What's your name?

146
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,206
-It's Ji-hye.
-Ji-hye?

147
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,961
DECEMBER 2012, WINTER OF TWENTY-THREE

148
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,767
<i>WAITING FOR YOU ON A WINDY DAY</i>

149
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,690
Read.

150
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,410
Jin-hwan, don't you have
any classes today?

151
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,203
I only called Ha-young.

152
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,373
I don't. We're a couple, anyway.

153
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,624
Heon!

154
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,376
Oh, hi.

155
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,254
You and your girlfriend are famous now.
Look at this.

156
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,091
See you. Let's go.

157
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,218
Bye.

158
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,348
Sol-i. You should've told us about this.

159
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,392
How could you do the photoshoot
without us?

160
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,519
I'm so disappointed.

161
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:35,106
Jin-hwan, you don't even attend
Hankuk University.

162
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,651
I practically do because my girlfriend
and my friends go there.

163
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,947
Heon, you look great in this picture.

164
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,033
Right?

165
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:45,992
Sol-i.

166
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,326
Yes?

167
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,120
You knew, didn't you?

168
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,414
Yes.

169
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,335
Actually, a reporter
from the school newspaper contacted me

170
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,214
and said he'd give me this.

171
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,676
I'm sorry. Are you angry?

172
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,765
He said we looked so good together,
so he took the photo without realizing it.

173
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,397
Take us with you.

174
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,317
It's just for two people.

175
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,196
You disloyal jerk.
When did you become a romantic?

176
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,655
You're so ungrateful.

177
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,241
Yes, we'll go on our own.
Get lost, Jin-hwan.

178
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,036
Ha-young, look at them.

179
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,329
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

180
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,081
CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER

181
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,216
Mr. Jeong Jin-hwan, please come in.

182
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,551
Yes.

183
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,483
Are you really okay?

184
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,318
Of course.

185
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,529
Aren't you going to tell Ha-young?

186
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,743
No, I won't.

187
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,662
That means

188
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,872
you should keep this a secret.

189
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,897
Why did you call me?

190
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,983
I was focusing on my studies.

191
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,700
I'm really busy because the first draft
of my master's thesis is due today.

192
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,745
Is something wrong?

193
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,100
Let's break up.

194
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:18,853
What?

195
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,231
We've been going out for too long.
We're getting sick of each other.

196
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,821
Jin-hwan, are you kidding me?

197
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:31,824
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,871
This isn't funny at all.
What the hell are you doing?

199
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,707
You said you were busy. You should go now.

200
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,626
I'll get going.

201
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,214
Hey!

202
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,226
-Heon, you're here.
-Hi.

203
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,563
Why do you have so much in your bag?
Isn't it heavy?

204
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,857
-No.
-Do you want me to carry it?

205
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,817
No, it's okay.

206
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,572
When did you get here?
Why didn't you call me?

207
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,408
He's really handsome.

208
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,701
Is she his girlfriend?

209
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,995
-He's way too good for her.
-I agree.

210
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,998
Don't listen to them.

211
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,379
I didn't hear anything.

212
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,423
I have something to tell you.

213
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,591
What is it?

214
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,052
Jin-hwan will go into surgery.

215
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:34,887
What?

216
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,889
He told me not to tell Ha-young.

217
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,017
But the surgery's quite risky,
so I think we should tell her.

218
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,978
No wonder.

219
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,188
Ha-young is really shocked

220
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,440
because Jin-hwan suddenly
broke up with her.

221
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,151
You should talk to her
so that she doesn't get upset.

222
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,946
Okay, I will. Don't worry.

223
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,364
Good.

224
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,162
THE 100 GREATEST SPORTSMEN

225
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,999
Dae-sung is on a roll!

226
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,667
He took first place again.

227
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,087
I heard he's famous abroad, too.
He's a superstar now.

228
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,756
Did you guys see his automobile advert?

229
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,594
He looked so cool
with the convertible car.

230
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,522
Mr. Jeong Jin-hwan,
prepare for your surgery in 30 minutes.

231
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,620
Jin-hwan.

232
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,793
Ha-young.

233
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,213
Are you stupid? Did you think
I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me?

234
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,300
I was sorry.

235
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,055
-So…
-Don't be sorry.

236
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,349
It's okay as long as you survive.

237
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,653
I'll be waiting. See you after surgery.

238
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,617
Okay.

239
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,744
Okay.

240
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,397
JUNE 2014, SUMMER OF TWENTY-FIVE

241
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,052
Okay. Who's next?

242
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:24,140
-Me!
-Me!

243
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,057
-Me!
-Hey.

244
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,102
I've been looking for you.

245
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,272
It's a scary lady. Run away!

246
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,235
Go back!

247
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,239
Goodness.

248
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,913
Take my love.

249
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,081
No, thanks.

250
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,257
JULY 2015, SUMMER OF TWENTY-SIX

251
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,776
Heon!

252
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,533
Heon, shouldn't you be at the hospital?

253
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,911
I came here to see you.

254
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,162
Aren't you tired?

255
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,123
Part-time jobs are always hard.

256
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,000
Here.

257
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,960
Thanks.

258
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,589
Sit down. I'll do it.

259
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,257
Really?

260
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,220
Thank you.

261
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,812
Thank you.

262
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,861
-He's so cute.
-Thank you.

263
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,446
-I'd like one, too.
-Thank you.

264
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,323
-He's so handsome.
-Thank you.

265
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,493
-Thank you.
-You're so good-looking.

266
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,036
-Me, too.
-Thank you.

267
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,830
-Give me one more, please.
-Thank you.

268
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,083
-Thank you.
-Let's ask for one.

269
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,627
-Give me one, please.
-Thank you.

270
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,753
-Me, too.
-Thank you.

271
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,421
You'll get sunburned. Put this on.

272
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,132
It's hot.

273
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,843
I know. Just put it on.

274
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,719
Why?

275
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,304
Just put it on!
