is Qian Ren Xue.

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
As long as you come
from the Martial Soul Hall,

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,300
you are my enemy!

Tan San.

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,010
Goodbye.

41
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,030
Who is it?

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,460
Senior Du Gu,

43
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,200
you're finally here!

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,600
I've been with Father all this time,

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,130
in case my brother hurts him again.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,260
The poison has taken effect.

47
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,730
At most, he can last for half an hour.

48
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,330
He is severely intoxicated.

49
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,400
The medication I have with me

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
isn't effective for that.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,460
It's a mixed poison made up
of seven different poisons.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,430
No wonder even I couldn't find the antidote.

53
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,760
I can make the antidote,

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,160
but I need time.

Old Freak.

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,400
How long can he live

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,660
if we fight poison with poison?

58
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,600
At least twenty-four hours.

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,030
But if we still can't rescue him,

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
he will die for sure.

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,900
Let's start.

How is the school?

64
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,100
Once we defeated the enemy,

65
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,900
we immediately came here to meet you,

66
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,260
and saw people from the Qibao Amber tribe

67
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,300
and Tang's clan

68
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,900
fighting with the imperial soul masters.

69
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,200
We snuck in under the cover of the chaos.

70
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,930
The power of Tang's clan

71
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,060
is what the Martial Soul Hall overlooked.

72
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,700
Let's go back to the school first.

73
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,200
We can only start our counterattack

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
after we get the support of Emperor Xue Ye.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,760
The palace is heavily guarded.

76

the Qibao Amber tribe and Tang's clan

78

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,980
