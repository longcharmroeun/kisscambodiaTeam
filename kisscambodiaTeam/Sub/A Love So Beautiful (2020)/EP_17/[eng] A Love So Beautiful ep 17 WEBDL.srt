NOVEMBER 2008, DAY OF CSAT EXAM

3
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,250
There she is.

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,584
-How did you do?
-Over here!

5
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,795
-You must be exhausted.
-Actually, I'm good.

6
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,130
-Good job.
-Did you do well?

7
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,298
Yeon-hae, over here!

8
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,175
<i>Heon, did you wait long?</i>

9
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,011
-Not really.
-Did you do well on your test?

10
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,224
I don't know. What about you?

11
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,392
Me?

12
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,978
I'm just thrilled that it's over.

13
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,188
Let's have some fun!

14
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,297
-Did you do well on your test?
-What?

15
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,841
I guess.

16
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,065
-Aren't you coming?
-What?

17
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,402
I'm coming.

18
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,834
Well, the CSAT is finally over.

19
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,545
We'll be 20 years old soon.

20
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,799
When will I get myself a girlfriend?

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,679
As if I stand a chance.

22
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,349
Why do you say that?

23
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,477
Because I'm…

24
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,356
You know how I am.

25
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,192
You can say…

26
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,986
you have a girlfriend now.

27
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,740
What do you mean?

28
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,992
Tell everyone you have a girlfriend now.

29
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,917
Tell them that I'm your girlfriend.

30
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,754
Really? Are you sure?

31
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,676
I finally have a girlfriend!

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,554
-Kang Ha-young is my girlfriend!
-Jin-hwan!

33
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,474
Sorry.

34
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,102
Are you going to take it back?

35
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,938
No, that's not it.

36
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,482
Don't jump around.

37
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,610
What if you hurt yourself?

38
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,450
Wait for me!

39
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,495
My girlfriend.

40
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,038
Ha-young!

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,213
What fine weather we have.

42
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,882
You think?

43
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,804

-Good job.

48
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,900
-What is it?
-Sol-i.

49
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,193
-What's wrong?
-Kang Sang-hun.

50
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,570
I got…

51
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,781
Compared to all the mock exams I took…

52
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,286
-Ha Dae-yun.
-This is my highest score yet.

53
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,372
-Lee Ji-won.
-Yes.

54
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,958
No way. Sol-i, congratulations!

55
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,295
-Could this be a system error?
-Kim Seong-jae.

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,132
-Heon.
-Thank you.

57
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,593
-Kang Ji-yeon.
-Yes.

58
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,723
-Good job.
-I can't believe it.

59
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,062
What?

60
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,608
How's yours? Is it good?

61
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,239
It's sweet.

62
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,784
I see.

63
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,670
It's too sweet. You can have it.

64
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,839
Are you sure? Nice!

65
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,680
No way.

66
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,519
Heon, we just kissed.

67
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,664
By the way, when will you write it?

68
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,457
-Write what?
-The relay letter.

69
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,668
You're the only one
who hasn't written in it.

70
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,632
Are you done?

71
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,263
When will you write it?

72
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,648
That's only for those
who will be parting ways.

73
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,240
Heon, wait for me!

74
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,075
HANKUK UNIVERSITY ADMISSION RESULT

75
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,254
YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED
TO HANKUK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL SCHOOL

76
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:24,050
Heon, you got in. Mom, he was accepted!

77
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,845
Good job.

78
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,702
SHIN SOL-I

79
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,087
<i>The person you called cannot be reached…</i>

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,016
Ta-da!

81
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,101
Ta-da! I got in as well.

82
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,146
I'll visit you often on campus.

83
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,814
Heon was also accepted there.

84
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,193
What about Sol-i?
She's not answering my calls.

85
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,403
Right. She hasn't replied
to my texts either.

86
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,082
Sol-i, are you all right?

87
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm the only one who didn't get in.

88
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,421
It's all right. Don't be too upset.

89
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,132
Your mom and I weren't
the smartest in school either.

90
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,135
University isn't everything.

91
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,429
You can take over
one of our pork trotter places.

92
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,639
How does CEO Shin sound?

93
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,349
We're opening another branch store.

94
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,062
And get her accused of nepotism?
She can't start off as a CEO.

95
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,357
-A manager sounds better.
-Right, I guess that can be an issue.

96
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,944
Then why not have her
as the manager of our Mapo branch?

97
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,363
That sounds great.

98
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,782
You've got to be kidding me!

99
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,624
Hi, Heon. What brings you by?

100
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,418
Sol-i's not answering her phone.

101
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,408
Everyone got in, but not me.

102
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,869
What do I do?

103
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,079
Isn't it obvious?

104
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,665
Take the test again.

105
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,002
Next year?

106
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,881
As if that's easy, you jerk.

107
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,592
I'll help.

108
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,928
-How?
-Study for art university.

109
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,975
-Art university?
-You like art.

110
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,729
Would I be able to do it?

111
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,356
Shin Sol-i,

112
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,610
do you know what my CSAT score is?

113
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,947
I do. Are you bragging?

114
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,159
You colossal jerk!

115
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,922
That's why I can help you.

116
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,175
What?

117
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,052
Let me tutor you.

118
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,805
Take the CSAT next year
and get into my university.

119
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,556
Your university?

120
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,142
-It has an art program.
-Really?

121
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,852
Besides, medical school lasts six years.

122
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,730
We can still graduate together.

123
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,399
What if I never get to graduate?

124
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,235
I hear it's not that easy.

125
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,739
You're worrying before even getting in?

126
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,034
Yes. I'd be able to get in
with your help anyway.

127
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,787
Think about getting in first.

128
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,707
Got it. So what should I start with?

129
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,211
Art school requires a performance test.

130
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,324
Will you be all right?

131
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,202
Take it easy on the preliminaries.

132
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,663
Don't worry.

133
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,457
I'm going to win the finals too.

134
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,003
Don't overwork yourself.

135
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,392

00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,438
Hey, Dae-sung.

137
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,609
The final round starts soon. Wish me luck.

138
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,362
Of course. You've got this.
You'll win for sure.

139
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,367
Thanks. I feel confident now.

140
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,996
So, how did it go for you?

141
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,959
I'm retaking the CSAT next year.
You'll root for me too, right?

142
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,462
Of course, I will.

143
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,423
Thanks. We'll both do well. Good luck.

144
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,091
Okay. Good luck.

<i>He and Gu Hwan-su are neck and neck.
Come on, Woo.</i>

149
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,407
<i>Woo Dae-sung has taken the lead.</i>

150
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,452
<i>Woo Dae-sung is the first
to make his flip turn.</i>

151
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,955
<i>He now picks up his final pace.</i>

152
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,666
<i>Who will win the gold medal today?</i>

153
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,167
<i>It is still up for grabs.</i>

154
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,543
<i>Only 15m remains.</i>

155
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,253
<i>Will it be Woo Dae-sung?</i>

156
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,881
<i>Woo Dae-sung touches the finish line.</i>

157

-<i>Korea wins a gold medal again.</i>
-Nice!

161
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,141
Dad, he won the gold medal!

162
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,560
He did it!

163
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,188
Dae-sung!

164
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,940
Dae-sung,

165
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,776
despite suffering a slump
from your shoulder injury,

166
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,277
you won the gold medal.

167
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,612
Can you give us a comment?

168
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,033
I mustered up the courage
and decided to start over.

169
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,620
As it turns out, it could be done.

170
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,958
That is why I'd like to tell my friend
to hang in there as well.

171

WOO DAE-SUNG

Good luck on retaking the CSAT!

174
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,052
Sol-i, he just mentioned you.

175
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,513
My daughter was mentioned on TV!

176
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,682
Dad, I'm doomed.

177
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,853
-Why?
-The whole nation knows now.

178
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,775

00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,497
GRADUATION

181
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,166
DIPLOMA

182
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,671
I'm graduating high school for real.

183
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,280
JUNE 2009, SUMMER OF TWENTY

184
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,047
I don't know if you've heard this,

185
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
but there's a myth that eating the prop

186
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,177
will prevent you
from getting into university.

187
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,305
-Really?
-No way. That's a lie.

188
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,435
When the iliopsoas contracts,

189
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,688
they pull the spine toward them.

190
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,899
As the spine is pulled forward,

191
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,487
pressure is applied, causing back pain…

192
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,956
Who's there?

193
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,835
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,004
-You should have told me in advance.
-I'll get going.

195
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,799
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,189
Hello?

197
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,568
What's up?

198
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,904
What? You're the one who called me.

199
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,364
Did you dial the wrong number?

200
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,617
I'll hang up then. I'm busy studying.

201
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,535
Okay.

202
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,714
SHIN SOL-I
CALL ENDED

203
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,717
DECEMBER 2009, WINTER OF TWENTY

204
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,636
Sol-i, we're here to see you.

205
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,013
How are you doing?

206
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,557
Jin-hwan! Ha-young!

207
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,309
Ha-young's mine.

208
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,901
Heon!

209
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,447
When did you last wash your hair?

210
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,367
Yesterday?

211
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,287
The day before that?

212
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,623
What brings you all here?

213
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,999
We came to wish you luck.

214
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,336
-Tomorrow's your test day.
-Let our energy give you strength.

215
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,088
I'm here too!

216
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,591
Dae-sung!

217
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,395
Seriously? After the hours
it took for me to fly here?

218
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,815
You can't treat me this way.

219
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,320
I guess I have no choice then.
I should just head back.

220
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,205
Seriously? You won't stop me from going?

221
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,249
You especially, Jin-hwan.

222
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,127
Sol-i, you've got this, right?

223
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,046
You'll get accepted this year.

224
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,714
Good luck, Sol-i!

225
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,341
I'm sure you'll do well.

226
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,391
Please.

227
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,818
YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED…

228
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,069
-Honey!
-What?

229
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,737
-Sol-i!
-"Accepted"!

230
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,906
-I got in!
-Yes!

231
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,075
-I can't believe it.
-I'm so proud of you.

232
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,785
You did it!

233
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,036
Cheers.

234
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,705
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

235
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,503
Who knew that this day would come?

236
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,256
Shin Sol-i was accepted
into Hankuk University?

237
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,010
-Sol-i, congratulations on making it in.
-Yes, congratulations.

238
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,761
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

239
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,931
Thank you so much, guys.

240
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,518
All right. Let's be the college students
that we are and party all night.

241
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,769
Cheers!

242
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,187
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

243
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,774
Mi-nyeo.

244
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,154
For some reason,
you seem exceptionally pretty today.

245
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,698
I've always been pretty.

246
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,995
My mom calls me a lottery ticket
that hasn't been scratched off yet.

247
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,834
Can I be the one to give it a try?

248
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,836
My gosh!

249
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,009
You two. Make sure
to head home separately tonight.

250
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,053
All right?

251
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,267
Ha-young, let's go.

252
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,729
I'm not drunk.

253
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
Of course. I'm fully aware of that.

254
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,609
Hold on.

255
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,527
All right.

256
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,204
Sol-i.

257
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,831
Sol-i, are you all right?

258
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,797
Cha Heon, you prick.

259
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,385
What?

260
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,184
Let's go.

00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,499
Heon, watch me walk in a straight line.

263
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,543
Walking like a model.

264
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,760
Thanks, Heon.

265
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,637
For what?

266
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,016
I was able to get into university
thanks to you.

267
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,561
Heon.

268
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,021
You know…

269
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,403
that I like you a lot, right?

270
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,075
I've liked you since…

271
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,663
-Since…
-Sol-i.

272
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,707
Yes?

273
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,127
Would you be able to remember

274
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,546
what happened tonight?

275
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,798
Yes!

Heon, did you really just
call me your girlfriend?

278
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,401
-Take us with you.
-It's just for two people.

279
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,071
<i>You disloyal jerk.
When did you become a romantic?</i>

280
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,365
<i>Hi, Dae-sung. I'm a huge fan.</i>

281

<i>Dae-sung is on a roll!</i>

00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,920
Don't go back to your dorm tonight.
