00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,310
Little Freak.

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,380
What should we do?

34
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,180
We'll have to barge in by force.

35
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,010
Let's go.

36
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,810
Kill!

37
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,680
One wrong move

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,010
and we lost everything.

[Episode 156]

40
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,080
Chief.

41
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,280
Thank you for your hard work, elders.

42
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,280
How many people did we lose?

43
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,050
Nobody was seriously injured.

44
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,050
Old Rhino and everyone
in the Hall of Defense

45
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,050
are all strong and fierce

46
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,050
that they blocked the front like a wall.

47
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,180
Chief Tang.

48
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,910
Thank you for your help

49
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,610
so we could evacuate safely.

50
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,610
How is His Majesty?

51
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,610
Very bad.

52
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,210
We need to find an antidote quickly

53
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,210
and stabilize the situation
of Tian Dou Empire.

54
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,280
Xue Qing He is a fake?

55
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
That woman is very decisive

56
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
and powerful.

57
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,750
This time,

58
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,210
if it wasn't for
the Century Millennium Soul Ring

59
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,610
that Wu gave me,

60
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,680
I would've been defeated

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,050
by her Six-winged Angel Martial Soul.

62
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,410
But...

63
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,810
when I taught her,

64
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,710
what she had was the royal family's
Swan Martial Soul.

65
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,650
Could it be that she also has Twin Martial Souls?

66
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,580
Bibi Dong mentioned before

67
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,410
that the Martial Soul Hall
has six Century Millenium Soul Bones

68
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,410
which have been passed down for a thousand years.

69
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,750
I'm guessing

70
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,910
that Qian Ren Xue has at least one piece.

71
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,110
It's likely that this piece

72
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,110
gives her the Disguise Skill.

73
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,110
There's a skill like that?

74
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,510
I've never heard of it before.

75
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,880
With only one piece

76
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,350
can she be so powerful.

77
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,480
If she had all six...

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,710
When all six soul bones are used at once,

79
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,350
they will create a type of soul bone armor

80
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,450
like you had last time,

81
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,450
called Angel's Armor.

82
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,080
Its amplification power

83
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,850
is beyond what you can imagine.

84
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,780
It really is

85
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,180
a godly item.

86
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,180
Qian Ren Xue is extremely gifted

87
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,480
and talented at learning.

88
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,310
If she has all six soul bones

89
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,710
and assists Bibi Dong,

90
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,010
then wouldn't we...?!

91
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,610
There are extremely high requirements

92
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,280
for a soul master to use all six soul bones.

93
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,750
First, they must have
the Six-winged Angel Martial Soul.

94
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,650
Next,

95
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,810
they must be extremely gifted.

96
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,950
Rumor says

97
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,110
that when you absorb the last soul bone,

98
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,250
your soul power

99
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,950
must be at level 100.

100
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,410
100?

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,850
In the history of soul masters,

102
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,980
that is just a legend.

103
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,780
Once your soul power reaches level 90,

104
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,510
every one level up is extremely difficult.

105
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,910
It's extremely hard after level 95.

106
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,810
I wonder how the ascension from level 99

107
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,980
to level 100 is like.

108
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,780
Xue Ye is extremely intoxicated

109
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,480
and will surely die.

110
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,050
As long as we announce
to the public that the emperor is dead

111
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,480
and blame his death on Xue Beng,

112
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,680
it's not too late to teach them a lesson

113
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,010
after Young Master ascends the throne.

114
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,550
You underestimate Tang San.

115
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,110
He and Du Gu Bo
taking Xue Ye with them

116
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,110
means that they have the confidence to heal him.

117
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,450
Send my orders.

118
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,750
Assemble all the Martial Soul Hall's troops,

119
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,480
and destroy the power

120
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,810
of the Tian Dou royal family to the last bit.

121
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,810
My lord.

122
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,080
You have lurked in the palace for 20 years.

123
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,280
Are you going to...

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,410
We cannot hesitate,

125
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,110
or else things will get worse.

126
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,110
Once we're done,

127
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,980
we will leave Tian Dou City immediately.

128
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,550
There will be opportunities in the future.

129
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,510
Chief.

130
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,650
I have already detoxified all the poison

131
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,650
inside Emperor Xue Ye.

132
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,380
But

133
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,510
he was intoxicated for too long,

134
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,010
so his organs

135
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,010
are badly damaged.

136
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,210
He can only live
for another two to five years.

137
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,210
Does His Majesty

138
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,280
know about this?

139
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,650
I didn't tell him.

140
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,850
He is asleep.

141
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,850
With the help of my medicine,

142
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,280
I assume he will recover by tomorrow.

143
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,210
Elder,

144
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,980
Old Freak.

145
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,150
Thank you both.

146
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,380
Please get some rest.

147
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,680
Chief Tang.

148
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,310
What should we do now?

149
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,310
I guess

150
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,480
that Qian Ren Xue

151
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,410
won't fight us with force.

152
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,910
Her best choice

153
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,910
is to find a way
to assassinate the emperor

154
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,580
and ascend the throne.

155
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,450
But she has to face the threat

156
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,010
of our 5,000 soul masters.

157
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,010
Then

158
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,450
are there any other possibilities?

159
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,210
Destruction.

160
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,180
Destroy Tian Dou City as much as she can,

161
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,880
especially the palace.

162
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,110
If Tian Dou Empire's power is severely undermined,

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,750
the Martial Soul Hall

164
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,410
will have much more chances later on.

165
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,050
Oh, no!

166
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,050
We're too late.

167
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,110
Angel feather.

168
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,050
It was her.

169
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,350
She used the soul masters
of the royal family of Tian Dou Empire

170
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,350
and killed them all when she'd been done with them.

171
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,610
You really are cruel, Qian Ren Xue.

172
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,610
(Tang San.)

173
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,480
(You won this time.)

174
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,680
(But we will meet again.)

175
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,750
A defeat is a defeat.

176
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,510
We can start everything over.

177
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,010
Given the circumstances,

178
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,010
we still have a major advantage.

179
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,050
I didn't lose to Tang San,

180
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,050
but you.

181
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,550
If you hadn't rushed things,

182
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,650
I wouldn't have taken a risk
and started attacking early.

183
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,150
Sis...

184
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,050
Sis...

185
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,610
Sister?

186
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,350
No.

187
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,350
I should still call you Your Holiness.

188
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,880
In this world,

189
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,180
I only have one relative,

190
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,780
my grandfather.

191
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,550
From now on,

192
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,410
you rule the Martial Soul Hall,

193
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,610
and I will rule the Elder Hall
and the Dou Luo Hall.

194
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,210
You won't have the right to give orders

195
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,880
to any elder of the Elder Hall.

196
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,110
What did you say?

197
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,050
Go see your grandfather.

198
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,780
If he agrees with you,

199
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,780
I will, too.

200

[Soul Land]

201
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,580
San.

202
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,850
Any plans for the coming days?

203
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,580
I'm going to go back
to the Hao Tian tribe first

204
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,450
and tell them what happened.

205
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,010
I will also bring the God of Ironsmith, Lou Gao,

206
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,180
to the Hao Tian bribe

207
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,580
and ask my uncle to help him

208
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,250
create powerful hidden weapons.

209
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,250
And then?

210
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,510
After the battle with Qian Ren Xue,

211
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,310
I've discovered many of my weak points.

212
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,450
I want to stay and train
in the Hao Tian tribe

213
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,780
to increase the attack power

214
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,710
of the Hao Tian Hammer.

215
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,710
You should go back to the Hao Tian tribe.

216
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,780
But I don't think you should train there.

217
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,110
Teacher.

218
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,050
Do you have any suggestions?

219
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:44,750
I will listen to you.

220
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,080
I do.

221
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,580
It's just that

222
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,050
I don't want you to take any risks.

223
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,180
Teacher.

224
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,680
You taught me before

225
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,380
that the higher the pressure,

226
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,550
the easier it is to bring out

227
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,450
your potential.

228
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,210
If I don't improve my skills sooner,

229
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,050
how will we

230
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,850
face the Martial Soul Hall in the future?

231
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,410
I knew you would say that.

232
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,410
Fine.

233
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,110
Then I will tell you.

234
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,280
My suggestion

235
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,810
is for you to go to an extremely dangerous place

236
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,810
where you can quickly improve your skills.

237
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,810
Where is it?

238
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,310
That place

239
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,010
is called Haishen Island.

240
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,650
It's an island full of soul beasts.

241
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,010
If you can pass the challenges
and successfully return,

242
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,950
then

243
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,250
all aspects of your skills

244
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,050
will improve greatly.

245
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,950
That place is quite challenging
despite the many chances to improve.

246
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,780
Has anyone been there before?

247
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,750
The Martial Soul Hall once sent
2,000 soul masters

248
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,280
to that island

249
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,150
in order to recruit the soul masters there.

250
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,010
But

251
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,410
not only did they fail completely,

252
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,350
they also lost two Grand Soul Land Masters.

253
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,350
After that,

254
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,510
the Martial Soul Hall never tried again.

255
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,180
This...

256
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,150
Grandfather.

257
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
You went to see her?

258
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,110
Actually,

259
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,110
she is also very pained.

260
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,550
After all,

261
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,810
she is not the one to be blamed.

262
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,810
Her feelings toward you

263
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,180
are different from what you imagine.

264
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,180
Grandfather.

265
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,180
Are you not going to help me either?

266
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,180
I can't.

267
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,380
Even though she's a bit radical,

268
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,380
she didn't do anything wrong.

269
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,610
She is still the pope of the Martial Soul Hall.

270
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,610
Besides,

271
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,610
her influence

272
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,610
in the Martial Soul Hall

273
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,410
surpasses mine.

274
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,480
What?

275
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,550
That...

276
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,780
That's impossible.

277
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,780
Xue.

278
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,510
You must never forget.

279
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,710
This world is about the survival of the fittest.

280
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,880
Those who are stronger

281
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
have a bigger say in matters.

282
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,680
She will bring the Martial Soul Hall
to new heights.

283
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,510
You need

284
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,180
to help her.

285
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,180
No matter what,

286
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,950
she is still your mother.

287
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,650
Grandfather.

288
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,350
I want to ask you for one last favor.

289
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,250
I want to be the Judicial Elder
of the Martial Soul Hall.

290
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,750
The Judicial Elder cannot participate
in any Martial Soul Hall missions

291
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,050
and must kill

292
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,980
all the top opponents of the Hall.

293
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,310
Have you considered it carefully?

294
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,280
Because of the young person
that defeated you this time?

295
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,410
From now on,

296
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,880
I won't meddle in the affairs
of the Martial Soul Hall.

297
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,880
