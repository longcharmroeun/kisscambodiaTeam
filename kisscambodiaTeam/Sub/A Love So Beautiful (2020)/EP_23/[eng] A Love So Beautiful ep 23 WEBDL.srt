55
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,980
Are you asking me to marry you?

56
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,190
Yes.

57
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,329
Ta-da.

58
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,796
Sol-i.

59
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,843
My life has no meaning without you

60
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,597
because I'm nothing without you.

61
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,682
So…

62
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,019

67
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,409
Did Jin-hwan coach you?

68
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,580
No.

69
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,801
Will you marry me?

70
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,025
Sure.

-Congratulations.

77
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,259
Congratulations!

78
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,056
Thanks, Heon.

79
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,019
-Congratulations.
-Be happy!

80
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,939
-Congratulations!
-I envy you!

81
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,777
Heon, look at this. Isn't it stunning?

82
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,904
I bought that ring for you.

83
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,282
That's why it's more beautiful.

84
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,160
It's sparkling. So pretty.

85
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,833
Heon.

86
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,252
Let me pinch my cheek.

87
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,714
That really hurts.

88
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,179
Sol-i, you're not a puppy.

89
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,098
Sorry.

90
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,396
Heon, wait for me. I won't bite you again!

91
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,567
Heon, get back here.

92
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,360
Don't.

93
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,821
Give me a hug.

94
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,001
Go home now.

95
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,713
Tomorrow's my day off.

96
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,766
-What are you doing?
-Taking a nap.

97
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,458
MOM

98
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,757
-Mom?
-<i>Shin Sol-i!</i>

99
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,425
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

100
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,261
Mom, I must have fallen asleep.

101
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,304
What's the matter?

102
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,682
Do you remember Jin-su whom I mentioned?

103
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,437
-Who?
-<i>My friend's son. Sun-nam's son.</i>

104
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:09,109
-I turned down that blind date, Mom.
-<i>Don't be shy.</i>

105
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,693
I got a look at him.

106
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,531
He's really tall and quite handsome.

107
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,201
<i>Also, he's a general manager
at a big company.</i>

108
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,162
<i>Sun-nam and I checked your compatibility</i>

109
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,207
and you guys are a match made in heaven.

110
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,335
Why did you check that already?
I said I'm not interested!

111
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,798
Hi, Ms. Lee. This is Cha Heon.

112
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,633
What? Heon?

113
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,385
Yes, Sol-i and I got back together.

114
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,848
I'll pay a visit soon
and greet you properly.

115
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,062
Here. She has something to say.

116
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,487
Yes, Mom.

117
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,825
Hey, Sol-i! You just said you were asleep.

118
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,453
Mom, I think
my phone's running out of battery.

119
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,998
I can't hear you. Can you hear me?

120
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,499
I can't hear you.

121
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,798
You should go home now.

122
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,781
What's that sound?

123
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,408
Upstairs.

124
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,036
A newlywed couple moved in recently.

125
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,789
Got it. Good night.

126
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,708
Heon.

127
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,586
I can't sleep.

128
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,096
Close your eyes.

129
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,640
I'll be here with you
until you fall asleep.

130
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,754
Heon.

131
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,551
I was touched by your proposal today.

132
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,223
I guess you really like me, though,

133
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,684
seeing that you proposed to me.

134
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,737
Sol-i.

135
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,488
Yes?

136
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,701
Why do you always forget that I love you?

137
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,002
I love you.

138
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,756
I love you too.

139
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,324
Wake up. Have some breakfast.

140
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,454
I want to sleep some more. I'm tired.

141
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,540
You slept enough.

142
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,585
I was exhausted last night.

143
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,222
-Heon.
-Yes?

144
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,432
You're blushing.

145
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,602
You too.

146
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,525
Last night, you…

147
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,474
Hold on.

148
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,435
Is that the delivery man?

149
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,441
<i>Sol-i, it's me. Open the door!</i>

150
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,401
<i>Hey! Open the door!</i>

151
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,153
-I'm doomed. Darn it.
-<i>It's your dad.</i>

152
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,738
-What's going on?
-<i>Goodness.</i>

153
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,866
-<i>What is she up to?</i>
-Heon, hide!

154
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,286
<i>-Sol-i!
-Hey, Sol-i.</i>

155
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,965
Sol-i, I never thought

156
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,719
you'd be home with Heon today as well.

157
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,222
Oh, he left after the call last night,

158
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,434
but he came back this morning.

159
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,770
Oh, is that so?

160
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:20,855
Yes.

161
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,820
I hear you and Sol-i are back together.

162
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:29,906
Yes, sir.

163
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,784
Do you drink?

164
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,745
Let me pour you a glass.

165
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,789
-Sure.
-Thank you, Mr. Shin.

166
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:40,875
-You're welcome--
-Honey!

167
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,087
-Let me pour you a glass too.
-Sure.

168
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,466
Thanks.

169
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,135
All right. Let's drink.

170
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,144
-Father.
-Yes?

171
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,773
-Please marry me.
-All right.

172
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,108
When should we have the wedding?

173
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,445
What are you talking about?
Come back to your senses, both of you!

174
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,530
You'll marry each other?

175
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,618
Instead of saying,
"Father, please marry me,"

176
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,954
you should say
"I'd like to marry your daughter."

177
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,249
Honey, are you all right?

178
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,001
Honey, I'm not drunk.

179
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,629
Sol-i, I'm perfectly fine.

180
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,257
All you can manage
is half a bottle of soju.

181
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,384
Why would you test how much he can drink?

182
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,511
