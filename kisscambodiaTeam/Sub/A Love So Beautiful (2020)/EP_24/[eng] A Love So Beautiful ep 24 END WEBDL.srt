00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,733
<i>Sol-i.</i>

3
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,528
I think our relationship began

4
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,322
around that time.

5
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:19,663
YUIL HIGH SCHOOL WELCOMES
THE NEW CLASS OF 2006

6
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,750
Heon. The thing is…

7
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,794
What is it?

8
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,257
I like you.

9
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,343
I don't like you.

10
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,312
Then, I'll figure out a way.

11
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,745
<i>You always followed me around
with your short legs.</i>

12
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,924
<i>So I started wondering</i>

13
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,304
<i>if you could follow me every time.</i>

14
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,731
<i>So I tried going faster.</i>

15
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,239
<i>And you caught up with me</i>

16
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,783
<i>at an unexpected moment.</i>

17
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>Before I knew it,</i>

18
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:53,173
<i>I started to wait for you and observe you.</i>

19
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,677
<i>Then suddenly I realized</i>

20
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,472
<i>that you always got yourself in trouble.</i>

21
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,976
Why are you fooling around
when you're supposed to study?

22
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,061
Stand up.

23
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,439
What the hell is this?

24
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,484
"Which makes me want you even more.

25
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,196
-Give--"
-<i>Give me your love</i>

26
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,032
<i>Don't bring tears to my eyes</i>

27
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,119
<i>These words</i>

28
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:26,832
<i>Can be said more easily than breathing</i>

29
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,210
<i>-Yet I can't say them confidently
-Yet I can't say them confidently</i>

30
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,630
<i>-All I do is hide
-All I do is hide</i>

31
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:39,636
<i>-Like a coward
-Like a coward</i>

32
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,684
Where did it go?

33
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:47,978
Try to think.

34
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,646
This is crazy.

35
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,692
I think it's in my Korean language
notebook.

36
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,821
<i>Because of you,</i>

37
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>I did something
that I would never try to do.</i>

38
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,086
Hey, what was that?

39
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,297
Nothing, sir.

40
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,678
Get it together, all right?

41
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,889
You guys are going to be seniors soon.

42
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,682
Got it?

43
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,393
Yes, sir.

44
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,111
<i>I wrote a letter of apology
for the first time in my life.</i>

45
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,908
"Abusing the authority as a teacher
and reading a personal letter of a student

46
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,411
was not only a violation
of the student's civil rights

47
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,996
but was also highly…"

48
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,458
This isn't how you write an apology.

49
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,418
You don't sound apologetic at all.

50
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,838
This is my specialty, so let me help you.

51
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,053
ON

52
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>I even stepped up to do something</i>

53
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,057
<i>no one asked me to do.</i>

54
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,393
"I said quietly,

55
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,855
'Rest in peace.

56
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,151
I love you, Mother.'"

57
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,949
<i>OUR HAPPY TIME</i>

58
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:24,908
"And…

59
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,327
he said,

60
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,705
<i>'Don't worry.'"</i>

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,671
<i>I couldn't believe myself either.</i>

62
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,868
<i>Then one day,</i>

63
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,751
<i>every single thing you did
started to bother me.</i>

64
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,593
Sol-i.

65
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,887
You're a total loser.

66
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,517
<i>So I said harsh things out of anger</i>

67
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,645
<i>and hurt your feelings.</i>

68
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,567
<i>I was too young back then,</i>

69
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,865
<i>so I put my pain before yours.</i>

70
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,043
<i>But when I found out
that you might transfer to another school,</i>

71
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,421
<i>I couldn't sleep a wink that night.</i>

72
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:23,401
<i>I was truly afraid
that you'd leave me for good.</i>

73
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,408
I'm here to pick up
the literature performance assessment.

74
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,202
Oh, right.

75
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,998
I think it's too heavy
for one person to carry, though.

76
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,723
Shin Sol-i.

77
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,185
Don't go.

78
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,619
<i>That was why</i>

79
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,163
<i>I approached you first.</i>

80
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:24,170
<i>I slowly began to realize
that you were really cute.</i>

81
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,924
Heon.

82
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,177
Can you plug your ears for a minute?

83
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,853
<i>As I looked at you,</i>

84
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,107
<i>I started smiling genuinely more often.</i>

85
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,194
I'm sorry. I was fixing my clothes.

86
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,992
<i>Before I knew it,</i>

87
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,578
<i>I was already looking after you.</i>

88
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,917
That sleeve turned wet.

89
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,236
Heon, you waited for me!

90
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,530
-Who said that?
-Come on.

91
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,407
Why don't you tell me honestly?

92
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,912
Shin Sol-i,
don't you have any self-respect?

93
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,081
No, I gave it all to you.

94
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,968
<i>So you and I became closer
than anyone else.</i>

95
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,888
Heon.

96
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,016
You know…

97
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,231
that I like you a lot, right?

98
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,565
Sol-i.

99
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,942
Yes?

100
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,779
Would you be able to remember

101
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,781
what happened tonight?

102
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,033
Yes!

103
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,439
<i>That's how we started dating.</i>

104
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,276
Go in.

105
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,741
-I'll go now.
-Okay.

106
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,544
Sol-i.

107
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,504
Yes?

108
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,480
Bye.

109
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,213
<i>At the time,</i>

110
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,133
<i>I was certain that I found</i>

111
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,844
<i>the answer to our relationship.</i>

112
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,530
Hurry up.

113
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,753
<i>I didn't realize that I was writing</i>

114
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,129
<i>the wrong answer.</i>

115
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,177
After a recovery period in the ICU,
if there are no issues,

116
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,555
he'll move to a general ward
for another week of recovery.

117
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,807
Good work.

118
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,019
Keep monitoring his ECG
after moving him to the general ward.

119
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,232
Do an additional echocardiography
and an enzyme test.

120
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
Yes, sir.

121
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,778
Who's doing the next surgery briefing?

122
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,238
SORRY, I CAN'T TAKE THE CALL RIGHT NOW

123
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,034
What brings you by unannounced?

124
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,330
<i>Until then,</i>

125
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,751
<i>I never imagined myself without you,
not even once.</i>

126
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,255
Let's break up.

127
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,757
What?

128
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,178
What are you…

129
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,433
You're going to the US.

130
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,312
Why didn't you tell me?

131
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,440
<i>Therefore,</i>

132
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,818
<i>your reaction felt so unfamiliar.</i>

133
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,321
<i>To be honest,</i>

134
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,450
<i>I thought I could make you stay.</i>

135
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,954
Are you Sol-i's boyfriend?

136
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,373
Could you tell Sol-i that I'm here?

137
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,960
<i>Sol-i packed up and moved out today.</i>

138
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,463
<i>Didn't you know?</i>

139
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,808
<i>Only then did I realize</i>

140
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,938
<i>that I underestimated our situation.</i>

141
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,408
Sol-i.

142
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,744
I'm leaving today.

143
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,040
<i>Will you</i>

144
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,460
come to see me?

145
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,589
Don't wait for me.

146
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,893
<i>Even so,</i>

147
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,230
<i>I was selfish to the end.</i>

148
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,026
<i>The three years in the States
I spent without you</i>

149
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,362
<i>went by very quickly.</i>

150
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,749
<i>There had never been a time
when I felt so uneasy</i>

151
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,210
<i>and so stifling in my life.</i>

152
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,517
Why are you always so uptight?

153
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,978
Are you going to stay?

154
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,699
What does a shoe put on to dress up?

155
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,911
A shoelace!

156
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,832
Isn't that funny?

157
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,587
Goodness.

158
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,927
<i>I was in terrible pain every single day.</i>

159
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,354
<i>And</i>

160
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,942
<i>when I met you again, I realized</i>

161
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,112
<i>that I never had</i>

162
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,866
<i>any other choice but you
in the first place.</i>

163
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,119
<i>I had to get you back</i>

164
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
because you're the right answer
to my life.

165
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,385
Sol-i.

166
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,666
<i>Sol-i. Now I know</i>

167
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,211
<i>that compared to my egostic self,</i>

168
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,506
<i>you're a really good person.</i>

169
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,316
<i>Not only do you accept me,</i>

170
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,569
<i>who is cold and indifferent,</i>

171
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,321
<i>but you also love me.</i>

172
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,075
Ta-da.

173
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,161
Will you marry me?

174
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,257
Sure.

175
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,759
But Sol-i,

176
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,429
you're not ordinary either,

177
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,308
<i>because you came back to me.</i>

178
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,767
Congratulations.

179
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,105
<i>I'm saying I'm very lucky…</i>

180
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,113
Heon, you're really drunk.

181
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,662
I'm not drunk at all.

182
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,922
Don't go.

183
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:03,559
<i>…because I'm back with you,
the one-of-a-kind Shin Sol-i.</i>

184
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,687
<i>I will</i>

185
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,024
<i>never let you go.</i>

186
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,444
Sol-i,

187
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,738
thank you so much

188
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:21,327
for staying by my side
since those beautiful days.

00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,351
NO THANKS.
I WON'T MARRY YOU

191
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,105
<i>There's a guy I like.</i>

192

<i>My dream</i>

193

<i>is to marry him.</i>

194
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,874
CHEERS TO OUR YOUTH THAT WERE, ARE,
AND WILL ALWAYS BE BEAUTIFUL

195
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,520
-One, two.
-Cut.

196
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,564
Let's start over.

197
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,649
I'll do it again. I'm sorry.

198
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,194
"Heon, you waited for me!"

199
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,196
One more time.

200
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,823
I danced and Sol-i…

201
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,241
-I sang.
-She sang.

202
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,452
-Are you making fun of me?
-No.

203
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,621
- Did you set me up?
-We're serious.

204
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,916
This is my first acting experience.

205
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,502
I'll do my best. Let's go.

206
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,587
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

207
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,380
Let's go.

208
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:44,887
<i>I'm proud that you're my woman</i>

209
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,348
<i>I used to be gruff</i>

210
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,558
<i>Now I smile all the--</i>

211
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,646
Jeong Jin-hwan!

212
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,064
"How…"

213
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,440
"How can…"

214
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,738
Who was that?

215
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,536
Where is she going?

216
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,788
-Hey.
-What?

217
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,414
-I'm sorry.
-Isn't it here?

218
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,582
-No. You passed it.
-No? I did.

219
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,793
-Are we competing for the ending?
-Yes, you are.

220
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,378
Here we go.

221
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,295
One.

222
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,090
-I can't do it.
-Next dialogue.

223
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,425
Come on.

224
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,178
What's going on? I can't continue.

225
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,890
"But he's already…" I'm sorry.

226
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,225
"Both domestically…"

227
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm really sorry.

228
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,062
"Dae-sung hasn't…"

229
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,856
I'm really sorry.

230
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,360
I guess that's all for me, Director.

231
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,320
I guess I can't do it.

232
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,614
"I believe the statement
to be contradictory.

233
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,784
I'd like to…"
I'm sorry. I looked at the camera.

234
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,330
-NG.
-I did it the other way.

235
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,456
How did you know?

236
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,421
-I'm sorry.
-Wait.

237
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,592
These are my real tears.

238
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,885
"You know it's Sol-i's birthday
this Saturday, right?"

239
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,598
What was my line?

240
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,683
-"What does that have to do with me?"
-Okay. I'm sorry.

241
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,519
"'He is my boyfriend.'
Why can't you say that?"

242
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,687
One more time.

243
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,443
"Anyway, Heon, someday in the future…"

244
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,654
-"In the future…"
-Why are you stuttering?

245
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,281
-"In the future…"
-Why?

246
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,365
Come in!

247
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,743
Again.

248
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,911
-Sorry.
-What?

249
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,124
A little closer.

250
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,585
Okay, one more time. A little closer.

251
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,671
"Sol-i missed you so much.

252
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,799
This much!"

253
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,054
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

254
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,639
Next.

255
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,268
You must be husband and wife.

256
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,353
-No.
-Yes.

257
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,313
-No.
-Yes.

258
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,524
What's your relationship?

259
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,068
We're siblings.

260
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,616
"The refrain? Got it, sir."

261
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,786
I'm sorry. It's hard not to laugh.

262
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,456
"My girlfriend isn't feeling well."

263
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,460
I'm sorry. I forgot the lyrics.

264
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,796
Not lyrics. I meant my lines.

265
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,048
"Next week!"

266
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,342
"Go, Park Ji-sung!"

267
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,803
-It wasn't just me.
-"Go, Park Ji-sung!"

268
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:47,152
<i>You're lovely from head to--</i>

269
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,571
Good work, everyone!

270
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,864
Heart.

271
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,783
-The end.
-The end.

272
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:58,330
