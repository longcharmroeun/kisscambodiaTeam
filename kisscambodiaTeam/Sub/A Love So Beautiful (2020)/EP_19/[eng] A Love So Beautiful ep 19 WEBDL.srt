00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,914
Any ideas for dinner?

3
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,041
I don't know. What should we have?

4
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,417
Let's go out for dinner.

5
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,005
Dr. Cha, this is for you.

6
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,968
-Thank you.
-I heard things have been rough.

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,970
Dr. Park's been worried.

8
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,224
People just love you
both here and at the campus.

9
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,645
Honey!

10
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,022
Sol-i's here.

11
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,108
Sol-i waited for so long!

12
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,277
"Coming through."

13
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:16,535
Sol-i missed you so much.
She was dying to see you!

14
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,538
Just how much, you ask?

15
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,832
This much!

16
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,852
Why are you already here?

17
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,645
I said I'd go to you after work.

18
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,940
No reason. I missed you so much.

19
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,401
I doubt that's the case.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,614
You're always busy,
so I don't mind coming to see you.

21
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,204
Heon.

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,416
Can we stay like this for a while?

23
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,335
I need to get recharged.

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,972
Sol-i.

25
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,099
Yes?

26
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,150
Now that you're here, I don't want to go.

27
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,403
Already?

28
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,410
They're calling me.

29
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,372
I'll get going.

30
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,304

Jang Yeon-bok, male, 48.

37
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,735
He arrived at the hospital today
at 9:30 a.m.

38
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,945
and received a cardiac angiogram,

39
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,491
but a coronary artery bypass graft
was performed due to his stent stricture.

40
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,160
Dr. Yoo Min-hyeon led the surgery,

41
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,788
and it took 5 hours and 30 minutes,
from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

42
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,000
The surgery was successful,
and the patient regained consciousness.

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,710
Extubation followed.

44
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,755
Here. Congratulations
on opening the art studio.

45
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,173
Thanks.

46
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,925
Do you know you're the last one to visit?

47
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,887
I got upset
because I thought you wouldn't come.

48
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,558
I'm sorry.
I've been too busy with job hunting.

49
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,143
So? Is it going well?

50
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,396
Unsuccessful, I guess.

51
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,069
It must be tough. Shall I help?

52
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,739
No, it's okay.

53
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,660
You need connections
to work at art studios these days.

54
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,704
Come and work for me. I'll hire you.

55
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,501
Honestly, it's okay.

56
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,593
-How are you feeling, sir?
-Good.

57
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,305
If everything checks out,
you'll go home next week.

58
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,432
Sure. Thank you for everything.

60
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,692
I sent out job applications
to at least a dozen studios.

61
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,488
Why are none of them
asking for an interview?

62
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,204
Could it be…

63
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,872
Please.

64
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,463
YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE INTERNSHIP

65
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,012
Wait. I should call Heon first.

66
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,977
Please pick up.

67
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,106
You were at the top of your class
in medical school

68
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,400
and have been leading
a successful internship.

69
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,235
Thank you.

70
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:05,115
That's why I recommended you
for the training program in the US.

71
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,450
Pardon?

72
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,746
Why did you come? I said I'm okay.

73
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,498
You should have seen a doctor.

74
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,751
Here. have this porridge
and take your medicine.

75
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,129
Thanks, Ha-young. Thanks, Jin-hwan.

76
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,300
Sol-i, your boyfriend's a doctor.
You should call him right now.

77
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,303
-But he's busy.
-That's hardly an excuse.

78
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,222
My heart sinks even when Ha-young sneezes.

79
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,682
What's more important than--

80
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,810
Sol-i, get some rest.

81
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,022
-Okay.
-Anyway, we'll get going.

82
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,274
-Get well soon.
-Good luck on your job interview.

83
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,358
See you.

84
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,197
Ha-young, why are you flushed?

85
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,617
Did you catch a cold from her?

86
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,868
Stop it!

87
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,126
Should we cancel the movie
and rest at home?

88
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,961
I'm fine.

89
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,213
Come here.

90
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,507
I won't let you get sick.

91
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,177
Come on. Will you please stop?

92
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,471
How can I when you're sick?

93
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,102
<i>I already had dinner. What about you?</i>

94
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,353
<i>Heon, are you busy?</i>

95
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,522
<i>I waited to tell you over the phone.</i>

96
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,483
<i>Heon, my In Design resume was accepted.</i>

97
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,235

00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,014
RESUME

103
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,020
Ms. Shin, I see you went
to graduate school.

104
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,066
Yes, I felt the need
of broader, more structured education,

105
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,817
so I went to graduate school.

106
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,195
"Broader and more structured."

107
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,529
Everyone says that.

108
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,824
-Pardon?
-What do your parents do?

109
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,369
They run a small restaurant.

110
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,080
Their business must be going well.

111
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,373
Pardon?

112
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:46,711
I mean, not all parents can pay tuition
for their children's graduate school.

113
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,548
I just noticed
there's not much on your portfolio,

114
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,966
not even contest results.

115
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,430
Let's just wrap it up. You can leave now.

116
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,060
The interview's over. Next?

117
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,188
I see.

118
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,149
Thank you.

119
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,300
<i>Are you busy today?</i>

120
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,970
<i>One of my teachers can't make it today.</i>

121
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,681
<i>Could you fill in for the day?</i>

122
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,516
<i>I'll pay you generously.</i>

123
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,871
Exhausting, right? I bet you're hungry.

124
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,291
It's my treat for you.

125
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,712
-Thank you.
-How was it like working here?

126
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,297
Was it all right?

127
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,052
I don't think I'm good enough
to teach anyone just yet.

128
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,389
Think again. I'll help you out.

129
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,725
Haven't you heard?

130
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,977
I'm the best mentor you can find.

131
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,982
What are you doing?

132
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,276
Can't you tell?

133
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,388
Dr. Cha will go to the States, won't he?

134
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,390
You'll miss him, won't you?

135
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,185
Ms. Yoon, I told you it's not like that.

136
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,436
I know.

137
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,355
I'll probably miss him more.

138
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,608
Things will be dull around here
without the handsome Dr. Cha.

139
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,904
According to Dr. Heo,
he's leaving next month.

140
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,614
What? That soon?

141
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,658
I'll definitely miss him.

142
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,427
Sol-i, how was your job interview?

143
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
Why did you come without telling me?

144
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,596
Let's break up.

145
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:27,932

00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,022
What are you…

147
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,692
You're going to the US.

148
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,073
Why didn't you tell me?

149
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,747
I haven't decided yet.

150
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,546
Am I not a factor in that decision?

151
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,217
Sol-i.

152
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,280
What's wrong?

153
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,658
I can't

154
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,204
take it anymore.

He's wrapping things up.

-Dr. Cha, V-tach!
-Bring the defibrillator. Hurry.

164
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,317
And the epinephrine.

-Charged.

-Two hundred joules.
-Charged.

168
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,207
Doctor, his blood pressure is dropping.

169

Hello.

175
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,354
Could you…

176
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,566
tell Sol-i that I'm here?

177
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,569
Her phone's turned off.

178
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,615
Sol-i packed up and moved out today.

179
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,034
Didn't you know?

Sol-i.

183
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,435
I'm leaving today.

184
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,820
Will you

185
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:58,823
come to see me?

186
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,952
Don't wait for me.

187
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,507

191
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,941
-It's been a while.
<i>-It really is you, Heon.</i>

192
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,193
<i>Weren't you going to settle in the States?</i>

193
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,487
I should have said hello sooner.
I'm Woo Dae-sung.

194
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,698
-<i>What brings you here?</i>
-I'll always be here for Sol-i.

195
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,408
<i>Please do your best.</i>

196
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,703
<i>What? That's unlike you
to ask for a favor.</i>

197
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,747
<i>Drink this. I thought you don't drink.</i>

198
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,707
-Thank you.
-Good job.

199
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,835
You're welcome. You asked me a favor.

200
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,379
<i>How do you know each other?</i>

201
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,922
<i>You're Shin Sol-i, right?</i>

202
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,550
-How do you know Dr. Cha?
-Why do you ask?

203
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,261
<i>Sol-i, did you ever regret your decision?</i>

204
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,722
<i>Don't you want to know why I came back?</i>

205
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:34,270
