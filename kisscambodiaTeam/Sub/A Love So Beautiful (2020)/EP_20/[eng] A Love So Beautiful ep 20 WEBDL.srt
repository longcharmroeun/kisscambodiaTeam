JULY 2019, SUMMER OF THIRTY

3
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,221
DAE-SUNG

4
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,686
Hi, Dae-sung. Are you here?

5
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,396
<i>Yes. I'll wait on the first floor.</i>

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,480
Okay.

7
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,949
I have high hopes for both of you.

8
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,952
I've told everyone in this hospital

9
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,204
all about you two for three years.

10
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,915
The States wanted you,

11
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,377
but I managed to convince them
to send you back to my hospital.

12
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,713
Thank you.

13
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,132
-Dr. Heo.
-What?

14
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,967
I mean, Director Heo.

15
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,386
Are you happy to have us here?

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,264
-I am.
-Director Heo, let's go!

17
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,474
Let's go.

18
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:54,990
Be careful.

19
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,742
What's the rush?

20
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,368
Dae-sung, what should I do?

21
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,829
I'm so sorry,
but I need to go to the hospital first.

22
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,831
The hospital? Are you sick?

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,958
No, it's my dad. He got hospitalized.

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,252
-Get in.
-Okay.

25
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,024
You can go downstairs
to get the blood test results.

26
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,776
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

27
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,695
Hello. I have a question.

28
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,946
-Where is…
-What's up?

29
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,323
…the Orthopedics Department?

30
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,532
You go first.

31
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,327
The Orthopedics Department is over there.

32
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,245
I see.

33
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,455
-Okay.
-Thank you.

34
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,088
<i>Those who are in charge
of patient Kim Ji-suk in Room 151,</i>

35
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,965
<i>please return to the ward.</i>

36
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,402
Heon, it's been a while.

37
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,240
Yes.

38
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,619
What brings you here?

39
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,581
Dae-sung.

40
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,708
Let's go.

41
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,929
See you.

42
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,207
He's your friend
that's always on TV, right?

43
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,793
Thank you.

44
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,592
I should have said hello sooner.
I'm Woo Dae-sung.

45
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,430
You look better in person than on TV.

46
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,226
Have some juice.

47
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,519
Okay.

48
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,150
By the way, what brings you here?
I know you're very busy.

49
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,235
I saw you on TV.

50
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:04,114
You're always on commercials
with half-naked women.

51
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,448
-Mom.
-Honey.

52
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,616
Don't.

53
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,078
-What?
-Still, I'll always be here for Sol-i.

54
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,499
Open this for me.

55
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,167
Open it.

56
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,629
Great job.

57
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,256
Here. Take it.

58
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,050
-What? Why--
-Yes, thank you.

59
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,721
Come on. What's wrong?

60
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,681
You get on my nerves.

61
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,475
Did you eat?

62
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,685
No, not yet.

63
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,858
Dr. Seo.

64
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,446
-Are you busy?
-Have you been looking for me?

65
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,407
Who will do the surgery
on patient Shin Gi-heon, Room 1504?

66
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,410
So you were looking for me for a reason.

67
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,163
Solve this riddle if you want the answer.

68
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,540
Which martial arts
does Winnie the Pooh practice?

69
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,461
-Kung "Pooh."
-What? That was fast.

70
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,004
Who will perform the surgery?

71
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,090
Dr. Kim Hyeon-gi will,
and I'll be assisting him.

72
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,550
Why are you asking?

73
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,969
Please do your best.

74
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,431
What? That's unlike you
to ask for a favor.

75
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,849
Is that all?

76
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,850
Bye.

77
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,728
What's it about?

78
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,563
Damn it.

79
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,358
Why didn't Sol-i tell us the room number?

80
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
I know, right?

81
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,235
She's not answering her phone either.

82
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,905
-Which room is it?
-Thank you.

83
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:28,907
Where is she?

84
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,493
Jin-hwan.

85
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,082
What am I looking at?

86
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,835
Ha-young, I think
I need to be hospitalized again.

87
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,253
I'm seeing things.

88
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,713
Cha Heon is in front of me.

89
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,839
Your eyes are fine.

90
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,216
It's been a while.

91
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,801
It's you.

92
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,679
It really is you, Heon.

93
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,974
What? Weren't you going to settle
in the States?

94
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,518
Right. Why didn't you even give us a call?

95
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:58,812
Sorry.

96
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,359
It's good to see you again.

97
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,694
I'm glad you're back.

98
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,405
I missed you, my friend.

99
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,713
Get in. I'll drive you home.

100
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,299
I'll take a cab.

101
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,762
It's hard to get a cab here at this hour.

102
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,895
Excuse me! Aren't you going to get in?

103
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,721
Where to?

104
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,433
Just drop me off at the nearest station.

105
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,436
Sol-i.

106
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,527
Chiamun Junction.

107
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,931
SURGERY STATUS
SHIN GI-HEON, FINISHED

108
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,891
Mom, it's over.

109
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,278
The operation was successful.

110
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,782
Thank you, Doctor.

111
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,867
-Thank you.
-Good job.

112
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,370
You're welcome. You asked me a favor.

113
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,582
Heon, how considerate of you. Thank you.

114
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,500
You're welcome.

115
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,127
By the way,

116
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,588
how do you know each other?

117
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,299
We're just colleagues.

118
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,886
Dr. Cha barely had any friends
in the States.

119
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,888
So I became his friend.

120
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,557
"Colleagues."

121
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,394
But you're too pretty
to be just a colleague.

122
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,355
-Do you have--
-Mom.

123
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,690
We should go see Dad.

124
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,074
She said they're colleagues.

125
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,786
Is she's the one?

126
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,497
See you.

127
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,672
Excuse me.

128
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,758
Did I scare you?

129
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,053
Yes. A little.

130
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,306
Sorry. My apologies.

131
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,852
Here.

132
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,437
Sit down.

133
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,441
You're Shin Sol-i, right? I'm Seo Ji-su.

134
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,401
Okay.

135
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,612
I have a lot of questions. Can I ask you?

136
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,573
I won't take no for an answer.

137
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,366
Okay.

138
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,702
How did you and Dr. Cha meet?

139
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,372
Why do you ask?

140
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,958
I was wondering if you know her.

141
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,461
Dr. Cha's long-time girlfriend.

142
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,088
"Girlfriend"?

143
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,092
But why do you want to know?

144
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,554
Isn't it funny?

145
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,973
What is?

146
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,809
Who dates such a bore like him?

147
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,941
I don't think he's that boring. Is he?

148
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:18,321
When he was in the States,
he talked about her a lot.

149
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,574
I think he still loves her very much.

150
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,911
That's why I was curious.

151
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,329
Do you know who she is?

152
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,499
No.

153
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,801
What's all this?

154
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,809
All right. Ta-da.

155
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,603
Bring this to Heon.

156
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,316
He asked the surgeons for extra care
for your dad's surgery.

157
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,151
I was so grateful,

158
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,779
so I woke up early in the morning
to pack this.

159
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,032
And eat this with him
after you deliver it.

160
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,326
I prepared two portions in total.

161
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,039
Mom, it's okay. It's past lunchtime.

162
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,126
Be more empathetic, will you?

163
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,420
Didn't you see how skinny Heon got?

164
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,423
It seems that he doesn't have time
to have a proper meal.

165
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,340
Go.

166
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,801
Hurry.

167
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,396
Seriously.

168
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,072
What are you doing?

169
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,282
What?

170
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:45,950
You scared me.

171
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,375
Mom told me to give this to you.

172
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,757
Let's share.

173
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,216
I just ate.

174
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,562
Ha-young! Jin-hwan!

175
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,272
-You're here!
-Ha-young!

176
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,232
I missed you.

177
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,400
Hey, Sol-i.

178
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,404
Jeong Jin-hwan.

179
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,783
Why are you still so overprotective
when it's been ten years?

180
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,243
She's right. Jin-hwan, take it easy.

181
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,790
It's been a while
since we gathered together. Right?

182
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,084
Not everyone's here though.

183
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,668
One person is missing.

184
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,381
So I called him over.

185
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,594
-Why did you call him?
-Heon is our friend, too.

186
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,606
Sorry I'm late.

187
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,088
It's okay. I'm not drunk.

188
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,345
Sol-i, you're drunk.

189
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,099
I said I'm not drunk.

190
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,601
Drink this.

191
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,823
I thought you don't drink.

192
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,158
I was thirsty.

193
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,372
Stop. That's enough. Let's go.

194
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,875
Whatever. I'm upset.

195
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,628
So you guys should buy gifts
for our wedding.

196
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,339
Sol-i, buy us an air purifier.

197
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,049
Heon, a fridge.

198
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,344
Dae-sung, buy a washing machine.

199
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,306
Also, the TV that you endorse.

200
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,808
A hot celebrity can handle that, right?

201
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,978
Hey, Jin-hwan,
are you trying to rip me off?

202
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,938
He called me a cheat.

203
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,733
Dae-sung, we're running late.

204
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,693
I told you we have a photoshoot tomorrow.

205
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,446
It's okay. You should go.

206
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,989
I'm sober now.

207
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,283
-Will you be all right?
-Of course. I'm fine.

208
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,451
Go home now.

209
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
See you.

210
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,093
You should go, too.

211
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,137
We're going to walk home to sober up.

212
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,389
What? From here?

213
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,684
Let Heon give us a ride.
He didn't drink anyway.

214
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,186
Let's just walk.

215
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,938
Heon, take Sol-i home.

216
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,357
Okay.

217
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,485
-Sol-i. Go home safe.
-Okay.

218
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,029
Ha-young, my legs hurt.

219
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,155
Jin-hwan!

220
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,247
I'll go now.

221
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,044
Get in.

222
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,129
I won't annoy you.

223
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,255
A wish bracelet and a Christmas card.

224
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,507
Are you sure it's a bracelet?
Isn't it a necklace?

225
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,637
Gosh, it's so pretty!

226
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,417
Sol-i.

227
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,719
did you ever regret your decision?

228
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,559
No. I haven't.

229
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,186
Don't you want to know

230
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,356
why I came back?

231
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,610
Don't you really know

232
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,156
who I came back for?

233
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,872
I don't want to know.

Get in. I'll drive you home.

last night.</i>

237

You made a big mistake.

238
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,708
<i>Ms. Shin. Something did happen last night.</i>

239
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,878
I'm sorry to give you all this trouble,
Mr. Superstar.

240
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,463
It's okay, Mr. Shin.

241
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,465
<i>What's that huge diamond? Tell me later.</i>
