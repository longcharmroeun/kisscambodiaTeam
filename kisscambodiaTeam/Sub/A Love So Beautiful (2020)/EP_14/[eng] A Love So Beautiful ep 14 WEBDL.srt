00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:42,376
JUNE 2008, SUMMER OF NINETEEN

3
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,260
Where did Mr. Lee go?

4
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,906
Sir.

5
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:14,866
You're here again.

6
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,789
Well, I…

7
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,753
I felt dizzy during class earlier.

8
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,926
I kind of had a stomachache
after lunch, too.

9
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,390
And sometimes I have
this weird ringing in the ears.

10
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,059
Then,

11
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,104
today,

12
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,527
this will do.

13
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,366
Thank you.

14
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,744
You should go back to class
before it starts.

15
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,912
Okay.

16
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,628
Bye.

17
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,807
What's that? Can I have one?

18
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,142
No, you can't.

19
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,977
Let me have one, please.

20
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,520
I feel really dizzy.

21
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,775
Come on.

22
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,486
You're so annoying.

23
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,076
Happy?

24
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,579
Thanks, Ha-young. You saved me.

25
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,457
You're my vitamin.

26
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,670
Mr. Lee is looking for you.

27
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,421
You should go.

28
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,925
Heon, can you come with me?

29
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,396
What's up?

30
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,109
Nothing. Let's go.

31
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,361
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,078
Let's go.

33
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,039
What? Okay.

34
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,424
Let's see.

35
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,050
Yes.

36
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,593
There.

37
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,138
This one is good.

38
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,597
This is good, too.

39
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,851
Super delicious.

40
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,064
Dae-sung, is it okay to buy this much?

41
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,817
Yes, of course.

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,319
I can buy you everything
from there to here.

43
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:00,741
Sweets are the best cure
when you're depressed.

44
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,368
Are you depressed? Why?

45
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,995
You don't feel well these days?

46
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,791
-Is that it?
-What?

47
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,796
-What?
-Oh.

48
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,340
You were talking about me, not you.

49
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,259
Sorry.

50
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,140
Can you even focus on studying right now?

51
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,812
I'll take care of it.

52
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,606
You're hurting my pride.

53
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,191
Jeez.

54
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,945
Hey, you just wait here.

55
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,158
Hey, why are we here?

56
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,619
What's the best seller of our time?

57
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,703
It's

58
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,957
<i>He Was Cool Like a Wolf</i>.

59
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,503
Don't tell anyone.
Part Two came in yesterday.

60
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,880
How did you find out?

61
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,381
Don't ask.

62
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,633
There.

63
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,641
Good job.

64
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,309
<i>HE WAS COOL LIKE A WOLF</i>

65
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,454
Just sit here.

66
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,483
Why are you so dazed?

67
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,485
What? What do you mean?

68
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,195
"What? What do you mean?"

69
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,989
You've been daydreaming
since you came back from the library.

70
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,032
What happened?

71
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,244
Nothing.

72
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,957
This one?

73
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,668
-No, it has three leaves. Look closely.
-Look at this.

74
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,836
-This one?
-No.

75
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,004
This isn't it either.

76
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,674
Mi-nyeo, what are they doing?

77
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,759
They're looking for four-leaf clovers.

78
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,386
What? Four-leaf clovers?

79
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,681
If you find one
and give it to the person you like,

80
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,974
your love will come true.

81
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,184
Do you believe that?

82
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,019
You know Ye-dam in Class Three?

83
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,188
She gave a four-leaf clover
to her crush in church.

84
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,648
They've been dating for nine days.

85
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,067
Seon-yeong in Class Four,
A-yeong in Class Nine,

86
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,736
Hyeon-gi, Re-na, and Min-seok
in Class Two, and many more.

87
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,072
Anyway, if you find a four-leaf clover,

88
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,741
you will start a relationship.

89
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,994
-That's awesome.
-Who'd believe that?

90
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,829
Ha-young, let's go find one.

91
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,871
Find what?

92
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,000
-Jin-hwan, you scared us.
-I'm sorry.

93
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,501
Don't bother us.

94
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,421
I'm a man who doesn't bother people.
I'll go now.

95
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,464
-Bye.
-Let's go.

96
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,758
Sol-i, don't bother Ha-young.

97
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,302
-Did you find one?
-No.

98
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,809
Ha--

99
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,621
<i>COSMOS</i>

100
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,438
How can I help you?

101
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,316
Jin-hwan.

102
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:10,985
Yes.

103
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,114
Mr. Lee.

104
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,660
When is your birthday?

105
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,079
July 4th.

106
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,123
Why do you ask?

107
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,222
Hey, Mi-nyeo, wait.

108
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,393
What's the zodiac for July 4th?

109
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,979
It's Cancer.

110
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,774
<i>Scorpio.</i>

111
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh, and…

112
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,986
His is Cancer.

113
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,598
Guys. Ta-da.

114
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,601
Isn't it pretty? I skipped
the whole class looking for this.

115
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,854
I've been looking for it
every break time and lunch hour,

116
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,522
but there were only three-leaf clovers.

117
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,399
I'll give this to Yeon-nam

118
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,193
after class at cram school.

119
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,365
Hey, look. Isn't it pretty?

120
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,910
-It's really pretty.
-It is.

121
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,413
Su-jin, do you think a four-leaf clover
will make your love come true?

122
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,581
What did he just say?

123
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,083
Jin-hwan, are you crazy?

124
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,586
Jin-hwan, why are you overreacting?

125
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
Jin-hwan, what's wrong?

126
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,131
Because she's talking nonsense.

127
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,010
Su-jin didn't do anything wrong.
Why are you mad at her?

128
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,779
Hey, Jin-hwan.

129
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,867
-Why are you acting like this?
-You knew, didn't you?

130
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,703
No, everyone did, didn't they?

131
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,331
-What are you talking about?
-Ha-young likes Mr. Lee.

132
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,833
You all knew that, didn't you?

133
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,341
You must've thought I was ridiculous.

134
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,803
-Jin-hwan.
-Don't touch me.

135
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,036
ONE WEEK LATER

136
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,913
Jin-hwan must be really sick.

137
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,540
How long has he been absent?

138
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,709
I'm bored because
I can't make fun of Jin-hwan.

139
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,336
Can anyone get a hold of Jin-hwan?

140
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
He's not answering my text messages.

141
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,009
I called him, but he didn't answer.

142
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,178
What's going on?

143
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,814
Hui-ji!

144
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,859
Oh Hui-ji, wake up.

145
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,110
Hui-ji!

146
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,779
Hui-ji, wake up. Goodness.

147
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,781
It was my first time seeing someone faint.

148
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,701
-It was really scary.
-What if she doesn't wake up?

149
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,827
Hey.

150
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,412
Be quiet.

151
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,010
Hey, it's total chaos in the staffroom.

152
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,512
Hui-ji's mom is there, throwing a fit.

153
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,889
Come on.

154
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,934
How are you looking after the students?

155
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,022
She was fine this morning when she left.
Why did she faint in school?

156
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,192
Ma'am, please calm down and take a seat.

157
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,402
How can I calm down right now?

158
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,988
This school completely ruined my Hui-ji.

159
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,991
Ma'am, no one ruined Hui-ji.
She's just a little sick--

160
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,284
My kid isn't sick.

161
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,120
Ma'am, don't you think
you've been neglecting her too much?

162
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,999
Lately Hui-ji showed signs
of mild depression.

163
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,084
"Depression"?

164
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,380
Are you telling me to take her
to a hospital because she's depressed?

165
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,673
-No.
-Are you crazy?

166
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,176
You're treating my child
like a sick person!

167
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,303
Ma'am, he didn't mean it that way.

168
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,013
-Let's wait and see.
-Depression.

169
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,974
It's a common medical illness
students in stress suffer from.

170
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,395
So don't overwhelm her
and please take good care of her.

171
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,980
Are you a doctor? What are you?

172
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,441
You're nothing but a school nurse.

173
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,485
You know nothing about my daughter!

174
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,989
My daughter fainted
because you gave her random medication.

175
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,992
It's my fault I was negligent
in administering medication.

176
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,579
-But what's more important is Hui-ji's--
-Mr. Lee.

177
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,497
-See?
-Stop.

178
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,832
You heard him.

179
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,876
He admitted his fault.

180
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,755
How can I trust a person like this
and send my daughter to school?

181
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,383
I'm going to report this
to the Office of Education.

182
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,884
Office of Education?

183
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,970
Apologize to her, Mr. Lee.

184
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,472
Apologize to her now.

185
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,849
What are you doing?

186
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,102
I'll take full responsibility and resign.

187
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,275

NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE THEORY</i>

188
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,283
Mr. Lee.

189
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,578
Ha-young.

190
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,621
You didn't do anything wrong.

191
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,831
Why do you have to quit?

192
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,624
I did nothing wrong.

193
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,960
Hui-ji came in and stole medicine.

194
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,712
I saw her sneaking the pills.

195
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,173
Don't be mean to her. She's unwell.

196
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,592
Take care of her. You're her friend.

197
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,388
Still, if you have to quit like this,

198
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,848
it's not fair.

199
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,519
Don't worry. I'm quite capable.

200
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,646
Lots of places want me.

201
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:33,034
Heon. You knew that Hui-ji was unwell,
didn't you?

202
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,786
Yes.

203
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,999
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

204
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,293
It's okay.

205
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,006
Will Jin-hwan will be okay?

206
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,177
Yes.

207
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:52,845
Don't worry.

208
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,230
-Let's go.
-One.

209
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,398
-Two.
-Hey, did you see?

210
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,567
Hui-ji posted something
on the school bulletin board.

211
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,487
She said she stole the medication,
and Mr. Lee was innocent.

212
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,989
She also wrote she was going abroad
and said goodbye.

213
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,533
-Isn't it crazy?
-For real?

214
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,035
-No way.
-I told you it wasn't true.

215
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,828
-It's the truth.
-Se-hyeong.

216
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,331
Start practicing.

217
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm not lying.

218
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,168
Spin him.

219
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,796
Are you all right?

220
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,297
Why wouldn't I be?

221
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,343
Jin-hwan hasn't called, has he?

222
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,512
I'm sure he isn't calling me
because he's okay.

223
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,599
Gather around.

224
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,310
Hurry up.

225
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,649
We'll start the fitness test.

226
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,234
Come forward.

227
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,361
Are you Number One? Okay.

228
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,630
What?

229
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,841
-Isn't that Jin-hwan?
-Unbelievable.

230
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,112
Look at that punk's hair.

231
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,867
Hey! I heard you were in the hospital.
Why are you here?

232
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,455
Why aren't you answering me?
Hey, come here.

233
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,665
-Come over here.
-Sir. Wait.

234
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,250
-Wait.
-What? Let go.

235
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,127
-One, two--
-Three.

236
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,129
-Hey!
-Please wait, sir.

237
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,840
Heon, what are you doing?

238
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,091
Hello.

239
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,218
As you all know,

240
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,137
my name is Jeong Jin-hwan.

241
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,766
Jin-hwan, you're so cool!

242
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,269
-Stop.
-Well.

243
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:09,315
I'm up here today because

244
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,990
I want to ask a girl I like
to officially go out with me.

245
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,284
Jin-hwan, you're the man!

246
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,037
That little…

247
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,248
She is

248
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,376
pretty.

249
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,586
Especially when she smiles.

250
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,172
She has a pretty face,

251
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,841
she's smart,
and she has a great personality.

252
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,471
She's a wonderful girl
who's better than me in many ways.

253
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,264
Hey, get down from there!

254
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,016
-Come here.
-Stop him.

255
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:48,479
-What are you doing? Hey!
-Hold his legs.

256
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,605
So far,

257
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,982
I have never told her

258
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,277
how I felt about her sincerely.

259
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:00,449
So she probably thought
I was only kidding.

260
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,493
But just for today,

261
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,746
I want to tell her
from the bottom of my heart.

262
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,173
Ha-young.

263
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,843
I really

264
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,723
like you with all my heart.

265
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,228
Kang Ha-young! I like you!

266
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,233
-He likes her!
-Wow!

267
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,985
-Date him!
-Goodness.

268
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,779
-Give him a hug.
-Go.

269
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,449
-I can't believe this.
-Amazing.

270
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,367
-That's so cool.
-Nice.

271
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,744
He likes her!

272
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,166
"I like you," my foot.
Wait, is she smiling?
