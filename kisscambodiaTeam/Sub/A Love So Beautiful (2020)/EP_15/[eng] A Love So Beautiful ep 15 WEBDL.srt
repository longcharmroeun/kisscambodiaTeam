2
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,872
I'll draw some blood.

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,501
Raise your arm, please.

4
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,729
Darn, it hurts!

5
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,815
It hurts!

6
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,527
It doesn't hurt at all.

7
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,988
Are you done already?
I didn't feel a thing.

8
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,533
I haven't even inserted the needle yet.

9
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,618
Here I go.

10
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,333
That hurts!

11
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,960
Are you feeling better now?

12
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,254
Of course. I'm as good as new again.

13
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,966
Guys, don't I look cooler
in this hospital gown?

14
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,720
He's back to his old self again.

15
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,147
Ha-young will be here soon.

16
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,774
I think.

17
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,404
You're high school seniors.
Aren't you busy?

18
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,324
Is it okay for you to be here?

19
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,828
Ha-young!

20
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,005
These are class notes.

21
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,215
I figured you'd need them.

22
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,720
It's okay.

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,681
My mom hired a tutor for me.

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,602
Really?

25
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,153
-Dae-sung!
-Yes?

26
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,864
Why does it seem
like you lost some muscle?

27
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,240
Have you been slacking off?

28
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:41,411
Let's see. You were slacking off!
Practice harder!

29
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,873
Cha Heon! Are you studying hard?

30
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,376
Help Sol-i study from time to time

31
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,128
and lend a helping hand. Okay?

32
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,339
Right. Study hard, guys.

33
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,718
By the way, swimmers are more muscular
in the shoulders and back.

34
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,011
Feel my shoulders--

35
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,097
-What's wrong? Are you all right?
-Seriously?

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,141
Seriously, swimming student?

37
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,061
Sorry. But you know what?

38
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,522
Swimmers tend to have slimmer arms.

39
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,816
Heon!

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,192
-Hello.
-Hi.

41
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,903
-Hi, Geon.
-Hi, Sol-i.

42
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,948
Heon, are you going to be a math teacher?

43
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,742
-"Math teacher"?
-Not a math teacher.

44
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,119
A mathematics professor.

45
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,829
That's right, a professor.

46
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,873
Heon, I heard you'll become a professor
if you go to KEIST.

47
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,542
KEIST?

48
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,462
Yes, my mom said
he'll be studying at KEIST.

49
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,507
I see. KEIST.

50
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,679
You have to be really smart
to get in there.

51
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,557
Anyway, Sol-i,
which university will you go to?

52
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,144
I'm not sure.

53
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,440
-Ms. Moon, I'll head inside first.
-Sure.

54
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,025
-See you again, Geon.
-Bye, Sol-i!

55
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,445
-Go home and get some rest.
-Okay.

56
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,072
Heon, I'll get going.

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,199
Sure.

58
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,299
It will depend on the major you select,

59
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,428
but with your current grades…

60
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,471
ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT STATUS

61
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,349
You'll have a shot at a local college.

62
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,104
It's not too late
to start studying harder now.

63
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,942
Ms. Moon, in that case…

64
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,488
-What about KEIST?
-Where?

65
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,118
No. Never mind.

66
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,079
If you study really hard,
you will get good results.

67
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,915
Try your best.

68
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,168
Sure.

69
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,508
KEIST?

70
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,886
I must've heard wrong.

71
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,312
I clearly warned you before.

72
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,940
It's no longer
about your swimming career now.

73
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,817
At this rate,

74
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,571
you might not be able
to move your shoulders anymore.

75
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,365
Doctor,

76
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,868
prescribe me some painkillers
to handle the pain for a few days.

77
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,453
I can't.

78
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,623
I'll handle my pain.

79
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,793
I can't give up
right before the national team selection.

80
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,422
Coach, I mean…

81
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,134
Dad.

82
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,763
I can do this. You know that.

83
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:03,048
<i>Making you my lady became a dream of mine</i>

84
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,633
<i>I will…</i>

85
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,392
What on Earth? What's going on?

86
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,646
I'm sorry,
but I desperately need your help.

87
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,653
See that girl over there
right in front of my ward?

88
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,656
Can you please tell her

89
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,409
that I was discharged
and I'll never be back here again?

90
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,329
I can't, Mr. Jung.
Please go back to your room now.

91
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,414
Please. I'm begging you.

92
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,834
Just this once.

93
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,297
You're Jin-hwan's friend, right?

94
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,216
Yes.

95
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,344
He asked me to tell you
that he's been discharged.

96
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,032
Mr. Jung,
go back to your room immediately!

97
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,662
Just give me one minute.
No, thirty seconds.

98
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,041
Please go back to your ward.

99
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,418
Fifteen seconds, please.

100
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,688
Your friend is leaving.

101
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,122
Thank you.

102
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,003
Mr. Lee, thank you for all you've done.

103
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,632
Visit us from time to time
when you're back in Korea.

104
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,092
Sure.

105
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,679
Thank you for everything.

106
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,183
Keep us updated every now and then.

107
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,269
Thanks a lot.

108
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,835
Remember how I said I'm quite capable?

109
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,756
I was immediately offered a job,
so I accepted it.

110
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,800
Mr. Lee.

111
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,094
I've always wanted to live in the US.

112
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,056
Make sure to call me
if you ever come to the US.

113
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,850
I'll be there at the airport
to pick you up.

114
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,815
Promise me.
I'll definitely visit there someday.

115
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,483
Sure.

116
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,823
We'll greet each other with a smile
when that day comes.

117
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,661
-Okay.
-Keep studying hard.

118
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,122
Take care.

119
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,464
Bye, Mr. Lee.

120
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,460
Did he leave? Did you say goodbye?

121
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,547
Yes, I did.

122
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,096
Doesn't it feel like something is missing?

123
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,016
I guess.

124
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,185
But we'll probably get used to it soon.

125
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,440
Would we?

126
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,567
I highly doubt it.

127
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,486
Why's that? Is something going on?

128
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,865
One question.

129
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,535
How long will it take
to get from Suwon to KEIST?

130
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,412
Over two hours?

131
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:46,998
Probably.

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,793
Do you think

133
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:55,048
there's a possibility
that Heon doesn't make it into KEIST?

134
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,676
If we don't go to the same university,
we'll have a long-distance relationship.

135
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,388
Still, two hours is short.

136
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,141
I'll need a twelve-hour trip to the US.

137
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,027
Did you buy this for me? Thanks.

138
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,406
No, I bought that for Heon…

139
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,327
That's really delicious.

140
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,579
I only finished half of it.

141
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,790
What? There's only half a carton left.

142
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,504
Heon, this is for you.

143
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,573
Beginners

144
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,742
can start first.

145
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,037
You first.

146
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,581
No, you.

147
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,338
Hurry up and start.
I'm on the winner's side.

148
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,466
Good luck.

149
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,362
That was awesome!

150
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,090
Good luck, Heon.

151
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,472
That was so close.

152
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,682
That was close.

153
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,523
You're so cool!

154
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,650
You must be good at every sport.

155
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,818
Right?

156
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,238
I do look cooler when I'm playing sports.

157
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,573
What do you say?
Do you want me to teach you?

158
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,742
-Yes, teach me!
-Okay, here.

159
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,161
Sol-i, let's go.

160
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,747
What? Already?

161
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,874
But I want to give this a shot.

162
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,669
-All I did was watch.
-Aren't you going to study?

163
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,338
Just a little. Please.

164
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,258
I'll get going, then.

165
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,014
-Hold the cue.
-All right.

166
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,642
Place your hand here

167
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:39,188
and make a circle with your thumb
and index finger like that.

168
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,273
Palm on the table.

169
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,732
-The table?
-Yes.

170
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,234
And the elbow at a right angle.

171
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,236
-Right angle.
-Bend down a little lower.

172
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,156
One, two…

173
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,161
-Teach me some other time. Bye!
-Okay.

174
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,388
Heon, that wasn't your first time, right?

175
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,016
It was.

176
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,728
You're good at everything!

177
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,896
Well…

178
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,732
Anyway, don't be intimidated.

179
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,818
You didn't lose today
because you're bad at playing pool.

180
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,529
It's because Dae-sung's too good at it.

181
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,157
He's an all-round sportsman.

182
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,201
I bet there's no sport he's bad at.

183
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:37,205
So if you played against someone else,
you might have won.

184
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,229
Hey! Take it outside.

185
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,147
Get out of here.

186
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,653
How's the cleaning coming along?

187
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,112
Good. Why?

188
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,992
You must've cleaned really hard.

189
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,495
What's this on your face? Let me see.

190
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,830
-Sol-i.
-Yes?

191
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,832
Ms. Moon wants to see you.

192
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,292
What? Me?

193
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,297
Why would she?
I don't think I caused any trouble.

194
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,883
I didn't doze off in class

195
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,761
and I did all my homework.
What could it be?

196
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,639
-Hurry up and go.
-Right.

197
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,193
Heon,

198
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,280
I didn't know you could lie.

199
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,668
Hello.

200
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,006
Ms. Moon, why did you want to see me?

201
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,552
-I wanted to see you?
-Sorry?

202
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,887
That's what Heon said.

203
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,015
Did I?

204
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,729
I'm in the middle of a consultation,
so I'll talk to you later.

205
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,272
Sure.

206
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,901
So how's Dae-sung?

207
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,905
His old shoulder injury
hasn't been getting better.

208
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,993
If he doesn't take precautions,
his career will be in danger.

209
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,370
He might

210
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,998
have to give up swimming.

211
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,878
You must be devastated.

212
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,101
I haven't had junk food for ages.

213
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,520
Now that I'm eating this,

214
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,649
I feel like crying.

215
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,820
Dae-sung,

216
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,573
do your shoulders

217
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,617
hurt a lot?

218
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,993
What?

219
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,745
Will you have to quit swimming?

220
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,999
No, Brother. I'm Marine Boy Woo Dae-sung.

221
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,794
It will be as good as new
when I get treated. Don't worry.

222
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,214
Are you sure you're okay?

223
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,632
Of course.

224
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,011
Maybe I'll take up studying
in the meantime.

225
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,639
Hey, it's not for everyone, you know.

226
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,016
You're the coolest when you're swimming.

227
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,728
No, I'm not I'm good at everything.

228
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,107
I bet you didn't know
that sports require intelligence too.

229
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,652
What? I don't think
I've ever heard of that before.

230
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,363
Anyway, starting tomorrow,
we'll study together.

231
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:00,658
Got it.

232
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,377
Heon!

233
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,172
Are you taking out the trash again?

234
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,800
Geon wanted to eat this.

235
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,346
Where have you been?

236
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,765
I grabbed a bite to eat with Dae-sung.

237
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,142
-Just the two of you?
-Yes.

238
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,520
Dae-sung and I decided that
we'll study really hard.

239
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,313
That's out of the blue. Why?

240
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,732
Why?

241
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,943
I have my reasons.

242
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,489
By the way, why are you asking
so many questions today?

243
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:42,992
Am I?

244
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,912
Never mind.
Heon, good luck on the interview tomorrow.

245
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,416
I'm sure you'll be accepted
to the university you want to attend.

246
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,298
I might

247
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,175
not be accepted.

Sol-i spent whining here?</i>

-I won't go there.</i>

253
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,899
I want to be by Sol-i's side.

254
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,567
Sol-i.

255
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,903
I like you a lot.

Heon, I'm going to start over.
