00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,303
Dr. Cha.

4
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,266
What? You can't get a hold of Ms. Shin?

5
00:00:58,976 --> 00:00:59,893
No.

6
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,313
Just be honest with me.

7
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,398
She just keeps

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,692
avoiding me.

9
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,070
I guess she finally came to her senses.

10
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,405
What?

11
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,949
If I were her,
I'd be dating someone else already.

12
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,368
Besides, she's adorable.

13
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:20,497
I'm sure she already has
a lot of great guys around her.

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,719
Cheer up.

15
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,017
1 NOTIFICATION

16
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,813
Dae-sung's having an autograph event.

17
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,525
WOO DAE-SUNG'S AUTOGRAPH EVENT
WITH TITAGONIA

18
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,030
Go back to your seat.

19
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,491
-What?
-Silent mode, please?

20
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:00,412
This notice put me in a good mood,
so I'll just let it slide.

21
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,456
He hasn't had an event in Korea
in so long.

KIM HYEON-JUN
SHIN SOL-I

24
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,273
Thank you so much.

25
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,567
Thank you.

26
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
Hey.

27
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,450
Do you think I have a lot of free time?

28
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:43,163
I'm an idol star to my auntie fans.

29
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,956
I missed a gig because of you.

30
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,509
What is it this time? Just tell me.

31
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,052
I can't get a hold of Sol-i.

32
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,929
Is that why you're here?

33
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,515
-Sol-i is busy now.
-Why?

34
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,393
She won a webtoon contest
and got hired by a huge company.

35
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,228
She's a real writer now.

36
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,523
She’s not the old Sol-i who used to
sit around and wait for you.

37
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,072
Don't expect me to help you
like I did back in the day.

38
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,448
Help me.

39
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,909
No.

40
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,911
I know it's all in the past,

41
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,080
but do you know how tough it was for her?

42
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,957
She was ridiculed at every interview,

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,085
kicked out of the dorm when she was sick,
sexually harassed by--

44
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,587
What did you just say?

45
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,631
That was supposed to be a secret.

46
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,882
Whatever.

47
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,052
If you want to get back with her,
take care of this yourself.

48
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,908
<i>Sol-i. Is the finalization going well?</i>

49
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,078
No. I'm stressed out.

50
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>Can you get it done by the weekend?
We'll have a housewarming party.</i>

51
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,543
I'm not sure.

52
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,629
-If I can't go, just count me out.
-Come on, Sol-i.

53
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,132
How can we have
a housewarming party without you?

54
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,428
By the way, the air here is terrible
because it's a new house.

55
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,637
<i>Be quiet.</i>

56
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,022
<i>Make sure to bring an air purifier.</i>

57
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,607
Okay, okay.

58
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,527
<i>I feel like I'm living with a kid.
He hasn't changed at all.</i>

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,072
What is it?

60
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,617
I'll go to the party!

61
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,285
Cheers!

62
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,870
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

63
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,836
Ha-young,

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,423
your new home is so nice.
You even have a rooftop patio.

65
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,091
Isn't the night view amazing?

66
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,095
I wore out my vocal cords
to earn lots of money.

67
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,848
Do you have a spare room for me?

68
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,058
Hey.

69
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,061
How dare you try to spend a night
at a newlywed's love nest?

70
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,327
Did you get here on a time machine?

71
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,580
You told me to dress up
like we did in high school.

72
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,959
Didn't you mean "dress casually"?

73
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,046
Did you still have your school uniform?

74
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,436
You're cute, Heon.

75
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,981
Get ready.

76
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,108
One, two, three.

77
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,025
So cute!

78
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,740
Please accept my love.

79
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:07,659
One, two, three.

80
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,494
Two, three.

81
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,122
Next is Dae-sung.

82
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,337
One, two, three.

83
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,424
You're next, Heon.

84
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,391
Since you're wearing a uniform anyway,

85
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,476
strike a cute pose.

86
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,894
Come on.

87
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,028
Go home.

88
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,244
Here we go.

89
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,621
One, two, three.

90
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,560
Three.

91
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,647
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I ONCE DRANK PLUM WINE AND GOT WASTED

92
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,941
-REALLY? WHEN? WHERE?
-YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW

93
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,151
IS IT MY TURN NOW? MINE'S NOT SERIOUS.
MY DAD ONCE GAME ME ATHLETE'S FOOT

94
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,821
Here are your pig's trotters.

95
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,703
Isn't that webtoon hilarious?

96
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,080
Do you read this, too?

97
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,333
Of course. I stay up all night reading it.

98
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,211
Honey, buckwheat noodles on the house
for Table Three.

99
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,337
On the house.

100
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,840
I see why your business is thriving.

101
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,884
You have great marketing skills.

102
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,135
It's nothing.

103
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,807
By the way, this webtoon artist
is really pretty in person.

104
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,892
Do you know her?

105
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,603
Of course. She's my daughter.

106
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,690
I see.

107
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,110
Back then, I didn't imagine
you'd become Korea's Marine Boy.

108
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,821
I should have been nicer to you then.

109
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,407
You should have known I'd make it.
I certainly did.

110
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,035
I love your confidence.
You're so cool, my friend.

111
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,093
I have to go.

112
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,469
What? Already?

113
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,304
Did you get a call from the hospital?

114
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,389
Yes.

115
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,858
I'll take Sol-i home.

116
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,076
Bye.

117
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,391
Thank you.

118
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,316
Thanks for the ride.

119
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,027
Sol-i, give me a second.

120
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,570
What?

121
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,927
Shin Sol-i,

122
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,012
be my girlfriend.

123
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,432
I was going to wait,

124
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,727
but I can't stay patient anymore.

125
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,651
-Dae-sung.
-Think carefully.

126
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,986
This is your last chance.

127
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,299
Not anyone can give you
a huge diamond like this.

128
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,718
Do you still say no?

129
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,683
Dae-sung.

130
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,437
I think of you

131
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,191
as a good friend.

132
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,870
You have really low standards.

133
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,836
You still have low standards, too.

134
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,771
My goodness.

135
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,779
It's Woo Dae-sung.

136
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,617
If Dr. Cha the social recluse knows him,

137
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,912
my baby is a real superstar indeed!

138
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,540
"Baby"? Why is he your "baby"?

139
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,501
Anyone handsome and rich is my baby.

140
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,840
What? Get lost and don't bother me.

141
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,803
-Why do you like him?
-Can't you see?

142
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,223
He's talented, handsome, and rich.

143
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:08,102
Plus, he has a magnificent personality.

144
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,856
How do you know his personality?

145
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm sure he's better than you
in every way.

146
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,946
There are lots of good stories
about him online.

147
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,371
He's so handsome.

148
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,332
Hey, isn't that Woo Dae-sung?

149
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,377
How can he look
exactly like he does in that poster?

150
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,797
-He's so handsome.
-Right. He's so handsome.

151
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,718
They probably think
you walked out of that poster.

152
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,179
Drink slowly.

153
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,848
Why did you call me?

154
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,060
Leave me alone tonight.

155
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,695
Whatever you say.

156
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,421
Heon.

157
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,173
You said you were too busy to come,

158
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,383
but here you are.

159
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,688
-Have a drink.
-Bottoms up.

160
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,941
I have to go back.

161
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,363
Sure.

162
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,657
You're always busy.

163
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,422
What did you do for the last three years?

164
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,470
You're drunk.

165
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,183
What kept you too busy
to stay by Sol-i's side?

166
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,403
And why did you come back?

167
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,280
Why are you playing with her heart?

168
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,742
You don't

169
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,620
take her seriously, do you?

170
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,299
You guys think

171
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,928
she likes me more than I like her.

172
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,679
-Doesn't she?
-I like her more.

173
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,306
More than she does.

174
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,726
You know that.

175
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,107
Then why did you leave?
You should have stayed by her.

176
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,191
I thought

177
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,028
she'd come to me if I left.

178
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,408
Because she always did.

179
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,539
But she didn't.

180
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,001
So,

181
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,630
I've been regretting it
for the last three years.

182
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,443
I can't live without Sol-i.

183
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,248
SOL-I

184
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,587
Sol-i.

185
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,255
Did you hear that?

186
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,495
I've never seen you

187
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,872
talk so much.

188
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,958
Cut it out!

189
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,293
You're so loud.

190
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,669
Are you done?

191
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,714
That's enough.

192
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,177
Let's go home.

193
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,929
Ha-young's waiting for me.

194
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,014
My wife.

195
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,565
Let's go.

196
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
I'll go now.

197
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,573
Ha-young.

198
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,283
My wife, Ha-young.

199
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,661
You reek of alcohol. Get in.

200
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,538
Bye.

201
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,792
Ha-young, go home safely.

202
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,126
I will.

203
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,878
Heon, take Sol-i home safely.

204
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,880
Okay.

205
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,677
-Wise Village, Hannam-dong, please.
-Okay.

206
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,378
I'm sorry.

207
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,590
It's my fault.

208
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,390
Will you please forgive me?

209
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,934
Give me

210
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,687
some time.

211
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,486
Dr. Cha!

212
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,905
Did you see?
Woo Dae-sung came to our hospital!

213
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,074
My heart is racing!

214
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,617
Woo Dae-sung?

215
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:48,789
Hey, Heon.

216
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,332
You're here.

217
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,211
It seems like you had a good sleep.

218
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:55,838
Your skin is glowing.

219
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,466
I was born with it.

220
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,469
Don't just swim. Take care of your skin.

221
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,595
My skin?

222
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,722
I'm a celebrity.
