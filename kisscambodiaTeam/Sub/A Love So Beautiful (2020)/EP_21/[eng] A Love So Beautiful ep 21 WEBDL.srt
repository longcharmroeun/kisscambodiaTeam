CHA HEON

3
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,428
Hey, Heon, listen carefully.

4
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,139
I don't know why you did that to me
last night.

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,018
But that thing we did, you know?

6
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,104
You made a big mistake.

7
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,149
You can't do that without my permission!

8
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,321
I mean,
we're not even in a relationship anymore!

9
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,995
I guess she fought with her boyfriend.

10
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,041
Why aren't you saying anything?

11
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,210
<i>Ms. Shin.</i>

12
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,421
Sorry? Who is this?

13
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,172
This is Seo Ji-su.

14
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,467
Dr. Cha's phone kept ringing,
so I answered.

15
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,516
You should have told me sooner, then.

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,476
You didn't give me a chance to.

17
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,896
Anyway, I'll tell him that you called.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,483
Okay. Thanks.

19
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,871
Dr. Cha.

20
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,582
Haven't you forgotten something?

21
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,042
You left this behind.

22
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,127
I forgot.

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,714
What?

24
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,175
Ms. Shin called a second ago.

25
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,510
What did she say again?

26
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,221
Last night…

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,561
Something did happen last night.

28
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:26,980
I'll get going.

29
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,567
Come on. What is it? Tell me.

30
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,118
We'll open the curtains.

31
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,880
How do I look?

32
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,220
I must have saved
my nation in my past life.

33
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,848
Or maybe I saved the universe.

34
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,019
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Ha-young.

35
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,482
Truly incredible. You're really gorgeous.

36
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,361
Let me see. Where are the wings you hid?

37
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,238
You won't fly back to heaven, right?

38
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,282
You look like an angel.

39
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,118
Stop it.

40
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,495
Angel Ha-young, let me take a photo.

41
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,372
One, two…

42
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,556
<i>I'm been blinded
by the beauty of this angel.</i>

43
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,399
-Is it good?
-It is.

44
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,111
What's this? I picked up lunch for you.

45
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,363
Heon already brought one for me.

46
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,199
-He says it's good.
-Really?

47
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,202
Nice. Since you bought it anyway,
give that to Heon.

48
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,581
Forget it. Why should I?

49
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,751
She's right. Just leave it here.
I can eat more.

50
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,753
It will look like she bought it for me.

51
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,713
Right?

52
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,093
You already had enough.

53
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,262
This is a hospital, not a buffet.

54
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,890
I didn't eat that much.

55
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,477
-Leave it here.
-Heon said he's on call tonight.

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,980
He'll be too busy to grab a bite.
Why not give it to him?

57
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,316
-Hurry up.
-Dad.

58
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,569
Let go.

59
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,529
-But--
-Hands off.

60
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,992
Come on. Hurry up. Run along.

61
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,870
Honey, Sol-i…

62
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,415
You embarrass me. Just finish your lunch.

63
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,334
-I've lost my appetite.
-What?

64
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,764
What are you doing?

65
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,522
What's that?

66
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,067
Nothing.

67
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,361
Is that for me?

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,906
No. That's not it.

69
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,327
I was passing by
and got curious about the on-call room.

70
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,704
Come in.

71
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,972
It's a packed meal.
My mom told me to bring it to you.

72
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,184
I'll get going.

73
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,665
Let's share.

74
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,421
It will only take ten minutes.

75
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,824
Are you still angry at me?

76
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,287
I'm not angry.

77
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,461
Sol-i.

78
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,673
Can we make up now?

79
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,767
"Make up"?

80
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,570
We already broke up three years ago.

81
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,947
I never once thought

82
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,617
that we broke up.

83
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,121
I did.

84
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,540
Sol-i.

85
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,511
We're going to make up.

86
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,491
-Be gentle, will you?
-Does that hurt? Sorry.

87
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,246
I'm sorry to give you all this trouble,
Mr. Superstar.

88
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,622
It's okay, Mr. Shin.

89
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,833
I'd do anything to help Sol-i out.

90
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,129
Why would you do anything for her?

91
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,174
That's her way of saying she's grateful.

92
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,099
Are you leaving already?

93
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,059
I thought it was tomorrow.

94
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,353
Hi, Heon. We moved it up a day.

95
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,485
You must be busy.
There's no need to see us off.

96
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,112
It's okay.

97
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,906
Mom, I'll go pay the bill.

98
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,669
YEAR 2019, AUTUMN OF THIRTY

99
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,179
Ha-young, you're stunning.

100
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,015
Kang Ha-young,
congratulations on the wedding.

101
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:17,932
Congratulations.

102
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,643
Thanks, guys. Let's take a photo together.

103
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,686
-Sure.
-Got it.

104
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,774
Jin-hwan!

105
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,651
Stop staring at her and greet your guests.

106
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,782
You.

107
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,659
Go ahead.

108
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,415
Sol-i, doesn't this dress
look better on me?

109
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,959
Yes, it suits you way better.

110
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,711
You look gorgeous.

111
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,465
I'm in deep trouble. What do I do?

112
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,508
What is it?

113
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,220
-What's wrong?
-The wedding rings.

114
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,679
They're gone.

115
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,475
I'm such an idiot! What do I do?
Where did they go?

116
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,102
Is there a hole in my tuxedo?

117
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,562
I don't know where they went.

118
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,730
I mean,

119
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,066
Where else would they be, you idiot?

120
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,986
Don't remind me.
I know I'm the world's biggest idiot!

121
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,492
-You handed them to me earlier.
-What?

122
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,870
That's right!

123
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,877
Okay. Where are they?

124
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,712
Here they are.

125
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,135
The diamond's too big.

126
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,262
It's not mine.

127
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,602
Yours is here.

128
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,565
Yes, these are mine.

129
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,277
Hurry up and go.

130
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,487
Okay, I'll get going.

131
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,405
-Sure.
-Sure.

132
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,366
Hey.

133
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,909
What's with that diamond ring?

134
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,203
-Tell me about it later.
-Just go!

135
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,847
Jin-hwan, congratulations on the wedding.

136
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,557
Mi-nyeo, thank you for coming.

137
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,933
Say hello to Uncle Jin-hwan.

138
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,895
-Hello.
-Hello.

139
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,773
-Motherhood looks great on you.
-Oh, please.

140
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,275
She was always stunning.

141
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,111
-Dad!
-My son!

142
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,115
Wang Se-hyeong, the Super Dad.

143
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,992
Congratulations on welcoming twins.

144
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,620
Come to me for tips
on a successful marriage.

145
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,289
Thanks for being the host.

146
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,874
Boom.

147
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,876
-Shall we go see Ha-young?
-Sure.

148
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,793
Good luck.

149
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,340
Jin-hwan, congratulations on the wedding.

150
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,383
Su-jin! Thank you for coming.

151
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,762
Jin-hwan, congratulations.

152
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,599
Hui-ji! I thought you wouldn't make it
since you were in the States.

153
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,100
Thanks for coming.

154
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,853
-Ha-young's over there.
-See you later.

155
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,897
Jin-hwan.

156
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,108
Look at you.

157
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,656
-Guys, it's been a while.
-Hi, Sol-i.

158
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,617
-See you later.
-Sure.

159
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,245
-How have you been?
-Great.

160
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,791
I heard you'll be getting married
in the States soon.

161
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,085
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

162
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,253
You and Heon should visit sometime.

163
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,841
-Are you catching the bouquet today?
-Yes.

164
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,885
To be honest, I thought it would be you.

165
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,262
Actually…

166
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,016
This reminds me of high school.

167
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,901
What about your family? Do they know?

168
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,697
No.

169
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,916
Please don't tell anyone
I'm suffering from depression.

170
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,573
Heon.

171
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,785
I like you.

172
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,791
I like Sol-i.

173
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,468
<i>I was too young back then,</i>

174
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,803
<i>and I only cared about my feelings.</i>

175
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,183
Heon asked me to give this to one of you.
Whose is this?

176
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,393
But that's Heon's.

177
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,190
Give it to me, sir.
I asked him to lend it to me.

178
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:18,858
Okay.

179
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,910
<i>Sol-i.</i>

180
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,163
<i>I have something to tell you
about the flu.</i>

181
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:38,169
<i>Flu literally causes symptoms
which are much worse than a cold.</i>

182
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,173
<i>In other words, it's like a severe cold.</i>

183
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,843
<i>Symptoms of the flu are just like a cold.</i>

184
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,013
<i>Usually, you get better
after several days.</i>

185
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,560
I think Heon liked you a lot
even back then.

186
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,451
Next, the bride and groom

187
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,622
will say their vows
to promise they'll be together forever.

188
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,215
Jin-hwan,

189
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,803
you wrote a love letter
to all the girls in our high school.

190
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,265
Actually, not all of them.

191
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,268
I never wrote one for you.

192
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:43,401
Instead, you gifted me the only star
that was named after me.

193
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,446
And you gave me
a cute cell phone accessory.

194
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,865
Actually, it was for someone else.

195
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,378
I, Jeong Jin-hwan,
take Kang Ha-young as my wife

196
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,046
as I say these vows.

197
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,591
"Until I take my last breath,

198
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,218
I will be the universe

199
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,430
that protects the planet
known as Kang Ha-young."

200
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,892
"I, Kang Ha-young, whether happy or sad,

201
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,728
will be your one and only fan

202
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,439
that will always listen to your songs.

203
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,359
The two of us met in this vast universe

204
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,612
by a special chance and became one.

205
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,866
We vow before you
that we will love each other more tomorrow

206
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,910
than we do today.

207
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,330
Groom, Jeong Jin-hwan.

208
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,166
Bride, Kang Ha-young.

209
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,199
Kiss the bride!

210
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,825
-Kiss the bride!
-Kiss the bride!

211
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,452
-Kiss the bride!
-Kiss the bride!

212
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,622
-Kiss the bride!
-Kiss the bride!

213
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,123
-Kiss the bride.
-Kiss the bride.

214
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,667
Kiss the bride!

215
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,336
Ha-young.

216
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:27,964
I love you.

217
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,272
The bride will now throw the bouquet.

218
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,232
-Throw it as hard as you can.
-Sure.

219
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,661
What?

221
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,224
Don't expect me to help you
like I did back in the day.

222
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,060
-Help me.
-<i>Did you get here on a time machine?</i>

223
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,854
<i>Strike a cute pose.</i>

224
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,606
Shin Sol-i, be my girlfriend.

225
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,275
Not anyone can give you
a huge diamond like this.

226
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,861
<i>-You can't get a hold of Ms. Shin?
-She keeps avoiding me.</i>

227
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,530
If I were her,
I'd be dating someone else already.

228
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,700
<i>She’s not the old Sol-i who used to
sit around and wait for you.</i>

229
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,620
-That was supposed to be a secret.
-<i>What did you just say?</i>

230
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,206
<i>I'll take Sol-i home.</i>

231
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,083
<i>I'm sorry. Will you please forgive me?</i>

232
