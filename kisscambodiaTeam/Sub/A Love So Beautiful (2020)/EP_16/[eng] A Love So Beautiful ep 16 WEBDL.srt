00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,408
Please write down

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,868
the university and major of your choice.

-Okay.

DESIRED UNIVERSITY SURVEY

13
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,094
Should we do the other ones first?

14
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,806
Yes. Actually, I'm really bad at math.

15
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,558
Should we study English?

16
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,228
No, let's do Korean Language.
At least, we can read the questions.

17
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,689
Yes, you have a point.

18
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,031
By the way, Dae-sung,

19
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,742
did you write in your career prospects?

20
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,454
No, not yet.

21
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,873
What are your career prospects, then?

22
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,084
I didn't write them yet, either.

23
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,630
What do you like to do?

24
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,968
I like to draw,

25
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,056
and…

26
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,355
Let's solve the questions.

27
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,194
"The natural sciences of Epicurus

28
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,489
enable a non-deterministic understanding

29
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,576
of the universe and the human world."

30
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,453
"The natural sciences of Epicurus…"

31
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,998
What does this mean?

32
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,543
It's in Korean, but I don't understand it.

33
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,796
I'll take a look.

34
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,633
All right. Let's see.

35
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,219
You guys are brave.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,055
Both the teacher

37
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,932
and the student.

38
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,169
Hi, Ha-young.

39
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,506
Long time no see.
How did you know I was back here?

40
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,177
I was discharged a few days ago,
then I got admitted again yesterday.

41
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,892
Ms. Moon told us to submit
the university and major of our choice

42
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,310
with our career prospects.

DESIRED UNIVERSITY SURVEY

44
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,316
I don't need it.

45
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,781
This is a math worksheet.

46
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,367
We'll cover one more course
with this for CSAT.

47
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,787
I even wrote down the processes and notes,
so take a look.

48
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,540
I don't need it.

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,376
I'm studying plenty of stuff
with my tutor.

50
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,672
You really don't need it?

51
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,634
No, I don't.

52
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,532
Jeez.

53
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,579
That temper of hers.

54
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,250
I'm the only one who put up with it.

55
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,963
What did you just say?

56
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,341
I won't go to KEIST.

57
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,053
I applied there
because you wanted it so badly.

58
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,805
Even if I get accepted,

59
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,015
I won't go there.

60
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,684
Then what do you want to do?

61
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,479
It will be nice to major in Mathematics
and be a professor.

62
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,772
I want to go to medical school.

63
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,360
Heon.

64
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,863
Don't you know what your dad went through?

65
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,281
It's my life.

66
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,452
I'll decide what to do with it.

67
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,040
Heon.

68
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,268
God, this is exhausting.

69
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,783
Why are you here?

70
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,703
What are you doing?

71
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,289
Ha-young ripped this to pieces

72
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,874
because I made her angry.

73
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,376
Will you give up like this?

74
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,673
Give up what?

75
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,966
Ha-young.

76
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,685
How can I like someone like this?

77
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,229
I could faint any moment.

78
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,398
-I can't be with her.
-That's--

79
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,733
What about you?

80
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,069
Do you know how much time
Sol-i spent whining here?

81
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:47,532
She whined as if KEIST was in the States,
not in Daejeon.

82
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,911
-How was the early admission interview?
-I'll probably pass.

83
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,538
You're so full of yourself.

84
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,916
I won't go there.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,502
What? You won't go there?

86
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,212
Really? Why not?

87
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,048
I'll go to medical school.

88
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,759
You're something else.

89
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,927
Also,

90
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,097
I want to be by Sol-i's side.

91
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,516
What?

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,518
You're not Heon. Who are you?

93
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,145
Bring Heon back.

94
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,732
So you shouldn't avoid Ha-young, either.

95
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,084
Trigonometric functions
are variations of formulas.

96
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,964
It seems difficult, but it's easy
when you think of the law of cosines.

97
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,507
Okay.

98
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,550
Solve it on your own.

99
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,302
Okay.

100
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,166
Tell me when you're done.

101
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,502
Okay.

102
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,806
What are you doing?

103
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
Well…

104
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,436
I…

105
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:27,817
Will you believe me if I say
I was only trying to wipe the sweat?

106
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,111
off your face?

107
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,085
If you stop chewing your pencil,

108
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,628
I'll believe you.

109
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,050
Hey, Dae-sung.

110
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,721
Hi, Brother.

111
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,181
Did you just finish training?

112
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,559
Yes.

113
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,270
One second.

114
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,105
SAEMAEUM NURSING HOME

115
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,023
Hello?

116
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,359
Grandma disappeared?

117
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,612
I'll be right there.

118
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,364
Let's go.

119
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,617
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

120
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,454
We'll go this way.

121
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,539
-Thanks.
-No problem.

122
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,374
Grandma!

123
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,628
Grandma!

124
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,758
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

125
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,888
Did you see an old lady around here
by any chance?

126
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,640
She's about my height
and her hair is bobbed.

127
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:23,766
No, we haven't.

128
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,895
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

129
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,899
Grandma!

130
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,109
Gran…

131
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,163
Is that her?

132
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,207
What? Yes!

133
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,611
Grandma. Put these on.

134
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,952
Thank you.

135
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,454
By the way, young man,

136
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,249
when will my Dae-sung get here?

137
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,510
He'll be here soon.

138
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,554
He must be hungry.

139
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,057
I'm hungry, too.

140
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,061
Grandma, I want to have kimchi stew.

141
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,149
My Dae-sung likes kimchi stew, too.

142
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,528
I want to make it for him often,

143
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,614
but he's too busy
with his swimming practice,

144
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,492
so I rarely see him.

145
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,997
He is

146
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,001
going to be become a world champion.

147
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,009
What's wrong, young man?

148
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,011
Are you starving?

149
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,723
I'll prepare a meal for you.

150
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,320
Thanks.

151
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,825
Are you okay?

152
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,870
Yes.

153
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,958
Heon,

154
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,086
I'm

155
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,299
going to start over.

156
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,515
Swimming. I'm talking about swimming.

157
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,060
I see.

158
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,523
Anyway,

159
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,151
I'll make Grandma's wish come true.

160
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,820
Okay.

161
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,198
Good luck.

162
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,037
What will you do?

163
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,708
I won't go to KEIST.

164
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,213
Honestly, I hoped you'd go there.

165
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:42,882
What?

166
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,842
Anyway, that's good news.

167
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,179
Take good care of Brother.

168
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,895
Don't lower your guard.

169
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,940
If you give Sol-i a hard time,
I'll come running.

170
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,901
Then we won't see each other.

171
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,697
Because I won't give her a hard time.

172
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,786
Man, what a jerk.

173
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,176
MILKY SKIN WOO DAE-SANG

174
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,098
<i>Meet me in the school backyard.</i>

175
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,766
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

176
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
Sol-i.

177
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,479
Hey.

178
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,358
This is

179
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,527
where we first met.

180
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,112
Do you remember?

181
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,991
Yes. You're right.

182
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,621
Who knew this school was so scary?

183
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,123
Must one be ready to offer up a leg?

184
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,211
That's right. This school is the scariest

185
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,378
and so am I.

186
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,342
Sol-i.

187
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,220
I like you

188
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:53,971
a lot.

189
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,937
-Dae-sung--
-One more thing.

190
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:03,981
Ths.

191
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,573
Look. Saved by my t-shirt, right?

192
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,743
When I first saw you,

193
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,913
I just thought you were cute.

194
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,750
But before I knew it,
I started having feelings for you

195
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,505
ever since you came to watch me swim.

196
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,382
Dae-sung, good job!

197
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,676
You're the best!

198
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,511
<i>I loved the way you smiled.</i>

199
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,849
<i>So I wore the bear costume
and ran alongside you.</i>

200
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,060
<i>I sprayed snow on Christmas Day.</i>

201
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,453
Sol-i.

202
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,582
Look at me.

203
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,168
Dae-sung.

204
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,921
From now on…

205
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,049
I won't like you anymore.

206
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,470
I'm sorry.

207
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,348
Don't be.

208
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,268
I was happy every day.

209
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:23,978
Truly.

210
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,151
Thank you

211
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,486

212
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,288
Goodbye,

your ID, or your pen,

217
