1
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:13,461
Do you want to know...

2
00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:16,061
why I hired you at that time?

3
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:19,502
Pardon me?

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,601
Yes.

5
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:46,761
Because you are Mi So.

6
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,901
Because you are Kim Mi So.

7
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:04,841
What do you mean?

8
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:09,521
Did you know me prior to the interview, by any chance?

9
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:14,521
Of course not.

10
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,392
I was always curious about why I was hired.

11
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:22,502
When I was working as a temp worker in the General Affairs Department,

12
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:25,672
my senior suggested that I apply for that overseas secretary job.

13
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,032
I never thought that I'd be chosen,

14
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:29,601
so I was shocked when I was.

15
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:34,672
I want to know what you mean by that.

16
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,351
There's no other special reason.

17
00:01:40,452 --> 00:01:42,622
Like I said, I hired you because you're Kim Mi So.

18
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:48,351
Because Kim Mi So...

19
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:54,892
was the one with the least impressive credentials.

20
00:01:57,362 --> 00:01:59,372
- What? - I was choosing someone...

21
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:01,931
who'd go to the U.S. with me and undergo a lot of difficulties.

22
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:04,301
And I didn't think overly qualified people could handle it.

23
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:08,271
That's why I chose the person with the least impressive credentials.

24
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,681
Someone who would never be scouted by another company...

25
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:12,711
or quit.

26
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:19,422
And here I thought that there was some other special reason.

27
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,211
I'll be heading home now.

28
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:42,311
Did you...

29
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:46,051
have a good time discussing old times with my brother?

30
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:52,692
I saw you two together earlier.

31
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,162
How does it feel to finally meet the boy that you'd been looking for?

32
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:07,672
I'm happy to see him.

33
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:12,102
But honestly, it still feels surreal.

34
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,341
I see.

35
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,621
I'm sure...

36
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:26,452
that you heard about what happened to me too, then.

37
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:30,922
About how that happened to my older brother...

38
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:33,862
because I left him behind there.

39
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:38,732
Yes.

40
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:43,001
I also heard that you lost all of your memories of that time.

41
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,751
The fact that you lost your memories of that time,

42
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:54,612
probably means it was so hard on you...

43
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,621
that you wanted to forget it all.

44
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:04,222
So don't blame yourself.

45
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:15,102
I'll really be going now. See you tomorrow.

46
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:56,811
(To That Boy)

47
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:05,652
(I played hide-and-seek with my sisters at the playground today.)

48
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:07,191
(I lost at rock-paper- scissors, so I was the seeker.)

49
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,451
(But I found both of my sisters.)

50
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,191
(They say it's no fun to play with me since I'm so good at seeking.)

51
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,362
(I'll be a good seeker, and definitely find that boy.)

52
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,741
(Resume)

53
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:33,011
Did you know me prior to the interview, by any chance?

54
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:36,121
Here you go.

55
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:38,051
- Do you have a high tolerance? - No, not at all.

56
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,321
- Just make her drink anyway. - Really, I...

57
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:41,821
- For Ms. Kim! - For Ms. Kim!

58
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,561
- For Ms. Kim! - For Ms. Kim!

59
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:44,991
I'll be looking forward to working with you.

60
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:46,061
Yes, me too.

61
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,061
Mr. Lee?

62
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:50,662
Mr. Lee?

63
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:53,801
Yes, is there something you needed to tell me?

64
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,201
Well...

65
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:58,501
you don't need to attend your subordinates' staff dinner.

66
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:02,612
No, attending staff dinners will also help me gain insight.

67
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:07,751
I'm glad that I came.

68
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:10,582
Cheers.

69
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:14,821
Stop it, punk.

70
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:24,801
What's your name?

71
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:27,801
I'm Kim Mi So.

72
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:34,612
- Ms. Kim Mi So. - Yes?

73
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:36,342
Do you know who I am?

74
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,152
Yes, you're the chairman's son.

75
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,691
Am I wrong?

76
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:50,922
No, you're correct.

77
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,561
I see.

78
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,362
- Here, Ms. Mi So. - All right.

79
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,172
- I'll do my best! - Cheers!

80
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:01,672
Goodness.

81
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:05,772
(Senior Managing Director Lee Young Joon)

82
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:06,912
Everything looks great.

83
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:12,212
About my selection for my overseas secretary...

84
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:16,582
I know that there's a temp worker in General Affairs right now.

85
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:19,222
Tell her to apply too.

86
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:21,321
Yes, sir.

87
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,441
Hello, Senior Managing Director.

88
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,612
My name is Kim Mi So, and I will be starting today...

89
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:44,982
as your secretary.

90
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:47,381
I will work hard. I look forward to working with you.

91
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:50,321
Yes, Ms. Kim Mi So. I look forward to working with you too.

92
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:55,092
You can raise your head now.

93
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,321
Pardon?

94
00:07:58,191 --> 00:07:59,232
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:18,912
(Episode 7)

96
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,412
It wasn't Young Joon, but his brother?

97
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,922
Yes. His older brother was the boy whom I was looking for.

98
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,562
Are you disappointed by that?

99
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:38,131
Pardon? What do you mean?

100
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:40,671
Well, the person you were looking for all this time...

101
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,541
wasn't Young Joon, but his older brother.

102
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,442
And you seem disappointed by that.

103
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:46,812
I do?

104
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,781
No, not at all.

105
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:54,052
At any rate, I figured I should tell you to set the record straight.

106
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:57,052
So please continue to act as if you don't know about this to Mr. Lee.

107
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:00,891
I'll be going now.

108
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:11,562
So it wasn't Young Joon, but his older brother?

109
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:15,232
I feel like Young Joon is being pushed aside a bit.

110
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,612
Yes, Director Choi?

111
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:23,281
Lunch today?

112
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:25,011
I can't.

113
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:27,112
Unfortunately, I think my morning meeting will drag on a lot.

114
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:29,582
Yes. Yes, all right.

115
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:33,291
Where are the materials?

116
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:34,952
Ms. Seol?

117
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:37,391
Ms. Seol!

118
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:39,962
Ms. Seol!

119
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:47,771
Gosh, I'm so tired.

120
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,001
I just want to get some rest tomorrow.

121
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:53,241
I know, right? Why are we having a weekend workshop?

122
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:55,612
Still, it's just once a year.

123
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:58,682
So we should attend for the sake of our team's harmony and unity.

124
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:01,112
Also, the art center...

125
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:03,682
is a project that the vice chairman is paying special attention to.

126
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,891
So imagine how happy he'll be...

127
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:09,491
if we show him we're being considerate of that.

128
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,521
He'll be rendered speechless.

129
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:14,962
Okay?

130
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:20,302
Anyway, just write that down on the schedule.

131
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:23,842
But we'll go somewhere with fresh air,

132
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:26,671
and enjoy some alcohol.

133
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:28,612
We'll also get tons of rest,

134
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:30,842
and have a good time. Just think of it like that.

135
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:33,812
I bet the drinks will taste really good...

136
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:35,212
if you drink it at a place with fresh air.

137
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,281
That's right.

138
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:37,952
I want to go too.

139
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:39,452
Don't be down, Ms. Seol.

140
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,291
Come with us.

141
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:42,991
- Really? - Yes.

142
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:45,222
I'll do the grocery shopping too, then.

143
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:46,491
I'll buy the alcohol and meat.

144
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:50,562
This is the first time I've seen Ms. Seol take the initiative.

145
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:55,271
Is Ms. Seol here by any chance? Oh, here she is.

146
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,442
I was looking all over for you.

147
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:01,472
- Why didn't you call me? - You left your cellphone behind.

148
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:04,281
So what did you need me for?

149
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:05,312
I have a meeting later,

150
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:07,781
so I need you to get me the accounting inspection report.

151
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:09,322
Sir,

152
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:10,952
that's due this Friday.

153
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:12,121
Today is...

154
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,291
Friday, right?

155
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,791
- That's right. - Right.

156
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,891
It's Friday.

157
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,291
Gosh, is it Friday today?

158
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,991
- I'll see you tomorrow then. - Bye.

159
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:26,271
Gosh, you must be utterly fazed.

160
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:27,401
No.

161
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:30,072
I'm used to seeing her make one mistake a day.

162
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:31,442
It's not even surprising.

163
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:32,612
See you, then.

164
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:38,982
- Mistake. - He said mistake.

165
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:46,121
Son, when will you spend time with your mom?

166
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,822
You were out all day yesterday too.

167
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:51,391
I'm sorry. I had to meet someone important.

168
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:53,062
Someone important?

169
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:00,771
Is it your girlfriend?

170
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,271
Well,

171
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,702
that could be the case.

172
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,541
Again? You playboy.

173
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:08,011
It's different this time.

174
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:12,612
I've finally met my fate after all this time.

175
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:21,491
Maybe it's because he's a writer, but all his words are romantic.

176
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:26,332
I feel like we're destined together too.

177
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:28,962
We've finally met each other after all the time.

178
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,901
I wish we never met each other.

179
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,521
Yes, hello.

180
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:00,791
What? Lunch?

181
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,702
We didn't get to talk much because it was too sudden yesterday.

182
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:07,472
It seems like we have a lot to talk about.

183
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,322
This is the report on your weekly business.

184
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,161
And...

185
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,531
And?

186
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:35,761
Ji Ah is going to accompany you for the buyer meeting with UK Group.

187
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:37,802
You have no other special schedule than that.

188
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,401
May I have my lunch separately?

189
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:45,371
Do you have any appointments?

190
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:50,482
Mr. Lee Sung Yeon asked me to have lunch together.

191
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:57,822
Do that.

192
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:59,822
Okay, sir.

193
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,771
Did you sleep well last night?

194
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:18,401
I couldn't.

195
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:20,041
Pardon?

196
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:24,241
I couldn't sleep.

197
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:29,222
I wasn't alone in that dark and scary place...

198
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:31,052
at that time.

199
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:33,891
All kinds of feelings went through me.

200
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:36,421
I was surprised too.

201
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:39,631
The one I searched for a long time turned out to be so close to me.

202
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:47,202
What did you want to do the most when you found me?

203
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:51,671
You said you looked for me for a long time.

204
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:55,911
I don't know.

205
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:59,781
I just wanted to find you. That was all.

206
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,222
Was it like first love?

207
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,722
Well, not exactly.

208
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,991
I may not be your first love,

209
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:15,862
but you'll still help me find my memory back, right?

210
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,582
Sir, what brings you here?

211
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,852
That's what I want to ask.

212
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,151
Did you forget about the meeting with UK Group?

213
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,491
I told you a while ago...

214
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:41,391
- that Ji Ah would accompany... - It's been your job,

215
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,621
so you should go with me this time as well.

216
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,421
They care about security matters,

217
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,891
so they prefer to have meetings with the same people.

218
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:48,631
You're aware of that.

219
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,302
Do they?

220
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:53,932
Yes.

221
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,442
I'll have to leave you then.

222
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:00,842
Okay, Mi So. I'll see you later.

223
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,541
Wait for me in the car for a second.

224
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:09,251
Okay.

225
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:21,832
Don't see her from now on.

226
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:24,401
Don't butt in our business.

227
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:26,531
"Our business"?

228
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,271
Those words...

229
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:32,102
can be used only between people like me and her.

230
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:35,612
We've adjusted ourselves to each other for nine years.

231
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,011
You know what?

232
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:45,222
In fact, Mi So looked for me for more than nine years.

233
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,822
She yearned to meet me for a long time.

234
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:52,261
We finally reunited because of her desperate wish.

235
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,491
We're destined to each other.

236
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,302
Are you writing a novel?

237
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,631
Is it part of your new book?

238
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:04,871
In that case, it's too obvious to have it come true.

239
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:06,342
I don't know.

240
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:10,612
We'll see whether it becomes true or not.

241
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:22,461
He said, "See you later," earlier.

242
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:24,562
What does that mean?

243
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:29,701
I'm going to go to the redevelopment district with him after work.

244
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,272
The redevelopment district?

245
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:35,201
Yes.

246
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:37,201
We can't go to where I actually lived...

247
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:40,012
because it's already become part of Yumyung Land.

248
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:43,282
We wondered if it'd be good to go somewhere similar.

249
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:47,151
He might remember something then.

250
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:52,951
The writer too, but I also want to regain my old memories.

251
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,092
No, don't go.

252
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:58,862
Don't go.

253
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:08,901
I want to go.

254
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,002
I have a lot of things which I want to know too.

255
00:18:20,951 --> 00:18:23,421
By the way, I'm so full.

256
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,252
I finished two bowls because that rich soybean past stew was so great.

257
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,492
I'm so full.

258
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:31,362
- You did eat a lot. - Right.

259
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,661
- Hello. - Hello.

260
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,532
Are you back from your lunch?

261
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,332
Yes, we're on our back from having some salads.

262
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:48,272
Is that your lunch?

263
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:49,711
That's not good.

264
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,151
Your stomach has to fully stuffed.

265
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:54,552
I like to have my brain stuffed...

266
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:56,621
instead of having my stomach stuffed.

267
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:59,891
It's better to use my lunchtime to have a better grasp of my work.

268
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:06,231
Speaking of which, we're going to a workshop tomorrow.

269
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:07,762
Will you join us?

270
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:08,961
What are you talking about?

271
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:10,602
No, thank you.

272
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,572
I'm busy, so please excuse me.

273
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:16,272
Hello, Mr. Ko Gui Nam.

274
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:20,842
You know, I've heard the news.

275
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:24,042
- What news? - I heard...

276
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:27,752
you last a week only with that.

277
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:31,022
Did you end up telling others about my secret?

278
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,492
Excuse me?

279
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:33,891
I didn't hear this from Ji Ah.

280
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:36,961
And that shouldn't even be a secret.

281
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:40,691
Wait a minute.

282
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,362
Are you scared I might take it from you?

283
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:47,832
I have a lot of heat in my body, so I can't have it anyway.

284
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,272
What are you talking about?

285
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:54,641
My dear Gui Nam.

286
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:56,711
I thought it was strange of you...

287
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:59,211
to stand all your overtime working.

288
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,552
I heard it was thanks to...

289
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:04,881
the ginseng juice sent from your mother, right?

290
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:07,691
I heard you lasted a week thanks to that juice.

291
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:14,292
So you were talking about that ginseng juice.

292
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:16,062
Goodness.

293
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:18,002
Don't tell me...

294
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:20,931
you're hiding another secret.

295
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:24,342
- No, it was about the juice. - Right?

296
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,242
You better call your mother often.

297
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:31,381
I guess I should join your workshop...

298
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:33,711
for the sake of work understanding.

299
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:35,252
Great.

300
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:44,461
Goodness, what's wrong with him?

301
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,772
Sir, you haven't forgotten about today's dinner meeting, right?

302
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,411
Secretary Yang will accompany you.

303
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,552
What about you?

304
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,951
You're going to regain your memory with your dear old friend?

305
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,082
Pardon?

306
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,151
Well, yes.

307
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:16,862
Don't go. Don't go.

308
00:21:21,391 --> 00:21:22,461
Don't go.

309
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:29,102
I'll leave you then.

310
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,082
Where does she think she'll leave?

311
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:41,012
Leave for her good old memories?

312
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:45,151
She should put more effort into making memories with me instead.

313
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:54,832
Yes, I just finished work. I'll take a cab...

314
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:10,312
What's gotten into you?

315
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:12,852
You canceled your social meeting for a workout?

316
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:16,352
I'm not in the mood for silly talks today.

317
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:18,381
Did something happen?

318
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:21,621
I don't know.

319
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:37,971
Guess who?

320
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:40,042
What do you think you're doing?

321
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,542
Get your hands off.

322
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,181
Guess who I am?

323
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:48,481
If you don't get your hands off of me right now,

324
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:50,681
you'll have to remove your stuff from your office...

325
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:54,421
No way. No way. Guess who I am?

326
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:06,772
"Guess who"?

327
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,102
Did you think I wouldn't know who you were?

328
00:23:10,342 --> 00:23:12,572
You may think you know everything about me,

329
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:15,342
but you may actually not.

330
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:18,411
- What? - I'm not just your friend.

331
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:20,481
I'm your best friend...

332
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:22,951
who doesn't want to see you hurt.

333
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:40,802
It's the most similar place.

334
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:42,901
What do you think? Do you remember anything?

335
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:44,941
I'm not sure.

336
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:51,112
The woman who kidnapped us was the mistress of a married man.

337
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:54,711
After getting an abortion, she was told to break up unilaterally.

338
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:57,421
She kidnapped us out of anger.

339
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,362
Right, now that you told me so,

340
00:24:02,362 --> 00:24:04,862
there seemed to be someone else other than us at that time.

341
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:07,631
By the way,

342
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:10,731
do you remember how we got out of that house?

343
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:15,032
I'm not sure,

344
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:18,201
but I remember how we held our hands together...

345
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,481
and got out of there. You walked me home too.

346
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:24,342
I walked you home?

347
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:33,421
By the way,

348
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:36,221
how did you call me back then?

349
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:39,562
I called you by your name.

350
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,762
Can't you call me that way again?

351
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:46,302
I'll talk casually to you too.

352
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:27,312
Young Joon, you silly. What's up with your kicks?

353
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:31,881
You have to stretch your leg a little more to make it look edgy.

354
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:33,612
You need some lessons.

355
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:41,592
How about we do sparring?

356
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:56,871
I'm sorry.

357
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:07,812
What's wrong? You look so upset.

358
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:11,451
There's something which I don't want to get taken away.

359
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:14,792
Right, you shouldn't get...

360
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:16,961
Ms. Kim taken away.

361
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:23,762
What are you talking about? This isn't about Ms. Kim.

362
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:27,072
Stop it, you cheeky owner.

363
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:29,542
Until when will you make up stories about your cousin and colleague...

364
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,502
and beat around the bush?

365
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:35,012
Trust me and confess already.

366
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,082
Be a man and babble about.

367
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:43,621
- Well... - Enough of your excuses.

368
00:26:44,822 --> 00:26:47,721
Go profess your feelings to her right now.

369
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:50,492
You and Ms. Kim shouldn't be flirting with each other forever.

370
00:26:51,221 --> 00:26:53,461
- What, flirting? - Then what is it between you?

371
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:55,562
You guys have feelings for each other, but you're not dating.

372
00:26:55,562 --> 00:26:57,832
Is there a better word to describe it other than flirting?

373
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:05,171
Go now.

374
00:27:05,342 --> 00:27:09,282
Go get her heart right now. Don't forget who you are.

375
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:11,812
Whether it's an object or a person, you always got what you wanted.

376
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:13,881
You're the real tough cookie.

377
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:17,282
- "Cookie"? - I take it back.

378
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:19,421
You can do it, boss.

379
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:28,131
It's the journal which you asked me for.

380
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:34,332
(To my dear friend)

381
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:35,502
(My daddy got me caramels today.)

382
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:39,612
I hope it's helpful for you to find your memories.

383
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:46,881
Actually, I've blamed Young Joon a lot in my life.

384
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:49,822
If not for him,

385
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,052
I wouldn't have experienced such a thing.

386
00:27:54,951 --> 00:27:56,921
But those feelings are disappearing a little...

387
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:00,231
to think that you were with me that day.

388
00:28:01,032 --> 00:28:02,161
What?

389
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,231
We can share what happened together like this.

390
00:28:04,762 --> 00:28:07,631
Now, I'm even thankful to him.

391
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:15,911
Give me a second.

392
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:19,352
Hello, sir.

393
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,951
What, emergency?

394
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:47,441
You didn't have to give her a ride.

395
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:51,812
Oh, no. You know I'm quite a gentleman.

396
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:53,981
Then why don't you leave like a gentleman?

397
00:28:54,252 --> 00:28:57,252
We're a bit busy here due to the emergency in the company.

398
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:00,191
You're having a lot of emergency situations today.

399
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:02,661
Is it because the vice chairman is incompetent?

400
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:04,262
It's the other way around.

401
00:29:04,562 --> 00:29:07,092
The vice chairman is too competent that he always gets attacked.

402
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:11,802
Do you not know how it feels to get attacked for being too competent?

403
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:21,842
You must be busy. Please go now.

404
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:24,782
Okay. I'll call you, Mi So.

405
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:27,411
All right. Drive safely, Sung Yeon.

406
00:29:28,052 --> 00:29:29,582
"Sung Yeon"?

407
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:48,032
How could you easily call him by his name?

408
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:51,441
Well, we aren't colleagues at work.

409
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:55,211
What?

410
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,042
- Let's go in quickly. - Wait.

411
00:29:59,612 --> 00:30:01,951
- There's no need to. - What?

412
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:04,282
I'm hungry. Make me some ramen.

413
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:05,921
It's urgent that I'm hungry.

414
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:08,651
- What... - Who am I?

415
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:12,191
I'm responsible for every decision made in Yumyung Group.

416
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:13,362
I may affect...

417
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:16,631
the lives of its employees and their families too.

418
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:19,102
- And? - And I...

419
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:21,371
can't focus on work because I'm missing ramen.

420
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:23,572
What more can be urgent than this?

421
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,742
So I want ramen right now.

422
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:44,221
This isn't the noodles that I wanted.

423
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:46,292
This isn't the situation that I wanted either.

424
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,661
- What do you keep interrupting us? - What?

425
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:53,731
You showed up whenever I was with the writer.

426
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:55,431
That's something called interrupting.

427
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:01,441
I'm aware that you aren't on good terms with him.

428
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,481
- But I must find my old memories... - Bury your old memories.

429
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:07,151
- Pardon me? - We all should live for the future.

430
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:09,381
Until when are you going to let such old memories bog you down?

431
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:12,492
It's all in the past. Does it still matter to you that much?

432
00:31:13,092 --> 00:31:15,822
Does it matter enough to upset a guy whom you've been flirting with?

433
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:20,562
What... "Flirting"?

434
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:21,731
That's right.

435
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:23,332
The word itself lacks any sense of seriousness,

436
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:25,871
but there's no better word that encapsulates those subtle feelings.

437
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:28,701
I like you, and you like me as well.

438
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:31,641
We've been flirting. Am I wrong?

439
00:31:33,211 --> 00:31:34,312
Well, it's...

440
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:36,711
You admit it too, right?

441
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:38,312
We're flirting with each other.

442
00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:41,211
But what?

443
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:42,752
Your childhood sweetheart?

444
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:45,022
You want to find out more about your old memories?

445
00:31:45,121 --> 00:31:46,621
Have some manners, will you?

446
00:31:47,022 --> 00:31:48,391
Here are your dumplings.

447
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,992
We'd like another bowl of ramen, please.

448
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:01,971
I don't think this is the right place for this kind of conversation.

449
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,542
You're the one who brought me here.

450
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:13,566

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

451
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:20,792
Ms. Kim.

452
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,332
I'm smart, handsome,

453
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:29,062
filthy rich, and competent.

454
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,131
So please...

455
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:33,772
stop rejecting me and just marry me.

456
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,302
This time...

457
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:40,542
it's different from last time me asking you to get together.

458
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:42,911
Back then...

459
00:32:44,812 --> 00:32:46,881
Yes, I admit that I did it because I didn't want you to quit,

460
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,082
but things have changed now.

461
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:51,522
I really mean it.

462
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:56,191
So let's...

463
00:32:57,322 --> 00:33:00,032
quit this game and really start dating now.

464
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,681
I don't think that's right.

465
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:20,052
What do you mean?

466
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:22,752
Haven't we been flirting?

467
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:24,221
Yes, we have.

468
00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:26,721
Then why... Why don't you want to date me?

469
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:30,461
You just blurted that out of jealousy...

470
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:31,822
and not wanting to lose.

471
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:33,592
I don't want to start a relationship this way.

472
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:35,931
This vibe and this situation.

473
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:37,401
I don't like it.

474
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:40,901
What?

475
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:44,671
Anyway, I don't think now is a good time.

476
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:45,671
I'm off.

477
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:50,012
No, it has to be now. Now is the right time!

478
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:02,562
How many times has she dumped me so far?

479
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,802
Why does he have to ask me out like that every single time?

480
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:27,211
- Keep going. - Oh, boy.

481
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:34,892
Ms. Seol, I heard that you were the first to arrive today.

482
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:38,392
Yes. Even back in school, I was always late for my classes,

483
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:41,392
but I made sure to arrive first when we were going on field trips.

484
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:43,262
I don't think it's something to brag about.

485
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:45,061
Ms. Seol, did you get all the groceries we need?

486
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:47,372
Meat! We have to have meat for the barbecue.

487
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:51,202
Ta-da!

488
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:55,581
I wasn't sure what you guys would like,

489
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,182
so I bought all kinds of meat,

490
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,782
from pork belly, neck meat,

491
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:01,351
and Boston butt to skirt meat all from Korean pork,

492
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:03,151
so that you guys can pick and choose.

493
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,282
Did you buy veggies too?

494
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:07,251
Ta-da!

495
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:10,622
What about alcohol?

496
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:12,691
Ta-da!

497
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:15,162
- Oh, my! - Awesome!

498
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:18,461
It's perfect.

499
00:35:18,762 --> 00:35:21,472
Look at you. You do your job so well when it's not really about work.

500
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:24,642
Totally. Had you worked this hard,

501
00:35:24,642 --> 00:35:27,342
you would've made it to Ms. Kim's level a long time ago.

502
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:29,912
I know, right?

503
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:33,682
My goodness. You always say the right things.

504
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:34,751
Hello.

505
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:43,762
Mr. Ko.

506
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:47,231
You're wearing that suit to the workshop?

507
00:35:47,432 --> 00:35:51,131
Oh, I believe that the workshop is an extension of the work we do.

508
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:54,472
Right, I only have one suit.

509
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:55,972
But why is that any of your business?

510
00:35:56,271 --> 00:35:58,202
Well, it looks like everyone is here now.

511
00:35:58,202 --> 00:36:00,072
- Shall we get going, then? - Sounds great!

512
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,242
- Let's go! - Let's put everything in the car.

513
00:36:03,742 --> 00:36:05,851
- All right, guys. - I'll take care of this.

514
00:36:07,012 --> 00:36:10,282
Ms. Kim, do you know why I'm going to the workshop?

515
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:11,751
Sorry?

516
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:14,691
Well, I guess you want to see the art center on the way back.

517
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:15,691
No.

518
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:17,762
I'm only going because I must keep an eye on you.

519
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:18,932
What?

520
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:21,331
You know that I only have one suit...

521
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:22,862
and how pathetic my tiny apartment is...

522
00:36:23,162 --> 00:36:25,472
I mean, I don't want you to tell everyone about how frugal I am.

523
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:29,171
But why can't people find out? Is it that big of a deal to you?

524
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:30,842
Yes, it is a huge deal.

525
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,572
People think I'm a hot workaholic guy,

526
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:34,041
and I've been named...

527
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,941
the most attractive male employee in the company.

528
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:38,012
I absolutely do not want to ruin that public image of mine.

529
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:39,351
So you'd better...

530
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:47,722
You two, get in the car already.

531
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,521
Okay, we're coming.

532
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:54,131
- There you are. - Yes.

533
00:37:02,702 --> 00:37:03,802
What's with him?

534
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:10,912
(Gapyeong Rest Stop)

535
00:37:12,512 --> 00:37:15,251
We have to eat these snacks at rest stops.

536
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:17,751
Mr. Ko, why aren't you eating?

537
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:18,791
Are you on a diet?

538
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:21,351
Yes, stop working already and have some of this.

539
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:22,421
It's really good.

540
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:23,992
- It's okay... - Come on. Try it.

541
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,662
Just try it, please. Oh, no!

542
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:28,131
My gosh!

543
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:30,831
Goodness!

544
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,702
This is the only suit I have.

545
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:34,202
- Darn it. - Come again?

546
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:36,342
Do you only own this one suit?

547
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:37,742
I thought you had 10 of the same suit.

548
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:42,381
Yes, I do own 10 of this,

549
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:45,381
but I care for each one of them as if it's the only suit I own.

550
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:47,081
Oh, I see.

551
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:50,722
Please take this off. I'll wipe it off for you.

552
00:37:50,722 --> 00:37:52,151
Oh, sorry... My apologies.

553
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:53,592
All right.

554
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:57,392
It took you so long.

555
00:37:57,392 --> 00:37:59,362
I kept debating between udon and ramen.

556
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:00,432
I was like, "Udon or ramen?"

557
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:02,501
That's why I took so long.

558
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:05,532
You should all try mine.

559
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:07,202
- Here you go. - Oh, my.

560
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,171
"Do you want to come up for a bowl of ramen?"

561
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:15,682
Gosh, that's what women say when they want to seduce men.

562
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:19,052
Oh, that's right. That line is synonymous with seduction.

563
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:20,081
- Right? - Yes.

564
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:24,182
Do you want to stay for a bowl of ramen?

565
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:25,992
Ramen?

566
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:28,961
Since when offering someone a bowl of ramen...

567
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:30,421
had such a connotation?

568
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:34,231
The person could just literally be offering a bowl of ramen.

569
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:39,802
I was just joking.

570
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:41,671
Why are you getting so worked up, Ms. Kim?

571
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,541
Did I just get worked up?

572
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:51,441
No, I'm totally cool.

573
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:55,921
You scared me for a second.

574
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:02,561
- You got me worried. - Same here.

575
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:06,492
- All right, let's eat! - Let's dig in.

576
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:29,822
What?

577
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:32,122
She thinks I blurted it out because I'm jealous...

578
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:33,892
and I don't want to lose?

579
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:39,061
I meant every word I said, and yet she took it the wrong way.

580
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,182
What is this?

581
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:03,822
- I'll show you how it works. - Okay.

582
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:05,282
First, take a selfie.

583
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:10,561
Then do this and choose what you want. After that...

584
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:12,362
- It's done. - Oh, my.

585
00:40:13,731 --> 00:40:15,501
- Then it becomes like this. - My gosh!

586
00:40:15,662 --> 00:40:17,061
After that... Look, okay?

587
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:19,802
Hi.

588
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:21,432
I'm Ji Ah.

589
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:26,311
Now, I'll send it to you.

590
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:27,311
- Did you send it? - Yes.

591
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:29,282
- Let's see. Show me! - Open it.

592
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:33,052
Hi. I'm Ji Ah.

593
00:40:33,952 --> 00:40:36,452
- This is so awesome. - She looks just like you, Ji Ah.

594
00:40:36,822 --> 00:40:37,921
This is really cool.

595
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:39,492
- Isn't it fun? - Yes, totally.

596
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:44,291
By the way, can we really be just hanging out like this?

597
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:45,992
According to the schedule,

598
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:47,992
we should be presenting our visions now.

599
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:50,461
We made the schedule only because we had to submit it to the higher-ups.

600
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:52,472
- Aren't I right, Ms. Kim? - Yes, she's right.

601
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:55,231
Just think that you're on vacation and get as much rest as you can.

602
00:40:57,302 --> 00:40:59,872
I wish I could do nothing and just chill like this every day.

603
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:03,112
- Me too. Hanging out is the best. - Me too.

604
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:10,351
What's going on? Are you two drinking already?

605
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:12,452
Yes. Drinking in the afternoon...

606
00:41:12,452 --> 00:41:14,552
is the best, you know.

607
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:16,892
Come on. We want to join too.

608
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:19,092
Let's start a party.

609
00:41:19,162 --> 00:41:21,262
I saw a creek nearby on our way here.

610
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:23,762
Why don't we go there so that we can have conversations...

611
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:26,501
and also drink together? What do you think?

612
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:31,041
No, I think we should exchange information about the art center.

613
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,142
Let's go, guys. To the creek!

614
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:35,782
- Let's go! - Let's go!

615
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:37,581
Go, team!

616
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,151
- Here we come! - Go, go!

617
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:42,452
- Seriously? - We need the cooler. Where is it?

618
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:43,822
My gosh, it'll be so good.

619
00:41:46,822 --> 00:41:49,122
Oh, my. The air is so fresh!

620
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:51,561
I know, right? It's really nice to be away from the city.

621
00:41:52,061 --> 00:41:53,731
I'm so glad all of you guys could make it.

622
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:59,001
Wow, it's been ages since the last time I saw a fumigation truck.

623
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:01,771
Ms. Kim, do people in your generation know about that truck?

624
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:04,302
Back in the old days, kids came out...

625
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:06,711
whenever they heard that truck and followed it around...

626
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:08,881
to smell the fumes on purpose.

627
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:41,012
- Gosh, the fumes... - It's burning my nose.

628
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:43,481
My eyes are stinging. My goodness.

629
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:44,541
Let's walk fast.

630
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:03,432
Mr. Lee, what brings you here?

631
00:43:03,662 --> 00:43:05,061
I came all the way here...

632
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:11,472
because of Mr. Yang.

633
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:17,441
He's also a member of the team,

634
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:19,512
so he obviously has to participate in the workshop as well.

635
00:43:21,512 --> 00:43:24,581
Then he could've come alone.

636
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:26,151
I was going to send him alone,

637
00:43:26,552 --> 00:43:29,362
but all of you, who work so hard for me, are here,

638
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:32,731
so I thought it'd be meaningful for me to participate as well.

639
00:43:33,762 --> 00:43:37,162
Sir, does that mean you'll stay here for two days...

640
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,072
with us?

641
00:43:41,072 --> 00:43:44,541
That's right. As you're all aware, the team isn't complete...

642
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:47,541
without me.

643
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:53,811
- Yes! - We're honored!

644
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:55,211
What an honor.

645
00:43:55,381 --> 00:43:56,822
- We'd love that. - We're truly honored.

646
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:59,052
- You're more than welcome here. - We're very honored.

647
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:00,291
This is great!

648
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:03,322
Are you going somewhere?

649
00:44:03,322 --> 00:44:05,021
We're on our way to the creek to drink...

650
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:07,061
No, sir. We just bought this watermelon,

651
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,831
and we were on our way back to the guest house.

652
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,101
- Yes. - When we're back,

653
00:44:10,802 --> 00:44:13,331
we're going to present our vision statements.

654
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:17,671
After that, we plan to discuss what we can do to contribute...

655
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,811
to Yumyung Group's brighter future.

656
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,711
That sounds great. You should go back and have your discussion.

657
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:27,381
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

658
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:29,052
- Let's go. - Let's go, guys.

659
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:31,251
Our vision!

660
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:33,392
- Let's go. - Come on, guys!

661
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:35,921
Let's go.

662
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:41,191
What should we do?

663
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:43,901
I've never even thought about what to write in a vision statement.

664
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:45,901
What am I going to present?

665
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:49,242
Stop whining and just write something, will you?

666
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:51,001
Reflect on the past...

667
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,072
and the present and think about how we can do better in the future.

668
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:56,941
Keep your ideals high, but be realistic at the same time.

669
00:44:57,182 --> 00:45:00,351
Dream big, but also be practical.

670
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:01,811
Got it? That's how we should think.

671
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,452
- Mr. Jung. - Yes?

672
00:45:03,651 --> 00:45:04,782
Have you come up with yours?

673
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,592
- For goodness' sake. - You should hurry, sir.

674
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:14,291
I wouldn't have come had I know this would happen. I regret coming.

675
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:15,831
That's what I'm saying.

676
00:45:15,831 --> 00:45:18,362
The schedule was just for show. I can't believe we have to do this.

677
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:20,972
Totally. This doesn't even feel like a team-building workshop.

678
00:45:20,972 --> 00:45:23,202
- It's like a punishment. - I know, right?

679
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,092
Ms. Kim, do you know why I'm here?

680
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:46,831
Earlier, you said that you decided to come because of Mr. Yang.

681
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:49,961
No, that's actually not why I'm here. I'm here because of you.

682
00:45:51,202 --> 00:45:53,072
Thinking about how you keep rejecting me...

683
00:45:53,072 --> 00:45:55,271
got me all riled up, so I couldn't stay home.

684
00:45:55,802 --> 00:45:58,242
And I didn't want you to think about your childhood sweetheart.

685
00:45:58,242 --> 00:46:00,612
Hence, I decided to come to make you think about me every second.

686
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:03,412
What a blessing for your brain.

687
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,251
Ms. Kim, do you know what the goal of this workshop is?

688
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:12,291
Building team unity and cooperation?

689
00:46:12,992 --> 00:46:13,992
Wrong.

690
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:16,461
It's putting an end to this flirting and starting a relationship.

691
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:17,862
Sorry?

692
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,992
Just wait and see. By the time this workshop is over,

693
00:46:19,992 --> 00:46:21,992
you'll be my girlfriend.

694
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:24,862
You'll be his what?

695
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:29,429
Ms. Kim, do you know what the goal of this workshop is?

696
00:46:31,628 --> 00:46:33,498
Building team unity and cooperation?

697
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,199
Wrong.

698
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:37,639
It's putting an end to this flirting and starting a relationship.

699
00:46:37,938 --> 00:46:39,038
Sorry?

700
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,409
Just wait and see. By the time this workshop is over,

701
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:43,279
you'll be my girlfriend.

702
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:46,279
You'll be his what?

703
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,489
Well, I overheard Mr. Lee saying that you'll be his something.

704
00:46:53,788 --> 00:46:55,418
Oh, that was just about...

705
00:46:55,418 --> 00:46:56,918
I said we'll be a better team.

706
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,828
We'll become one after the workshop especially because I'm here now.

707
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:02,799
Yes, sir. You're absolutely right.

708
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:04,628
Let's go. Everyone must be waiting.

709
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:25,078
All right, then...

710
00:47:25,078 --> 00:47:27,719
We'll each present our vision statement now.

711
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:31,659
Who wants to go first?

712
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:34,288
Who should go first?

713
00:47:35,328 --> 00:47:37,458
All right. Let's give her a big hand, everyone.

714
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,469
- Ms. Bong will go first. - Gosh. What?

715
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:46,438
I never said...

716
00:47:58,478 --> 00:48:00,219
Well... My vision is...

717
00:48:01,018 --> 00:48:03,389
I believe that never losing your rookie spirit helps you...

718
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:05,529
feel a bigger sense of accomplishment.

719
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:08,328
It'll... It'll also help you get bigger raises...

720
00:48:08,328 --> 00:48:10,259
Return to your seat if you don't know what to say.

721
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:11,929
Yes, sir. I'll go back to my seat.

722
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:18,339
Then I'll present my vision statement to you all.

723
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,909
The American psychologist, David McClelland, said...

724
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:30,478
that experiencing success...

725
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:34,319
and deriving joy or a sense of reward from it...

726
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,759
further intensifies one's motivation and desire to accomplish more.

727
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:40,529
Based on McClelland's Human Motivation Theory,

728
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:43,699
I'll do my best to minimize PPM and maximize our CSI.

729
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:45,998
What is PPM? All I know is 2PM.

730
00:48:45,998 --> 00:48:48,128
I have no clue either. What's CSI? "Crime Scene Investigation"?

731
00:48:48,998 --> 00:48:51,569
Hence, I'd like to become an indispensable asset...

732
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:53,909
to the company, who can develop and implement...

733
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:55,679
effective plans using my unique abilities.

734
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:06,648
This is not why I came here.

735
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:08,148
Pardon me?

736
00:49:09,518 --> 00:49:10,589
It's nothing. Never mind.

737
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:14,728
Then as a graduate of Seoul National University, I shall...

738
00:49:14,728 --> 00:49:15,859
Hold on.

739
00:49:16,728 --> 00:49:19,469
Your vision can't really be expressed with words.

740
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:21,299
- Then how... - We must...

741
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:23,869
use our eyes.

742
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:28,668
No elaborate words are needed. You'll each get two seconds...

743
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:30,438
to communicate your vision to me with your eyes.

744
00:49:30,938 --> 00:49:32,779
All right. We'll get started.

745
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:02,279
Is that expression congruent to your vision?

746
00:50:04,308 --> 00:50:06,878
It shows my determination to continue to plow through...

747
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:08,279
this hardship.

748
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:10,279
Excellent.

749
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:15,458
Let's end the presentation here...

750
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:17,659
and have some free time.

751
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:24,159
No, this time is scheduled for Find the Ribbon.

752
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:27,398
- Find the Ribbon? - Yes.

753
00:50:27,628 --> 00:50:30,969
Ribbons with the company motto are hidden in the mountain.

754
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:32,409
We will form in groups of two,

755
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:34,938
and the team that finds the most number of ribbons will win.

756
00:50:34,938 --> 00:50:36,679
It's like a treasure hunt game.

757
00:50:39,308 --> 00:50:41,049
So we will form groups of two.

758
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:48,119
Great. Let's begin right away.

759
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:58,429
Then I will team up with Ms. Kim.

760
00:51:01,898 --> 00:51:03,239
Why me?

761
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:05,969
I'd like to discuss politics, society, economy,

762
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:08,509
and world trade with my partner while hiking the mountain.

763
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:11,409
Is there anyone other than Ms. Kim who wants to join me?

764
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:15,179
Ms. Kim is perfect.

765
00:51:15,308 --> 00:51:16,748
- Yes. - Yes.

766
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,719
She is.

767
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,619
Ms. Kim and Mr. Lee will form a team.

768
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:24,359
You will be one team. You will be one team.

769
00:51:25,558 --> 00:51:27,128
You will be one team.

770
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:30,898
Mr. Park and I will go and tie the ribbons.

771
00:51:32,029 --> 00:51:33,628
- That sounds great. - All right.

772
00:51:48,779 --> 00:51:51,819
Ms. Bong, you got changed.

773
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:54,748
You are wearing really sexy clothes.

774
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:57,219
Mr. Ko is here.

775
00:51:57,319 --> 00:51:59,728
So I wore three push-up inserts.

776
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:04,128
But I'm not wearing any on my bottom.

777
00:52:04,128 --> 00:52:06,328
I am blessed with nice hips.

778
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:09,668
Where did they go? Gosh.

779
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:11,839
Wait for me!

780
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:23,779
All right. Now, we all have teams.

781
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:26,549
You should go stand with your teammate.

782
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:28,719
Please come here, Ms. Kim.

783
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:32,159
Ms. Bong, you are here. Here.

784
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,889
Mr. Lee.

785
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:38,598
This chocolate contains my heart.

786
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:42,339
If you get tired while hiking, you should consume this.

787
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:45,268
Thank you.

788
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,339
Today's winner will win not only the gift certificate...

789
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:52,578
but also a tablet PC.

790
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,518
No way.

791
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:59,648
All right.

792
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:03,119
Now, ready.

793
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:07,359
Go.

794
00:53:09,828 --> 00:53:12,398
- Mr. Ko. What? - Go!

795
00:53:12,628 --> 00:53:14,469
- Go! Hurry! - Wait for me!

796
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:16,668
- Go! Go! - Go!

797
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:18,469
- Go, Mr. Lee! - Go, Mr. Lee!

798
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:20,009
Cheers!

799
00:53:20,938 --> 00:53:22,538
It won't be easy.

800
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:32,848
Where is it?

801
00:53:33,748 --> 00:53:37,219
What are you doing? Hurry. I need to win the tablet PC.

802
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:40,228
What's that look?

803
00:53:40,628 --> 00:53:44,359
Did you think I was pathetic?

804
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:46,898
Because I care so much about the prize?

805
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:49,668
No, it's not like that.

806
00:53:51,139 --> 00:53:52,139
Listen.

807
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:54,739
It's not the prize I care so much about.

808
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:56,808
I care a great deal about being the winner.

809
00:53:57,409 --> 00:54:00,279
It always feels thrilling to win.

810
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:02,549
All right. Let's move.

811
00:54:02,648 --> 00:54:04,248
I don't want to.

812
00:54:06,188 --> 00:54:07,949
It's a ribbon. There.

813
00:54:09,188 --> 00:54:10,418
(Passion)

814
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:12,558
It's a ribbon.

815
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,228
We found one.

816
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:20,529
- Come on. - How did they tie it there?

817
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:24,938
We found one.

818
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:32,708
What are you doing?

819
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,058
Are you going up there?

820
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:51,128
Of course. I have to win and get a tablet PC.

821
00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:54,869
I don't care about that, but I need to be the winner.

822
00:54:57,498 --> 00:54:58,739
Be careful.

823
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:07,248
I got it. I got a ribbon!

824
00:55:07,248 --> 00:55:09,148
- We found a ribbon! - Ribbon!

825
00:55:11,648 --> 00:55:12,788
All right.

826
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,989
Was it always this high?

827
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:23,699
Wait.

828
00:55:23,998 --> 00:55:26,398
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

829
00:55:26,529 --> 00:55:29,139
Help me. I can't get down.

830
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:30,799
- What? - Come and share your back.

831
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,708
I will step on you and go down.

832
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:34,839
Did you say you are going to step on me?

833
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:35,878
Hurry.

834
00:55:40,648 --> 00:55:42,449
- Mom. - Ms. Kim.

835
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:43,978
- I can't hear you. - Ms. Kim.

836
00:55:44,078 --> 00:55:45,848
I think the signal is bad because I'm in the middle of a mountain.

837
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:48,549
- Ms. Kim, don't put it there! - I'll call you when I'm down.

838
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:51,219
How can you leave my blazer there?

839
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,688
Ms. Kim! Ms. Kim! Ms. Kim!

840
00:55:54,929 --> 00:55:55,929
My gosh.

841
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:58,058
How can she put my blazer there?

842
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:01,628
This is crazy. My gosh.

843
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:03,168
Ms. Kim!

844
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:05,268
Save me!

845
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:07,168
Save me!

846
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,109
Save me!

847
00:56:09,878 --> 00:56:11,409
Someone help me!

848
00:56:12,509 --> 00:56:14,449
Mommy!

849
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,018
Today, Dad got me caramels.

850
00:56:22,688 --> 00:56:24,759
I left a lot for you.

851
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:27,889
My sisters tried to eat them,

852
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:30,159
but I safeguarded yours.

853
00:56:31,529 --> 00:56:34,199
Aren't you going to come to see me?

854
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:36,139
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

855
00:56:36,469 --> 00:56:39,538
I want you to come soon.

856
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,078
Hey, I forgot your name.

857
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:46,779
I can't remember your name.

858
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:50,679
I can write well now,

859
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:53,518
but I can't write your name because I don't remember it.

860
00:56:53,848 --> 00:56:55,958
Visit me soon and tell me your name again.

861
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:04,558
I wonder what Mi So is doing right now.

862
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:15,779
Ms. Kim, shall we continue where we left off?

863
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:18,739
- Sir? - I didn't profess my love...

864
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,348
because I was blinded by jealousy and desire to win.

865
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:21,808
You are mistaken.

866
00:57:32,688 --> 00:57:34,128
(Writer Lee Sung Yeon)

867
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:39,471
(Writer Lee Sung Yeon)

868
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,810
Why are you calling her?

869
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,350
Why are you answering Mi So's phone?

870
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:51,721
I'm with her.

871
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,350
What?

872
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,491
It doesn't sound urgent, so I will hang up now.

873
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:57,991
We are in the middle of an important conversation.

874
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,560
What are you doing right now?

875
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:04,531
I told you.

876
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:06,401
Focus on the person you like at the moment.

877
00:58:06,531 --> 00:58:09,640
I told you too. It's the memory I really want to find.

878
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:11,301
So?

879
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,710
So you are going to keep meeting my brother...

880
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,710
and try to bring back your memory?

881
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,611
- Yes. - Even if I hate it this much?

882
00:58:16,611 --> 00:58:17,741
Yes.

883
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,361
It's over there!

884
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:38,701
Go, Secretary Yang!

885
00:58:39,201 --> 00:58:41,171
Well done. Well done.

886
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,270
I got it.

887
00:58:43,441 --> 00:58:44,471
Let's go.

888
00:58:46,971 --> 00:58:49,881
My gosh. What was that?

889
00:58:49,881 --> 00:58:52,410
You look like you could beat up just about anything.

890
00:58:55,051 --> 00:58:57,020
I am actually quite weak.

891
00:58:57,051 --> 00:58:58,421
Good for you.

892
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:02,991
What are you looking at?

893
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,261
Do I look prettier in the mountain?

894
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:08,930
- A bug. - What?

895
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,761
Are you saying I look like a bug?

896
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:12,870
That's not it.

897
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:14,631
There's a bug over there.

898
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,441
What do I do?

899
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:21,310
There's a bug inside my shirt.

900
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:24,410
- What do I do? There's a bug! - What's going on?

901
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,451
- No way! - What's wrong?

902
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:27,951
A bug went inside my shirt.

903
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:29,080
What do I do?

904
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:31,250
I see.

905
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:32,951
What do I do?

906
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:00,651
Wait.

907
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:03,451
Have you seen Ms. Kim Ji Ah?

908
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:07,290
- No. - My gosh.

909
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,691
Where did she go?

910
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:40,281
Mr. Lee.

911
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:42,651
Just stay there.

912
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:44,281
If not now, when will you be able to use...

913
01:01:44,281 --> 01:01:46,091
a 9,000-dollar umbrella?

914
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,850
This blazer is a limited edition.

915
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,660
Let's take shelter from the rain.

916
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:26,531
I'm worried about catching a cold.

917
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,660
I'm fine. I am actually quite strong.

918
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,430
I am talking about me, not you.

919
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,000
I am worried about myself catching a cold.

920
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,441
Right. You get cold easily.

921
01:02:50,721 --> 01:02:52,290
When will the rain stop?

922
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,960
Ms. Kim. You're fine.

923
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,131
You don't need to be scared.

924
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:08,830
You're fine.

925
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:18,111
Take this, Ms. Kim.

926
01:03:20,511 --> 01:03:22,921
Take this and relax.

927
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:28,991
I want to go home.

928
01:03:29,321 --> 01:03:30,890
Mi So, stop crying.

929
01:03:31,191 --> 01:03:33,361
If you stop, I will give you something delicious.

930
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,131
Something delicious?

931
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,500
Here. Here's a caramel.

932
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,671
Don't cry once you eat it.

933
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:41,701
Promise me.

934
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,441
Enjoy it.

935
01:03:58,551 --> 01:03:59,651
Thank you.

936
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:25,140
Do you feel better now?

937
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:28,051
I do. I feel a lot better.

938
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:42,761
It seems like the rain stopped.

939
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,671
Should we head down?

940
01:04:46,971 --> 01:04:48,031
Let's go.

941
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:03,051
Ever since that incident,

942
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,921
I developed a fear of spiders.

943
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:10,821
I mean the kidnapping incident from when I was young.

944
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,830
At that time, there was a huge spider...

945
01:05:17,901 --> 01:05:20,171
outside the door.

946
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:24,540
Do you know the strange feeling you get when you visit...

947
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,140
a place from your childhood as an adult?

948
01:05:27,171 --> 01:05:28,770
You wonder if that place has always been that tight...

949
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:30,881
and small.

950
01:05:31,881 --> 01:05:32,910
What?

951
01:05:33,151 --> 01:05:37,250
When you are a small child, everything keeps relatively big.

952
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,191
That's why the spider you saw looked so big.

953
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,020
There's no need to be scared of it now.

954
01:05:44,761 --> 01:05:45,930
Do you think that's it?

955
01:05:49,031 --> 01:05:51,230
- Have you had a dog? - No.

956
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,770
Long time ago,

957
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:56,071
I had a purest bred Golden Retriever.

958
01:05:56,301 --> 01:05:59,511
HIs name was Big Bang Andromeda Supernova Sonic.

959
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:06,750
You named the dog yourself as a kid, didn't you?

960
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:08,210
Of course I did.

961
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,381
Big Bang Andromeda Supernova Sonic was such a good dog.

962
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,750
He didn't bark much. He was clever.

963
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:17,191
Then one day, Big Bang Andromeda Super Sonic...

964
01:06:17,191 --> 01:06:19,430
Can't we shorten it and call him "Big Bang"?

965
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:20,861
We can't.

966
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:24,661
Anyway, he had one strange habit.

967
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:27,630
Whenever I gave him a gum, he always buried in the ground.

968
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:31,371
He didn't even dig it up again.

969
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:33,571
He just forgot about it.

970
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:38,241
Could he have suffered from shortness of memory?

971
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,711
Maybe.

972
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,651
Big Bang is long dead,

973
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,920
but the gums he had buried...

974
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,191
must be somewhere in my front yard.

975
01:06:49,321 --> 01:06:51,861
But do I need to dig them up?

976
01:06:53,361 --> 01:06:54,930
What if I dig them up...

977
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:57,531
and find out that they are gross and rotten?

978
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:02,270
I...

979
01:07:03,201 --> 01:07:06,140
just don't want you digging up a painful memory.

980
01:07:07,711 --> 01:07:11,010
Because of that incident, my family and my brother...

981
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,751
suffered for a long time.

982
01:07:14,611 --> 01:07:16,781
I was worried that you would go through...

983
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,991
the same thing.

984
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,031
Of course, like you said, I was jealous too.

985
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:32,270
I understand how you feel.

986
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:34,501
But...

987
01:07:38,371 --> 01:07:39,470
as you know,

988
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,480
I've been living for my family rather than for myself.

989
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:44,911
And even my job requires me...

990
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,810
to prioritize another person to me.

991
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:50,380
That's why...

992
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:54,050
I'm not used to people being considerate of me.

993
01:07:58,161 --> 01:07:59,361
But that day,

994
01:08:00,961 --> 01:08:03,060
at that scary moment,

995
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:06,701
your brother protected me.

996
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,140
It was the kindest thing someone has ever done for me.

997
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,111
So I hope you won't hate me...

998
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:20,751
meeting Sung Yeon,

999
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:23,850
who's shown me such kindness.

1000
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:36,300
You can have whatever you want...

1001
01:08:36,831 --> 01:08:38,100
and know whatever you want to know.

1002
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:40,270
I will understand.

1003
01:08:41,901 --> 01:08:43,241
You can do everything you wish to do.

1004
01:08:49,781 --> 01:08:51,010
I will bear it.

1005
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,751
I am confident...

1006
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,550
to bear everything about you.

1007
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:29,681
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim)

1008
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:32,491
The mood between them is a bit strange.

1009
01:09:32,991 --> 01:09:35,090
I give you permission to dream about me.

1010
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:37,821
Tonight, we'll have a sweet kiss.

1011
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,430
It's not that I don't want to.

1012
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,331
I want to do it too.

1013
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:44,100
- Kissing couples... - I'm sorry.

1014
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,031
I'll tell them to make it again.

1015
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,371
Are you hiding something from Ms. Kim?

1016
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,100
He's very sensitive to the cold.

1017
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:51,441
I like winter.

1018
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,470
When I close my eyes, a ghost appears from time to time.

1019
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:56,441
I'll put up with it.

1020
01:09:56,441 --> 01:09:59,480
I, Lee Young Joon, is capable of putting up with everything.
