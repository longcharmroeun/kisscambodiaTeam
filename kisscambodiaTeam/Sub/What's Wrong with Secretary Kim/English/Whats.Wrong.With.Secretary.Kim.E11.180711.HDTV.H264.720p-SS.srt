1
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:21,393
How did you come here?

2
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:27,934
She said my memory is wrong.

3
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:33,703
Do you agree?

4
00:00:42,214 --> 00:00:44,053
Is it such a tough question...

5
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:47,494
to answer?

6
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:51,924
We have a special guest who will make the show shine.

7
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:55,794
Let's bring in the model Kim Na Yeon.

8
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:15,453
Does it mean...

9
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:20,054
my memory is wrong?

10
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:28,893
I sometimes...

11
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:31,904
dreamed of my childhood...

12
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,203
which I couldn't understand the meaning of.

13
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:36,934
If ever...

14
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:38,944
If ever...

15
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:42,973
- If the memory is... - Your father's gone to work.

16
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:44,944
What nonsense are you talking about?

17
00:01:44,944 --> 00:01:47,384
Auntie's acting strange.

18
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:51,384
No, Mi So. She's not your auntie.

19
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:53,184
It's a spider. It's a big spider.

20
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:55,623
I am scared.

21
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:58,863
Mi So. Stay there. Don't come here.

22
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,033
No, don't go.

23
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,494
Don't leave me alone here.

24
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:05,304
Don't come near me, you idiot.

25
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,674
I remembered.

26
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:24,954
Mi So.

27
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:26,524
Mi So. Wake up. Mi So.

28
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:28,093
Kim Mi So!

29
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:34,734
Mi So, wake up.

30
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:35,994
Mi So.

31
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:38,734
Mi So!

32
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:52,114
(Episode 11)

33
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:00,494
Mom.

34
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:07,764
Mom.

35
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:22,543
Mom?

36
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:28,454
Mom!

37
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:36,424
You are not Mom.

38
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,964
Hey, are you looking for your mom?

39
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,274
Yes.

40
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:53,843
Do you want me to take you to your mom?

41
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:56,973
Really? My mom is in the hospital.

42
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:59,114
Can you find her?

43
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:02,413
Of course. I can take you there.

44
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:03,684
Let's go.

45
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:12,864
(Danger)

46
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:31,043
Will you really take me to go see Mommy...

47
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:33,714
if I sleep here for just one night, Auntie?

48
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:48,433
I want the same bracelet that he has on, Auntie!

49
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:26,863
I'm Sung Hyun.

50
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:29,473
- Lee Sung Hyun. - Sung Yeon?

51
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,704
No, it's Sung Hyun.

52
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:35,473
Sung Yeon. I see, Sung Yeon!

53
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,584
- You really are an idiot. - I'm not an idiot.

54
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,654
I'm five years old...

55
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:43,183
but I'm better at reading than Mal Hee.

56
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,694
By the way, what's "dying"?

57
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,493
Daddy told me...

58
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:53,624
that Mommy might die because she's sick.

59
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:56,834
What will happen if she dies?

60
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:01,204
I don't know either.

61
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,033
Are you an idiot?

62
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,404
What?

63
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:07,543
My sister Pil Nam told me that "dying"...

64
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:10,514
means that I won't be able to see Mommy anymore.

65
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:13,644
You're nine years old, and yet you don't even know that?

66
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:15,283
You really are an idiot.

67
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:16,613
Who are you calling an idiot?

68
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:20,024
It's obvious that you won't be able to see her again if she dies.

69
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:26,923
Does that mean that I won't be able to see Mommy anymore, too?

70
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:32,264
N... No, wait. That's not it.

71
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,774
All right already, so hush. Okay?

72
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:39,343
You need to be quiet.

73
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:42,014
Your dad will be here soon, after all.

74
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,214
I'm sorry. We'll be quiet.

75
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:46,584
"Dad"?

76
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:50,783
My dad is at the hospital right now, though.

77
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:52,483
Your dad went to the office!

78
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:57,423
He'll be here soon, so you have to wait here quietly with Mommy.

79
00:06:57,923 --> 00:07:00,634
- My mom is also at the hospital... - Be quiet, Mi So!

80
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,593
Why do you keep spouting nonsense?

81
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,973
I think it's because she's not fully awake yet, Mom.

82
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,603
I'll calm her down, so don't worry.

83
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,173
We'll stay quiet.

84
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:28,223
Auntie is acting weird.

85
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,894
I want to go home!

86
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:34,064
Stop crying, Mi So.

87
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,464
If you stop crying, I'll give you something yummy.

88
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:38,363
Something yummy?

89
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:39,733
Yeah.

90
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:47,113
Here's a caramel.

91
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,343
If I give you this, you have to promise not to cry.

92
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:50,843
Promise me.

93
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:58,824
Is it good?

94
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,793
Enjoy.

95
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:32,654
Lady...

96
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:34,953
Mom.

97
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:41,764
Your younger sister is sleeping. You have to be quiet.

98
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:44,663
Yes, Mom.

99
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:48,673
I'll stay quiet like this until Dad gets here.

100
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:53,043
No, Dad isn't coming...

101
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,014
because...

102
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:58,943
I'm not your mom.

103
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:09,693
I gave my all to that man...

104
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:14,193
but he didn't feel the same way.

105
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:20,063
I even killed the baby inside of my womb for that man...

106
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:26,943
I'm sure that man...

107
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:32,313
is probably sleeping soundly with a daughter and son like you two.

108
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:36,413
Why am I the only one who is suffering like this? Why?

109
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:39,453
My only crime was loving that man.

110
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,463
If I die...

111
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:51,404
will he feel even a little bit of guilt, I wonder?

112
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,203
Let's go together.

113
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:01,543
I don't want to go alone.

114
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:03,443
You two are coming with me...

115
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:05,683
Then you can just forget about that cowardly and wicked man...

116
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,913
and just start over now!

117
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,154
Stop this now, please.

118
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,654
Please let us go.

119
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:17,364
I definitely won't report you. Please?

120
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:34,874
It's too late.

121
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,744
I've already come too far.

122
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,453
Thanks for comforting me, Child.

123
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:14,053
You can't.

124
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:16,553
You can't, Lady.

125
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,654
Please, don't!

126
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:21,953
Stop it!

127
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:26,163
Looks like I'll have to leave without returning the favor to you.

128
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:27,793
No.

129
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:29,663
Sorry.

130
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:32,004
Please, don't!

131
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:35,073
In exchange...

132
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,904
please, watch my final moments.

133
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:40,374
Somebody!

134
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,374
Somebody, please help!

135
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,783
Please help us!

136
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,313
Please help us!

137
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:50,254
No!

138
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:00,224
Why?

139
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:04,364
Why?

140
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:09,904
What are you doing over there?

141
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:13,203
Stay right there, Mi So. Don't come here.

142
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:15,943
What is that?

143
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,313
Auntie?

144
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:21,154
Auntie looks weird.

145
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:22,984
I'm scared.

146
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:25,923
I can't let this be Mi So's introduction...

147
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,224
to the concept of death, when her mother may die.

148
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:31,323
No, Mi So.

149
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:33,563
That's not Auntie.

150
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,063
That's...

151
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,904
a spider. A big spider.

152
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,543
That spider is scary!

153
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,913
Mommy.

154
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:00,453
It's okay, Mi So.

155
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,854
The spider won't come here, so don't cry.

156
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:06,693
But, my feet.

157
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,264
My feet hurt so much.

158
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:14,073
I'll go get some scissors from outside and untie you.

159
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:24,344
She's here.

160
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:26,413
That dead woman...

161
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:28,713
is right above me.

162
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:36,494
Mi So.

163
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,124
Mi So, you're over there, right?

164
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:41,833
Why are you crying?

165
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:44,533
You haven't been bitten by the spider, have you?

166
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:47,533
- Oh no! - I'm fine.

167
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,144
The one here with me is Mi So.

168
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:54,144
It's not that woman. Mi So is with me.

169
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,063
Listen to me carefully, Mi So.

170
00:14:16,494 --> 00:14:17,563
Okay.

171
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:21,333
In Africa, there's a spider that is as big as a human adult.

172
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:22,734
And it's really dangerous,

173
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:25,744
so if you meet its gaze, it'll bite you.

174
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:27,614
- Really? - Yes.

175
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,974
I think there's that spider outside.

176
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:33,083
Make sure you close your eyes in order not to see it.

177
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:35,014
- Okay? - Okay.

178
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:36,913
Now, let's go home.

179
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:39,053
Hold my hand tightly and follow me.

180
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,394
Okay.

181
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,183
This is my house.

182
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:12,154
It's really nearby.

183
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:15,923
You shouldn't come outside alone like that from now on.

184
00:15:16,193 --> 00:15:17,793
- Okay? - Okay.

185
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:21,933
By the way, you know what? I'm going to marry you.

186
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,364
What, marry?

187
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,663
Yes, you're like a prince.

188
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:29,974
Are you rich too?

189
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:31,774
- Rich? - Yes.

190
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:35,774
My daddy told me to marry a rich man for certain.

191
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:39,384
Well, my dad is rich,

192
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,154
so I'm rich too, I suppose.

193
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:42,754
How rich are you?

194
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:45,484
Can you buy a Nana Doll?

195
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:46,783
Nana Doll?

196
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:48,823
Yoonbong Company manufactures them.

197
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:52,364
That company is our company's subcontractor.

198
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:55,063
Subcontractor? What's that? Is that food?

199
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:59,904
All the manufacturing factories of Nana Doll are ours.

200
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:03,274
Promise me already that you'll marry me.

201
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:06,374
- No. - Come on.

202
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:09,813
You marry someone you love after you grow up.

203
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:14,453
Then you can love me after you grow up.

204
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:19,283
Okay, let's do it.

205
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:22,254
Promise.

206
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,994
I'll come to see you again.

207
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,734
That's how we were able to come back safely.

208
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:05,933
(Police Station)

209
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:09,374
(Police Station)

210
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:35,193
Sung Hyun.

211
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,003
- Sung Hyun. - Sung Hyun.

212
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:41,233
Sung Hyun, are you okay?

213
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,233
Sung Hyun.

214
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:46,604
Go with me.

215
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:49,114
Come here.

216
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:51,144
Help me.

217
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:54,084
- Mom, no! - Sung Hyun.

218
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,713
- No! - What's wrong?

219
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:57,084
- No! - Sung Hyun.

220
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,554
- No! - What's wrong?

221
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:00,253
- No, please. - Please call the doctor.

222
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,453
Sung Hyun it's going to be okay.

223
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:08,064
But I couldn't live on as if nothing happened.

224
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:14,003
Whenever I struggled, I wondered...

225
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:15,733
how you were doing.

226
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:21,513
I...

227
00:18:23,314 --> 00:18:26,114
want to go to that neighborhood again.

228
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:29,854
Can we look around there just for a while?

229
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,193
I wanted to keep my promise with her...

230
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:36,193
that I'd go see her again.

231
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:43,334
(Yumyung Land Construction Site)

232
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,134
I told you there'd be nothing.

233
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:50,003
I promised her that I'd go see her again.

234
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:00,183
Hello, sir.

235
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:03,824
Ever since then, it was hard for me to face...

236
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:05,324
young women who were like that kidnapper.

237
00:19:07,223 --> 00:19:08,894
I put all of them away, sir.

238
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:13,493
I suffered from the trauma when I saw cable ties,

239
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,534
but it was bearable.

240
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,034
But from time to time,

241
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,973
I wondered...

242
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,003
how you were doing.

243
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:26,904
And one day...

244
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,374
- Cheers. - Cheers.

245
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:30,443
I happened to run into you again like a dream.

246
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:37,084
How nice.

247
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,124
What's your name?

248
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:42,824
I'm Kim Mi So.

249
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:48,634
- Mi So. - Yes?

250
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:50,233
Do you know who I am?

251
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:53,263
Yes, you're the chairman's son.

252
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,173
Are you not?

253
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:00,874
Yes, I am.

254
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:02,943
- Mi So, cheers. - All right, here.

255
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:05,943
I'll do my best.

256
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:08,154
I felt somewhat upset,

257
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:12,554
but I thought it was fortunate at the same time...

258
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:16,154
because it was better for me...

259
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:18,463
to take the burden of that day alone forever.

260
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:29,104
Hello, sir.

261
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:34,473
I'm Kim Mi So, your secretary as of today.

262
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:36,913
I'll work hard. I hope we get along.

263
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,443
What was I thinking?

264
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,384
Wanting...

265
00:20:45,723 --> 00:20:47,423
to keep you by my side...

266
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:08,374
Hello, this is the general affairs team of Yumyung Group.

267
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:10,314
Hello, I'm Hiyoshi of Nassan Motor Company.

268
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:12,044
I'm calling to check a few things.

269
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:14,483
I'm really sorry. Can you speak in English?

270
00:21:15,513 --> 00:21:16,614
What is it?

271
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,354
There was no one here, so I picked the phone, and he's Japanese.

272
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,193
I can't speak in Japanese.

273
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:23,723
Give me that.

274
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:26,364
Hello?

275
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,894
The person in charge isn't in the office at the moment.

276
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:32,763
Okay, understood. Sorry for the inconvenience.

277
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:36,574
Thank you.

278
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:39,203
I mean, you're the CFO's secretary,

279
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:41,013
so why aren't you capable of this much?

280
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:42,973
Is it because she didn't go to college?

281
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:51,624
Hey.

282
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:53,624
Me?

283
00:21:54,723 --> 00:21:55,923
I'm doing great.

284
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,394
By the way, Pil Nam,

285
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:04,263
there are so many smart people here.

286
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:07,673
We have a lot of business to deal with foreign buyers,

287
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:11,604
but I'm the only one who can't understand every time.

288
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:17,913
No, I'm okay.

289
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:22,483
You know I'm good at adapting myself.

290
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:24,354
I can do a good job.

291
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:31,564
Pil Nam, I have to go now. Bye.

("Learning Japanese in One Step")

293
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:56,854
Master 30 pages of this book a day.

294
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:59,554
I'll check if you've done it myself every day.

295
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:01,124
You'll check every day?

296
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:12,334
How is the weather today?

297
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:16,374
Today's weather is...

298
00:23:19,203 --> 00:23:20,344
I'm sorry.

299
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:35,094
Can you tell me about your future ambition?

300
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,693
I want to assist the CFO...

301
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:42,294
without making any mistakes.

302
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:50,503
- I'm sorry. - Is that all you know?

303
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:53,673
Memorize, then remember.

304
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:55,713
Why can't you do it?

305
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:21,773
(It's your homework to put your life on the line in memorizing it.)

306
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:33,544
I'll master Japanese for certain and escape from this humiliation.

307
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:39,423
(CFO Lee is a jerk.)

308
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:48,763
What's the schedule for today?

309
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:51,163
You have the directors' meeting in the morning...

310
00:24:51,163 --> 00:24:54,933
and the Businessmen's Forum in the afternoon.

311
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:03,784
It's a gift for you.

"A gift"?

313
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:08,384
I'm giving you this because you improved a lot in a short time.

00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:10,483
Your hard work always brings outcomes.

315
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,023
You're the first employee who got a gift from me.

316
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:15,654
Keep that honored heart for a long time.

317
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,723

Ms. Kim.

00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:46,154

I'm sorry, sir.

324
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:23,253
You stayed up for three days, so you must be tied.

325
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:24,394
You may leave work.

326
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:28,034
No, I have to organize data and send it by today.

328
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:32,364
got delayed.

329
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:33,733
What?

330
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:36,534
I haven't heard of it.

331
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:37,874
I just got the message.

332
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:39,973
Leave work then.

can you delay the schedule?

It's my gift to congratulate your promotion.

337
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,183
Go ahead and open it, CFO...

338
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,223

00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,233
You don't seem to need anything.

341
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:39,334
Even if you needed something, it'd probably be expensive.

342
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:42,634
So I made this to express my sincerity.

343
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:49,743
It's not really my style.

344
00:27:52,544 --> 00:27:54,114
Then give it back to me.

345
00:27:54,114 --> 00:27:56,314
But I'm the person who takes importance on progress.

346
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,854
I'll gladly accept it for your sincerity.

347
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:01,794
Thank you.

348
00:28:03,154 --> 00:28:05,263
Please excuse me.

00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,983

351

Thank you.

352
00:28:35,693 --> 00:28:37,763
I've never received such a pretty cake before.

353
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:41,193
It's nothing special. Of course, I had a famous patissier bake it,

354
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,193
but it's not that expensive.

355
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:45,904
Can I take a picture with this?

356
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:47,003
Of course.

357
00:29:00,983 --> 00:29:02,183
You dropped it.

358
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:06,784
Oh, dear.

359
00:29:08,423 --> 00:29:11,064
- I'm sorry. - It's not a big deal,

360
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:14,963
so don't give me that look on your birthday.

361
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:24,074
- I thought... - You dropped it in a pretty way.

362
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:25,943
we'd always be together like that.

363
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,544
I think you should hire a new secretary.

364
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:34,983
I want to resign now.

365
00:29:37,124 --> 00:29:38,854
Then I realized it for the first time...

366
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:42,923
that I'd never be able to let you go.

367
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:44,993
You...

368
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:48,364
were the one I needed from the start.

369
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:54,473
So...

370
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:56,933
wake up already, Mi So.

371
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:21,034
What did you tell her?

372
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:23,163
What did you say that made her collapse all of a sudden?

373
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:24,963
Did you talk about that story again?

374
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:29,173
Until when will you torment people around you with that?

375
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:31,904
It wasn't me...

376
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:34,614
who was trapped in there.

377
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:37,884
It was you, right?

378
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:42,384
What?

379
00:30:43,114 --> 00:30:44,183
You remember...

380
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,654
everything from that day, don't you?

381
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:56,163
I guess I'm right,

382
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:58,163
seeing how you're flustered.

383
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:02,604
Right.

384
00:31:03,273 --> 00:31:04,644
I felt strange all along...

385
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:06,773
because I couldn't understand.

386
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:11,084
Looking at me in so much pain,

387
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:13,854
you didn't feel guilty at all.

388
00:31:15,614 --> 00:31:16,753
It was because...

389
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:20,723
you were the one who got kidnapped, not me.

390
00:31:57,923 --> 00:31:59,023
You're up.

391
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,094
How do you feel?

392
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,173
I'll bring you something to drink.

393
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:14,013
I should hand more of your work over to Ji Ah.

394
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:16,844
You're overworked.

395
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:20,614
You...

396
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,884
didn't lose your memory, did you?

397
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:32,794
You're just acting like you did, aren't you?

398
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,034
I don't know what you're talking about.

399
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,074
Sung Hyun.

400
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:54,213
I remember it all now.

401
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:00,693
What happened that day...

402
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,193
and that woman too.

403
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,233
Now, I know...

404
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:20,443
why I wanted to find you so much.

405
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:26,683
I wanted to thank you.

406
00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:34,193
You must've been scared and terrified that day as well.

407
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:39,263
So I wanted to thank you...

408
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:44,604
for protecting me despite the fear.

409
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:04,824
Who else would've been able to protect you otherwise?

410
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:10,693
It was possible because I was Lee Young Joon.

411
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:18,904
I wanted to hide it until the end,

412
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:20,773
but I guess I've failed.

413
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:32,143
Don't cry. You need to rest.

414
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,654
How can I rest right now?

415
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,914
How can you do that?

416
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,884
Why did you keep it a secret for such a long time?

417
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:49,233
I couldn't get it out of my head even for a day.

418
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:54,134
What happened back then,

419
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:56,833
what I saw,

420
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:59,173
and even what I heard.

421
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:03,844
Every time I closed my eyes,

422
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:08,213
the memories came flooding back so vividly as if it was yesterday.

423
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:10,384
Those horrible memories.

424
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:23,963
That's why I was relieved that you didn't remember it.

425
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:29,373
Nothing can stay a secret forever.

426
00:35:29,974 --> 00:35:31,003
I know.

427
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:34,474
But I wanted you to find out as late as possible.

428
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:39,284
I didn't want to share that pain.

429
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:48,123
It would've been better if you had never remembered it.

430
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,264
Don't say that.

431
00:35:52,494 --> 00:35:55,034
If I felt the same pain...

432
00:35:55,393 --> 00:35:59,003
and experienced what you went through, I wouldn't feel this bad.

433
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:06,773
You seem all considerate of me now,

434
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:08,974
but it does not suit you at all.

435
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:12,844
You should've been selfish and self-centered like you usually are.

436
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:21,353
Are you trying to compliment me or criticize me? Make up your mind.

437
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,534
Promise me...

438
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,304
that you'll never hide anything from me from now on.

439
00:36:40,344 --> 00:36:41,414
Okay, I promise you.

440
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:49,154
I'll stay by your side tonight.

441
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,184
Just like that day.

446
00:37:45,173 --> 00:37:47,313
Was Sung Hyun...

447
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:50,414
really locked up in here?

448
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:53,344
Because I...

449
00:37:54,284 --> 00:37:55,784
left him there?

450
00:37:56,514 --> 00:37:57,684
Because of me?

451
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:04,063
No.

452
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:07,264
No, that can't be.

453
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,293
No.

454
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:20,344
Hey! You can't run into the road like that!

455
00:38:39,824 --> 00:38:42,963
Ma'am, I think you should go check on him.

456
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:44,764
What happened?

457
00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:54,043
Sung Yeon.

458
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:56,574
Why did you tell me the truth?

459
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:03,154
Why tell the truth now after all these years?

460
00:39:05,324 --> 00:39:06,353
Sung Yeon.

461
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:14,364
It may have been my fault back then,

462
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:16,333
but not anymore.

463
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:18,963
Why...

464
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:23,634
Why didn't you tell me sooner that my memories were wrong?

465
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,713
I'm sorry.

466
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:35,353
I'm really sorry.

467
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:37,923
I must've looked like a big joke to him.

468
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:41,054
I must've looked so pathetic to Young Joon.

469
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,293
That's not true, Sung Yeon.

470
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:45,824
He doesn't know yet because he lost all of his memories from that time.

471
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:47,463
No, he didn't!

472
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,934
What do you mean?

473
00:39:56,503 --> 00:39:58,043
He remembers everything.

474
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:00,974
What?

475
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:32,474
Both her blood pressure and pulse are normal.

476
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:36,873
It was temporary anemia, so you don't have to worry too much.

477
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:39,813
Okay. Thank you for everything, Doctor.

478
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:54,963
- Where? - Right here?

479
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:08,574
Didn't you step out to talk to the doctor?

480
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:10,313
What took you so long?

481
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:13,284
An important guest stopped by, so I brought her here.

482
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:14,684
A guest?

483
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:16,684
It's a lady who time-traveled...

484
00:41:16,753 --> 00:41:19,684
to the present, 2018, from 1994.

485
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:21,423
What?

486
00:41:21,423 --> 00:41:23,123
You'll probably recognize her right away...

487
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:26,023
because she hasn't changed one bit.

488
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:30,434
(Na Na's Sweet Home)

489
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:32,664
My gosh, this is Na Na's Sweet Home.

490
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:39,744
The manufacturer went under shortly after the incident,

491
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:41,213
so I was only able to find one.

492
00:41:41,574 --> 00:41:43,273
And I've kept it until now just in case.

493
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:47,114
This makes me...

494
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:49,414
good enough to be husband material, right?

495
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:52,054
"Husband material"?

496
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:54,054
What do you mean?

497
00:41:57,423 --> 00:41:58,563
Don't you remember?

498
00:41:59,224 --> 00:42:01,364
You asked me if I could afford to buy you Na Na's Sweet Home.

499
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,664
You asked me if I was rich...

500
00:42:02,664 --> 00:42:05,103
and said that I should marry you, which totally flustered me.

501
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:08,074
I did?

502
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:12,404
I don't remember.

503
00:42:13,603 --> 00:42:15,213
That's okay. I understand.

504
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:18,514
My parents panicked when I, a nine-year-old boy, asked them...

505
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:19,943
to buy me Na Na's Sweet Home.

506
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,313
"Is the trauma making you regress back to infancy?"

507
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:23,954
"Or are you going through an identity crisis?"

508
00:42:23,954 --> 00:42:26,684
I worried my parents a lot just to get my hands on that doll,

509
00:42:26,684 --> 00:42:27,793
but it's okay.

510
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:30,054
Whether you remember saying that or not, it's my gift for you.

511
00:42:33,324 --> 00:42:34,364
Thank you.

512
00:42:35,463 --> 00:42:37,864
I wanted this so much when I was a kid.

513
00:42:38,364 --> 00:42:40,603
Back then, I thought her face was very pretty,

514
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:43,474
and her dress with this huge bow looked so gorgeous too.

515
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:46,704
And do you think it looks dowdy now?

516
00:42:49,244 --> 00:42:50,313
A little.

517
00:42:55,713 --> 00:42:57,014
Do you know this, Mr. Lee?

518
00:42:57,483 --> 00:43:00,284
Most dog chews are made from cow leather.

519
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:02,123
Really?

520
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:04,224
If you bury dog chews in the ground,

521
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:05,994
they'll decay and completely disappear.

522
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:08,434
I think...

523
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:12,264
Big Bang's chews must've completely disappeared by now.

524
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:18,103
And just like Big Bang's chews,

525
00:43:18,103 --> 00:43:20,103
memories can completely disappear too.

526
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:23,673
Shall we...

527
00:43:24,784 --> 00:43:28,884
bury all the bad memories deep in the ground together?

528
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:58,744
I'm happy that you're the boy I've been looking for.

529
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:02,014
I'm also happy...

530
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:04,454
that we met again like this.

531
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:08,753
I could barely hold myself back from expressing it.

532
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:16,664
(Yumyung Hospital)

533
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:18,103
I said I'm okay.

534
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,134
I'm totally fine.

535
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,134
Still, you have to do it no matter what.

536
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:27,543
Who gets an in-depth examination for fainting for a short while?

537
00:44:27,713 --> 00:44:30,483
But you did faint, which means you're not healthy.

538
00:44:30,813 --> 00:44:31,914
So just listen to me.

539
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:33,954
I can't do that. I have to go to work.

540
00:44:34,884 --> 00:44:36,114
Just take a day off.

541
00:44:36,114 --> 00:44:38,423
No, I can't. I have a lot to do today.

542
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,824
You're incredibly responsible and passionate about work,

543
00:44:43,023 --> 00:44:44,724
and I've highly valued it for the past nine years.

544
00:44:46,994 --> 00:44:49,134
But I won't allow that anymore...

545
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:50,833
because you're my woman now.

546
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:52,634
"My woman"?

547
00:44:56,304 --> 00:44:58,543
Do you see my fingers all curled up? What will you do about this?

548
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:02,844
This is good. You obviously can't work with your hands like this,

549
00:45:03,014 --> 00:45:06,213
- so you'll have to take today off. - What?

550
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:08,154
I'll come back right after the meeting.

551
00:45:08,154 --> 00:45:09,853
Call me if anything happens.

552
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:12,724
You can call me even if nothing happens.

553
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:23,634
Yumyung Department Store's...

554
00:45:24,164 --> 00:45:26,904
Dongseong-ro location in Daegu, which will open next week...

555
00:45:26,904 --> 00:45:29,373
The plan for the grand opening event looks great.

556
00:45:29,373 --> 00:45:32,103
Also, we're introducing a brand that has no stores in Korea yet,

557
00:45:32,103 --> 00:45:33,543
so it'll generate a lot of buzz.

558
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,643
We should also use the fact that it'll have...

559
00:45:36,643 --> 00:45:38,713
the biggest kids' cafe in Daegu to market the department store.

560
00:45:39,713 --> 00:45:42,684
I think the grand opening will be very successful.

561
00:45:44,923 --> 00:45:46,623
Yes, I think so too, but...

562
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,693
Then let's wrap up the meeting.

563
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:54,434
The meeting is already over?

564
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:58,333
I thought it'd drag on because he usually nitpicks over everything.

565
00:45:58,434 --> 00:45:59,563
What's gotten into him?

566
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:01,204
Oh, right.

567
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:04,204
See you.

568
00:46:06,373 --> 00:46:08,574
Hey, are you in a rush or something?

569
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:10,914
- What? No. - Why did you end it so quickly?

570
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:16,713
You did that because of me, right? Because you knew I was upset.

571
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:21,523
I acted like I was fine, but I guess you could tell.

572
00:46:22,623 --> 00:46:24,094
Frankly, I've been having a hard time.

573
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:28,193
That sight of my ex-wife walking with her boyfriend keeps...

574
00:46:30,904 --> 00:46:32,304
But I'm going to move on.

575
00:46:33,364 --> 00:46:34,574
I must pull myself together.

576
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:38,773
Young Joon, you're the only person who cares about me...

577
00:46:40,474 --> 00:46:41,614
He's gone.

578
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:43,943
When did he walk that far?

579
00:46:44,614 --> 00:46:45,844
Is he a race walker or what?

580
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,893
Ms. Kim Ji Ah, I'm leaving for the day, so please cancel everything...

581
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:04,003
What is going on here?

582
00:47:04,103 --> 00:47:06,634
I can't be seeing things because I miss you too much.

583
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:10,773
I told you to just take a day off.

584
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:13,344
And I told you that I'm feeling fine.

585
00:47:13,543 --> 00:47:15,574
Taking a day off for an in-depth examination when I'm really fine...

586
00:47:15,614 --> 00:47:16,773
is considered special treatment.

587
00:47:16,813 --> 00:47:18,143
And what's wrong with it?

588
00:47:18,414 --> 00:47:19,914
Why do you hate it so much?

589
00:47:20,014 --> 00:47:22,353
Did your family go bankrupt because of special treatment or what?

590
00:47:22,414 --> 00:47:25,554
My family was never even well-off enough to go bankrupt.

591
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:27,094
Don't smile.

592
00:47:27,293 --> 00:47:28,824
You're getting on my nerves today.

593
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:36,693
What happened?

594
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:38,634
Is Mr. Lee unhappy about something?

595
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:40,673
No, don't mind him.

596
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:44,503
I guess even you don't know what ticked him off.

597
00:47:45,773 --> 00:47:48,943
You see, Mr. Lee is overly sensitive.

598
00:47:49,373 --> 00:47:51,744
We say that he's a perfectionist because he's our boss,

599
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,853
but I'd hate to date a guy like him.

600
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,054
Is that why he's single?

601
00:47:57,824 --> 00:47:58,923
Sorry?

602
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:04,563
I heard that he's never been in a real relationship.

603
00:48:05,393 --> 00:48:07,634
No wonder. Who'd put up with his personality?

604
00:48:08,164 --> 00:48:09,994
He's so sensitive and full of himself.

605
00:48:11,003 --> 00:48:14,103
I don't like guys who are show-offs...

606
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:23,410
I heard that he's never been in a real relationship.

607
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,519
No wonder. Who'd put up with his personality?

608
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:28,819
He's so sensitive and full of himself.

609
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,919
I don't like guys who are show-offs...

610
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,629
What... What's wrong, Ms. Kim?

611
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:41,899
Sorry?

612
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,540
Well, I was just...

613
00:48:45,899 --> 00:48:48,470
Oh, have you finished the weekly report?

614
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,540
No, not yet.

615
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:53,040
What about the schedule and the plan for the second half of the year?

616
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:56,549
- I'll take care of it right away. - Good. Finish them quickly.

617
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,220
I also don't like men who are show-offs,

618
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,689
but I equally dislike women who slack off.

619
00:49:02,749 --> 00:49:03,859
Okay.

620
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:15,229
Worrying about her might actually kill me if she faints again.

621
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,169
If I die, it'll be too big of a loss to Korea as well as to the world.

622
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:25,080
Gosh, look at that. She's obviously exhausted.

623
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,379
Is there anything I can do to make her get some rest?

624
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,490
My brain, which is as sexy as my body, are you listening?

625
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,549
Yes, Master. I'm listening.

626
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,260
It is listening.

627
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,729
I know you already work three times harder than others do,

628
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:46,499
but can you bring your A game and try to come up with a good idea?

629
00:50:05,749 --> 00:50:06,850
Is it good?

630
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:09,589
Hello, sir.

631
00:50:09,689 --> 00:50:11,419
Is the meeting with the executives already finished?

632
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:12,890
That's obviously why I'm back.

633
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,060
Oh, can you heat up the herbal medicine I brought this morning?

634
00:50:17,129 --> 00:50:20,100
Sure, I'll heat it up exactly for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

635
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,600
Thank you.

636
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,069
Oh, right. It's very good for boosting energy and...

637
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,310
I mean, it's very expensive, so be careful not to waste even a drop.

638
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,280
Yes, sir. Please don't worry.

639
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,419
My gosh, is it because this herbal medicine is expensive?

640
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,290
I can already feel it.

641
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,859
Cheer up, Park Yoo Shik.

642
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,700
I'll forget everything and start afresh.

643
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:00,240
What should I do, sir?

644
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,810
Why? What happened? What trouble did you cause this time?

645
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,109
Well...

646
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:06,080
I drank...

647
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,910
- your herbal medicine. - What?

648
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:11,580
Then what's this?

649
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,620
That's my herbal medicine for weight loss.

650
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,760
"Weight loss aid and appetite suppressant".

651
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:28,499
I wonder if there's herbal medicine that reduces annoyance...

652
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:29,799
and suppresses anger.

653
00:51:29,899 --> 00:51:31,870
- I don't think so. - Really?

654
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,410
At the moment, I'm in desperate need of such herbal medicine.

655
00:51:42,109 --> 00:51:43,180
(Mr. Park's acquaintance, Choi Seo Jin's birthday)

656
00:51:44,379 --> 00:51:47,490
Sir, I'm sorry, but who is Choi Seo Jin?

657
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:50,419
The name sounds so familiar.

658
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,189
Well, why do you ask?

659
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,459
A reminder popped up about that person's birthday, which is today.

660
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,560
It says that person is your acquaintance.

661
00:51:57,859 --> 00:51:59,700
I should send flowers, right?

662
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,600
- You don't need to send anything. - Really?

663
00:52:03,939 --> 00:52:06,899
I put it on the calendar, so it must be someone important.

664
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,339
She was...

665
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:10,209
an important person to me.

666
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,280
She's my ex-wife.

667
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:18,080
I'm sorry, sir.

668
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:21,450
Gosh, don't be.

669
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,890
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

670
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,260
If you still have feelings for her, you should send flowers...

671
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,930
Gosh, what are you talking about?

672
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:32,160
You saw it too. My ex-wife has a boyfriend now.

673
00:52:33,669 --> 00:52:35,700
I'm sure he'll do something special for her birthday.

674
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,439
You should get back to work.

675
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,669
Yes. I will, sir.

676
00:52:57,019 --> 00:52:59,990
- The spa at the hotel? - Yes.

677
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,430
Go to the spa now with everyone on the team and enjoy the services.

678
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,530
Yes. I will, sir.

679
00:53:05,729 --> 00:53:07,430
But we're supposed to be working now.

680
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:08,999
It is part of your work.

681
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,339
I need your feedback on the spa at Illusion Hotel.

682
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:15,669
Please experience the services and give me your honest feedback.

683
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,540
Okay. No problem, sir.

684
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,640
Then I'll take everyone on the team...

685
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,780
except for Ms. Kim Mi So, who should be at your aid.

686
00:53:22,979 --> 00:53:26,649
Didn't I just say everyone from the Office of Vice Chairman?

687
00:53:27,819 --> 00:53:30,720
That includes Ms. Kim.

688
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:32,620
Okay. I got it, sir.

689
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:36,560
Then we will leave right away with everyone, including Ms. Kim.

690
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,339
You are done with the whole body circulation care.

691
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:53,240
We will prepare the gypsum pack.

692
00:53:54,049 --> 00:53:55,080
Okay.

693
00:53:57,879 --> 00:54:00,180
It's my first time to come to a hotel spa.

694
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,890
Our skin is going to become so nice.

695
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,189
My skin is already like honey, so I don't need it to be better.

696
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,859
When my date looks at me, his eyes are as sweet as honey.

697
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,129
Your date? Are you seeing someone?

698
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,399
Yes.

699
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,240
He's a superhero-like man who always rescues me...

700
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
whenever I am in trouble.

701
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,910
By the way, I don't like it when a guy helps me...

702
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:27,049
because it feels like he's treating me like a child.

703
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,680
What's your type, Ms. Kim?

704
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,780
I...

705
00:54:35,549 --> 00:54:39,060
I like someone who is very considerate and warm.

706
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,760
Mr. Lee.

707
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,959
Someone who is the opposite of Mr. Lee.

708
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:50,600
Why? Mr. Lee is considerate...

709
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,899
and warm too.

710
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,399
Warm?

711
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,540
- Excuse me. - Okay.

712
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,080
(Mr. Lee)

713
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,109
(Mr. Lee)

714
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:00,649
Ms. Kim, are you having a good time?

715
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,850
(Vice President Lee Young Joon)

716
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,589
Thanks to you, I am.

717
00:55:08,689 --> 00:55:12,660
I will check thoroughly so we can give a thorough feedback.

718
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,430
Don't check thoroughly. Just leave it and take some rest.

719
00:55:16,729 --> 00:55:18,729
I sent you there so that you can have a good rest.

720
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,330
It's a privilege to let you rest alone.

721
00:55:21,499 --> 00:55:23,569
But this benefits my entire staff.

722
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:32,680
(Thank you.)

723
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,120
Thank you.

724
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,229
Oh, dear.

725
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,560
I got ambushed again.

726
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,269
She could've sent a heart that's empty inside.

727
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,299
But instead, she sent a heart that's completely filled inside.

728
00:55:57,499 --> 00:56:00,510
Does it mean she is filled with love for me?

729
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:12,680
I am a man of a great scale. So I am sending you two hearts.

730
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:20,930
Ms. Kim, who are you talking to?

731
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:22,930
It's nobody.

732
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,999
What do you mean it's nobody?

733
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,560
I saw your eyes.

734
00:56:27,169 --> 00:56:28,669
- It looked like it was Mr. Lee. - My goodness.

735
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:33,299
Is he making you work again? That's so like him.

736
00:56:33,299 --> 00:56:34,870
Why can't he just let her rest?

737
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:38,879
See? You said he's considerate and warm, but he's not.

738
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,790
This is so good.

739
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,260
Steak is really good even when you eat it alone.

740
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,580
What is this?

741
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,879
You like their steak.

742
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:16,310
So you always come here on our anniversaries and birthdays.

743
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,319
I made you a steak cake so that you can eat as much as you want.

744
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:24,160
No way.

745
00:57:24,189 --> 00:57:26,959
What are you doing? Make a wish and blow out the candles.

746
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:46,310
Is it because I took the appetite suppressant Ms. Seol gave me?

747
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,379
I don't have any appetite.

748
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:52,249
Why did I come here alone like a pathetic?

749
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:00,990
Hey.

750
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:03,899
Yoo Shik.

751
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:07,200
What a coincidence.

752
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:12,569
I actually...

753
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:16,510
thought I'd be able to see you when I come here.

754
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,379
You are a very cruel woman.

755
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:29,319
- What? - Well...

756
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:32,319
I understand that you are dating another man...

757
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,629
now that we've split up.

758
00:58:33,729 --> 00:58:35,930
But you can't bring him here.

759
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,330
We used to come here together every year.

760
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:41,530
Isn't it a rude thing to do to me and also to your new boyfriend?

761
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,600
- He's not my boyfriend. - Then?

762
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,970
Then is he...

763
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,169
Is he your husband?

764
00:58:50,709 --> 00:58:54,180
You already remarried without telling me?

765
00:58:57,149 --> 00:58:59,319
- He's my cousin. - Right, of course he's your cousin.

766
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:05,560
Cousin?

767
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,359
Hello, cousin.

768
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:11,430
Hello.

769
00:59:11,859 --> 00:59:14,299
I will use the restroom.

770
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:15,700
Okay.

771
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,850
Why do you push me into a corner when you don't know anything?

772
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,049
Why are so thoughtless?

773
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,450
"Thoughtless"?

774
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:40,290
I'm sure you didn't know, but today is my birthday.

775
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:44,660
Thank you for making my birthday a happy one.

776
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,769
Seo Jin. Seo...

777
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,410
I knew it was your birthday.

778
01:00:01,479 --> 01:00:02,879
That's why I came here.

779
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,799
(Yumyung Land Guide Map)

780
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:20,370
Why are you looking at the Yumung Land guide map?

781
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:25,999
I'm sure you are looking at it for a reason.

782
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,310
Was I being thoughtless?

783
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:30,040
I am sorry if I was.

784
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,410
There's no need to apologize.

785
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,979
Right. Actually, it's not something to apologize for.

786
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:38,979
I was really thoughtless.

787
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:40,890
Why do you keep saying "thoughtless"?

788
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:45,089
I accidentally ran into my ex-wife a while ago.

789
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,060
And she said I was thoughtless.

790
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,399
Actually, I was thoughtless.

791
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,870
What are you talking about? You said you were going to forget her.

792
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:57,640
I was going to forget her.

793
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:00,040
But I just happened to run into her there.

794
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,040
Never mind.

795
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,740
It was actually thoughtless of me to go there.

796
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:09,979
Mr. Lee.

797
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,919
Never split up with Ms. Kim.

798
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:16,390
Breakup hurts.

799
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:22,189
I just gave you two an advice.

800
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:25,200
That was very thoughtless of me. I was thoughtless.

801
01:01:28,669 --> 01:01:31,470
Mr. Lee, let's drink.

802
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:33,169
I have somewhere to go.

803
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:34,910
With Ms. Kim?

804
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:37,580
Is it me or Ms. Kim?

805
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,310
What are you doing?

806
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:44,819
Come on and drink with me.

807
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,580
I don't want to be alone. It's too lonely.

808
01:01:50,019 --> 01:01:53,220
Okay. I can't let you be lonely alone.

809
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,689
Did you just choose me over Ms. Kim?

810
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:58,459
I can't do that.

811
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,229
You don't have a project after the acquisition of the airline.

812
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,569
Why don't you go have a meeting and get an update...

813
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:04,700
on the present state of the business?

814
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,339
Are you making me work in the midst of this?

815
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:09,339
You said you don't want to be alone.

816
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:10,910
I don't want to work even more.

817
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:17,350
I shouldn't have told you about it.

818
01:02:17,419 --> 01:02:19,680
I was thoughtless. I was really thoughtless.

819
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,049
From now on, call me Mr. Thoughtless, not Mr. Park.

820
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,859
Mr. Thoughtless.

821
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:28,530
Bye.

822
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:40,669
Fine. I am thoughtless.

823
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:42,669
- It feels so nice. - Hello.

824
01:02:42,669 --> 01:02:44,280
- Hello. - Hello.

825
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,080
I feel so refreshed after the spa. All that tension is gone.

826
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,549
It's so lovely.

827
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:53,689
I feel so distracted that I won't be able to work well.

828
01:02:53,689 --> 01:02:55,950
How nice would it be if we can just go home?

829
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:57,689
- We can go drink. - You should go home.

830
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,859
I am sorry, sir. I made a mistake.

831
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:02,990
There's no need to be sorry or to be embarrassed.

832
01:03:03,459 --> 01:03:07,100
Even before you said it, I was already thinking about it.

833
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:10,499
You should all go home and take a good rest.

834
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:13,399
No.

835
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,140
We already wasted half a day at the spa.

836
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,910
Since you made us feel much better,

837
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,280
we will work very hard.

838
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,280
It's all right. You should go home.

839
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,249
You need days like this to increase your work efficiency.

840
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:29,089
I will increase my work efficiency right now.

841
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:30,560
Just...

842
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,490
increase it tomorrow.

843
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:38,930
Should we then?

844
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:44,240
Then for Mr. Lee who has worked hard to boost the morale of his staff...

845
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:46,799
Please.

846
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:49,069
If you clap your hands for every small favor I do,

847
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:50,810
your hands won't last.

848
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,379
You should all go home then.

849
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:55,950
Ms. Kim, stay behind and talk to me for a while.

850
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:57,950
Okay, sir.

851
01:04:02,049 --> 01:04:03,120
Go home.

852
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,690
- Bye. - See you tomorrow.

853
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:06,359
- Thank you. - Bye.

854
01:04:15,347 --> 01:04:17,816
Don't be mistaken, Ms. Kim. This is not a privilege either.

855
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:19,787
I let everyone go home early.

856
01:04:20,626 --> 01:04:23,256
Today is fine, but don't do this again tomorrow.

857
01:04:23,256 --> 01:04:24,626
I am really fine.

858
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:28,296
How are you feeling?

859
01:04:29,097 --> 01:04:30,396
I feel good, thanks to you.

860
01:04:30,836 --> 01:04:32,296
Then let's go somewhere with me.

861
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:33,737
Where?

862
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:43,916
You should go home too, Mr. Yang.

863
01:04:44,077 --> 01:04:45,677
I have somewhere to go with Ms. Kim.

864
01:04:49,546 --> 01:04:51,487
Everyone went home early today.

865
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:53,517
Okay.

866
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:56,586
Take care.

867
01:05:03,296 --> 01:05:05,137
Everyone must've left.

868
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,166
Ms. Bong must've left too.

869
01:05:18,517 --> 01:05:21,416
By the way, why did you want to come here?

870
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:24,186
I wanted to show this to you.

871
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:36,597
It was exactly this spot.

872
01:05:37,936 --> 01:05:39,037
That house.

873
01:05:41,836 --> 01:05:43,606
I mean that place we had been locked up inside.

874
01:05:47,307 --> 01:05:48,506
How do you know that?

875
01:05:48,976 --> 01:05:51,717
I just felt like finding out, so I went through...

876
01:05:52,217 --> 01:05:53,646
aerial photographs, old cadastral data,

877
01:05:54,316 --> 01:05:56,546
and even the old maps of Yumyung Land.

878
01:05:59,117 --> 01:06:00,856
And it turned out to be here.

879
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:02,756
This merry-go-round.

880
01:06:05,756 --> 01:06:08,597
Can you guess what the first thing that came to mind was?

881
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:11,997
"Thank goodness."

882
01:06:15,836 --> 01:06:18,037
I thought the horrible memory...

883
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,476
could be covered up by the happy memories...

884
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:25,247
of the people who ride this merry-go-round.

885
01:06:27,947 --> 01:06:29,016
You're right.

886
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:32,917
Now this place is filled with only happy memories...

887
01:06:33,627 --> 01:06:35,726
instead of a painful memory.

888
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,346
And there is one more place I want to show you.

889
01:06:57,776 --> 01:06:58,947
Why here?

890
01:06:59,117 --> 01:07:01,247
Do you want to throw a coin and make a wish?

891
01:07:02,316 --> 01:07:04,216
Your wish had already come true.

892
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:07,926
You found the boy you were desperately looking for.

893
01:07:09,457 --> 01:07:10,497
You're right.

894
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,997
You've been curious about it.

895
01:07:12,997 --> 01:07:15,167
Where your old house used to be.

896
01:07:16,596 --> 01:07:17,697
Then...

897
01:07:20,037 --> 01:07:21,167
It's here.

898
01:07:24,806 --> 01:07:25,837
Really?

899
01:07:28,776 --> 01:07:31,346
It's fascinating that this used to be my house.

900
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:36,917
Like you said,

901
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:40,157
I am so glad that it's not a toilet or a haunted house.

902
01:07:46,157 --> 01:07:47,367
You wouldn't know.

903
01:07:48,127 --> 01:07:52,436
You wouldn't know how much it means to me...

904
01:07:53,266 --> 01:07:55,007
that we can talk about that time so casually.

905
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:12,056
We will always be happy.

906
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:15,087
We will always be together.

907
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,207
It really enjoyed today, Mr. Lee.

908
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:37,917
I know.

909
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:40,787
How could you not enjoy it when you were with me?

910
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:44,316
So stop saying those obvious things.

911
01:08:44,957 --> 01:08:46,926
It will just tire your mouth.

912
01:08:49,127 --> 01:08:50,726
Thank you.

913
01:08:52,157 --> 01:08:54,096
Then I will go home now.

914
01:09:01,636 --> 01:09:03,636
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

915
01:09:10,476 --> 01:09:13,547
The air is good, and you must want to take a walk with me.

916
01:09:15,016 --> 01:09:16,417
Do you want me to grant you that wish right now?

917
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:22,457
It's an honor.

918
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:43,247
How do you like your first freezie?

919
01:09:44,976 --> 01:09:47,417
It's just frozen food coloring with sugar.

920
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,117
But it's quite tasty.

921
01:09:50,316 --> 01:09:53,827
The downside is that you taste rubber from time to time.

922
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:00,697
Ms. Kim.

923
01:10:02,697 --> 01:10:04,636
Let's go to my place tonight.

924
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:07,707
What do you mean?

925
01:10:08,507 --> 01:10:10,306
I don't want you to be alone.

926
01:10:13,747 --> 01:10:17,547
I suffered from severe aftereffects after that incident.

927
01:10:19,276 --> 01:10:21,316
Every night, I thought of that woman,

928
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:22,747
so I couldn't sleep.

929
01:10:23,216 --> 01:10:24,816
Even when I fell asleep, I suffered from nightmares.

930
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:29,356
I am worried that you might suffer from nightmares like me.

931
01:10:29,987 --> 01:10:33,556
That's why I don't want you to be alone tonight.

932
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:39,636
Thank you.

933
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:43,037
But I am fine.

934
01:10:46,537 --> 01:10:50,106
Actually, I don't remember that time too clearly.

935
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:52,247
I was so young.

936
01:10:54,587 --> 01:10:57,886
I just know that I thought of a dead person...

937
01:10:58,316 --> 01:11:01,657
as a giant spider.

938
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:05,026
It's not too hard to bear.

939
01:11:06,297 --> 01:11:07,327
So...

940
01:11:08,127 --> 01:11:10,497
I will tell you when it gets too unbearable.

941
01:11:11,737 --> 01:11:12,837
When I do,

942
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:16,237
you will protect me like you did in the past, right?

943
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:21,247
Of course, I will protect you.

944
01:11:23,476 --> 01:11:26,047
But if you get scared by any chance, call me right away.

945
01:11:26,676 --> 01:11:28,547
I will wait for your call all night.

946
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:54,176
("Every Moment Was You")

947
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:05,957
("Every Moment Was You")

948
01:12:08,026 --> 01:12:09,987
My every moment was you.

949
01:12:14,896 --> 01:12:16,367
When I loved,

950
01:12:19,037 --> 01:12:20,436
and also when I was in pain.

951
01:12:21,707 --> 01:12:23,676
Even at our moment of farewell,

952
01:12:26,106 --> 01:12:27,846
you were the whole world to me,

953
01:12:29,476 --> 01:12:30,846
and every moment was you.

954
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:35,886
Without you,

955
01:12:38,757 --> 01:12:42,686
I don't think I can explain the story of my life so far.

956
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:55,396
Who is it?

957
01:13:58,297 --> 01:13:59,367
Who is it?

958
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:01,136
It's me.

959
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:04,877
Mr. Lee?

960
01:14:08,176 --> 01:14:09,846
Why are you back?

961
01:14:10,176 --> 01:14:12,146
- Because you said no. - Sorry?

962
01:14:12,547 --> 01:14:14,487
You said you don't want to go to my place,

963
01:14:14,487 --> 01:14:16,247
so I'm going to sleep at your place.

964
01:14:19,117 --> 01:14:20,287
Let me sleep by your side tonight.

965
01:14:29,896 --> 01:14:32,396
(We'd like to thank Son Sung Yoon for her guest appearance.)

966
01:14:52,216 --> 01:14:54,587
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

967
01:14:55,087 --> 01:14:57,426
After having a glass of wine while enjoying the night air...

968
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,226
Wait, we'd need a wine opener.

969
01:14:59,226 --> 01:15:00,226
Just a moment.

970
01:15:01,596 --> 01:15:03,197
- Do you know this, Ms. Kim? - What?

971
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:05,197
That bottle of wine costs 20,000 dollars.

972
01:15:05,497 --> 01:15:08,167
You look very uncomfortable now.

973
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:11,976
I had a very hard time after that incident.

974
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:16,606
Thinking that you might be experiencing the same fear...

975
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:18,377
I stayed up all night.

976
01:15:19,316 --> 01:15:20,386
Ms. Kim.

977
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:22,886
I can't promise you that I'll hold myself back tonight.
