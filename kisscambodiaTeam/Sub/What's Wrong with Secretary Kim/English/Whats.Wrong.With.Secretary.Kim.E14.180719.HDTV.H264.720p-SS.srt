1
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:37,122
Mr. Lee.

2
00:00:58,203 --> 00:00:59,673
You should get ready to go to work.

3
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:06,212
I never knew that shirt was so dangerous.

4
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,313
What do you mean dangerous?

5
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:13,423
That shirt could make the board members...

6
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,823
remove me from office for neglecting my duties.

7
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:36,573
You look so beautiful that I don't want to go to work today.

8
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:40,752
This shirt shakes my composure and self-control.

9
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:45,123
These days,

10
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:48,252
you don't look like the person I used to know.

11
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:50,623
What do you mean?

12
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:54,933
It means I like you much more.

13
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:02,272
But you still should get ready for work.

14
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:19,353
(Episode 14)

15
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:20,622
Thank you.

16
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:35,802
Here.

17
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:50,112
Until now, I've lived with a perfect appearance,

18
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:52,082
physical strength, and competence.

19
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:55,293
Now I plan on becoming considerate too.

20
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:57,062
Why won't you let me?

21
00:02:57,592 --> 00:02:59,092
What do you mean?

22
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,932
Just a while ago,

23
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,233
I fixed you the salad.

24
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:05,802
Did you?

25
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:09,103
These days, your sweetness exceeds the limit.

26
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:12,543
I wish you could give me a chance...

27
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:14,612
to take care of you too sometimes.

28
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:18,112
It feels a bit awkward.

29
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:20,282
It must be due to my job.

30
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:22,853
I'm used to being the one taking care of others no matter where I go.

31
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,353
I also have a work-related habit.

32
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,793
I'm used to being taken care of no matter where I go.

33
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:31,263
But even so...

34
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:34,462
I'm trying my best...

35
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:36,633
to take care of you.

36
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,973
Of course, I'm the type of person who is overwhelmingly elegant,

37
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,342
so I know it'll be hard to ask favors of me.

38
00:03:46,802 --> 00:03:48,812
Even so, I want you to ask me to do things for you,

39
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,913
and ask me for help sometimes too.

40
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,913
I'll allow that to you.

41
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:58,182
All right, I understand.

42
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:04,823
But your face says, "No, I don't understand."

43
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,873
- Which day do you want, Ms. Bong? - I'll take this day.

44
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:19,743
The 28th, 29th, and 30th are perfect.

45
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:20,873
- Yes. - I see.

46
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,113
What are you doing?

47
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:24,383
We're picking our summer vacation days.

48
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:26,953
You've already chosen yours at your previous department, right?

49
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:28,553
When are your days off?

50
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:30,323
I don't take a vacation.

51
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:33,253
Because going to sleep knowing that my work is finished...

52
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:35,953
is the only kind of break I need.

53
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,323
You sure say things like that a lot.

54
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:50,032
Good morning, Mr. Lee.

55
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:57,912
Ms. Kim!

56
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:00,652
Are you not able to take time off this summer again?

57
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,352
No, Ms. Kim doesn't need time off...

58
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:04,883
since she'll be quitting soon.

59
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:07,123
Yes, according to my amazing memory...

60
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:08,623
that got me through a prestigious university,

61
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:11,092
she only has a week left until she leaves.

62
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:15,893
You're right.

63
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:19,503
- What a shame. - What a shame.

64
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,972
I'd completely forgotten...

65
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,883
that I'll be quitting soon.

66
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:39,282
(Vice Chairman Lee Young Joon)

67
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,292
We worked together for nine years.

68
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,363
From the moment I started in business management until now.

69
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,292
We work fully in sync with one another,

70
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:51,503
so if you suddenly quit, then I...

71
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:54,803
You what?

72
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,172
will be hugely inconvenienced.

73
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:02,912
He'll probably tell me to stay again, right?

74
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:07,282
And he might be more insistent this time, since he's in bulldozer mode.

75
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:12,953
Hello.

76
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:15,152
I've got a copy of the agreement from the operations team.

77
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,352
Thank you.

78
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:32,402
This is the revised agreement that you renegotiated in Paris.

79
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:33,972
The legal team has finished looking it over,

80
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:35,972
and they've included clauses to prevent them...

81
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:37,643
from requesting more changes.

82
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,813
You get work done in a perfect way,

83
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:43,352
just like my own facial features. Right?

84
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:44,652
Right.

85
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,352
What are my plans for lunch?

86
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:50,263
You're to have lunch...

87
00:06:50,263 --> 00:06:52,422
at your acquaintance's restaurant, which opened not long ago.

88
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,363
Come with me and we can eat together then.

89
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,162
Me?

90
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:00,303
I want to introduce them to you.

91
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,602
Yes, sir. I will get ready.

92
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,943
There are so many charming and pretty restaurants here.

93
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:11,443
Yes.

94
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:13,912
I thought it'd be in an upscale neighborhood like Cheongdam-dong,

95
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:17,482
since you said this place was run by your acquaintance.

96
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:19,883
They're pretty peculiar.

97
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:22,123
They were originally the heir of Jinyoung Group,

98
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:23,393
but they gave that up.

99
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:26,263
The heir of Jinyoung Group?

100
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:28,592
Are you two close?

101
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:30,633
Our parents know each other,

102
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,133
so we've been close since we were young.

103
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,373
And we studied management in the States together as well.

104
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:37,842
You must be happy to see them for the first time in a while.

105
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:40,172
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

106
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,113
There it is.

107
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:50,222
(Pasta)

108
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:56,792
Young Joon!

109
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,763
- How have you been? - Goodness, how long has it been?

110
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:04,832
You're looking good.

111
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,602
No, I've always looked good.

112
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:09,332
Oh please.

113
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,972
He called the heir a "peculiar fellow",

114
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:15,542
so I thought that it was definitely a man, but it was a woman.

115
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,412
By the way, who's this?

116
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:21,352
She's my girlfriend.

117
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:25,253
Girlfriend?

118
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,693
Hello, I'm Kim Mi So.

119
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:33,633
I'm Jung Yoo Mi.

120
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:36,633
I've been friends with Young Joon since he was five years old,

121
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:38,162
but it's the first time he's ever introduced a girlfriend to me,

122
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:39,702
so this is really fascinating.

123
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:44,072
Goodness, you're so pretty.

124
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:45,643
Of course.

125
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:48,542
She's a perfect woman who can match my own perfect appearance perfectly.

126
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:51,083
And you're still as narcissistic as ever, I see.

127
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:52,983
Do you still do this nowadays?

128
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:54,713
"Aura!"

129
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,583
I don't do it in such a silly way.

130
00:08:58,223 --> 00:09:00,192
I say "my cool aura" like this...

131
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:01,623
in a completely dignified way.

132
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:03,723
That still looks as funny as ever.

133
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:05,363
Right? Isn't it totally funny?

134
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,162
Yes, well...

135
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:11,802
I see, so he did it in front of other women too?

136
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:13,802
Let's head inside.

137
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,312
Eat it while it's still hot.

138
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,552
Thank you for the food.

139
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:33,452
I'm really glad that you're dating someone.

140
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:37,363
You didn't date any girls at all,

141
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:41,363
so I was worried that you liked me.

142
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:47,702
Why would you have such a baseless and ludicrous concern?

143
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:50,942
Come on, you asked me to marry you once too.

144
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:56,243
It was when we were five years old.

145
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:01,583
I see. You two seem to share many memories together.

146
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,522
Excuse me, can we get more pickles?

147
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,723
Yes, just a moment.

148
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:11,522
Gosh, it's a bit cold in here.

149
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,003
Why are you looking at me like that?

150
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:20,032
Like what?

151
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:23,873
You're looking at my face, which should elicit a huge smile,

152
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,503
with a hardened expression.

153
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:27,743
No, that's not true.

154
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,383
You seem to have been quite an open person as a child, though.

155
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:36,652
An open person? What makes you think that?

156
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:41,353
You proposed marriage to her when you were merely five years old.

157
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,093
It seems like you were a bit reckless.

158
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:51,302
You also asked me to marry you when you were five years old.

159
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:54,572
I'm not the same as you though, Mr. Lee!

160
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:56,973
I asked you to marry me because I was a child...

161
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:59,343
harboring innocent feelings toward an older boy who rescued me.

162
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:00,513
But, for you, Mr. Lee...

163
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,613
it was just a pick-up line.

164
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:04,883
A pick-up line?

165
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:17,363
Are you jealous, Ms. Kim?

166
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:19,422
What? Jealous?

167
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,133
I'm not a child, so why would I be jealous?

168
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,633
How ludicrous.

169
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:26,432
Goodness.

170
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,542
I asked you to let me take care of you sometimes.

171
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:41,452
I'm not used to it.

172
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:45,552
Gosh.

173
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:47,922
Here you go.

174
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,192
Open this for me.

175
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:55,993
If you're going to boss me around, pay me.

176
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:58,032
I earn millions of dollars per hour,

177
00:11:58,032 --> 00:11:59,633
so pay me accordingly.

178
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,603
Give me a break. Gosh, I want to smack you.

179
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:03,902
Hurry up and do it for me.

180
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,763
Well? Do you think my restaurant will be successful?

181
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:30,733
I don't think you'll have trouble paying rent, at the very least.

182
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,003
That's a relief.

183
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:35,833
Just a moment.

184
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,873
You must really like her.

185
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:43,843
Your face is shining with love for her.

186
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:45,282
Really?

187
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:48,452
Before, my face was shining only with a fatal kind of handsomeness...

188
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:49,952
but now there's also love here now, I see.

189
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,383
Goodness.

190
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:54,123
Anyway, you seem happy.

191
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:57,493
You seem happy too. Is it because you're doing what you want to do?

192
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,692
Honestly, thinking about inheriting the company stressed me out.

193
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:05,402
And I kept thinking that that wasn't the life I wanted.

194
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,733
I'm sure that others have a hard time understanding my choice,

195
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,003
but I really am content.

196
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:13,103
While doing the kind of work I want to do,

197
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:15,072
I'm happy to live as my true self.

198
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,902
Young Joon, can you open this for me?

199
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,202
Come on.

200
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:50,383
Can you open this for me, honey?

201
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,893
What... What did you just say?

202
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,822
Can you open this for me, honey?

203
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,393
Hold on.

204
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:10,802
Let me record this. Can you say it again?

205
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:12,363
I need to record this.

206
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,532
You said you wanted to take care of me.

207
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,143
I'm giving you a chance now.

208
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:22,572
But you said you weren't used to getting help earlier.

209
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:24,682
I need to keep trying to get used to it.

210
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,213
Oh, right. Don't "aura"...

211
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,853
in front of me from now on.

212
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:33,182
It's not funny at all.

213
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:39,593
I want to save this.

214
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:42,932
- Save what? - Your behavior right now.

215
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,263
I didn't have the desire to possess even the great artwork,

216
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:49,772
but I'd like to keep your jealousy so much right now.

217
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,542
Goodness. I've never been jealous.

218
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:56,013
Why are you smiling?

219
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:57,682
It's cute to see you jealous.

220
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:00,042
I'm not jealous.

221
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,013
- You jealous girl. - I'm not.

222
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:04,983
- You jealous bulldozer. - I said I'm not.

223
00:15:06,223 --> 00:15:08,552
Goodness, seriously.

224
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,123
I can't believe this.

225
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,133
Your bag seems heavy.

226
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,373
You want your honey to carry it for you?

227
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:24,042
What's wrong with you?

228
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,613
You seem to have a problem walking.

229
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,213
Should your honey carry you on the back?

230
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,143
Stop it now.

231
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:34,853
Goodness.

232
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:37,522
You seem very upset.

233
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:38,983
Should your honey appease you?

234
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:42,322
Well, I shouldn't have said that.

235
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:43,822
Let's just go back to the old way.

236
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,363
Mi So, go with your honey.

237
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,873
("Once in a Life Time")

238
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:15,123
It's great to go shopping with my eldest son in a while.

239
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:16,963
I enjoyed it too.

240
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:19,993
Goodness.

241
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,833
Your dad must've been reading your novel.

242
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:30,032
But he seems to have fallen asleep only after reading a few pages.

243
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,702
You have to say he was really into it if he read that much.

244
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:35,873
He usually can't read more than five pages.

245
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:41,282
It's mysterious how in the world he ran his company.

246
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,652
That's why he's said to be the least competitive...

247
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:45,753
among all the chairmans so far.

248
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:05,902
Mr. Yang.

249
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,012
Why did you want to see me?

250
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:12,212
Let's go watch a musical together if you're free tonight.

251
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:15,712
I got tickets for "The Phantom of Ball".

252
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:18,783
Gosh, that's what I really wanted to watch.

253
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:22,652
So I clicked the mouse like crazy to get the best seats.

254
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:25,222
Goodness.

255
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:28,033
You got me away from my trouble every time,

256
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:30,363
and you got tickets for us this time?

257
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,656
Why do you get me all the time?

258
00:17:33,063 --> 00:17:36,672
I just have to say that you're my hero.

259
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,043
You're my hero.

260
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:47,427
Why should I take the stairs when it's so hot today?

261
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:49,326
You better watch out.

262
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:52,897
If you make another mistake, your cheeks won't be able to survive.

263
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:54,326
Understand?

264
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,137
Goodness.

265
00:17:58,597 --> 00:17:59,967
You're scary.

266
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:02,506
What did he do wrong...

267
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:04,407
that you're being this harsh on him?

268
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,476
I know.

269
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:09,147
I should report this if there was a company violence prevention center.

270
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:12,177
It's our business, so don't bother.

271
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:13,917
Keep going your way.

272
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:16,986
Right, it's because of my mistake.

273
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:21,026
Okay, then.

274
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:25,256
Well, make sure you tell me if there's anything you want to say...

275
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:27,496
or if you want some drink.

276
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,236
Please be easy on him.

277
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:37,036
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:40,506
I'm okay with dating in the company,

279
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,847
but I want to keep this a secret.

280
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,076
Are you okay?

281
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:47,387
Did it hurt a lot?

282
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:49,847
No.

283
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:53,826
My cheeks are okay, but my heart is broken.

284
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:56,996
I don't know if this is really necessary.

285
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:09,536
Oh, dear. What should I do with my hero?

286
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:23,117
She's definitely got some temper.

287
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:29,157
Hello.

288
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,927
By the way, the vice chairman leaves work alone these days.

289
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:39,536
I know. Mr. Yang might lose his job at this rate.

290
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:42,167
How could you say that?

291
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:45,607
Don't you know how important my Mr. Yang is in this company?

292
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:54,016
"My Mr. Yang"?

293
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:57,917
I mean...

294
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:01,256
Well, he's my college.

295
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:03,857
He isn't someone else's college.

296
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,927
We're colleges, so we should be able to call each other that way.

297
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:09,766
Don't you think so, my Mr. Park?

298
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:13,707
You gave him a hard time just a while ago,

299
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:16,806
why would you pretend like you care for him now?

300
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,707
I usually don't hold grudges, you know.

301
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,907
Please excuse me.

302
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:32,086
It's so hard to understand her.

303
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:34,357
I know your feelings, Mr. Yang.

304
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:37,657
- How about we have a drink... - No, thank you.

305
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,367
Okay.

306
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:43,127
- Want to have a drink? - No, sir.

307
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:50,806
I'll take you to where your dad is hospitalized.

308
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:52,177
Okay.

309
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:54,746
I can go there by bus though.

310
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,217
No, it'll be tiring for my Mi So then.

311
00:20:57,217 --> 00:20:58,947
It's right for your honey to give you a ride.

312
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:01,016
- That's enough. - Okay.

313
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,516
Are you going to stay up all night today as well?

314
00:21:04,756 --> 00:21:08,127
No, it's Mal Hee's turn today, so I am just going there to see his face.

315
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:11,197
You and my sisters-in-law...

316
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:13,867
must be going through a lot to take care of my father-in-law.

317
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:19,097
Your sisters-in-law and father-in-law?

318
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:21,806
Of course.

319
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:24,437
Weren't you going to marry me?

320
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,776
Don't tell me you're taking our relationship lightly.

321
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:30,246
It's not that.

322
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,546
But...

323
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,746
will you be okay to marry me?

324
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:39,117
You've had a fiancee since five years old.

325
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:41,457
- That's enough. - Okay.

326
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,597
You could've just dropped me off and left.

327
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:54,367
I want to stay with you little more.

328
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:59,937
Aren't you going to introduce me to your father today either?

329
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,877
I think it's too early yet.

330
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:10,117
Let's look for a nice timing after he gets discharged.

331
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:13,217
- Dad. - Wait.

332
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:15,256
- It's suffocating. - Gosh, I'm sorry.

333
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:18,026
"Dad"?

334
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:20,996
Hello.

335
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:22,967
Well...

336
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:36,177
I've heard a lot about you from my daughter.

337
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:39,147
I heard you overworked her...

338
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:41,887
without giving any holidays.

339
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:45,857
So I wanted to see you one day, and you're that bossy punk.

340
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:49,786
I mean, her superior.

341
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:52,826
Right, I'm that bossy punk.

342
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:55,127
I mean, her superior.

343
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:57,266
I'm sorry for my late greeting.

344
00:22:57,566 --> 00:22:59,397
Thank you...

345
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:02,506
for upgrading a ward for me.

346
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:05,336
It must be thanks to my daughter's hard work,

347
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:09,147
so I'll accept it delightedly.

348
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:10,516
My pleasure.

349
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,717
And feel free to talk casually to me.

350
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:15,586
No, I shouldn't do that to my daughter's superior.

351
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:16,847
It's okay. Please talk casually...

352
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:19,286
- No, I can't do that. - You can.

353
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:24,226
I'm not sure if I should tell you this at this timing,

354
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:25,897
but actually,

355
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:29,427
I'm dating with your daughter.

356
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:31,796
What?

357
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:35,336
What you meant by dating?

358
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,336
Is it what I think it is?

359
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:39,536
Why are you talking casually to him all of a sudden?

360
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:42,246
Yes, a romantic relationship.

361
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:45,447
We're going out, sir.

362
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:48,046
Goodness, this friend...

363
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:50,717
is quite daring.

364
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:54,157
All right, let me...

365
00:23:54,657 --> 00:23:57,197
tell you straight-forward.

366
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,996
I'm against your relationship with her.

367
00:24:13,677 --> 00:24:15,947
Yes, sir. Please hold.

368
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:20,486
It's Mr. Park on the phone. He needs to ask you something urgently.

369
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,486
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:29,957
Please excuse me for a second.

371
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:38,266
Dad, why are you against it?

372
00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:44,137
The more I see him, the more I like him.

373
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:47,677
What? But you just said you were against it.

374
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:49,276
It's a lie.

375
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:52,276
I'm putting up a show for your sake.

376
00:24:52,877 --> 00:24:53,947
What?

377
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:56,347
That punk must not have expected...

378
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:59,357
that I'd be against him from dating you.

379
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:01,887
He must've thought that I'd welcome him...

380
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:05,526
with all my heart since he's a billionaire.

381
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:10,467
But I know very well about people like him.

382
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:12,996
The more obstacles there are,

383
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,967
the bigger desire he'll have to win you.

384
00:25:18,877 --> 00:25:21,276
Wait and see.

385
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:23,506
He'll be more obsessed over you.

386
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:26,177
What are you talking about?

387
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:29,887
Do you want to go have...

388
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,717
some coffee from a vending machine with me?

389
00:25:33,187 --> 00:25:35,056
- Yes, sir. - Good.

390
00:25:37,256 --> 00:25:38,296
Dad.

391
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:57,117
How much do you know about Mi So?

392
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:01,447
I've worked with her for nine years,

393
00:26:02,286 --> 00:26:03,887
so I know quite a lot.

394
00:26:06,687 --> 00:26:08,127
Mi So...

395
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:11,857
is a good daughter who's never made me worried.

396
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:15,066
She never complained even though she had to wear clothes...

397
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:16,667
handed down from her sisters.

398
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:21,707
She always placed first even though she didn't take any private lessons.

399
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:27,076
She's the youngest, but she's most considerate.

400
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:31,377
When I got scammed by my own friend...

401
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:35,147
and became penniless one day.

402
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:38,316
Unfortunately, that day was...

403
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:42,586
when her college entrance exam result came out.

404
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:47,066
She could've received scholarship and gone to college...

405
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,826
like her sisters.

406
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:50,967
But she insisted...

407
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:53,836
she wouldn't go to college...

408
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,036
and earn money instead.

409
00:26:58,437 --> 00:27:00,877
I was crying hard out of shame.

410
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:04,816
Do you know what that little kid said to me?

411
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:13,726
"It's okay, Dad."

412
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,397
She said that to me with a smile on her face.

413
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,826
She must've cried so much...

414
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:25,167
on the inside when she said that.

415
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:29,266
A corner of my heart still aches...

416
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:34,177
when I see her smile even now.

417
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:37,276
So...

418
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:41,647
even if she smiles brightly,

419
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,187
you shouldn't trust it as is.

420
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:48,786
No matter how hard the trouble is,

421
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,026
she puts up with it with a smiley face.

422
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,397
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

423
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,607
I heard she decided to resign.

424
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:05,407
How much work did you give her...

425
00:28:05,736 --> 00:28:08,147
that such a decent and diligent girl couldn't handle it?

426
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:12,816
I hope...

427
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,347
she becomes happy...

428
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:18,157
by finding what she wants to do...

429
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:20,586
even though it's a bit late now.

430
00:28:33,097 --> 00:28:36,107
Wait here. I'll tell her to come down.

431
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:37,236
Okay.

432
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:41,746
I told you this so that you give her a ride home.

433
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:44,476
Don't think about hanging out with her.

434
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:48,546
I won't. I'll see you next time then.

435
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:15,246
Why do you want to resign without such basic plans?

436
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:18,246
I should go find my life now too.

437
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:22,016
Neither the life as a secretary nor as a head of the household,

438
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:23,617
but my own life.

439
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:26,457
I'm sure that others have a hard time understanding my choice,

440
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:27,586
but I really am content.

441
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:31,796
I'm happy to live as my true self.

442
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:35,326
I hope she becomes happy...

443
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:38,236
she becomes happy by finding what she wants to do...

444
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:40,766
even though it's a bit late now.

445
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:57,417
What's taking them so long? What are they talking about?

446
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:04,127
What did you two talk about for so long?

447
00:30:06,296 --> 00:30:07,427
Where's the vice chairman?

448
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:12,667
We boys had...

449
00:30:12,836 --> 00:30:14,207
a deep conversation.

450
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,207
I managed to maintain his tension...

451
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:18,707
in the meantime.

452
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:24,947
He's waiting for you in the lobby. Go down already.

453
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,357
What's up with that laugh?

454
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:33,256
I can't believe...

455
00:30:33,256 --> 00:30:35,526
my youngest daughter is seeing the vice chairman of Yumyung Group.

456
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:56,647
You've looked so serious on our way home.

457
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:59,617
Or I'm just seriously handsome.

458
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:07,526
Did my dad make any mistake by any chance?

459
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:09,786
That's not it.

460
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:12,897
I was just organizing my thought.

461
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:20,967
Shall we walk a little now that I'm done organizing my thought?

462
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:22,566
Let's go for a walk.

463
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,417
Ms. Kim.

464
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:33,717
Do you still want to resign?

465
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,316
That's right.

466
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,726
What do you plan to do after you resign?

467
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:42,556
I don't know.

468
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:45,657
I haven't figured out the details yet.

469
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,437
I got myself a job as soon as I graduated high school.

470
00:31:54,907 --> 00:31:58,006
I didn't have any chance to think about dreams or interests.

471
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:00,276
I just focused on applying for companies.

472
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:05,217
Ever since then, I was busy earning money that I had no time to think.

473
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:09,717
Actually,

474
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:12,986
I'm not quite sure...

475
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:15,286
what I wanted to do.

476
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:24,967
Then...

477
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,766
take your time...

478
00:32:28,536 --> 00:32:30,236
and think about what you want to do from now on.

479
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:34,947
It's true...

480
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:39,117
I tried to stop you from resigning because I selfishly wanted to...

481
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,516
have you by my side at whatever cost.

482
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:47,756
But I don't see its necessity anymore...

483
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:52,697
because whatever you do, I'll be there with you.

484
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,467
Sir.

485
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,006
For the last nine years,

486
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:04,937
my secretary has been...

487
00:33:05,576 --> 00:33:07,046
always diligent,

488
00:33:07,907 --> 00:33:09,607
perfect, and great.

489
00:33:13,347 --> 00:33:14,746
I should let you go now.

490
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:20,627
Thank you for your hard work.

491

492
00:33:41,347 --> 00:33:42,776
Instead,

493
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:45,447
you have to tell me first when you find out what you want to do.

494
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:49,147
Whatever it is,

495
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:51,217
I'll always root for you and support you.

496
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,157
Okay, I will.

497
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:24,287
Thank you.

498
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:28,756
There's no one else here, right?

499
00:34:29,327 --> 00:34:31,197
Goodness. What now?

500
00:34:31,197 --> 00:34:33,057
What's the matter this time?

501
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:36,697
I'm telling you. We cannot let anyone eavesdrop on this.

502
00:34:36,796 --> 00:34:39,467
It's top secret, okay?

503
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:42,936
Only those who can handle it should gather here.

504
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,336
Come on. Hurry up.

505
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:46,106
What's this big news? What is it about?

506
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:47,907
Is the company's stock price going up?

507
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,916
Mr. Ko, don't mind him.

508
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:54,086
Goodness. Mr. Jung says that all the time,

509
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:57,356
but every single one has turned out to be a false rumor.

510
00:34:57,686 --> 00:34:59,387
This one isn't a false rumor.

511
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,427
There's even a witness.

512
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:05,157
It's from a very credible source.

513
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:07,767
The thing is...

514
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,467
Two people in this office...

515
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:15,767
are dating, and you'll be shocked when I tell you who they are.

516
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:21,177
Don't tell them. Please!

517
00:35:22,907 --> 00:35:25,077
You see, the two people are...

518
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:26,077
Please!

519
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:31,256
Mr. Lee and Ms. Kim are dating.

520
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,356
- Ms. Kim? - Yes.

521
00:35:37,697 --> 00:35:39,427
Really? Are you serious?

522
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:41,097
That can't be.

523
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,796
Who's the witness?

524
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:45,436
The witness. The new hire in Management Support...

525
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:51,977
saw the two of them out on a date and walking hand in hand...

526
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:54,106
- a few days ago. - Oh, my goodness.

527
00:35:54,706 --> 00:35:57,117
- I'm getting goose bumps. - Gosh, it's crazy.

528
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:00,017
Good morning, everyone.

529
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:02,086
- Good morning. - Good morning.

530
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:05,456
Did something exciting happen?

531
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,756
- Yes, we're excited. - Yes!

532
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,356
- We're having a good morning. - Yes.

533
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,526
- Have a good day, everyone. - You too.

534
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:15,697
- Sounds good. - Have a good day.

535
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:16,896
We're so happy.

536
00:36:17,336 --> 00:36:20,037
- Gosh. Hey, we almost got... - Keep it down.

537
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:21,867
We almost got in trouble there.

538
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,006
Well, if the rumor is true,

539
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:26,606
getting on her wrong side means...

540
00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:31,046
We'll be seriously doomed.

541
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:33,947
Totally. We must not get on her wrong side.

542
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:36,617
Oh, Ji Ah.

543
00:36:38,956 --> 00:36:41,756
Do you have Yumyung Bio's sales report ready?

544
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:43,827
Ms. Bong and I have a meeting later today.

545
00:36:45,057 --> 00:36:47,367
Yes, I already printed it and left it on my desk.

546
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,936
- Let's do a good job. - We can do it.

547
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:52,467
- Let's work harder. - Yes, I'll do my best.

548
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:53,467
- Work harder. - Go, team!

549
00:36:57,936 --> 00:36:59,637
This is for the grand opening...

550
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:01,347
of Yumyung Department's Dongseong-ro branch.

551
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:05,247
The grand opening is on the 5th of next month, right?

552
00:37:05,477 --> 00:37:06,517
Yes, sir.

553
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:09,546
Would you like to visit for the final check?

554
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,956
Mr. Park is planning to visit the site next week,

555
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:14,887
so I don't think you'd have to.

556
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:17,756
Then I should listen to you.

557
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:19,956
Okay.

558
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,106
Why are you looking at me like that?

559
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:42,247
Thinking that I can see you here only for a few more days...

560
00:37:43,816 --> 00:37:45,057
is making every moment...

561
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:49,586
even more special.

562
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:55,796
Well, then.

563
00:37:58,137 --> 00:37:59,197
Just a moment.

564
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:23,227
What should we do now?

565
00:38:23,327 --> 00:38:26,296
We've been caught red-handed.

566
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:28,697
They all know now, Ms. Kim.

567
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:31,867
There's only one solution when you can't avoid the problem.

568
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:34,467
Dealing with it head-on.

569
00:38:35,206 --> 00:38:36,467
What exactly are you going to do?

570
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:42,206
What did I...

571
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,717
just see?

572
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:48,586
You saw that, right? What I told you guys is true.

573
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:55,856
Please come in.

574
00:38:56,787 --> 00:38:59,057
It looks like we have to talk.

575
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:13,336
The romantic sight you just witnessed...

576
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:16,077
What you're speculating is true.

577
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:20,787
You all must be very surprised as none of you saw it coming,

578
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:23,986
but it's true that Ms. Kim and I are in a relationship.

579
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:32,097
- Congratulations, sir. - Be happy together!

580
00:39:34,097 --> 00:39:35,296
I really had no idea.

581
00:39:41,566 --> 00:39:44,006
We love each other. What is wrong with that?

582
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:46,907
Tell me if any of you have a problem with it.

583
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,376
Gosh, what are you talking about?

584
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:50,747
Not at all, sir. Do you have a problem with it?

585
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:53,017
Not at all. I don't have any problem with it.

586
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,717
What about... I mean, what about you, Ji Ah?

587
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:58,657
I have no problem with it either. What about you, Ms. Kim?

588
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:03,057
Yes, you'd have no problem with it.

589
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:06,827
Then you can all leave now.

590
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,927
Oh, okay. Have a good day, sir.

591
00:40:18,137 --> 00:40:19,477
This is actually good.

592
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:27,217
I'm embarrassed to ask you this,

593
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:29,816
but would you be able to keep it a secret?

594
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:31,887
It'd be great if it could stay among the three of you.

595
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:37,626
Well... I'm sorry, Ms. Kim.

596
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:41,367
I think everyone in the company is gossiping about it already.

597
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:43,637
Sorry? How...

598
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:47,736
It looks like someone saw the two of you out on a date.

599
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:51,336
That's why we kind of already knew about it.

600
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:52,376
Yes.

601
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:02,617
Yes, Mr. Park. I'm bringing the contract to you now.

602
00:41:10,327 --> 00:41:12,956
- Isn't she that secretary, Ms. Kim? - Yes, it's her.

603
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:14,666
I must say, she is pretty.

604
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:24,836
Have you heard?

605
00:41:25,177 --> 00:41:27,977
Mr. Lee and his secretary, Ms. Kim Mi So, are dating.

606
00:41:28,606 --> 00:41:32,376
Yes, I obviously heard about it. Everyone in the company knows.

607
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:35,287
To be honest, I knew that something was up between those two.

608
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:38,117
She didn't even go to a good school, but she somehow landed that job.

609
00:41:38,117 --> 00:41:40,017
I wondered how she could have such a successful career.

610
00:41:40,787 --> 00:41:42,986
Anyway, I'm just saying I could sense something was up.

611
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:45,956
I'm telling you.

612
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:48,597
I hate girls like her who rely on their looks to get ahead.

613
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:51,137
It's not like I can't use my looks to get ahead.

614
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:52,666
Gosh, she has no class.

615
00:41:53,137 --> 00:41:54,767
- Excuse me. - My gosh.

616
00:41:54,836 --> 00:41:56,506
That was way out of line.

617
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:58,477
Ms. Kim is not that kind of person.

618
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:00,876
That's right.

619
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:03,876
She's the second most perfect person I've seen after Mr. Lee.

620
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:06,677
How can you bad-mouth her like this when you don't even know her well?

621
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,347
Don't you think this is wrong?

622
00:42:09,146 --> 00:42:10,256
What is wrong with you two?

623
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:14,456
Are you teachers or what? Who are you to lecture us?

624
00:42:14,856 --> 00:42:19,557
We can bad-mouth her if we want to. It's none of your business.

625
00:42:19,557 --> 00:42:20,666
That's right.

626
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,867
Are you taking Ms. Kim's side, thinking that...

627
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:25,597
you'll benefit from it if things between her and Mr. Lee go well?

628
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:26,666
How clever.

629
00:42:28,606 --> 00:42:30,907
A secretary who's going all out to seduce Mr. Lee...

630
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:33,006
and her co-workers who curry favor with her to benefit from her.

631
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:35,077
Goodness, birds of a feather flock together indeed.

632
00:42:35,577 --> 00:42:38,276
Gosh, is your mouth rotten or what?

633
00:42:38,276 --> 00:42:39,977
How can you be so rude?

634
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:41,186
"Rotten"?

635
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:44,756
Shall I really teach you a lesson?

636
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,227
- Where's the mop? - Here!

637
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:56,427
- Gosh, go away! - Go away!

638
00:43:03,506 --> 00:43:04,677
Gosh!

639
00:43:14,686 --> 00:43:16,617
- Ms. Bong! - Let go!

640
00:43:18,517 --> 00:43:21,057
What's going on? Ms. Bong. Ji Ah!

641
00:43:23,697 --> 00:43:24,827
What was that about?

642
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:26,697
What happened?

643
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:28,467
My gosh...

644
00:43:29,515 --> 00:43:32,245
My gosh. Ouch, it stings. It stings so badly!

645
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:38,586
I'm so sorry you got hurt like this because of me.

646
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:43,696
You shouldn't have taken it to heart. Why did you put up a fight?

647
00:43:44,366 --> 00:43:46,026
I was so angry.

648
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:48,495
They bad-mouthed you when they don't even know you well.

649
00:43:49,035 --> 00:43:51,006
You've been working so hard.

650
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:52,906
I know that better than anybody else does.

651
00:43:52,906 --> 00:43:54,006
That's right.

652
00:43:54,236 --> 00:43:57,546
You're leaving on a good note after working very hard for years,

653
00:43:57,546 --> 00:43:59,506
but people think that you're quitting to get married...

654
00:44:01,216 --> 00:44:02,975
That's what most people think.

655
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,446
And that also bothers me.

656
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:07,986
Totally. This is putting a dent in your career, for which you've...

657
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:09,886
worked so hard for the past nine years to build.

658
00:44:11,426 --> 00:44:13,995
Anyway, thanks for defending me.

659
00:44:15,555 --> 00:44:16,725
Don't mention it.

660
00:44:17,495 --> 00:44:20,636
You shouldn't make your relationship public when you date a co-worker.

661
00:44:20,636 --> 00:44:22,995
This is precisely why I'm not telling anyone.

662
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:30,035
I mean, from now on.

663
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,305
If I ever end up dating a co-worker,

664
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:33,875
I'll absolutely keep it a secret.

665
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:39,745
Anyhow, how about we tell Mr. Lee everything?

666
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:42,816
Let's send them to the branch in India. We must get back at them.

667
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:46,926
Please don't say anything to Mr. Lee.

668
00:44:47,296 --> 00:44:49,895
I don't want to worry him.

669
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:53,125
You just love him so much, don't you?

670
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:01,875
What? A mop fight?

671
00:45:02,935 --> 00:45:04,906
Yes, Ms. Seol told me about it.

672
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:08,415
A couple of female employees who were bad-mouthing...

673
00:45:10,645 --> 00:45:12,915
I mean, female employees who were speaking ill of Ms. Kim...

674
00:45:13,316 --> 00:45:16,156
and employees from your office who were defending her...

675
00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:17,886
got into a big fight.

676
00:45:18,685 --> 00:45:20,725
Ms. Kim was all out of it, trying to stop the fight.

677
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:24,495
Well, did she get hurt at all?

678
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:27,566
Ms. Kim's feelings must've been hurt.

679
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:31,836
From what I heard, they accused her of seducing you intentionally.

680
00:45:31,836 --> 00:45:33,705
They said harsh things about her.

681
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:38,705
Does she deserve to hear such harsh words just because we're dating?

682
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:42,575
People like to speak ill of others, you know.

683
00:45:42,645 --> 00:45:44,446
But how dare they bad-mouth my girlfriend?

684
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:46,446
They're doing it because she's your girlfriend.

685
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:50,685
She's the vice chairman's girlfriend. Everyone must envy her.

686
00:45:50,926 --> 00:45:52,026
How pathetic.

687
00:45:52,185 --> 00:45:54,055
They should get more work done in that time.

688
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:55,756
We don't pay them to bad-mouth others.

689
00:45:58,995 --> 00:46:00,495
Hey, why? Where are you going?

690
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,535
I'm going to see Ms. Kim to make sure she's okay.

691
00:46:03,165 --> 00:46:04,336
Well, the thing is...

692
00:46:04,705 --> 00:46:07,506
She practically begged everyone...

693
00:46:08,236 --> 00:46:11,745
to keep it from you because you'd be all bothered by it like this.

694
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,046
Then how did I end up hearing about it?

695
00:46:19,316 --> 00:46:21,216
That's what happens with all rumors.

696
00:46:21,216 --> 00:46:23,886
They spread everywhere. You always end up hearing rumors about you,

697
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:25,856
and they drive you all crazy.

698
00:46:27,825 --> 00:46:30,566
She asked everyone not to tell you, so just act like you know nothing.

699
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,736
She must be the one who's most hurt and stressed out now.

700
00:46:37,236 --> 00:46:40,406
I know. That's what's really driving me crazy.

701
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:03,495
- Ms. Kim. - Sir.

702
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:05,566
Get ready to leave for Daegu right away.

703
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:07,196
Right now?

704
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,866
I want to do the final check for the department store's grand opening.

705
00:47:12,435 --> 00:47:14,475
But you said earlier that you won't be going.

706
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:16,906
It looks like I have to go, so get ready quickly.

707
00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:26,345
Hey, what happened?

708
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:28,515
Everyone is talking about how you two got into a fight...

709
00:47:28,586 --> 00:47:31,886
with two other female employees while defending Ms. Kim.

710
00:47:34,225 --> 00:47:35,895
They kept saying rude things...

711
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,995
about Ms. Kim when they don't even know her well.

712
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:44,136
We couldn't let it slide, so Ji Ah and I...

713
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:45,866
ended up tussling with them.

714
00:47:48,035 --> 00:47:50,375
Ms. Bong and Ji Ah, you two are so loyal.

715
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,546
That's what I'm saying.

716
00:47:51,776 --> 00:47:54,845
I'm impressed. I must say, we have such great teamwork.

717
00:47:56,345 --> 00:47:57,446
Are you both...

718
00:47:58,486 --> 00:47:59,716
all right?

719
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,856
Well, we're okay.

720
00:48:04,386 --> 00:48:05,856
I got hurt a little.

721
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:08,455
I got a scrape on my arm.

722
00:48:09,296 --> 00:48:10,395
Gosh, it stings.

723
00:48:23,575 --> 00:48:24,745
I'm okay.

724
00:48:34,886 --> 00:48:37,026
Ms. Bong, open your drawer.

725

(Pain-relieving Patches)

727
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:58,606
I didn't want anyone to find out, so I put them in your drawer secretly.

728
00:48:58,975 --> 00:49:00,075
Don't get hurt like that again.

729
00:49:22,466 --> 00:49:24,906
So will there be no more changes made to the shop's decor?

730
00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:27,676
Yes, sir. We got the final confirmation over the weekend.

731
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:30,035
Since the brand has no stores in Korea yet,

732
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:32,006
the HQ in France must want this to go flawlessly.

733
00:49:32,075 --> 00:49:33,345
Please prepare everything perfectly.

734
00:49:35,776 --> 00:49:37,086
I think we're well prepared.

735
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:40,986
Yes, that's why I told you that you didn't need to visit in person.

736
00:49:42,586 --> 00:49:44,586
The meeting ended earlier than expected. Shall we go on a date?

737
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,256
A date?

738
00:49:48,796 --> 00:49:49,895
Sir.

739
00:50:01,106 --> 00:50:03,676
These steps. They look as beautiful as you are.

740
00:50:08,515 --> 00:50:09,575
Go stand over there.

741
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:12,745
The best photographer, Lee Young Joon, will take a photo of you.

742
00:50:15,856 --> 00:50:16,926
Go on.

743
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:29,066
Kim Mi So, please smile.

744
00:50:35,506 --> 00:50:36,575
That looks great.

745
00:50:39,075 --> 00:50:40,176
Give me your phone.

746
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:51,986
Look at this heart.

747
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:55,625
Shall I make a bigger one?

748
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:14,116
This view reminds me of you.

749
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:16,176
It's flawless.

750
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:19,446
And this observatory is like me.

751
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,386
It's standing on top of the mountain.

752
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:32,526
You brought me here on purpose, didn't you?

753
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:37,035
To make me feel better.

754
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:40,676
That's right.

755
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:43,176
I heard about what happened earlier today.

756
00:51:44,176 --> 00:51:47,546
I brought you here because I wanted to make you feel better.

757
00:51:51,216 --> 00:51:53,145
How about you leave the company sooner than planned?

758
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:56,415
No, I don't want to do that.

759
00:51:57,756 --> 00:52:01,095
I'll do my best and continue to work hard until my last day.

760
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:05,595
People who have nothing to do with me can criticize me all they want...

761
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:07,966
because it doesn't matter to me.

762
00:52:10,636 --> 00:52:11,636
But still...

763
00:52:11,836 --> 00:52:14,075
I am worried that you might get hurt.

764
00:52:15,236 --> 00:52:17,606
When I decided to start a relationship with you,

765
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:19,506
I already expected it to happen.

766
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:24,116
I decided that I wouldn't be hurt even if people find out...

767
00:52:25,816 --> 00:52:27,386
and misunderstand me.

768
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:29,285
I decided not to avoid it.

769
00:52:34,895 --> 00:52:38,095
I wouldn't love you without such determination.

770
00:53:04,825 --> 00:53:07,995
Now, shall we go on a hot date?

771
00:53:10,225 --> 00:53:11,796
A hot date?

(Seomun Market)

773
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:31,845
Is this what you meant by "hot"?

774
00:53:32,316 --> 00:53:34,586
Yes. It's very hot.

775
00:53:34,656 --> 00:53:35,955
Try it.

776
00:53:36,285 --> 00:53:37,656
Come on.

777
00:53:41,095 --> 00:53:42,595
It's going in.

778
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:48,136
How is it?

779
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:53,875
- It's actually nice. - Right?

780
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:03,616
You have some too, Ms. Kim.

781
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:07,986
It's nice, isn't it?

782
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:10,256
- Thank you. - Thank you.

783
00:54:14,725 --> 00:54:16,196
This is lovely, isn't it?

784
00:54:16,455 --> 00:54:17,495
How much is that?

785
00:54:20,136 --> 00:54:21,196
Wait.

786
00:54:22,995 --> 00:54:25,205
I will get that.

787
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:29,475
Thank you.

788
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,805
Here, Ms. Kim.

789
00:54:34,645 --> 00:54:36,915
I told you not to buy it.

790
00:54:37,145 --> 00:54:38,245
Let's go.

791
00:54:58,205 --> 00:54:59,765
Let's not get hurt.

792
00:55:00,606 --> 00:55:01,906

Good morning, everyone.

00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:17,586
It's not a good morning.

We are in big trouble, Ms. Kim.

798
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:21,095
What's wrong?

799
00:55:21,356 --> 00:55:23,625
It seems like someone copied the design of...

800
00:55:23,796 --> 00:55:25,466
our new laptop launching next month.

801
00:55:25,796 --> 00:55:27,495
- What? - Look.

UK Group revealed the design of their new laptop,

803
00:55:29,336 --> 00:55:30,705
which they will be launching next month.

804
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:32,866
It looks exactly the same as our new laptop.

805
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:35,375
Ms. Kim.

806
00:55:37,406 --> 00:55:39,205
Call for a board meeting immediately.

Mr. Lee is here.

809
00:55:48,672 --> 00:55:49,703
Have a seat.

810
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:54,783
We don't have time, so let's go straight to the point.

811
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:56,482
What do you think happened?

812
00:55:56,482 --> 00:56:00,152
UK Electronics is launching a new product in about a month.

813
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,823
They suddenly revealed the design first.

814
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:04,292
It seems like they revealed it earlier because they know...

815
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:05,652
that there will be a plagiarism controversy.

816
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:08,622
Is it possible to change the design now?

817
00:56:08,893 --> 00:56:10,192
That's...

818
00:56:10,562 --> 00:56:12,962
If we change the design now and delay the release,

819
00:56:12,962 --> 00:56:15,002
a line of products for the rest of the year would all fail.

820
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:17,033
Realistically, it's difficult.

821
00:56:17,102 --> 00:56:18,133
What other options do we have?

822
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:21,243
To give it a competitive edge,

823
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:22,902
why don't we lower the price a little?

824
00:56:23,002 --> 00:56:26,372
It hasn't even been released, and you want to lower the price?

825
00:56:26,442 --> 00:56:27,883
Is this a clearance sale?

826
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:30,352
Do you call that an opinion?

827
00:56:34,453 --> 00:56:38,223
If we can't change the design, our function should differ.

828
00:56:39,022 --> 00:56:40,792
Is there any new technology we can borrow from...

829
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:42,522
the line that will be released early next year?

830
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:46,263
Yes, there is. But that will affect the release of the next model.

831
00:56:46,263 --> 00:56:48,402
Do we have a guarantee that there will be next?

832
00:56:49,303 --> 00:56:51,473
Improve the SSD writing speed by 30 percent,

833
00:56:51,473 --> 00:56:53,272
and improve the power consumption by 20 percent.

00:56:53,272 --> 00:56:55,872
Do everything you can and upgrade the quality,

835
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:57,913

00:56:58,672 --> 00:57:00,183

- Ms. Kim. - Ms. Kim.

838
00:57:07,122 --> 00:57:10,053
We just found out about this now.

839
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:12,893
The meeting was held even before we found a countermeasure.

840
00:57:13,192 --> 00:57:16,422
We were just flustered. Please talk to him well.

841
00:57:16,462 --> 00:57:18,332
Don't worry. He must already know.

842
00:57:18,962 --> 00:57:20,633
And within the day, he will ask you about...

843
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:22,663
how you will handle the press.

844
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:25,303
It will be nice if you find out when the design was patented...

845
00:57:25,303 --> 00:57:26,732
and summarize the evidences which might prove...

846
00:57:26,732 --> 00:57:28,102
that they copied our design.

847
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:30,542
- Thank you, Ms. Kim. - Okay. Let's go.

848
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,683
- Mom? - Sir?

849
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:38,953
I am reminded of my mother who used to comfort me...

850
00:57:38,953 --> 00:57:40,652
after I got scolded by my father.

851
00:57:44,723 --> 00:57:47,863
Mr. Ko, please check how each department is doing.

852
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,192
- Yes. - Ms. Bong and Ji Ah,

853
00:57:49,192 --> 00:57:50,433
go to the legal team...

854
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:53,033
and discuss with them about the lawsuits.

855
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:55,263
Mr. Park and Young Ho, attend the meeting of...

856
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,703
the marketing team and get a meeting minutes.

857
00:57:56,832 --> 00:57:59,502
Mr. Jung, please stay on top of everything.

858
00:57:59,502 --> 00:58:00,772
Okay. I will do that.

859
00:58:01,243 --> 00:58:03,002
- Let's go. - Okay.

860
00:58:09,143 --> 00:58:10,783
Mr. Lee. I talked to the development team.

861
00:58:10,783 --> 00:58:13,152
They said they can do the upgrade you requested.

862
00:58:14,522 --> 00:58:15,783
It's already done?

863
00:58:15,852 --> 00:58:18,393
Yes. The legal team...

864
00:58:18,393 --> 00:58:20,163
provided their opinion on the design patent.

865
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:22,163
And the marketing team prepared...

866
00:58:22,163 --> 00:58:24,292
the press releases regarding plagiarism issue.

867
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,502
And this is the plan for managing the extra budget.

868
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:30,232
Things got done faster than I imagined.

869
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:33,402
They still can't catch up with you.

870
00:58:45,783 --> 00:58:47,252
Will I be able to find another secretary...

871
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:49,852
like you, Ms. Kim?

872
00:58:54,723 --> 00:58:57,292
The better you perform, the more I hate to see you go.

873
00:58:58,192 --> 00:58:59,462
But it lets me realize this.

874
00:59:00,732 --> 00:59:03,573
I've been so comfortable because of you.

875
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:09,973
Thank you...

876
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,172
for working with me until now.

877
00:59:24,593 --> 00:59:25,922
Here's your pizza.

878
00:59:26,323 --> 00:59:27,462
Have some pizza.

879
00:59:27,593 --> 00:59:30,493
- It's here. - I looks delicious.

880
00:59:32,763 --> 00:59:33,902
I am so hungry.

881
00:59:34,163 --> 00:59:36,902
- It looks so good. - Thank you.

882
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:39,203
Have some, Mr. Yang.

883
00:59:39,473 --> 00:59:40,573
It's so good.

884
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,203
Are you eating dinner only now?

885
00:59:42,502 --> 00:59:45,513
Yes. We are eating dinner after finishing our work.

886
00:59:46,372 --> 00:59:48,212
You did a great job today.

887
00:59:48,442 --> 00:59:50,613
It was an unexpected situation, but you handled it well.

888
00:59:51,783 --> 00:59:53,413
You did everything.

889
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:56,453
Those who say you are so proud of your looks...

890
00:59:56,622 --> 00:59:59,323
and that you flirted with Mr. Lee...

891
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:01,363
should've seen you work today.

892
01:00:01,462 --> 01:00:04,863
They need to know that you got this far by your merit alone.

893
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:08,033
Come on. Why would you say that now?

894
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:12,902
It's all right. I've already heard it, and it's not true.

895
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,703
She's generous too.

896
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:19,172
By the way, we are in trouble.

897
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:22,413
What would we do without you?

898
01:00:27,783 --> 01:00:31,053
Mr. Lee. Have this when it's warm. It's delicious.

899
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:33,493
No. This is much better with sauce.

900
01:00:34,993 --> 01:00:37,493
No. You have to eat more.

901
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:40,433
I'm all right.

902
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:43,703
You worked hard today. You should eat them all.

903
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:46,633
- I will use the restroom. - Okay.

904
01:01:15,433 --> 01:01:16,732
(Kim Smile! Let's smile.)

905
01:01:16,732 --> 01:01:18,232
(Keep your head cool. Keep your heart warm. Put your feet on fire.)

906
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:33,683
(Abroad business trip record)

907
01:02:04,752 --> 01:02:06,852
Ms. Kim, should we go home together?

908
01:02:07,082 --> 01:02:08,223
I will drop you off at yours.

909
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:23,033
You did a great job today.

910
01:02:23,502 --> 01:02:24,832
Go in and have a good rest.

911
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:27,902
Mr. Lee.

912
01:02:31,243 --> 01:02:33,172
I have something to tell you.

913
01:02:34,582 --> 01:02:35,613
Okay.

914
01:02:39,113 --> 01:02:40,152
I..

915
01:02:41,922 --> 01:02:43,622
I won't quit my job.

916
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:51,562
What do you mean?

917
01:02:53,192 --> 01:02:54,663
It's just as it sounds.

918
01:02:55,633 --> 01:02:58,772
I want to stay beside you as your secretary.

919
01:03:03,272 --> 01:03:04,372
Is it...

920
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:08,013
because of the problems that broke out today?

921
01:03:09,482 --> 01:03:10,982
You don't have to worry about the company.

922
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,849
- Mr. Lee. - As you must already know,

923
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:16,544
I even have great adaptability.

924
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:20,422
I will feel your absence for a while.

925
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:22,893
But I will get used to it soon.

926
01:03:23,163 --> 01:03:26,093
So go find what you want to do.

927
01:03:28,562 --> 01:03:29,633
I found it.

928
01:03:32,633 --> 01:03:36,743
I think staying as your secretary is what I want to do.

929
01:03:41,343 --> 01:03:42,513
Perhaps...

930
01:03:43,343 --> 01:03:47,352
I've been doing the job which I am good at and is perfect for me.

931
01:03:48,582 --> 01:03:51,152
Because I've gotten too used to it, I didn't realize it.

932
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,863
I like assisting someone...

933
01:03:56,323 --> 01:03:58,133
and solving problems that break out.

934
01:03:58,863 --> 01:04:01,533
I like the sense of achievement I feel after all the works done.

935
01:04:03,772 --> 01:04:04,832
Ms. Kim.

936
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:07,872
And...

937
01:04:09,973 --> 01:04:12,573
I don't want the person I love to be in trouble.

938
01:04:18,712 --> 01:04:22,122
Honestly, who else would be able to handle you?

939
01:04:29,922 --> 01:04:32,893
You tried to let me go because you love me.

940
01:04:35,332 --> 01:04:37,372
But because I love you,

941
01:04:38,803 --> 01:04:40,442
I want to stay beside you.

942
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:55,522
You didn't even get to have dinner.

943
01:04:56,252 --> 01:04:57,522
Should I stay for some ramen?

944
01:04:59,223 --> 01:05:00,292
That would be great.

945
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:12,633
I think I ran out of ramen.

946
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:18,343
I have one right here.

947
01:05:18,343 --> 01:05:19,942
I think if I put in frozen dumplings,

948
01:05:19,942 --> 01:05:22,383
it will be enough for the two of us.

949
01:05:23,413 --> 01:05:24,513
Dumplings?

950
01:05:24,513 --> 01:05:26,252
If you put in rice cakes here, it becomes rice cake ramen.

951
01:05:26,252 --> 01:05:27,652
If you put in cheese, it becomes cheese ramen.

952
01:05:28,622 --> 01:05:29,883
It's the master of transformation.

953
01:05:29,883 --> 01:05:32,053
It's the great instant food with additives.

954
01:05:37,962 --> 01:05:39,832
Why am I so happy right now?

955
01:05:41,102 --> 01:05:43,133
Actually, this was what I have been dreaming of.

956
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:46,473
Cooking with my husband after work...

957
01:05:46,473 --> 01:05:47,772
and spending the evening together.

958
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:57,312
Why is the house so hot?

959
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:04,823
I will make your dream...

960
01:06:05,593 --> 01:06:06,792
come true.

961
01:06:09,223 --> 01:06:10,962
We will always come home together,

962
01:06:11,462 --> 01:06:13,033
and we will always eat ramen together.

963
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,273
It's fine even if my body gets filled with MSG.

964
01:06:24,172 --> 01:06:25,212
I...

965
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,212
I want to be your husband.

966
01:06:32,282 --> 01:06:33,983
I want to marry you, Kim Mi So.

967
01:06:39,553 --> 01:06:41,462
Why? Do you have any objections?

968
01:06:54,603 --> 01:06:56,813
- Objection! - Dad!

969
01:06:59,813 --> 01:07:02,712
- Father! - I raise objections...

970
01:07:03,013 --> 01:07:05,912
to this marriage.
