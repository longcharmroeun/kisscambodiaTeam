1
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,096
Lee Young Joon...

2
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,236
is the Vice Chairman of Yumyung Group.

3
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:51,077
Since he was made the Vice Chairman, the company doubled the gain.

4
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:53,736
And that made him the most competent young CEO in the nation.

5
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:57,206
He's got the body, face, and the suit fit.

6
00:00:58,116 --> 00:00:59,116
He's got everything.

7
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,846
I heard the rumor that he keeps women away from him.

8
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:02,887
Right.

9
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,517
That's not true. Actually,

10
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:07,726
I am going out with him right now.

11
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:10,426
But he does keep me away from him.

12
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,467
- Young Joon! - Mr. Lee!

13
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:38,786
What's wrong with her?

14
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,616
What?

15
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:45,756
What's wrong with Secretary Kim?

16
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,197
(What's Wrong With Secretary Kim)

17
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:52,137
(Episode 1)

18
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:43,746
Today, I got you a monotone tie...

19
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,556
which will make you look intelligent and modern.

20
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:49,727
- Very good. - Thank you.

21
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:01,336
Isn't it dazzling?

22
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:04,167
- Do you mean the sunshine? - No.

23
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:07,746
The aura...

24
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,477
I exude.

25
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:17,347
Yes, it is dazzling.

26
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,156
Here is your schedule for the day.

27
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:26,297
(Executive Director Kim Jung Jae)

28
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:29,297
It's Mr. Kim. Should I answer it?

29
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:32,667
No. He's going to tell me that the Vietnam business didn't go well.

30
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:35,306
I don't want this guilty man to ruin my morning mood.

31
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,607
What do you mean by "this guilty man"?

32
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:37,637
Hurting someone or stealing something...

33
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:39,436
isn't the only things that make you guilty.

34
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:42,977
Incompetence and being unaware of your incompetence...

35
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,246
make you guilty too.

36
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:46,877
- Do you know, Ms. Kim? - Excuse me?

37
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:49,716
How can a man be so incompetent?

38
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:53,216
- I wonder too. - You simply do it and win it.

39
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,757
Why on earth can't people do such a simple thing?

40
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:59,456
Not everyone is like you, sir.

41
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:03,466
- Is that right? - Of course.

42
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,036
In my entire life,

43
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,836
I have never seen another man as perfect as you, sir.

44
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:12,307
Who is it?

45
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:15,976
This time, it's a call from an absolute sinner.

46
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:17,307
What should I do, sir?

47
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:29,187
We've arrived.

48
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:06,327
Mr. Lee, you are mistaken. There's been a misunderstanding.

49
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,927
How can you be at the red-light district during the office hour?

50
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:13,096
- I'm sorry, sir. - You're a senior managing director.

51
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:14,307
Why don't you think about the company's image?

52
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:16,937
I am sorry. I will make sure this doesn't happen again.

53
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,007
- Ms. Kim. - Yes, sir.

54
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:20,947
- What's next? - You have a board meeting...

55
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:22,807
about the new business.

56
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,046
You know you're not allowed to smoke inside.

57
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:34,956
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee.

58
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,057
Mr. Lee.

59
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:39,656
Mr. Lee.

60
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:46,367
Mr. Jo, don't be too disheartened.

61
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,836
Your project failed, and you got found at the red-light district.

62
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,336
Because Mr. Lee had high hopes for you, he's very disappointed.

63
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:53,106
That's why he's very upset.

64
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,507
You see, Mr. Lee tried very hard to cover up our company name...

65
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:57,677
from that article about you.

66
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:01,146
Ms. Kim, why did I do that?

67
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:03,646
I must've been possessed.

68
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:07,387
Don't forget about this moment, and just live harder.

69
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:10,286
Mr. Jo, why don't you go home early today...

70
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,796
and take some rest?

71
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,296
Should I do that?

72
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:16,267
Okay then.

73
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,796
I will be more careful starting tomorrow.

74
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:23,867
Ms. Im.

75
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:25,776
I'm going home first.

76
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:30,677
Mr. Jo...

77
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:33,817
can keep working here, right?

78
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:41,427
Please clear Mr. Jo's desk and all other furniture now.

79
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,427
Have you seen Mr. Lee giving someone a second chance?

80
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:51,367
We will take over the international airline ranked third in the country.

81
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,237
Within five years, we will grow it into the airline the best...

82
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:56,137
in the domestic market and within the best 10 in the global market.

83
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,437
As soon as the decision is made,

84
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:00,877
we will actively start taking orders from USA, India, and Vietnam...

85
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:04,846
in order to expedite the aviation business.

86
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,117
If you will look at the financial statement,

87
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,586
you will see that the current asset is 2.024 billion dollars.

88
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:12,887
And the current liabilities are 940 million dollars.

89
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:15,086
The current ratio...

90
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:18,226
is about 275 percent.

91
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:22,166
It's 215.319149.

92
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:27,396
- Sir? - If the current asset...

93
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,437
is 2.024 billion, and the current liabilities are 940 million,

94
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:32,807
shouldn't the current ratio be 215.319149?

95
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:34,077
Mr. Park?

96
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:38,877
Well, you're right.

97
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:40,677
Why do the numbers...

98
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,247
Proceed with the acquisition.

99
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:45,757
Let's end the meeting here.

100
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:57,836
Gosh, that was intense.

101
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,836
Isn't he too intense?

102
00:08:00,036 --> 00:08:01,807
My life is going to get shortened.

103
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,406
He scares me to death.

104
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,406
Mr. Lee.

105
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:11,046
- It's not him. - Seriously?

106
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,817
I agree with you.

107
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,546
Gosh, that surprised me.

108
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:18,186
He doesn't want us to badmouth his friend, does he?

109
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:22,026
He's been invited to a private party...

110
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:24,396
at the Spanish ambassador's party.

111
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:26,926
So would it be okay if I call you back tomorrow?

112
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:28,127
To reschedule?

113
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:40,877
- It's gotten much better. - Sir?

114
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:42,176
Your English.

115
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:45,416
Nine years ago, when we first went to the US,

116
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,347
you struggled to communicate in English.

117
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:50,387
Right. You made it happen.

118
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,916
Right. My unsparing support...

119
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,556
must've helped you a lot.

120
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:57,426
More than that, I improved because you embarrassed me...

121
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:58,757
every time I made a mistake with the accent,

122
00:08:58,757 --> 00:09:00,296
and you didn't hesitate to scold me.

123
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:01,826
It really pushed me to work harder.

124
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,666
Embarrassment and scolding.

125
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:07,196
Okay. If it helps you grow,

126
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:08,566
I will continue to give that to you.

127
00:09:09,436 --> 00:09:11,076
- Much appreciated, sir. - By the way,

128
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,507
you just made another mistake.

129
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:16,446
- Sir? - It's not "accent".

130
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:18,517
It's "accent".

131
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,446
I learned another thing.

132
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:30,587
I am sorry, sir. I had to skip a meal to wear a dress.

133
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,597
Because of the meeting, I didn't get to prepare you snacks.

134
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:35,666
Are you all right, sir?

135
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,796
I am fine.

136
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:39,436
You know how focused I get.

137
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,607
When I am working, I don't even feel hungry.

138
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:48,747
I will prepare the snacks.

139
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:08,696
He's the newly appointed Spanish ambassador.

140
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,166
Hello.

141
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,367
Congratulations on your new post.

142
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:16,436
I heard a lot about you in Spain, Mr. Lee.

143
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:17,467
It's nice to meet you.

144
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:19,337
And you.

145
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:28,416
For the past four years, Yumyung Group has been...

146
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,487
ranked first as the company with the best corporate image.

147
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:34,387
The bio business has recently been approved by the US FDA.

148
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:37,227
We succeeded to create surplus.

149
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:40,627
We want to cooperate with China. You have a great network of people.

150
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:43,196
We are planning various businesses.

151
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,707
He's so amazing. Don't you think so?

152
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:53,137
- He's so gorgeous. - I told you so.

153
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:54,776
Look at him.

154
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:58,217
- He looks so elegant. - Our eyes met.

155
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:00,017
One second, please.

156
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:03,446
- He's coming over here. - No way.

157
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:04,686
- Is he coming to me? - I'd love that.

158
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:13,056
What? Did he just pass by me?

159
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:14,926
- He passed by me. - He's looking at a mirror.

160
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,597
- I can't believe this. - This is so annoying.

161
00:11:18,597 --> 00:11:20,097
The ambassador is waiting.

162
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:22,967
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

163
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:24,936
How do I look right now?

164
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:28,247
You look perfect.

165
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,877
Let's go.

166
00:11:46,426 --> 00:11:47,867
When did you learn Spanish?

167
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:50,166
Spanish?

168
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,196
You were talking for quite a long time...

169
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:54,036
with those Spanish guys hitting on you.

170
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,436
Oh, that.

171
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,676
Thanks to you, I barely managed to learn English and Chinese.

172
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,337
I didn't have time to learn Spanish.

173
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:01,546
I was just guessing the whole time.

174
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:03,576
- Guessing? - Yes.

175
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,276
When they look at you while handing you champagne,

176
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:08,117
it must mean, "Excuse us."

177
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:12,117
What they were saying while looking at you must've been compliments.

178
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:14,156
So I just smiled and nodded.

179
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:15,186
Right.

180
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:16,926
And when a guy tries to make a move,

181
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:19,196
I touch my earring with my left hand.

182
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,467
Why is it your left hand?

183
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,837
When I show them my ring, everything gets sorted out.

184
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:29,066
This is the ring I won on last sports day.

185
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:32,076
You are amazing.

186
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:36,546
I can't believe I am getting praised by you.

187
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:38,316
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

188
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:41,587
Anyway, well done today. Tell me whatever you want.

189
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:43,816
You need to be properly compensated for your achievement.

190
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:45,286
Sir.

191
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,217
I refuse to take no as an answer.

192
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:49,457
That's not it. I have something to tell you.

193
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:51,857
Don't confess your love. Our relationship is strictly business.

194
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:54,867
I don't plan to.

195
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:56,867
What is it that you want to say?

196
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:01,436
I think you need to find a new secretary.

197
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,737
I am going to resign now.

198
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,956
I think you need to find a new secretary.

199
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,367
I am going to resign now.

200
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:27,076
Why so suddenly?

201
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,647
It's for a personal reason.

202
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,816
All right. If you want to do so.

203
00:13:56,206 --> 00:13:57,676
Why can't I fall asleep?

204
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,196
My gosh, what's the fuss now?

205
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:19,267
Well, I just heard amazing news.

206
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,497
What is this "amazing news"?

207
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:22,867
I am sure it's a false rumor.

208
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:25,637
Darling, it's real this time.

209
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,436
Only those who can take it should gather around.

210
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,446
- Hurry up. - I can't take it.

211
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,086
You know, Ms. Kim...

212
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:42,857
- What about Ms. Kim? - Ms. Kim...

213
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:45,056
is resigning.

214
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,296
What is this?

215
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:54,897
Do you not believe me?

216
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:56,497
Of course we don't believe you.

217
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,566
Why would she resign?

218
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,607
Mr. Lee really cherishes her.

219
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,676
Why would she quit? That's nonsense.

220
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,206
It makes sense.

221
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,647
I am really quitting.

222
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:08,517
Really?

223
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,917
Are you really quitting?

224
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,216
Yes. It turned out like that.

225
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,586
See? I was right.

226
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,716
But isn't it too sudden?

227
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:17,417
Why? Are you getting married?

228
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:19,326
Are you getting another job? Or are you going abroad to study?

229
00:15:20,757 --> 00:15:21,826
None of that.

230
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:24,926
Then is it because of Mr. Lee's bad behavior?

231
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,426
- It's not that either. - Then why?

232
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:30,336
It's just a personal reason.

233
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,537
Mr. Lee is coming.

234
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,176
Hello, sir.

235
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,017
Ms. Lee.

236
00:15:51,387 --> 00:15:53,757
I can't imagine you...

237
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:55,426
not being next to Mr. Lee. Don't you think so too?

238
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,056
It doesn't feel real to me yet either.

239
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,027
- I feel so sad. - I know.

240
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:04,397
So you just have to prepare snacks around this time?

241
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,167
You make Darjeeling tea by using this teapot.

242
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:09,076
You serve him cookies from H Hotel. Three pieces.

243
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:10,976
Right.

244
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:12,907
Why would you be in charge of that, Ms. Bong?

245
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:14,147
Why do you think so?

246
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,976
When Ms. Kim is gone, it will be my duty.

247
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:19,316
- Why? - If you look at her,

248
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:22,157
it's obvious that Mr. Lee cares about his secretary's looks.

249
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:23,257
When Ms. Kim resigns,

250
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,627
who would be in her position? I'm the only alternative.

251
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,397
At times like this, I really get jealous of you, Ms. Lee.

252
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,897
I wish I looked as ordinary as you.

253
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:38,466
Well, Mr. Lee comes into the office at 7am, so I must be here by half 6.

254
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:40,436
I can't sleep much then. What do I do?

255
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:43,806
What do I do?

256
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:50,377
- Hello. - Hello.

257
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,637
You're thinking about changing the swivel chair, aren't you?

258
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,776
You are amazing.

259
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,736
I know what goes on inside your head too.

260
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:22,676
You don't mean it, do you?

261
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:24,077
You really don't mean to resign.

262
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,286
You are wrong this time.

263
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,456
What is the reason?

264
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:33,026
Is it because I've been making you work late hours and on weekends?

265
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,097
I will post a job advertisement within this morning.

266
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,797
We will try our best to sort out the best candidates.

267
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:39,266
You only need to interview the final candidates.

268
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:43,567
As you wish.

269
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:57,946
(Qualifications for Applying for the Job)

270
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:02,387
That's finished.

271
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,426
Oh, Mr. Lee. Did you need something?

272
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:11,297
I'm going to Mr. Park's office.

273
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,597
Push my conference call back to the afternoon.

274
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,466
I'm going to eat at home,

275
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:17,867
so take care of your lunch on your own.

276
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,407
Yes, sir.

277
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:24,077
Ms. Kim! Ms. Kim!

278
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,347
You haven't had lunch yet, right? Let's have lunch together!

279
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:29,847
I'm sorry but I have to head out to take care of some personal matters.

280
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:30,917
Without even eating?

281
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:33,417
- Eat just a little bit. - Next time. Sorry!

282
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,756
What's her problem?

283
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,327
And here I was, trying to eat with her and take over her role.

284
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:45,897
I'm a busy person too, you know.

285
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,407
Seriously.

286
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:55,637
What could her reason be?

287
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,436
For do you mean?

288
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,877
The real reason why she wants to quit all of the sudden.

289
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,877
Oh, you mean Ms. Mi So?

290
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,547
There was nothing I couldn't figure out about her before,

291
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:05,887
but I really can't figure this one out.

292
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:08,417
This is so frustrating that I'm feeling dizzy.

293
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:10,387
Really?

294
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,097
Let's see here.

295
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:24,236
Here we go.

296
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:28,506
Red ginseng is the best for when your blood sugar is low!

297
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:30,536
Want some?

298
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:36,216
Are you seriously telling me to eat some sugar-filled thing...

299
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,887
that only has 0.03 percent of pure red ginseng in it?

300
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:40,446
No thanks. Just tell me...

301
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,456
why Ms. Kim is doing this.

302
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,256
You really don't know?

303
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,426
It's remarkable enough...

304
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:49,226
that she was able to handle working for you for nine years.

305
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:51,167
They call such a woman a "bodhisattva" in the East,

306
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,966
and a "celestial angel" in the West...

307
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:57,466
What did I just say?

308
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,706
Two years. Two...

309
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:02,236
Two... I mean, nine years.

310
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:03,936
It's about time.

311
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:07,077
They say that there is something called "the 3, 6, 9 Rule."

312
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,317
"The 3, 6, 9 Rule?"

313
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,986
Until the burnout sets in.

314
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,456
You know how my wife and I were each others' soulmates...

315
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:17,557
when we were a month deep into our relationship...

316
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:19,756
and I loved her enough to marry her back then?

317
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,756
Of course. And I'm even more well aware of the fact...

318
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:22,857
that you two exchanged divorce papers...

319
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:24,226
instead of gifts on your 10th wedding anniversary.

320
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:26,597
Oh, you're so rude.

321
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,397
At the beginning, the two of us were...

322
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:31,907
burning with love for one another!

323
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:33,936
But...

324
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:36,176
the thing she said on our third wedding anniversary was...

325
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:39,446
I love you.

326
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,347
Why did ever fall in love with a man like you?

327
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:44,887
And on our sixth wedding anniversary...

328
00:20:46,117 --> 00:20:47,516
Excuse me, Waiter?

329
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:51,986
Sorry, but I just want to smack you when I see the back of your head.

330
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:56,097
And on our ninth wedding anniversary...

331
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:58,627
You're wasting air,

332
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:03,097
so don't even breathe, you jerk!

333
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,077
You're not...

334
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,746
crying right now, are you?

335
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,387
- Is it okay if I cry? - No.

336
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:27,357
Looking back now,

337
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:29,526
I think that the burnout settled in...

338
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,097
during the 3rd, 6th, and 9th years.

339
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:34,867
It's kind of like a bruised apple.

340
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,706
"A bruised apple"?

341
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,006
Yes, look here.

342
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:44,307
All you have to do is to cut the rotten part away and eat it.

343
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:45,347
But you can't be bothered to.

344
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:48,776
That's why you eat a fruit that is in much better condition instead.

345
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:52,716
But what would happen when this bruised apple...

346
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:53,716
is among other apples?

347
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,186
Then the other apples become bruised too!

348
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:01,696
Eventually, they all become bruised and rot!

349
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,726
What are you getting at?

350
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,766
Before things rot even more,

351
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,936
you must speak with her to make a breakthrough with her.

352
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:14,036
A breakthrough?

353
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:19,176
That's easy enough.

354
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:22,347
Let me know if you need help making that breakthrough.

355
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:24,216
You got a divorce because you couldn't.

356
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:25,216
That's true.

357
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:29,216
Seriously.

358
00:22:57,317 --> 00:22:58,417
Here's my loan payment.

359
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:00,087
- That's the last of it, right? - Yes.

360
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:05,226
So your name is Secretary Lee?

361
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:07,686
No, no.

362
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:09,956
My name is Kim Mi So.

363
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:13,466
(Kim Mi So)

364
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,736
- Here you are. - Thank you.

365
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:21,476
Yes, Mr. Lee?

366
00:23:22,577 --> 00:23:23,676
Right now?

367
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:25,676
You want me there too?

368
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,667
- We'll be heading to his home. - Understood.

369
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:11,986
You gave me the impression that you were heading home alone.

370
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:13,226
Why do you want me to come all of the sudden?

371
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:15,797
A breakthrough?

372
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:17,696
Pardon?

373
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:36,516
I'm not someone who gives second chances.

374
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,887
- Yes, I know. - But for you,

375
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:40,317
I will make a special exception and give you...

376
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:41,456
- one more chance. - Pardon?

377
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:43,516
You won't ever get another chance, so be grateful.

378
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,926
I'll promote you to a director.

379
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:46,857
- That's not... - If it's too much work,

380
00:24:46,857 --> 00:24:48,797
I'll hire someone else to support you...

381
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:50,157
and a car will be provided for you by the company as well.

382
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,897
And if you want, I can even have the company pay for your accommodations.

383
00:24:52,897 --> 00:24:54,297
Have your family's debts all been paid off?

384
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:56,536
I'll take care of all that for you too.

385
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,706
Well, then let's work hard together from now on.

386
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,476
- Excuse me, Mr. Lee? - I guarantee you.

387
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:03,637
You won't get such an offer from anywhere else.

388
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:04,847
Furthermore,

389
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:09,676
you won't be able to find a boss that is as perfect as myself.

390
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,986
I won't judge you even if you immediately accept my offer,

391
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:14,246
so just accept it, and continue working for me.

392
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,216
- Well, sir... - Young Joon!

393
00:25:16,357 --> 00:25:18,087
Oh, Ms. Kim! You're here too?

394
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:23,297
My dear sweetheart.

395
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:26,367
- Let us go inside. - Yes, let's go.

396
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,476
I told you to come by more often.

397
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:43,147
It's so hard for me to see you even if we work in the same building.

398
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:44,847
I've been busy due to matters involving Mr. Jo.

399
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:48,117
It's such a shame to lose him. Do you really have to...

400
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:50,117
It only takes a single moment to ruin our company's image.

401
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,726
Since you've entrusted me with the matter, I will take care of it.

402
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:55,327
That's right. You're doing a fabulous job, Young Joon.

403
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:56,426
Come on.

404
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:59,067
It's as if you don't want him to handle difficult matters on his own!

405
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:04,837
You're right. I was being inconsiderate.

406
00:26:06,137 --> 00:26:07,637
My deepest apologies.

407
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:13,347
Have you two ever experienced...

408
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:15,147
burnout during your marriage?

409
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:18,917
"Burnout"?

410
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:23,357
There's no such thing.

411
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:26,327
There's nothing that good conversations can't resolve.

412
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:28,897
Neither of us have felt that before.

413
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:39,407
All right. Let's eat, okay?

414
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,107
- Eat up, Ms. Kim. - Yes, ma'am.

415
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:47,206
Doesn't it seem like our Young Joon has gotten a bit taller lately?

416
00:26:48,347 --> 00:26:51,047
You're far too kind. I am merely your handiwork.

417
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:52,887
This is the reason why I respect you so.

418
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:08,597
Our current bio project has received the US FDA's approval,

419
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:10,567
and we are currently in the middle of acquiring a global airline.

420
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:15,276
Father?

421
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:20,107
It seems like there is something you wish to speak to me about...

422
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:22,147
since you are awkwardly forcing yourself to cough.

423
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:25,847
- Do you plan to not get married? - Yes.

424
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:31,986
My goodness. Oh, my goodness. This is killing me!

425
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:34,226
- Are you all right? - Do I look like I'm all right?

426
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:39,367
I don't think I have much time left for me.

427
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,167
I saw the results of your annual checkup.

428
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:43,597
You're completely healthy.

429
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:45,206
Those hacks don't know anything!

430
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,766
I know my body better than anyone else!

431
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:50,276
Your old father has just one wish before he dies.

432
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:53,107
And that's to have grandchildren before I die!

433
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:01,617
I won't even say what my future daughter-in-law would need.

434
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:05,786
I heard Secretary Kim wants to resign!

435
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:10,397
That's never going to happen. I won't let that happen.

436
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:22,107
The weather...

437
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:25,607
is great today.

438
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:33,986
It's about Young Joon.

439
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:38,157
I hear he takes girls to gatherings here and there.

440
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:40,256
But his relationships don't last long.

441
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:43,797
It seems like he can't date them seriously either.

442
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:46,926
They say it's only to show others.

443
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:48,966
Is that true?

444
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:51,607
Yes.

445
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:54,936
They say he doesn't let girls even touch him.

446
00:28:56,006 --> 00:28:57,176
Is that really true?

447
00:28:58,607 --> 00:28:59,647
Yes.

448
00:29:00,547 --> 00:29:01,647
Then...

449
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:04,077
is my son...

450
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:06,446
really...

451
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:09,157
Is he really...

452
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:11,186
Really...

453
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:14,026
Is he...

454
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:17,226
Is he...

455
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:20,897
- Is he... - You mean, gay?

456
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:24,867
No, he isn't.

457
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:26,337
Really?

458
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:28,907
Of course, I've worked for him for a long time,

459
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:30,377
so I know about him better than anyone else.

460
00:29:32,577 --> 00:29:33,907
Thank goodness.

461
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,577
The chairman and I haven't spoke of it,

462
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:39,347
but we were really worried about him.

463
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,686
Young Joon keeps himself away from girls...

464
00:29:42,686 --> 00:29:45,157
other than you, so we've wondered...

465
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:47,756
- if the rumors were true. - I see.

466
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:51,327
Look. I want to ask you something about him.

467
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:54,097
How is he in girls' eyes?

468
00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:56,667
He's the best.

469
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:58,766
He's competent, charming, and nice.

470
00:30:01,337 --> 00:30:04,107
He's faultless and perfect.

471
00:30:04,107 --> 00:30:07,377
Right? You do have a good eye for people.

472
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:11,486
It'd be great...

473
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:15,016
if someone shows up to be his girlfriend.

474
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,887
For example, someone like you.

475
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:23,726
I'm joking.

476
00:30:29,236 --> 00:30:32,436
I'll marry him off right away if there's a woman like you.

477
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:36,536
I'm joking.

478
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:40,907
Let's go, Secretary Kim.

479
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:42,547
Yes, sir.

480
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:44,746
Please excuse me, ma'am.

481
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:50,857
Did my mother make you feel uncomfortable?

482
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:52,956
Well, yes.

483
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,597
She seemed to want to make things between you and me.

484
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:58,327
So?

485
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,067
Did you get excited?

486
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:05,137
No, I was made sure that I must resign as soon as possible...

487
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:06,536
before I get involved in this anymore.

488
00:31:06,536 --> 00:31:07,567
What?

489
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:11,246
I thought we settled that matter earlier.

490
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,907
You know well that it's a shocking condition.

491
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,746
Yes, I do know you've offered a shocking condition,

492
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,746
but I still want to resign.

493
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:23,157
I'm sorry. I can't take it back.

494
00:31:29,926 --> 00:31:31,766
Don't make me go competitive on this.

495
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,790

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

496
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:47,917
I told you I'd do it.

497
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,276
It's my work habit.

498
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:51,917
I feel obsessed to set the table myself.

499
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:54,456
Mi So, let's eat together.

500
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:56,387
Both of you should enjoy the food.

501
00:31:58,557 --> 00:32:00,986
By the way, you two look haggard.

502
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,357
Is it tough to work at the hospital?

503
00:32:03,726 --> 00:32:06,667
Mi So, don't worry about our business anymore.

504
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,337
I didn't take care of my younger siblings as the eldest...

505
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:12,966
and looked only for myself. You struggled a lot because of that.

506
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,276
Don't say that.

507
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:18,377
You two joined me on the way, so we paid the debt back together.

508
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:21,746
Plus, you didn't cause any trouble like our dad.

509
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:24,716
What? Dad caused trouble again?

510
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:29,117
Well, Dad borrowed money from a loan shark earlier this month.

511
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:32,357
It was about 30,000 dollars.

512
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:35,256
- 30,000 dollars? - Why are you bringing that up now?

513
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:37,157
It would've only made you worry.

514
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:38,526
So what happened?

515
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:40,097
I sold my car to pay it off.

516
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:41,466
Did you have a car?

517
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,466
I missed a bus and got late about 10 minutes,

518
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:47,807
and the vice chairman bought it for me.

519
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:50,276
I sold it after driving it for only about a week.

520
00:32:54,476 --> 00:32:57,276
I paid off all the debt, so I feel so relaxed now.

521
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:15,097
Your laughing face is very irritating.

522
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:17,837
But it's funny.

523
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,307
What is so funny?

524
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:25,307
Now that I think about it again, it's not so funny.

525
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:29,317
After all those times we shared together,

526
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:31,387
how could she be this calm?

527
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:34,917
You always said you two were only work-related.

528
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:36,756
I wonder what the reason is.

529
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:40,186
Mi So must not have done it for a shocking condition.

530
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:41,996
Think carefully.

531
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:45,297
She must've had some kind of trigger that made her want to resign.

532
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,996
"Trigger"?

533
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:52,167
The aura I exude.

534
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:54,476
"Accent".

535
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:56,976
I want to resign.

536
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:58,507
Young Joon.

537
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:01,476
Oh Ji Ran?

538
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,016
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

539
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:08,217
I told you not to forget about taking your allergy pills.

540
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:11,487
Why are you the only one among us who's allergic to pollen?

541
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:15,397
Thank you.

542
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:18,197
I supported you for a reason after all.

543
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,496
We're so sorry for what you've done for us.

544
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:30,737
I'm sorry, but the meat was starting to burn.

545
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:39,947
Why did you touch flowers when you're allergic to pollen?

546
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:41,717
Did your vice chairman make you do it again?

547
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:47,956
Young Joon.

548
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:54,366
What brings you here?

549
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:56,737
I was invited as a celebrity.

550
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:59,167
I checked the invitation list and found your name,

551
00:34:59,337 --> 00:35:02,837
so I came here in secret to surprise you.

552
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:06,476
You should've called me instead.

553
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:08,547
Did you come with her because you thought I was busy?

554
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:13,487
But don't you notice something different with me?

555
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:25,167
Your necklace looks good on you.

556
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:28,266
It's what you gave me as a gift.

557
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:31,837
Oh, right.

558
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:35,177
What day do you think today is?

559
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:40,647
Come on. It's my birthday.

560
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:44,647
Giving me some flowers...

561
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,886
is good enough for my birthday gift.

562
00:35:58,726 --> 00:35:59,866
Welcome.

563
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,266
- Give me flowers. - What kind of flowers?

564
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:04,266
Just a bunch of flowers. A big bouquet of flowers.

565
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:25,456
Thank you so much. You're the best indeed.

566
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:30,326
They're beautiful.

567
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:36,897
Secretary Kim cried?

568
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:39,237
I thought I was mistaken at that time.

569
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:42,936
But her eyes were teary.

570
00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:45,076
Her eyes were full of moisture.

571
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,846
"Do I have to..."

572
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:50,777
"prepare flowers even for other girls?"

573
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:53,746
"I can't stand this anymore. I quit."

574
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:55,257
Is it this kind of situation?

575
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:57,456
No, that isn't right.

576
00:36:58,656 --> 00:37:01,156
I think I finally know why she wants to resign.

577
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:04,056
Why do I have a bad feeling about your guess?

578
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:07,936
Why didn't I realize this earlier?

579
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:12,906
I'm such a fool.

580
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:15,406
Right, you fool.

581
00:37:16,177 --> 00:37:17,237
What is it?

582
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:20,877
Her personal reason which can't be spoken.

583
00:37:20,877 --> 00:37:22,076
Her eyes.

584
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:26,846
- Secretary Kim... - Okay.

585
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:28,686
Secretary Kim...

586
00:37:32,757 --> 00:37:33,927
likes me.

587
00:37:38,366 --> 00:37:39,996
Like me, my foot.

588
00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:42,967
Why?

589
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:45,567
He buys you clothes, shoes, and so much other stuff.

590
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:47,806
I know it's to keep your image,

591
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:49,337
- but isn't it too much? - I know, right?

592
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:51,947
I'm sure the vice chairman likes you.

593
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,447
That's never the case.

594
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:57,947
He loves himself so much that he doesn't care about others.

595
00:37:57,947 --> 00:38:00,286
He's never fallen in love...

596
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:01,616
with other people.

597
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:04,217
- That doesn't make sense. - I'm serious.

598
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:06,656
He's never loved anyone at that age?

599
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:08,556
There is Mi So.

600
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:10,956
- Must you say that? - That hurts.

601
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:19,067
- Do you want some? - No, thanks.

602
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:25,206
I was careful just in case she had feelings for me.

603
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,677
How considerate.

604
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:33,417
Then again, she worked by my side for nine years,

605
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:35,217
so she'd be a robot if she had no feelings for me.

606
00:38:35,217 --> 00:38:37,516
Well, let's not be too sure about that.

607
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:39,956
Goodness, Secretary Kim.

608
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:41,956
We're supposed to be work-related.

609
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,226
I knew it.

610
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:46,927
She likes me just like I expected.

611
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,206
Okay.

612
00:38:56,277 --> 00:38:58,206
There's nothing between us.

613
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:00,406
There's no romance between the vice chairman and me.

614
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:01,846
We're only work-related.

615
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:05,686
And I'm resigning from work.

616
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:08,616
- You're resigning? - Why all of a sudden?

617
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,456
Did he bully you again?

618
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:11,826
Why that jerk...

619
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:13,386
That's not it.

620
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,326
Dad and you two have settled down.

621
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:18,897
We've paid off the debt too.

622
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:20,397
So I want to resign.

623
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,996
What will you do after that?

624
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:23,797
I'm not sure yet.

625
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:25,536
It feels bad...

626
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:28,406
because I won't be treated this good at my age with my career.

627
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:30,076
But it keeps me so busy,

628
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,007
and I don't think I'll be able to resign forever if it's not now.

629
00:39:33,147 --> 00:39:34,206
Plus...

630
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:37,116
(Vice Chairman Lee)

631
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:42,317
(Vice Chairman Lee)

632
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:44,656
Is it the vice chairman?

633
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:46,726
- Don't take it. - Don't.

634
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:48,397
- Come on. - Don't.

635
00:39:48,397 --> 00:39:49,496
Don't take it.

636
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:50,656
Seriously.

637
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:52,996
Yes, sir.

638
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:54,636
You know where I am, right?

639
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:55,936
Come here right now.

640
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:58,936
Sir, I'm attending my business at the moment,

641
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:00,706
so can you ask Mr. Yang...

642
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,306
Or I'll call a designated driver for you.

643
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:03,777
How can I trust them?

644
00:40:04,476 --> 00:40:05,647
He wants you to be there now?

645
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:07,746
- Let me talk to him. - Hey, don't.

646
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:09,417
Why don't you call Ji Ran then?

647
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,817
- Sleep with her just for today. - Come here right now.

648
00:40:13,186 --> 00:40:15,357
Sir? Hello?

649
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:19,927
He wants you to be there and drive for him?

650
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:24,127
No one will say anything to him even if he sleeps out one day,

651
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:26,667
so I don't understand why he's so obsessed in getting home.

652
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,266
Tell me about it.

653
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:31,136
I'm so glad that you're resigning from that company.

654
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:34,036
Where is the car key?

655
00:40:36,377 --> 00:40:37,406
- Gosh. - Gosh, what is it?

656
00:40:38,547 --> 00:40:40,647
- Oh, no. - Let me take care of it.

657
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:43,147
- Kill it. Kill it! - Okay.

658
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:45,647
Okay, it's dead. It's dead.

659
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:48,056
Are you okay?

660
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:50,757
Do you still have arachnophobia?

661
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:54,226
Pil Nam.

662
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:57,496
Are you sure I didn't get lost when I was young?

663
00:40:58,027 --> 00:40:59,927
When I was about 4 or 5 years old.

664
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:01,467
There you go again.

665
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:03,436
Nothing like that happened before.

666
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:24,217
You liked me that much.

667
00:41:24,456 --> 00:41:26,927
No wonder why you felt so sad about running an errand...

668
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,226
to get flowers for another woman.

669
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:32,697
Secretary Kim, I'll end things with Ji Ran, okay?

670
00:41:34,496 --> 00:41:37,536
Gosh, my reasoning is so sharp.

671
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:41,377
What is he doing?

672
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:44,107
Is he talking to himself?

673
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:47,947
I'm here, sir.

674
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:08,567
You're making me embarrassed by crying again.

675
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:09,866
Are you that happy?

676
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:13,136
I'm sorry.

677
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:17,036
Throw it away.

678
00:42:18,206 --> 00:42:19,206
I'm sorry.

679
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:21,717
I'll put these flowers in the trunk.

680
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:28,487
Is it that touching?

681
00:42:29,686 --> 00:42:31,016
She's helpless.

682
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:46,607
I'm sorry.

683
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,817
Who was with you?

684
00:42:59,686 --> 00:43:00,786
It's a secret.

685
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:08,757
I'll end things with Ji Ran soon, okay?

686
00:43:09,726 --> 00:43:11,027
Are you dating another woman again?

687
00:43:11,027 --> 00:43:12,866
I'm not dating anyone for the time being, okay?

688
00:43:13,697 --> 00:43:15,467
Why do you keep asking me if I'm okay?

689
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,136
- I didn't sleep, okay? - What?

690
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:19,766
I didn't sleep with her.

691
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:22,706
You're well aware that we're business partners.

692
00:43:22,806 --> 00:43:23,976
I am.

693
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,706
I think I now know a little just how much you've suffered until now.

694
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:30,147
So take a day off tomorrow,

695
00:43:30,147 --> 00:43:32,286
and think it over again. I'm giving you a special day-off.

696
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:33,587
Really?

697
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:36,516
Oh, right. But I have an interview for my replacement tomorrow.

698
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:38,357
Then stop by shortly for the interview.

699
00:43:38,686 --> 00:43:40,186
Okay, thank you.

700
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:46,197
Did you find a place to work after your resignation?

701
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:47,726
Not yet.

702
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:49,936
You'll stay in Seoul, right?

703
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:51,406
I'm not sure about that yet either.

704
00:43:54,136 --> 00:43:57,777
Then why are you resigning without such basic plans?

705
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:01,647
I want to pick up my life now.

706
00:44:03,547 --> 00:44:05,047
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

707
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:07,746
Neither the life of someone's secretary...

708
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:09,786
nor that of someone's household,

709
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:12,587
but my own life.

710
00:44:28,536 --> 00:44:30,036
Then what about the time she spent with me?

711
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:32,346
Is it not her life?

712
00:45:04,107 --> 00:45:05,107
What?

It's me, Secretary Kim.

00:47:52,976 --> 00:47:54,206
I mean, Kim Mi So.

733

You didn't delete my number by any chance, did you?

What's gotten into you?

735
00:48:07,127 --> 00:48:09,757
You used to say that thing probably only has 0.03 percent red ginseng...

00:48:09,757 --> 00:48:11,266
and a ton of sugar.

737

She said she wants to get her life back. What on earth does it mean?

I know that she's competent and that you may feel attached to her,

747
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:47,467
but you seem to be overly bothered by it.

748
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:49,766
Do you have feelings for her by any chance?

749
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:52,467
- Have you lost your mind? - Then why are you so bothered?

750

There are so many women around you,

752
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,447

Have you had a traumatic experience with a woman or something?

887
00:58:07,127 --> 00:58:09,027
- Who said that? - What do you think of me?

888
00:58:09,826 --> 00:58:10,826
What?

889
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:13,467
I asked you what you think of me.

890
00:58:13,897 --> 00:58:16,467
Gosh, do you really have to ask?

891
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:18,806
You're just perfect.

892
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,007
You're successful, handsome, tall, and well-mannered.

893
00:58:22,476 --> 00:58:25,507
And you're sexy too.

894
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:30,647
Then what's the matter with Secretary Kim?

895
00:58:32,686 --> 00:58:33,886
What about Secretary Kim?

896
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:36,717
Are you talking about another woman in front of me right now?

897
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:01,777
(Kim Mi So)

898
00:59:09,617 --> 00:59:11,856
(To my sweetheart)

899
00:59:11,856 --> 00:59:13,056
Who is it?

900
00:59:17,056 --> 00:59:18,067
My goodness.

901
00:59:19,396 --> 00:59:21,097
What brings you here at this hour, Mr. Lee?

902
00:59:23,336 --> 00:59:25,706
- Please come in first. - Don't give me orders.

903
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:27,306
Let's just talk outside.

904
00:59:29,137 --> 00:59:30,306
Sure. Let's do that then.

905
00:59:38,947 --> 00:59:41,487
You talked about dating and marriage. Did you really mean it?

906
00:59:44,086 --> 00:59:45,487
Did you come all the way here...

907
00:59:45,487 --> 00:59:47,827
at this hour to ask me that?

908
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:49,927
Why all of a sudden?

909
00:59:49,927 --> 00:59:52,396
Have you been seeing someone behind my back?

910
00:59:53,266 --> 00:59:55,697
Mr. Lee, are you mad at me by any chance?

911
00:59:55,836 --> 00:59:58,637
No, whether you're seeing someone or not is none of my business.

912
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,806
Why would I be mad at you?

913
00:59:59,936 --> 01:00:02,106
- Exactly. - Just answer my question.

914
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:04,876
I'm not seeing anyone.

915
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:05,876
That should be the case.

916
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:06,947
- Pardon me? - What?

917
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:12,516
Even if I were seeing someone, I have no reason to hide it from you.

918
01:00:13,016 --> 01:00:14,617
And it's not like I've had any time to date.

919
01:00:14,617 --> 01:00:17,387
I had to be at work by 6am, and I never knew when I could get off.

920
01:00:17,387 --> 01:00:20,657
Whenever you called, I went to work right away even if I was sleeping.

921
01:00:21,597 --> 01:00:24,157
So what? You're not being persuasive enough.

922
01:00:26,226 --> 01:00:28,496
If I keep working like this,

923
01:00:28,496 --> 01:00:30,737
I'll probably grow old all alone and never get married.

924
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,637
So it was just for that reason?

925
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:37,436
"Just for that reason"?

926
01:00:39,706 --> 01:00:41,777
Who's going to take care of me if I get on your wrong side...

927
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:44,016
and become jobless when I'm older?

928
01:00:45,387 --> 01:00:48,186
All right. Fine. I'll guarantee that you'll never get fired.

929
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:50,617
No, thank you.

930
01:00:50,757 --> 01:00:52,786
That basically means you want me to work...

931
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:55,327
as your secretary for the rest of my life and grow old all alone.

932
01:00:59,766 --> 01:01:03,036
So you want to quit your job...

933
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:05,237
to get married.

934
01:01:06,507 --> 01:01:07,507
Yes.

935
01:01:07,507 --> 01:01:10,536
Is that how much you want to get married?

936
01:01:11,306 --> 01:01:12,347
Yes.

937
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:19,086
Then keep your job.

938
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:22,257
I, Lee Young Joon,

939
01:01:23,617 --> 01:01:24,726
will marry you.

940
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:03,627
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

941
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:04,966
I'm going to start dating now.

942
01:02:04,966 --> 01:02:07,997
Is making Secretary Kim stay like a merger and acquisition or what?

943
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:11,267
"List places you want to visit with someone you're attracted to."

944
01:02:11,267 --> 01:02:12,606
How about a pork ribs restaurant?

945
01:02:12,736 --> 01:02:14,336
- Let's go! - I'm in!

946
01:02:14,336 --> 01:02:16,636
My gosh, how long has it been?

947
01:02:16,807 --> 01:02:19,406
The imported liquors aren't doing so well in our department store.

948
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,647
It's probably not a good idea to talk about work at a company dinner.

949
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:24,446
Secretary Kim, karaoke lounges are...

950
01:02:24,946 --> 01:02:26,917
Then what do you think about leaving?

951
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,816
All right, I heard you. Why are you so chatty today?

952
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:30,986
I was just answering your question.

953
01:02:30,986 --> 01:02:33,187
See? You're talking back to me again. Secretary Kim.

954
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:34,196
Yes, sir.

955
01:02:35,227 --> 01:02:37,667
A romantic day like today...

956
01:02:37,997 --> 01:02:40,296
will be your everyday life from now on.
