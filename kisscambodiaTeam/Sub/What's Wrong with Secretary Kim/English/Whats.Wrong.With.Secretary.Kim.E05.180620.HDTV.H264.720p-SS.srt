1
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:14,358
What do you know? You don't even know love.

2
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:18,629
Do you know love then?

3
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:20,429
You've been single all your life.

4
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:24,138
I've read a lot about it in books.

5
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,068
That's great.

6
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,408
The water must be boiling.

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,179
Why is he lying face down?

8
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:40,749
No! No! Don't do that!

9
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:14,549
Just for a little while.

10
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,328
Let me stay like this for a little while.

11
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,599
From now on, I am going to be madly in love...

12
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:33,769
with you.

13
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,899
That's what it was written...

14
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:03,138
in that childish book.

15
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,308
Is this what they call romance?

16
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:14,448
You already memorized the book.

17
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,578
Your memory always surprises me.

18
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,458
Is the water still boiling?

19
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,918
- Try it. - Okay.

20
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,698
I usually don't eat food packed with chemicals.

21
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:05,129
But since you put an effort into cooking it, I will eat it.

22
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,629
Okay. I am honored.

23
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,409
What do you think?

24
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:22,478
- It's quite nice. - Is it really?

25
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:35,499
The noodles taste much better when you eat it with kimchi.

26
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,529
You just doubled up the sodium level.

27
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:41,069
Does it make sense in nutritional science?

28
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:20,038
I enjoyed the noodles.

29
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,179
You sure did. You said it was packed with chemicals,

30
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,708
but you still really enjoyed it.

31
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,578
It was my first time eating the food you cooked.

32
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:30,419
Was it?

33
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:34,249
Before you go to bed, make sure to disinfect...

34
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,189
and apply ointment to your wound.

35
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,119
I will.

36
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:53,908
Thank you...

37
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:56,609
for today.

38
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,439
(Episode 5)

39
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,609
Actually, it was his first time coming into my house.

40
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:40,018
Mr. Lee?

41
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:43,489
He didn't leave anything.

42
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:51,328
Hey.

43
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,129
What are you doing here?

44
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:54,999
Of course I'd burst in unannounced.

45
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,598
It's not like I'd make a reservation.

46
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:00,009
Here. You have beer, right?

47
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,009
Yes.

48
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,879
What's this? Was someone here?

49
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,109
What are you talking about?

50
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:13,088
Mr. Lee was here.

51
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,759
Goodness, goodness, goodness, you must be out of your mind!

52
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,259
How dare a grown woman let a man into her home!

53
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,859
All he did was eat ramen and leave.

54
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,198
What? Ramen?

55
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:27,328
Not jjolmyun or jjajangmyun, but ramen?

56
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:30,838
Is ramen that big of a deal?

57
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,038
Of course it is!

58
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:34,038
If a woman says,

59
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:38,038
"Want to eat ramen before you leave?" to a man,

60
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:41,549
they're pretty much saying, "If you eat this ramen,"

61
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:43,479
"we're dating now!"

62
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,448
It means that she likes you.

63
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,148
But it's not like it's caviar or truffles.

64
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:49,658
It's fast food that is filled with chemical additives,

65
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:51,888
yet the act of asking one to stay and eat that...

66
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,489
has that kind of meaning behind it?

67
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:55,999
Goodness, what a naive owner you are.

68
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,828
Ramen is just an excuse!

69
00:06:57,828 --> 00:06:59,929
If a man and a woman stay together in an enclosed space,

70
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:02,799
they start wanting to hold hands...

71
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,638
and embrace one another.

72
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:11,578
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

73
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,879
Did this happen between you and Ms. Kim, by any chance?

74
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,078
How could you say such a thing?

75
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:20,018
Do we seem like we have that much free time to you?

76
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:24,158
It's something that happened to my cousin's classmate from college.

77
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,288
Do I look like I have a lot of free time to you, then?

78
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,859
Do I really need to be sitting here listening to something...

79
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:31,158
that happened to your cousin's classmate from college at this hour?

80
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,239
You...

81
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,338
like your vice chairman, don't you?

82
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:43,009
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,249
You're always saying that.

84
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,479
Mi So, the thing about people is...

85
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:53,119
they'll only be happy if they date within their level.

86
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:55,888
It's not just people.

87
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:57,989
The same thing applies to everything else on this earth.

88
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,888
Have you ever seen a dog and a bird...

89
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:03,698
stick together like a couple, like on "How is that Possible?"

90
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:05,999
Dog and bird.

91
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:12,169
I'm not trying to curse.

92
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,009
So you're saying that a dog and a bird are a couple.

93
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,138
Yes. Doesn't it sound fascinating?

94
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,379
You find yourself saying, "How could this happen," right?

95
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:21,848
That's what it's like...

96
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,348
when people of two different breeds become a couple.

97
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:27,619
Does that mean that Mr. Lee is a dog,

98
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:29,288
and I'm a bird?

99
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,958
More or less.

100
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:34,489
Your vice chairman is rich, and we're just average people.

101
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,199
So we're a completely different breed.

102
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:42,938
If we tell him that we used to fight over chicken drumsticks...

103
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:45,038
when we were young,

104
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:47,268
do you think your vice chairman could understand what that's like?

105
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:48,938
The fact that we fought over...

106
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,548
a chicken drumstick, and not even a share of a company.

107
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:57,318
That's how much of a different world he lives in.

108
00:08:57,418 --> 00:09:00,288
A faraway world that we could never hope to reach.

109
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:12,298
You know that I'm only saying this because I'm worried for you, right?

110
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:15,239
I just don't want you getting hurt later on down the line.

111
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:18,839
I know.

112
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:21,109
But...

113
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,038
it's my problem to deal with.

114
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,768
Get home safely. And text me when you get home.

115
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,999
All right, I'll be going now. Go get some rest.

116
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,298
Bye.

117
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,979
I'm really worried for Mi So.

118
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:29,009
M... Mom.

119
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,379
Mom. Dad.

120
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,119
Where are you?

121
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,219
I'm scared.

122
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:40,589
I'm scared.

123
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,089
(Vice Chairman)

124
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,788
- Yes, Mr. Lee? - Where are you, Ms. Kim?

125
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,658
I'm still at home. Is there something you'd like me to do?

126
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:19,129
Are you finished getting ready for work?

127
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,359
Yes, I was just about to head out.

128
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,829
All right, hurry and come out.

129
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,428
Yes, sir. Wait, what?

130
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,129
What?

131
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:34,442
- Yes, Mr. Lee? - Where are you, Ms. Kim?

132
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:37,312
I'm still at home. Is there something you'd like me to do?

133
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:38,812
Are you finished getting ready for work?

134
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:41,182
Yes, I was just about to head out.

135
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:42,481
All right, hurry and come out.

136
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:44,081
Yes, sir. Wait, what?

137
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:46,792
What?

138
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,461
Goodness, why are you...

139
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:56,932
I'll be right out. Yes.

140
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:05,341
What brings you here so early, sir?

141
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,511
Goodness, oh no!

142
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:35,471
My apologies.

143
00:12:40,412 --> 00:12:41,682
No need to be sorry.

144
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,481
Pardon?

145
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,452
- What? - What?

146
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:49,981
All right.

147
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:57,121
Where are you going, Ms. Kim?

148
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,932
I should drive, since Mr. Yang isn't here to drive you.

149
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,101
No, I'll drive.

150
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:05,172
Pardon?

151
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:08,501
Get in, Ms. Kim.

152
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,491
Watch your head.

153
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,802
"You look pretty today."

154
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:43,841
If you wanted to hear me say something like that,

155
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,672
you should be more fashion-conscious.

156
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:48,072
- Pardon? - You wore...

157
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,312
this blouse last Wednesday and Friday too.

158
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,751
One would think that it's part of the Yumyung Group uniform.

159
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:57,381
Wednesday... and Friday.

160
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:00,221
How did you remember that?

161
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:03,692
My ridiculously good memory is a burden on me too.

162
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:06,562
Especially since there are some things that I'd rather forget.

163
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,231
Here.

164
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:20,741
What is this?

165
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:22,881
It's a croque-monsieur that my personal chef made.

166
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:24,511
You may eat it if you haven't had breakfast yet.

167
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:27,152
All right.

168
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:33,892
(Cold brew coffee)

169
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:36,662
You may drink that coffee too.

170
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:40,432
Sure.

171
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,361
You may also keep this shopping bag.

172
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:43,402
Pardon?

173
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,302
Thank you.

174
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:53,971
Now?

175
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:08,922
Let's go.

176
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:44,062
You want me to go in first?

177
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:45,831
Yes.

178
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,471
Ms. Ok, how do I look today?

179
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,442
I changed my foundation.

180
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:31,771
Gosh, check your eyes before applying foundation.

181
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,311
You have sleep in your eyes.

182
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:36,442
Gosh, since when?

183
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:39,711
Goodness!

184
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:41,682
Since 10 minutes ago.

185
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:43,422
Why are you telling me this just now?

186
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,392
Hello.

187
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:52,362
Good morning.

188
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,132
"Good morning"?

189
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:01,801
Isn't it the first time that he greeted us so sweetly like this?

190
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,041
No, he's always been sweet to me.

191
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,271
Is that right? It's strange.

192
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,882
- You sure it wasn't in your dream? - Come on.

193
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,412
By the way, why is the vice chairman in a good mood today?

194
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:16,751
I don't know.

195
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,082
You don't know?

196
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:20,991
- Let's begin working. - All right.

197
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,061
- Thanks. - Put yourself together already.

198
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:25,491
- Okay, I will. - Thanks for the food.

199
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:27,632
Give me a new one, not your food.

200
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,511
I'm so perfect.

201
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,811
In addition to having a perfect appearance,

202
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:44,041
I'm even equipped with a warm, loving heart.

203
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:00,632
Sir, let me apply some more ointment on your wound.

204
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:28,662
Would you apply it yourself?

205
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:33,162
You can just do it for me.

206
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:38,731
You read through this business plan for the second half, right? I'll...

207
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:43,541
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

208
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:50,382
I can do it myself.

209
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:55,182
I'm doing this in return for the treatment yesterday.

210
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:58,892
I always pay back what I receive.

211
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:33,821
I'm going to check documents with a tablet from now on.

212
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,491
- Pardon? - Papers are dangerous.

213
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:40,692
Okay.

214
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:05,221
What on earth is wrong with me?

215
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:18,402
What are you doing, Ms. Kim?

216
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:22,402
What? Well...

217
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,001
That.

218
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:28,781
Gosh, why is this in here?

219
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:33,251
You sometimes make mistakes too.

220
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:36,781
- Here. - Thank you.

221
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:11,422
Honey, are you okay?

222
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:14,892
Do you think I am?

223
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:19,061
My only two sons are in worse terms than strangers.

224
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:21,561
This is too upsetting.

225
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:28,902
Don't stay at home like this, and go shopping outside or something.

226
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,301
What was it? You mentioned about...

227
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:34,271
the limited edition handbag.

228
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:35,912
Go buy it.

229
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:37,882
- Forget it. - Why?

230
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,912
You have enough money and grace,

231
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,221
so buy that bag right now.

232
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:45,291
- I said, forget it. - Goodness.

233
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:51,321
Mr. Choi, go to a department store right now...

234
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:53,132
I said it's okay.

235
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:54,461
What do you mean, it's okay?

236
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:57,531
- Buy that bag immediately. - I bought it already.

237
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:01,602
- What? - I bought it last week...

238
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:02,971
as soon as it was released.

239
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:04,771
Goodness.

240
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:09,011
Is that right?

241
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:12,882
I see.

242
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:27,432
When are you going to apologize to Young Joon?

243
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:29,202
What?

244
00:22:30,162 --> 00:22:31,231
Well...

245
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:36,301
Your mom is so worried that she can't sleep at night.

246
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:39,971
Reconcile with him already so that she feels much more at ease.

247
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:43,781
- Okay, I will. - Good.

248
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:46,481
Oh, one more thing.

249
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:49,251
Don't bother Young Joon from now on.

250
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,491
He has a lot of important projects to handle these days.

251
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:54,961
If he gets swayed, our company and all the employees...

252
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:56,922
will get swayed along with him.

253
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:07,501
All right.

254
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:11,942
Ms. Kim, there's a visitor waiting in the lobby.

255
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,412
Is it my visitor? What's their name?

256
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:17,511
I didn't get to ask about it.

257
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:20,082
Check their personal information next time.

258
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:21,721
Okay, sorry.

259
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:40,332
Are you my visitor?

260
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:41,571
Yes, that's right.

261
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,311
How did you know my name and which department I'm in?

262
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:47,872
You don't seem so glad to see me.

263
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:50,511
Of course, I'm not. There's no reason for me to be glad to see you.

264
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:53,382
I did think you were quite rude...

265
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:55,352
when you asked me for my number in such a clingy way.

266
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:58,422
But it's really not right to visit me here at my work.

267
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:00,952
Should I just go then?

268
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:02,221
Yes, please go.

269
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:03,991
That's too harsh.

270
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,132
You asked me to see you by email first.

271
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:07,791
When did I?

272
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,862
You wanted me to hold a book concert at Yumyung Art Center.

273
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:12,001
When did I...

274
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:21,041
Don't tell me... Are you Morpheus?

275
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:30,152
I'm sorry.

276
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:32,592
I'm a huge fan of your books,

277
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:35,791
but I made a big mistake because I didn't know your face.

278
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,761
That's enough for apologizing. Why don't you eat a little?

279
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:43,702
You haven't eaten much since you were checking my reaction.

280
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,071
Okay.

281
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:10,892
- Excuse me. - Yes?

282
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,862
May I help you?

283
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:18,771
I'm sorry, but can you put this vase away?

284
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:20,602
She's allergic to flowers.

285
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,442
Okay, I'll do it right away.

286
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:29,811
How did you know I was allergic to flowers?

287
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,112
How could I not know?

288
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:34,011
You looked around as you sniffed your nose.

289
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:36,682
Then you spotted the flowers...

290
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:40,051
and made a look that you found the cause.

291
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:44,192
Maybe it's because you're a writer, but you're very delicate.

292
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:48,961
So did you read through the proposal?

293
00:25:50,602 --> 00:25:52,771
Well, briefly.

294
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:55,342
What's your answer?

295
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:57,672
Should I answer right now?

296
00:25:57,842 --> 00:25:59,112
Pardon?

297
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:07,781
What's wrong?

298
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:09,682
There's a stone in my food.

299
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:11,622
Really? Gosh, why those people...

300
00:26:11,622 --> 00:26:13,221
Forget it. I'm okay.

301
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,021
I didn't know my superior was this generous.

302
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:20,162
Anyone can make mistakes.

303
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,771
You seem to be in a happy mood. Are you up to something good?

304
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,001
"Something good"?

305
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:33,771
What, are they finally going out or something?

306
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:35,711
What?

307
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:39,582
I mean, about your college friend whom you talked about last time.

308
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:41,521
Is he finally going out with that girl?

309
00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:43,021
No, not yet.

310
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:44,682
Not yet?

311
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:48,122
Gosh, that friend of yours doesn't know how to take actions.

312
00:26:48,392 --> 00:26:49,761
I can tell...

313
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:56,102
- he's horrible at dating. - What?

314
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,031
How could you say that?

315
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:02,102
I'm only talking about your friend, so why are you getting worked up?

316
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:03,402
He's my close friend.

317
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,112
How could you say that he's horrible at dating?

318
00:27:09,912 --> 00:27:11,751
I'm just feeling frustrated. That's all.

319
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:14,051
You don't need to. He'll express his feelings soon.

320
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:16,251
Tell him to do it quickly while he's put his mind to it.

321
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:20,092
Girls hate beating around the bush.

322
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,251
Really?

323
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,862
Let's stop talking about this boring topic and focus on eating.

324
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,231
Okay.

325
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,672
Call me after thinking about it.

326
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:44,241
You'll give me your real number this time, right?

327
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:47,452
Sure.

328
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:52,491
Here.

329
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:05,872
Express my feelings?

330
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:11,442
I just want an ordinary romance with an ordinary man.

331
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:16,842
Does she want an ordinary profession too?

332
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:22,221
My entire life has been exceptional,

333
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:25,021
so I can't figure out what or how to be ordinary.

334
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:47,642
Ms. Kim.

335
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,781
Yes. Is there anything you need?

336
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:54,211
Well...

337
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:57,821
I have something to ask.

338
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:02,791
Do you need anything, sir?

339
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,061
- What? - He has something to ask.

340
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:06,561
Go on.

341
00:29:08,602 --> 00:29:09,702
Well, that's...

342
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:15,202
Is the opening preparation for the art center going all right?

343
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:18,612
Yes, the planning team will have a meeting in a minute.

344
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:19,711
Okay, good.

345
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,221
Did you have a good meeting with your visitor?

346
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:30,652
Yes.

347
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:34,051
Who was it? Was it your future boyfriend?

348
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:36,092
No way. That's not the case.

349
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:39,531
It's someone you'll love to see as well.

350
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:40,632
Do I know that person?

351
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:42,662
I'll tell you when it becomes more certain.

352
00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:56,211
Mr. Jung. Let me ask you something.

353
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,352
Okay, ask me anything.

354
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:04,382
Do you know a trendy restaurant...

355
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:06,922
frequented by ordinary people these days?

356
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:09,561
- What? - A restaurant...

357
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:11,061
where people can talk about important issues.

358
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,501
There's a tripe restaurant in Hapjeong,

359
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,162
and it's really popular.

360
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:19,301
- Tripe? - Yes.

361
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:22,501
Drinking a shot of soju with grilled tripe...

362
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:24,571
is perfect for honest talks.

363
00:30:24,771 --> 00:30:27,571
They make fried rice with kimchi sauce too.

364
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:29,682
It tastes fantastic.

365
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,721
Not a place like that.

366
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:39,152
Somewhere ordinary but special.

367
00:30:39,152 --> 00:30:41,761
Somewhere ordinary but special?

368
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,721
Near Gangnam Station,

369
00:30:44,932 --> 00:30:47,192
there's a restaurant that serves special cuts.

370
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:50,531
From entrails to heart and stomach,

371
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:52,902
they serve assorted special cuts.

372
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,071
It's a place where they serve meat parts...

373
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:57,872
that aren't usually served in other restaurants.

374
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,142
Do you have something else other than animal intestines?

375
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:07,251
Well, something else?

376
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,251
Never mind.

378
00:31:26,202 --> 00:31:27,602
Hello, Mr. Lee.

379
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:29,172
Is Mr. Park inside?

380
00:31:29,372 --> 00:31:30,741
Yes, he is.

381
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:35,082
(President Park Yoo Shik)

382
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:37,682
He isn't inside.

383
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,682
Where did he go?

384
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:44,852
How would I know?

385
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:47,791
Where did he go?

386
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,132
Well...

387
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:06,041
Can I ask you about something?

388
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:07,541
Go ahead.

389
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:11,112
Do you know a trendy restaurant frequented by ordinary people?

390
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:13,781
Somewhere trendy, favored by young women.

391
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:15,382
Young women?

392
00:32:16,321 --> 00:32:18,452
Did you get a new girlfriend by any chance?

393
00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:22,061
That's not it. I'm thinking about a franchise business.

394
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:25,061
Women in their 20s and 30s are the targeted customers.

395
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:30,632
There's a good place. Let me show you a picture.

396
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,702
I even took a selfie there yesterday.

397
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:37,672
What women in their 20s and 30s like is...

398
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:39,942
spicy chicken feet.

399
00:32:43,082 --> 00:32:46,382
If you don't like the idea, how about spicy pork trotters?

400
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:48,882
Never mind.

401
00:32:52,692 --> 00:32:54,221
But they are delicious.

402
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:02,632
Mr. Yang, do you know any restaurant favored by women?

403
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:06,402
I bet you don't.

404
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:11,872
Chef Raymon's restaurant in Sinsa-dong.

405
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:14,212
Chef Kim Won Suk's restaurant in Cheongdam-dong.

406
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:16,441
Those are the popular restaurants.

407
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:21,781
Ji Ah.

408
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:24,452
- It's time for the meeting. - Oh, okay.

409
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:31,462
Our vice chairman...

410
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:33,761
is handsome as is,

411
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:37,031
but he's really sexy when he's working.

412
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:48,741
Don't you think he's sexy too?

413
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:52,881
I see him every day, so I'm not quite sure about that.

414
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:56,421
- I see. Let's go. - I'll see you later.

415
00:34:26,952 --> 00:34:30,122
(An ordinary but special and simple but fancy place to profess)

416
00:34:30,122 --> 00:34:32,852
(A good place to profess your love)

417
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:36,361
Perfect.

418
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:47,071
Why can't the art center be in charge of the opening ceremony?

419
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:53,011
Hello.

420
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:54,982
Hello.

421
00:35:10,122 --> 00:35:11,462
Excuse me, you have something on your...

422
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:13,191
Thank you.

423
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:22,372
I heard that he bought 10 of the exact same suits...

424
00:35:22,502 --> 00:35:23,741
and wears nothing else...

425
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,971
because he'd much rather get work done...

426
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:27,241
in the time he has to decide what to wear.

427
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:29,042
That's so impressive.

428
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:35,551
All right.

429
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,821
To me, it definitely looks like a grain of rice.

430
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:41,962
If he has 10 suits, he should change into a different one.

431
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:44,792
Does he actually have 10 of the exact same suits?

432
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:51,471
I'm sorry.

433
00:35:53,102 --> 00:35:54,102
Gosh.

434
00:35:55,272 --> 00:35:56,702
Shall we begin the meeting?

435
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:58,102
- Yes, let's do that. - Okay.

436
00:35:58,841 --> 00:35:59,841
All right.

437
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:02,812
Shall we? Shall we just get started?

438
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:06,381
Yes, Mom.

439
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:09,281
You want me to go on another blind date?

440
00:36:10,221 --> 00:36:12,292
What does this guy do? Do you have a photo of him?

441
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:14,091
Send it to me now. Okay.

442
00:36:14,691 --> 00:36:17,662
- Thank you. - Thank you.

443
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,571
What's that?

444
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:29,602
This button fell off Mr. Ko's suit.

445
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:31,272
Nice, score.

446
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,142
I'll ask him out to dinner as I'm giving this to him.

447
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:35,412
You should just give it to him now.

448
00:36:35,412 --> 00:36:36,781
He needs that button.

449
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:39,852
I think he only has that one suit.

450
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:40,912
Are you at it again?

451
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:43,721
Why do you keep bad-mouthing him and saying he only has one suit?

452
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,721
I'm not bad-mouthing him. It's a fact.

453
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,721
I saw a grain of rice stuck on the exact same spot for two days.

454
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:50,562
When I saw him earlier, it looked like he took it off,

455
00:36:50,562 --> 00:36:52,232
but I could still see a trace of it,

456
00:36:52,232 --> 00:36:53,792
which means he's wearing the same suit...

457
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,162
without even washing it.

458
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:57,801
Are you a detective or what?

459
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:06,042
Gosh, I told you that he has 10 suits.

460
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:07,471
No, he only has one.

461
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:08,982
I told you he has 10!

462
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:11,511
- I'm sure he only has one. - Enough, you two.

463
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,881
Who cares how many suits he has?

464
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:14,952
Clothes aren't that important.

465
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:16,982
Right, you're living proof of that.

466
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:19,491
She barely has any clothes, and yet she's still so good at her job.

467
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:21,622
- Sorry? - That blouse.

468
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:23,921
Didn't you wear it last Wednesday and Friday as well?

469
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:30,031
You wore that blouse last Wednesday and Friday as well.

470
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,571
People will assume that it's our uniform.

471
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:36,602
You wore it on Thursday two weeks ago too.

472
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,712
Gosh, she wore it on Tuesday three weeks ago as well...

473
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,872
Enough, okay?

474
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:42,741
Clothes aren't everything.

475
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,312
It sounds like you only care about clothes.

476
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:47,352
- Ji Ah, pour the water in. - Okay.

477
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:07,332
Is the dinner with the chairman of UK Group this evening?

478
00:38:07,772 --> 00:38:09,372
Yes. sir. It's at 6pm today.

479
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:13,011
It sounds like he wants to talk to me about something important,

480
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:14,571
so you don't have to come with me.

481
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:17,741
- Sure. I'll leave for the day... - How about 8pm?

482
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:19,752
Pardon me?

483
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:22,952
Let's have a glass of wine together.

484
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:29,122
I have something to tell you.

485
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:34,462
Something to tell me?

486
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:42,971
Then I'll make a reservation...

487
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:45,272
at the lounge at Illusion Hotel, which the company bought recently.

488
00:38:45,841 --> 00:38:47,412
That way, we can see what it's like there.

489
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:51,011
That's not necessary. I already made a reservation elsewhere.

490
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:52,912
Sorry?

491
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,482
You made a reservation yourself?

492
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:48,571
- Excuse me. - Yes.

493
00:39:49,671 --> 00:39:51,202
May I try this on?

494
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:52,571
My gosh, I'm sorry.

495
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:54,471
We're sold out of size 44.

496
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:56,611
You can place a special order though.

497
00:39:57,781 --> 00:40:00,352
That's okay. I need something that I can change into right now.

498
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:01,881
- Right now? - Yes.

499
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:04,051
Oh, I guess you have a date.

500
00:40:06,522 --> 00:40:07,622
A date?

501
00:40:09,122 --> 00:40:10,491
No, not at all.

502
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:15,761
I'll pick something else.

503
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:29,082
Yes, hello.

504
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:30,912
You're done for the day, right? What are you up to?

505
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:32,752
I have plans this evening.

506
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,651
Really? Where are you going?

507
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:36,321
The lounge at M Hotel.

508
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:39,292
I'm nearby.

509
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:40,491
Can we meet up briefly?

510
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:42,392
Not right now.

511
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:45,631
Like I told you, I have plans this evening.

512
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,401
I'm asking if we can meet up because I want to give you my answer.

513
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:51,432
I may have a change of heart if we don't meet up now.

514
00:40:51,571 --> 00:40:54,571
Wait. I don't have much time though.

515
00:40:54,772 --> 00:40:57,502
Don't worry. I just need 10 minutes of your time.

516
00:40:59,142 --> 00:41:00,212
Okay.

517
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:11,591
This is the limited edition champagne you asked for, sir.

518
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:13,691
Please bring it out later with the cake.

519
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:22,932
A bottle of champagne makes the best congratulatory gift.

520
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:25,002
Ms. Kim,

521
00:41:25,732 --> 00:41:26,932
congratulations in advance.

522
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:29,502
You'll be the one and only woman getting...

523
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,071
an honest, genuine profession from me.

524
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:36,682
She'll be here soon.

525
00:41:49,261 --> 00:41:50,321
Morpheus.

526
00:41:54,462 --> 00:41:57,002
You look even more stunning than you did earlier today.

527
00:41:58,272 --> 00:42:00,571
I guess you're meeting someone important.

528
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:01,841
Sorry?

529
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:03,741
Oh, well...

530
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,881
We shouldn't be standing like this,

531
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:10,281
I don't have much time right now.

532
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:12,912
So what do you say? Have you made up your mind?

533
00:42:13,682 --> 00:42:17,182
Yes, I've decided to trust you and do it.

534
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:18,522
Really?

535
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:20,921
Thank you.

536
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:23,821
I wanted to meet you soon because I knew you'd be happy.

537
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,301
("Once in a Lifetime")

538
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:33,832
Isn't that your newest book coming out next week?

539
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:35,642
Take it.

540
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:38,272
I'm giving it to you as a gift as we'll be working together.

541
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:39,841
Thank you.

542
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:43,312
You'll be even more grateful when you open it.

543
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:44,812
There's my autograph inside.

544
00:42:47,182 --> 00:42:49,022
(Serendipity brought us together, but maybe we were...)

545
00:42:49,022 --> 00:42:50,752
(meant to cross paths. Lee Sung Yeon)

546
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:00,078
Take it.

547
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:02,678
I'm giving it to you as a gift as we'll be working together.

548
00:43:02,817 --> 00:43:04,178
Thank you.

549
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,848
You'll be even more grateful when you open it.

550
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,218
There's my autograph inside.

551
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:13,457
(Serendipity brought us together, but maybe we were...)

552
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,198
(meant to cross paths. Lee Sung Yeon)

553
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:23,868
Mr. Lee.

554
00:43:29,437 --> 00:43:30,877
Mr. Lee, why are you being like this?

555
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:41,788
Could you please explain why you're being like this?

556
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:43,488
You explain first.

557
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:44,928
What on earth is going on now?

558
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:48,058
He's the author, Morpheus.

559
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:50,328
He came here to tell me that he decided...

560
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:51,768
to do the book concert at our art center.

561
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:54,328
When did you start working on this?

562
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:55,768
I told you about it a while ago, sir.

563
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:59,308
I said it'd be nice to invite a famous author for the grand opening.

564
00:43:59,308 --> 00:44:01,268
He was the famous author...

565
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:02,477
- you were talking about? - Yes.

566
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:04,107
Why didn't you give me any updates?

567
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:07,707
I thought it'd be meaningless to do that before it became concrete.

568
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:09,018
Don't do it.

569
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,618
- Pardon me? Why... - Just don't do it.

570
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,718
May I ask you why?

571
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,058
Do I have to explain everything to you?

572
00:44:18,428 --> 00:44:19,957
I just don't like the idea.

573
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:31,908
You said you have something to tell me.

574
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:33,968
Can I hear it another time if it's not urgent?

575
00:44:36,738 --> 00:44:39,607
Sure, it wasn't even about anything important.

576
00:44:45,718 --> 00:44:47,288
Then I'll get going, sir.

577
00:45:16,078 --> 00:45:17,678
- Are you all right, sir? - We're sorry.

578
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:19,018
I'm okay.

579
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:21,147
What was I thinking? I just ended up getting my feelings hurt.

580
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:30,158
What's up? I'm surprised that you asked me first to meet up.

581
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:35,727
What do you want?

582
00:46:37,198 --> 00:46:38,297
Nothing.

583
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:41,227
I just wanted to help the company, that's all.

584
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:44,198
- What? - Ms. Kim said...

585
00:46:44,198 --> 00:46:46,808
that my involvement will help the company a lot.

586
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:54,678
What's with that face?

587
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:57,678
Are you scared?

588
00:46:58,388 --> 00:46:59,848
Do you think I'll take her from you?

589
00:47:02,258 --> 00:47:03,417
Of course not.

590
00:47:04,317 --> 00:47:05,558
But you look scared.

591
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:10,258
Shall I not do it if you're that scared?

592
00:47:12,868 --> 00:47:15,868
No, go ahead and do it.

593
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:18,408
- What? - I don't care...

594
00:47:18,638 --> 00:47:19,908
whether you do it or not.

595
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:23,477
If you thought that you'd have an influence on her or the company,

596
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,277
you overestimated yourself.

597
00:47:30,078 --> 00:47:31,377
You can't do anything.

598
00:48:08,758 --> 00:48:11,417
Ms. Kim, I had my reasons...

599
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:13,258
for getting mad at you last night.

600
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:21,667
Ms. Kim, I'm willing to forgive you if you apologize to me...

601
00:48:21,837 --> 00:48:23,397
for getting angry at me last night.

602
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:28,308
Ms. Kim, I'm sorry...

603
00:48:37,817 --> 00:48:40,988
It'd be nice to escort her into the restaurant.

604
00:48:41,758 --> 00:48:43,357
I should wait for her outside.

605
00:48:44,558 --> 00:48:45,727
I'm so awesome.

606
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,567
I'm giving it to you as a gift as we'll be working together.

607
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:54,067
Thank you.

608
00:48:54,227 --> 00:48:56,038
You'll be even more grateful when you open it.

609
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:57,368
There's my autograph inside.

610
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:13,618
Mr. Lee is here.

611
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:15,988
Good morning, Mr. Lee.

612
00:49:20,788 --> 00:49:22,397
He said "Good morning" to us yesterday.

613
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:23,627
Is this a bad morning or what?

614
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,328
I know, right? He seems a bit different today.

615
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,768
I haven't seen you running around like that for a while.

616
00:49:27,828 --> 00:49:28,937
What's going on?

617
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:34,337
There's big news.

618
00:49:34,877 --> 00:49:36,808
Only those who can handle it should gather around.

619
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:39,408
- Come on. Gather around, guys. - What is it?

620
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:41,448
You know...

621
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:44,348
that we're planning an opening event for the art center's library, right?

622
00:49:46,047 --> 00:49:48,518
It'll be the author Morpheus' book concert.

623
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,357
- What? - No way.

624
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:52,658
- It must be a groundless rumor. - Why don't you guys believe me?

625
00:49:53,187 --> 00:49:54,587
- I just heard... - Mr. Jung.

626
00:49:54,727 --> 00:49:55,727
Yes?

627
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,598
Where did you hear that rumor?

628
00:49:57,598 --> 00:49:59,098
Those in the PR team told me.

629
00:49:59,098 --> 00:50:01,797
I heard Mr. Lee told them...

630
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:03,468
to send out a press release about it soon.

631
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:04,738
Sorry?

632
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:28,227
Is it true that you gave the PR team...

633
00:50:28,227 --> 00:50:30,457
the go-ahead to start working on Morpheus' book concert?

634
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:43,377
Yes, it's true.

635
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:46,877
Yesterday, you said that you'd never allow it.

636
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,618
May I ask why you suddenly changed your mind?

637
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:57,457
Right, you don't have to explain everything to me.

638
00:51:02,297 --> 00:51:03,828
Please do not cross the line again.

639
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:08,997
To tell you the truth, I got the wrong idea.

640
00:51:09,497 --> 00:51:11,238
You asked me to date you and marry you,

641
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:13,337
and you started being all nice to me, so I thought...

642
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:15,977
that you might actually mean it.

643
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:20,008
Ms. Kim.

644
00:51:20,308 --> 00:51:21,477
Please don't...

645
00:51:22,718 --> 00:51:24,047
confuse me ever again.

646
00:51:43,538 --> 00:51:45,167
That's what I'm saying.

647
00:51:46,638 --> 00:51:47,707
It's Mr. Ko.

648
00:51:48,908 --> 00:51:51,977
Oh, no. I forgot to bring his button.

649
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:53,977
You have to give it to him soon.

650
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:56,218
He only has that one suit, you know. It must be uncomfortable.

651
00:51:56,218 --> 00:51:57,777
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

652
00:51:57,777 --> 00:51:59,587
Why do you keep making such a false claim?

653
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:02,118
It's not a false claim. I have evidence to prove...

654
00:52:03,058 --> 00:52:04,218
Do you want to bet?

655
00:52:05,357 --> 00:52:06,957
The button fell off yesterday,

656
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,457
so the jacket he's wearing today must be missing a button.

657
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:12,067
Why? Because he only has that one suit.

658
00:52:12,067 --> 00:52:13,598
I think you got the wrong idea.

659
00:52:14,937 --> 00:52:16,038
Hello.

660
00:52:17,897 --> 00:52:19,008
Have a good look.

661
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:21,738
See if this jacket is missing any button.

662
00:52:22,578 --> 00:52:24,207
- Well... - There are four here.

663
00:52:24,638 --> 00:52:25,707
Another four here.

664
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:26,808
Two buttons here.

665
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:28,977
And one on each inside pocket.

666
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:30,578
And...

667
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:33,547
I even have a spare button.

668
00:52:34,388 --> 00:52:35,758
All buttons are intact.

669
00:52:36,457 --> 00:52:38,788
I'm sorry. I made a big mistake.

670
00:52:38,928 --> 00:52:41,227
- I'll take you out for a drink... - No, thanks.

671
00:52:42,027 --> 00:52:45,598
Please do not spread any false rumors from now on.

672
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:50,797
- I'm really sorry. - How about we go out for a beer?

673
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:52,908
If you don't like beer, we can have soju or beer.

674
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:54,538
Oh, I already said beer. How about makgeolli?

675
00:52:54,768 --> 00:52:55,877
Gosh, darn it.

676
00:52:56,008 --> 00:52:58,747
What did I tell you? I told you to stop playing a detective.

677
00:53:20,328 --> 00:53:23,797
She seems really angry. What should I do?

678
00:53:50,598 --> 00:53:51,698
Gosh, my head.

679
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,428
My head... head hurts.

680
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:58,567
Yes, Dr. Choi. Mr. Lee has a headache.

681
00:53:58,607 --> 00:54:01,067
- Can he visit you at 10am... - It's not that bad.

682
00:54:01,607 --> 00:54:04,008
He says it's not that bad.

683
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,977
I emailed the speech you will be making at the welfare center's

684
00:54:43,977 --> 00:54:45,187
ceremony next week to you.

685
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,448
Please check it.

686
00:54:49,857 --> 00:54:52,957
I think my tie might be a little loose.

687
00:55:14,348 --> 00:55:15,417
Ms. Kim.

688
00:55:17,477 --> 00:55:20,687
I came with another big news.

689
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:23,087
- What is it? - I was talking to the PR team...

690
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,727
about the book concert of Morpheus' writer.

691
00:55:27,627 --> 00:55:29,397
And they told me something shocking.

692
00:55:30,258 --> 00:55:31,328
Ms. Kim,

693
00:55:32,727 --> 00:55:34,797
can you handle this news?

694
00:55:35,368 --> 00:55:36,598
I will try.

695
00:55:36,598 --> 00:55:37,837
Don't be surprised.

696
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:42,008
The writer of Morpheus is Mr. Lee's elder brother.

697
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:47,377
What?

698
00:55:47,408 --> 00:55:49,877
It's real. It's true. It is the truth.

699
00:55:50,078 --> 00:55:53,247
Morpheus is the eldest son of Yumyung Group.

700
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,288
Isn't this really big news?

701
00:55:59,928 --> 00:56:03,198
Last time, you asked me about Mr. Lee's brother.

702
00:56:03,258 --> 00:56:06,268
I remembered that. That's why I ran to you with the news.

703
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:14,038
The eldest son suddenly appeared.

704
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,808
Shouldn't that mean that there's been a change...

705
00:56:17,977 --> 00:56:20,547
in the succession plan?

706
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,258
I fought a lot with my brother's friends.

707
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:36,198
They said I was rude and picked fights with me.

708
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:39,828
But I guess you were fine because you were with your brother.

709
00:56:40,227 --> 00:56:41,397
No.

710
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:45,268
He was worse. He's the worst sort of man.

711
00:56:47,008 --> 00:56:49,578
It seemed like he isn't in good terms with his brother.

712
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:52,308
What?

713
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:55,047
How do you say sorry?

714
00:56:57,317 --> 00:57:00,488
How hard is that? "I'm sorry." Just say that.

715
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:03,317
Do you know what "I'm sorry" is in Spanish?

716
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:08,558
It's "Lo siento." Give it a try.

717
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:11,198
Lo sie...

718
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,797
Never mind.

719
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,397
You can't say it because awkward. You've never said it before.

720
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:20,337
That's what "I'm sorry" is to me.

721
00:57:20,707 --> 00:57:22,437
I've never said it before.

722
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:28,377
Is there no way I can make up with her without saying sorry?

723
00:57:29,348 --> 00:57:30,578
There is no way.

724
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:34,488
Then...

725
00:57:35,457 --> 00:57:36,857
what if I don't say it?

726
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:40,087
You will be losing that person.

727
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:53,768
Ms. Kim.

728
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,817
Do you have something to say?

729
00:59:19,888 --> 00:59:21,027
I...

730
00:59:25,198 --> 00:59:26,368
I apologize.

731
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:28,468
What?

732
00:59:31,397 --> 00:59:32,508
I am sorry.

733
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:38,107
No, I'm sorry.

734
00:59:39,107 --> 00:59:41,848
You wouldn't get upset without a reason.

735
00:59:42,047 --> 00:59:44,777
I became too emotional.

736
00:59:52,027 --> 00:59:54,687
But please know this.

737
00:59:55,727 --> 00:59:58,928
I did it because I thought it would do you good.

738
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:05,138
I know that much.

739
01:00:57,917 --> 01:01:01,227
You should want to celebrate our reconciliation with a nice dinner.

740
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,527
But we have so much work to get done.

741
01:01:03,828 --> 01:01:04,997
It's okay.

742
01:01:06,027 --> 01:01:09,738
You should be okay. I couldn't work because I was too bothered by you.

743
01:01:10,538 --> 01:01:11,607
What?

744
01:01:35,727 --> 01:01:37,558
Do you want some coffee?

745
01:01:38,468 --> 01:01:39,598
It's here.

746
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,937
It's a little hot in here. Should I open the window?

747
01:01:44,038 --> 01:01:45,937
- It's open. - It is.

748
01:02:04,957 --> 01:02:06,058
Ms. Kim.

749
01:02:07,788 --> 01:02:08,797
Yes?

750
01:02:10,797 --> 01:02:11,968
A while ago,

751
01:02:14,727 --> 01:02:16,598
you told me never to stir you up again.

752
01:02:18,707 --> 01:02:20,868
That was...

753
01:02:27,107 --> 01:02:28,107
I...

754
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,488
want to stir you up.

755
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:42,158
What? That's...

756
01:03:40,587 --> 01:03:41,758
Ms. Kim.

757
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:16,288
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

758
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:19,587
- It's sexual desire disorder. - Sexual what?

759
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:21,857
You're mistaken. It's nothing like that.

760
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:23,957
- My gosh, Mr. Lee. - Did you call me?

761
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,997
Give me a chance to make up for my mistake.

762
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,098
How much is this machine?

763
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:36,308
I think I was locked in an empty house for a day.

764
01:04:36,308 --> 01:04:39,308
There was a boy next to me.

765
01:04:40,678 --> 01:04:42,777
I never knew he was so near me.
