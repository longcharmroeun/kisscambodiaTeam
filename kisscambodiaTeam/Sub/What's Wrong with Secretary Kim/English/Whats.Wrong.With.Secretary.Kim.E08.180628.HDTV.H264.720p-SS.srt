1
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:15,103
I'll let you do whatever you want to do...

2
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:16,742
and tell you everything you want to know.

3
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:19,412
I will.

4
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:22,342
You can do everything you wish to do.

5
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:30,123
I will bear it.

6
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:32,923
I am confident...

7
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,562
to bear everything about you.

8
00:00:46,973 --> 00:00:48,643
This is...

9
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:51,312
where you belong anyway.

10
00:01:14,563 --> 00:01:15,962
Mr. Lee.

11
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:21,542
You said you will tell me everything I want to know, right?

12
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:26,843
I am curious about something.

13
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:28,843
What is it?

14
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,512
I will bear whatever question you might have.

15
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:34,182
When we nearly kissed,

16
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:36,522
why did you push me?

17
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:40,053
You said you would bear any questions. Hurry and tell me.

18
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:42,322
You don't act without reason.

19
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:44,223
But no matter how much I think about it,

20
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:46,262
I can't understand what could be the reason for it.

21
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:51,233
Well, that is...

22
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:07,682
When I close my eyes, I sometimes see a ghost.

23
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:09,853
What?

24
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,122
Since when?

25
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:15,893
Is it related to that nightmare you sometimes have?

26
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:24,532
Why?

27
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:26,203
Are you going to contact an exorcist for me?

28
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,872
This isn't a joke.

29
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:30,002
There's a ghost behind you!

30
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,043
My mistake.

31
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:36,883
Are you playing around with me right now?

32
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,013
You were just joking when you told me...

33
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,252
that you can see ghosts, weren't you?

34
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:44,622
You're so mean.

35
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:50,122
Over there.

36
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,073
Wait up, Ms. Kim.

37
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:08,782
- Cheers. - Cheers.

38
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:10,282
(Episode 8)

39
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:22,763
You're working even while you're drinking, Gui Nam?

40
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:26,263
Yes, because I believe that working is the best drinking snack.

41
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:28,133
And it doesn't even give me a hangover the next day.

42
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:31,733
By the way, do you not drink, Mr. Yang?

43
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:35,272
No. I always need to be prepared for any situation,

44
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:36,673
so I'm always on standby.

45
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,212
You're just like Ms. Kim.

46
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:41,742
Then you must not be able to date anyone.

47
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,453
What kind of woman is your ideal type?

48
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:52,423
I like women who are cute.

49
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:57,122
You mean, like me?

50
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,203
Did you just get back, Mr. Lee?

51
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,932
You must have gotten drenched, Mr. Lee.

52
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:08,842
Goodness, that must have been so rough on you.

53
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,312
Not at all.

54
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:13,812
It was quite a meaningful time.

55
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:16,242
What do you mean by "meaningful?"

56
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:25,423
We were able to have quite a productive conversation...

57
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:27,653
about the overall affairs and duties of those at our company...

58
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:29,723
while we took shelter from the rain.

59
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:35,502
I don't think so.

60
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:38,103
Something feels off.

61
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:41,543
Now that I think about it, you two were also on the same team...

62
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:42,742
for the ribbon-hunting game.

63
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:46,113
And you two came back around nightfall.

64
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:52,113
Did you two, by any chance,

65
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,363
go off and eat beef without us?

66
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:04,492
All we had was pork!

67
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:06,293
Was there something wrong with the pork you had?

68
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:09,202
Get it together, Ms. Seol!

69
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,202
Mr. Lee.

70
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:12,702
You must be quite hungry.

71
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,742
Allow me to grill you some meat.

72
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:16,773
- Sure, thank you. - Sit here, sir.

73
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:19,543
- Please sit here. - Sit over here.

74
00:05:25,512 --> 00:05:26,682
The meat!

75
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,023
Where did it all go?

76
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:32,053
- I grilled it all. - All of it?

77
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:34,622
I told you to leave some for the vice chairman!

78
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:37,892
You said, "Let's leave some for him."

79
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,233
So I assumed that you'd already taken care doing that yourself.

80
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:41,762
You should have been more clear...

81
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:43,903
and said, "Leave some for him."

82
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:46,903
Are you kidding me right now?

83
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:48,442
What do we do?

84
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:50,273
We don't have any more food left.

85
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:53,413
I was in the Special Unit in the army,

86
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,582
so I'll jump into the water right now and catch us some fish.

87
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:57,082
And I'll make some spicy fish stew with them.

88
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:58,913
No, sir.

89
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:01,483
I'll go and buy some pork right now.

90
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:02,983
You had alcohol, though.

91
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:04,593
And it takes 30 minutes to drive to the store.

92
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:06,523
So it'll take one hour to make a round trip.

93
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,593
Then let's just eat that.

94
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,463
You're okay with that, right?

95
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,733
You like ramen, sir.

96
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:21,872
The vice chairman eats ramen?

97
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:26,213
I tried it for the first time not too long ago, and it wasn't bad.

98
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,113
Let's eat ramen, then.

99
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:29,283
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:30,642
Well, then...

101
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:32,913
I'll hurry and boil some water.

102
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,702
It's the first time that you've come to a workshop,

103
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:54,603
so it would've been nice if you could've had some char-grilled food.

104
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:55,673
What a shame.

105
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:57,973
Are you sure that you're not the one who's disappointed?

106
00:06:58,142 --> 00:06:59,413
Of course I'm disappointed.

107
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,283
Having char-grilled meat outdoors in a place like this...

108
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:02,713
is quite delicious, after all.

109
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,783
- You can eat it now. - All right.

110
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,132
It's hot.

111
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:20,593
Here.

112
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:29,742
Use this to eat it.

113
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:34,312
What's this?

114
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:36,613
It's a life hack for when you're eating cup noodles.

115
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:38,812
The noodles won't be hot at all if you put them in here first.

116
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:44,723
Just a second.

117
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,523
Slurp.

118
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,033
- Slurp. - Slurp.

119
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:54,093
Slurp?

120
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:55,603
Then you put it in here.

121
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:03,242
It's not that hot now, isn't it?

122
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:05,442
What a good idea.

123
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:10,913
Slurp, slurp.

124
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:13,882
- Put some kimchi here. - What?

125
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:15,952
It'll taste better if you put it there for me.

126
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:19,593
Here you go.

127
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,383
You're going to sleep already?

128
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,812
Let's just have one more round of shots. Please?

129
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:45,153
Just one more.

130
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:49,682
Oh man.

131
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:53,352
All of you are tucked in already? I'll turn the lights off, then.

132
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,822
- Good night. - Sleep tight.

133
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,692
- Yes. - Good night.

134
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:08,903
Good night.

135
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:10,903
I permit you to dream of me.

136
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,462
Thank you for your permission.

137
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,832
Shall I take a trip to Ms. Kim's dreams tonight?

138
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,192
That's the vice chairman's car.

139
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,432
Where are you going, Mr. Lee?

140
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,533
A buyer from a company that launched in France...

141
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:09,832
has just landed in Korea.

142
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,832
They haven't launched here yet, so I've scheduled a meeting...

143
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:13,803
to try and get an exclusive contract with them.

144
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:15,273
What?

145
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:17,442
How do you have something on your schedule that I don't know about?

146
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,873
I received an urgent call from Yoo Shik about it yesterday.

147
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:23,842
Then you should've also told me about it.

148
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,212
At any rate, I'll get ready as quickly as I can and come to you.

149
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:28,023
No, this is my job.

150
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:29,182
Pardon?

151
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:30,753
And your job...

152
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,523
is to enjoy the rest of the workshop.

153
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,352
Take this chance to really unwind.

154
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,163
That'll be all.

155
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:49,102
If you feel that bad about it,

156
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:50,243
come and hang out at my place later.

157
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:52,913
(If you feel that bad about it)

158
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:56,712
(come and hang out at my place later)

159
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:58,253
An amazing gift will be awaiting you.

160
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,982
Aren't you looking forward to it?

161
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:04,082
What are you doing, Ms. Kim?

162
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,192
What kind of text has made you so bashful like this?

163
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:10,293
Did someone ask you out on a date, by any chance?

164
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:13,862
No, not at all. I just got an ad from a grocery store...

165
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:16,533
saying that shrimp from Chile are on sale now.

166
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:18,972
I should go buy some shrimp.

167
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:34,952
Come on, what's the hold up?

168
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:36,753
I apologize.

169
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:39,523
I'm just following the speed limit.

170
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:44,222
I see. You're doing a fine job.

171
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:52,533
Yes, I'll have high hopes when I come by.

172
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:04,112
It's just so early that...

173
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:17,592
We look forward to having a long-term business partnership

174
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,092
with a major company.

175
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:20,832
You will not regret choosing us.

176
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,533
- Thank you. - It's my pleasure.

177
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,403
- Bye. - Bye.

178
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:37,342
We pulled off something which nobody didn't get to.

179
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:39,852
There's nothing I can't do when I put my mind to it.

180
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,192
- I respect you, sir. - Good.

181
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:48,862
You've got some time?

182
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:52,293
I have plenty of time. Why do you ask?

183
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:55,062
- Let's go grocery shopping. - Grocery shopping?

184
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,403
I plan to have some barbecue in the garden.

185
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:00,773
- Barbecue? - Yes.

186
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:07,072
Let's buy all parts of beef and pork.

187
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:08,812
You, be in charge of pork.

188
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,253
Is tenderloin good today?

189
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,623
Should I buy some tenderloin? Gosh, I'm relieved.

190
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,663
If you try sausages grilled with charcoal,

191
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:27,462
you won't crave pan-fried sausages at all.

192
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:28,663
They're totally different.

193
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,972
Let's buy potatoes and sweet potatoes too.

194
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:36,202
The moment they jump into the charcoal fire...

195
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:38,873
They are hardy plants for a reason.

196
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,743
They are just delicious.

197
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:43,842
Let's go.

198
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:48,023
We've bought the best ingredients.

199
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,722
And you have me, the best chef.

200
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:52,993
The food will be fantastic.

201
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:55,493
Oh, right.

202
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,793
We should've bought some more vegetables.

203
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,202
Thanks for helping me today.

204
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:09,903
I'll see you at the company tomorrow.

205
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:12,842
I thought I was part of it.

206
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:15,842
Hey, hey. Are you saying that you used me?

207
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,243
Hey!

208
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:19,783
You're being very mean right now.

209
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:33,232
- Good job. - Good job, guys.

210
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:35,263
I feel too bad to say goodbye here.

211
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,133
How about we have pork back-bone stew with soju?

212
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:40,033
I'd like to, but I have to go return the car.

213
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:41,342
See you tomorrow.

214
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,472
- Bye. - I can't either.

215
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,643
It's better for me to look into more documents than drinking soju.

216
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,212
Then, goodbye.

217
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:51,212
What about you?

218
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:52,883
I have an appointment too.

219
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,082
I'm sorry. See you tomorrow.

220
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:56,053
- Bye. - Goodbye.

221
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:59,793
Ms. Kim seems very suspicious since a while ago.

222
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:00,893
It's like...

223
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:03,722
she's going on a date or something.

224
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:04,832
No way.

225
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:07,332
You know she's never dated anyone in her life.

226
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,903
She has no time to date anyone...

227
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:11,832
because she's too busy working for the vice chairman.

228
00:15:12,072 --> 00:15:13,133
Gosh.

229
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:15,673
By any chance, is she going...

230
00:15:18,612 --> 00:15:19,972
to work with the vice chairman again?

231
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:21,612
Without having her weekend?

232
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:23,982
Is that right?

233
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:27,153
This is your future, Ji Ah.

234
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:30,822
Once Ms. Kim resigns, you'll have to work like her.

235
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:32,092
Really?

236
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:36,123
Let's continue talking about her future...

237
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:37,932
with a glass of soju at a pork back-bone stew place.

238
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:40,692
- Goodbye. - Bye.

239
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:45,533
Go with me.

240
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,883
It's nothing special, so I shouldn't dress up too much.

241
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:50,102
Is it too much?

242
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,003
I wore jeans when we went to the amusement part.

243
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:56,803
Is it too much like wedding?

244
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:12,122
Good. This looks enough.

245
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:15,523
Hardworking Cow, what do you think?

246
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:17,763
Gosh.

247
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,433
I'm sorry.

248
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:22,562
Was it suffocating?

249
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:26,372
I'm running late, so I'll clean the mess later.

250
00:17:57,362 --> 00:17:58,473
Gosh, mosquitoes.

251
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:08,483
Sir.

252
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:37,912
You're pretty today.

253
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,842
Thank you.

254
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:44,852
What are all these by the way?

255
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,783
You said you wanted to have meat grilled with charcoal fire...

256
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:49,283
and that it'd taste better outside.

257
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:50,753
That's why I prepared these.

258
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:55,562
See? The amazing gift was waiting for you.

259
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:58,162
Right. It's really amazing.

260
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:13,312
I think you have to flip it now.

261
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:23,122
Oh, dear.

262
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:27,493
It's okay. You can grill a new piece again.

263
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:29,223
- There's no more left. - What?

264
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,463
Did you burn them all?

265
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:37,402
I've never grilled meat before.

266
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,832
I guess there's one thing which I'm bad at.

267
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:42,072
What do you think? Aren't I humane?

268
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:46,943
Right.

269
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,112
What should we do?

270
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:53,553
If you're not too hungry, shall I go buy some more meat?

271
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:55,852
- I'll grill them again. - No.

272
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,322
No, thanks.

273
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,602
Are you mad?

274
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,703
(Pizza)

275
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:20,243
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.

276
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:29,023
It would've been nicer if we'd had meat grilled with charcoal fire.

277
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,723
I'm all right with pizza. Go ahead and eat.

278
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:43,803
Thank you.

279
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:58,683
Ms. Kim.

280
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:00,882
There's something stuck here on your face.

281
00:21:01,922 --> 00:21:02,953
Gosh.

282
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:05,892
Here?

283
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:07,352
- No, not there. - Well...

284
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:10,322
No.

285
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,433
Go with me.

286
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:49,503
I don't want to go alone.

287
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:52,602
- Let's go together. - No!

288
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:07,283
Which way will you push me this time?

289
00:22:07,513 --> 00:22:08,882
Let me brace myself beforehand.

290
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:11,193
This way? That way?

291
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:13,453
Ms. Kim.

292
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:15,822
You know...

293
00:22:15,822 --> 00:22:18,132
Young Joon, what on earth are you doing after leaving me behind?

294
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:34,513
You guys were really doing something.

295
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:37,443
Well... I...

296
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:40,483
I brought this drink with me because I thought it'd go well with meat.

297
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:42,723
In fact, I'm the one who doesn't belong here.

298
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:45,293
I'll leave you alone. Keep doing what you've been doing.

299
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:48,763
No, I'll go out. I was about to head out anyway.

300
00:22:50,062 --> 00:22:51,092
No.

301
00:23:10,783 --> 00:23:11,983
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:15,352
I've made a huge mistake just now.

303
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:33,733
It's embarrassing. Why did he have to come in at that timing?

304
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:48,822
I'm sure there's something.

305
00:24:01,902 --> 00:24:04,402
Ms. Kim. Wait for me.

306
00:24:19,852 --> 00:24:21,283
I'm sorry about yesterday.

307
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:24,082
I had no idea that you two would be together.

308
00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:25,753
I didn't interrupt you, did I?

309
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:27,553
Of course, not.

310
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:30,493
There was nothing to interrupt going on.

311
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:33,463
I'm not sure what you're thinking,

312
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:35,803
- but nothing happened. - Aren't you getting off?

313
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:50,142
It's quite late to tell you this, but Young Joon prepared a lot for...

314
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:52,582
Are you okay?

315
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:56,152
Fortunately, I didn't sprain it.

316
00:24:56,152 --> 00:24:58,493
Is it because of my new calcium supplement?

317
00:25:01,162 --> 00:25:02,223
It does feel different.

318
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:08,303
By the way, have you seen...

319
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,332
the vice chairman's scar on his ankles?

320
00:25:12,203 --> 00:25:13,803
Have you seen them too?

321
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:15,642
Yes.

322
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,142
Do you know how he got those scar?

323
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:22,013
I've only seen them once. That's all.

324
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,553
When we played football together during our times of studying abroad,

325
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:26,983
he always changed clothes alone.

326
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:28,453
- See you. - Bye.

327
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:31,592
I was on my way out,

328
00:25:31,592 --> 00:25:33,023
and he was getting changed alone in the room.

329
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:37,122
Though it was a quick moment, I vividly saw...

330
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:40,362
the clear scars on his both ankles.

331
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:44,102
Both ankles?

332
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:46,572
They seemed quite old.

333
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:49,642
It was more like his ankles were tied to something.

334
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:51,872
You know about people's feelings.

335
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:53,642
I suddenly came to have such thought.

336
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:56,183
Can a simple tied trace...

337
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:58,713
be left as a scar like that?

338
00:25:59,213 --> 00:26:02,783
I've seen an abandoned puppy with a thin leash on his neck...

339
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:06,422
in some kind of an animal protection program before.

340
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:11,132
He wandered around for quite a long time with that leash on.

341
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:13,463
He didn't have enough blood circulation. His neck got swollen.

342
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,062
The iron leash eventually dug into his flesh.

343
00:26:16,402 --> 00:26:17,433
That's enough.

344
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:19,172
I'm sorry.

345
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:24,203
I don't know how he got his scars,

346
00:26:24,912 --> 00:26:27,572
but his personality wouldn't allow him to tell the story to others.

347
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,783
It was a bit awkward to ask him too.

348
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:36,253
Speaking of which,

349
00:26:36,852 --> 00:26:38,892
when you talked about the abduction...

350
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:40,922
that happened when you were little,

351
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:45,193
I wondered if those scars...

352
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:47,392
had something to do with it.

353
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:49,733
But you said it was his brother, not him.

354
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:56,172
Then how on earth did he get...

355
00:26:56,672 --> 00:26:57,842
those scars?

356
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:06,382
The vice chairman's scars.

357
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:09,322
I thought he had it only on one of his ankles.

358
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:13,622
Like Mr. Park said, did he get them from being tied?

359
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:18,392
Those scars aren't easy to be made though.

360
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:26,433
You're here, sir.

361
00:27:45,223 --> 00:27:46,422
What's up with her face expression?

362
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:50,562
Is it because we couldn't kiss each other yesterday either?

363
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:53,963
It's not that I don't want to.

364
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,062
I want to do it too.

365
00:27:58,273 --> 00:27:59,973
What do you want to do, sir?

366
00:27:59,973 --> 00:28:02,703
I want to do a meeting.

367
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:06,142
Oh, Ji Ah.

368
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:10,043
Can you tell Mr. Jung to come in for the weekly briefing?

369
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:11,513
Okay.

370
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:16,553
Focus.

371
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,293
- Here. - Thank you.

372
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:29,102
This is delicious.

373
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,533
It's melting in my mouth.

374
00:28:31,703 --> 00:28:35,243
They look very fancy. Did you prepare them yourself?

375
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:38,273
No. Mr. Park got them as a gift,

376
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:39,743
but he told me to have them.

377
00:28:41,382 --> 00:28:43,112
Where did Ms. Bong go?

378
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:45,652
She'll take care of her business outside and come in late.

379
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:48,723
I should put some aside for her then.

380
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:52,092
Three for Ms. Bong.

381
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,223
Don't you think it's so cheap of you?

382
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:56,862
You gave us two each.

383
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,993
Why does she get three?

384
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:02,003
You know, I like her.

385
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,473
She's cute and charismatic.

386
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:09,872
- Mr. Jung. - Yes?

387
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:12,342
The vice chairman wants you to go in for the weekly briefing.

388
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:14,412
Oh, no.

389
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,953
I do it every week, but I still can't get used to this.

390
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:24,122
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

391
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:27,293
- You can do it. - See you later.

392
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:34,562
This is the schedule for the next month's opening of...

393
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:36,662
Yumyung Department Store Dongseongno branch in Daegu.

394
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:39,332
This is the article which will be released...

395
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:41,342
after the opening ceremony of the Art Center tomorrow afternoon.

396
00:29:42,602 --> 00:29:46,013
And it's the draft of the upcoming festival in Yumyung Land,

397
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:49,882
designed by the promotion team.

398
00:29:57,723 --> 00:29:59,592
Having "Romantic Night"...

399
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:01,562
as the theme, they included...

400
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:05,092
the image of a kissing couple in the amusement park in the poster.

401
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:18,112
I'm sorry. I'll have them design it again.

402
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,912
No, it's okay. Proceed with this concept.

403
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:22,243
No.

404
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:24,852
I'll come back with an upgraded version.

405
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:26,683
Have a nice day.

406
00:30:43,362 --> 00:30:47,033
Right, it must be hard to understand in her circumstance.

407
00:30:48,743 --> 00:30:50,602
How should I explain?

408
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:55,513
I'm here.

409
00:30:55,642 --> 00:30:57,043
- You're here. - Good work.

410
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:59,382
- Good work. - Good work.

411
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,652
Gosh, I wish tomorrow comes quickly.

412
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,023
There are just too many things to check for the ceremony.

413
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:07,122
The Art Center has to open quickly so that I can relax a little.

414
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:10,463
What are these?

415
00:31:10,993 --> 00:31:13,793
Someone who likes you left them there for you.

416
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:16,503
- Someone who likes me? - Yes.

417
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:35,352
A bug came in my clothes.

418
00:31:56,503 --> 00:31:59,543
Mr. Yang, thank you.

419
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,943
(Send)

420
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:13,023
Ms. Bong. Here's the data which you've asked for.

421
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,463
Are you having those macaroons?

422
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:16,693
Yes.

423
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:19,533
I'm having because they've been given to me, but it's a bit awkward.

424
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:23,102
I mean, he should've told me privately first.

425
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:24,803
Why did he make it so public?

426
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:26,102
I don't know what to do now.

427
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:32,593
What do you mean? A junior colleague...

428
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:33,923
just wanted to express her respect.

429
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:36,823
- A junior colleague? - Yes.

430
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:38,962
That's from Ms. Seol.

431
00:32:39,563 --> 00:32:41,202
- What did you just say? - Oh, no.

432
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:43,762
Were you thinking...

433
00:32:44,403 --> 00:32:47,972
that some guy might have a crush on you?

434
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:53,712
No.

435
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:55,813
I never thought that.

436
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,683
My goodness.

437
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,472
- Ms. Bong. - Yes?

438
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:24,772
What's this message about?

439
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,012
What were you thanking me for?

440
00:33:28,512 --> 00:33:31,153
I was just saying I'm grateful that I can eat three meals a day.

441
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,383
I can't even express my gratitude?

442
00:33:42,423 --> 00:33:43,623
What's she saying?

443
00:33:48,202 --> 00:33:50,262
Then why did he pick up my bra pad for me that day?

444
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:52,433
Because of what he did,

445
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,373
I've lost my peace of mind.

446
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,942
I like cute women.

447
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:08,522
So he likes the cute type.

448
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:19,293
Which way will you push me this time?

449
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:21,103
I want to be ready.

450
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:32,313
Ms. Kim,

451
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:35,043
I promise I'll give you a sweet kiss next time.

452
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:37,413
(Ms. Kim, I promise I'll give you a sweet kiss next time)

453
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:40,512
(A sweet kiss next time)

454
00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:50,092
Ms. Kim, I'm actually traumatized by...

455
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,293
(I'm actually traumatized by...)

456
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:55,003
No, no!

457
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:07,882
Ji Ah.

458
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:10,043
This is the prize for the winner...

459
00:35:10,043 --> 00:35:11,583
of the treasure hunt at the workshop.

460
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,052
I heard that you and Mr. Ko won.

461
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:15,552
This is amazing.

462
00:35:15,683 --> 00:35:17,253
There really is a prize.

463
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:18,452
Of course.

464
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:21,592
Please make sure Mr. Ko gets his prize too.

465
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,463
- You want me to give it to him? - Yes.

466
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:27,632
Okay.

467
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:29,433
I'll be right back.

468
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:41,457

469
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:51,052
Do you need something, sir?

470
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:57,733
Well...

471
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:06,532
I'm going to eat this.

472
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:07,702
My blood sugar just hit rock bottom.

473
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:09,902
That was...

474
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:11,972
the last piece.

475
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:17,443
So what?

476
00:36:18,353 --> 00:36:19,353
Pardon me?

477
00:36:22,422 --> 00:36:23,422
Never mind, sir.

478
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:36,702
I'll overcome it.

479
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:42,443
I, Lee Young Joon, can overcome anything.

480
00:36:55,538 --> 00:36:56,538
Here you go.

481
00:36:56,978 --> 00:36:59,647
It's the prize for the treasure hunt winner.

482
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:04,248
Ms. Kim,

483
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:06,317
you must be very grateful to me.

484
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:07,857
Sorry? Why would I be?

485
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:10,788
What do you think? You know that we could win the game...

486
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:14,158
because we managed to find 3 out of the 5 ribbons, right?

487
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:16,598
- Yes, I do know that. - Out of the three,

488
00:37:16,598 --> 00:37:17,667
I found two,

489
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,967
and you only found one. You know that too, right?

490
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:21,638
Yes, of course.

491
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:24,268
I found 2, and you only found 1.

492
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:27,408
Do you really think that we both deserve a tablet computer?

493
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,877
- What? - I looked up its price online,

494
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:32,647
and the lowest I could find was 799 dollars.

495
00:37:32,647 --> 00:37:35,377
That means 2 of them are worth 1598 dollars.

496
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:36,518
Thus it's only fair...

497
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:39,717
that we split that amount 2 to 1,

498
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:42,257
but I'm not complaining about it because I'm a gentleman,

499
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:44,087
so you should definitely be grateful.

500
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:46,828
- What? - Anyway,

501
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,058
You left me on the tree and ran away during the game,

502
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,598
but I let it slide.

503
00:37:50,598 --> 00:37:52,397
Plus, I even got you this tablet,

504
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:55,868
so you'd better take my secret to your grave.

505
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:56,938
You got that?

506
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:03,308
Why are you talking about my grave? I'm not dying anytime soon.

507
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:06,107
Whatever.

508
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:08,248
I have to get back to work.

509
00:38:09,447 --> 00:38:10,678
Goodbye.

510
00:38:14,388 --> 00:38:16,417
By the way, when are you moving in?

511
00:38:16,618 --> 00:38:18,058
In a few days. Why do you ask?

512
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:19,788
That's great.

513
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,158
When you order food, you'll always have leftovers...

514
00:38:23,158 --> 00:38:25,428
because it's usually too much food for just one person.

515
00:38:25,897 --> 00:38:27,598
I hope you're not suggesting eating together.

516
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:28,897
Of course not.

517
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:31,268
Whenever you order food,

518
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,667
you should give me half of it before you start eating.

519
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:36,178
Then you won't have any food waste, so it'll benefit both of us.

520
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:37,947
See you.

521
00:38:39,478 --> 00:38:41,178
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

522
00:38:41,678 --> 00:38:43,518
How can he be so confident?

523
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:49,487
I shouldn't move there.

524
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:55,027
- Oh, boy. - Look at this.

525
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:03,438
Ms. Bong.

526
00:39:04,098 --> 00:39:06,368
What's up with that hairdo?

527
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:08,507
Well, you know.

528
00:39:09,277 --> 00:39:11,447
I didn't think that the hairstyle I had earlier...

529
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:14,147
really suit Se Ra,

530
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,178
so I changed it up a little...

531
00:39:17,578 --> 00:39:19,288
so that I can flaunt my cute charm.

532
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,757
Did you say "cute"?

533
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:24,857
Not "pathetic"?

534
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:25,857
What did you just say?

535
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:29,428
Don't be like that.

536
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:32,598
If you keep teasing me like that,

537
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:33,967
Se Ra will get mad at you.

538
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:38,868
I must say, that hairstyle looks so familiar.

539
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:41,507
Yes, my mother!

540
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,808
She had her hair like that in her graduation photo.

541
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:45,678
Oh, you're right.

542
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:47,348
What's that movie with Kwon Sang Woo...

543
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:48,817
staged in the 70s?

544
00:39:49,877 --> 00:39:52,217
"Once Upon a Time in High School". Han Ga In's hair looked like that.

545
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,518
"Once Upon a Time in High School"?

546
00:39:56,158 --> 00:39:57,728
Hey, you're...

547
00:39:57,788 --> 00:39:59,958
My goodness, you're really something.

548
00:40:05,598 --> 00:40:06,667
My gosh.

549
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:08,967
Mr. Yang is always so quiet,

550
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:10,268
and he rarely laughs.

551
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:12,167
What I just said must've really resonated with him.

552
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,308
Aren't I right, Mr. Yang?

553
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:14,978
Isn't she a real piece of work?

554
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:17,237
Shall I teach you a lesson?

555
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:26,388
I'll forgive you because I'm cute.

556
00:40:27,688 --> 00:40:30,357
Cute, my foot. Hey, you can laugh out loud.

557
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:38,828
What's wrong with me? Why can't I get him out of my head?

558
00:40:39,297 --> 00:40:41,737
He just picked up my bra pad for me, and it's not a big deal.

559
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:45,607
Forget it. From now on, I won't care about what he says or does.

560
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:47,978
He's not even my type anyway.

561
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:07,728
(My dad got me caramels today.)

562
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:09,397
(Come visit me. You haven't forgotten about me, right?)

563
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:24,947
Son, you sure are a writer.

564
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,808
Are you going to spend the whole day in your study?

565
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:29,018
What book got you totally immersed in its world these days?

566
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:30,877
I was reading a diary, not a book.

567
00:41:31,717 --> 00:41:33,688
- A diary? - Yes.

568
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:37,417
It's written by the girl I met when I was kidnapped.

569
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:39,527
What?

570
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:42,697
I wasn't the only one there. She was there with me.

571
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:45,598
And the two of us...

572
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:47,567
somehow escaped that dismal place together.

573
00:41:49,368 --> 00:41:50,498
What...

574
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:52,607
What are you talking about?

575
00:41:53,237 --> 00:41:56,638
What I'm saying is, I wasn't the only one who was locked up in there.

576
00:41:57,178 --> 00:42:00,047
That girl was kidnapped by that woman as well.

577
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:05,587
That can't be.

578
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:09,917
You came to the police station alone at the break of dawn that day.

579
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:12,058
Apparently, I walked her home before I went to the police station.

580
00:42:12,928 --> 00:42:16,257
After all, I wasn't alone in that scary, dark place.

581
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:18,228
Thank goodness.

582
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,797
I find it hard to believe.

583
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:26,208
I'm getting a bad feeling for some reason.

584
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:29,078
I don't know who told you that, but don't believe everything.

585
00:42:32,478 --> 00:42:34,248
Don't you want to know who the girl is?

586
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:36,178
It's someone you know.

587
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,788
What?

588
00:42:39,987 --> 00:42:41,118
It's Mi So.

589
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:43,388
Kim Mi So.

590
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:58,538
I'll overcome it.

591
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:02,507
I, Lee Young Joon, can overcome anything.

592
00:43:04,237 --> 00:43:05,578
Overcome what?

593
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:08,917
What happened to Mr. Lee in the past?

594
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:17,587
Hello, ma'am. How have you been?

595
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:21,498
Oh, Mr. Lee is in a meeting at the moment.

596
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:22,828
I see. Ms. Kim,

597
00:43:23,627 --> 00:43:26,768
would you have time to meet with me today?

598
00:43:28,197 --> 00:43:29,297
Pardon me?

599
00:43:29,297 --> 00:43:30,967
I'll let Young Joon know.

600
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:33,567
Okay.

601
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:37,078
Ms. Kim.

602
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,377
I know how busy you are.

603
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,678
I'm sorry for taking up your time like this.

604
00:43:42,377 --> 00:43:43,618
It's okay, ma'am.

605
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:47,658
Sung Yeon told me everything.

606
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:51,188
He said you were there with him...

607
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:54,428
when you were both young.

608
00:43:55,357 --> 00:43:56,498
Is it really true?

609
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:00,297
Yes, ma'am. It's true.

610
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:04,098
I was very young back then, so I wasn't too sure,

611
00:44:05,138 --> 00:44:07,538
but I happened to read what he wrote and realized it was him.

612
00:44:09,138 --> 00:44:10,237
Be more specific.

613
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,007
I want to know the details.

614
00:44:14,178 --> 00:44:16,447
Can you tell me more about what happened?

615
00:44:22,987 --> 00:44:24,058
It was a tiny room,

616
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,888
and it was very cold in there.

617
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:30,797
When I got there,

618
00:44:31,328 --> 00:44:33,567
I saw a boy, who seemed to have been kidnapped before me,

619
00:44:34,127 --> 00:44:36,397
sitting in a corner of the room.

620
00:44:37,837 --> 00:44:39,507
I don't remember exactly what happened,

621
00:44:40,337 --> 00:44:43,078
but he got mad at me and called me dumb as soon as he saw me.

622
00:44:43,408 --> 00:44:44,777
You're dumb, aren't you?

623
00:44:44,777 --> 00:44:46,007
No, I'm not dumb.

624
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:47,877
I'm only five,

625
00:44:47,877 --> 00:44:50,518
but I can read books better than my older sister, Mal Hee, does.

626
00:44:52,388 --> 00:44:55,788
I think he felt bad for me because I was kidnapped like he was.

627
00:44:57,217 --> 00:44:58,328
And...

628
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:02,328
he tried to make me feel better because I was scared.

629
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:14,138
Ma'am.

630
00:45:17,978 --> 00:45:19,908
It's okay. I'm fine.

631
00:45:21,078 --> 00:45:22,178
Go on.

632
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:25,087
What was it like in there?

633
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,587
Was Hyun okay?

634
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,498
From what I remember, he seemed okay.

635
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:45,208
He walked me home after we escaped that house.

636
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:48,308
He even promised me that we'd meet again.

637
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:52,107
In my memories,

638
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,178
he was a brave and considerate boy...

639
00:45:55,817 --> 00:45:58,587
who did his best to protect me.

640
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:01,658
Did he get very cold in there?

641
00:46:02,788 --> 00:46:04,558
He gets cold easily.

642
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:11,397
He was wearing a sky blue shirt and some sort of a jacket.

643
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:13,627
No, it wasn't a jacket.

644
00:46:15,197 --> 00:46:16,397
It was a cardigan.

645
00:46:17,768 --> 00:46:21,277
The fashion designer, Jang Jung Do,

646
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:24,107
made that cardigan for him.

647
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:29,047
I may be biased because he's my son, but it looked amazing on him.

648
00:46:30,817 --> 00:46:31,888
That day,

649
00:46:32,647 --> 00:46:36,188
I watched him leaving home in it and thought he looked so adorable.

650
00:46:42,397 --> 00:46:44,667
Had I made him put on a thicker jacket,

651
00:46:45,868 --> 00:46:47,297
he wouldn't have been cold at least.

652
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:50,598
That thought...

653
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:56,007
made me beat myself up throughout the four days that he was missing.

654
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,447
Ma'am.

655
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:05,388
Ever since that incident,

656
00:47:07,788 --> 00:47:11,388
every day has been like torture for my family.

657
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:15,397
Whenever my two boys were in the same room,

658
00:47:16,397 --> 00:47:18,627
Sung Yeon attacked Young Joon.

659
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:23,138
And Young Joon didn't know how to deal with it.

660
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:26,107
It was hard to watch.

661
00:47:29,038 --> 00:47:30,408
Ma'am.

662
00:47:32,507 --> 00:47:34,377
I'm not sure if I can ask you this,

663
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:38,047
but I heard that Mr. Lee lost all of his childhood memories.

664
00:47:39,087 --> 00:47:40,618
May I ask what happened?

665
00:47:44,257 --> 00:47:46,828
Like I said, every day was like torture for us. Then one day,

666
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,498
Young Joon fainted...

667
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,067
in the middle of breakfast.

668
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:56,538
When he regained his consciousness,

669
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:58,808
he couldn't remember a thing.

670
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:01,877
I really don't remember anything.

671
00:48:02,438 --> 00:48:03,737
I'm sorry.

672
00:48:05,478 --> 00:48:06,678
And...

673
00:48:07,848 --> 00:48:09,118
only after that,

674
00:48:09,817 --> 00:48:11,987
my family could go back to being somewhat normal again...

675
00:48:12,647 --> 00:48:14,888
even though things were still messed up under the surface.

676
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:21,627
But the thing is... Mi So.

677
00:48:22,828 --> 00:48:23,998
I heard Mi So is here.

678
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:26,868
You're really here.

679
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:30,268
You should've called me.

680
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,938
Well, this is...

681
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:35,078
You should stay for dinner.

682
00:48:36,277 --> 00:48:38,308
I can't. I'm a bit swamped at work today.

683
00:48:39,277 --> 00:48:40,348
Really?

684
00:48:41,748 --> 00:48:44,217
Then I'll see you out. Hold on a minute, okay?

685
00:48:44,217 --> 00:48:45,388
I'll go get changed.

686
00:48:54,797 --> 00:48:55,998
Anyway,

687
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:58,697
what I wanted to...

688
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:02,098
tell you the most was...

689
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:04,908
that I thank you...

690
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:08,837
for being by his side that day.

691
00:49:10,107 --> 00:49:11,208
That's all.

692
00:49:22,717 --> 00:49:23,888
Finally, it's tomorrow.

693
00:49:27,158 --> 00:49:28,428
The book concert.

694
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,598
At first, I regretted agreeing to it and got a bit anxious,

695
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:33,998
but I think I made the right decision.

696
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,967
I think it'll be fun, and we could meet again like this...

697
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:38,268
thanks to it.

698
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:43,408
By the way, the sun is very strong today.

699
00:49:44,408 --> 00:49:45,947
I hope the summer ends soon.

700
00:49:46,107 --> 00:49:47,248
I like winter.

701
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,578
Winter?

702
00:49:50,147 --> 00:49:51,817
But you get cold easily.

703
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:55,817
No, I don't get cold that easily.

704
00:50:03,897 --> 00:50:07,667
Ms. Choi said that he gets cold easily.

705
00:50:08,337 --> 00:50:09,967
But he actually doesn't get cold easily?

706
00:50:10,868 --> 00:50:12,638
What if we catch a cold?

707
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:15,478
- I'm fine, sir. - I'm worried about myself, not you.

708
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:17,178
I don't want to catch a cold.

709
00:50:18,777 --> 00:50:20,047
Right, you get cold easily.

710
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:24,388
Could he be...

711
00:50:28,388 --> 00:50:30,958
What am I thinking? That can't be.

712
00:50:52,947 --> 00:50:55,447
(To my sweetheart)

713
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:08,558
My dad got me caramels today.

714
00:51:09,098 --> 00:51:11,297
I saved you many pieces.

715
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:14,337
My sisters tried to eat them all,

716
00:51:14,598 --> 00:51:16,667
but I made sure they couldn't come anywhere near them.

717
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,417
This is my house.

718
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:31,147
It is really near.

719
00:51:31,248 --> 00:51:33,288
By the way, you know,

720
00:51:33,288 --> 00:51:35,518
I want to marry you.

721
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:38,228
Marry me?

722
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,027
Promise me.

723
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:44,368
- I can't. - Why can't you?

724
00:51:45,627 --> 00:51:48,737
You are supposed to marry someone you love when you grow up.

725
00:51:49,498 --> 00:51:52,237
Then you can love me...

726
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:53,908
when you grow up.

727
00:51:57,277 --> 00:51:59,007
Okay, then. Let's get married.

728
00:52:00,107 --> 00:52:01,678
Promise me.

729
00:52:01,947 --> 00:52:04,647
I will come back to see you.

730
00:52:17,197 --> 00:52:18,467
Don't touch that.

731
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:22,667
It's really precious to me.

732
00:52:43,018 --> 00:52:44,018
Thank you.

733
00:52:47,558 --> 00:52:49,197
Thanks to you, I reunited with Mi So.

734
00:52:50,058 --> 00:52:53,467
Because you abandoned me there that day...

735
00:52:54,897 --> 00:52:57,808
and because you hired Mi So as your secretary.

736
00:53:01,237 --> 00:53:03,178
You made everything happen.

737
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,107
I sincerely appreciate it.

738
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:16,217
All right. Don't stop thanking me.

739
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:21,998
Thanks to me, you will be able to keep seeing Mi So.

740
00:53:23,598 --> 00:53:25,697
Mi So will always be beside me.

741
00:53:32,438 --> 00:53:33,667
Well.

742
00:53:34,607 --> 00:53:38,377
We will have to wait and see who she will be with.

743
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,348
You're home, Young Joon.

744
00:53:48,587 --> 00:53:51,527
I heard you called for Ms. Kim. I thought she might still be here.

745
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:56,357
Mother,

746
00:53:58,098 --> 00:54:01,038
I hope you won't call for her again.

747
00:54:01,868 --> 00:54:02,897
What?

748
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,978
Ms. Kim is really busy.

749
00:54:09,478 --> 00:54:11,748
I will see you at the opening ceremony tomorrow.

750
00:54:28,257 --> 00:54:31,098
Why are you so serious? You didn't even drink.

751
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:34,067
Is it because of Ms. Kim?

752
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:39,337
No.

753
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,078
Something happened between you two, right?

754
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:47,618
Listen carefully, buddy.

755
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:50,777
I think dating someone is...

756
00:54:50,777 --> 00:54:53,388
looking at each other naked.

757
00:54:55,118 --> 00:54:57,487
- You are perverted. - That's not it.

758
00:54:58,627 --> 00:55:01,498
I mean you should be completely honest with each other.

759
00:55:01,627 --> 00:55:04,428
Let's say you decided to take off your clothes at the same time.

760
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,067
She took off all her clothes.

761
00:55:07,598 --> 00:55:09,467
But you are still wearing a piece of underwear.

762
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:12,208
How embarrassed would she be?

763
00:55:14,138 --> 00:55:17,478
Even if it's embarrassing, I took off all my clothes. But you...

764
00:55:19,078 --> 00:55:22,277
Why didn't he take off his clothes? She would feel betrayed.

765
00:55:25,618 --> 00:55:26,688
So?

766
00:55:26,788 --> 00:55:28,757
You should take off...

767
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:30,917
the underwear in your mind.

768
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:32,987
What?

769
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:36,357
You are hiding something from Ms. Kim, aren't you?

770
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,297
I don't know what you are talking about.

771
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:43,638
You see, ever since my wife caught me lying...

772
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:46,308
in the beginning of our relationship,

773
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:49,138
I didn't hide anything from her. Why?

774
00:55:49,538 --> 00:55:52,848
Even if you hide it, a lie only gets bigger with time.

775
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:56,078
In the end, it jeopardizes your relationship.

776
00:55:56,277 --> 00:55:57,547
I experienced that myself.

777
00:56:01,587 --> 00:56:02,987
What was the lie?

778
00:56:03,717 --> 00:56:05,328
I told her that she was my first lady.

779
00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:10,527
But on our wedding night, she figured out that it was a lie.

780
00:56:10,527 --> 00:56:12,828
I went on for too long,

781
00:56:12,928 --> 00:56:14,498
but what I essentially want to say is this.

782
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:18,808
If you are hiding something from her,

783
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:22,308
you should tell her everything before you start dating.

784
00:56:22,308 --> 00:56:25,348
Even if that underwear feels like it's part of you...

785
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,777
because you had it on for such a long time.

786
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,587
It's not as simple as that.

787
00:56:38,627 --> 00:56:39,788
There are truths...

788
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:42,328
that are too painful to know.

789
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:57,978
I am scared.

790
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,618
No, Mi So. It's just a spider.

791
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:04,987
No!

792
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:25,708
What is this dream?

793
00:57:26,368 --> 00:57:29,938
I thought I'd remember everything when I meet the boy.

794
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,578
It's getting more and more confusing.

795
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:42,888
Are you asleep?

796
00:57:42,888 --> 00:57:46,027
(Are you asleep?)

797
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,697
I woke up just now.

798
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,058
(I woke up just now)

799
00:57:49,058 --> 00:57:51,697
I see. I saw the light suddenly turning on.

800
00:58:37,105 --> 00:58:38,304
What is this?

801
00:58:40,105 --> 00:58:41,174
Open it.

802
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,625
It's an apology for eating the caramel.

803
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:57,824
And...

804
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:03,194
I wanted to see you too.

805
00:59:10,165 --> 00:59:11,335
You should go in now.

806
00:59:14,105 --> 00:59:15,344
Sweet dreams.

807
00:59:58,554 --> 00:59:59,984
It's really strange.

808
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:04,795
Why do I keep feeling like crying?

809
01:00:39,895 --> 01:00:41,495
Yumyung Art Hall...

810
01:00:41,924 --> 01:00:44,025
will contribute to quenching the citizens' thirst for culture...

811
01:00:44,264 --> 01:00:47,295
and increasing the quality of their lives.

812
01:00:47,764 --> 01:00:48,804
Thank you.

813
01:00:57,674 --> 01:01:00,214
("Once in a Lifetime")

814
01:01:02,085 --> 01:01:03,745
Did everything go well during the rehearsal?

815
01:01:03,745 --> 01:01:05,114
Audio, video, and lighting...

816
01:01:05,114 --> 01:01:06,614
are all perfectly set-up.

817
01:01:06,614 --> 01:01:09,324
When the journalists arrive, please check if they are on the list.

818
01:01:09,324 --> 01:01:10,924
I will thoroughly check.

819
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:12,895
Don't loosen your guard until the end of the event.

820
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:14,094
Please do a good job.

821
01:01:14,094 --> 01:01:15,194
I will.

822
01:01:17,395 --> 01:01:19,694
("Once in a Lifetime")

823
01:01:24,734 --> 01:01:25,935
Well done, Ms. Kim.

824
01:01:28,545 --> 01:01:30,944
You planned and...

825
01:01:30,944 --> 01:01:32,174
coordinated everything for this book concert.

826
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:35,714
You did a good job.

827
01:01:37,145 --> 01:01:38,185
Thank you.

828
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:53,795
Mr. Lee, the waiting room is over there.

829
01:01:53,935 --> 01:01:54,964
Okay.

830
01:02:09,915 --> 01:02:11,185
Did you look for me?

831
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,685
Do you have time?

832
01:02:13,784 --> 01:02:15,384
Yes. What is it?

833
01:02:15,884 --> 01:02:18,225
I wondered if you could go over my lecture script.

834
01:02:18,855 --> 01:02:21,065
Thinking about speaking in front of people...

835
01:02:21,065 --> 01:02:22,194
makes me a little nervous.

836
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:23,895
Can you help me?

837
01:02:26,295 --> 01:02:28,005
Yes. If I can help.

838
01:02:43,245 --> 01:02:44,284
It's nice.

839
01:02:44,614 --> 01:02:46,284
They will get to know about your values, thoughts,

840
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:48,755
and sentimentality. I bet they will have a great time.

841
01:02:49,384 --> 01:02:50,384
Do you think so?

842
01:02:51,395 --> 01:02:53,924
I am relieved to hear that from you.

843
01:02:54,995 --> 01:02:56,565
I will get going then.

844
01:02:59,694 --> 01:03:00,835
Wait, Mi So.

845
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:07,775
You're here.

846
01:03:13,545 --> 01:03:16,045
Did you finish talking to the head of the hall?

847
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,255
Why do you look so upset?

848
01:03:21,824 --> 01:03:23,085
Mi So came to...

849
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:24,424
go over my script for the lecture.

850
01:03:25,824 --> 01:03:27,355
If you can't even do that alone,

851
01:03:27,455 --> 01:03:29,125
you shouldn't be giving the lecture.

852
01:03:33,534 --> 01:03:34,634
Let's go.

853
01:03:52,585 --> 01:03:53,654
Mr. Lee.

854
01:03:54,484 --> 01:03:56,355
- What you saw is... - Mr. Lee.

855
01:03:58,424 --> 01:03:59,795
The Chairman is looking for you.

856
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:01,495
Let's go.

857
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:08,165
"Once in a Lifetime" is a big hit.

858
01:04:08,534 --> 01:04:09,804
It became a bestseller...

859
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,505
as soon as it came out.

860
01:04:12,105 --> 01:04:14,205
Isn't he amazing, everyone?

861
01:04:14,205 --> 01:04:15,304
He is.

862
01:04:21,784 --> 01:04:23,145
What is "Once in a Lifetime" about?

863
01:04:23,145 --> 01:04:26,614
I can't believe Sung Yeon decided to show himself to the public.

864
01:04:26,915 --> 01:04:27,984
I love it.

865
01:04:31,495 --> 01:04:32,855
You made it all happen.

866
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,025
That's not true.

867
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,435
Excuse me, ma'am.

868
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,844
Your new book is titled...

869
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,344
"Once in a Lifetime".

870
01:04:51,844 --> 01:04:53,114
Then did you meet...

871
01:04:53,114 --> 01:04:55,484
the love of your life?

872
01:04:56,214 --> 01:04:57,315
I did just recently.

873
01:04:57,585 --> 01:04:59,284
- Really? - Yes.

874
01:04:59,984 --> 01:05:02,125
I reunited with the woman who stayed with me...

875
01:05:03,185 --> 01:05:05,625
when I was little and trapped in the dark.

876
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:09,295
I wouldn't have been able to bear it if I was alone.

877
01:05:11,094 --> 01:05:14,565
But she was there for me. I won't let go of her.

878
01:05:17,534 --> 01:05:20,134
I will risk my everything to protect her.

879
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:00,045
What's going on?

880
01:06:02,284 --> 01:06:03,714
I have something to tell you.

881
01:06:19,465 --> 01:06:20,595
What is it that you want to tell me?

882
01:06:22,364 --> 01:06:23,465
It's a misunderstanding.

883
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:24,904
What is?

884
01:06:25,635 --> 01:06:27,274
What you heard just now...

885
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,375
and what you saw awhile ago are all misunderstandings.

886
01:06:29,845 --> 01:06:31,045
You don't need to explain.

887
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:32,845
I told you I'd bear everything.

888
01:06:33,545 --> 01:06:35,484
No. I will explain.

889
01:06:35,484 --> 01:06:36,644
I want to make it clear.

890
01:06:42,654 --> 01:06:45,425
Why are you telling me this so suddenly?

891
01:06:46,255 --> 01:06:48,324
I don't want there to be any misunderstandings between us.

892
01:06:50,064 --> 01:06:52,434
You might misunderstand me and we might grow apart.

893
01:06:54,604 --> 01:06:55,805
And I'm scared of that.

894
01:07:01,175 --> 01:07:02,175
Why?

895
01:07:05,345 --> 01:07:06,545
Because I like you.

896
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,125
You confessed your feelings to me many times.

897
01:07:15,724 --> 01:07:17,625
I am sorry I'm so late.

898
01:07:19,925 --> 01:07:20,955
I...

899
01:07:22,425 --> 01:07:23,925
like you.

900
01:09:46,534 --> 01:09:48,675
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

901
01:09:50,175 --> 01:09:52,814
This is our first meal together as a couple.

902
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,045
So I want it to be at a special place.

903
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:55,814
Okay. I will book a special place.

904
01:09:55,814 --> 01:09:57,784
People might think your name is "Mi So".

905
01:09:58,654 --> 01:10:00,684
I think we need to sort things out.

906
01:10:00,885 --> 01:10:02,024
My gosh!

907
01:10:02,755 --> 01:10:04,625
He made photocopies himself.

908
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:05,724
He made photocopies?

909
01:10:06,154 --> 01:10:07,154
Do you want some?

910
01:10:07,154 --> 01:10:08,724
No, sir!

911
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:12,534
Tell us honestly.

912
01:10:12,635 --> 01:10:15,165
Are you keeping it a secret from us?

913
01:10:15,165 --> 01:10:16,165
What?
