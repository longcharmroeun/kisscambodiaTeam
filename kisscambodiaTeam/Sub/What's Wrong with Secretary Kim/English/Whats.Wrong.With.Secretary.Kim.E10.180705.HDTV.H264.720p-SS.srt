1
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:37,421
It was a chilly day when he left home.

2
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:39,152
He usually gets cold easily.

3
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,092
What if I get cold?

4
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,692
- I will be fine. - I was talking about me.

5
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:45,622
I meant what should I do if I catch a cold.

6
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,332
You get cold easily, don't you?

7
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:50,762
I will never forget your name.

8
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:53,131
Your name is Lee...

9
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:55,832
- Lee... - Idiot. You did it again.

10
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:58,171
That's not my name.

11
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,872
- It's Lee Sung... - How did...

12
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:03,071
How was my Hyun doing?

13
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,581
Right.

14
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:09,451
She clearly called him "Hyun".

15
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:14,992
Young children often make cognitive errors.

16
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,822
What if I mistook it for something...

17
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:19,592
with a similar pronunciation?

18
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:33,941
Sung Hyun?

19
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,641
What?

20
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,872
I clearly called you "Sung Hyun".

21
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:05,542
Why did you answer me?

22
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:09,672
By any chance,

23
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,112
have you changed your name?

24
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:18,022
Perhaps your old name was Lee Sung Hyun?

25
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,131
I don't know what you are talking about.

26
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:33,101
When I was talking about the kidnapping incident to your mother,

27
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:34,702
I clearly heard it.

28
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:36,432
She said "My Hyun".

29
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:42,142
I want to know what happened exactly.

30
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:49,851
Ms. Kim.

31
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:54,892
Don't give too much meaning to my sleep talking.

32
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,731
I just habitually answered because I heard your voice.

33
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:07,332
Let's go home. I'll drop you off.

34
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:48,541
He seemed really natural as if he was responding to his name.

35
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,832
When I was talking about the kidnapping incident to your mother,

36
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,231
I clearly heard it.

37
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:12,101
She said "My Hyun".

38
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,172
I want to know what happened exactly.

39
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:20,272
Come with me.

40
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:22,671
I don't want to go alone. Come with me.

41
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:26,981
You don't need to know.

42
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:43,762
No.

43
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:47,471
Don't leave me here alone.

44
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,202
I don't want to...

45
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:53,842
make you cry ever again.

46
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,152
(Episode 10)

47
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,762
What brings you here so early, Ms. Kim?

48
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:15,991
You hurried here, so it must be something serious.

49
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,931
Actually, I have something to ask you.

50
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:24,301
You can ask me anything.

51
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:29,272
By any chance, has Mr. Lee...

52
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,312
ever changed his name?

53
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:35,012
What?

54
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,851
Previously, you...

55
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:40,652
once mentioned "my Hyun".

56
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:44,221
I thought perhaps you were referring to Mr. Lee.

57
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,062
I don't...

58
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,301
You must've misheard me.

59
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,931
No. You clearly...

60
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:57,101
asked me, "How was my Hyun doing?"

61
00:05:57,642 --> 00:06:00,541
It was while you were talking about the kidnapping incident.

62
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:10,111
I don't know how it might sound to you.

63
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:15,491
I think that boy "Hyun" is Mr. Lee.

64
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:22,291
How can you think of such a ridiculous idea?

65
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,902
I know it's a difficult favor.

66
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,041
But if there's something I don't know about,

67
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,671
can you tell me?

68
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,781
The person you were with...

69
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,721
when you were little...

70
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,851
was Sung Yeon.

71
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:49,152
I don't know who is "Hyun".

72
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,592
You misheard me, Ms. Kim.

73
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,991
- But... - Ms. Kim.

74
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:57,962
I'm a bit tired.

75
00:06:58,562 --> 00:07:01,202
Could you leave for today?

76
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:04,971
I see.

77
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:07,411
I will be taking my leave now, then.

78
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:41,942
What brings you to my house so early in the morning?

79
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,812
I was just meeting with Ms. Choi.

80
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:48,712
I was actually about to contact you. What a perfect timing.

81
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:51,152
Regarding what?

82
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:53,351
I have something to return to you. Your diary.

83
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,022
Wait here. I'll get it for you.

84
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,531
Excuse me.

85
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:05,101
Was there...

86
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,502
anything else you remembered after reading my diary?

87
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:11,642
I don't think so.

88
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,212
Sorry.

89
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,241
You don't remember...

90
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:19,741
any of the features of the woman who kidnapped us?

91
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,481
For example, what she looked like,

92
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,551
how long her hair was, or what her build was like?

93
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,221
I don't remember at all.

94
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:29,252
You don't have any memories...

95
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:31,522
of when we were captured or how we escaped either?

96
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:32,662
Nothing at all?

97
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,962
Why are you asking me this all of the sudden?

98
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:44,442
Because it seems to me that my diary was of no help to you at all.

99
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:46,802
And it didn't trigger any memories for you either.

100
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,011
I see.

101
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:56,751
It may not be that I can't remember, but won't remember.

102
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,751
Maybe it's a subconscious defense mechanism...

103
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:03,592
since that experience was quite traumatic for me.

104
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:09,631
Anyway, wait for me in the living room.

105
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,832
I'll bring it to you quickly.

106
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,542
Why does it sound like Sung Yeon's memories...

107
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:22,312
consist of things he heard about from someone else?

108
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:52,641
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

109
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,741
Here's your diary.

110
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:00,682
Excuse me.

111
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:05,822
Which one of these two...

112
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:08,021
is you, Sung Yeon?

113
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,491
I'm right here.

114
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,621
The one on the left is me.

115
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:15,062
Don't you remember?

116
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:23,601
I thought about it, Mi So, and...

117
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:26,871
I don't think the only reason why I like you...

118
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,511
is because we were together back then.

119
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,942
I'm not asking you to give me an immediate answer.

120
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,052
I just...

121
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,322
want you to know how I feel, is all.

122
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:05,412
Did you move in well, Ji Ah?

123
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:08,151
Yes, it only took me five minutes to get to work.

124
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,282
It's great.

125
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:11,851
My new place is so cozy and comfortable too.

126
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:13,792
So when are you going to invite us...

127
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,322
to that cozy and comfortable place?

128
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,261
- Pardon? - A housewarming.

129
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:25,202
It's a studio apartment, so it's quite small.

130
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:28,401
And I'm really bad at cooking too.

131
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,172
Honey, come on.

132
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:34,672
We're not the type of people who pressure our juniors like that.

133
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:37,381
You only need to get a few things like fried chicken, jokbal,

134
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:39,942
sweet and sour pork, braised short ribs,

135
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:42,082
and have it delivered to your place.

136
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,351
We don't need much.

137
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:45,582
Doesn't that make you feel so much better?

138
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:48,192
You really are blessed when it comes to your coworkers.

139
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:50,221
Come to think of it, tomorrow is the weekend.

140
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:52,221
Goodness, it's perfect.

141
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,261
Tomorrow it is, then.

142
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,292
- Okay? - Okay?

143
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:58,401
Sure.

144
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:04,001
Ms. Kim!

145
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:05,842
- Hello. - Hello.

146
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,611
We're going to go to Ji Ah's housewarming tomorrow.

147
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:08,771
You can make it, right?

148
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:12,412
I have a family thing to attend tomorrow.

149
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:13,981
All right then.

150
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:18,251
So how much money should we collect from each person...

151
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,452
for the housewarming gift?

152
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,552
Including Mr. Yang,

153
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:24,261
there are five of us. So how about 20 dollars each?

154
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:27,332
Mr. Yang is always on standby so he won't be able to come.

155
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,901
Also, what do you mean, 20 dollars each? How ignorant.

156
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,731
That's nowhere near enough for a decent present.

157
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,401
- Our clever Mr. Park... - Yes?

158
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:37,601
should collect at least...

159
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,202
24.90 from each person, don't you think?

160
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:41,842
All right then.

161
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:43,741
Let's go to the housewarming tomorrow!

162
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:46,741
- I'm so happy now. - What should I wear?

163
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:48,412
I'm going to pour this happy energy into my work.

164
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,792
(Vice Chairman Lee Young Joon)

165
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:05,101
I knew it. Mr. Lee was the boy I was searching for.

166
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:09,401
So why is everyone telling me that it's Sung Yeon?

167
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,842
Did Mr. Lee really lose his memories?

168
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,442
I should probably play dumb about it too, right?

169
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:29,792
Good morning, Ms. Kim.

170
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:49,011
You'll be visiting our affiliates starting from 3pm.

171
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:51,011
After that, you will have dinner with Mr. Park.

172
00:13:51,182 --> 00:13:53,212
And Ji Ah will be accompanying you today.

173
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:57,751
Then does that mean I won't be able to see you until dinnertime today?

174
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:59,452
Yes.

175
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:01,251
What a shame.

176
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,292
Come over to my place tonight, then.

177
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,761
Pardon? At night?

178
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:21,641
What are you imagining?

179
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,881
Figures. "My house" and "at night".

180
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:29,251
The peculiar and sexy image that the combination of these words evoke...

181
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,481
is probably enough to make anyone's imagination run wild.

182
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:34,721
I don't know about that.

183
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,092
I didn't attend a creative school when I was young like you did,

184
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:39,162
so my imagination is quite underdeveloped.

185
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:40,891
Now that's a shame.

186
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:43,491
I want to organize a few documents in my personal library.

187
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,562
Can you help me?

188
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,662
Of course. Don't worry...

189
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:48,971
Young Joon.

190
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:55,241
What?

191
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:58,212
What did you just say?

192
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:01,312
I just wanted to call you that once.

193
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,351
And refer to you in that intimate way.

194
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:12,121
You can continue calling me that. I will allow it.

195
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:13,861
No, once is more than enough.

196
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:15,032
I will be going now.

197
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:17,231
I said you can keep calling me...

198
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:24,302
I should have recorded that or something.

199
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:40,552
Mr. Lee.

200
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:43,891
Mr. Lee?

201
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,162
You're here earlier than I expected.

202
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:57,971
I'm sure it'll be dangerous to your heart...

203
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,401
for you to see the muscles hidden under this robe,

204
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:02,611
so I'll hurry and change into something else.

205
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,082
Is that scar...

206
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:15,292
from being tied up when he was kidnapped?

207
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:19,521
It must have been so painful.

208
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:45,851
Goodness, why am I crying?

209
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:53,761
Oh, Pil Nam.

210
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,192
Where are you, Mi So?

211
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:57,361
- I'm at the vice chairman's house. - What?

212
00:16:57,702 --> 00:16:59,802
Why are you there at this hour?

213
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:01,901
Are you really going out with him?

214
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:04,241
With that selfish punk who cares only about himself?

215
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:06,371
Pil Nam.

216
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:09,941
He isn't selfish.

217
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,782
He's much better than I think he is.

218
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:15,982
So...

219
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:20,752
I hope you don't worry about our relationship anymore.

220
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:30,092
Anyway, don't forget to be there by 12pm tomorrow.

221
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:31,732
Don't be late.

222
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:34,701
Okay, bye.

223
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,211
This is driving me crazy.

224
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:04,201
Is her family against our relationship? Even to make her cry?

225
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:08,272
Why?

226
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:12,002
I thought they would put up a placard to welcome me.

227
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:17,242
By any chance, are they burdened because I'm way too perfect?

228
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,881
Young Joon, you brat.

229
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,522
Can't you be less perfect?

230
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:33,832
I'm so resentful of myself.

231
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,101
Ms. Kim.

232
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:47,671
Everything will go well.

233
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,911
Except for the classified data, I'll discard documents over 10 years old.

234
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:52,982
Not that.

235
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:56,451
Your complicated concerns.

236
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:58,222
They'll all be okay.

237
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:00,752
What do you mean?

238
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:02,391
I heard you talk on the phone earlier.

239
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:06,022
Your sisters seemed to be very worried about us.

240
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:10,092
I'll make set them free from their concern soon.

241
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:14,401
You know my fatal aura...

242
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:16,431
that captures people's hearts.

243
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:26,842
I'll convince them by any means,

244
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:28,982
so don't cry from now on.

245
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,802
You didn't have to take me home.

246
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,972
I should do that in order to stay with you longer.

247
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:50,572
It would've felt bad if we said goodbye at my place.

248
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:52,701
I mean, you.

249
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:55,611
That's right.

250
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:59,641
I don't have any schedule tomorrow. Want me to go on a date with you?

251
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:04,052
Not tomorrow. I have a family gathering to attend.

252
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:08,421
Is it the only weekend which you rest in a year?

253
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:10,961
- Right. - Is it Jebu Island this year too?

254
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:12,921
Yes.

255
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:16,792
I'll go in then.

256
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:21,802
Oh, right.

257
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:26,401
This.

258
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:33,812
What's that?

259
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:58,542
Goodbye, then.

260
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:00,171
Gosh, dear.

261
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:15,691
Bye.

262
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,242
Is something bothering you?

263
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:36,441
Your face looks like you want me to ask you that question.

264
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:37,881
Yes.

265
00:21:38,812 --> 00:21:40,951
Do ask me because I want to rattle this on somewhere.

266
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:42,681
Go ahead then.

267
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:44,552
Should I?

268
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:49,951
I saw my ex-wife a few days ago.

269
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:52,522
I saw her with another man.

270
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:55,332
She looked very happy.

271
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,502
- And you look unhappy. - Right.

272
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:02,572
I'm confident I'll be the top three unhappy people of this month.

273
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:05,802
I mean, how could she date another man already?

274
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:07,002
How could she?

275
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:08,972
You should've done better while she was with you.

276
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,111
I was...

277
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,812
I was so good to her.

278
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:18,482
I bought her bags and jewelry whenever she wants them.

279
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:21,451
I made her breakfast and I even told her that her bare face was pretty.

280
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,921
I was so good to my ex-wife...

281
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:26,361
and her family too.

282
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:28,161
To her family too?

283
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:29,691
There's this saying that goes,

284
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:32,601
"Love me, love my dog."

285
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:35,332
That was the case for me.

286
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:38,441
I loved her parents and even her siblings.

287
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,772
"Gosh, my dear in-laws."

288
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:42,812
"Good, good."

289
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:45,611
Then they loved me too.

290
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:48,611
- You? - Yes, me.

291
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,681
What did you do?

292
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,982
- Can't you trust me? - That's not it.

293
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:55,421
I'm just asking if you had your own know-how.

294
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:57,062
You see...

295
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:07,572
Do you want to win her family's favor?

296
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,431
Gosh, what are you talking about?

297
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,742
How should I explain this...

298
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:19,941
to make you understand?

299
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:25,222
All right, listen.

300
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:28,651
You know subcontractors are working desperately...

301
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:30,861
to win a contract with us, right?

302
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:32,762
They constantly try to prove themselves.

303
00:23:32,762 --> 00:23:34,661
They appeal their good sides as a company.

304
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,562
- Right. - That's it.

305
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:41,072
You're like a subcontractor...

306
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:44,701
who needs to be examined by a conglomerate named Ms. Kim's family.

307
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:47,772
You have zero percent of reliability since you just opened your business.

308
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:51,641
From now on, you have to appeal and prove...

309
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:53,911
your strength.

310
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:56,911
Now it starts to make sense.

311
00:23:57,822 --> 00:23:59,381
So what did you do?

312
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:02,552
Here it comes.

313
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,391
Lower your waist 45 degrees to the bottom.

314
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:09,592
Hold your hands together.

315
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:15,701
"Yes, yes. Sure, sure. Goodness."

316
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,242
"Good. Great."

317
00:24:17,242 --> 00:24:18,641
I did everything they asked me for.

318
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:21,272
What?

319
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:25,782
When I went to see her family,

320
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,451
I left my pride at home.

321
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:30,851
Is that necessary?

322
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:32,621
You have to do that much...

323
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,322
to get accepted by her family.

324
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,522
What is this now?

325
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:42,792
I was telling my issue a while ago, but why is it the other way around?

326
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:44,232
Gosh, I'm getting goose bumps.

327
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,701
The acceptance from her family...

328
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:01,151
I cleaned the place, so enjoy your stay.

329
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:03,082
- Thank you. - Thank you.

330
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,792
It's comfortable and nice.

331
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:15,461
It feels like our relative's house since we come here every year.

332
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:20,631
By the way, Mi So,

333
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,032
why do you look so down?

334
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:25,701
You didn't look so good on our way here either.

335
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:27,272
What's the matter?

336
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:28,772
It's nothing.

337
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:30,842
Is it because of what I said yesterday?

338
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:34,982
- Because I urged you? - That's not it.

339
00:25:34,982 --> 00:25:38,022
Mi So, I'm like your mom.

340
00:25:38,222 --> 00:25:41,391
I can't stay still when my youngest is about to begin a tough love.

341
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:44,191
No matter how much I think about it, he's not the one.

342
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:48,961
It's because you haven't met him before.

343
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:52,601
- There are so many good things... - Did you lose our weight?

344
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,472
You look slimmer to see you after a while.

345
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:55,802
- Really? - Yes.

346
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:57,101
But I gained 2kg.

347
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:00,842
Maybe it's because of these black clothes.

348
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:05,911
Anyway, I don't know the details,

349
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:07,552
but don't be so upset.

350
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:10,552
We need to have some real fun today.

351
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:13,951
Right, let's have some fun.

352
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:15,252
Let's do it.

353
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,562
Let's get all excited at Ji Ah's house today.

354
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:28,171
- Are we almost there? - Yes.

355
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:29,502
It's over there.

356
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,772
- Oh, here? - This place?

357
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:32,502
It's you, Ji Ah.

358
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:33,972
Hello.

359
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:36,411
They must be your guests.

360
00:26:36,772 --> 00:26:39,282
I'm having a housewarming party.

361
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:42,552
Your house is small, so you guys should play at the rooftop then.

362
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:46,621
- Enjoy your visit then. - Bye.

363
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:48,451
The rooftop?

364
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:50,252
It's good.

365
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:52,722
If we drink at the rooftop with a broad view,

366
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:54,861
we might really enjoy our drinking.

367
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:58,232
No way. It's too hot to be at the rooftop.

368
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,532
Let's just do it in my place.

369
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:03,002
Come on. The weather is nice, so the rooftop is perfect.

370
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:04,201
Let's go...

371
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,502
to the rooftop as high as my qualifications.

372
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:10,012
Still, it must be uncomfortable for the person...

373
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,312
who lives in the rooftop studio.

374
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:14,951
It's not like we're here every day. They'll understand.

375
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:16,482
Let's go.

376
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:17,822
Hold on.

377
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:21,492
Then can you guys stop by my place...

378
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:23,992
and bring the food up with you?

379
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:27,092
I'll go upstairs first and wipe the table.

380
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:29,931
It's really dirty. Take your time.

381
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:32,232
Okay, okay.

382
00:27:32,262 --> 00:27:34,701
- She's very kind. - She's pretty nice.

383
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:35,901
- Rooftop is good. - Let's go.

384
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:38,472
She must've prepared a lot for this party.

385
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:44,842
Grow up, veggies.

386
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:48,381
You don't need to be tiny just because you're cherry tomatoes.

387
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,292
- We're in trouble. - What?

388
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:56,492
Are the company people coming up or something?

389
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,322
How did you know?

390
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,592
They're all coming up right now.

391
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,292
They're here for my housewarming party,

392
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,832
and they want to play at the rooftop.

393
00:28:03,861 --> 00:28:06,161
- What? - There's no time for this. Hide.

394
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:09,131
Why should I hide? You have to stop them from coming.

395
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:10,332
Goodness.

396
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:12,802
- Are we there? - Gosh, it's cold.

397
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:17,282
Hurry. Hurry in.

398
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,911
- Goodness. - What should we do?

399
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:22,012
- Gosh, what now? - Darn it.

400
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:23,151
Where are you going?

401
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,052
It's good.

402
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:31,191
Gosh, it's hot. Gosh, my back.

403
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:33,661
Why are you already here?

404
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:36,292
I asked you to stop by my house and get the food.

405
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:39,461
I have my juniors to carry the food for me.

406
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:42,131
Gosh, I can't carry heavy stuff.

407
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:45,042
My bones are too thin. You know how feminine I am.

408
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:47,242
That's my style. Gosh, it's tiring.

409
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:50,242
By the way, I love this wooden bench.

410
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:52,782
- I'm here. - You're here.

411
00:28:56,512 --> 00:28:59,451
What a nice view.

412
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,351
It must have a great view at night.

413
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,621
Let's drink and enjoy all night long then.

414
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:06,421
- Until night? - Why on earth...

415
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:09,492
- Let's sit. - Have a seat.

416
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:13,461
- You ordered so much food. - I know.

417
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,302
- Gosh. - Let's eat first.

418
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,401
Gosh, look at these cherry tomatoes.

419
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:36,522
Hurry.

420
00:29:38,421 --> 00:29:39,461
Let's eat.

421
00:29:51,242 --> 00:29:52,342
Sir.

422
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:01,482
What brings you here?

423
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:05,982
It's nice to meet you. I'm Lee Young Joon.

424
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:17,161
Tell me what's going on.

425
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:20,671
You said you stayed at the same inn in Jebu Island every year.

426
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:24,572
You played badminton at an elementary school playground...

427
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,141
near the inn and had your ankle sprained two years ago.

428
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:29,772
I searched for an inn next to the elementary school.

429
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:32,911
That's not what I'm asking about. For what are you here?

430
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:34,651
I'm with my sisters.

431
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:36,312
That's why I'm here.

432
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:40,691
They're worried about our relationship.

433
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:43,322
I want to get rid of their worries.

434
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,461
- I'll do my best to get their... - Mi So.

435
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:51,131
Guys.

436
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:56,201
You must not be here to make her work.

437
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:58,401
May I ask why you're here?

438
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,772
Are you going out by any chance?

439
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:06,211
- Well, that's... - Yes, we are.

440
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:13,252
I know you're worried about our relationship.

441
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:15,921
But you don't have to worry so much.

442
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:18,092
Much more than you think,

443
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:19,992
we like each other.

444
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:23,062
I mean, she likes me.

445
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:34,042
Of course, I like her very much.

446
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:37,441
Shall we move to our resort and talk more about this?

447
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:41,012
- I've prepared a suite room. - No, thank you.

448
00:31:41,752 --> 00:31:44,451
You told me not to worry about you two,

449
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:45,921
but I can't help worrying about it...

450
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:47,951
because you seem to live in a whole lot different world from ours.

451
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:51,792
It's very uncomfortable to see you unexpectedly like this.

452
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:55,592
Pil Nam.

453
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,631
Didn't you guys say you were hungry? Let's go.

454
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:59,101
- Let's go eat. - Then...

455
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,431
Let's go eat together.

456
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,371
- I reserved the best restaurant... - No, thank you.

457
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:07,072
We did reserve a restaurant too.

458
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:10,242
Let's go there together then.

459
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,482
What?

460
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,082
Are you sure about that?

461
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:24,592
(Soy sauce marinated crabs)

462
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:26,661
(All-you-can-eat Restaurant)

463
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:32,262
You seem surprised.

464
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:34,472
Are you surprised because you can eat as much as you want...

465
00:32:34,472 --> 00:32:36,401
with only 19 dollars and 99 cents per person?

466
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:39,701
I'm surprised that they can make profit out of this system.

467
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:41,171
It's possible...

468
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:44,042
because they make food with cheap ingredients.

469
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,752
I'm not sure if you can eat cheap marinated crabs.

470
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:51,451
You must've had marinated crabs cooked by master chef.

471
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:54,351
You can go back if it's uncomfortable for you.

472
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:56,851
No, I'm just like the others.

473
00:32:56,951 --> 00:32:58,592
I don't feel uncomfortable at all.

474
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:08,532
Sir, it's still not so late to go back.

475
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:10,901
I'm going to have those marinated crabs.

476
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,742
"All you can eat".

477
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,451
I can do it, Ms. Kim.

478
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:33,161
Didn't you say you were going out? Do you still call her "Ms. Kim"?

479
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,931
And you add "sir" at the end of every sentence?

480
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,401
That's a great point.

481
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:44,502
I was thinking of changing the way we call each other anyway.

482
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:47,572
You can call me by my name, Mi So.

483
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,582
Pil Nam, we'll take care of it ourselves.

484
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:55,381
I'm so full.

485
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:58,722
I feel like my stomach's filled with marinated crabs up to this point.

486
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:05,092
I'm going to fill it to this point now.

487
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:11,532
Why does she keep eating when she's full?

488
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:13,032
It's to get our money's worth.

489
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:14,901
- What? - We're paying...

490
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:16,831
the same amount of money, so it's good to eat as much as possible.

491
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:21,742
Oh, you aren't so familiar with this way of thinking, are you?

492
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:25,611
The thought of forcing ourselves to eat so we can get our money's worth.

493
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:26,981
I am.

494
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,881
Haven't you heard rich people are more like that?

495
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,682
It's the case for me.

496
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:35,492
I'll eat more than my money's worth here today.

497
00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:37,262
All right. Let's begin.

498
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:47,072
The meat is plump.

499
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:19,096
<font color="#8080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E10 What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

500
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:49,691
I'll go get one more plate.

501
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,361
Hey, young man.

502
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:54,131
Are you going to stop eating marinated crabs after today?

503
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:56,501
Don't risk your life on it.

504
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,572
Goodness.

505
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:03,271
It's enough.

506
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:05,581
You've gotten enough of it already.

507
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:07,481
Is that right?

508
00:36:11,021 --> 00:36:13,021
I'll stop here then.

509
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:15,251
Now, I don't feel like wasting my money.

510
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,702
Maybe I ate too much.

511
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:34,372
My stomach is full of crabs.

512
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:39,412
Here's water.

513
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,782
Are you having an upset stomach?

514
00:36:43,182 --> 00:36:45,521
I'm perfect in all kinds of abilities.

515
00:36:45,822 --> 00:36:47,521
Even my digestive ability is great.

516
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:52,222
Why don't you go home now that you're done with your meal?

517
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:02,231
Those outfits are...

518
00:37:03,372 --> 00:37:05,001
We're heading out to catch clams.

519
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:08,012
We catch clams...

520
00:37:08,012 --> 00:37:09,742
and cook them when we come here every year.

521
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:13,541
Why would they do such labor when they're on vacation?

522
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:16,151
Right, you probably can't understand us.

523
00:37:16,512 --> 00:37:17,682
I bet...

524
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:20,421
you have personal chefs who cook for you with seasonal produce.

525
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:23,291
You must have no idea why we have to catch clams ourselves...

526
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,492
when we want to make kalguksu with fresh seafood.

527
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:30,631
This is why we said that we feel like you live in a different world.

528
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:34,032
I'll go with you and help you catch clams.

529
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:36,872
Sorry?

530
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:39,572
It's all right.

531
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:41,742
I'm sure you've never lifted a finger in your life.

532
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:43,811
You won't be able to dig on a mudflat to catch them.

533
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:44,981
I certainly can.

534
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:48,052
If it's with Ms. Kim,

535
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,622
I can go anywhere even if it's a mudflat or a thornbush.

536
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:03,532
Let's go to the beach.

537
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:05,602
It's a mudflat.

538
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:07,501
Right, I'll go with you to the mudflat.

539
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,572
- Everything is so delicious. - It's really good.

540
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:12,671
All the food is so tasty.

541
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:14,012
All right, everyone.

542
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:17,782
This is Ji Ah's housewarming party, you know.

543
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:19,081
Let's clink our glasses together.

544
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,412
Shall we? Let's do it!

545
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:22,512
Here's to Ji Ah's happy life.

546
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:24,282
- Cheers! - Cheers!

547
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:27,092
Bottoms up!

548
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,762
I can't stop drinking.

549
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:35,992
My gosh, it's so nice here.

550
00:38:35,992 --> 00:38:37,532
- Oh, no. - Gosh, my purse.

551
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:38,901
Wait!

552
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:41,231
What?

553
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:44,401
I'll bring you something to wipe it with.

554
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,271
Goodness, this is brand new.

555
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:48,642
Thanks, Ji Ah. She's so thoughtful.

556
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:53,182
I thought it'd be cooler out here, but the sun is very strong.

557
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:54,852
Shall we move to the shade over there?

558
00:38:54,852 --> 00:38:57,081
I know, right? UV rays are the worst thing for the skin.

559
00:38:57,322 --> 00:38:58,421
Let's move right away.

560
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,151
- Let's go. - Get up, everyone.

561
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,191
All right.

562
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,691
- That side will probably be better. - Yes, let's move to that side.

563
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,421
- Let's lift this together. - Okay.

564
00:39:05,421 --> 00:39:06,662
1, 2, 3.

565
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:09,231
- Go that way. - My gosh.

566
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:12,001
- Oh, boy. - 1, 2.

567
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:15,372
- Go, team. We can do this. - 1, 2, 1, 2.

568
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:17,072
- Keep going. - 1, 2, 1, 2.

569
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:19,001
Oh, boy.

570
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:22,171
Surprise.

571
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:26,881
Mr. Ko, what are you doing on the floor?

572
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,352
I told you.

573
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:29,751
I wanted to surprise you all.

574
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:32,122
"Surprise"?

575
00:39:32,481 --> 00:39:35,151
That's right. She invited me to this housewarming party as well.

576
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:38,892
But I'm a person with a creative mind, who thinks that...

577
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:40,662
brilliant ideas matter even when I'm just hanging out.

578
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:42,361
So I wanted to do something fun.

579
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:44,631
That's why Ms. Kim over there and I planned this together.

580
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,361
I was hiding like this...

581
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:48,072
and waiting for the best moment...

582
00:39:48,072 --> 00:39:50,032
to maximize the fun,

583
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:52,802
and you guys decided to move the table right at that moment.

584
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:56,771
That was good timing.

585
00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:05,251
Nice one! You totally surprised us.

586
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:07,791
Let's finish the food.

587
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:09,622
Mr. Ko, you should have some food too.

588
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:11,392
- Let's eat. - Okay.

589
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,892
- Let's sit. - Oh, boy.

590
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:14,992
Mr. Ko, would you like some beer?

591
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:16,432
Oh, it looks like we need more beer.

592
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,262
That's all we have now. I'll go buy more, then.

593
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:21,831
No, I'll go. I saw a big supermarket over there.

594
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:23,472
I'll go and buy more. That's okay, right?

595
00:40:23,472 --> 00:40:26,271
What's gotten into you? Why are you volunteering to run such an errand?

596
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:27,671
If I want to drink more,

597
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:30,012
I need to take a walk and digest what I've eaten so far.

598
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:32,711
- All right, then. Have a good walk. - Okay, I certainly will.

599
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,782
- You guys should keep eating. - See you in a bit.

600
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:36,782
- Do you want soju? - This is refreshing.

601
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,171
That looks so good.

602
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,032
- Hello. - I can try it, right?

603
00:40:56,032 --> 00:40:58,041
Of course. We're running a buy-1-get-1-free promotion now.

604
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,102
- Really? - Yes.

605
00:41:03,012 --> 00:41:04,111
It's so good.

606
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,711
I'm going to eat one more.

607
00:41:06,182 --> 00:41:07,182
Miss.

608
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:09,611
How could you eat three pieces?

609
00:41:10,822 --> 00:41:11,981
You're not even going to buy it.

610
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:13,791
We're going to buy it.

611
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:17,762
1, 2, 3.

612
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:22,762
We'll buy three,

613
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,032
so don't embarrass this lady anymore.

614
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,972
Let's go, Ms. Bong.

615
00:41:30,742 --> 00:41:31,771
Okay.

616
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,751
Is your boss coming or what?

617
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,961
Why did he bluff like that when he wasn't even confident?

618
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:55,191
Pil Nam!

619
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:57,662
Why are you glaring at me like that?

620
00:41:57,662 --> 00:41:59,162
Don't you think you're being too harsh on him?

621
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,171
I know that you're flustered...

622
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:02,432
because this is all too sudden,

623
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:04,372
but don't you think you're being too rude to him?

624
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:06,702
Mi So, I'm just worried about you.

625
00:42:06,702 --> 00:42:08,372
I told you that you have no reason to worry.

626
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:10,711
He's not the kind of person you two think he is.

627
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:12,682
He protects me when I'm scared,

628
00:42:12,682 --> 00:42:14,751
and he's always so considerate of me.

629
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:17,122
You don't even know anything.

630
00:42:22,052 --> 00:42:24,492
My gosh! Oh, my goodness.

631
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:25,861
Gosh, look at that.

632
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:28,861
My goodness.

633
00:42:43,512 --> 00:42:44,711
I'm sorry I'm late.

634
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:58,521
Mr. Lee, where did you get those things?

635
00:42:58,722 --> 00:43:00,432
I must do everything perfectly.

636
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:01,691
That's my life motto.

637
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,501
Being fully equipped doesn't mean you can do a perfect job.

638
00:43:04,802 --> 00:43:07,401
You need know-hows from years of experience,

639
00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:09,771
which we have.

640
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:11,001
Pil Nam.

641
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:16,711
Then how about we have a showdown?

642
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:18,642
- A showdown? - You two can team up.

643
00:43:18,642 --> 00:43:19,711
The two of us will be a team.

644
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:21,282
The losers will grant the winners their wish.

645
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:22,581
- What do you say? - I'm in!

646
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:25,421
Sure, whatever.

647
00:43:38,602 --> 00:43:39,631
Ms. Kim.

648
00:43:39,932 --> 00:43:41,901
I'll do my best since this is a competition,

649
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:44,602
but what will you tell them as your wish?

650
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,142
I'm going to ask them not to hate you.

651
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,682
That totally melted my fatigue away.

652
00:44:08,262 --> 00:44:09,291
Nice.

653
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:11,631
These are just gravels.

654
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:15,131
This isn't a good spot.

655
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:33,852
Now, we're talking.

656
00:44:35,852 --> 00:44:36,892
Clams.

657
00:44:38,861 --> 00:44:39,861
Short-necked clams!

658
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,032
Now, I just need to collect them.

659
00:44:58,282 --> 00:44:59,381
We beat you.

660
00:45:00,182 --> 00:45:02,811
You sure did. Congratulations, Mi So.

661
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:04,251
And Mr. Lee.

662
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:09,092
So? What's your wish, Mi So?

663
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:10,861
My wish is...

664
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:17,401
I just want to ask you two not to hate Mr. Lee.

665
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:23,771
It's okay. You can hate me.

666
00:45:24,642 --> 00:45:25,702
But...

667
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:28,012
please wait and see.

668
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:31,311
I'll keep showing you how sincere my feelings toward Mi So are.

669
00:45:38,782 --> 00:45:40,592
All right, let's get going. Come on.

670
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:46,662
Are you all right?

671
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,162
Yes.

672
00:45:50,432 --> 00:45:53,262
By the way, why are your hands so cold?

673
00:45:54,572 --> 00:45:55,631
Let me see.

674
00:45:57,642 --> 00:45:59,702
Is your stomach upset by any chance?

675
00:46:00,472 --> 00:46:03,782
You ate too much earlier. You inhaled the marinated crab.

676
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:05,381
Well, it's...

677
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:07,081
Follow me. Let me find you a digestive aid.

678
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:08,881
Ms. Kim, wait.

679
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:09,981
- We should take the clams... - No.

680
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:11,521
- But the clams... - Come on.

681
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:12,552
Our clams...

682
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:14,392
Pil Nam.

683
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:16,421
It looks like he ended up...

684
00:46:16,421 --> 00:46:19,222
with an upset stomach because he ate too much to impress us, right?

685
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:23,032
We never told him to force himself to eat that much.

686
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:26,731
I must say, I'm a little surprised.

687
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:29,271
He seemed so snobby...

688
00:46:29,271 --> 00:46:30,802
when I saw him on the news,

689
00:46:30,802 --> 00:46:32,302
but he came all the way here...

690
00:46:32,302 --> 00:46:34,842
and he's doing his best to impress us despite you being mean to him.

691
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:38,381
He must really care about Mi So.

692
00:46:38,742 --> 00:46:39,782
Don't you think so?

693
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:45,322
I am worried about the sexual dysfunction problem,

694
00:46:46,521 --> 00:46:48,521
but he seems like a nice guy.

695
00:46:49,021 --> 00:46:51,122
And even with that problem, his sister-in-law is an expert.

696
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:52,191
so it will be cured.

697
00:46:53,322 --> 00:46:54,691
What? "Sister-in-law"?

698
00:46:55,992 --> 00:46:58,131
I like him.

699
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:00,932
So you should try to warm up to him too.

700
00:47:03,432 --> 00:47:05,242
Gosh, it's too hot out here. Let's go.

701
00:47:06,872 --> 00:47:07,941
You take this one.

702
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,711
- Carry that one. - This one is heavier!

703
00:47:15,352 --> 00:47:16,412
Give me your hand.

704
00:47:17,622 --> 00:47:18,751
I'm okay.

705
00:47:18,852 --> 00:47:21,552
You're obviously not okay. Pricking a finger works like a charm.

706
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:23,251
But still...

707
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:25,092
- There's a UFO! - Where?

708
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:28,992
Blood! My gosh, I'm bleeding.

709
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:31,401
I'm bleeding a little.

710
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:36,131
Go in and get some rest. You're not feeling well.

711
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:38,771
It's okay. I feel totally fine now.

712
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:40,142
Please let me help.

713
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,211
It's okay. The three of us can do it.

714
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:45,142
Then can you knead this dough?

715
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:49,282
Our dad usually does this, but he couldn't come due to an event.

716
00:47:50,211 --> 00:47:53,751
Gosh, my arm... My delicate arm is getting tired.

717
00:47:56,322 --> 00:47:57,521
Oh, sure. You can give it to me.

718
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:09,972
Mr. Lee, please be gentle.

719
00:48:14,012 --> 00:48:16,472
But I must say, my stomach feels much better now.

720
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:20,651
I'll prick your finger again next time your stomach is upset.

721
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:22,481
"Next time"?

722
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:38,162
Wait, stop.

723
00:48:46,372 --> 00:48:48,941
Then shall we go have some beer?

724
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:50,711
There's a pub right down the street.

725
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:52,012
- Let's go there, then. - Let's go.

726
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:54,912
Oh, where are you guys going?

727
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:59,021
It's starting to drizzle, so we're heading to a pub.

728
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:01,651
Then you should've called me.

729
00:49:01,651 --> 00:49:03,151
Why did I spend the money to...

730
00:49:04,461 --> 00:49:05,592
I mean,

731
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:08,932
I should just give these all to you as your housewarming gift.

732
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:14,472
- All of them?
- All right, guys. Let's go.

733
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:15,731
Let's go.

734
00:49:25,981 --> 00:49:28,481
Is it because there are no customers here? It's so quiet.

735
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:31,322
I know, right? Why aren't you guys talking?

736
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:34,392
Does anyone have an amusing story to tell?

737
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,722
What can there be? I mean, we see each other every day.

738
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:40,932
- Thank you. - Thank you.

739
00:49:41,131 --> 00:49:42,932
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

740
00:49:42,932 --> 00:49:44,302
- Hey. - Oh, hello.

741
00:49:44,302 --> 00:49:47,231
You know we're trying to get a park built near the intersection, right?

742
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,602
If you're in support of it, please sign here.

743
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:52,572
- The lady from Unit 301 is here. - Oh, hello.

744
00:49:52,771 --> 00:49:54,671
I'll need your signature here too.

745
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:56,211
You and the guy...

746
00:49:56,211 --> 00:49:58,282
in the rooftop room are the only ones who haven't signed.

747
00:49:58,682 --> 00:50:00,311
Oh, really?

748
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:03,412
- Here you go. - Great.

749
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:04,822
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

750
00:50:07,392 --> 00:50:09,352
Hey, what are you doing now?

751
00:50:09,622 --> 00:50:10,921
Why are you covering your face?

752
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,762
This is...

753
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:16,291
I got inspired by "King of Mask Singer".

754
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:19,432
- "King of Mask Singer"? - Yes.

755
00:50:20,032 --> 00:50:23,131
Mr. Jung asked us if we have anything amusing to share,

756
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:24,401
so I'd like to entertain you all...

757
00:50:25,102 --> 00:50:27,671
by singing a song for you.

758
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,271
Then I'll get started.

759
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:39,822
Can you feel my heartbeat?

760
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:43,122
Listen to my heartbeat, it's beating for you

761
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:46,122
Listen to my heartbeat, it's waiting for you

762
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:49,392
It still doesn't know that we're through

763
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:50,802
I can't understand why

764
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:52,102
Stop, stop!

765
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:54,331
Why... Why are you telling me to stop?

766
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:58,041
I get that you want to go up the ladder, but do you have to do this?

767
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:01,012
What do you mean, sir? "Go up the ladder"?

768
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:03,142
I bet you heard that working...

769
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:06,142
in our department is like a free ticket to getting promoted.

770
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:08,512
That's probably why you want to transfer to our department.

771
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:12,052
"Whom should I curry favor with to make that happen?"

772
00:51:13,052 --> 00:51:16,651
After thinking for a while, you eventually decided that...

773
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:20,561
you need to win me over because I'm the most influential one.

774
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,262
Aren't I right?

775
00:51:23,932 --> 00:51:25,461
Gosh, no way.

776
00:51:25,561 --> 00:51:26,631
What? "No way"?

777
00:51:29,102 --> 00:51:31,501
I went to Kori University.

778
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:34,912
I bet he wanted to let me know that we're alumni.

779
00:51:34,912 --> 00:51:36,912
Then he sang like that just now...

780
00:51:36,912 --> 00:51:39,211
to get me into a good mood.

781
00:51:40,012 --> 00:51:42,111
You're doing all this to win me over, aren't you?

782
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:44,981
Mr. Ko Gui Nam, aren't I right?

783
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:48,691
Yes, you're right, sir.

784
00:51:56,361 --> 00:51:57,961
Do you want to sing too, Mr. Yang?

785
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:01,572
Then let me sing my favorite musical a bit.

786
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:14,952
This is the moment

787
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:18,581
My final test

788
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:21,492
Destiny beckoned

789
00:52:21,492 --> 00:52:24,662
I never reckoned second best

790
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:26,521
I won't look down

791
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:30,532
I must not fall

792
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:34,231
Moment for moment

793
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:37,572
This was the moment

794
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:40,302
The greatest

795
00:52:40,302 --> 00:52:45,242
Moment of them all

796
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:57,861
- Mr. Yang, that was incredible! - Bravo!

797
00:52:58,561 --> 00:52:59,662
What just happened?

798
00:53:09,572 --> 00:53:10,842
Please be careful, Ms. Bong.

799
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,541
You'd better watch out.

800
00:53:16,972 --> 00:53:19,012
What do you mean?

801
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:20,782
Just behave yourself.

802
00:53:21,452 --> 00:53:24,151
Don't try to seduce me by picking up my bra pads for me.

803
00:53:24,622 --> 00:53:26,182
Don't show up out of nowhere...

804
00:53:26,481 --> 00:53:29,352
and buy me three bags of sausages.

805
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:33,322
This is the moment

806
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:37,231
Don't you dare try to seduce me by singing like that.

807
00:53:50,642 --> 00:53:52,012
Why are you following me?

808
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:55,581
You seem quite drunk. I was worried that you might stumble and fall.

809
00:53:56,711 --> 00:53:58,751
You're trying to seduce me again.

810
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:01,092
Then why don't you keep me safe?

811
00:54:07,492 --> 00:54:08,831
It's so weird.

812
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:13,361
For some reason, I kind of like Mr. Yang despite my high standards.

813
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:17,541
Shall I ask him out?

814
00:54:18,642 --> 00:54:22,342
No, no. That'd be embarrassing. I mustn't ask him out first.

815
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:25,842
I have a thing called pride too. I cannot ask him out.

816
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:29,012
I must protect my pride.

817
00:54:57,238 --> 00:54:58,377
How is it?

818
00:54:58,377 --> 00:55:01,578
We made kalguksu and scallion pancakes with the clams we caught.

819
00:55:01,877 --> 00:55:03,107
Isn't everything so good?

820
00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:07,118
Yes, I'll make sure I attend this event again next year.

821
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:09,587
It's too early to say that.

822
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:11,517
Right.

823
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:15,828
By the way, do you catch clams here...

824
00:55:15,828 --> 00:55:17,857
on your vacation every summer?

825
00:55:18,158 --> 00:55:20,797
Yes, our dad usually joins us too. We catch clams and hang out.

826
00:55:22,198 --> 00:55:24,038
That's a pretty unique family tradition.

827
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:25,368
Is it?

828
00:55:30,778 --> 00:55:32,408
We made a promise to our mom.

829
00:55:33,178 --> 00:55:34,278
A promise?

830
00:55:35,477 --> 00:55:37,718
It was when Mi So was four.

831
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:42,948
Our dad wanted to participate in the Beach Music Festival.

832
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:44,988
So we borrowed our neighbor's car,

833
00:55:45,158 --> 00:55:46,857
and all of us were on our way there together.

834
00:55:50,558 --> 00:55:52,258
As long as there's music I love,

835
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:56,727
cool breeze, and my family is with me,

836
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,667
I can go anywhere. Cause I

837
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:05,408
Already know

838
00:56:05,508 --> 00:56:08,578
Dad, why are you such a bad singer?

839
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:10,718
What do you mean?

840
00:56:10,718 --> 00:56:14,247
Why do you say that? Daddy's got an amazing voice.

841
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:15,988
Yes. Of course.

842
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:19,857
I am going to make sure to win today and give Mommy a trophy...

843
00:56:20,017 --> 00:56:21,288
as her birthday present.

844
00:56:21,428 --> 00:56:23,758
And during the award acceptance speech,

845
00:56:24,227 --> 00:56:25,528
I will...

846
00:56:26,127 --> 00:56:28,167
shout your name.

847
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:31,267
Please make it happen.

848
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,968
It's a beach.

849
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:36,107
- It's a beach. - It's a beach.

850
00:56:36,107 --> 00:56:37,877
It's cool and pretty.

851
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:43,377
We still have time.

852
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:45,977
Can't we stop by the beach?

853
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:47,888
Of course we can.

854
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:50,357
Girls, do you want to stop by the beach?

855
00:56:50,357 --> 00:56:52,357
- Yes! - Yes!

856
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:14,107
Catch me.

857
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:17,778
Let's get...

858
00:57:23,047 --> 00:57:25,158
What's wrong? Did you lose something?

859
00:57:26,058 --> 00:57:28,058
- My car key. - What?

860
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:42,167
I am such a bad husband.

861
00:57:43,008 --> 00:57:45,477
I wanted to give you a trophy for your birthday,

862
00:57:45,477 --> 00:57:46,707
but I got you worried instead.

863
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:51,247
This is your worst birthday, isn't it?

864
00:57:51,517 --> 00:57:54,917
No, it's not. You must be sorry that you missed the singing contest.

865
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:57,488
I found it. Mi So found it.

866
00:57:57,488 --> 00:57:59,158
Did you really? Really?

867
00:58:03,957 --> 00:58:07,028
You didn't find the car key. You found a clam.

868
00:58:07,198 --> 00:58:09,227
Yes. It's my first time seeing a clam.

869
00:58:09,267 --> 00:58:11,297
Let's cook something delicious with it.

870
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,167
We would need some more to do that.

871
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:19,538
Girls, should we catch clams and play together?

872
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:21,107
- Yes! - Yes!

873
00:58:22,948 --> 00:58:24,047
- Let's go. - Let's go.

874
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:30,147
I am sorry.

875
00:58:30,788 --> 00:58:33,457
You should keep looking for the key. I will play with the kids.

876
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:35,158
No.

877
00:58:35,788 --> 00:58:37,698
Michael J. Fox said this.

878
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:41,267
"Family is not an important thing. It's everything."

879
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:44,468
I can call the insurance company to get the car.

880
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:46,297
I can join the singing contest next year.

881
00:58:46,468 --> 00:58:49,008
Today, I will focus my attention solely on my everything,

882
00:58:49,038 --> 00:58:51,038
my family.

883
00:58:52,578 --> 00:58:54,107
Can you really do that?

884
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:55,377
Of course I can.

885
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:57,747
I've been busy, and I haven't been able to go away with the kids.

886
00:58:58,678 --> 00:59:00,587
Perhaps this happened...

887
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,258
so that our family can have a great time together.

888
00:59:06,888 --> 00:59:08,888
You are not a bad husband.

889
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:11,098
And this is not my worst birthday.

890
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:14,468
Thanks to you, our family...

891
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,928
is having a great time together.

892
00:59:16,797 --> 00:59:18,968
Famous heavy metal vocalist...

893
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:20,837
Rob Halford said...

894
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,678
I have to pee!

895
00:59:25,337 --> 00:59:26,638
I have to pee.

896
00:59:26,808 --> 00:59:30,178
Your daughter says, "I have to pee."

897
00:59:32,147 --> 00:59:35,087
Yes. Let's go. Daddy will take you.

898
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,658
Should we come here on my birthday every year?

899
00:59:45,658 --> 00:59:48,267
Really? I love it!

900
00:59:50,368 --> 00:59:54,038
Mom kept the promise until the year after that...

901
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:55,538
and passed away.

902
00:59:57,477 --> 00:59:58,778
Wait.

903
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:01,308
Then is today...

904
01:00:01,747 --> 01:00:03,718
It's Mom's birthday.

905
01:00:06,817 --> 01:00:09,788
We remember Mom...

906
01:00:09,788 --> 01:00:11,517
clearly.

907
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:14,788
Mi So was young when it happened,

908
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:17,227
so I am sure she doesn't remember much about Mom.

909
01:00:18,058 --> 01:00:20,698
That always makes me sad.

910
01:00:23,528 --> 01:00:25,968
I apologize if I made you feel bad today.

911
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:29,667
After spending some time together, I can tell that you are a good man.

912
01:00:29,707 --> 01:00:31,278
And you clearly like Mi So a lot.

913
01:00:33,578 --> 01:00:34,778
But...

914
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:38,877
since Mi So lost her mom at such a young age,

915
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,988
I want her to start a lovely family and be loved a lot.

916
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:45,788
That's why I was worried about being with someone...

917
01:00:45,788 --> 01:00:47,627
who is not so ordinary.

918
01:00:50,758 --> 01:00:52,658
I will make sure that there is nothing for you to worry about.

919
01:00:53,357 --> 01:00:57,238
I want Ms. Kim to be happy as much as you do.

920
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:13,718
You don't remember...

921
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:15,788
any of the features of the woman who kidnapped us?

922
01:01:15,788 --> 01:01:17,988
You don't have any memories of how we escaped either?

923
01:01:17,988 --> 01:01:18,988
Nothing at all?

924
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:22,058
Which one of these two is you, Sung Yeon?

925
01:01:40,178 --> 01:01:43,377
I don't know how it might sound to you.

926
01:01:44,348 --> 01:01:47,888
I think that boy "Hyun" is Mr. Lee.

927
01:01:54,457 --> 01:01:56,227
What are you doing here all by yourself?

928
01:02:01,598 --> 01:02:04,538
What's wrong with your face?

929
01:02:05,267 --> 01:02:08,038
What is it? Is something wrong?

930
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:11,707
Honey.

931
01:02:12,808 --> 01:02:14,178
I think...

932
01:02:14,977 --> 01:02:17,848
it's about time we tell kids the truth.

933
01:02:19,678 --> 01:02:20,817
What?

934
01:02:21,187 --> 01:02:23,348
I don't think I can keep it a secret any longer.

935
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:43,707
I think I won their approval to a certain degree.

936
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:45,337
Right.

937
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,078
I'm happier now than when I was picked...

938
01:02:47,078 --> 01:02:49,278
as the most influential CEO in his 30s.

939
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,388
But I feel a little bad.

940
01:02:58,218 --> 01:03:00,457
If I knew it was such an important day to your family,

941
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:01,727
I wouldn't have come.

942
01:03:02,758 --> 01:03:05,528
You should be spending a meaningful time with your family.

943
01:03:07,227 --> 01:03:08,428
No.

944
01:03:08,797 --> 01:03:12,267
I was really glad that you came...

945
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,667
and you worked hard for me.

946
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:17,638
My sisters realized that you are such a great person.

947
01:03:17,638 --> 01:03:18,808
So they must've been glad too.

948
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:24,718
My family becomes the saddest we can when it's the day she passed.

949
01:03:24,747 --> 01:03:27,247
On her birthday, we become the happiest.

950
01:03:27,988 --> 01:03:30,988
I think your family is very lovely.

951
01:03:31,288 --> 01:03:34,687
Of course, I am sure your mother was a good person too.

952
01:03:35,727 --> 01:03:38,997
Right. She was a very good person.

953
01:03:42,868 --> 01:03:46,167
Shortly after we came to this beach,

954
01:03:47,138 --> 01:03:49,707
my mom, who used to be healthy, suddenly collapsed.

955
01:03:52,377 --> 01:03:55,707
My dad was always in the hospital taking care of her.

956
01:03:57,377 --> 01:04:00,278
So I was always alone.

957
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:05,218
Looking at other kids playing with their moms,

958
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,357
I became so envious.

959
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:16,198
And one day...

960
01:04:17,797 --> 01:04:20,607
Come on. Play with me.

961
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:26,377
Please give it to me. Pour it here.

962
01:04:28,078 --> 01:04:29,278
Mi So.

963
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:32,547
Mom!

964
01:04:39,857 --> 01:04:40,957
Mom.

965
01:04:41,758 --> 01:04:45,058
Let's play a catching game with me. You catch me, Mom.

966
01:04:45,428 --> 01:04:46,968
- Should I do that? - Yes.

967
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:49,567
Okay. Go.

968
01:04:57,437 --> 01:04:59,437
I was so happy that Mom came.

969
01:05:00,808 --> 01:05:02,377
I was so happy.

970
01:05:06,718 --> 01:05:09,647
I found out later that she was on the way home after hearing...

971
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:12,558
that there's nothing they could do for her at the hospital.

972
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:18,558
It must've been so tough for her...

973
01:05:18,897 --> 01:05:20,627
to run around with her sick body.

974
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:26,167
But...

975
01:05:27,408 --> 01:05:29,207
without that memory,

976
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:32,408
I might have forgotten Mom.

977
01:05:33,707 --> 01:05:35,178
I was too little,

978
01:05:35,607 --> 01:05:38,047
and Mom and I didn't share many memories.

979
01:05:41,547 --> 01:05:42,687
I see.

980
01:05:43,988 --> 01:05:45,118
So...

981
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:48,928
if there's a painful memory you cannot easily talk about,

982
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:53,227
I hope one day you will tell me about it.

983
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,337
Whenever that day may be, I will wait for that day.

984
01:05:59,238 --> 01:06:03,638
I will always be there for you.

985
01:06:29,397 --> 01:06:31,567
It would be nice if you spend some more time here.

986
01:06:31,767 --> 01:06:33,968
I told you. We have a showcase at lunch.

987
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:37,477
I will officially introduce myself next time.

988
01:06:38,008 --> 01:06:39,238
Take your time and have fun.

989
01:06:39,308 --> 01:06:40,547
Take care on the way home.

990
01:06:40,848 --> 01:06:42,908
Please take good care of Mi So.

991
01:06:43,178 --> 01:06:45,017
- Okay. - I'll go now.

992
01:07:00,968 --> 01:07:02,767
You don't look well.

993
01:07:02,868 --> 01:07:04,198
What is it about?

994
01:07:06,297 --> 01:07:08,038
Don't be confused.

995
01:07:10,377 --> 01:07:11,837
Don't suffer...

996
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:15,147
from the feeling of guilt either.

997
01:07:17,717 --> 01:07:20,387
Now, listen to me carefully.

998
01:07:23,658 --> 01:07:25,017
24 years ago,

999
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:27,028
that day...

1000
01:07:45,082 --> 01:07:46,443
24 years ago,

1001
01:07:47,353 --> 01:07:48,412
that day...

1002
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:51,582
The person who got kidnapped that day...

1003
01:07:53,422 --> 01:07:54,622
wasn't you.

1004
01:07:58,893 --> 01:08:00,063
It was me.

1005
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:02,762
I certainly...

1006
01:08:04,433 --> 01:08:06,233
I certainly went through it.

1007
01:08:11,943 --> 01:08:15,542
This is the revolutionary software.

1008
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,342
It's the MI analysis tool.

1009
01:08:17,412 --> 01:08:19,983
Introducing B Data.

1010
01:08:22,813 --> 01:08:24,183
(VIP)

1011
01:08:34,493 --> 01:08:35,933
What are you enjoying so much?

1012
01:08:36,433 --> 01:08:37,433
My goodness.

1013
01:08:37,903 --> 01:08:39,533
I am sorry. I was a little hungry.

1014
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:41,733
Did you finish taking the photographs?

1015
01:08:41,973 --> 01:08:43,002
Yes. Finally it's over.

1016
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:45,143
It's complicated and hectic.

1017
01:08:45,802 --> 01:08:47,573
I want to go home, get washed up, and rest.

1018
01:08:47,973 --> 01:08:49,212
It will be all done after the congratulatory performance.

1019
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:50,842
So you need to just endure it a little longer.

1020
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:52,613
There's nothing after this, right?

1021
01:08:52,783 --> 01:08:54,582
I thought you'd be tired from all the outside work,

1022
01:08:54,582 --> 01:08:56,613
so I left your afternoon empty. Don't worry.

1023
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:58,353
You are always so great, Ms. Kim.

1024
01:08:59,823 --> 01:09:01,052
Mr. Lee.

1025
01:09:05,092 --> 01:09:06,592
Take a seat there and take rest.

1026
01:09:06,592 --> 01:09:07,592
Okay.

1027
01:09:08,993 --> 01:09:10,063
This way, sir.

1028
01:09:13,033 --> 01:09:16,273
Now, there will be a special performance commemorating...

1029
01:09:16,273 --> 01:09:17,643
the showcase of the new software.

1030
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:22,073
Magician Charming Choi's magic show will begin now.

1031
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:24,912
Please welcome him.

1032
01:10:01,653 --> 01:10:02,853
How did you come here?

1033
01:10:07,292 --> 01:10:09,552
She said my memory is wrong.

1034
01:10:13,493 --> 01:10:15,363
Do you agree?

1035
01:10:24,042 --> 01:10:25,603
Is it such a tough question...

1036
01:10:27,512 --> 01:10:28,872
to answer?

1037
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:33,752
We have a special guest...

1038
01:10:33,752 --> 01:10:35,052
who will make the show shine.

1039
01:10:35,052 --> 01:10:37,622
Let's bring in the model Kim Na Yeon.

1040
01:10:56,073 --> 01:10:57,103
Does it mean...

1041
01:10:58,273 --> 01:10:59,443
my memory...

1042
01:11:00,342 --> 01:11:01,773
is wrong?

1043
01:11:09,252 --> 01:11:10,422
I sometimes...

1044
01:11:12,252 --> 01:11:13,552
dreamed of my childhood...

1045
01:11:14,323 --> 01:11:15,752
which I couldn't understand the meaning of.

1046
01:11:17,592 --> 01:11:18,662
If ever...

1047
01:11:19,393 --> 01:11:20,493
If ever...

1048
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:23,162
If the memory is...

1049
01:11:23,162 --> 01:11:24,563
Your father's gone to work.

1050
01:11:25,002 --> 01:11:26,563
What nonsense are you talking about?

1051
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:28,933
Auntie's gone strange.

1052
01:11:30,573 --> 01:11:33,002
No, Mi So. She's not your auntie.

1053
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:35,073
- It's a spider. It's a big spider. - Hey...

1054
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:37,283
I am scared.

1055
01:11:37,313 --> 01:11:39,212
Mi So. Stay there.

1056
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:40,752
Don't come here.

1057
01:11:40,955 --> 01:11:42,613
No, don't go.

1058
01:11:42,912 --> 01:11:45,252
Don't leave me alone here.

1059
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:46,783
Don't come near me, you idiot.

1060
01:11:55,893 --> 01:11:57,063
I remembered.

1061
01:12:04,342 --> 01:12:05,403
Mi So.

1062
01:12:05,872 --> 01:12:08,012
Mi So. Wake up. Mi So.

1063
01:12:08,512 --> 01:12:09,613
Kim Mi So.

1064
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:16,212
Mi So, wake up.

1065
01:12:16,552 --> 01:12:17,582
Mi So.

1066
01:12:19,082 --> 01:12:20,183
Mi So!

1067
01:12:52,153 --> 01:12:54,393
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

1068
01:13:00,863 --> 01:13:02,132
Do you know who I am?

1069
01:13:08,502 --> 01:13:09,872
What did you tell Mi So?

1070
01:13:10,273 --> 01:13:11,973
Why did she suddenly collapse?

1071
01:13:19,512 --> 01:13:22,353
There is nothing you can hide forever in the world.
