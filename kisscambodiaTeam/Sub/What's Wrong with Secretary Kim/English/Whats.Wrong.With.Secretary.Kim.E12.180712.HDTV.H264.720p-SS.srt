1
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:13,206
Who is it?

2
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:14,946
It's me.

3
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:18,635
Mr. Lee?

4
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:24,405
Why are you back?

5
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:26,126
Because you said no.

6
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,345
Sorry?

7
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:29,345
You said you don't want to go to my place,

8
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:31,525
so I'm going to sleep at your place...

9
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:35,816
I mean I'm going to live at your place.

10
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,155
Let's sleep together tonight.

11
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:43,685
Sleep together?

12
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:47,155
What nonsense are you talking about?

13
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,326
Why is it nonsense?

14
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:52,596
It's nonsense. You want to...

15
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:56,636
You want to move in.

16
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:02,405
I'll stay only for a few days, so it won't be a move-in.

17
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:05,076
It will be a temporary move-in. So to speak.

18
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:07,175
What is the temporary move-in?

19
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:10,045
And my flat is a studio, so I only have one room.

20
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,056
We can't sleep together.

21
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:12,785
That's why I asked you to go to my place since I have...

22
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:14,485
a plenty of rooms, but you refused.

23
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:19,056
- That's true. - Then will you make a way?

24
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:21,795
It will take a while to unpack all of these.

25
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:29,205
What do I do? What do I do?

26
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:31,106
All right.

27
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,616
How can you just go inside...

28
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,515
You don't have many shoes.

29
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:47,955
Thanks to you, I will have enough space.

30
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,576
I know this space very well.

31
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:14,386
That's enough closet space.

32
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,786
The vanity is spacious too.

33
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:23,786
By any chance, do you seek a minimal life?

34
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:27,265
Do you only live with the bare minimum of things?

35
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,895
I simply couldn't afford to shop because I had to pay back my debts.

36
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,096
Are you nervous?

37
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,166
Because we are going to be together tonight?

38
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:08,936
That's not it.

39
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,506
Right. Don't be nervous.

40
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,275
My purpose of being here tonight is...

41
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:30,256
to protect you by your side so you will sleep comfortably.

42
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:33,455
That's all.

43
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:43,036
I prepared something to help you have a good sleep.

44
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:46,906
It's...

45
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:50,045
the finest foot bath soap which contains salt from the Dead Sea.

46
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:51,946
Foot bath soap?

47
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:54,386
When you have a foot bath, your feet become warm...

48
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:56,245
and the circulation of your energy and blood is facilitated.

49
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:58,115
It also discharges the waste and toxin in your body...

50
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,156
and helps you have a good sleep.

51
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:04,395
Shall we have a foot bath now?

52
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,055
Yes.

53
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:07,295
Let's go.

54
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,006
This is very different from what I imagined.

55
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,835
I am sorry. I don't have a bath tub.

56
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:32,455
You look very uncomfortable.

57
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:34,886
I am not uncomfortable. I'm just not used to it.

58
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:37,155
What I am really uncomfortable about...

59
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:40,025
is you feeling scared without me.

60
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:43,895
So don't worry about me and try to relax with the foot bath.

61
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:48,665
Whether we use a bucket or a bath tub, it will have the same effect.

62
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:51,736
Okay.

63
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:04,355
How did it happen?

64
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,085
The water pressure is great.

65
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:11,256
Thank you.

66
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:15,465
Does the toilet get clogged often?

67
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:17,996
Of course not.

68
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,405
How do you feel? Can you feel the improvement...

69
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:25,736
in your energy and blood circulation?

70
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,345
Do you think the discharge of waste and toxin in your body...

71
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:28,946
will help you have a sound sleep?

72
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:33,215
Yes.

73
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:36,645
It's really great. I think I am going to sleep like a baby tonight.

74
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,085
That's good.

75
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:41,955
Now, shall we go to bed?

76
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,736
Good night.

77
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:11,655
Good night, Ms. Kim.

78
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:17,225
Why are you looking at me like that?

79
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,926
Why are you lying down beside me?

80
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:23,225
Then...

81
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:25,296
where would I go?

82
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:28,705
Then are we going to sleep like this?

83
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:31,936
Of course.

84
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:34,376
This is the only bed you have.

85
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,546
That's true, but...

86
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:42,746
Since you provided me a comfortable bed,

87
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,285
I will provide you a pillow.

88
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:46,986
I already have a pillow.

89
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,256
That not the pillow I'm talking about.

90
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,455
I prepared a special pillow which will help you sleep tight.

91
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,496
It's my arm.

92
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:29,395
What...

93
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,095
What are you doing?

94
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:35,736
I don't feel sleepy anymore. Let's watch some TV.

95
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:38,806
Well...

96
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:42,145
It is a good angle to watch TV from.

97
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:43,806
But you want to watch it at this hour?

98
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:45,515
Yes.

99
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:50,515
What was the movie channel? Wait.

100
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:54,155
There it is.

101
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:10,436
Soccer.

102
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:13,236
Europe... Premier League. Should we watch this?

103
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:20,785
Is that funny?

104
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:27,725
Ms. Kim, do you feel uncomfortable to be in the same bed with me?

105
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,826
It's not that I feel uncomfortable.

106
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,125
It's a little awkward.

107
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,865
I strangely feel nervous, so I won't be able to fall asleep.

108
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,215
Then let's have some wine.

109
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:57,355
Wine?

110
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,026
Wine lowers your body temperature and stimulates sleep hormone,

111
00:09:01,026 --> 00:09:02,786
so it helps you have a good sleep.

112
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,196
Okay.

113
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,566
But I don't have wine at home.

114
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,365
I expected that much.

115
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,266
So I brought it.

116
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,406
(Episode 12)

117
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,475
It feels like a rooftop wine bar.

118
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:23,646
We will have a glass of wine while breathing in night air,

119
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:25,375
and we will go to bed.

120
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:28,245
It's a perfect plan.

121
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,686
It really is.

122
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,125
But where's your wine key?

123
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,896
I don't have one.

124
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,135
Does that mean we can't drink this?

125
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,266
No, I know a way to open it.

126
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:51,436
I saw a method of opening a wine bottle...

127
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:53,776
without a wine key on a TV show once.

128
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,146
You've become funnier, Mi So.

129
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,345
How could one do that without a wine key?

130
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:05,516
By magic?

131
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,656
No, just by trick.

132
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,625
Could you lend me your shoe, please?

133
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:13,625
My...

134
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,735
Fine, I'll give it a try.

135
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:21,306
Thank you.

136
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,375
Give me just a moment.

137
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:31,516
First you do this.

138
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:41,985
What... What are you doing, Ms. Kim?

139
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,595
The cork will pop out if I do this.

140
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:45,796
Give me just a moment.

141
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,095
My apologies.

142
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:54,166
- Ms. Kim, did you know? - Know what?

143
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:57,406
That's a 20,000-dollar bottle of wine.

144
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:08,485
My deepest apologies.

145
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:16,085
Good job, Ms. Kim.

146
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:18,296
1757!

147
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:21,296
Whose car is the car with the plate number "1757"?

148
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:23,266
- Such rude neighbors. - 1757!

149
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,335
That person who is yelling in the middle of the night like this...

150
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,865
and the person with the plate number "1757".

151
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:28,735
Wait.

152
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:32,076
Isn't "1757"... Your plate number?

153
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:34,276
1757!

154
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:44,985
- Are you the owner of this car? - Yes.

155
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:46,715
This is a reserved parking space.

156
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:49,156
You can't just park in someone else's space like this.

157
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:50,796
I see.

158
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:52,426
Pardon me.

159
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,436
You drive such an expensive car when you live in a studio? Ridiculous.

160
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:00,635
Mr. Lee, it'd be best for you to hurry and move your car.

161
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:04,635
I only say this since you remind me of my son, and I worry for you.

162
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:08,046
People need to live within their means.

163
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:12,115
You can't be so obsessed with appearances like this.

164
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:14,316
"Appearances"?

165
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:16,585
"Obsessed"?

166
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:20,625
My son didn't care about appearances at all,

167
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,625
and only committed himself to studying hard.

168
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:26,855
Then he managed to snag a job at Yumyung Group recently.

169
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:32,166
The person in charge of Yumyung Group is me.

170
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:35,605
Goodness.

171
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,005
Don't drive if you're drunk.

172
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:41,076
You drive, young lady. Okay?

173
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,105
Goodness.

174
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:45,016
Hello, my son.

175
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,516
You're working overtime?

176
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:51,156
Why does that company work you so hard?

177
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:54,855
I wish I could see the head honcho's face, so I could scold him.

178
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,595
"Head honcho"?

179
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:58,595
Yes.

180
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:00,666
Of course.

181
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:06,095
Fine.

182
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,105
You head upstairs first and rest, Ms. Kim.

183
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:11,536
I'll move my car to a parking lot,

184
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:12,806
and buy a wine key on the way back.

185
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,546
No, you seem to be quite inconvenienced here.

186
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,916
- You should return home now... - No, I told you already.

187
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,485
I'll feel uneasy if I leave you here alone.

188
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:23,715
That's why I'm proposing that we go together.

189
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:26,556
- Let's go to your place together. - "Let's go..." Wait, what?

190
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:28,755
- My place? - Yes.

191
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:33,125
Good idea.

192
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:40,705
We could've just stayed at your place.

193
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:44,205
No, it's fine. It's small, and I don't have much there.

194
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:45,875
Thinking about how uncomfortable you'd be...

195
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,906
would keep me up all night.

196
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,516
Do you think I'm a fussy person?

197
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,516
Even if you do, I can't help it.

198
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,955
Things have been really tough for me...

199
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,026
ever since that incident.

200
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,125
But...

201
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,066
imagining you experiencing the same horrors as me...

202
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,235
makes me so worried that I can't do anything.

203
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:18,076
I understand how you feel.

204
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:23,576
That's why I suggested that we should go to your place.

205
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,965
I'll sleep in the guest room tonight.

206
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:49,465
The guest room?

207
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:51,436
Yes. Good night.

208
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,076
It's a bit scary.

209
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:45,255
Are you okay, Ms. Kim?

210
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:47,125
You surprised me.

211
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:49,166
What is it?

212
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,965
This won't work. I feel too uneasy.

213
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:57,276
Since your house is cozier,

214
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:59,335
I can see what you're doing no matter where you are.

215
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:02,245
But I can't do that at my place since it's just so big.

216
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:05,576
This is the first time feeling uncomfortable in my large home.

217
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:07,845
So?

218
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:09,646
I want to confirm that you're sleeping well...

219
00:16:10,245 --> 00:16:11,416
by keeping you by my side.

220
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:13,955
Your side?

221
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,495
There aren't any sofas in here,

222
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:20,666
and you'll be worried all night if I sleep on the floor.

223
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,766
So I'll sleep in this bed with you.

224
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,816
I know exactly what you're thinking.

225
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,556
But my head is merely full of concern for you,

226
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,355
so there's no space for me to entertain other kinds of thoughts.

227
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:49,426
So don't think about it, and get some rest.

228
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,156
Since he put it that way,

229
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:57,266
turning him down more will just make it weird, right?

230
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:25,456
Please, say something.

231
00:17:26,226 --> 00:17:27,695
What do I have to say...

232
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:29,466
to get rid of this awkwardness?

233
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:32,496
Get to work, my special brain.

234
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,236
- Ms. Kim. - Yes, Mr. Lee?

235
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,206
Want me to sing you a lullaby?

236
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,016
It's weirding me out, but please do something.

237
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,016
Yes, please do.

238
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,956
This is embarrassing, but it's better than nothing.

239
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:00,966
Sure.

240
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:04,095
I'll sing one just for you.

241
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:18,576
A...

242
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:25,556
A...

243
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:31,695
A tiring day passes by

244
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:36,425
And the shadow of two people

245
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:41,865
Merge under the moonlight

246
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:46,306
Even though

247
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,605
the faint traces of happiness

248
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:53,845
That seem

249
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:56,915
Just within my grasp

250
00:18:58,216 --> 00:19:00,216
When I close my eyes

251
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:05,256
Are still there.

252
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:23,236
When I walk with you

253
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:15,786
This is good enough for today.

254
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:06,935
Why are you awake already?

255
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,246
I stayed up all night.

256
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:11,415
Why?

257
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:15,415
I tried hard not to disturb your goodnight's sleep.

258
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:35,905
Ms. Kim.

259
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:40,175
I can't guarantee you tonight.

260
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:07,806
Oh, yes.

261
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:09,605
(Young Joon, you brat)

262
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:12,175
Oh my goodness, this little filthy devil.

263
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:13,736
- Oh, yes. - Goodness.

264
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:15,046
Go away.

265
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:16,645
(What about tonight?)

266
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,746
Go.

267
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:19,576
Go to Ms. Kim.

268
00:23:20,945 --> 00:23:22,016
Go for it.

269
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:32,326
It smells nice.

270
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:38,496
Why couldn't he sleep last night by the way?

271
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:45,175
What can't he guarantee tonight?

272
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:54,316
No way.

273
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:00,516
Gosh, it startled me.

274
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:01,855
Go away.

275
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:04,326
I haven't thought about that kind of stuff.

276
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:06,425
What do you take me for?

277
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:07,826
Go away.

278
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:20,335
(Omelet Recipe for Your Man)

279
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:31,316
(Omelet Recipe for Your Man)

280
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,326
It looked easy in the video.

281
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,665
What are you doing?

282
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:48,036
Mr. Lee.

283
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,076
Why are you cooking yourself?

284
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:05,286
I was so thankful for your caring since yesterday,

285
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:09,026
so I wanted to do something for you that I tried to make an omelet.

286
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:19,695
Is this how you return evil for good?

287
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:24,036
- I'll throw this away. - It's mine.

288
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:28,276
You made it for me, so it's mine.

289
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,445
Then let me decorate it a little.

290
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:37,615
No more touching.

291
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:44,326
Thanks for the food.

292
00:25:58,335 --> 00:25:59,335
Drink some coffee too.

293
00:25:59,335 --> 00:26:01,746
You must be tired since you couldn't sleep last night.

294
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,276
Thanks.

295
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:12,885
Gosh, should I change cups for you?

296
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:14,185
It's okay.

297
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:21,526
I think I should be careful today.

298
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:26,536
Right, it's your jinx that bad things happen...

299
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:28,206
when your cup has a crack.

300
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,185
It's good to go to work together like this.

301
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:50,695
- Are you okay? - Yes.

302
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,496
Did you sprain it?

303
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,435
You should go to the hospital before work.

304
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,236
My ankle is fine.

305
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:01,135
It's just that I scratched my heel.

306
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:03,976
Bad things happen...

307
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,276
when I scratch my heel in the morning.

308
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:12,476
What, jinx?

309
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:14,246
Right.

310
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:18,155
Something bad happens when a cup cracks for no reason.

311
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:21,056
I have a jinx of bad luck...

312
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:23,286
when I scratch my heel in the morning.

313
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,956
I don't know.

314
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:28,595
I don't trust such a thing.

315
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,335
Actually, I saw a crow on my way to work,

316
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:35,835
and I broke my cup while drinking water after coming to work.

317
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:38,875
Then I scratched my shoe on a door.

318
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:41,246
But nothing's happening.

319
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:42,806
Rather, a good thing happened.

320
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:45,046
- A good thing? - Yes.

321
00:27:45,276 --> 00:27:47,076
I just confirmed that the new medicine development...

322
00:27:47,076 --> 00:27:48,845
of Yumyung Bio went successfully.

323
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:51,385
- That's because I'm competent. - Anyway.

324
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:56,556
Jinx is all about superstition.

325
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,425
Let's not be so obsessed with it.

326
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,895
We're living in an advanced country after all.

327
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:04,966
Oh, right. Ms. Kim, let's cancel my dinner meeting today.

328
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,835
Cancel yours too.

329
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:09,335
- Why? - Kim Sung Ki...

330
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:11,435
was hospitalized due to his lung cancer in the end.

331
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:13,105
He's going to have his surgery soon.

332
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,306
What, lung cancer?

333
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:18,175
Isn't he your junior from your studying abroad?

334
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:19,516
That's right.

335
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:22,816
He fortunately found it in the early stage, so it isn't too critical.

336
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:27,016
I knew this would happen since that punk smoked so much.

337
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,526
You two should take good care about your health too like me.

338
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,966
You take care of it way too much.

339
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,895
It's better to be excessive.

340
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:37,266
Look around you.

341
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:40,966
There are so many people who died of health problems.

342
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:46,206
People tend to notice the absence more than the presence.

343
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:52,915
After my wife left me,

344
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:55,915
do you know how lonely I was?

345
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:00,516
Your story always ends with talking about your ex-wife.

346
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:06,556
Oh, he talks about his ex-wife almost every day.

347
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:08,966
You know nothing about how I feel.

348
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:14,706
Sorry, that was a bit too loud.

349
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:20,335
I mean, I rashly nitpicked her whether she got a new boyfriend...

350
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:21,546
without knowing he was her cousin.

351
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:24,615
I even lost my chance to make up with her. You know how that feels?

352
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:30,855
Right, I'm hopeless. Go without me.

353
00:29:33,415 --> 00:29:35,125
Gosh, it must be Ms. Seol.

354
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:41,925
Why aren't you picking it up?

355
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:45,296
It's my ex-wife.

356
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:54,976
Hello?

357
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:57,546
I'm calling you because I didn't feel so good...

358
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:59,845
after we parted like that yesterday.

359
00:30:00,546 --> 00:30:02,786
By any chance,

360
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,956
did you go to that restaurant because you missed me?

361
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,625
I thought I'd be able to see you if I went there.

362
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:13,966
Yoo Shik.

363
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,695
Do you have time this evening?

364
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:19,135
This evening?

365
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,806
You want to drink cocktail with me?

366
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:33,076
What are you doing?

367
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,756
Sure, let's do it.

368
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:43,385
I'm sorry, but can we meet late at night?

369
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,695
I have to go see a doctor.

370
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:47,665
A doctor?

371
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:49,996
Why? Are you sick?

372
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:52,335
Actually,

373
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,706
I have to visit a hospital because "Sung Ki" is in critical condition.

374
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:02,706
Oh, no. I didn't mean penis.

375
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:04,516
Of course, "Sung Ki" means penis in Korean,

376
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:07,345
but I'm talking about Kim Sung Ki...

377
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:09,486
who's my junior from studying abroad.

378
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:11,486
Hello? Honey!

379
00:31:21,695 --> 00:31:24,466
Crow, cracked cup, and scratch on my shoe.

380
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,966
Which one of them was my jinx?

381
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:28,806
- All of them. - All of them.

382
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:35,076
You should be good while you're together.

383
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:37,875
Don't regret after losing your partner like me.

384
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:48,899
<font color="#8080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E12 What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

385
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,165
- Was everything all right? - Yes.

386
00:31:57,635 --> 00:32:00,766
I organized the vice chairman's schedule for the next week.

387
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:03,036
- Good job. - Thanks.

388
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:06,536
I'll go to the meeting with the planning team then.

389
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:07,576
Okay.

390
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,226
It's the list of your schedule for the next week.

391
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:27,095
This isn't important now.

392
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:29,625
Do you remember what Mr. Park said earlier?

393
00:32:29,796 --> 00:32:32,566
- What exactly? - About how you should be good...

394
00:32:32,635 --> 00:32:34,635
so that you don't regret after losing your partner.

395
00:32:35,306 --> 00:32:37,576
A lot of things came to my mind after he said that.

396
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,645
What if you leave me?

397
00:32:42,776 --> 00:32:44,776
You will regret so much then.

398
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:48,486
So you should be good while I'm with you.

399
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:53,155
We should be good to each other.

400
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:56,855
I'm doing good right now, and of course, I'll do good in the future.

401
00:32:57,996 --> 00:32:59,456
Right, I admit it.

402
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:02,766
What's my lunch schedule for today?

403
00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:05,066
Your luncheon with Mr. Han of Jungyoung Group got postponed,

404
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,566
so it's currently open.

405
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:09,466
Let's have lunch together then.

406
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:11,476
I better be good to you while you're with me,

407
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:13,206
so I'm going to buy you something very delicious.

408
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:24,115
All right, let's end our meeting here for today.

409
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:27,115
- Ji Ah. - Yes?

410
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:29,486
The given papers are classified,

411
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:31,155
so make sure shred them on your way out.

412
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:32,796
Okay, I'll do it right away.

413
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,895
- Good work. - Good work.

414
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:38,195
Good work.

415
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:39,566
Hello?

416
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:41,206
Yes, Eun Jung.

417
00:33:41,806 --> 00:33:45,175
This Saturday? Of course, I'm free.

418
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:49,105
Okay, let's go to that place and eat eggs benedict together.

419
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:50,945
Gosh, it's...

420
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:53,076
Hey, hang up for a second.

421
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:54,716
Oh, no.

422
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,885
Stop, no. Come back out.

423
00:33:59,585 --> 00:34:00,786
Is something wrong?

424
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:03,456
Well...

425
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:07,496
I intended to put the classified documents in the paper shredder,

426
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:11,235
but I put the minutes in instead.

427
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,606
I have to report this to the vice chairman soon. What should I do?

428
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:19,876
Stop. Move over.

429
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,175
Let me see.

430
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:26,246
Gosh, my minutes.

431
00:34:26,246 --> 00:34:28,746
- They're completely shredded. - Calm down.

432
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:30,146
Calm down.

433
00:34:31,086 --> 00:34:34,255
I saw you scribbling down with your pen during the meeting.

434
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:35,755
Yes.

435
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:38,695
I heard the general manager didn't like the typing sound,

436
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:40,525
so I wrote things down instead.

437
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:43,295
You're that meticulous, but why did you make such a mistake?

438
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:48,706
Anyway, we just need to find pieces with a handwriting on them.

439
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,405
It might be easier than you think.

440
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:53,476
Let's find those pieces.

441
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:57,715
Okay.

442
00:34:58,615 --> 00:34:59,646
Handwriting.

443
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:07,425
I think the next one is this.

444
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:09,226
No.

445
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:11,925
Look. Here.

446
00:35:12,496 --> 00:35:13,655
Like this.

447
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:17,565
"Strategic project planning and new-growth triggers".

448
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:20,565
It makes sense this way.

449
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:23,976
You have to know...

450
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:28,275
it's possible all due to my full understanding about the meeting.

451
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:31,215
Right, you're really incredible.

452
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:34,186
Gosh, don't mention it.

453
00:35:38,056 --> 00:35:39,556
Here, it's done.

454
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:42,655
Thank you.

455
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:48,726
Actually, I...

456
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,635
get stressed out, working under...

457
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:53,536
my perfect senior.

458
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:56,536
I want to do a good job, but it doesn't always go as I want.

459
00:35:58,036 --> 00:36:00,746
And I ended up making such a ridiculous mistake.

460
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:04,115
I was worried how should I report about what happened.

461
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:10,416
Thank you so much for helping me like this.

462
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:15,155
Well...

463
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:17,956
We have to help each other as neighbors.

464
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:24,396
Wait. Oh, gosh.

465
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:26,766
It's been smudged.

466
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:29,306
How much have we decided...

467
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,876
to increase the budget for research and development?

468
00:36:32,076 --> 00:36:33,905
- It's 5.8 percent. - 5...

469
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:36,876
- What? - We decided to increase it by 5.8.

470
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:43,045
You even remember the details?

471
00:36:44,155 --> 00:36:45,456
That's not hard.

472
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:48,856
Well, then. I have to go back to work.

473
00:36:50,226 --> 00:36:51,226
Please excuse me.

474
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:54,065
Thank you.

475
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:01,635
There's a reason why he's the most wanted man.

476
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:14,985
Thank you.

477
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:20,215
It's caramel.

478
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:25,255
Do you like caramel that much?

479
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:28,425
It's very meaningful for me.

480
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:31,266
Meaningful?

481
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:33,865
When I was young,

482
00:37:34,036 --> 00:37:37,476
you gave me the last piece of caramel candy for me.

483
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:41,476
I was reminded of that moment from time to time.

484
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:45,146
Your kindness came to me as a comfort.

485
00:37:51,155 --> 00:37:53,115
By the way, I have a question.

486
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:01,766
Why did you change your name...

487
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,036
from Lee Sung Hyun?

488
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:10,635
And...

489
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,376
how did your brother come to have the twisted memory?

490
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:26,755
You don't have to tell me now.

491
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:30,456
We have a lot of days left to spend together, so take your time.

492
00:38:34,865 --> 00:38:37,795
Oh, right. We have to go somewhere after this.

493
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:39,836
Go somewhere?

494
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,336
Yes.

495
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:47,646
We only have 10 minutes before our lunchtime ends.

496
00:38:47,646 --> 00:38:49,876
I hope we have about three lunch hours.

497
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,545
Tell me about it.

498
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:54,215
Did you hear that Ms. Choi from the marketing team...

499
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,416
and Mr. Kim from the general administration team are going out?

500
00:38:56,845 --> 00:38:57,916
Are you serious?

501
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:00,115
They must be so happy.

502
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:02,786
I'm so envious.

503
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:05,295
Go ahead and date...

504
00:39:05,295 --> 00:39:07,695
with that super hero whom you're flirting with.

505
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,365
That man?

506
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,436
Is he really going to save the Earth or what?

507
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,565
He's not saying anything.

508
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:16,235
- Still? - Gosh, whatever.

509
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:17,775
What's going on?

510
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:18,976
- I told you to write a report... - Yes?

511
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,905
- on your business trip this day. - Right, I did.

512
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,505
- Did you do it? - Yes.

513
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:25,916
By the way, can't you settle my report from the other day?

514
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:34,786
Mr. Yang, are you just having a burger for lunch?

515
00:39:36,086 --> 00:39:39,326
I heard Mr. Lee has a private lunch meeting today.

516
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:46,396
(Olive Old, everything 50 percent off except accessories)

517
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:51,376
Oh, my goodness.

518
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:53,945
This is driving me crazy.

519
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:55,076
What's wrong?

520
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:56,905
This guy I know, who lives in my neighborhood,

521
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:59,476
keeps asking me out for a meal.

522
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:02,845
I've told him that I'm busy, but he's not giving up.

523
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:04,786
Really?

524
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:07,326
My smart brain's speculation is that...

525
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,456
he probably likes you.

526
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:11,126
You think so?

527
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,396
- Does he like me? - Hey, isn't it so obvious?

528
00:40:14,396 --> 00:40:18,195
He's definitely doing that for a reason.

529
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,565
I bet he wants you to buy an insurance package.

530
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:24,905
He sounds very persistent.

531
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:27,476
He's like an insurance agent determined to get a new client.

532
00:40:28,405 --> 00:40:30,646
- He's an insurance agent, right? - No, he isn't.

533
00:40:30,916 --> 00:40:33,775
He must be doing this because he knows that I'm single.

534
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:35,916
If someone confesses his feelings to me,

535
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,615
and if I no longer have to be single,

536
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:41,356
then guys like him won't bother me anymore.

537
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:47,155
How can you drink your soda now?

538
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:51,635
Goodness, Mr. Yang almost choked.

539
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:52,666
What was that about?

540
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,365
Why did you yell at him out of the blue?

541
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:56,005
Well...

542
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:58,376
I like soda too.

543
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:00,876
I got mad because he was drinking it alone.

544
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:04,275
My goodness.

545
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:06,476
For goodness' sake.

546
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:08,086
What's the matter with her?

547
00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:10,086
She must like soda a lot.

548
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:24,065
I envy people who are dating their co-workers.

549
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:25,996
Gosh, forget it.

550
00:41:26,536 --> 00:41:28,766
Things will get so awkward after breaking up.

551
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:31,936
I'd never date my co-worker even if someone forced me to.

552
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:33,405
Gosh.

553
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:40,115
What... What's this?

554
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:41,985
Don't share it with anyone.

555
00:41:45,115 --> 00:41:46,155
Drink it all by yourself.

556
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:48,885
You have to.

557
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:53,795
What?

558
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:56,695
Did he get me this bottle of soda because I yelled at him earlier?

559
00:41:58,565 --> 00:41:59,996
I never asked him for this.

560
00:42:01,865 --> 00:42:03,635
But why did he tell me not to share it?

561
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:14,186
Ms. Bong.

562
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:20,255
You're cute.

563
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:32,595
Would you be my girlfriend?

564
00:42:34,806 --> 00:42:35,865
Oh, my goodness.

565
00:42:39,606 --> 00:42:41,146
What is this about?

566
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:59,556
So you wanted to bring me to one of our competitors?

567
00:42:59,795 --> 00:43:01,425
Why? For market research?

568
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,735
No, it's not that. There's something we need, but I figured...

569
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:06,865
everyone at our department store will get nervous if you show up.

570
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:09,905
By the way, what do we need?

571
00:43:11,076 --> 00:43:12,106
They're over there.

572
00:43:20,376 --> 00:43:21,545
What do you think about this?

573
00:43:21,545 --> 00:43:24,115
I want to buy you a pretty mug as a gift.

574
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:25,856
As a gift?

575
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:29,126
I felt bad about breaking one this morning.

576
00:43:29,425 --> 00:43:30,826
I want to buy you a pretty one...

577
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:32,996
that will bring you good luck.

578
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:36,025
Please pack this up for us.

579
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:38,166
Sure, no problem.

580
00:43:38,735 --> 00:43:41,865
A dinnerware set just came out from the same line.

581
00:43:41,865 --> 00:43:43,005
Would you like to see it too?

582
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:44,806
It's popular among newlywed couples.

583
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:47,345
- "Newlywed couples"? - We'll definitely buy that set.

584
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:48,945
No, it's okay. We'll just get the mugs.

585
00:43:49,076 --> 00:43:50,476
Okay, no problem.

586
00:43:51,646 --> 00:43:52,646
Why?

587
00:43:52,646 --> 00:43:55,186
I want to buy the dinnerware set that newlywed couples like.

588
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,516
Buying unnecessary stuff isn't a wise thing to do.

589
00:43:57,516 --> 00:43:59,016
Why do you think that it's unnecessary?

590
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:02,056
We're kind of living together now,

591
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:03,956
so we're just like a newlywed couple.

592
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:06,025
Can you please not say that?

593
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:07,266
I'm afraid that someone might hear us.

594
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:10,365
A newlywed couple? A dinnerware set?

595
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:13,195
I told you. We're not getting one.

596
00:44:18,275 --> 00:44:19,536
A newlywed couple and a dinnerware set.

597
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:22,905
It's strange though.

598
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:26,315
I think I just got scolded, but it doesn't feel so bad.

599
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:31,655
I love them.

600
00:44:32,186 --> 00:44:34,126
But you should put them back in the bag now.

601
00:44:34,126 --> 00:44:35,626
No. I want to admire them more.

602
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:37,396
Oh, right.

603
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:40,255
I thought hard about your jinx...

604
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:42,095
and have come up with a few solutions.

605
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:43,695
Solutions?

606
00:44:43,695 --> 00:44:47,036
First, I can make all employees only wear running shoes.

607
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:50,135
Then you'll never have to wear high heels,

608
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:51,675
which means they'll never get scratched.

609
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:54,606
All employees only wearing running shoes?

610
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:57,376
I think it's a bit too much.

611
00:44:58,215 --> 00:45:00,576
Second, I can try to minimize the amount of walking you have to do.

612
00:45:00,985 --> 00:45:02,385
To ensure my girlfriend's safety,

613
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:04,586
I'll provide you with your own car and a personal driver.

614
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:08,326
Oh, right. I hope you don't sell the car like you did last time.

615
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:13,655
I think that's also a bit too much.

616
00:45:14,095 --> 00:45:17,635
Third, I can buy you a new pair of shoes as a gift as well.

617
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:20,635
I want you to wear new and pretty shoes,

618
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,306
which will bring you good luck.

619
00:45:23,135 --> 00:45:24,836
I think the third one is the best solution.

620
00:45:27,945 --> 00:45:31,115
Let's not let those jinx bog us down.

621
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:34,215
Everything will be fine because we're together now.

622
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:40,885
All right. Shall we go get you new pair of shoes now?

623
00:45:40,885 --> 00:45:42,255
I'll buy you everything you like.

624
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:45,795
I told you. It's not wise to buy stuff that is not necessary.

625
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:48,326
I'm only going to get just one pair. Are we clear?

626
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,766
All right.

627
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:53,595
I promise you that I won't behave like one of those typical rich guys.

628
00:46:04,876 --> 00:46:08,146
Ms. Kim. Ms. Kim, please...

629
00:46:10,615 --> 00:46:12,516
I was just about to call you.

630
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,686
Mr. Chairman and Ms. Choi are here.

631
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:37,175
Ji Ah, I'm supposed to go into the PR team's meeting.

632
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:38,945
Could you join the meeting in my place?

633
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:40,945
You just have to take meeting minutes.

634
00:46:42,445 --> 00:46:43,885
Sure, I'll do that.

635
00:46:47,385 --> 00:46:48,686
- I'll be back in a bit. - Thank you.

636
00:47:07,306 --> 00:47:10,775
Young Joon, Sung Yeon told us...

637
00:47:11,815 --> 00:47:15,646
that you didn't actually lose your memories from that time.

638
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:17,655
Is it true?

639
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:32,936
You were so mature and thoughtful even as a kid.

640
00:47:33,695 --> 00:47:37,336
When you told us that you only lost your memories from that day,

641
00:47:38,976 --> 00:47:41,775
I should've doubted it.

642
00:47:43,376 --> 00:47:45,315
No, it's my fault.

643
00:47:47,246 --> 00:47:48,885
When you tell me...

644
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:51,586
getting Sung Yeon hospitalized,

645
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:55,186
I shouldn't have been so stubborn.

646
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:59,095
It's all my fault.

647
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:02,095
Young Joon.

648
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:05,936
Can you tell us exactly what happened?

649
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:10,306
How did you come up with such an idea?

650
00:48:11,005 --> 00:48:13,275
Tell us about the situation.

651
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:18,045
I'm ashamed to be asking you this, but I want to know.

652
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:30,622
How did you come up with such an idea?

653
00:48:31,323 --> 00:48:33,582
Tell us about the situation.

654
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:38,363
I'm ashamed to be asking you this, but I want to know.

655
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:53,912
What is this?

656
00:48:54,113 --> 00:48:55,742
I told you there's no amusement park here.

657
00:48:56,472 --> 00:48:57,843
We're almost there.

658
00:48:57,843 --> 00:48:59,412
Tae Cheol said he saw it.

659
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:00,852
I told you. I bet he lied to you.

660
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:03,312
I heard they haven't purchased the land yet.

661
00:49:04,952 --> 00:49:06,253
I'm just going to head back home.

662
00:49:09,323 --> 00:49:11,093
You gave the driver the slip with me.

663
00:49:11,562 --> 00:49:13,262
- Are you scared now? - No, I'm not.

664
00:49:14,492 --> 00:49:16,133
Forget it. If you have water, give me some.

665
00:49:16,532 --> 00:49:17,662
I don't have any water.

666
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:20,233
I'm so thirsty.

667
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:23,773
Then why don't you wait here?

668
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:25,503
I'll go pick up something to drink.

669
00:49:26,472 --> 00:49:28,412
- Let's go together. - Why?

670
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:30,012
I guess you're too scared to be alone.

671
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:31,412
I told you I'm not scared!

672
00:49:32,943 --> 00:49:34,153
Go ahead, then.

673
00:49:34,282 --> 00:49:37,282
But don't get soda. It's not good for the teeth.

674
00:49:37,582 --> 00:49:38,753
You have to stay right here, okay?

675
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:40,483
I don't want you to get lost.

676
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:44,793
Come back quickly.

677
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:54,403
It's so strange.

678
00:49:55,202 --> 00:49:56,803
I've walked around quite a bit...

679
00:49:58,102 --> 00:49:59,903
but haven't seen a single person.

680
00:50:02,343 --> 00:50:03,472
Kiddo.

681
00:50:12,553 --> 00:50:14,492
I hurt my leg.

682
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:16,952
Can you help me carry this?

683
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,863
How... How far are you going?

684
00:50:19,293 --> 00:50:21,363
I live up there.

685
00:50:21,463 --> 00:50:22,832
Just to my place.

686
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:26,332
But I have to hurry home too.

687
00:50:28,102 --> 00:50:29,372
I'm in trouble.

688
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:32,903
My daughter must be waiting for me all alone at home.

689
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:37,412
She's been running a high fever since this morning.

690
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:40,312
I have to get home quickly, but I can't because of my injured leg.

691
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:46,323
I'll help you carry it, then.

692
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,122
You're such a good boy.

693
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:53,593
Do you want to drink this?

694
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:56,162
I'm giving it to you to thank you.

695
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:58,363
No, thank you. It's okay.

696
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:01,803
You don't have to refuse it. I really just want to thank you.

697
00:51:03,432 --> 00:51:05,803
Then... Thank you.

698
00:51:18,523 --> 00:51:19,722
Please move everything in this room...

699
00:51:21,852 --> 00:51:23,452
to Young Joon's room.

700
00:51:24,762 --> 00:51:27,863
Pardon me? Why all of a sudden...

701
00:51:29,492 --> 00:51:30,903
That's my room, you know.

702
00:51:32,363 --> 00:51:35,073
What do you mean?

703
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:38,773
That was originally my room,

704
00:51:41,113 --> 00:51:42,642
and this was Young Joon's room.

705
00:51:53,553 --> 00:51:55,193
You knew everything, didn't you?

706
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:00,562
You've been working for our family since I was a little kid.

707
00:52:06,662 --> 00:52:09,003
Then I'll move everything here to that room...

708
00:52:09,532 --> 00:52:12,242
around the weekend like you said.

709
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:23,553
It was all his to begin with.

710
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:26,823
Everything from this room...

711
00:52:28,622 --> 00:52:29,852
to what happened that day.

712
00:52:33,023 --> 00:52:34,093
Where did you leave him?

713
00:52:34,662 --> 00:52:36,193
Where is he? Answer me!

714
00:52:37,062 --> 00:52:38,932
Sung Yeon, we don't have time.

715
00:52:39,262 --> 00:52:40,602
Tell me now. Please?

716
00:52:40,832 --> 00:52:43,073
Where did you leave him? Sung Yeon!

717
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:45,472
- You can tell me, Sung Yeon. - Gosh, Ms. Choi.

718
00:52:45,673 --> 00:52:46,803
Tell me!

719
00:52:50,782 --> 00:52:51,883
Sung Hyun.

720
00:52:59,082 --> 00:53:01,523
He may have the scar for the rest of his life.

721
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:04,492
Because of me...

722
00:53:15,332 --> 00:53:17,503
But still, I can't believe I completely changed my memories.

723
00:53:27,512 --> 00:53:28,653
Back then,

724
00:53:32,352 --> 00:53:34,293
when I got home from the hospital,

725
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:39,863
something that I had never even imagined...

726
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,262
was waiting for me.

727
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:47,032
What are you doing in my room?

728
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,972
Why are you wearing my clothes?

729
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:54,113
I told you not to touch my stuff!

730
00:53:55,312 --> 00:53:56,843
Why did you barge into my room?

731
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:58,812
This isn't your room.

732
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:01,312
- This is my... - Get out!

733
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:06,082
I was locked up in there for three days because of you.

734
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:08,753
I was confined in that place for three days, and I almost died!

735
00:54:10,352 --> 00:54:13,423
Get out this instant. Get out of my room right now!

736
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:16,093
Get out of my sight this instant!

737
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:18,562
Get lost. Get out!

738
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:21,372
I told you to get out! Get out.

739
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:23,102
You jerk...

740
00:54:24,102 --> 00:54:26,003
It seems like the severe guilt...

741
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:28,912
completely altered his memories.

742
00:54:31,043 --> 00:54:33,782
He strongly believes that he was the one who was kidnapped.

743
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:36,653
He's exhibiting aggressive behavior because he believes...

744
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:38,682
that people around him are trying to fool him.

745
00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:45,162
Get out of my sight!

746
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:47,963
Get lost this instant. Get out!

747
00:54:49,262 --> 00:54:50,392
Get lost.

748
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,463
At first, I was flustered and puzzled.

749
00:54:54,573 --> 00:54:57,202
But gradually, those feelings turned into resentment and anger.

750
00:54:59,043 --> 00:55:01,142
I was the one who experienced that whole thing.

751
00:55:03,713 --> 00:55:05,443
I was still hurt and traumatized.

752
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:10,182
How dare he play a victim and accuse me?

753
00:55:12,782 --> 00:55:13,952
You jerk!

754
00:55:16,352 --> 00:55:17,492
- How dare you. - Get back here.

755
00:55:18,122 --> 00:55:20,293
- You little... - I told you to get lost!

756
00:55:20,562 --> 00:55:23,233
- You brat. - You jerk.

757
00:55:23,662 --> 00:55:26,832
After a certain point, I did not want to lose.

758
00:55:27,903 --> 00:55:30,273
And later on, we started tussling so vigorously that we could...

759
00:55:30,273 --> 00:55:32,242
barely calm down even when our parents got involved.

760
00:55:34,343 --> 00:55:35,742
We kept getting more vicious.

761
00:55:37,782 --> 00:55:40,582
A psychiatric hospital? How can you suggest such a thing?

762
00:55:40,912 --> 00:55:43,053
The doctor said it's because Sung Yeon is fainthearted.

763
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:46,282
It's just a temporary confusion caused by his guilt.

764
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:48,293
How could we do that to him?

765
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:51,093
Didn't you see Sung Yeon swinging the baseball bat yesterday?

766
00:55:51,923 --> 00:55:54,733
And we have to think about Sung Hyun too.

767
00:55:54,992 --> 00:55:57,093
How could he recover from what he experienced in this environment?

768
00:55:57,602 --> 00:55:59,702
If we do nothing, we'll end up ruining both of their lives.

769
00:56:01,102 --> 00:56:03,472
But how can we send Sung Yeon to a psychiatric hospital?

770
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:06,803
Why is this happening to us?

771
00:56:10,543 --> 00:56:13,812
Gosh, I want to die. I can't take this anymore.

772
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:20,693
To me, death...

773
00:56:22,923 --> 00:56:25,162
was no longer an abstract notion.

774
00:56:28,562 --> 00:56:29,992
Everything about the kind of death...

775
00:56:32,562 --> 00:56:33,733
that I knew...

776
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:36,202
was very clear from its shape...

777
00:56:38,173 --> 00:56:39,372
and sound...

778
00:56:43,642 --> 00:56:45,213
to its smell.

779
00:56:51,682 --> 00:56:52,782
What about Sung Yeon?

780
00:57:00,662 --> 00:57:01,793
Let's eat.

781
00:57:09,303 --> 00:57:10,432
Sung Hyun!

782
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:15,642
Sung Yeon was kidnapped?

783
00:57:17,282 --> 00:57:19,883
Because I left him alone there...

784
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:24,952
I really don't remember anything.

785
00:57:26,282 --> 00:57:27,523
I'm sorry.

786
00:57:29,492 --> 00:57:30,722
I'm sorry, Sung Yeon.

787
00:57:42,803 --> 00:57:43,943
Back then, I thought...

788
00:57:45,872 --> 00:57:48,713
it was the only way everyone in our family could survive.

789
00:57:53,383 --> 00:57:54,682
I'm sorry, Young Joon.

790
00:57:57,823 --> 00:57:58,952
It's all my fault.

791
00:58:03,323 --> 00:58:05,662
You had it the hardest.

792
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,262
Why did I say such a thing back then?

793
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:14,273
As for Sung Yeon,

794
00:58:16,003 --> 00:58:19,202
even if he believed that he was the one who had been kidnapped,

795
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:23,343
he never actually saw or experienced it.

796
00:58:24,312 --> 00:58:26,213
So we thought he couldn't have been more traumatized than you were.

797
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,462
We thought...

798
00:58:29,062 --> 00:58:32,232
that was the only way we could protect both of you.

799
00:58:33,672 --> 00:58:35,603
If we made things right that time,

800
00:58:37,172 --> 00:58:40,413
perhaps you two could have lived a happier life.

801
00:58:42,513 --> 00:58:44,283
The guilt and regret have been...

802
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,123
haunting me my whole life.

803
00:58:49,723 --> 00:58:51,723
It's our fault.

804
00:58:52,993 --> 00:58:54,692
We let you carry...

805
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:57,192
that big burden alone.

806
00:58:58,132 --> 00:59:01,303
We are really sorry.

807
00:59:06,132 --> 00:59:07,203
Don't say that.

808
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:09,343
I understand.

809
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:11,042
No.

810
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:14,382
Don't try to understand us, Young Joon.

811
00:59:16,413 --> 00:59:18,882
You should blame us and resent us now.

812
00:59:21,323 --> 00:59:23,022
Say it's been really hard.

813
00:59:24,223 --> 00:59:26,053
Say you've been lonely.

814
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:28,493
You can say that.

815
00:59:30,022 --> 00:59:31,763
You are allowed to do that, Young Joon.

816
01:00:38,132 --> 01:00:39,292
Ms. Kim.

817
01:00:42,562 --> 01:00:44,002
Please...

818
01:00:45,002 --> 01:00:46,332
take good care of Young Joon.

819
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:52,812
Don't worry, Ms.Choi.

820
01:02:12,093 --> 01:02:15,393
Mr. Lee, what should we eat for dinner tonight?

821
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,593
I don't know.

822
01:02:19,462 --> 01:02:22,732
You seemed to like the omelet. Should I make that again?

823
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:27,033
Or... Right.

824
01:02:27,033 --> 01:02:28,843
We still have some wine from last night.

825
01:02:28,843 --> 01:02:30,573
Should we watch a movie while drinking that?

826
01:02:35,283 --> 01:02:36,683
How's Sung Yeon right now?

827
01:02:38,783 --> 01:02:42,053
He says he's going back to France soon.

828
01:02:43,922 --> 01:02:45,522
I think...

829
01:02:47,053 --> 01:02:48,692
he won't come back for a long time.

830
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,827
What are you doing here?

831
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:29,936
You chose...

832
01:03:31,036 --> 01:03:32,336
to run away again?

833
01:03:33,907 --> 01:03:34,936
What?

834
01:03:38,246 --> 01:03:39,376
Yes.

835
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,347
You must think I am weak and pathetic.

836
01:03:44,347 --> 01:03:45,947
That's why you made...

837
01:03:46,947 --> 01:03:49,117
such an arrogant decision that time.

838
01:03:51,856 --> 01:03:53,086
At the time, you should've...

839
01:03:54,527 --> 01:03:56,157
trusted me.

840
01:03:56,527 --> 01:03:58,967
You should trusted that I would be able to get through it alone.

841
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:02,237
You should've fought with me instead of covering up the truth!

842
01:04:05,067 --> 01:04:06,606
You must've thought you were the only one who could...

843
01:04:06,606 --> 01:04:08,106
put an end to the situation...

844
01:04:08,106 --> 01:04:10,036
and pretended to have lost the memory. But I...

845
01:04:12,706 --> 01:04:14,577
Because of that arrogant decision of yours,

846
01:04:15,077 --> 01:04:16,516
I spent half of my life hating you...

847
01:04:16,746 --> 01:04:19,347
and pitying me.

848
01:04:19,347 --> 01:04:20,447
Do you know that?

849
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:28,626
I am sorry.

850
01:04:32,797 --> 01:04:33,967
What?

851
01:04:35,737 --> 01:04:36,867
I...

852
01:04:39,036 --> 01:04:42,106
I thought pretending to have lost the memory was for the best.

853
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:47,206
I thought everything was going to be fine...

854
01:04:47,206 --> 01:04:49,016
if I live with the name "Lee Young Joon"...

855
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:52,117
instead of the name "Lee Sung Hyun",

856
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,516
which confused you more.

857
01:04:55,086 --> 01:04:56,856
I thought everything was going to be fine...

858
01:04:58,456 --> 01:04:59,786
if I sacrifice myself.

859
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,396
But today,

860
01:05:07,697 --> 01:05:11,007
when I heard that Mother lived her whole life feeling guilty,

861
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,436
I suddenly thought of this.

862
01:05:17,137 --> 01:05:18,706
Perhaps we should've gotten through it together,

863
01:05:19,947 --> 01:05:23,447
even if it would've been tough.

864
01:05:27,487 --> 01:05:28,987
That's family.

865
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,496
Like you said,

866
01:05:36,657 --> 01:05:37,996
I was arrogant.

867
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:43,067
I took away your chance to correct things.

868
01:05:43,637 --> 01:05:44,806
I am truly sorry.

869
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:50,436
How can you...

870
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,847
forgive me?

871
01:05:55,847 --> 01:05:57,847
I tortured you for such a long time.

872
01:06:03,456 --> 01:06:07,186
I would be lying if I say that it hasn't been painful.

873
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:09,257
But...

874
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:11,967
it wasn't because of you.

875
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:16,867
It was just that the shock I got from that day was too big.

876
01:06:22,907 --> 01:06:25,476
From the start, I wasn't in pain because of you.

877
01:06:26,106 --> 01:06:28,046
So there's nothing to forgive you for.

878
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,417
So you should...

879
01:06:33,546 --> 01:06:34,917
I know it's hard,

880
01:06:36,386 --> 01:06:38,987
but I wish you will put down the agony and be free.

881
01:06:42,827 --> 01:06:45,796
Don't do it for me. Do it for yourself.

882
01:06:56,676 --> 01:06:57,947
I am sorry.

883
01:07:04,346 --> 01:07:05,646
At the time, I...

884
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:09,886
I had to be someone else.

885
01:07:15,796 --> 01:07:17,827
That was the only way I could live.

886
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,287
Why are you smiling?

887
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,617
I thought it was going to be uncomfortable...

888
01:08:49,617 --> 01:08:51,686
when all the truths come out.

889
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:53,886
It actually feels good.

890
01:08:55,856 --> 01:08:57,997
I'm glad I told the truth

891
01:08:59,127 --> 01:09:00,226
Of course.

892
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:03,466
There's nothing better than being honest.

893
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:08,837
Do you really think so?

894
01:09:15,846 --> 01:09:16,877
Then...

895
01:09:22,716 --> 01:09:25,957
Can I honestly tell you how I feel right now?

896
01:10:11,237 --> 01:10:12,436
I don't want to...

897
01:10:13,636 --> 01:10:15,207
waste away this night.
