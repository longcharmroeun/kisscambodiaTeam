1
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:11,410
What?

2
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:14,451
You proposed to Ms. Kim?

3
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:15,951
I did.

4
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:18,480
What did she say? Did she say yes?

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,050
She didn't talk for a while.

6
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:25,921
She put her face very close to mine.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,331
Her face? And?

8
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:32,860
Then she moved it very close...

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,671
to my neck.

10
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:37,970
That tickles, doesn't it?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,201
She smelled me.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,211
Did she smell you?

13
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,481
Have you been drinking?

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,281
That's what she said.

15
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,200
The mighty Young Joon got humiliated by his secretary.

16
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,711
Why does my stomach hurt so much? Did I eat something bad?

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,351
Does this mean she wanted a proper proposal?

18
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,950
I understand. She must've been surprised.

19
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,751
How could she dare to think of me as her potential husband material?

20
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,021
Do you mean that?

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,021
I'm sure she was enraptured and dumbfounded.

22
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:33,820
She couldn't be herself. I give her that.

23
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,530
- Hey. - Yes?

24
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:39,161
It's possible that Ms. Kim was perfectly herself.

25
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,870
Maybe she just didn't want to get married.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Can there be such a person in this world?

27
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:52,211
(Episode 2)

28
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,111
He didn't seem drunk.

29
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,191
What? Marry him?

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,820
What am I thinking?

31
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,631
He probably was just joking.

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,660
Who could it be?

33
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,900
Who is it?

34
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,241
You can't leave me alone, can you?

35
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,481
Where is he? Where is he?

36
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:34,690
I asked you. Where is he?

37
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,021
Where is he?

38
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:42,361
I clearly saw Young Joon coming in here.

39
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,801
Ms. Oh, Mr. Lee left half an hour ago.

40
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,671
- Didn't you see him? - I didn't see him.

41
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,100
Why did you not see that?

42
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,541
I was busy updating my social media.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,541
- Waiting is... What is love? - Here we go.

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,780
Say cheese.

45
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:03,680
What are you?

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,880
Why would Young Joon visit you at this hour?

47
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,921
In this closed space,

48
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,361
what did you two do?

49
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:12,660
Ms. Oh.

50
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:15,391
Mr. Lee and I...

51
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,530
are not at all what you imagine.

52
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,961
- Gosh, then why wouldn't he... - Sleep with you?

53
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,171
After dating for a month?

54
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,000
- What? - "Then who is he sleeping with?"

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,271
That's what you're curious about, isn't it?

56
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,340
No one.

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,211
He's not sleeping with anybody.

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,350
Mr. Lee always goes home after a few drinks and sleeps alone.

59
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:40,220
How do you know that?

60
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,991
Ms. Oh.

61
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,321
You see, I am six years older than you.

62
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,900
Why don't we treat each other with some respect?

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Okay.

64
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,370
Have you ever met with Mr. Lee in private?

65
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,711
- No. - Has he ever touched you?

66
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,280
Well, that's...

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,981
Unless something special comes up, Mr. Lee goes to a social party...

68
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,581
every other Tuesday and Thursday.

69
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,491
It's actually an extension of work to form amicable relationships.

70
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:19,961
You get invited to the Tuesday party.

71
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,761
And someone else gets invited to the Thursday one.

72
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,261
The other girl who used to get invited to the Thursday party...

73
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:27,061
came and nitpicked at me just like you. Once Mr. Lee found out,

74
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,371
she was let go right away.

75
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,271
Do you get it now?

76
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,470
For the past nine years I served Mr. Lee,

77
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,441
he never dated any woman.

78
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,280
Of course, there were countless rumors about his relationships.

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,881
But he has neither dated nor slept with anyone.

80
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,480
I know that very well.

81
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,381
I don't believe it. How can there be a man like that?

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,050
Are you...

83
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,990
He's not with me.

84
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,331
- Then... - He's not a gay either.

85
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,860
What is it then?

86
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,590
Mr. Lee...

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,030
is incapable of dating anyone.

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,371
- Why is that? - That is because...

89
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:06,170
- That is because... - he is so perfect...

90
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,470
that no woman can please him.

91
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,040
What?

92
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,381
Mr. Lee is...

93
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,850
I am far too good to be given to any woman.

94
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,850
I am too good to be claimed by someone.

95
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,961
He's the greatest narcissist of the century.

96
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,061
He's self-love itself.

97
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:28,631
Do you know what was the first thing I said when I first met him?

98
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:29,931
What was it?

99
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,230
- For our company. - For our company.

100
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,701
Welcome to the team.

101
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,081
What is your name?

102
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,751
My name is Kim Mi So.

103
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:52,751
- Ms. Kim Mi So. - Yes.

104
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:54,621
Do you know who I am?

105
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,271
His entirety was screaming,

106
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,240
"I am the Chairman's son." That was how it was like.

107
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,381
It was as if everyone in the world was expected to know him.

108
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:20,211
Right. That's exactly it.

109
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,081
That's what's so charming about my Young Joon though.

110
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,751
You still don't get it, do you?

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,691
He may seem rich and fancy. But he is full of himself.

112
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,220
In the future, you should try to meet...

113
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,360
a man who sincerely loves you and cares about you.

114
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:39,360
I am really touched.

115
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,400
Thank you so much, Mi So.

116
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:47,571
Don't ever forget that the most important thing is yourself.

117
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,610
All right.

118
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,511
Do you truly think that was a rejection?

119
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
Yes.

120
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,881
I know this is hard for you to believe, but that's what I think.

121
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,251
No way.

122
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,920
- Aren't you a bit obsessed... - What do you mean by "obsessed"?

123
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,321
Yes, of course you're not.

124
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,990
It is true that Ms. Kim is kind, smart, and good at her job.

125
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,220
- That's right. - But to be honest,

126
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,391
someone of your caliber can surely find another secretary like that.

127
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:10,061
And Ms. Kim didn't graduate from a prestigious school either.

128
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,931
Things like her educational background or credentials...

129
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,501
are not relevant to her duties at all.

130
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,431
At any rate, I need Ms. Kim.

131
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,871
Be honest with me.

132
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:21,311
- Do you like Ms. Kim? - Of course I do.

133
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:24,711
No, no, I don't mean merely as your employee.

134
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,181
I mean in a romantic way.

135
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,780
- What are you saying? - Do you like Kim Mi So...

136
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,811
as just your secretary or as a woman?

137
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:32,321
I'm asking you about your feelings for her as a man...

138
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,881
and not as Vice Chairman Lee Young Joon.

139
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:42,831
Ms. Kim is someone whom I need.

140
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,030
Yes, and why is that?

141
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:49,533
Do you like Kim Mi So as a woman, not as a secretary?

142
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,043
I'm asking you about your feelings for her as a man...

143
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:52,543
and not as Vice Chairman Lee Young Joon.

144
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,584
Ms. Kim is someone whom I need.

145
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:02,783
Yes, and why is that?

146
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,324
I guess that I could say that...

147
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,224
she is like a suit that was tailor-made for me.

148
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:13,594
Because, off-the-rack clothes produced in factories...

149
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,834
do not fit my body perfectly nor do they suit me.

150
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,563
Well, I'll be going now.

151
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:22,403
Wow, he's comparing people to clothing now?

152
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:25,074
Work hard at it, Young Joon!

153
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:30,813
Thank you so much for today.

154
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:33,913
It's okay for me to contact you again in the future, right?

155
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:35,813
Take care.

156
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:42,423
What about you?

157
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:45,023
Have you ever met a man like that before?

158
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,423
A man who is very considerate?

159
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:13,354
(To my older brother)

160
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:15,754
(Dad bought some caramels today)

161
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:16,793
(You saved a lot of your caramels, so our sisters tried to eat yours)

162
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:17,824
(But I protected your caramels)

163
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:30,633
I want to live an ordinary life, like everyone else.

164
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,543
I want to have a child with an ordinary man to have a family.

165
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:36,074
You sure are an extremely selfish person, Ms. Kim.

166
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:38,944
Then what am I supposed to do?

167
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:40,844
Pardon?

168
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:43,354
We worked together for nine years.

169
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:45,423
From the moment until I started working in management,

170
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:47,283
I was completely and utterly accommodating to you.

171
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:49,523
So what am I supposed to do if you just quit all of the sudden...

172
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,224
I...

173
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:55,033
I...

174
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:57,834
I...

175
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,004
will be hugely inconvenienced.

176
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:07,974
Did I stutter?

177
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,444
It is true that this will be inconvenient for me after all.

178
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,063
- Ji Ah! - Ms. Kim!

179
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,563
- Hello! - You're here early.

180
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,563
Yes. Today's my first day on the job.

181
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,303
My heart is racing right now.

182
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,974
I'm excited, and nervous.

183
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,474
I'm sure you'll do great.

184
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:40,803
All right.

185
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:42,844
Thank you. Goodbye.

186
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,444
Say hello, everyone.

187
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,084
This is Ms. Kim Ji Ah,

188
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:47,714
who will start training today as my replacement.

189
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,883
Hello, everyone. I'll do my best.

190
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:54,793
Ms. Ji Ah.

191
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:56,224
That's Mr. Jung Chi In, the general manager.

192
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,763
That's Ms. Bong Se Ra, the manager.

193
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,824
That's Mr. Park Joon Hwan, and she is Ms. Lee Young Ok.

194
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:02,663
Nice to meet you all.

195
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:05,563
Nice to meet you too, um... Ms. Kim?

196
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:06,933
Goodness, she's "Ms. Kim", too!

197
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:10,874
It seems that your replacement is also "Ms. Kim", Ms. Kim!

198
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,143
Wow, what a coincidence!

199
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:16,214
Or maybe it's a fate, not a mere coincidence.

200
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,344
Having some fresh blood around these parts...

201
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:22,283
is already changing the atmosphere around here!

202
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:26,283
I graduated from the best university in Korea, Ms. Kim.

203
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:28,454
So that may make you feel a bit intimidated.

204
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,324
But there is a kind, guy-next-door side to me as well!

205
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:33,724
So if you're ever having any trouble,

206
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,433
don't hesitate to come and talk to me!

207
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,803
All right, I won't!

208
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:40,663
I'm sure that I have a lot to learn, but please help me out!

209
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,374
If you have a lot to learn, you should take care of that yourself.

210
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:45,204
Why are you asking us for help?

211
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,643
This is a place for professionals only...

212
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,374
and not some kind of study group, you know.

213
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,474
Don't be so harsh.

214
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:52,244
Am I wrong, though? New hires are annoying enough as it is.

215
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,313
What are we supposed to do with a super young person like her?

216
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,214
I'll work really hard!

217
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:59,824
I'll make sure she's perfect before I leave, so don't worry.

218
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:01,954
Just make me your replacement instead, Ms. Kim!

219
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:05,023
I'm... I'm worried!

220
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,393
The vice chairman is coming in.

221
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:12,933
- Hello, sir. - Hello, sir.

222
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:19,574
Is it just me, or does it seem colder in here?

223
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,673
It's not just you. I felt it too.

224
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,933
Is she seriously going to reject my proposal?

225
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,704
How could she ever think to insult me like this?

226
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,084
My tongue!

227
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:10,523
How dare she put me through this kind of pain!

228
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:17,433
These are Mr. Lee's business ledgers sorted by year.

229
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:20,263
And these are records of the overseas business trips he went on.

230
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,173
And this is his visitors' log.

231
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:26,104
And this is his schedule for the next six months...

232
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,844
so be sure to learn this as soon as possible.

233
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:29,444
I have to learn all this?

234
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:31,043
And that, too.

235
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:40,324
Also, this is a list of the things that the executives personally like.

236
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:41,754
They'll like it if you memorize this in advance...

237
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,194
and give these things to them when they come by.

238
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:46,224
So I have to memorize things like these?

239
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,364
Oh, and this one is quite important.

240
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:51,063
Cable ties are strictly forbidden to be used by Mr. Lee.

241
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,464
- Be sure to remember that. - All right.

242
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,643
There are photos in here.

243
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:03,273
It's because we take photos whenever there's a huge event.

244
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:06,283
When was this taken?

245
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,783
You two look so young here!

246
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:10,584
This was taken around nine years ago.

247
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,824
It was when I went on an overseas trip to the U.S. with Mr. Lee.

248
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:14,283
It was around the time when I'd just started my job...

249
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:15,354
as a secretary, just like you.

250
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,893
For some reason, I feel like you did a great job even back then.

251
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,563
No, no. I made so many mistakes back then.

252
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,004
- You're lying. - No, really.

253
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:29,374
But I started working hard so that I wouldn't be a hindrance to Mr. Lee.

254
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:30,673
And before long, I started getting better.

255
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:33,974
So don't be scared and just do your best.

256
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,913
Thank you so much.

257
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:38,143
I really will give it my all!

258
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:42,153
Can you take this to Mr. Jung, please?

259
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:44,114
Yes, leave it to me!

260
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:02,874
You can't even handle something like this properly?

261
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:08,173
Today's dinner was quite an important one.

262
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,574
So how could you ruin it all with such a basic mistake?

263
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,013
You couldn't understand something as simple as the dress code...

264
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,614
and caused this mess.

265
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,283
You can't even understand such simple things?

266
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,254
- I apologize. - Ms. Kim.

267
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:23,254
Remember what you said when I chose you...

268
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:24,523
as my secretary for my trip to the U.S.?

269
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,194
You said that you'd work hard at your job...

270
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:28,293
despite your lackluster schooling and credentials.

271
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,563
But you've made so many mistakes while we've been here already!

272
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,334
And you even ended up causing a huge problem today!

273
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,104
Ms. Kim Mi So.

274
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,303
You call this "trying your best"?

275
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,244
Is this really the best you can do?

276
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:40,903
What do you want me to do about it?

277
00:15:42,114 --> 00:15:43,273
I sleep only 2 to 3 hours a day...

278
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:46,614
because I have to adapt to life in here and study English.

279
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:49,714
I miss my sisters and my dad.

280
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,183
All the food here is too greasy to eat.

281
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:56,354
Still, I'm trying to do my best,

282
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,694
but you always scold me so grimly like this.

283
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:00,594
Are you that perfect?

284
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:03,433
Have you never made any mistake in your life?

285
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,103
Yes, I'm perfect.

286
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:07,363
I never make any mistake. Are you annoyed by it?

287
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:08,803
Then do your job properly.

288
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:10,873
If you don't want to get nagged, do your job perfectly like me.

289
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:13,103
You're awfully annoying, you know that?

290
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:15,714
I've never met such a narcist like you.

291
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:17,313
But you'll continue to see me from now on.

292
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:18,914
You think I'm crazy? I won't.

293
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:20,384
I'll quit and go back to Korea,

294
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:22,583
so look for someone else, you scum.

295
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:29,394
Scum?

296
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:40,533
I must be out of my mind.

297
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,174
Why did I have to say that I'd quit?

298
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:47,644
What should I do with our family's debt and my sisters' tuition?

299
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,714
I'm such a fool.

300
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:04,023
I admit to your guts to talk back to me.

301
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,063
Come to work by 5am tomorrow.

302
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:12,863
Thank you.

303
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,504
Thank you.

304
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:21,474
I'm saved.

305
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:38,263
I should at least do a good job in putting on a necktie on him.

306
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:41,734
This isn't right.

307
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,634
How should I do it?

308
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,664
I'll make it nice for certain.

309
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,553
Save me this once, sir.

310
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:07,484
I'll do my best in anything.

311
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:13,964
I didn't say that I'd kill you.

312
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,793
Bring me today's schedule.

313
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,214
Are you slacking off now?

314
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,914
Sir.

315
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,083
I was taking over my work.

316
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,853
What?

317
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,694
- Taking over your work? - Yes.

318
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,474
- Should I make you some warm tea? - There's no need to.

319
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:04,613
Sir, about the dinner meeting with the chairman of Daein Group,

320
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:08,484
he wants to delay today's meeting due to his bad condition.

321
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,013
- Delay the meeting then. - Yes, sir.

322
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:16,093
Well, you don't have any schedule in the evening,

323
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,724
so may I leave work early today?

324
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,823
What? You want to leave work early?

325
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:28,974
- Secretary Kim. - Yes?

326
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:31,543
How are things going about taking over Illusion Hotel?

327
00:19:31,543 --> 00:19:33,444
Contact Mr. Park right now...

328
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:35,744
I already received the contract and put it over there.

329
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:37,113
- It's there. - Yes.

330
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:42,283
- What about scouting the doctor? - The meeting is next week.

331
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:44,214
What about remodeling my library?

332
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,283
I made a list of remodeling companies.

333
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:47,623
What about my insomnia these days?

334
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:49,553
I got the pills prescribed from Dr. Kwang.

335
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,494
Okay, okay. Why are you so talkative?

336
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,793
I just answered your questions.

337
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,934
See? You're talking back to me again, Ms. Kim.

338
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,033
Yes?

339
00:19:58,634 --> 00:19:59,734
I don't like it.

340
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,033
May I leave the room if you're done talking?

341
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,404
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

342
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:19,724
Do I really have to eat lunch with my superior?

343
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,154
Having lunch is the extension of your work.

344
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,424
I see.

345
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,093
About Illusion Hotel which we're considering to take over,

346
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:27,763
its dining service has to be improved.

347
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,894
This is the hottest restaurant these days.

348
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:33,204
Its chef is from Le Cordon Bleu.

349
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,634
The dishes are nice and delicious.

350
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,373
- Try to scout him out. - Okay.

351
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:41,773
Yes, sir.

352
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,444
So what's your opinion?

353
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:48,454
Of course, I think it's good to scout that chef.

354
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:50,214
No, about Ms. Kim.

355
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,984
She seems like she's really going to quit.

356
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:55,754
How should I deal with this ridiculous situation?

357
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:02,333
I will take care of that ridiculous situation for you.

358
00:21:04,134 --> 00:21:05,204
But...

359
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:08,333
beg me a little more.

360
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,833
What more can you do for me?

361
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:17,414
Those eyes.

362
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:20,714
I've seen those eyes when you merged CS Group five years ago.

363
00:21:21,754 --> 00:21:24,783
Changing her mind is as serious as merging companies?

364
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:26,154
What?

365
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:30,754
No one will like it if you come in straightforward like this.

366
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,593
Check this out.

367
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,694
What are we doing in order to take over Illusion Hotel?

368
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:37,964
We're pleasing them, adjusting things for them,

369
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,363
- and putting our very effort. - That's right.

370
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:42,303
But you tried to take over Mi So right away...

371
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:44,444
without doing all those things yesterday.

372
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:45,873
Can't you understand?

373
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,414
- No. - You have no idea...

374
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:53,283
about what she wants and what she has in her mind.

375
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:56,613
It wasn't even dating. You proposed to her.

376
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:03,623
She would never accept it.

377
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:05,424
You must go step by step.

378
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,924
Dating comes first before marriage.

379
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:13,863
Dating comes first.

380
00:22:22,644 --> 00:22:23,873
Is my coffee still not ready?

381
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,583
Well, I'm sorry.

382
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:29,184
I actually have never done such a thing before.

383
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:30,254
What?

384
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,494
How can you be the vice chairman's secretary like this?

385
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:37,494
Move.

386
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:39,763
Put it in here.

387
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,434
Place a cup here.

388
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,793
Press this button, and it's done.

389
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,303
You're so charismatic.

390
00:22:47,704 --> 00:22:49,474
I respect you, ma'am.

391
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:52,543
Making coffee isn't something to respect about.

392
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,174
But I mean it.

393
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,773
I was in trouble because I didn't know what to do,

394
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,283
but you are so cool.

395
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:03,214
I'm not cool. I'm pretty.

396
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:05,154
Come here.

397
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:07,184
Look. Place a cup here.

398
00:23:07,694 --> 00:23:09,093
Like this and that.

399
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,293
It's so easy.

400
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:11,464
Awesome.

401
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:15,033
You look exactly like a barista in Milano.

402
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:18,333
Can I take a picture of you and keep it?

403
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:19,904
You're helpless.

404
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:21,873
My left face looks prettier, so take it from here.

405
00:23:22,674 --> 00:23:24,204
It smells good.

406
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:29,273
Hello?

407
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:31,313
Okay.

408
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,313
Ms. Kim wants to see me.

409
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,613
Please do the rest for me.

410
00:23:37,954 --> 00:23:39,583
Okay, don't worry.

411
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,053
Relax, relax.

412
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,254
Thank you.

413
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,634
What?

414
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,434
Why am I doing this right now?

415
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:04,813
What? We're having our team dinner today?

416
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,914
Yes, to welcome Ji Ah.

417
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,083
We haven't had it for a while.

418
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,283
The vice chairman called you at any time.

419
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,384
That's why you were always so busy.

420
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,154
Is it really okay today?

421
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,964
Yes, his evening schedule got canceled today.

422
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:21,033
It's perfect.

423
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,194
What should we eat though?

424
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,863
Oh, right. We have that place.

425
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:27,103
Now that he mentioned it, I crave meat so much.

426
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:30,273
They bring in black pork raised in Jeju Island...

427
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:33,404
and marinate it in sweet soy sauce for a day.

428
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:36,144
They grill the meat with charcoal.

429
00:24:36,144 --> 00:24:38,444
Then we take lettuce, sesame leaf, and two pieces of the meat...

430
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,343
and have them with garlic and ssamjang at once.

431
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,353
How about we go to the pork galbi place in the intersection?

432
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:47,123
- Sounds great. - Perfect.

433
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,394
- Awesome. - Nice.

434
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:53,763
Hello.

435
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:02,603
It's exciting.

436
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,083
- For Ms. Kim. - For Ms. Kim.

437
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,994
- It's good. - Nice.

438
00:25:22,994 --> 00:25:24,863
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

439
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:26,964
- It looks good. - Looks delicious.

440
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,134
- Thank you. - Thank you.

441
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,563
Why aren't you eating the meat?

442
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:35,904
You said you wanted to have pork galbi earlier.

443
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,803
I gain weight easily if I don't control my diet.

444
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,504
I'm fine. Suit yourself, please.

445
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:42,773
Excuse me. Can we have some more lettuce?

446
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:45,283
Eat the meat instead. Cows ate a lot of grass already.

447
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:51,823
Is this pork galbi or steak?

448
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:54,023
You shouldn't cut it this big.

449
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:57,224
How can you be the vice chairman's secretary if you don't know this?

450
00:25:57,894 --> 00:25:59,093
I'm sorry.

451
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,363
Give me that.

452
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,103
Look.

453
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:08,234
Cut it like this.

454
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,144
Cut it in an edible size of 3cm by 3cm like this.

455
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:12,773
Is it that hard?

456
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:15,313
You're so charismatic.

457
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:17,474
I respect you so much.

458
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:20,543
Cutting meat isn't something to respect about.

459
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:22,513
But I mean it.

460
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:26,184
I respect someone who's good at things that I can't.

461
00:26:27,523 --> 00:26:29,154
Can I take pictures of you again?

462
00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:31,623
You're so helpless.

463
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:33,793
Don't forget to take it from the left side.

464
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:34,833
Okay.

465
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:46,174
Hello?

466
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,613
You're good.

467
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:51,813
- You should open a restaurant. - Eat this.

468
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:53,714
- Thank you. - Ms. Bong.

469
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:57,313
Eat as you grill. You might miss all the meat.

470
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:01,454
What am I doing right now?

471
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:10,494
Gosh, you startled me.

472
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,964
It's me who got startled...

473
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:15,333
by your coy behavior.

474
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:16,704
What?

475
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,204
Think about it.

476
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:20,644
You tell me that you respect me and stuff on purpose,

477
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,944
then you make me do all the work, right?

478
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,613
- That's not true. - I'll be watching you...

479
00:27:25,613 --> 00:27:27,884
with my dear-like eyes.

480
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:34,724
- Gosh. - Thanks.

481
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:36,654
- Let's drink already. - All right.

482
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,763
Bottoms up.

483
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:39,093
- Cheers. - Cheers.

484
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:42,093
What? It's broken.

485
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,434
Excuse me.

486
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,404
Goodness.

487
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:49,373
- Mr. Jung! - Are you okay?

488
00:27:50,073 --> 00:27:52,174
- Your stockings got ripped. - Are you okay?

489
00:27:52,174 --> 00:27:53,644
I'm okay.

490
00:27:57,373 --> 00:28:00,583
Isn't this a bad sign?

491
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:02,853
I'm getting a bad feeling.

492
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:04,353
What's wrong with you? Stop scaring us.

493
00:28:32,613 --> 00:28:34,553
- Let's go again. - Bottoms up.

494
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:37,484
- Hold up your glasses. - Here, here.

495
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:39,254
What brings you here, sir?

496
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:42,823
Hello.

497
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,763
I thought I heard you were having the team dinner here.

498
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,704
I shouldn't miss out my team's get-together.

499
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,773
Should I just stand here like this?

500
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,474
I'm sorry. Come this way.

501
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:00,873
- Yes. - Have a seat.

502
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,813
- Excuse me, we need more utensils. - Have a seat.

503
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:04,484
Bring us one more glass too.

504
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:17,053
Do you usually like to eat...

505
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:18,694
at a noisy place full of smoke?

506
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:20,964
Is it uncomfortable for you?

507
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,063
I'm fine.

508
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,474
I'll pour each of you a drink for your hard work.

509
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:38,583
How would you like 55-year-old whisky? You're okay with it, right?

510
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,944
Whisky, my foot.

511
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,154
We only have soju and beer.

512
00:29:43,353 --> 00:29:45,853
Just have some soju bomb, young man.

513
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:55,664
Oh, right. Speaking of which,

514
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:58,004
the alcohol section of our department store isn't doing well,

515
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,004
so what do you think is the problem?

516
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:10,373
Well...

517
00:30:11,384 --> 00:30:12,414
That's...

518
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:15,813
Sir, let's not talk about work during the team dinner.

519
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:18,853
What else do they talk other than work?

520
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,424
Is a team dinner usually this boring?

521
00:30:21,424 --> 00:30:22,523
Is it...

522
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,023
boring for you?

523
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,123
Let's play a game then.

524
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,964
- Game? - What about 3, 6, 9?

525
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:32,134
What about Bunny Bunny?

526
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:39,704
Do you know the Son Byung Ho game?

527
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,813
Good.

528
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:46,944
Is there someone named Son Byung Ho in our team?

529
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:51,924
What about the compliment game? We compliment each other in the game.

530
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:56,154
I get complimented all the time in my life,

531
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,823
but it's fine. Let's compliment each other in turn.

532
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,523
How about...

533
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:03,833
we start from the newest person in our team?

534
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,803
Okay, I...

535
00:31:09,674 --> 00:31:12,144
I'd like to compliment Ms. Kim.

536
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,214
I was so nervous today,

537
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:19,244
but thank you so much for teaching me in such a friendly way.

538
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,613
I see.

539
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:25,323
Ms. Kim is handing over her work to you in a friendly way.

540
00:31:25,623 --> 00:31:26,623
That's right.

541
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:37,593
I'd like to compliment you, sir.

542
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:41,073
You're smart enough to speak five languages.

543
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:43,573
- And you're so handsome. - Thank you.

544
00:31:43,573 --> 00:31:45,504
You look amazing in that suit.

545
00:31:45,674 --> 00:31:47,343
I believe being rich is one's ability as well.

546
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,843
I compliment you for having the most amount of fortunes...

547
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:52,013
among all people in their 30s in the country.

548
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:01,724
Okay.

549
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:04,323
Is there anything you want to compliment?

550
00:32:04,363 --> 00:32:06,964
For example, my broadminded personality...

551
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:08,894
that enabled me to understand your faults.

552
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:12,603
I'd like to compliment myself for having worked hard until now...

553
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:16,404
and for being ready to put all the burden down now.

554
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:26,083
You look a little tired now.

555
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,113
Why don't you go home and rest?

556
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,154
We're finishing it off already?

557
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,924
Shouldn't we go to a karaoke room for the next round?

558
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:36,823
- Ji Ah. - Yes?

559
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:38,494
Stop it.

560
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:40,763
A karaoke room?

561
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:49,004
I'll go there with you.

562
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:51,944
What?

563
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,373
Let's go.

564
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:57,684
Let's go.

565
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,184
It feels so good.

566
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,384
It feels good.

567
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:05,654
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

568
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,754
About this karaoke room,

569
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:11,324
how great is it that you're going there despite these bad conditions?

570
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:14,023
Why don't you go home then?

571
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,933
It's not right to order around.

572
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:20,134
What on earth is wrong with him today?

573
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:30,158

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

574
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:39,054
I didn't think it was proper to order around at your get-together.

575
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:41,623
So I stayed quiet,

576
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:43,853
but this really isn't right. Ms. Kim.

577
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,264
- Yes. - Yes.

578
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,194
- Ms. Kim. - Yes.

579
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,933
Make a reservation at Valencia in Cheongdam-dong right now.

580
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:52,203
Okay, sir.

581
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:11,583
It's for certain

582
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,723
Call me if you need me

583
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:20,764
I'll be right there

584
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:24,433
It doesn't matter if it's day or night

585
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,134
You look very pleasant.

586
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,174
Is it because I'm here?

587
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:31,344
Yes.

588
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:47,654
Does it not suit your taste? Should I throw it away?

589
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:50,793
Oh, no. I got you a snack myself.

590
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:54,793
Okay, thank you.

591
00:35:04,944 --> 00:35:06,804
My eyes

592
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:10,444
My lovely touch

593
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,523
Thank you.

594
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,234
It's not water. It's alcohol.

595
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,333
It's the 55-year-old whisky which I didn't get to order earlier.

596
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,904
What do you think? Isn't it different even from the scent?

597
00:35:41,674 --> 00:35:44,413
Yes, the taste is very memorable.

598
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:48,554
I can buy you another one next time if you'd like.

599
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:50,313
- You - You said

600
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:55,324
Your elbow.

601
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:02,063
All right, let's move on to the next performance.

602
00:36:02,063 --> 00:36:03,964
Our rising star!

603
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:06,603
- Our rising star. - Give her a big hand!

604
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:20,484
When I see you once, I want to see you two more times

605
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:24,353
When I see you 2 or 3 times, I want to hold you in my arms

606
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:28,393
I want us to wear matching rings

607
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:32,464
And walk on this street together

608
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:34,293
Ms. Lee.

609
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:37,933
- Ms. Lee. - Gosh, you're doing that again.

610
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,464
Stop eating. Enough! Goodness.

611
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,243
You shouldn't drink anymore. I'm worried you might make a mistake.

612
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:47,074
Gosh, don't you worry.

613
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:49,074
Have you ever seen me making a drunken mistake?

614
00:36:50,313 --> 00:36:51,743
- Mr. Chu - Chu!

615
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,583
- On my lips - Chu!

616
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,453
Sweetly, chu

617
00:36:55,484 --> 00:36:58,824
I lose all strength in my body

618
00:36:58,824 --> 00:37:02,353
You shake up my heart, you shake me all up

619
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:04,223
Move!

620
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:07,424
I'm going to sing the second verse.

621
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:09,964
Mr. Chu

622
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,603
You shake up my heart

623
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:15,833
You shake me all up, you shake up

624
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,074
Mr. Chu

625
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:20,804
You shake up my heart

626
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:27,484
Hey! I want to...

627
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:32,784
be your secretary too, Mr. Lee.

628
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,054
I want to do it too!

629
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:36,054
- Gosh. - Goodness.

630
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,964
- Hey, enough. You're... - Let go!

631
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:44,663
What do these two girls, Kim Mi So...

632
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:47,464
and Kim Ji Ah, have that I don't have?

633
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,973
Answer me! What do I lack?

634
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:52,304
You shake me all up

635
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:54,373
- Mr. Lee... - Hey.

636
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:56,074
- Stop it. - Let go.

637
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,543
- Gosh, seriously. - Mr. Lee.

638
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,694
Mr. Lee.

639
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,433
- Get her out of here. - Yes, sir!

640
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,864
Gosh, let go of me. Let go.

641
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,574
- Shut it. - I feel like throwing up.

642
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:23,404
Wait, I'm serious. I think I'm going to throw up.

643
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:36,384
Company dinners are exhausting.

644
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,723
- Could you explain now? - Explain what?

645
00:38:40,723 --> 00:38:43,293
Why did you do things that you'd never do normally?

646
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:55,833
I'll go in, then.

647
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:59,143
- Ms. Kim. - Yes, sir.

648
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:03,313
Wasn't I very sweet today?

649
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,913
- Pardon me? - I went to the company dinner,

650
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:09,654
and I even drove you home even though it's such a hassle.

651
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:14,123
A romantic, happy day like today...

652
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:16,453
will be your everyday life from now on.

653
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:20,264
I'm sorry, but I'm not quite following.

654
00:39:20,993 --> 00:39:25,703
I'm telling you that I'm going to date you.

655
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:31,444
What is it? Are you too deeply moved?

656
00:39:33,743 --> 00:39:34,844
Mr. Lee.

657
00:39:35,913 --> 00:39:38,413
You're not my type.

658
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:44,853
- What? - I said you're not my type.

659
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:48,824
I like men who are always considerate, caring,

660
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:50,824
and sweet toward others.

661
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:55,833
Well...

662
00:39:56,493 --> 00:40:00,433
How can you say that after seeing everything I did today?

663
00:40:00,504 --> 00:40:02,973
Today, I tried very hard to be part of your everyday life.

664
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:04,904
How considerate of me, don't you think?

665
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:07,174
But I never wanted you to do any of that.

666
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:09,873
You weren't really being considerate of me.

667
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:13,543
Well, then. I hope you meet a wonderful lady soon.

668
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:33,933
He'll date me and marry me?

669
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:37,134
How can he talk about those things so lightly?

670
00:40:41,174 --> 00:40:42,674
(Vice Chairman Lee)

671
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:48,254
(Vice Chairman Lee)

672
00:40:57,023 --> 00:40:58,194
He's still here.

673
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:05,534
Ms. Kim, what's with you?

674
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:10,603
(Vice Chairman Lee: Secretary Kim, what's with you?)

675
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:11,603
I'm sorry.

676
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,174
I thought you were joking...

677
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,944
when you said yesterday that you want to marry me.

678
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,574
But you brought up the dating thing today,

679
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:19,143
so I'm really confused now.

680
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,543
Well, forget what I said.

681
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:22,384
How can you say that I'm not your type?

682
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:24,313
Are you out of your mind? Have you gone crazy?

683
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:32,393
Mi So, can you send me a heart for the mobile game?

684
00:41:32,563 --> 00:41:34,964
I'm on my break now, so I want to relieve my stress.

685
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:36,864
(Pil Nam)

686
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:38,563
(Vice Chairman Lee)

687
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:39,933
What don't you like about me?

688
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:42,804
It can't be about my looks, credentials, and wealth.

689
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:44,103
What's there to dislike?

690
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,743
You only think about yourself.

691
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:52,514
You never put yourself in others' shoes.

692
00:41:52,514 --> 00:41:53,844
You make your decisions and give orders,

693
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,413
just like what you're doing now.

694
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:01,893
Is this your way of protesting to let me know...

695
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,723
how much I've stressed you out in the last nine years?

696
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:05,563
(Is this your way of protesting?)

697
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:06,563
Gosh.

698
00:42:06,563 --> 00:42:07,764
No, that's not what I'm doing.

699
00:42:07,764 --> 00:42:10,864
(That's not what I'm doing.)

700
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:19,203
Yes. Frankly, working for you has been stressful.

701
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,504
You're egotistical and selfish.

702
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,444
You're a perfectionist, and I wonder if you have OCD.

703
00:42:22,444 --> 00:42:25,344
You look in the mirror and marvel at your own face all day long.

704
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,114
Do you know how stressful it is to work for you?

705
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,953
Also, you call me whenever you want...

706
00:42:28,953 --> 00:42:30,884
and give me work to do.

707
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,123
Because of that, I've never been able to make time for myself.

708
00:42:33,123 --> 00:42:35,654
I did that for nine long years. Of course, it was exhausting.

709
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,924
(Vice Chairman Lee)

710
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:42,194
You never said you didn't want to do it.

711
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,344
Pardon?

712
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,143
I wouldn't have made you do everything had you said no.

713
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:56,714
Except for driving me when I'm drunk.

714
00:43:01,654 --> 00:43:04,654
Like you said, let's forget about what was said and done.

715
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:08,754
I just want a normal relationship with a normal guy.

716
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:10,254
You said you'll marry me,

717
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,464
but you're definitely not cut out for romance.

718
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:16,393
The only person you can love is probably yourself.

719
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:22,134
Do you really think so?

720
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:25,473
Yes. Also, you're so inconsiderate.

721
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,473
Mi So, send me a heart. Please!

722
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,674
Gosh, seriously.

723
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:45,094
He left.

724
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:54,473
There are two people who should never call me inconsiderate.

725
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:56,234
One is my older brother...

726
00:43:56,703 --> 00:43:59,603
and the other one is you, Kim Mi So.

727
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:01,344
Remember that.

728
00:44:03,214 --> 00:44:04,944
What does that mean?

729
00:44:09,554 --> 00:44:10,654
(Vice Chairman Lee)

730
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:16,324
My gosh, did I send the hearts to him?

731
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:32,304
How could she send me hearts in the middle of that serious conversation?

732
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:37,473
Shall I say that it was a mistake?

733
00:44:38,614 --> 00:44:41,284
I was going to send it to Pil Nam but sent it to him by mistake.

734
00:44:42,353 --> 00:44:43,484
No, no.

735
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,424
I don't even know.

736
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:17,824
Kiddo.

737
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,844
(Lee Sung Yeon)

738
00:45:40,844 --> 00:45:42,473
(You must be sleeping now even though I'm suffering like this)

739
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:37,904
Sir.

740
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,504
May I...

741
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:49,873
You want to tie this for me?

742
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:45,163
(Vice Chairman Lee)

743
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:48,973
There are two people who should never call me inconsiderate.

744
00:47:49,404 --> 00:47:52,243
One is my brother and the other one is...

745
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:55,074
you, Kim Mi So. Remember that.

746
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:58,313
One is his brother and the other one is me?

747
00:48:01,853 --> 00:48:03,284
What does that mean?

748
00:48:07,654 --> 00:48:10,393
- They're progress reports. - Thank you.

749
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:13,393
- Oh, Mr. Jung. - Yes?

750
00:48:13,594 --> 00:48:15,993
You've been with the company for quite a while, right?

751
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,594
Yes, about 12 years.

752
00:48:18,404 --> 00:48:22,174
Then have you ever met Mr. Lee's older brother?

753
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:23,603
No, I've never met him.

754
00:48:23,603 --> 00:48:27,004
Oh, I heard that he lives abroad.

755
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:32,014
Does Mr. Lee's family have any problems?

756
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:33,784
Do you know anything?

757
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:37,353
How would I know something that even you don't know?

758
00:48:37,453 --> 00:48:39,754
But it is a little strange, isn't it?

759
00:48:39,824 --> 00:48:43,453
He's not involved in the business even though he's the eldest son.

760
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,023
I think it's a little...

761
00:48:45,393 --> 00:48:46,993
Right, thank you.

762
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:50,364
Okay. All right, then. Take it easy.

763
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:51,904
- Have a great day. - You too.

764
00:49:00,243 --> 00:49:03,514
You shake up my heart

765
00:49:03,514 --> 00:49:05,344
You shake me all up, you shake up

766
00:49:05,344 --> 00:49:08,953
My goodness. I actually did that?

767
00:49:09,054 --> 00:49:10,683
How am I going to face Mr. Lee from now on?

768
00:49:10,683 --> 00:49:12,824
Wait, is he going to fire me?

769
00:49:13,523 --> 00:49:14,554
Shall I...

770
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:16,554
- print your letter of resignation? - Gosh, you little...

771
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:17,864
What should I do?

772
00:49:18,464 --> 00:49:19,623
I'm doomed.

773
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,893
Mr. Lee is here.

774
00:49:23,034 --> 00:49:24,964
- Hello. - Hello.

775
00:49:27,504 --> 00:49:28,773
He's gone.

776
00:49:48,824 --> 00:49:50,154
I noticed that you're not wearing a tie.

777
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,563
I prepared a red tie for you.

778
00:49:53,893 --> 00:49:54,993
It's okay.

779
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,864
You can stop doing things like this.

780
00:49:59,234 --> 00:50:00,304
Pardon me?

781
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:04,973
You were right.

782
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:06,944
What do you mean, sir?

783
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:09,614
I am selfish and egotistical.

784
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:12,344
That's why I can understand why you want to quit...

785
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:14,384
to a certain extent.

786
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:19,623
Mr. Lee, that's not what I meant when I brought up...

787
00:50:19,623 --> 00:50:20,723
I've just realized...

788
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:24,094
the common fact that we can never have...

789
00:50:24,094 --> 00:50:25,864
everything we want.

790
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:30,293
I'll let you go now.

791
00:50:31,504 --> 00:50:33,764
Hang in there for just one more month to train up your replacement.

792
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:46,143
Thank you for your hard work.

793
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,284
I really mean it.

794
00:50:53,223 --> 00:50:54,953
That's it. You can leave.

795
00:51:29,993 --> 00:51:31,523
- Ms. Kim. - Yes, sir.

796
00:51:32,094 --> 00:51:33,864
- Ms. Kim Ji Ah. - Yes, sir.

797
00:51:33,864 --> 00:51:36,433
What's the issue our brand development team is having?

798
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,063
It's...

799
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:40,833
I got the rundown earlier.

800
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,504
I don't remember.

801
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:43,833
I'll brief you on it, sir.

802
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:47,203
It's not urgent, so I'd like Ms. Kim Ji Ah to brief me on it later.

803
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:15,703
Good. It's comfortable.

804
00:52:23,074 --> 00:52:25,784
The pieces we launched last month are getting great feedback.

805
00:52:25,944 --> 00:52:28,754
They're the best-selling furniture pieces at the moment.

806
00:52:28,984 --> 00:52:30,784
- So what's next? - Pardon me?

807
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:33,953
It's not surprising at all that the project is going well.

808
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:36,293
I'm asking you what is your plan going forward.

809
00:52:36,293 --> 00:52:39,424
Well... Our furniture is especially popular among young people,

810
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:42,393
so we plan to launch products that target newlywed couples.

811
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:45,103
Young people these days are very practical,

812
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,904
so we should consider that while developing...

813
00:52:49,373 --> 00:52:51,143
Is that really the trend these days?

814
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,074
You have all the data ready, right?

815
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,444
Pardon? Oh, that's...

816
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,583
I haven't been trained on it yet.

817
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,884
Shouldn't you already know these things?

818
00:53:05,984 --> 00:53:08,054
Are you training her properly or what?

819
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:09,393
Pardon?

820
00:53:12,424 --> 00:53:14,833
- I'm sorry, sir. - Will you train her sloppily?

821
00:53:15,194 --> 00:53:16,864
Don't disappoint me and do a good job.

822
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,304
I'm sorry.

823
00:53:39,353 --> 00:53:41,424
Is he mad at me because of what happened yesterday?

824
00:53:51,804 --> 00:53:54,603
- Did you need something, sir? - Tell Ms. Kim Ji Ah to come in.

825
00:53:56,333 --> 00:54:00,004
Mr. Lee, when we were messaging each other last night, I was...

826
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:01,944
Let's refrain from discussing personal matters in the office.

827
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:03,743
Sorry?

828
00:54:08,953 --> 00:54:10,183
Okay, sir.

829
00:54:17,094 --> 00:54:19,464
Ji Ah, Mr. Lee would like to see you.

830
00:54:19,993 --> 00:54:21,094
Okay.

831
00:54:41,984 --> 00:54:44,984
Goodness, did he really have to do that?

832
00:54:48,054 --> 00:54:50,324
Gosh, how am I going to do this for another month?

833
00:54:54,694 --> 00:54:57,393
Mr. Lee, why did you want to see me?

834
00:54:58,464 --> 00:54:59,804
Oh, it's nothing important.

835
00:55:00,304 --> 00:55:02,304
Please sit over there for five minutes and leave.

836
00:55:02,534 --> 00:55:03,634
Pardon me?

837
00:55:04,973 --> 00:55:06,074
Oh, okay.

838
00:55:08,944 --> 00:55:11,214
- By the way... - What is it?

839
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:15,654
It looks like my tasks include helping you with personal matters.

840
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:17,054
Will I also get to...

841
00:55:17,054 --> 00:55:19,484
"Personal matters"? What exactly are you referring to?

842
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:22,353
Helping you with your tie, for example.

843
00:55:24,023 --> 00:55:25,723
- No, thank you. - Sorry?

844
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:29,094
Then how would you like me to assist you...

845
00:55:29,094 --> 00:55:32,534
- Just assist Ms. Kim Mi So. - Pardon me?

846
00:55:32,534 --> 00:55:36,234
Pretend that you are under training for the job just for a month.

847
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:39,444
Pretend?

848
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:47,413
Here. Take the one with your name on it.

849
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:49,284
You are really getting married, aren't you?

850
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:50,484
Where will the wedding be?

851
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,723
You're getting married at a really nice place.

852
00:55:53,054 --> 00:55:55,694
By the way, Mi So, when will you get married?

853
00:55:55,694 --> 00:55:57,054
Married? Hey,

854
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:59,493
Mi So has never been in a relationship, you know?

855
00:55:59,663 --> 00:56:02,393
Right. You should get into a relationship first.

856
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:05,034
I am planning to. I'm going to find love.

857
00:56:05,063 --> 00:56:06,103
Really?

858
00:56:06,103 --> 00:56:07,333
Do you want to go on a blind date then?

859
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:10,534
Jae Hyung's friend saw your photo on social media...

860
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,174
and asked him to set you up with him.

861
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,603
That's good news.

862
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:16,143
He's the sweet man you always wanted.

863
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:18,643
He's quite good-looking, and his family is ordinary.

864
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:20,313
- What do you say? - What?

865
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:32,793
- By the way, what does he do? - He's a journalist.

866
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:34,734
That's perfect.

867
00:56:35,063 --> 00:56:36,333
Journalist?

868
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:40,304
Can he find out about an old incident then?

869
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:42,373
Excuse me.

870
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:46,243
We are doing a survey on our customers. Can you spare time?

871
00:56:47,143 --> 00:56:49,944
If you fill these out, we will give you a free side dish.

872
00:56:49,944 --> 00:56:51,714
Really? Then give it to us.

873
00:56:52,344 --> 00:56:53,614
- Thank you. - Here's the pen.

874
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:59,623
Hey, shouldn't you tick "married" box now?

875
00:57:01,194 --> 00:57:04,123
(Kim Mi So)

876
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:06,424
Number one. If you have a boyfriend,

877
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:07,933
where would you want to go with him? Write your answer.

878
00:57:07,933 --> 00:57:11,333
Number two. If you have a boyfriend, what would you like to do with him?

879
00:57:11,364 --> 00:57:13,433
Number three. If you have a boyfriend,

880
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:16,234
what would you like to get as a gift? Write your answer.

881
00:57:16,703 --> 00:57:19,504
What is this? This bossy way of speaking sounds familiar.

882
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,953
(Customer survey)

883
00:57:31,154 --> 00:57:34,554
You want me to find the one Mi So filled out.

884
00:57:34,853 --> 00:57:37,324
You could just ask her directly.

885
00:57:37,324 --> 00:57:40,764
Why would you hire the restaurant to do this?

886
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:44,504
Young Joon, I am the President.

887
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:47,364
Don't you think you shouldn't waste this highly competent man?

888
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:49,234
Just consider this as the continuation of work.

889
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:51,203
The continuation of work.

890
00:57:51,973 --> 00:57:53,703
You mean the continuation of annoyance.

891
00:57:55,214 --> 00:57:57,813
I should find him.

892
00:57:58,214 --> 00:58:00,543
I should try to find him. This is an important task.

893
00:58:00,714 --> 00:58:04,313
Jo Hee Ra. No. Kim Min Suk. No.

894
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:05,683
Kim Young Min.

895
00:58:05,784 --> 00:58:07,284
Kim Mi So.

896
00:58:07,623 --> 00:58:09,623
I found it. I found it.

897
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:14,663
- "If you have..." - What did she write?

898
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:19,603
- Very childish. - Why are you surveying this?

899
00:58:21,304 --> 00:58:23,004
Are you going to give her what she wants?

900
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:25,304
Me?

901
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:39,233
Are you training her properly or what?

902
00:58:39,303 --> 00:58:41,144
- Sir? - Will you train her sloppily?

903
00:58:41,204 --> 00:58:42,744
Don't disappoint me and do a good job.

904
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:46,274
Mr. Lee, when we were messaging each other last night, I was...

905
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,314
Let's refrain from discussing personal matters in the office.

906
00:59:42,164 --> 00:59:44,774
I will start anew.

907
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,184
Is there anything else to do?

908
01:00:09,624 --> 01:00:13,193
Yes. Now that I have a lot of time, I will look for my brother.

909
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:22,774
Yes, Mr. Park.

910
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:24,874
Tomorrow?

911
01:00:30,283 --> 01:00:32,613
Yes, Mr. Park. I'm on the way.

912
01:00:32,814 --> 01:00:33,883
Yes.

913
01:00:34,823 --> 01:00:36,084
All right.

914
01:00:56,204 --> 01:00:57,774
Why isn't he coming?

915
01:00:59,314 --> 01:01:01,783
Is Mr. Park becoming like Mr. Lee too?

916
01:01:01,983 --> 01:01:04,354
Why would he ask me to meet him on weekends?

917
01:01:08,184 --> 01:01:10,783
By the way, why is it so dark here? There's nobody around.

918
01:02:25,834 --> 01:02:28,533
Ms. Kim. Did you wait long?

919
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:31,233
What?

920
01:03:06,633 --> 01:03:09,004
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

921
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:10,744
I took you...

922
01:03:11,573 --> 01:03:13,814
on a Blockbuster date.

923
01:03:13,814 --> 01:03:15,914
- So now, - Are you going on a date?

924
01:03:16,113 --> 01:03:17,644
Can you keep it a secret?

925
01:03:20,914 --> 01:03:22,553
You scared me, Ms. Kim.

926
01:03:23,584 --> 01:03:24,894
You are really beautiful.

927
01:03:24,894 --> 01:03:26,954
If you are that worried, call her now.

928
01:03:26,954 --> 01:03:27,994
No.

929
01:03:30,363 --> 01:03:32,193
- Who is he? - It's hot.

930
01:03:32,294 --> 01:03:34,093
I got blinded by jealousy.

931
01:03:34,363 --> 01:03:35,504
Ms. Kim!
