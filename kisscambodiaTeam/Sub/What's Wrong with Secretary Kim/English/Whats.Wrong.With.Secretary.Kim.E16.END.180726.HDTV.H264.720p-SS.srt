1
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:11,805
Who...

2
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:14,335
Young Joon.

3
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:18,945
What brings you to my house?

4
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:21,245
Why do you think so?

5
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:23,276
What?

6
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:25,346
What's wrong...

7
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:28,215
with Kim Mi So?

8
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,656
Why would Young Joon do this at this hour?

9
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:36,495
What on earth are you talking about?

10
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,806
(Final Episode)

11
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,906
Here's your schedule for next week, Mr. Lee.

12
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:52,276
- Should we go for dinner later? - I would love...

13
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,215
Excuse me.

14
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:56,715
Yes, Ms. Choi?

15
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:03,255
Yes, I'll be seeing you later then.

16
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:04,986
All right.

17
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:07,895
What do you mean, you'll see her later?

18
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:10,326
She wants to have dinner together.

19
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:15,286
Well, then. She likes Japanese food, so let's go...

20
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,316
- to Illusion Hotel's Japanese... - No.

21
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:20,385
She wants to have dinner with just me, without you.

22
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:22,726
Just the two of you?

23
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:25,096
I think she wants to discuss...

24
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:26,995
the meeting of the families tomorrow with me.

25
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:32,836
If she says something inappropriate...

26
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:34,905
or makes you feel uncomfortable, tell me right away.

27
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:37,135
I will not allow her to be a tiresome mother-in-law.

28
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,346
There's no way that will happen, but I'll keep that in mind.

29
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:52,055
It's so nice...

30
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:55,825
to be eating dinner with you alone, Mi So.

31
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:57,855
Yes, I'm quite happy about it too.

32
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:01,926
To be honest, I was always jealous of my friends who had daughters...

33
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:04,036
because I have two sons.

34
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:06,465
But now I have a daughter-in-law,

35
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:08,706
so I can go shopping with you,

36
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:10,706
and eat delicious things like this.

37
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:12,805
I want us to have a real mother-daughter relationship.

38
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,076
Yes, I feel the same way.

39
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:16,505
Right?

40
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:18,916
Since we're both so pretty, everyone will think...

41
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,016
that we're mother and daughter no matter where we go.

42
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:24,685
And since I take such good care of myself,

43
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:27,456
some may even think that we're sisters, don't you think?

44
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:31,456
Yes, people could be mistaken by you, Ms. Choi.

45
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:36,266
Don't call me Ms. Choi anymore. You have to call me "Mother" now.

46
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:43,535
All right, Mother.

47
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:56,146
I wanted to buy you clothes for tomorrow's meeting,

48
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:57,486
which was why I asked you to meet me.

49
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:02,255
Pick out the one that you like.

50
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:23,005
What's the matter? You don't like any of these?

51
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:24,975
No, it's because they all look so nice.

52
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:26,446
Really?

53
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,486
- Give us all of these. - Right away.

54
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:29,815
No, there's no need.

55
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:32,785
You'll have to meet a lot of people from now on too,

56
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:34,326
so you'll need to have at least this much.

57
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:44,896
Pick out some shoes, too.

58
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:50,475
Which one of these fair beauties will be to your taste, Mi So?

59
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:52,875
This one.

60
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:54,745
That one?

61
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:58,745
Please give us all of these, including this one.

62
00:03:58,745 --> 00:03:59,745
All right.

63
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:02,446
No, I think I'll be okay with just this one.

64
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:05,185
The more, the better.

65
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:08,486
Oh yes, do you have bags, Mi So?

66
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:10,755
I do. And a lot of them, too.

67
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:12,356
- Goodness. - Yes.

68
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:14,396
So you collect bags too, I see.

69
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:15,995
I also share that hobby.

70
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:17,936
Want to shop around a bit since we're here?

71
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,735
Give us all of the new bags you have.

72
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:21,836
All right.

73
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:41,725
I'm like the Paris Hilton of Jangchung-dong.

74
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:46,655
(Vice Chairman)

75
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,636
Yes, Vice Chairman?

76
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:54,405
Did you enjoy your date with my mom?

77
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:56,365
Yes.

78
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:58,876
Why did she want to meet with you?

79
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:00,845
Well, that is...

80
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:04,115
she wanted to buy clothes for me to wear tomorrow.

81
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:09,115
I see. I should have bought those for you, but I forgot.

82
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,756
So did you pick out a pretty outfit for yourself?

83
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:17,696
Yes, well...

84
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:20,826
I'm sure it was rough accommodating your to-be mother-in-law,

85
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:22,326
so go get some rest.

86
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:24,636
See you tomorrow.

87
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:28,206
All right. Sweet dreams, Mr. Lee.

88
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:22,355
I think this on a daily basis, but you look so pretty today.

89
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,155
You look great too, Mr. Lee.

90
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,595
Oh, right.

91
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:32,936
Did Father-in-Law and your sister say they'd come separately?

92
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:35,206
Yes, they'll be here soon.

93
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:37,035
I see.

94
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:43,946
Are you nervous, by any chance?

95
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:46,746
Of course. You've seen my dad.

96
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:48,715
He's a bit peculiar,

97
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:51,415
so I'm worried that he might make a fool of himself.

98
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,155
I hope we can maintain a good atmosphere.

99
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,556
Don't worry. This is a wedding that the universe itself wants,

100
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:59,425
so the atmosphere will definitely be good.

101
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:02,095
And also, I'll be by your side.

102
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:11,175
Goodness.

103
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:16,506
Look at that. Just how many windows do they have?

104
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,115
This is incredible.

105
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,086
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

106
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,056
Hello.

107
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:25,586
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

108
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:27,686
We will escort you inside now.

109
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,186
Sure, sure.

110
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,595
Hey, what's with this atmosphere?

111
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:35,326
I know, right? Rich people really are a different breed.

112
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:37,496
- This way. - All right.

113
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,136
All right. Let's hurry.

114
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:48,045
So you're telling me that just one family lives here?

115
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,876
No, the entire family doesn't even live here together.

116
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,475
The vice chairman lives by himself.

117
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:54,316
What? Is our Mi So going to be okay?

118
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:56,715
What if they give her a hard time because she's from a poor family?

119
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,355
I did hear that they really love Mi So, but...

120
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,425
Really?

121
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,826
I'm glad that I brought you with me.

122
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:06,525
It's such a relief that we have a doctor in the family, at least.

123
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:10,295
You should've come here in your white coat,

124
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:12,095
so you could've made a stronger impression with your looks.

125
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:13,196
Come on, Dad.

126
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:16,535
How could I ever hope to one-up them, when they're rich?

127
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:17,576
Really?

128
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,905
Goodness, hello.

129
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:22,405
Let's hurry. Let's hurry.

130
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:24,646
Over there.

131
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:27,715
You've arrived.

132
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:31,256
Long time no see, rich guy.

133
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:33,556
I mean, Brother-in-Law.

134
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:38,456
- How have you been, Son-in-Law? - Good.

135
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:40,725
Are you nervous, Dad?

136
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,066
What do you mean, nervous? I'm Kim Young Man!

137
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,635
I'm a man with an iron heart who has never gotten nervous,

138
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,595
even in front of a crowd of thousands of people!

139
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:48,306
Thousands? As if.

140
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:51,635
Wasn't 100 people the biggest crowd you had, during the Doraji Festival?

141
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:53,436
Don't get nervous, my boy.

142
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,245
Rock spirit!

143
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,115
Rock spirit!

144
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,515
Hello.

145
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,715
- Nice to meet you. - This is my mother and father.

146
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:08,956
I am Mi So's father.

147
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:11,426
Hello, I'm Mi So's eldest sister.

148
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,326
- Yes, she is. The psychiatrist. - I see.

149
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:17,865
We invited you to our home since we wanted to give you a warm welcome,

150
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,235
but I'm sorry if this was rude of us.

151
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,436
No, thank you for inviting us.

152
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:25,306
- Shall we head inside then? - Yes.

153
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:26,875
All right.

154
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:06,546
We asked the steaks to be cooked medium. Is that all right?

155
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:09,586
Yes, a rocker needs to watch his figure,

156
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:11,385
since a slim figure suits him best.

157
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:14,926
So a medium-sized steak is perfect.

158
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:16,926
I don't need a large one.

159
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:23,265
Dad, she's not referring to size. She's talking about the doneness.

160
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:26,265
Medium means it's cooked medium.

161
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,166
Really?

162
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:32,135
Pardon me. I haven't eaten steak that often.

163
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:35,875
I like grilling pork ribs in a charcoal grill though.

164
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:42,046
Shall we have some pork ribs and soju together sometime, then?

165
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:43,245
That sounds great.

166
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:50,495
Shall we discuss the wedding now?

167
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:56,526
Is there a date that you had in your mind?

168
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:59,796
Any date is fine with me.

169
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:02,706
You don't have to worry about...

170
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:04,536
preparing wedding gifts.

171
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:07,745
We plan to prepare wedding gifts...

172
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,645
for her too.

173
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,946
She's so valuable to us, so we'd like to do that for her.

174
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:16,485
We'll prepare the best of the best...

175
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:19,586
from furniture and home appliances to jewelry.

176
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:23,956
You don't have a car, either.

177
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:27,926
The same model as Young Joon's car should be good enough.

178
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:33,095
It'll be good for her to live closer to her family's house.

179
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:37,005
There's an empty house near Young Joon's place.

180
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:39,735
How would you like to move into...

181
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:42,475
that house?

182
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:49,316
I...

183
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,456
can't get married this way.

184
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:08,505
I'm well aware of how much you adore me.

185
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:11,276
I'm very grateful for you.

186
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:14,676
But it's unacceptable for me...

187
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:16,446
to receive far better treatment and gifts.

188
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:29,326
Just as excessive demands, excessive kindness can be uncomfortable.

189
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,696
I'll take care of her myself.

190
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:42,436
My mistake.

191
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:46,235
I went overboard out of my adoring heart for her.

192
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:47,605
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:52,645
This is why I like her.

194
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:53,845
She's so determined.

195
00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:01,725
You've raised your daughter so well.

196
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:04,326
Thank you for thinking highly of her.

197
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,895
- When should we start eating? - Let's eat.

198
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,265
Thank you for the food.

199
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,206
Good job today.

200
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:20,505
No problem.

201
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,676
I'm worried if I was too rude...

202
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:26,916
when she only tried to express her heart for me.

203
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,245
Don't worry. What you said was reasonable enough.

204
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:33,086
I like how you keep your convictions.

205
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,095
I like how you're so understanding.

206
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,296
Now that we've set the date,

207
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:44,735
our marriage feels real.

208
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:48,765
I know. I'm going to be taken.

209
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:51,105
And you're going to have...

210
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:53,975
the one-of-a-kind man like me as your husband.

211
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:55,446
You must be happy.

212
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,115
Right, it feels like a dream.

213
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:04,586
Married woman.

214
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:06,215
Married man.

215
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,156
You forgot to put the adjective, "cool".

216
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,625
I'm going to be a cool married man.

217
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:16,326
A cool married man who never loses his abs...

218
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:19,465
as well as his sexiness.

219
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,465
- Do you agree? - Yes.

220
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:53,166
(Wedding Day)

221
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:09,086
- Where are we going? - There.

222
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:12,286
There?

223
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,926
I'm buying the newlywed tableware set which I couldn't buy last time.

224
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:16,026
Hurry.

225
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:22,765
Welcome.

226
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:24,566
I'll take the tableware set.

227
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:27,135
The one that's popular among newlywed couples.

228
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,005
Okay, please hold.

229
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:30,735
We're getting married soon.

230
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:31,836
We have a month left.

231
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:35,105
There's no need to explain the details.

232
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:37,176
I want to brag about this to everyone.

233
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:40,686
Oh, right. I'm going to buy the wok set and everything.

234
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:45,215
I didn't know you were that interested in kitchen utensils.

235
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,985
I've gotten interested along with the thought of our newlywed life.

236
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,086
I'll cook,

237
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:53,395
so don't even think about laying your hands on cooking.

238
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:56,965
Which pots should we get?

239
00:15:57,436 --> 00:16:01,066
Choose between ceramic and stainless.

240
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:02,765
- Choose the former. - The former?

241
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,336
- Then let's buy ceramic pots. - The first one is...

242
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:07,906
the business item instructed by the vice chairman last time.

243
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,145
Please proceed that way.

244
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:15,985
What were you just doing?

245
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:20,985
I received some data from the business team a while ago,

246
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,755
and I thought I should answer them quickly.

247
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:24,156
Focus, will you?

248
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:27,595
Choosing pots is more important than choosing business plans.

249
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:33,296
I'm sorry. I'll focus on choosing kitchen utensils from now on.

250
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:35,706
- All right, focus. - Okay.

251
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,276
Did you want to see me, sir?

252
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:47,446
I'm torn. What kind of choice should I make in order not to regret?

253
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:51,385
Is it about the M and A with JH Bio?

254
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:54,426
No, I've already made a decision on that matter...

255
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:56,086
after reading through all kinds of data and the market flow.

256
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:57,355
I decided not to merge with them.

257
00:16:58,926 --> 00:17:00,326
Then what is it about?

258
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:02,365
I'm choosing your wedding dress.

259
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:04,066
My dress?

260
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:07,435
Mr. Jang has sent me the pictures of dress options.

261
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:10,605
He's sent me five options, and they're all pretty, so I'm torn.

262
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:14,046
I've selected two of them.

263
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:16,405
Which one do you like more?

264
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,415
They look similar.

265
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,816
Both of them are bell line dresses.

266
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:23,145
But they feel differently.

267
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:26,685
This cheery dress reminds you of Christmas.

268
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:31,355
This modest dress reminds you of...

269
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,026
the traditional bell in Bosin Pavilion.

270
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:38,066
I think this one will look better on you.

271
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,006
Sure, I like them all.

272
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:44,536
I've given some thought about your hairstyle too.

273
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:46,576
What do you think about this?

274
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:53,576
You have a beautiful neckline, so this kind of up styles will go well.

275
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:57,256
Well, I guess.

276
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:00,216
You must be happy.

277
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:03,155
I'm the most-wanted man who's about to get sold out.

278
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,455
Plus, I'll never be in stock again.

279
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,266
And I'm helping you delicately about the wedding preparation.

280
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,296
Right, I'm happy.

281
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:14,865
Please excuse me. I have to go attend a meeting soon.

282
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,445
Hi, Young Joon.

283
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,586
It's been such a long time.

284
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:34,385
- How have you been? - Great.

285
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:37,695
You look so handsome whenever I see you.

286
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,796
Where's your fiancee?

287
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:44,566
She'll arrive soon.

288
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:47,036
I came straight here after my business outside.

289
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:48,736
Is that right?

290
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,976
Then sit down there and wait until she comes.

291
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,675
I'll go get the tuxedo and dress...

292
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:55,506
which you selected beforehand.

293
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,716
- Okay. - Go ahead.

294
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,276
Girls, follow me.

295
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:05,216
They must be so cool and pretty.

296
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:18,095
Are you on your way? Where are you?

297
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,205
I got the list of attendees for the foundation event...

298
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:23,935
when I was about to leave.

299
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,175
I think I'll have to be at the meeting.

300
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,875
What?

301
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,716
They can proceed with preparations after confirming the list.

302
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,016
I'll go right after this.

303
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:37,385
Okay, I hope you come as soon as possible.

304
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:50,595
Come in.

305
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,306
What should we do, sir?

306
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:57,635
I was waiting for it anyway. What is the trouble today?

307
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:59,006
Well...

308
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:02,576
It's the birthday of DM Corporation's president,

309
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,375
so I sent him the high quality chocolate.

310
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:09,586
But his secretary team said they didn't receive it, so I checked...

311
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:10,716
Oh, dear.

312
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:15,355
It turned out that I sent it to Ms. Choi Seo Jin, not the president.

313
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:20,996
Choi Seo Jin?

314
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:24,865
You're not talking about my ex-wife, Choi Seo Jin, are you?

315
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:27,165
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:30,605
I was mistaken because their names were close in the contact list.

317
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,076
How could you be mistaken about that?

318
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:40,076
What do you think she'd think if she got a chocolate from her ex-husband?

319
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:42,986
She'd think I was being clingy for certain.

320
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:47,155
I'm not sure if I should say this...

321
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,955
No, you shouldn't.

322
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:50,695
Still, I'll say it this time.

323
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:54,665
Don't you still have feelings...

324
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,595
for your ex-wife?

325
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,306
At least your heart could be delivered to her...

326
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:03,105
this way.

327
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:08,306
If things were going to work out between us through that chocolate,

328
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,115
we wouldn't be like this now.

329
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:15,316
Get out.

330
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:20,016
Okay, I'm sorry.

331
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:41,276
Have you seen this sensuous taken man?

332
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,976
Congratulations on taking me.

333
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:49,716
You could've lost me if you had been a little late. Don't you think so?

334
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:59,226
When on earth is she coming?

335
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:07,266
You look perfect in that tuxedo.

336
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:11,736
I'd have you wear all the clothes here if I could.

337
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:15,476
Since you were young, you've had the body...

338
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:17,016
that satisfies the clothing designer.

339
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:18,875
Thank you.

340
00:22:20,276 --> 00:22:23,685
Your fiancee is running really late. She must be busy.

341
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:27,885
Something urgent came up, but she'll come here soon.

342
00:22:28,226 --> 00:22:29,256
Is that right?

343
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:31,496
- Wait there then. - Okay.

344
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:46,976
Oh, dear.

345
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:49,875
You're here.

346
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:52,345
Sir.

347
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,345
I kept you waiting long, didn't I?

348
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:57,986
They said they'd wait a little more,

349
00:22:58,155 --> 00:23:00,855
but I couldn't make them wait any longer because I felt too sorry.

350
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:05,726
I'm sorry. I had to send out invitations by today.

351
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,895
Did you have to do it by yourself?

352
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:13,365
It's the event under your direct supervision.

353
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:16,435
A lot of politicians will be there too.

354
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:20,036
If I had known that it'd take this long,

355
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:22,776
I should've delayed the fitting date.

356
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:30,516
Aren't you hungry?

357
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:32,086
I have no appetite.

358
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:36,925
Do you want to have some coffee then?

359
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:41,996
Coffee?

360
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,806
At least it smells nice.

361
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,705
Right? I thought this place would satisfy your taste.

362
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:00,845
By the way,

363
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:04,086
I think I've been to this place before.

364
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:06,786
Did you come here with me?

365
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:08,786
Us together?

366
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:19,935
Isn't the coffee here delicious?

367
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:22,466
I searched so much to find this place.

368
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,236
Right, it's where I had my blind date before.

369
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:26,605
What, blind date?

370
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:35,615
No wonder why this place looked familiar.

371
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:41,925
Why did you have to choose this dismal place...

372
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:43,796
where you had a blind date with another man?

373
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:46,655
I forgot.

374
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:50,266
It was hectic, so I didn't remember.

375
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:53,566
All I remembered was the taste of this coffee.

376
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:56,236
Thank you for brought me here.

377
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:58,905
I was reminded of the shocking memory thanks to you.

378
00:24:59,135 --> 00:25:01,076
What do you mean by shocking memory?

379
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:04,915
I thought you tied my necktie only.

380
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:12,216
I'm sorry. It's my working habit.

381
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:13,556
Ms. Kim.

382
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:20,125
Well, that's... I didn't mean anything back there.

383
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,095
My hands reach out automatically whenever I see a crooked necktie.

384
00:25:23,095 --> 00:25:26,036
It's sort of my working habit.

385
00:25:26,595 --> 00:25:28,435
What, working habit?

386
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:32,705
Did you just call your behavior that fluttered my heart...

387
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:34,945
a habit?

388
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:37,875
That's not what I mean.

389
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:41,216
- It was an idiomatic expression. - All right, I get it.

390
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:43,855
Your hands reach out whenever you see a crooked necktie...

391
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:46,155
even if it's not mine.

392
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:49,385
I was a fool to be fallen for it.

393
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:51,395
Sir.

394
00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:53,726
I want to get out of this place right now.

395
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:56,195
I want to go to somewhere else to share our memories...

396
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,895
from here where you have memories with your blind date.

397
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:00,566
Good. Let's go share memories already.

398
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:02,905
- Hurry. - Gosh, it's suffocating.

399
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,006
Let's go.

400
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:09,746
Enjoy.

401
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:15,145
Eat some.

402
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:20,286
Is this a tip from your blind date too?

403
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:22,925
Did he say it was great to eat pizza outside like this?

404
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:28,695
No, it's where we shared our memories.

405
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:30,865
It's your favorite pizza too.

406
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:33,395
I chose this place with the thought of you.

407
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,746
Then I'll have it as a token of appreciation.

408
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:54,425
- It's hot. - It's hot.

409
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,195
Their neckties look a bit crooked.

410
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:04,165
Shouldn't you go fix them?

411
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:06,566
You're like a necktie fixer machine.

412
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:11,135
That's enough.

413
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:13,536
I can go on and on about complaining if I put my mind to it.

414
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:14,945
What?

415
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:16,375
You know that woman, right?

416
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,216
(It's fresh all the time)

417
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:22,286
Of course, I do.

418
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:24,286
Do you remember how I ran like crazy...

419
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:26,885
to buy flowers for her on her birthday?

420
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:28,756
Why are you bringing that up here?

421
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:31,855
You know that we had nothing between us.

422
00:27:31,996 --> 00:27:34,296
- To keep my image... - I'm aware.

423
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:36,296
That's why I'm not saying anything.

424
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:39,095
I know that there's nothing between you and it's all in the past.

425
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:42,105
It's not right to blame someone for what happened before going out.

426
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,405
Still...

427
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,806
- Hello, Ms. Bong. - If you don't mind,

428
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,546
can we have some soju together?

429
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:53,945
I'm not in the mood for soju today.

430
00:27:55,885 --> 00:27:57,056
Let's go with beer.

431
00:27:58,086 --> 00:27:59,086
Okay.

432
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:03,355
Are you going for a drink in this mood?

433
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:05,726
I'm going for a drink because of this mood.

434
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:07,566
Well, then.

435
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:10,466
The necktie fixer machine will leave work for today.

436
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:13,165
Go home safely, Jealousy Incarnate.

437
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:23,875
What's wrong with Kim Mi So?

438
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:29,216
Why did she put our wedding preparation aside and take me there?

439
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:30,486
Why on earth?

440
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:33,885
Judging by the story,

441
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:37,756
she put the wedding preparation aside because she was busy.

442
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:41,066
She took you to that cafe without much thinking.

443
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,526
Don't be so sensitive.

444
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:44,865
I mean, she didn't go there with her ex-boyfriend.

445
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:48,165
It was just a blind date. It's not meaningful at all.

446
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:51,976
It's not just a simple blind date.

447
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:54,276
I told you. It's where she fixed that punk's crooked necktie...

448
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:56,746
in a sweet manner.

449
00:29:00,415 --> 00:29:01,586
Right.

450
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:04,685
I can see why you're feeling upset.

451
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:09,086
She seems to be very thoughtful and careful...

452
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:11,796
on the outside,

453
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,326
but she's actually very thoughtless.

454
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:19,695
I should rather call her Thoughtless Kim from now on, right?

455
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:24,806
How dare you badmouth her in front of me?

456
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:27,675
She's like the most considerate woman in this world.

457
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:32,175
He gets mad whatever I do.

458
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:34,316
What do you want me to do then?

459
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:37,216
Just go to your house and talk with the wall if you'd be like this.

460
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:45,056
Are you really going to talk with the wall at home?

461
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:46,756
Want me to stay here longer then?

462
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:49,595
Goodbye. Don't look back and go.

463
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:52,095
Send my regards to that wall.

464
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:54,365
Bye.

465
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,746
Young Joon, that punk.

466
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:15,455
Did you forget to bring something again?

467
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:24,836
What... What brings you here?

468
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:27,466
I'm here to tell you something.

469
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:30,236
What...

470
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,105
I...

471
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:36,576
received the chocolate which you sent me.

472
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:41,246
- Oh, that... - Thank you.

473
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:45,615
You...

474
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,256
remembered.

475
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:51,455
What?

476
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:56,026
Of course I remember.

477
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:00,466
That chocolate...

478
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:05,076
I ate it for the first time when we went to France together.

479
00:31:07,046 --> 00:31:09,405
After you proposed to me,

480
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:11,076
you said you'd buy me something sweet.

481
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:13,915
Then you bought that in front of the Eiffel Tower.

482
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:17,655
Yes, I know.

483
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:20,955
I bought you that chocolate right in front of the Eiffel Tower.

484
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:23,155
But why?

485
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:27,125
Why did you send me the chocolate we had that day?

486
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:36,605
Because I want to go back to that time.

487
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:41,006
What?

488
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,016
We were happy back then, you know. We...

489
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:49,945
We loved each other so much.

490
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:53,615
I really miss that time.

491
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:58,425
I still love you very much.

492
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:06,836
Yoo Shik.

493
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:10,236
Seo Jin.

494
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:25,615
I think I should have another beer before...

495
00:32:34,895 --> 00:32:35,966
What's up?

496
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:40,736
I should just go home.

497
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:46,836
Go. Leave.

498
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:54,885
It's been a long time.

499
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:57,016
Yes, indeed.

500
00:32:59,486 --> 00:33:00,586
Yoo Shik.

501
00:33:01,786 --> 00:33:06,796
Since you've made a similar mistake in the past,

502
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:09,925
let's be cool about this...

503
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:10,996
Get lost.

504
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:13,865
And call it even.

505
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:15,006
Just get lost.

506
00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:17,135
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

507
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:20,546
Get lost, you little...

508
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,185
Young Joon can be mischievous at times.

509
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,986
Gosh, that hurts. The thorns...

510
00:33:58,175 --> 00:33:59,746
Hang on. Gosh.

511
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:02,145
Can't you figure it out?

512
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:31,915
These lamb skewers remind me of myself.

513
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:34,745
They're rotating nonstop.

514
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:38,355
I feel like I'm about to go crazy.

515
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:40,785
Did something happen?

516
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:44,526
Why did you want to grab drinks out of the blue?

517
00:34:48,526 --> 00:34:51,395
My hero and I...

518
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:54,035
had a fight.

519
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,435
My gosh, why? What did you two fight about?

520
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:04,015
Well, my hero and I went to a spicy stir-fried pork restaurant.

521
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:05,575
But the thing is,

522
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:09,986
my ex-boyfriend and I actually used to go there...

523
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:14,185
once in a while. Once in a blue moon.

524
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:16,555
You see, I didn't think anything of it.

525
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:19,596
I simply took him there because their food is so good,

526
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:22,665
but you know what happened? I ended up running into...

527
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:25,696
- my ex-boyfriend there. - My gosh.

528
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:29,636
But that jerk... Does he think we live in Hollywood or what?

529
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:33,305
As soon as he saw me, he came over...

530
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:35,875
and said hi, acting all cool.

531
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:39,216
So I had no choice but to tell him that he's my ex-boyfriend.

532
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:40,745
Then he got all mad at me.

533
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,645
He doesn't understand how I could take him...

534
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:44,285
to a place where my ex and I used to go together.

535
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:47,756
Why is he so mad about it? It's all in the past anyway.

536
00:35:47,756 --> 00:35:49,586
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

537
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:51,725
I understand why he's mad.

538
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:55,196
I get that it's all in the past,

539
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:58,395
but if your boyfriend is hurt, you're in the wrong.

540
00:36:04,176 --> 00:36:06,906
I'm the one who's upset. What's the matter with you?

541
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:08,245
Sorry?

542
00:36:08,906 --> 00:36:12,176
What's going on? Is the wedding preparation stressing you out?

543
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:15,415
No, not at all.

544
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:19,785
Here's the guobaorou you ordered.

545
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,066
Ji Ah, why do you seem so downcast these days? Is something going on?

546
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:31,136
Sorry?

547
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:33,495
No, nothing is going on.

548
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:51,386
Ji Ah, what brings you here at this hour?

549
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:55,156
Here, take it.

550
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:57,995
What is this?

551
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:03,696
This is... Isn't this guobaorou?

552
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,636
Ji Ah, I'm...

553
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:12,776
I'm not giving it to you to make you like me back.

554
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:16,676
I just thought of you when I saw guobaorou.

555
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:18,176
And...

556
00:37:19,276 --> 00:37:22,046
I'm here because there's one last thing I want to say to you.

557
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:28,486
Loving a woman...

558
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:33,325
can be put off until after you've achieved all of your goals,

559
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:39,096
but I hope you don't put off loving yourself.

560
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:42,836
Pardon me?

561
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:47,676
Stop wearing that Kori University T-shirt all the time.

562
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:49,906
Buy yourself some nice clothes.

563
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:52,745
Stop eating gimbap all the time and start taking care of your health.

564
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,616
You need to eat proper meals.

565
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:59,256
I hope you don't sacrifice your present for your future.

566
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:10,196
Anyway,

567
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:14,805
I want to see you enjoying your life like other people at our age do.

568
00:38:15,236 --> 00:38:16,665
While loving yourself.

569
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:23,716
Don't forget my advice, okay?

570
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:28,946
I think I'll keep worrying about you otherwise.

571
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,145
Why isn't she calling me?

572
00:39:00,645 --> 00:39:02,685
What if she's totally drunk like last time?

573
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:08,986
I can't let others see how cute she is when she's drunk.

574
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,796
I should pick her up.

575
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:14,625
No, I won't. I don't care.

576
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:17,035
It is her fault this time.

577
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,035
Yes, that was my fault.

578
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:30,676
I shouldn't have taken him to that cafe earlier.

579
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:39,515
Focus, will you? Choosing pots is more important...

580
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:41,156
than choosing business plans.

581
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:43,526
I kept you waiting long, didn't I?

582
00:39:43,526 --> 00:39:45,426
They said they'd wait a little more,

583
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:48,426
but I couldn't make them wait any longer because I felt too sorry.

584
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,066
I must've been out of my mind.

585
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:53,665
It's not like he's getting married alone.

586
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:00,805
Mr. Lee...

587
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:12,829
<font color="#8080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E16 What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

588
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:23,165
Mr. Lee, come out to the living room for a moment.

589
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:24,196
"Living room"?

590
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:26,395
My living room?

591
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:27,096
This is...

592
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:29,926
What is going on?

593
00:41:32,665 --> 00:41:35,336
The dress fitting was today, so I wanted to keep the promise.

594
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:42,506
I ran around to rent this dress and get my hair done at this hour.

595
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,645
I really did my best.

596
00:41:45,975 --> 00:41:48,745
To make up for all the mistakes I've made.

597
00:41:53,256 --> 00:41:54,486
So please...

598
00:41:55,785 --> 00:41:57,325
accept my sincere apology...

599
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:00,225
and forgive me now, okay?

600
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,495
I already forgave you...

601
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:06,466
the moment I saw you.

602
00:42:10,506 --> 00:42:12,506
Compared to what I've imagined in my head,

603
00:42:14,105 --> 00:42:15,906
you look about five trillion times more beautiful.

604
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:21,346
But...

605
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:23,855
please be careful from now on.

606
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:28,625
I have an exceptional memory, so every time I pass by that area,

607
00:42:28,855 --> 00:42:30,256
I will be reminded of that sight.

608
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,995
Even 10 years from now. No, even if 20 years pass.

609
00:42:34,825 --> 00:42:37,165
Actually, until the day I die...

610
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:38,665
Perhaps even after I die.

611
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:39,935
Then...

612
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:43,136
remember this until the day you die as well.

613
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:07,625
And there's something else you need to remember.

614
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:13,296
I think you look so cute...

615
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,075
even when you're all mad at me out of jealousy...

616
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:20,705
because I love you very much.

617
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,285
I won't let you go for the rest of my life.

618
00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:41,966
Even if...

619
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:45,035
your feelings for me change,

620
00:43:46,535 --> 00:43:48,006
I'll never let you go.

621
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:50,506
Brace yourself, okay?

622
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,105
Okay, I will brace myself.

623
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,566
What do you want to talk to me about?

624
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:17,265
My hero.

625
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:20,336
I wanted to apologize to you about yesterday.

626
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:23,406
It's okay.

627
00:44:25,636 --> 00:44:27,946
Don't be mad at me, please?

628
00:44:28,205 --> 00:44:30,575
Let's make things go back to the way they were.

629
00:44:30,946 --> 00:44:34,616
Be sweet to Se Ra like before. Please?

630
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:42,685
Gosh, it's so hot.

631
00:44:43,386 --> 00:44:46,196
Why did you suggest taking the stairs on this crazy hot day?

632
00:44:46,196 --> 00:44:47,696
You need to make exercise a habit.

633
00:44:48,495 --> 00:44:49,625
Be careful from now on, okay?

634
00:44:49,696 --> 00:44:52,336
If you make one more mistake,

635
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:55,636
I'm going to twist your other arm too.

636
00:44:56,305 --> 00:44:58,475
- Do you understand? - Yes, I do.

637
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:00,305
Oh, dear.

638
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:04,116
What's the matter, Ms. Bong?

639
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:07,346
I don't think that's really necessary.

640
00:45:07,716 --> 00:45:09,685
Hey, let's get out of here quickly.

641
00:45:09,886 --> 00:45:12,685
If we don't, Mr. Yang might die.

642
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:16,355
Mr. Yang, call me if you want to grab a drink.

643
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,156
Ms. Bong,

644
00:45:18,156 --> 00:45:19,855
- you keep getting more vicious. - Yes, I know.

645
00:45:22,926 --> 00:45:24,966
Oh, no. My hero.

646
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:27,906
Is your arm all right? My goodness.

647
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:30,006
My arm is all right,

648
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:32,736
but something isn't.

649
00:45:33,946 --> 00:45:35,006
Sorry?

650
00:45:36,205 --> 00:45:38,375
I think our relationship lacks sincerity.

651
00:45:40,245 --> 00:45:42,946
You see, I'm not sure...

652
00:45:43,986 --> 00:45:46,386
whether or not you really like me.

653
00:45:46,756 --> 00:45:50,625
My gosh. What on earth are you talking about now?

654
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:53,656
You took me to the restaurant you and your ex used to frequent...

655
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:55,096
as if it's not a big deal.

656
00:45:55,596 --> 00:45:58,265
And at work, you want to keep our relationship a secret.

657
00:45:59,035 --> 00:46:02,236
All of it proves that your feelings for me aren't sincere.

658
00:46:04,006 --> 00:46:06,006
Gosh, how could you say that?

659
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,375
Well, I should get back to work.

660
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:18,316
Let's make it public, then.

661
00:46:20,756 --> 00:46:21,855
What?

662
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:39,435
Attention, everyone.

663
00:46:40,906 --> 00:46:44,375
We have an important announcement to make.

664
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,745
Ms. Bong and I...

665
00:46:49,586 --> 00:46:50,685
are dating.

666
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:54,185
We know.

667
00:46:55,256 --> 00:46:56,355
- Sorry? - Sorry?

668
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:58,926
All of us have known about it.

669
00:46:59,355 --> 00:47:02,096
So don't worry about anything now and just be happy together.

670
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:06,466
And please stop doing weird things in the emergency stairwell.

671
00:47:09,906 --> 00:47:10,975
Oh, yes.

672
00:47:32,055 --> 00:47:33,765
Which one do you like the best?

673
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:35,596
Wherever it is, I don't care.

674
00:47:35,796 --> 00:47:37,995
We won't leave our hotel room anyway.

675
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:39,665
Why not?

676
00:47:39,796 --> 00:47:42,066
What are you planning to do in the hotel room?

677
00:47:49,676 --> 00:47:50,975
Mr. Lee, please.

678
00:47:51,546 --> 00:47:55,046
"Mr. Lee." Until when are you going to call me like that?

679
00:47:55,616 --> 00:47:57,616
What was that about? Oh, no.

680
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:04,995
Our wedding is in two weeks.

681
00:48:05,194 --> 00:48:07,594
Let me live until then so that I can walk down the aisle.

682
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,966
Mr. Lee, are you all right?

683
00:48:12,736 --> 00:48:13,836
Blow on it for me.

684
00:48:16,705 --> 00:48:17,805
Come on.

685
00:48:35,285 --> 00:48:38,225
(The day I'll become a married man)

686
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:42,960
13 more days to go.

687
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:47,632
Time is going by so slowly.

688
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:49,961
Go faster! I want to fast-forward to the D-Day.

689
00:48:52,794 --> 00:48:54,165
13 more days to go.

690
00:48:57,174 --> 00:48:58,935
Time is going by so slowly.

691
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,205
Go faster! I want to fast-forward to the D-Day.

692
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:24,265
Thanks for everything.

693
00:49:25,035 --> 00:49:28,365
In a few days, you won't be able to sleep next to me anymore.

694
00:49:40,136 --> 00:49:42,596
I need to practice to be able to make breakfast for Mi So.

695
00:49:44,136 --> 00:49:45,836
Mr. Lee, you must be tired.

696
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:49,236
You drove me home after working late.

697
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:51,446
I can handle feeling tired, but...

698
00:49:57,916 --> 00:50:00,856
It's so tough that I have to come home alone.

699
00:50:00,986 --> 00:50:02,086
Same here.

700
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,555
I think it was a great decision to get married early.

701
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:08,856
It was my great decision for the record.

702
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:11,026
It was my idea to get married early.

703
00:50:20,776 --> 00:50:21,836
Everyone.

704
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:26,546
I have wedding invitations.

705
00:50:29,046 --> 00:50:33,486
- Congratulations - Congratulations

706
00:50:33,486 --> 00:50:35,655
Congratulations

707
00:50:35,655 --> 00:50:39,526
Congratulations on your marriage.

708
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:50,535
It's the day before our wedding. Just go home and take rest.

709
00:50:52,606 --> 00:50:54,836
If you can't rest, I can't rest either.

710
00:50:55,405 --> 00:50:58,006
It sounds like you don't want to part from me even for a moment.

711
00:50:58,675 --> 00:50:59,946
Something like that.

712
00:51:15,296 --> 00:51:16,696
What are you doing?

713
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:21,765
I hate this.

714
00:51:40,955 --> 00:51:42,955
(My husband)

715
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,285
Your husband.

716
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:57,106
- Mr. Jung. - Yes?

717
00:51:57,436 --> 00:52:00,276
I summarized the project Mr. Lee was working on...

718
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:02,135
and the list of people in charge.

719
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:04,546
My gosh, why are you working so hard...

720
00:52:04,546 --> 00:52:06,405
the day before your wedding?

721
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:08,615
I have to get a lot done before I go.

722
00:52:08,745 --> 00:52:11,416
You might work even on your honeymoon.

723
00:52:12,086 --> 00:52:13,615
I am warning you.

724
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:15,916
While they are on honeymoon,

725
00:52:16,055 --> 00:52:17,885
no matter what happens,

726
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:21,055
don't contact Ms. Kim.

727
00:52:21,095 --> 00:52:23,095
- Do you understand? - Yes.

728
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:26,126
Go on your honeymoon with a light heart...

729
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:28,436
- and do everything you want. - Thank you.

730
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:29,566
You're welcome.

731
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:42,446
You ended up working full day.

732
00:52:42,515 --> 00:52:43,646
You are unbelievable.

733
00:52:44,086 --> 00:52:46,015
You are the same, Mr. Lee.

734
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:50,655
I made sure nothing would go wrong while you're away.

735
00:52:51,955 --> 00:52:55,055
Since you worked hard, I will give you the best honeymoon.

736
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,236
I think I won't be able to sleep well tonight.

737
00:53:00,535 --> 00:53:02,765
Do you want me to stay with you for a sweeter tomorrow?

738
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:04,805
Should we make a U-turn and go to my place?

739
00:53:05,035 --> 00:53:07,475
I am sorry, but I'm meeting with my sisters.

740
00:53:08,205 --> 00:53:10,946
I am going to spend the night with my sisters.

741
00:53:12,245 --> 00:53:15,015
Why would you see them? You'll see them tomorrow.

742
00:53:15,646 --> 00:53:17,345
You are supposed to spend the night before the wedding...

743
00:53:17,345 --> 00:53:19,015
with your family.

744
00:53:21,155 --> 00:53:22,216
I see.

745
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:25,155
Then I will gladly let them have you.

746
00:53:37,106 --> 00:53:38,135
Mi So.

747
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:39,566
I'm here.

748
00:53:40,436 --> 00:53:42,635
- Dad will stop by too. - Will he?

749
00:53:45,546 --> 00:53:47,075
You can't, Ms. Bride.

750
00:53:47,316 --> 00:53:50,115
Eat some cucumbers to fit into the dress nicely.

751
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,086
You're right.

752
00:53:54,155 --> 00:53:55,316
Are you all ready?

753
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:58,225
I told you to ask for help, but you didn't say anything.

754
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,756
You should've called us on the moving day.

755
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,225
I haven't packed yet.

756
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:05,566
I am going to move them while we are on honeymoon.

757
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,495
You would feel strange when the house is cleared.

758
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:10,095
I know.

759
00:54:11,535 --> 00:54:14,836
My gosh, I can't believe my little sister is getting married.

760
00:54:15,535 --> 00:54:18,475
Don't do this as if we are not going to see each other again.

761
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:22,916
It would've been really nice if Mom was here too. Right?

762
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:28,186
Whenever you went through an important event in your life,

763
00:54:28,885 --> 00:54:32,626
Mom wasn't there. When I think about that...

764
00:54:35,026 --> 00:54:36,995
But it was the same for you too.

765
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:42,336
Because you're the youngest, I feel unusually bad for you.

766
00:54:43,736 --> 00:54:46,166
It's okay for me not to have a mother.

767
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,506
But I feel so bad...

768
00:54:49,376 --> 00:54:51,345
that you don't have a mother.

769
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:03,986
You two are like a mother to me.

770
00:55:05,155 --> 00:55:06,896
Since I was young,

771
00:55:09,455 --> 00:55:12,896
you fed me and washed me. You prepared my lunchboxes.

772
00:55:15,696 --> 00:55:19,606
You were young too, but you tried hard to fill in Mom's space.

773
00:55:19,705 --> 00:55:21,035
I know that.

774
00:55:27,175 --> 00:55:28,316
Thank you, girls.

775
00:55:31,816 --> 00:55:33,285
You're welcome.

776
00:55:34,885 --> 00:55:38,256
Mi So, you have to live well.

777
00:55:39,425 --> 00:55:41,095
Get all the love you didn't get...

778
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:43,666
from the perfect family.

779
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:48,865
Be happy, my darling sister.

780
00:55:52,066 --> 00:55:55,106
This is crazy. I am getting emotional.

781
00:55:55,635 --> 00:55:57,376
What's wrong with me?

782
00:55:58,376 --> 00:56:00,615
- My gosh. - Girls.

783
00:56:02,716 --> 00:56:04,845
- My darling girls. - Dad.

784
00:56:05,216 --> 00:56:07,455
What's wrong with your hair?

785
00:56:07,955 --> 00:56:09,655
You are getting married tomorrow.

786
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:13,925
A lot of people will be watching. I don't want to embarrass you.

787
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:17,626
Dad, you said long hair was rock musician's pride...

788
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:19,966
and that you can't cut it short.

789
00:56:21,396 --> 00:56:23,736
Hair is rock musician's pride.

790
00:56:24,106 --> 00:56:27,006
But you are my pride.

791
00:56:30,075 --> 00:56:33,046
I don't want to do anything...

792
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:34,745
that might do you harm.

793
00:56:36,675 --> 00:56:37,916
Dad.

794
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,285
Don't cry.

795
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:46,126
The hair will grow back.

796
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:51,095
Rock spirit is never-ending.

797
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,305
All right. Shall we drink?

798
00:56:57,305 --> 00:56:58,705
- Let's drink. - I will take this empty glass.

799
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:00,535
Cheers.

800
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:05,705
Yes, ma'am.

801
00:57:05,975 --> 00:57:08,216
You could just congratulate us.

802
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,345
Why did you send such a precious gift?

803
00:57:11,946 --> 00:57:14,086
Thank you. Yes.

804
00:57:14,486 --> 00:57:17,086
And please send my regards to your husband.

805
00:57:17,586 --> 00:57:19,026
Bye.

806
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:21,925
I guess it's a gift for Mi So.

807
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:24,925
Yes. It's from Mrs. Kim, the wife of Taeyang Construction's chairman.

808
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:26,466
She's got work abroad, so she can't attend the wedding.

809
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:27,995
So she sent this instead.

810
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:31,736
By the way, wouldn't Mi So...

811
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,606
find it too uncomfortable to receive such a gift?

812
00:57:33,606 --> 00:57:35,236
I think so too.

813
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:38,106
I think we will have to be much more considerate...

814
00:57:38,405 --> 00:57:40,416
for a while.

815
00:57:43,245 --> 00:57:44,816
There's no choice then.

816
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:48,055
I should wear it.

817
00:57:58,566 --> 00:58:00,495
It's so sad.

818
00:58:06,006 --> 00:58:07,606
It suits me so well.

819
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:12,046
My goodness. It's lovely.

820
00:58:15,776 --> 00:58:18,245
- You're home. - Young Joon.

821
00:58:18,586 --> 00:58:21,316
You finally came home the day before the wedding.

822
00:58:24,686 --> 00:58:26,655
You're supposed to spend the day before the wedding...

823
00:58:26,655 --> 00:58:28,626
with your family. So I came here to greet you.

824
00:58:32,196 --> 00:58:33,365
Greet us?

825
00:58:34,066 --> 00:58:35,135
Yes.

826
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:37,966
Raising a child is hard enough,

827
00:58:38,205 --> 00:58:41,506
and yet you raised me so well. I thank you sincerely for that.

828
00:58:42,305 --> 00:58:44,946
Is it because we are getting a good daughter-in-law?

829
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:46,745
Our brusque son...

830
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:49,716
just thanked us with kind words.

831
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:51,446
I know.

832
00:59:04,265 --> 00:59:05,466
It's already tomorrow.

833
00:59:06,066 --> 00:59:07,236
Congratulations on your marriage.

834
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:16,106
You're leaving soon, aren't you?

835
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:18,205
Are you going back to France?

836
00:59:19,546 --> 00:59:20,575
No.

837
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,586
I am just going to...

838
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:27,155
travel around wherever my legs take me.

839
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:29,186
Travel?

840
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:31,856
I will find myself through this trip.

841
00:59:32,925 --> 00:59:35,896
I will walk around until I get tired and go back to my place.

842
00:59:36,256 --> 00:59:39,365
I thought I might be better then.

843
00:59:41,595 --> 00:59:42,696
I see.

844
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:47,336
Then will you be coming back with a new book?

845
00:59:49,106 --> 00:59:50,175
Maybe.

846
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:55,916
I will wait for you.

847
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:06,686
Why are you looking at me like that?

848
01:00:09,455 --> 01:00:11,995
It's my first time to hear you say that to me.

849
01:00:19,566 --> 01:00:21,075
I feel like not letting you down.

850
01:00:22,236 --> 01:00:23,376
I will try my best.

851
01:00:28,546 --> 01:00:31,385
Right. Thank you for the wedding gift.

852
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:35,115
You got rich from your royalties, so you got us a big gift.

853
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:36,486
I appreciate it.

854
01:00:38,686 --> 01:00:42,995
I told the parents not to receive flowers at the wedding tomorrow.

855
01:00:43,495 --> 01:00:46,166
I thought Mother and Father didn't know about it.

856
01:00:46,566 --> 01:00:47,635
Flowers?

857
01:00:48,865 --> 01:00:49,936
Why not?

858
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:53,876
What do you mean? Mi So is allergic to flowers.

859
01:00:55,575 --> 01:00:56,575
What?

860
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:17,725
(My husband)

861
01:01:22,066 --> 01:01:24,865
I told them to replace all the flowers and the bouquet...

862
01:01:24,865 --> 01:01:26,365
with artificial flowers.

863
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:29,305
I am sorry I didn't know that you're allergic to flowers.

864
01:01:29,905 --> 01:01:32,776
I will try my best to get to know more about you.

865
01:01:37,086 --> 01:01:38,186
Thank you.

866
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:40,885
I will try to know more about you too.

867
01:01:41,455 --> 01:01:42,515
My husband.

868
01:01:42,515 --> 01:01:44,155
(I will try to know more about you too, my husband.)

869
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:45,825
"My husband"?

870
01:01:45,825 --> 01:01:48,055
(Thank you. I will try to know more about you too, my husband.)

871
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,575
It's past midnight.

872
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:09,515
Today our relationship as a boyfriend and girlfriend ends,

873
01:02:09,515 --> 01:02:10,916
and our marriage begins.

874
01:02:11,785 --> 01:02:14,716
Thank you for making me get sold out.

875
01:02:39,332 --> 01:02:40,702
By the way, your hair...

876
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:45,533
Yes. I wanted to look clean, so I decided to cut it.

877
01:02:46,871 --> 01:02:50,411
It's too bad. Your long hair was great.

878
01:02:50,912 --> 01:02:53,013
I wanted to grow my hair just like you.

879
01:02:54,113 --> 01:02:55,713
Stop talking nonsense.

880
01:02:57,713 --> 01:03:00,452
The thought of marrying off your precious little daughter...

881
01:03:00,452 --> 01:03:02,283
must've kept you up all night.

882
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:05,653
Yes. We drank soju together last night,

883
01:03:05,653 --> 01:03:07,522
and we struggled to get up this morning.

884
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:11,161
Dad, please stop.

885
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,832
I am very excited for this wedding.

886
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:20,641
Yes. I am thrilled to see how beautiful Mi So is.

887
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:26,743
The weather is beautiful.

888
01:03:33,312 --> 01:03:34,452
How did you two...

889
01:03:36,852 --> 01:03:39,452
You have a big mouth, so I didn't tell you.

890
01:03:39,823 --> 01:03:41,122
We got back together.

891
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:45,292
Really? Congratulations.

892
01:03:46,263 --> 01:03:48,662
Right. I am so sorry about the last time.

893
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:49,702
I made a mistake and delivered chocolate to...

894
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:50,732
Hey.

895
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:54,903
Well done working overtime.

896
01:03:55,642 --> 01:03:56,772
Right.

897
01:03:58,843 --> 01:04:00,513
I am really happy right now.

898
01:04:01,113 --> 01:04:03,952
So shall we delay today's mistake until tomorrow?

899
01:04:05,982 --> 01:04:07,122
Please do that.

900
01:04:08,522 --> 01:04:09,582
Let's go.

901
01:04:14,263 --> 01:04:15,323
Ms. Seol.

902
01:04:16,162 --> 01:04:17,432
- You're here. - Yes.

903
01:04:17,763 --> 01:04:19,792
By the way, you look really happy today.

904
01:04:20,093 --> 01:04:22,332
I am determined to eat a lot today.

905
01:04:22,602 --> 01:04:24,602
There's going to be so many delicious foods.

906
01:04:24,932 --> 01:04:27,673
I am going to stop being on a diet and go crazy.

907
01:04:27,673 --> 01:04:29,903
You have so much swag today.

908
01:04:30,443 --> 01:04:31,912
Let's eat a lot together.

909
01:04:51,633 --> 01:04:52,763
Your outfit.

910
01:04:54,633 --> 01:04:58,473
I have my first date today, so I got new clothes.

911
01:05:01,073 --> 01:05:02,243
First date?

912
01:05:05,343 --> 01:05:08,443
Do you have a girlfriend?

913
01:05:10,912 --> 01:05:12,952
If it's still available.

914
01:05:14,053 --> 01:05:15,223
Your love.

915
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:18,022
What?

916
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:24,033
Then you mean...

917
01:05:27,702 --> 01:05:29,102
Go on a date with me today.

918
01:05:32,473 --> 01:05:34,702
All right. I would love to.

919
01:05:36,002 --> 01:05:40,142
Should we go and drink Caramel Macchiato you like?

920
01:05:40,982 --> 01:05:42,283
Anything would be fine.

921
01:05:42,843 --> 01:05:44,752
Vending machine coffee is good too.

922
01:05:44,752 --> 01:05:47,082
Even tab water would be good.

923
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:57,792
Let's go.

924
01:06:03,332 --> 01:06:04,803
Are you that anxious and nervous?

925
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,843
The person who is anxious and nervous seems to be you.

926
01:06:19,883 --> 01:06:21,023
What are you talking about?

927
01:06:21,122 --> 01:06:23,423
I have given a speech in front of thousands of people.

928
01:06:23,893 --> 01:06:26,963
I didn't get nervous even when I was signing contract worth millions.

929
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:30,633
What's wrong with my leg?

930
01:06:33,263 --> 01:06:36,402
If you are that nervous, I will hold your hand.

931
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:46,372
My sisters got me tranquilizers. Do you want them?

932
01:06:48,742 --> 01:06:51,082
I don't need them, but if you want to give them to me,

933
01:06:51,983 --> 01:06:54,023
- I will take them. - It's in my bag.

934
01:07:00,822 --> 01:07:02,023
Drink slowly.

935
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:07,832
Let's calm down.

936
01:07:08,202 --> 01:07:09,502
Do you feel a little better?

937
01:07:19,412 --> 01:07:22,412
- Clink. - Your outfit looks amazing.

938
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:27,223
I won't let this happen.

939
01:07:27,353 --> 01:07:29,853
You have a great style.

940
01:07:30,523 --> 01:07:31,692
Look.

941
01:07:31,692 --> 01:07:33,252
It's Oh Ji Ran, the model.

942
01:07:33,992 --> 01:07:35,523
- It's Oh Ji Ran. - Hello.

943
01:07:35,963 --> 01:07:37,063
I am your fan.

944
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:39,093
- You are so beautiful. - Thank you.

945
01:07:45,572 --> 01:07:46,702
It's Oh Ji Ran.

946
01:07:46,872 --> 01:07:49,702
Ms. Oh, this seat is empty. You can sit here.

947
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:51,612
Okay.

948
01:07:54,513 --> 01:07:55,582
Hello.

949
01:07:56,343 --> 01:07:57,782
It's an honor.

950
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:03,152
Ji Ran, I am your big fan.

951
01:08:03,152 --> 01:08:06,053
I only drink the soju you advertised.

952
01:08:06,053 --> 01:08:08,292
- Me too. - Thank you.

953
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,362
Thank you.

954
01:08:09,362 --> 01:08:13,933
I am sorry to say this, but can we take a photo together?

955
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:15,463
Of course we can.

956
01:08:15,463 --> 01:08:18,973
Thank you. You are beautiful inside and out.

957
01:08:19,133 --> 01:08:21,542
Let's take a photo. 1, 2.

958
01:08:24,773 --> 01:08:26,773
- Thank you. - By the way, Ji Ran,

959
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:29,383
who are you here for?

960
01:08:29,383 --> 01:08:31,152
Who did you come to congratulate?

961
01:08:33,353 --> 01:08:36,822
I didn't come to congratulate them.

962
01:08:38,523 --> 01:08:41,662
I didn't know Mi So was so bad. She's a big liar.

963
01:08:42,223 --> 01:08:44,933
She said she wasn't dating Young Joon.

964
01:08:46,662 --> 01:08:47,862
I am going to take revenge on her.

965
01:08:48,402 --> 01:08:51,473
It's a taboo to wear a white dress at a wedding, but I wore it.

966
01:08:51,473 --> 01:08:53,173
I am going to look prettier than the bride and pay her back.

967
01:08:53,173 --> 01:08:54,202
And I'll get my revenge!

968
01:08:59,112 --> 01:09:01,813
- Hello, hello. - Hello, Ms. Seol.

969
01:09:05,713 --> 01:09:06,952
Aren't you Ms. Ji Ran?

970
01:09:09,383 --> 01:09:10,393
Yes.

971
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:12,152
I'm a huge fan of yours.

972
01:09:12,752 --> 01:09:14,393
You're even prettier than me.

973
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,723
Goodness, I'm so happy to meet you!

974
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,192
- Goodness. - Oh no!

975
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,902
You must be out of your mind!

976
01:09:22,902 --> 01:09:26,072
What am I going to do now? I was supposed to get revenge!

977
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:27,343
Gosh!

978
01:09:30,673 --> 01:09:32,473
You left your bag, Ms. Ji Ran.

979
01:09:35,313 --> 01:09:37,053
- I apologize. - Yes, please leave.

980
01:09:37,053 --> 01:09:38,912
It's fine. I took a photo already.

981
01:09:40,252 --> 01:09:41,983
- I took a photo. - Goodness.

982
01:09:45,093 --> 01:09:46,152
Are you okay?

983
01:09:49,893 --> 01:09:51,862
Please get ready to make your entrance.

984
01:09:52,862 --> 01:09:53,963
- All right. - All right.

985
01:09:55,963 --> 01:09:57,072
Let's go.

986
01:10:12,353 --> 01:10:15,622
The ceremony will begin soon,

987
01:10:16,152 --> 01:10:19,122
so please take your seats, everyone.

988
01:10:19,122 --> 01:10:20,263
I'm so excited.

989
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:22,292
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

990
01:10:32,002 --> 01:10:34,542
Goodness, my hero.

991
01:10:42,983 --> 01:10:46,952
Then, the wedding of the groom, Lee Young Joon...

992
01:10:47,282 --> 01:10:50,553
and the bride, Kim Mi So,

993
01:10:51,023 --> 01:10:52,252
will now begin.

994
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:24,023
I'll protect you like this for the rest of my life.

995
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,093
I promise you that.

996
01:11:35,803 --> 01:11:38,473
What is it? Don't you think that I'll be able to keep my promise?

997
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:41,242
No, it's not that.

998
01:11:42,143 --> 01:11:44,713
I know that you're someone who keep your promises...

999
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:47,282
than anyone.

1000
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,652
You've kept each and every promise you made to me...

1001
01:11:54,483 --> 01:11:56,923
ever since we were young.

1002
01:12:01,093 --> 01:12:03,763
Hurry up and promise me that you'll marry me.

1003
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,532
- I can't. - Why not?

1004
01:12:06,902 --> 01:12:10,063
Because marriage is for two grown-ups who love each other.

1005
01:12:10,402 --> 01:12:11,973
Then you can just love me...

1006
01:12:11,973 --> 01:12:14,643
after the two of us become adults!

1007
01:12:17,912 --> 01:12:19,513
All right, fine. Let's do it.

1008
01:12:20,843 --> 01:12:22,483
Promise me.

1009
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:25,252
I'll come back here to see you again, Mi So.

1010
01:12:25,252 --> 01:12:28,652
- You'll really come see me, right? - Yes.

1011
01:12:39,233 --> 01:12:42,002
Will the bride and groom please enter?

1012
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:45,532
Let's go.

1013
01:12:58,252 --> 01:12:59,383
Congratulations!

1014
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:03,383
- Congratulations! - Gosh!

1015
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,162
Mi So!

1016
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:11,563
What a handsome groom!

1017
01:14:54,563 --> 01:14:57,372
You are my world, and every moment of my life.

1018
01:14:59,532 --> 01:15:01,072
And every moment of my life...

1019
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:04,194
was you.

1020
01:15:05,994 --> 01:15:08,065
(Thank you to all of the viewers of "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim".)
