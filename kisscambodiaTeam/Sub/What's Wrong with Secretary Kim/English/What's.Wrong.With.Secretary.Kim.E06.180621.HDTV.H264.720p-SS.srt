1
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:21,042
Ms. Kim.

2
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:22,911
Yes?

3
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:25,641
A while ago,

4
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,121
you told me never to stir you up again.

5
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:36,721
That was...

6
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,062
I...

7
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,372
want to stir you up.

8
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,011
What?

9
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,141
That's...

10
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,521
Please don't do this!

11
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:45,161
Little child,

12
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:47,262
please watch me go.

13
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:49,292
No!

14
00:02:09,182 --> 00:02:10,321
Ms. Kim!

15
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,432
Ms. Kim, I will explain.

16
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:21,661
I can explain.

17
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:23,862
- This is... - I just remembered.

18
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:26,462
I just remembered who you are and what kind of a person you are.

19
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:29,432
What do you mean?

20
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:32,142
You are a narcissist who only loves himself.

21
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:34,671
You think everyone else is just a background.

22
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,671
"How dare you think of having me?" That's what flashed in your mind.

23
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:38,082
That's why you pushed me, right?

24
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,552
Ms. Kim, you are mistaken. It's not like that.

25
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,251
Mr. Lee, you know what?

26
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:46,821
If someone asks me when I had my first kiss,

27
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:49,652
I would have to choose between when a kid named Sang Cheol...

28
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:52,691
kissed me as a joke in kindergarten and this moment.

29
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:59,432
Ms. Kim.

30
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:03,772
- Mr. Lee. - Yes?

31
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,872
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.

32
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,041
- What? - I don't think...

33
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,411
I can manage to look at your face.

34
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:14,381
I'll get going then.

35
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,221
Wait, Ms. Kim.

36
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,691
By the way, I'm done for the day.

37
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,631
Don't you dare follow me.

38
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:48,751
I'm glad she has no clue about it.

39
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,622
I'm not glad at all.

40
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:53,552
This is not how it's supposed to go.

41
00:04:00,462 --> 00:04:02,731
(Episode 6)

42
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:07,971
So he pushed you as soon as your lips touched.

43
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:10,302
Yes. So I...

44
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:17,681
I read it on the internet. And I couldn't believe it.

45
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:20,111
Do you have any idea as to why he did that?

46
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,382
I do. It sounds like he has a sexual desire disorder.

47
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,582
What? Sexual what?

48
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:26,382
It's nothing to be surprised about.

49
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:30,252
A lot of young men come to our clinic with that issue.

50
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:33,262
They are so stressed out...

51
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:35,161
that their bodies reject it. It's like that.

52
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,532
You're being ridiculous.

53
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:40,801
I am not. Suffering from sexual dysfunction is no crime.

54
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:48,241
In my opinion, I think it's a psychological problem.

55
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,212
- What? - He showed...

56
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:52,842
such an extreme behavior right before the kiss.

57
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:55,551
I think he's traumatized by either women or kiss.

58
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,382
And that caused him to show a rejection symptom.

59
00:04:58,322 --> 00:04:59,481
"Traumatized"?

60
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:07,692
Should we go for another round?

61
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,592
Let's go!

62
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:13,772
Stop, girls. I will stop here.

63
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,301
What? We have to go for one more drink.

64
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:19,072
Please cut me some slack. Tomorrow is my day off.

65
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:22,772
That's why you have to drink until you nearly die.

66
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:25,842
When will you have another chance like this?

67
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:29,782
No. I can't spend my sweet day off recovering from hangover.

68
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:32,452
I'm going to have a blast tomorrow.

69
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:33,991
I'll get going then.

70
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:41,661
Take care going home.

71
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:47,371
You know that story Mi So read on the internet.

72
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:52,671
I think it's about Mi So and Mr. Lee.

73
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:54,212
Mi So and Mr. Lee?

74
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:59,981
Are you saying that rich man suffers from sexual dysfunction?

75
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,111
Can't a rich man suffer from sexual dysfunction?

76
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,221
Stop!

77
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:07,291
That's not the point, is it?

78
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:10,822
The point is that there's something going on between the two.

79
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:25,072
He showed such an extreme behavior right before the kiss.

80
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:28,241
I think he's traumatized by either women or kiss.

81
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:31,342
Perhaps...

82
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:34,981
there might be a reason for it.

83
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:43,491
What if there was?

84
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,892
My gosh, you are funny.

85
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:50,192
Ms. Kim, you must've...

86
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:51,931
been really excited to kiss me.

87
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,731
Since you anticipated it so much, you must've been very disappointed.

88
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:05,212
(Miss Kim, you must've been...)

89
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,952
Ms. Kim, I am sorry.

90
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:15,551
(Ms. Kim, I am sorry.)

91
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:17,991
The simpler the better.

92
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,161
The first step is always the hardest. It gets easy after.

93
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:27,101
Saying sorry isn't so difficult now.

94
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:41,311
(Ms. Kim, I am sorry.)

95
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,551
Sorry? Did something happen between us?

96
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:18,551
I don't know what you are sorry about.

97
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:21,221
What happened between us?

98
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:24,991
Is she going to forget that sweet yet dynamic moment?

99
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:26,762
This sentence is very tough to interpret.

100
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:29,491
What do I say?

101
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:50,882
Your secretary is here.

102
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:57,262
Why? Why did she come when it's her day off?

103
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:00,091
She must've felt uncomfortable too.

104
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,382
Why are you here so early in the morning, Mr. Yang?

105
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:25,382
Don't you usually wait outside?

106
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:26,752
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:29,321
But Ms. Kim told me that she can't come to work today,

108
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:30,461
so she asked me to...

109
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,532
tie your tie for you in her stead.

110
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:38,102
- What? - She told me...

111
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,232
that there's nobody to tie it for you if she's not here.

112
00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:45,972
No! Stop right there.

113
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,211
- Don't come any closer. - I can do it well.

114
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,081
No.

115
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,152
Just stay still.

116
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,451
I'll do it for you, sir.

120
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,472
Mr. Lee!

121
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:38,722
Since you've worked as hard as a cow all this time,

122
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,191
I'm giving you a stuffed cow.

123
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,862
Its name is "Hardworking Cow".

124
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,201
Hey, Hardworking Cow.

125
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,171
Let's not look at each other today.

126
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:55,571
It's because you keep reminding me of someone.

127
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,482
Oh gosh!

128
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:29,541
Why did I close my eyes? Why?

129
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:33,242
How embarrassing!

130
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,291
I apologize for being late!

131
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,091
Goodness.

132
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:47,732
You're 14 whole minutes late.

133
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:48,732
I apologize.

134
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:50,661
Hey, now. Are you starting to slack off already...

135
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:52,002
because Ms. Kim isn't here?

136
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,232
No, it's not that.

137
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:55,532
My family moved to Yangpyeong last week,

138
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,441
so I live quite far from work now.

139
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:58,671
Hey.

140
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:00,242
Stop talking about your family affairs...

141
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:01,311
that nobody is interested in...

142
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:02,541
and get ready to work.

143
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:04,341
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:09,411
I'm going to a real estate agent later to find a new place to live.

145
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,581
I'm thinking of getting my own place somewhere near work.

146
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,181
If I do that, I'll never be late again.

147
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:14,622
Stop talking about your living affairs...

148
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:16,622

Yes, ma'am.

151
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:27,632
By the way, why is Ms. Kim taking a day off?

152
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:30,841
I don't know. Maybe something is going on with her?

153
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:31,941
Nothing is going on with her.

154
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:34,211
Hello, sir.

155
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:36,612
Stop talking about someone who isn't here,

156
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,911
but work harder to make up for the fact that she isn't here.

157
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,681
- Yes, sir. - Yes sir, do not worry.

158
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,152
- I'll be going now. - Go ahead.

00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:41,732
Mr. Morpheus.

183
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:43,502
Goodness!

184
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:47,041
- Yes. - Hello.

185
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:48,911
I'm your fan, Mr. Morpheus.

186
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:53,142
It truly is an honor to be seeing you in person like this.

187
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:55,282
What's going on here?

188
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:11,902
I'll be going, then.

189
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:13,402
- All right. - Sure.

190
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,772
Goodness gracious.

191
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:22,341
I finally understand why Morpheus hid his face all this time.

192
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:24,612
It must have been because he was just too handsome.

193
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,512
As soon as he unveils himself...

194
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:28,482
gosh, my heart is racing.

195
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:29,911
He's so cool.

196
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,722
Doesn't he seem exactly like the type who is a bestselling author?

197
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:35,492
I didn't really care for his novels, though.

198
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:37,161
Aren't they mostly catered to women?

199
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,522
What are you saying?

200
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,961
It's because everyone likes them that he's a bestselling author!

201
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:43,061
Yes, that's right. His books are such page-turners...

202
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:44,461
that you lose all perception of time.

203
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,532
By the way, Mr. Morpheus came by the other day and now today.

204
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:52,171
Maybe he's close with the vice chairman?

205
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,642
I don't think so.

206
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,112
Didn't it feel like there was some tension in the air just now?

207
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,181
Perhaps.

208
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,112
What kind of relationship do those two have, though?

209
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:01,852
I know...

210
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,282
their huge secret.

211
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:09,722
You see, those two are...

212
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,821
brothers.

213
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:12,821
- What? - What?

214
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:14,532
The author Morpheus...

215
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:17,102
is the eldest son of the chairman of Yumyung Group!

216
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:30,211
I just stopped by the Planning Department's meeting.

217
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,652
I took a look at their plan, and the concept didn't seem too bad.

218
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:36,681
You don't need to report those kinds of things to me...

219
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:39,681
because that is just one of the many projects that my company is running.

220
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:41,992
Do you really have to phrase it like that?

221
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:43,791
It's merely the truth.

222
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:47,532
Well, fine.

223
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:50,161
I'm sure this is nothing to you, since you're so high and mighty.

224
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:53,671
But I don't think Mother and Father have the same attitude toward this.

225
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:56,472
The two of them are quite happy about the fact...

226
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:58,002
that we're working together.

227
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:02,372
That's why I came.

228
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:04,811
To tell you not to unnecessarily stir the pot and create strife...

229
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,881
when they think we've made amends, and are so happy about it.

230
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,651
Isn't that something that you should be telling yourself?

231
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,321
What?

232
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:16,591
Because I'm not the one who creates strife.

233
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:37,782
Did Ms. Kim Mi So go somewhere?

234
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:41,311
She's using her paid time off today.

235
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,012
I see.

236
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:46,752
I'm a member of your fanclub and a Morpheusian.

237
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:50,222
And my username is "FallenForMorpheus".

238
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:51,621
Do you remember me, by any chance?

239
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:53,361
I've made a lot of posts on the fan cafe.

240
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,831
I'm sorry. I'll be sure to remember from now on.

241
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:58,262
I'll remember this too. Forever.

242
00:17:58,262 --> 00:17:59,601
Mr. Author!

243
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:02,331
Could you give us your autograph?

244
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,002
- Make it out to "Bong Se Ra." - And "Lee Young Ok."

245
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:05,301
Me... me too, please.

246
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:06,702
Me too, please!

247
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,071
(Distant Afternoon)

248
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:10,742
Please give me your autograph.

249
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:15,651
Goodness, when did you buy that?

250
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,881
You didn't even take off the plastic.

251
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:20,551
- Bong Se Ra. - Lee Young Ok.

252
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:22,291
FallenForMorpheus.

253
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,492
- Just a second. - Move.

254
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:25,321
Please give me your autograph.

255
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:38,672
Good thing Ms. Kim used her paid time off today.

256
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:50,252
Yes, Ms. Kim?

257
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:53,482
Yes, I'll made adjustments to his schedule.

258
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:55,222
Yes.

259
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:58,361
By the way, what are you doing on your day off?

260
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:01,992
What? Why are you staying at home?

261
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:04,301
Well, all right.

262
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:07,301
Call me if you need anything. Okay, bye.

263
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:10,972
She should go hang out with someone on a day like today.

264
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:16,172
Is there anything you need?

265
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:22,651
Cancel all my schedule today. I have an urgent business.

266
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:25,952
Okay.

267
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:30,891
No one replies my text, and I have nothing to do.

268
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:37,901
If I think about it, I don't have anyone to hang out with or plans...

269
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:40,472
on a day like today all because of the vice chairman.

270
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:43,871
It's because I have to set everything in my life to him.

271
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:45,702
Goodness, Vice Chairman.

272
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:46,841
Are you talking about me?

273
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,182
Gosh, you...

274
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:53,651
I mean, what brings you here?

275
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:05,022
I thought you'd think about me like you do now, so I came here...

276
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,121
to see you myself.

277
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,032
Shall we hang out together today?

278
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:14,032
- What? - I took my day off today...

279
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,702
to hang out with you.

280
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:18,641
You don't have to.

281
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:20,611
I'm busy today.

282
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:24,912
You seem to be just walking around the neighborhood, so what's so busy?

283
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,952
I'm busy walking around the neighborhood.

284
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,922
What?

285
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:32,922
How did you know that I was home?

286
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:34,492
I heard Ji Ah talked to you on the phone.

287
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:38,321
Be honest. You wanted me to come see you, didn't you?

288
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:41,992
You're great in every way,

289
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,492
but you're great at getting wrong ideas too.

290
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:46,331
Right, I'm great in every way, so trust me and leave your day to me.

291
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:48,502
I'll entertain you today.

292
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:51,341
I'm busy today.

293
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:55,641
I plan to go somewhere further from here from now on.

294
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,282
In those clothes?

295
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,022
Give me a chance to make up for it.

296
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,662
Especially for you,

297
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,232
I've planned out a schedule too.

298
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:19,932
We'll eat at a premium lounge restaurant...

299
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:21,601
as we listen to an orchestra's performance.

300
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:23,101
We'll get on a yacht to have some cruise time.

301
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:25,972
We'll move quickly to the airport from the riverside by a helicopter.

302
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:27,172
We'll go to Japan on my private plane.

303
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:29,311
We'll have sushi for our late night snack and come back.

304
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:30,442
Hold on.

305
00:21:31,212 --> 00:21:33,141
I have no intention to do all that.

306
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:38,081
Why?

307
00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:40,081
It's my holiday today.

308
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,351
I'll spend the day as I please.

309
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,291
I won't do as you say.

310
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,391
Then I'll do as you say for today.

311
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:49,662
- You won't be able to. - I will.

312
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:51,162
- You won't. - I will.

313
00:21:58,502 --> 00:21:59,601
Well, then.

314
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:11,022
- You want to go on a bus trip? - Yes.

315
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:14,752
Not a trip to Europe or the Mediterranean,

316
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:17,192
but a trip on which you take a bus and tour around the city?

317
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,121
- You mean, that kind of trip? - Yes.

318
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,732
Ms. Kim.

319
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:26,762
Don't try to go against my style, and just do what you want to do.

320
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:28,801
That's what I really want to do.

321
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:31,641
I always get on crowded buses on my way to or from work.

322
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,442
I've wanted to travel on bus to its final destination...

323
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:37,012
in broad daylight without much thought.

324
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:42,351
But it must be hard for you...

325
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:45,621
because you hate to ride on a car driven by a stranger.

326
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:48,452
That's why you always make me drive for you whenever you have a drink.

327
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,762
It's hard for you to do this, isn't it?

328
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,202
Let's go.

329
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:05,472
Are you really going to ride on this?

330
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,871
I told you that I'd do what you want today.

331
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:09,772
Really?

332
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:15,182
I'll pay the bus fare.

333
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,811
Two people, please.

334
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:19,782
Not enough money.

335
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:24,662
Does it inform you of this humiliating information too?

336
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:26,692
I'll pay.

337
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:29,162
Here.

338
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:50,051
This was designed without considering tall people like me.

339
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:51,782
Hold this.

340
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:58,692
Sit here.

341
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:00,861
No, you should sit...

342
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,831
Never mind. I'll sit.

343
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:22,182
Did you just see that? He has such weak legs.

344
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:26,551
You should've sit here instead if you'd be like this.

345
00:24:29,522 --> 00:24:30,922
He must have no strength in his legs.

346
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,472
The sun is still up.

347
00:24:49,472 --> 00:24:50,541
I know.

348
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,381
The weather is hot, so why don't we go have some chicken and beer?

349
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:55,381
I can't.

350
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:57,282
I have to go see a realty dealer to look for a new house.

351
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,252
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay, bye.

352
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:02,192
You're going, right?

353
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,091
Chicken and beer, my foot.

354
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,522
Gosh, Mr. Ko.

355
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:09,861
We're having some chicken and beer over there. You want to join?

356
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:12,101
You just said you wouldn't go.

357
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:13,331
When did I?

358
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:15,202
You'll go with us, right?

359
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:17,742
Let's go release our stress from today's work.

360
00:25:18,472 --> 00:25:21,242
Working is best to release your stress in my opinion.

361
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:22,972
Nothing is better than finishing off the work perfectly...

362
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,482
when it comes to blowing out your stress.

363
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,282
Enjoy yourselves then.

364
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:29,412
Maybe next time.

365
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:30,651
Well, then.

366
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:33,081
Let's go for some chicken and beer already.

367
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,151
I'm not going.

368
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:37,462
You just said you wanted to go for it to cool off from the heat.

369
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:40,631
I said I wanted to go drink with Mr. Ko,

370
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:42,432
not with you.

371
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:45,561
You're so slow-witted. Goodness.

372
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:47,571
Gosh, I just want to flick her on the forehead like this...

373
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:50,232
if I can.

374
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:57,912
It's clean and nice.

375
00:25:57,912 --> 00:25:59,982
- Can I move in right away? - Sure.

376
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:02,512
Oh, right. Do you want to check out the rooftop too?

377
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:03,651
It's got a great view.

378
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:05,182
Can I use the rooftop too?

379
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:07,851
Sure. It's for public use.

380
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:09,851
A young man lives in the rooftop house,

381
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:13,361
and he's made a small garden to grow lettuce and cherry tomatoes.

382
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:16,732
He must be very diligent.

383
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:19,732
He is diligent and frugal.

384
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:21,502
He has such strong vitality.

385
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:24,272
His monthly rent was originally 500 dollars with a deposit of 10,000.

386
00:26:24,442 --> 00:26:27,412
He persuaded the landlord real hard and made it down to 420.

387
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:28,811
Is that right?

388
00:26:29,942 --> 00:26:32,712
I'll follow you after this call. Go look around the rooftop first.

389
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:33,912
Okay.

390
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,192
It came off again.

391
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:49,861
My suit keeps getting worn out because I have no other suits.

392
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:52,032
What a miser.

393
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,242
Mr. Ko.

394
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:05,782
Why you...

395
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:09,881
What are you doing here? Did you stalk me?

396
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:11,722
What? That's not it.

397
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:13,452
Right, I only have one suit.

398
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:16,151
What's so curious about it that you followed me here?

399
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:17,762
I didn't stalk you.

400
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,222
I'm here for househunting.

401
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,762
I want to live in one of the studios here.

402
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,032
What?

403
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,601
Well, goodbye.

404
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:32,742
Hold on.

405
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:38,541
People think I'm workaholic and hot,

406
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,581
and I'm the most charming male employee in Yumyung Group.

407
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,412
If you ruin that image of mine,

408
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:45,452
I won't let it slide.

409
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:51,262
Don't worry.

410
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:59,462
Can I ask you about something?

411
00:28:01,032 --> 00:28:02,672
What on earth happened about the button?

412
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:04,571
I'm sure you dropped the button at that time.

413
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:08,311
In case of emergency,

414
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,311
I bought a lot of spares beforehand.

415
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:34,002
What great food you want to have...

416
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:35,502
that you're making us travel this far?

417
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:38,541
We're going to my favorite restaurant.

418
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:40,101
It's there.

419
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:42,212
(Go Skin)

420
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:46,242
"Go Skin"?

421
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:49,212
It really makes me want to go home.

422
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,551
Then go home.

423
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,121
I'm going to where you're going.

424
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:55,651
I told you I'd do everything you want today.

425
00:29:11,272 --> 00:29:13,401
Excuse me. Can we have two servings of pork skin?

426
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:14,512
Okay.

427
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:35,162
Try some.

428
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:50,186
<font color="#8080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E06 What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?</font> 
<font color="#ff8080">"What’s Wrong with Vice Chairman Lee?"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

429
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:02,752
Did you just kick it because I didn't give you the piece?

430
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:06,692
Of course not. It's a misunderstanding.

431
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:14,301
By the way, do you like this place?

432
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:17,341
It's not that I like it, but I used to come to this place...

433
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:19,541
whenever I dined out with my sisters and Dad.

434
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,311
My family was burdened with debt,

435
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:26,081
so we couldn't afford to go to a Korean beef restaurant.

436
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:27,712
I see.

437
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:31,381
What kind of person is your father?

438
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:34,091
You ask me a lot of questions unlike the other days.

439
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:36,722
He's a rocker.

440
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:38,821
What?

441
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:42,561
He's the guitarist of a band.

442
00:30:43,492 --> 00:30:45,932
I told you once that he was badly scammed...

443
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:48,532
while running an instrument store at Nagwon Arcade, right?

444
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:50,972
You told me.

445
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:54,571
You said that was why you began working at a young age.

446
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:56,641
Right.

447
00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:59,282
Ever since then, to earn money for my sisters' tuition,

448
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:02,752
he rashly tried to work at a construction site and got injured.

449
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,682
He also borrowed money from a loan shark to make a big hit...

450
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:07,952
which did become one in a different sense.

451
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:14,232
It all happened because he forced himself to do what didn't fit him.

452
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:18,702
Still, he's doing what he wants now,

453
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,202
and my sisters have achieved their dreams, so it's good.

454
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:26,541
Haven't you felt resentful towards your family?

455
00:31:27,272 --> 00:31:30,381
No. It's not like they did it on purpose.

456
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:37,651
People say that it's valuable...

457
00:31:37,722 --> 00:31:40,351
to sacrifice yourself in your life.

458
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:42,791
But it's actually not.

459
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:46,091
You just lose yourself...

460
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:48,762
by suffering and sacrificing.

461
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:53,732
In any circumstances, the most important thing is...

462
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:55,972
yourself.

463
00:31:56,972 --> 00:32:00,512
Never forget that you're most precious and the top priority...

464
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:01,912
in any moment.

465
00:32:09,412 --> 00:32:10,482
Why are you laughing?

466
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:15,151
I guess the past nine years were indeed a long time,

467
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:18,422
seeing how the comment out of your narcissism...

468
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,462
came to me as a comfort.

469
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:23,801
What do you mean, "narcissism"? That's rude.

470
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:27,732
Eat up.

471
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:33,341
Give it to me. I'll grill them.

472
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:34,611
What?

473
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:37,742
You're on a holiday, and I'm fitting myself to your style today,

474
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:39,742
so I'll try doing this too.

475
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:58,762
What do you want to do next?

476
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:00,871
I don't know.

477
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,641
They're cute.

478
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,712
You still like stuffed dolls.

479
00:33:13,212 --> 00:33:15,212
Have I told you that I like dolls?

480
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:16,611
You wrote it in the survey before...

481
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:19,551
that you wanted to receive a huge stuffed doll from someone you liked.

482
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:22,522
Oh, right. That happened.

483
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,992
Can I try this?

484
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,091
Of course.

485
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:28,432
Let's do this.

486
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:34,972
Good.

487
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:37,401
It's the first round, that's why.

488
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,172
I chose to pick you today.

489
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:46,712
That was close. My hands aren't getting warmed up easily today.

490
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:50,581
It's for certain this time.

491
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:56,492
Move, Ms. Kim.

492
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:59,861
It's frustrating just to watch you do it.

493
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:03,561
This is harder than you see. It's not easy to succeed.

494
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:06,061
I've figured out its principle as I watched.

495
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:07,502
Angle...

496
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:13,102
and timing are most important like this.

497
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:26,352
I guess knowing principles and playing actual games are different.

498
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:28,352
I couldn't focus because I had to explain.

499
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:33,292
Exact angle and precise timing.

500
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:34,292
Right now.

501
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:45,301
I'm going right away.

502
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:57,352
Please.

503
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:59,021
Gosh, please.

504
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:07,562
Just one more round.

505
00:35:10,262 --> 00:35:12,532
It's got to grab the doll.

506
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:13,602
- Yes. - Almost.

507
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:19,142
- How much is this machine? - Sir.

508
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:23,441
- Let's go now. - How much is...

509
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:29,452
Let's withdraw some cash and try...

510
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:31,381
No, that's enough.

511
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,562
You're coming to work tomorrow, right?

512
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:44,901
Of course.

513
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:48,631
I'll return to fitting myself to your life again.

514
00:35:58,012 --> 00:35:59,211
I'll see you tomorrow then.

515
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:00,682
Goodbye.

516
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:54,702
Hardworking Cow, guard home safely today as well.

517
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:06,242
How have you been, Byung Heon?

518
00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:09,151
Hello, Mi So. I've been lively,

519
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:10,751
bright, and well.

520
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:13,622
I was out in the field yesterday, so I'm calling you late now.

521
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,992
I'm sorry, and about the child abduction case in 1994...

522
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:18,961
- which you mentioned last time. - I'm listening.

523
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:21,762
It doesn't seem like what you're looking for,

524
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:24,602
but the son of Yumyung Group's chairman...

525
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:26,762
was abducted for four days in 1994.

526
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:29,932
It happened in the redevelopment district which is now Yumyung Land.

527
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:31,941
In the redevelopment district?

528
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:35,211
Yes, the company blocked all reporters from covering the case,

529
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:38,242
so there's no data except that he was in fourth grade at that time.

530
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:40,242
I searched...

531
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:43,952
and found out that the eldest son was in fourth grade then.

532
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:48,352
Things weren't so pleasant when I was in fourth grade.

533
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:51,262
I'm sorry, but nine years old...

534
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:53,292
- means you were in 2nd grade. - I was in 4th grade.

535
00:37:53,392 --> 00:37:56,731
I was so smart that I skipped two grades.

536
00:37:57,731 --> 00:37:59,301
I was in the same class with my brother.

537
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,202
No, the vice chairman was in fourth grade too.

538
00:38:22,122 --> 00:38:23,222
Ms. Kim.

539
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:27,191
What are you thinking?

540
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,892
- Hello. - Get in already.

541
00:38:40,872 --> 00:38:42,372
All right, let's go.

542
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:44,841
Well, Mr. Park.

543
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,767
What? A kidnapping?

544
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:50,666
Yes.

545
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:54,307
Have you heard anything about it from Mr. Lee?

546
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,376
Young Joon and I have been friends for a long time,

547
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:01,976
but he's never mentioned anything like that to me.

548
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,276
He also rarely talks about his childhood.

549
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,887
So you don't know anything about it, then.

550
00:39:09,287 --> 00:39:10,287
Right.

551
00:39:11,456 --> 00:39:13,927
But can I ask you what prompted you...

552
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:16,427
to look into this case?

553
00:39:18,057 --> 00:39:19,856
I don't recall exactly,

554
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,197
but I think...

555
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:26,967
I was locked up inside an empty house for a day.

556
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,367
What?

557
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:34,206
There was a boy beside me in that house,

558
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,847
and I think it was Mr. Lee.

559
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:45,017
Well, you said both Young Joon and his brother were in fourth grade.

560
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:48,987
Did that boy tell you his name by any chance?

561
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:52,997
He did, but I don't remember.

562
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:55,867
Why do you think that it could've been Young Joon?

563
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,267
Ms. Kim.

564
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:04,907
Yes, sir.

565
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,677
You said you're afraid of spiders and absolutely hate them.

566
00:40:09,347 --> 00:40:11,517
I feel the same way about cable ties.

567
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,947
So please don't use them in my office.

568
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:18,157
Please, okay?

569
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,117
- It's not okay. Let me see. - No...

570
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:24,597
It's just...

571
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,597
my hunch.

572
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:34,666
Why don't you just ask him directly?

573
00:40:36,106 --> 00:40:37,706
I thought about that, of course.

574
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:39,237
But...

575
00:40:41,347 --> 00:40:43,847
he probably hasn't mentioned anything about it...

576
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:45,776
for a reason.

577
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:48,987
It's nothing exciting, you know.

578
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:51,856
He could've been scarred by it,

579
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:54,157
so I can't ask him.

580
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:01,197
I'll just be happy about finding my childhood friend.

581
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:06,737
And...

582
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:10,476
please pretend that you didn't hear any of this, sir.

583
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:14,307
Gosh, don't you worry.

584
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:16,006
Like you said,

585
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:18,916
there must be a reason why he's never talked about it...

586
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:21,146
for the past nine years.

587
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:29,427
Ms. Kim.

588
00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:31,427
Did you have a good day off yesterday?

589
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:32,697
Yes, I did.

590
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:38,367
(Vice Chairman Lee Young Joon)

591
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:42,166
Mr. Lee got here early today.

592
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,137
He said he has a lot to do as he was off yesterday.

593
00:42:10,537 --> 00:42:11,796
Why is she staring at me like that?

594
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:14,706
She'll wear out my handsome face.

595
00:42:16,106 --> 00:42:18,506
Right, I wouldn't even have a face now if people's gazes...

596
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:19,836
could wear it out.

597
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:49,807
Did you need me, sir?

598
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:52,976
Yes, Ms. Kim. I have too many books in my study,

599
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:54,876
so I'd like to get rid of what I don't read.

600
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:56,976
- Would you be able to help me? - Of course, sir.

601
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:00,916
- When works for you? - Anytime.

602
00:43:04,686 --> 00:43:06,856
- Then how about tonight? - That sounds good.

603
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:12,796
Why are you so cooperative all of a sudden?

604
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:16,796
You gave me the strength I needed,

605
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:18,796
so I'd like to help you in any way I can.

606
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:21,836
What?

607
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:24,677
Sir.

608
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:29,247
Is there something you want to tell me?

609
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:33,887
I'm so happy that we met again like this.

610
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:38,916
Me too.

611
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:43,756
I'll be off, then.

612
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:10,316
We saw each other last night,

613
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,387
and she's that happy about seeing me again today?

614
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,026
Is she head over heels for me now?

615
00:44:35,177 --> 00:44:36,206
Seriously?

616
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:40,146
- That's crazy. - What's going on?

617
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:41,847
Why are they laughing?

618
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:44,256
Gosh, I hate it so much.

619
00:44:44,256 --> 00:44:46,157
- I want to barf. - Are they talking about me?

620
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,697
You'll find it hard to believe, but there's only one.

621
00:44:51,997 --> 00:44:53,057
- Ms. Kim. - My gosh.

622
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:56,967
- Could you spare me a moment? - Sorry?

623
00:44:57,467 --> 00:44:58,566
Why... What's the matter?

624
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:03,976
Those two...

625
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:12,017
You were talking about me, right?

626
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:14,617
Sorry? No, I wasn't.

627
00:45:14,617 --> 00:45:16,916
Don't lie to my face. I totally heard it.

628
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:18,557
"You'll find it hard to believe",

629
00:45:18,557 --> 00:45:20,856
"but there's only one." Those were your words.

630
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:22,657
You must've been telling them I only have one suit.

631
00:45:22,657 --> 00:45:23,956
No, not at all.

632
00:45:24,226 --> 00:45:25,856
Our intern was telling us...

633
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,666
how good the food at our cafeteria is,

634
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:30,226
so I was just telling him...

635
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:32,737
that it's the only cafeteria in the country that has a chef...

636
00:45:32,737 --> 00:45:34,867
who used to work at a hotel restaurant.

637
00:45:35,037 --> 00:45:36,066
Then...

638
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:38,776
why did you look at me and laugh earlier?

639
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,376
I have a naturally smiley face. Look.

640
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,686
Anyway, you'd better be careful.

641
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:51,856
I'll be watching you.

642
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,557
- What... - What's going on?

643
00:45:56,657 --> 00:45:58,057
What did you two talk about?

644
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,396
- Nothing important. - You'd better tell me.

645
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:05,666
Ji Ah, are you...

646
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:07,807
flirting with Mr. Ko?

647
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,577
Flirting, my foot. He makes my blood boil.

648
00:46:11,206 --> 00:46:13,506
What are you talking about? My blood is boiling.

649
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:17,046
My goodness.

650
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:21,987
- Gosh. - What's he doing?

651
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,126
Are you heading out for the lunch meeting?

652
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:32,557
The car is ready, sir.

653
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,327
It's not about work,

654
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:36,296
so you don't have to come. Just enjoy your lunch.

655
00:46:36,867 --> 00:46:37,896
Yes, sir.

656
00:46:38,497 --> 00:46:39,537
Just a moment, please.

657
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:47,677
I just wanted to fix your tie, sir.

658
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:58,816
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you sooner.

659
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:02,427
What?

660
00:47:06,497 --> 00:47:07,597
I was talking about your tie.

661
00:47:17,106 --> 00:47:19,476
What's wrong with Ms. Kim?

662
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:21,506
She's definitely acting weird today.

663
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:23,577
It seems like her feelings for me...

664
00:47:24,476 --> 00:47:26,146
have deepened about three times.

665
00:47:27,086 --> 00:47:29,947
Was she moved last night because I was so good to her?

666
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:46,867
We'll get it this time.

667
00:47:50,706 --> 00:47:52,706
I'd be in big trouble now if I won a toy for her last night.

668
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:55,677
Had that happened, her feelings for me would've deepened tenfold.

669
00:48:14,497 --> 00:48:15,666
I got it. Oh, no.

670
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:18,597
I got it. I did it.

671
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:23,267
Please...

672
00:48:27,546 --> 00:48:29,206
My gosh, he's so bad at it.

673
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,816
- What did you just say? - You're horrible at it.

674
00:48:33,816 --> 00:48:35,646
Move over now. Mr. Jobless.

675
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,787
What? "Jobless"?

676
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:41,626
Yes. My mom said that those who don't go to work are jobless.

677
00:48:43,126 --> 00:48:45,296
You kids are saying that because you don't know who I am.

678
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:47,367
I bet at least 1 or 2 of your home appliances...

679
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,896
and your toys...

680
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:52,037
were made by my company.

681
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:53,767
In simple terms,

682
00:48:54,037 --> 00:48:55,307
I'm rich.

683
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,976
Why are you playing the claw machine to win a toy if you're rich?

684
00:48:58,037 --> 00:49:00,347
Exactly. Can't you afford to buy 100 of it?

685
00:49:00,947 --> 00:49:03,677
Wrong. Then it wouldn't be a fair play.

686
00:49:03,677 --> 00:49:06,646
A toy like this is only valuable when you win it.

687
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:07,987
Kids.

688
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:10,956
I need to focus.

689
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:23,566
All right, here I go.

690
00:49:27,936 --> 00:49:29,166
My gosh, it's coming up.

691
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:57,537
Ms. Kim.

692
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:01,637
- There's a guest for you. - Pardon me?

693
00:50:02,006 --> 00:50:05,006
I wanted to thank you for helping me enjoy my day off.

694
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:08,247
His name is Remember Me.

695
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:10,646
Oh, this is...

696
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,697
I'm sorry I didn't remember you.

697
00:50:34,006 --> 00:50:36,037
I get that you're moved,

698
00:50:36,037 --> 00:50:39,077
but it's just a stuffed toy. Why are you tearing up?

699
00:50:41,976 --> 00:50:43,146
Ms. Kim.

700
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:50,017
We're stepping out to pick up coffee. Would you like one too?

701
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:53,017
Oh, I'd like one too.

702
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:54,927
Actually, I'll go pick them up.

703
00:50:55,157 --> 00:50:56,686
I'll be right back, sir.

704
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:09,737
Her eyes filled with tears. Was she that moved by it?

705
00:51:21,987 --> 00:51:24,557
3 lattes and 3 Americanos, please.

706
00:51:24,856 --> 00:51:25,956
Sure.

707
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:40,467
Hey, I want to go home.

708
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:43,037
Stop crying, Mi So.

709
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:45,407
I'll give you something delicious if you stop crying.

710
00:51:45,637 --> 00:51:47,077
Something delicious?

711
00:51:47,807 --> 00:51:49,747
Here, it's caramel candy.

712
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:51,876
Eat this, and don't cry.

713
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:53,847
Promise?

714
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:57,657
Enjoy.

715
00:52:24,117 --> 00:52:26,916
Oh, Ms. Kim. I feel bad. I should've gone.

716
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:30,787
You bought caramels too?

717
00:52:31,987 --> 00:52:33,517
I want to give them to someone.

718
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:35,356
Who? The guy you're seeing?

719
00:52:35,956 --> 00:52:37,626
You keep saying that.

720
00:52:38,557 --> 00:52:41,367
It's just someone I want to thank.

721
00:52:42,566 --> 00:52:45,396
He won't remember me, but still...

722
00:52:48,307 --> 00:52:49,467
By the way, have you heard?

723
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:52,436
I got a text from my friend who used to be in Morpheus' fan club.

724
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:56,407
Apparently, Morpheus was kidnapped as a kid.

725
00:52:57,677 --> 00:52:58,776
What?

726
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:02,217
It's in a blog post, which he wrote before he became famous.

727
00:53:02,487 --> 00:53:06,217
He deleted the post right away, but some fans kept the screenshot.

728
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:10,626
No way.

729
00:53:13,097 --> 00:53:15,796
Can I see the post?

730
00:53:17,037 --> 00:53:22,166
("Story from Long Ago" by Morpheus)

731
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:25,276
"In the allies of the empty redevelopment area,"

732
00:53:25,677 --> 00:53:27,947
"I could always catch a whiff of cement."

733
00:53:30,146 --> 00:53:32,146
"The black steel gate always made a screeching noise..."

734
00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,546
"when it was being opened."

735
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:35,287
(Keep Out)

736
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:37,916
"It was impossible..."

737
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,756
"to peek through the frosted honeycomb-patterned windows."

738
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:46,427
"I prayed while looking at the ropes hanging across the living room."

739
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:51,436
"If I could cross them and escape this living room..."

740
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:55,967
"Just like the abandoned stuffed bunny there,"

741
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,376
"I was abandoned, and I gradually lost my liveliness."

742
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:08,447
- Hey. - You're dumb, aren't you?

743
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:09,686
No, I'm not dumb.

744
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:11,717
I'm only five,

745
00:54:11,717 --> 00:54:14,226
but I can read books better than my older sister, Mal Hee, does.

746
00:54:14,226 --> 00:54:16,657
I'll visit soon to see you.

747
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:20,026
Really? You'll really visit me, right?

748
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:23,197
- Yes. - I'll never forget your name.

749
00:54:23,396 --> 00:54:25,467
Your name is... Lee...

750
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:28,407
- Lee... - You fool. You forgot again.

751
00:54:28,967 --> 00:54:30,606
I'll tell you my name again.

752
00:54:30,876 --> 00:54:32,637
I'm Lee Sung...

753
00:54:34,177 --> 00:54:35,307
That's right.

754
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:38,117
Lee Sung...

755
00:54:40,816 --> 00:54:42,146
His name was Lee Sung Yeon.

756
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:47,751
That's right.

757
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:50,420
Lee Sung...

758
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,630
His name was Lee Sung Yeon.

759
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:24,491
Yes, it was my brother.

760
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,431
Sung Yeon was the one who was kidnapped.

761
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,741
Then can I ask you something, sir?

762
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,150
How did you get the scar on your ankle?

763
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:51,880
Why are you asking about that suddenly?

764
00:55:53,991 --> 00:55:57,491
It seemed like you had bad memories you wanted to forget...

765
00:55:57,491 --> 00:55:59,521
and also because of the scar on your ankle,

766
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:02,230
- I assumed that it was you... - That scar...

767
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,570
I somehow ended up with it as a kid.

768
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:14,971
Was that why?

769
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,081
Pardon?

770
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,581
Did you stare at me like that all day long because you thought...

771
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,880
that I was the boy you've been looking for all these years?

772
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,331
I'm sorry I was mistaken.

773
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,931
Have you been well?

774
00:57:09,931 --> 00:57:12,030
I came to sign a contract, and I thought I'd stop by.

775
00:57:14,271 --> 00:57:16,940
I came by yesterday too, but you weren't here.

776
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,670
It was my day off.

777
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,170
I see.

778
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,541
I thought about calling you,

779
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,480
but I thought it would be better to talk to you in person.

780
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:27,650
That's why I came here.

781
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:30,380
I wanted to apologize about not telling you...

782
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,150
that Young Joon and I are brothers.

783
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:42,630
Mi So, what's wrong?

784
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:44,900
Is something wrong?

785
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,210
So you are saying...

786
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:59,440
we were locked in there together. Right?

787
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,550
Do you have absolutely no recollection of...

788
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:07,090
being there with me?

789
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:11,791
Actually, because of the shock of being kidnapped,

790
00:58:12,621 --> 00:58:14,630
my memory got fragmented.

791
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,871
How much do you remember then?

792
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,210
Do you want me to tell you what I know?

793
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:30,641
Yes.

794
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:33,141
He and I...

795
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:36,581
have been in bad terms ever since we were young.

796
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,521
What?

797
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,891
Young Joon, I mean.

798
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:45,721
Just like now, he was very boastful.

799
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:49,291
He was better than me at everything,

800
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:52,460
and we were always compared.

801
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:56,170
Then when I was in my fourth grade,

802
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,971
Young Joon skipped two grades and we ended up in the same class.

803
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:02,411
That clever boy...

804
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,840
quickly won over my friends.

805
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:09,311
Later on, he sided with them and bullied me.

806
00:59:10,351 --> 00:59:12,480
He laughed at me for being weaker than him.

807
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,150
What?

808
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,061
I fought a lot with my brother's friends.

809
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:23,701
They said I was rude and picked fights with me.

810
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,601
But I guess you were fine because you were with your brother.

811
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:28,971
No.

812
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:31,170
He was worse.

813
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,811
He's the worst sort of man.

814
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:41,751
One day, Young Joon took me to a redevelopment area.

815
00:59:42,851 --> 00:59:46,150
He said he would go buy drinks and told me to stay there.

816
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,320
Young Joon didn't come back.

817
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,260
And while I was waiting for him,

818
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,491
I got kidnapped.

819
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:19,851
Mr. Lee.

820
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:23,291
I am so happy to see you again.

821
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,760
I am sorry for recognizing you too late.

822
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,471
Mr. Lee, I am here.

823
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:46,641
Go to the study first.

824
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:50,070
Okay. I will start sorting out the ones that will be published...

825
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,581
as revised editions.

826
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,590

(Resume)

828
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:45,230
Why did I look like a country bumpkin?

829
01:02:49,271 --> 01:02:51,271
Why did I write these?

830
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,811
Did you want to brag that your college examination grades...

831
01:02:56,811 --> 01:02:58,141
were in the top one percent?

832
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:02,311
This is so embarrassing.

833
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,721
(Resume)

834
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:08,251

(Certified Professional Secretary)

839
01:03:32,411 --> 01:03:35,110
Why did he choose me instead of these people?

840
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,650
Do you want to know...

841
01:03:40,391 --> 01:03:41,420
why I hired you that time?

842
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,590
What?

843
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,530
Yes.

844
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,451
Because you are Mi So.

845
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,260
Because you are Kim Mi So.

01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,811

Who am I?

849
01:05:17,221 --> 01:05:18,951
What are you doing?

850
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:23,190
Crush?

851
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:26,021
You are interested in each other, but you're not yet dating.

852
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,530
Instead of trying to get her memory back,

853
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:30,061
she should build memories with me.

854
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,260
The reason why I came here is because...

855
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,130
Cooperation and unity.

856
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,670
No, I've come to turn our feelings...

857
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,400
- into a relationship. - What?
