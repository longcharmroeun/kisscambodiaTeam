1
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,376
Why am I so happy right now?

2
00:00:16,677 --> 00:00:19,247
Actually, this was what I have been dreaming of.

3
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,617
Cooking with my husband after work...

4
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:24,027
and spending the evening together.

5
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,697
Why is the house so hot?

6
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,877
I will make your dream come true.

7
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:45,777
We will always come home together,

8
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:47,917
and we will always eat ramen together.

9
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,317
It's fine even if my body gets filled with MSG.

10
00:00:58,286 --> 00:00:59,286
I...

11
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:02,527
I want to be your husband.

12
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:07,467
I want to marry you, Kim Mi So.

13
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,636
Why? Do you have any objections?

14
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,517
I object!

15
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:26,547
Dad!

16
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:29,616
Father!

17
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:31,756
When you two get married,

18
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:34,927
I will raise the objections at the wedding!

19
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:45,437
Why are you here, Dad? Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

20
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:46,767
The doctor said I could go.

21
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:50,107
And there's no water at home.

22
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,476
That's why I came here.

23
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:54,177
Then you should've called me first.

24
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:57,217
I sent you a text message. You didn't reply.

25
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,886
There was an emergency at the office, so I wasn't myself.

26
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:04,487
I need to talk to you.

27
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:07,157
Dad, talk here.

28
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:09,096
I have to talk to him man-to-man.

29
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:10,827
Stay out of it.

30
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:14,697
Let's go.

31
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:43,156
(Episode 15)

32
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:06,387
You disappointed me very much today.

33
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,427
You are a couple,

34
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,927
so I guess you could come over to her place.

35
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:17,227
When I was dating Mi So's mom,

36
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:20,737
I used to go to her place whenever her mother was away.

37
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,607
Anyway, how could you propose to her by saying that you want to...

38
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:33,276
eat ramen until your body gets filed with MSG? It's unromantic.

39
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,716
I am sorry.

40
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:38,047
I just meant we should live a simple...

41
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,616
and a happy life together.

42
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:40,757
Do you...

43
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,857
really mean to marry my Mi So?

44
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:47,526
Yes. I want to marry her.

45
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:50,526
Then propose to her again.

46
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,026
Excuse me?

47
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:53,966
The times have changed,

48
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:56,436
but romance still lives.

49
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,336
I can't give my daughter to...

50
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,537
an uncool, insincere man like you.

51
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:07,246
Why? Are you not confident?

52
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,376
No, I am confident.

53
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:11,547
Actually, I am overflowing with confidence.

54
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:15,517
I like your spirit.

55
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:19,826
Drink.

56
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,366
Bottoms-up.

57
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:26,766
Bottoms-up.

58
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:34,576
You better propose to my daughter...

59
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,706
in the most romantic way.

60
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:41,946
I will watch you...

61
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,316
with these charismatic eyes.

62
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,487
Okay.

63
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:51,157
Please don't look away. Watch me.

64
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,456
Okay.

65
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,967
- Bottoms-up. - Bottoms-up.

66
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,706
Let's drink until we die.

67
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,746
- Bottoms-up. - Bottoms-up.

68
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,417
- That's it. Bottoms-up. - Bottoms-up.

69
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,917
Okay. Bottoms-up.

70
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:29,196
All right. One more.

71
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,597
The person you have reached is not available.

72
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,737
What are they talking about? Why isn't he picking up the phone?

73
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:46,006
He's not getting yelled at, is he?

74
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,727
Father,

75
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:02,727
thank you for bringing Mi So into this world.

76
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:07,566
You have to treat my Mi So well.

77
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,496
Buy her a lot of good food.

78
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:13,037
And do you know...

79
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,777
that Mi So loves mackerel?

80
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:17,177
Mi So doesn't eat mackerel now.

81
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,907
Two years ago,

82
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:21,277
a fish bone got stuck in her throat while eating mackerel.

83
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:24,047
Ever since then, she's too scared to eat mackerel.

84
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,917
- Is that right? - Yes.

85
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:29,556
Then buy her a lot of chicken feet then.

86
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:32,487
Especially on the day she's really stressed out.

87
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:34,956
When she's stressed,

88
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,056
she needs to eat something really spicy.

89
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,996
Mi So doesn't eat spicy food anymore even if she's stressed.

90
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,737
When she found out about your private loan,

91
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:45,607
she was so stressed out that she ate spicy chicken feet,

92
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:50,076
spicy tteokbokki, and spicy eel in rotation.

93
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:52,977
And it gave her a really bad stomachache.

94
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,076
- Is that right? - Yes.

95
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:58,386
By the way, how did you...

96
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:00,016
know about...

97
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,116
my private loan?

98
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:05,157
I also know that your business in Nagwon Arcade bankrupted...

99
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:08,456
and that you got screwed over for standing surety for a friend.

100
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:10,496
- Do you really? - Yes.

101
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,837
How humiliating.

102
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:17,337
My family is...

103
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:20,237
even poorer...

104
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,607
than you have imagined.

105
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:29,477
It must be shocking to hear, but the house Mi So lives in...

106
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,217
is not her own house. She pays an annual rent.

107
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,917
It's not annual, it's actually monthly.

108
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:38,157
The deposit was 50,000 dollars, with a monthly rent of 200 dollars.

109
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,056
- Really? - Yes.

110
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,696
I am getting to know a lot about my daughter.

111
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,737
She's got nothing.

112
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:53,266
Do you still like Mi So?

113
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,537
Yes.

114
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:57,477
Are you confident that your feelings won't change?

115
00:07:58,047 --> 00:07:59,147
Yes.

116
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,487
We lead the change in the world.

117
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,917
But my feelings for Mi So will not change.

118
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,987
- You pass. - What? Pass what?

119
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:16,397
I appoint you...

120
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,366
as my son-in-law.

121
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,566
- Thank you. - But...

122
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:27,006
you have to...

123
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:30,076
propose to her properly.

124
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:32,347
I will remember that.

125
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,047
My goodness.

126
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,647
I like you so much.

127
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:40,887
Have a seat. Have a seat.

128
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,157
Hey.

129
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:46,157
Sit properly.

130
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,767
I love you.

131
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,566
I love you, My Son.

132
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,476
I love you too.

133
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:05,806
Treat Mi So well.

134
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,346
What I want is not a rich son-in-law.

135
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:13,986
I want a man who can make Mi So happy.

136
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,586
Of course being rich is good too.

137
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:20,387
Yes. You are right about everything, Father.

138
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:25,897
My darling Mi So.

139
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:28,497
My woman.

140
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,076
What's going on? Why did you drink so much?

141
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,907
Why else? It's because we wanted to, of course.

142
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,877
You drive me crazy.

143
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:44,617
You only got discharged a few days ago, so how could you drink so much?

144
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,216
You'll be 60 soon.

145
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:47,617
You have to take care of your health!

146
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,387
Kim Mi So!

147
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:53,127
That's no way to speak to Father-in-Law.

148
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,157
Same goes for you, Mr. Lee. You have a board meeting tomorrow,

149
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:57,667
so you shouldn't have had this much to drink.

150
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,127
You should be looking over the agenda for tomorrow.

151
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:05,907
This is a secret.

152
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,677
Mi So scares me sometimes.

153
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,476
This is also a secret...

154
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,047
but Mi So...

155
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,787
scares me often.

156
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:24,226
Gosh.

157
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:36,397
I'm going to head inside and sleep.

158
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:38,407
So, go ahead...

159
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,736
and get a cab for my son-in-law here, and come inside.

160
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,677
What do you mean, "son-in-law"?

161
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:49,877
Get home safely, sir.

162
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:53,186
Okay, my son-in-law!

163
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,657
Bye-bye.

164
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,257
- Get home safely, sir. - Bye-bye.

165
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:00,287
Why are you also being like this, Mr. Lee?

166
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:10,236
Mr. Lee.

167
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:13,806
Gosh!

168
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:15,836
My woman.

169
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,617
This is driving me crazy.

170
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:24,846
Come on, now.

171
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:29,157
Hello, Mr. Yang.

172
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:32,127
Yes, the four-way intersection in Jangchung-dong.

173
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:34,997
Please hurry. All right.

174
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,336
Are you all right, Mr. Lee?

175
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,007
So why did you drink this much, when you have such a low tolerance?

176
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:51,946
Be sure to drink less next time.

177
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:55,846
Mi So.

178
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:10,897
Mi So.

179
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,167
I love you.

180
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:34,017
I...

181
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:39,226
really love you a whole lot.

182
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:45,897
To be honest,

183
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:52,367
when I saw you again nine years ago,

184
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,476
I was so happy.

185
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,147
You didn't recognize me,

186
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,056
but I was so happy,

187
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:14,127
I think...

188
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,427
it may have been since then.

189
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,336
I think I've loved you...

190
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:26,236
since then.

191
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:49,427
I...

192
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,726
will make you happy for the rest of your life.

193
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,606
And I...

194
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:02,936
will be happy for the rest of my life because of you.

195
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:14,686
I love you,

196
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:18,427
Kim Mi So.

197
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:28,897
What happened?

198
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:31,497
How did I get home?

199
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:39,167
I hope I didn't embarrass myself in front of Father-in-Law.

200
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:44,346
Come on, my perfect brain. Remember.

201
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:47,247
Come on, help me...

202
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,147
Trying to use my brain is only making my head hurt more.

203
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:05,696
I feel like I'm going to vomit.

204
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,297
Hang in there no matter what, my stomach.

205
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,907
If you ruin the refined image I've cultivated for the past 33 years,

206
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:14,907
I won't forgive you!

207
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:20,377
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Lee?

208
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,617
No, I wasn't talking to you, Mr. Yang.

209
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,387
I was talking to my stomach.

210
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:29,356
Pardon? To... To your stomach?

211
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:31,086
Yes.

212
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,537
Good morning, everyone.

213
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:56,117
What's going on?

214
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,517
We have something to give you, Ms. Kim.

215
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:02,086
We got a plaque as a way of thanking you.

216
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:03,787
A plaque?

217
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:12,796
To our beloved Ms. Kim

218
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:17,807
whom we've been with for a long time

219
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:23,706
Why must we say farewell?

220
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:29,016
Why must you go?

221
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,617
A plaque to show our appreciation,

222
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:37,427
for Kim Mi So.

223
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,696
You may be leaving us,

224
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:45,867
but the passion, vision, and leadership that you've shown us...

225
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:48,367
will remain with us forever.

226
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,167
Thank you for your hard work for the past nine years.

227
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,637
From your coworkers at the Vice Chairman's Office.

228
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:01,347
The thing is...

229
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,546
The thing is...

230
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,387
I'm not quitting.

231
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:14,256
Yes, I'm sure you're not quitting.

232
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,327
Wait, what?

233
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:21,337
Yes, it's true.

234
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:24,907
I realized that I like this job a lot more than I thought.

235
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:28,506
So I changed my mind and decided to continue working hard.

236
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:33,746
Really?

237
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,877
You're really not leaving us, right?

238
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,317
That's great! I was so worried about...

239
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,956
who would take care of Mr. Lee if you were to leave.

240
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,557
This is great.

241
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:44,756
I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you.

242
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,927
You went through all this trouble for me, though.

243
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:51,196
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,867
If you really are sorry, don't ever say that you'll quit again.

245
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,296
Promise me.

246
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,036
- Promise me! - Promise me!

247
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,167
Promise me too.

248
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,077
You can keep this.

249
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,016
I'm so relieved. I was so worried.

250
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:12,246
Goodness.

251
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:17,827
Wait a second.

252
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,796
What's going to happen to me now, then?

253
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,526
What do you mean?

254
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,696
I was hired as your replacement,

255
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:29,067
but if you decide not to resign,

256
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:31,907
will I get fired?

257
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:39,347
No way.

258
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:41,917
I got more of my time because I could share the workload with you.

259
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,887
That's a huge part of the reason why I've decided to stay.

260
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,286
I hope we continue to get along.

261
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,726
Okay, I'll work harder.

262
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:55,927
Here's the development team meeting log.

263
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,026
Thank you.

264
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:00,496
I have to say, you're someone who has everything, Ms. Kim.

265
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:02,796
You're competent, have a cool boyfriend,

266
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,766
and have a loyal colleague.

267
00:20:07,236 --> 00:20:09,177
Don't say that.

268
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:12,276
I mean, you argued with those women...

269
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:13,506
who badmouthed Ms. Kim in the restroom.

270
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:16,946
You held a mop and stepped forward first there.

271
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:23,216
Well, if you two have time this evening,

272
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,127
how about we have dinner together?

273
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:26,887
Why all of a sudden?

274
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,597
Listening to you makes me grateful that I want to treat you to a meal.

275
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:33,167
- I'm free. - I have plenty of time.

276
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,436
Treat us to delicious food.

277
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:37,067
Let's have some real get-together today then.

278
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:40,067
- Perfect. - Sure.

279
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,536
What should we have?

280
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:43,137
- Fried chicken and beer? - Oh, gosh.

281
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:45,577
Hello.

282
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:51,887
Gosh.

283
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:18,807
Have some pollack soup.

284
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:23,617
I made some for you too as I was making the soup for my dad.

285
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,557
Thank you.

286
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:30,857
How's your father?

287
00:21:32,986 --> 00:21:35,956
He's suffering from his hangover like you.

288
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:40,226
He went back to his house to take care of his business.

289
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,167
I see.

290
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:02,387
You see,

291
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,927
I sometimes felt uncomfortable being too perfect.

292
00:22:08,456 --> 00:22:11,966
I was worried my flawless image might intimidate others.

293
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:15,996
I think it's okay to make mistakes from time to time...

294
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:18,107
because I'm human too.

295
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,377
If you're saying this because of your drunken behavior last night...

296
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:23,776
My drunken... Gosh.

297
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:27,147
Listen.

298
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,387
That behavior was minutely calculated to show my flaw.

299
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,587
Still, you should've refrained yourself.

300
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,186
How could you drink that recklessly...

301
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:38,986
without thinking about the next day?

302
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:40,857
You're the owner of a company.

303
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:44,067
Aside from being the owner of a company,

304
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,327
I'm the future husband of a woman.

305
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,796
So it was right for me to listen to your father.

306
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,506
Still, you should've drunk only to a certain degree.

307
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:57,246
What did you two talk about by the way?

308
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,647
It took you guys a while to return home.

309
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:06,617
It's a secret.

310
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:10,657
What?

311
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:14,857
What, propose?

312
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:16,956
There's nothing to hesitate.

313
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:20,897
Like your future father-in-law said, do a romantic proposal.

314
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:22,796
You have money because you're rich.

315
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:25,936
Rent an entire restaurant and open the best quality champagne.

316
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:27,807
- I already did. - What?

317
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:32,607
It's the limited champagne which you mentioned.

318
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:34,776
Bring it with the cake a little while later.

319
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:38,516
Champagne is the best to celebrate something.

320
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:41,387
I even failed the attempt because of the circumstances.

321
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:47,796
How about you rent the entire Yumyung Land?

322
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:50,196
All rich guys who own an amusement park do that in dramas.

323
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,827
- I already did that. - Oh, right.

324
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:53,966
I forgot.

325
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:03,107
It's closed already.

326
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,107
That doesn't matter.

327
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:08,117
I'm the free pass.

328
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:13,347
You've done a lot of large-scaled and fancy events,

329
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:16,657
so how about you do something trivial and cute this time?

330
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:21,026
Throw the proposal in a daily mood.

331
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:25,526
I, Lee Young Joon, will marry you.

332
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:29,196
I'm smart, handsome, rich, and competent.

333
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:30,907
So...

334
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:33,436
stop resisting and marry me.

335
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,936
Ms. Kim, like I told you before,

336
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:38,147
I'm smart, handsome,

337
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,006
rich, and competent.

338
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:43,046
So marry me...

339
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,117
as soon as possible.

340
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:48,657
I want to be your husband.

341
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:54,397
I see, you did that too.

342
00:24:58,726 --> 00:24:59,966
I mean,

343
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:02,766
since you two still aren't married after all those attempts of yours,

344
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,006
maybe Ms. Kim...

345
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:07,506
has no intention of marrying you. Well, that won't be the case.

346
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,637
Never.

347
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:14,417
By the way, you're amazing at pushing things ahead.

348
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,216
Ms. Kim called you bulldozer for a reason after all.

349
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:19,946
Sexy and cheeky bulldozer.

350
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:23,486
Wedding Bulldozer, should I say?

351
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:26,327
Stop it before I bulldoze you out.

352
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:29,357
Sorry, that was thoughtless of me.

353
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:30,667
Sorry, Wedding Bulldozer.

354
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:37,407
Thoughtless Park, how did you propose to your ex-wife?

355
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:40,807
I...

356
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:45,446
I wasn't so thoughtless when I did my proposal.

357
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,847
I did a romantic proposal under Eiffel Tower in Paris.

358
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:53,046
Is that romantic?

359
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:56,557
Proposing under the iron lattice tower?

360
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,956
You cheeky Wedding Bulldozer.

361
00:26:01,657 --> 00:26:05,397
There's this romantic mood which comes from the city, Paris.

362
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,696
The city makes you want to fall in love.

363
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:13,667
Under the sparkling Eiffel Tower,

364
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,476
while she was immersed in the mood...

365
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:18,877
"Seo Jin,"

366
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:22,177
"you sparkle more than this Eiffel Tower."

367
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:24,587
"Can you shine by my side forever?"

368
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:29,317
"Marry me."

369
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:32,186
Then she accepted it right away.

370
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:39,526
But she ended up not shining by your side forever.

371
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:41,167
That was mean.

372
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,036
You just pierced my heart.

373
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:47,536
Anyway,

374
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:49,407
your proposal to her...

375
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:51,546
might be better at a romantic place,

376
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:54,446
than somewhere familiar. Oh, geez...

377
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:57,147
This topic is reminding me of Seo Jin.

378
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,177
Eiffel Tower...

379
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:25,476
My pride doesn't accept myself from doing the exact same thing.

380
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:29,716
Colosseum? No, it's too battle-like.

381
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:33,087
Great Wall of China is too obvious.

382
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:36,756
Las Vegas?

383
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,557
Right.

384
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,726
It's splendid and fatal just like me.

385
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:44,996
Las Vegas, it is.

386
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,936
To fully enjoy the afterglow of my splendid and fatal proposal,

387
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,006
7 days and 6 nights should be good enough.

388
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:08,657
I can't believe I'm reserving a hotel room myself.

389
00:28:14,897 --> 00:28:15,956
Good.

390
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:21,397
I'm so sweet.

391
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,476
(I love you.)

392
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,276
(I love you.)

393
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:18,087
Gosh, it's hot.

394
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:22,026
I guess I should go to the rooftop for some fresh air. It's hot.

395
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:24,526
Gosh.

396
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,867
I forgot to call my mother.

397
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:30,867
Hello?

398
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,837
They're trying so hard.

399
00:29:35,337 --> 00:29:38,807
They're struggling to hide it, so let's just act like we don't know.

400
00:29:39,546 --> 00:29:40,647
What do you mean?

401
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:43,516
Mr. Yang, and Ms. Bong are going out.

402
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:44,686
Are you serious?

403
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:46,317
Hyun Seung.

404
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:49,486
You're so slow-witted. I mean, they're making it so obvious.

405
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:53,387
The most important thing in your office life...

406
00:29:54,657 --> 00:29:55,827
is wits.

407
00:29:56,857 --> 00:30:00,026
If I had relied solely on my appearance,

408
00:30:00,026 --> 00:30:01,736
I wouldn't have reached this far.

409
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:03,097
Sure thing.

410
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:08,036
It seems like you're not that interested, Mr. Ko,

411
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:09,436
whether who's going out with whom or not.

412
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:10,706
I know.

413
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:13,006
Aren't you seeing anyone?

414
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:18,516
I'm already dating.

415
00:30:22,357 --> 00:30:23,857
With work.

416
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,256
I'm not interested in stuff other than dating with work.

417
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,280
<font color="#8080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E15 What's Wrong With Secretary Kim?</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

418
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:46,046
Here.

419
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:48,117
It's the contract from the legal team.

420
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,546
I've done checking typos and mistakes.

421
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:53,387
- Good work. - No problem.

422
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:07,597
These are contracts, and this is next week's schedule list.

423
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:08,766
Please refer to it.

424
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:12,307
Cancel all the schedules next week.

425
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:18,677
I'm planning to take you to Las Vegas next week.

426
00:31:20,377 --> 00:31:22,276
What for?

427
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:24,647
What do you mean? For vacation.

428
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:27,557
You and I alone.

429
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:34,756
Is going on a vacation alone with me that exciting...

430
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:37,867
to make you speechless? Then again, it must be.

431
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:40,427
We can enjoy the night views and go on some drives too.

432
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:41,567
We can't do that.

433
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,706
What can't we do? The night views or drive?

434
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,476
The vacation itself doesn't make sense.

435
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:52,607
You have a lot of work to do.

436
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:55,046
As far as I know, every schedule is adjustable.

437
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:58,817
Sir, ever since people found out about our relationship,

438
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,486
people are paying their attention to us.

439
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:03,686
We shouldn't make any trouble regarding work at times like this.

440
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:07,526
- Still... - I'll ignore what you said.

441
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:15,236
You don't have any special schedule after work today.

442
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,137
Can I have dinner with Ji Ah?

443
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:21,736
We might have a drink too.

444
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,577
You won't go on a vacation with me,

445
00:32:26,607 --> 00:32:29,377
but you'll have dinner and a drink with Ji Ah?

446
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:33,087
It's not something to compare with.

447
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,956
Do as you want. Have a drink or not because I don't care.

448
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:39,557
Thank you.

449
00:32:41,956 --> 00:32:43,296
"Thank you"?

450
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,137
Is this something to be grateful?

451
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,407
How should I deal with this problem?

452
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:54,936
She won't go to Las Vegas.

453
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:57,407
Then I have to plan everything about my proposal again.

454
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:05,617
Help yourself. I wanted to buy you something more delicious.

455
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:08,516
Drinks are the most delicious.

456
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:10,157
- Let's clink. - Cheers.

457
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:11,956
- Cheers. - Cheers.

458
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:20,427
It's nice.

459
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:24,637
Anyway, thank you for siding with me.

460
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:28,107
Don't even bother about what others say.

461
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:32,077
I will as long as my closest colleagues think it's okay.

462
00:33:32,776 --> 00:33:34,347
That's cool.

463
00:33:35,016 --> 00:33:38,286
I've been really curious about this,

464
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:40,617
but since when did you two start dating?

465
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:43,617
Who started the crush first?

466
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:48,456
Go on and tell us.

467
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:51,897
Maybe...

468
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,266
it's the vice chairman.

469
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,266
- Goodness. - It's the vice chairman.

470
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,736
Drink already.

471
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:08,077
Who held hands first?

472
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:11,187
"Maybe it's the vice chairman."

473
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:17,657
Then who kissed first?

474
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,526
"Maybe it's the vice chairman."

475
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:24,097
Then who...

476
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:25,196
That's enough.

477
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:26,867
Okay.

478
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:32,236
Here.

479
00:34:36,177 --> 00:34:37,747
Oh, right. Ms. Bong.

480
00:34:37,747 --> 00:34:40,276
How is it going with your superhero?

481
00:34:41,077 --> 00:34:43,316
I'm not sure if I can say this.

482
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:47,256
I'll confess first before you ask me.

483
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:48,916
I held hands...

484
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:50,927
with that man.

485
00:34:51,986 --> 00:34:53,626
I kissed him too.

486
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:56,157
It was great.

487
00:34:56,157 --> 00:34:57,497
We even...

488
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:00,097
Ms. Bong.

489
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,396
You don't have to share the details.

490
00:35:03,396 --> 00:35:04,807
Did I go too far?

491
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:09,477
What about you, Ji Ah? Do you have anyone?

492
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:15,146
I have someone I like,

493
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,046
but he's not interested in dating.

494
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,847
He wants to focus on work.

495
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:22,856
Goodness.

496
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:26,256
Still, you shouldn't sit around like this.

497
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:29,526
You should make him focus more on you than work.

498
00:35:29,526 --> 00:35:31,566
Be more aggressive.

499
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:34,836
Can I do that?

500
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:36,367
Of course.

501
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:39,867
Let's clink together first.

502
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,236
Here.

503
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:45,606
For Ms. Kim's happy romance at work,

504
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:48,747
Ji Ah's crush to come true,

505
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,787
and me and my boyfriend's thrilling sex life.

506
00:35:54,216 --> 00:35:55,557
Bottoms up.

507
00:35:59,586 --> 00:36:03,227
(Proposal ideas)

508
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,307
It's too childish.

509
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:18,046
What kind of people do this stuff?

510
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:21,677
The weather is hot as is, but they volunteer...

511
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,646
to make a fire pit.

512
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:31,727
(Dear my love)

513
00:36:31,727 --> 00:36:33,626
(Thank you for loving me.)

514
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:37,466
He could've written everything down on a large sheet of paper.

515
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,566
Why did he turn the pages one by one?

516
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:43,966
It doesn't suit someone like me...

517
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:45,836
who doesn't waste even a second.

518
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:59,086
Why am I not getting anything from Mi So by the way?

519
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,687
Did something happen to her?

520
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:07,756
- Cheers. - Cheers. Bottoms up.

521
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:12,597
It's nice.

522
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:16,466
I need to have some soup.

523
00:37:17,637 --> 00:37:20,937
Ms. Bong, you're holding the spoon upside down.

524
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,977
You must be drunk.

525
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:29,117
- She's not. - I'm holding it right.

526
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:31,347
It's not upside down. What's going on?

527
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:34,057
Maybe she's really drunk.

528
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:37,957
Let me go to the restroom for a second.

529
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:40,597
- Okay. - Don't take it long.

530
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:42,457
I'll miss you.

531
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:44,126
- Gosh. - Be careful.

532
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:49,937
Ms. Kim, the restroom is over there.

533
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:53,236
- She's drunk. - Oops.

534
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:59,207
She's drunk.

535
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,376
She went there when the restroom is this way.

536
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:03,787
She's drunk.

537
00:38:04,646 --> 00:38:06,017
It's hilarious.

538
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,916
Who is it?

539
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:11,526
(Vice Chairman)

540
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:13,327
It's the vice chairman.

541
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:16,196
- Take it. - Let's take the call.

542
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:20,427
- Hello? - Hello, Ms. Kim. What?

543
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:25,166
Isn't it Ms. Kim Mi So's phone?

544
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:27,037
That's right.

545
00:38:27,376 --> 00:38:30,946
It's her phone, and I'm Ms. Bong.

546
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:33,847
Ji Ah is here too.

547
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:37,117
Where's Ms. Kim?

548
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:39,986
Mi So went to the restroom.

549
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:44,387
When will you come to pick her up?

550
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,626
Come pick her up.

551
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:49,126
She's totally drunk.

552
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:52,026
- What... She's drunk? - She's drunk.

553
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:54,066
She's completely drunk.

554
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:57,236
Let's drink and die.

555
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:06,946
- Let's have one more shot. - Cheers.

556
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:15,187
Sir, how did you know we're here?

557
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,787
How did you come here?

558
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:22,756
Sir, here. Sit here.

559
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:24,626
Here. Sit here.

560
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:28,296
My gosh, how did he know that we'd be here?

561
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:30,437
I told you.

562
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:33,106
He loves me very much.

563
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:35,236
I envy you.

564
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:39,577
Gosh, you.

565
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:42,046
You kill me.

566
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,687
Mr. Lee, shall I pour you a glass too?

567
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,557
No, thank you. I drove here.

568
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:51,387
I'm sorry. I should've been more thoughtful.

569
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:55,427
Ji Ah, why are you acting like such a loser?

570
00:39:55,597 --> 00:40:00,427
He's not here as our vice chairman.

571
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:03,267
He's here as our co-worker,

572
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:06,537
who's also Ms. Kim's boyfriend.

573
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:07,677
Aren't I right?

574
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:13,776
Yes, you're right.

575
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:17,617
Then from this moment on, we'll treat you as her boyfriend,

576
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:18,617
Young Joon.

577
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,287
Great! If that's the case...

578
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:25,457
Young Joon.

579
00:40:26,626 --> 00:40:30,497
Young Joon, what do you like most about her?

580
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:33,597
Answer the question quickly, Young Joon.

581
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,437
Well... Because of how pretty she is?

582
00:40:40,876 --> 00:40:43,977
- He said she's pretty! My goodness. - He loves her because she's pretty.

583
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:47,747
- He said she's pretty. - She is pretty indeed.

584
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:52,816
Ms. Kim, how about we get going now?

585
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:55,787
- Sorry? - Where do you think you're going?

586
00:40:56,216 --> 00:41:00,387
We rarely get to hang out like this. You can't go anywhere.

587
00:41:00,387 --> 00:41:03,727
Well, if you really want to leave, you'll have to...

588
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:06,466
write your name with your bottom.

589
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,896
Young Joon, Young Joon.

590
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:12,066
Come again? With what?

591
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:15,876
Actually, we must make sure he absolutely can't leave.

592
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:16,876
Yes.

593
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:18,606
Ji Ah, catch this.

594
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:20,847
Nice catch!

595
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,816
I'm still worried though.

596
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,086
What's that? Let me see. I haven't seen that before. What is this?

597
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:33,557
My gosh.

598
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:38,666
Well done. Great job.

599
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:45,106
- What is this about? - Now, you can't go home!

600
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:48,037
Don't even try! I'll give this back when we all go home.

601
00:41:49,537 --> 00:41:51,977
Ms. Kim, can you try to stop these ladies?

602
00:41:53,776 --> 00:41:55,017
This situation is hilarious.

603
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:57,747
Isn't it so hilarious?

604
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:05,727
By the way, when are you two planning to get married?

605
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:08,997
Well, I'm so curious to find out how rich guys like you...

606
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,867
propose to their girlfriends.

607
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:16,396
Hey, it'll obviously be the most romantic marriage proposal ever.

608
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:18,736
He'll probably rent a private jet...

609
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,137
and throw a fabulous surprise event there...

610
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:23,776
to propose to her, or...

611
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:26,106
That's a good idea.

612
00:42:26,347 --> 00:42:28,216
Or he'll buy an island somewhere...

613
00:42:28,216 --> 00:42:31,787
so that he can propose romantically with no one else around.

614
00:42:32,747 --> 00:42:34,017
That's a good idea too.

615
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:38,126
"Renting a private jet and buying an entire island"?

616
00:42:41,997 --> 00:42:43,427
That's such a waste of money.

617
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,427
Right, I guess we went a bit too far.

618
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:47,296
- It would be a waste of money. - For real.

619
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:49,896
When he proposes to you,

620
00:42:49,896 --> 00:42:54,407
you'll have to take a photo and send it to us, okay?

621
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:55,836
All right, I will.

622
00:42:56,437 --> 00:42:59,077
- My gosh, thank you. - Well, let's drink.

623
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:00,977
Oh, you can't drink.

624
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:03,146
- Cheers. - Drink up.

625
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:04,247
Thank you!

626
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:08,887
Why are you in such a good mood?

627
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,457
Because you haven't been out like this for a long time?

628
00:43:12,526 --> 00:43:13,526
Yes.

629
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:17,896
I've never been this drunk before.

630
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:19,867
Why?

631
00:43:20,937 --> 00:43:24,137
I always had to be on standby as I didn't know when you'd call.

632
00:43:30,677 --> 00:43:33,446
Come to think of it, it's making me angry.

633
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:35,017
What do you mean?

634
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,146
You drank all the time without even offering me a single drink.

635
00:43:39,787 --> 00:43:42,256
You just made me drive you home when you were drunk.

636
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:47,227
So? Do you hate me now or what?

637
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:51,566
No, I still like you.

638
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:57,836
Thanks for coming to pick me up. I was touched.

639
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:02,376
You should be more impressed by my face.

640
00:44:04,646 --> 00:44:07,216
Yes, you're absolutely right.

641
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:11,416
You're handsome, and you're a good singer too.

642
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:15,617
I'll let you in on a secret.

643
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:19,727
The day you sang me the lullaby,

644
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:22,526
I was so moved.

645
00:44:23,396 --> 00:44:24,727
And I slept like a baby.

646
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,437
Gosh, be careful.

647
00:44:32,307 --> 00:44:34,037
My boyfriend is the best.

648
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:56,157
Gosh, my head...

649
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:06,267
What on earth happened last night?

650
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,106
Mr. Lee!

651
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:12,876
Gosh, seriously.

652
00:45:14,017 --> 00:45:15,177
You kill me.

653
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:23,517
What should I do now?

654
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:35,196
Ms. Kim.

655
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:40,937
Are you just getting in? How's your stomach?

656
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:43,376
My stomach is all right,

657
00:45:43,847 --> 00:45:46,207
but I'm worried about my future.

658
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:48,847
What should we do?

659
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:52,946
We did something crazy to Mr. Lee last night.

660
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:54,416
What do you mean?

661
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:56,256
Don't you remember?

662
00:45:56,856 --> 00:45:58,287
Last night, I...

663
00:45:59,486 --> 00:46:01,327
I took his wallet.

664
00:46:01,856 --> 00:46:04,497
And I took his watch from him.

665
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:07,836
What if I get fired when I've only been with the company for a month?

666
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,466
What should we do?

667
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,307
- What are we going to do now? - We must've been out of our minds.

668
00:46:21,247 --> 00:46:23,117
I'm... I'm sorry, sir.

669
00:46:24,887 --> 00:46:26,546
Me too. I'm very...

670
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:28,887
I'm sorry, sir.

671
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,787
- We apologize. - We're sorry.

672
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:34,626
- We're so sorry. - We're really sorry, sir.

673
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:38,696
It's all right.

674
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:41,597
It's all good if you two had a great time.

675
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:46,966
But...

676
00:46:47,907 --> 00:46:51,006
I hope I don't have to see that ever again.

677
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:54,577
- Understood. - Got it, sir.

678
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:04,957
What did he say? Was he really angry?

679
00:47:05,427 --> 00:47:07,796
No, he wasn't. But...

680
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:08,856
But what?

681
00:47:09,457 --> 00:47:12,026
- He'd like to speak with you too. - What? Me too?

682
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:53,066
Have a seat.

683
00:48:04,887 --> 00:48:06,247
What is this?

684
00:48:07,216 --> 00:48:08,356
It's dried pollack soup.

685
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:10,727
I asked Ms. Oh to make some.

686
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,719
You see,

687
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:48,790
my overly perfectionistic tendencies drive me crazy sometimes.

688
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,630
And I was worried...

689
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:55,130
that such tendencies might suffocate you.

690
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,040
Like you said,

691
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,009
making mistakes and showing your vulnerability occasionally...

692
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,239
isn't a bad thing. Aren't I right?

693
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,679
But still, try to refrain from doing such things.

694
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:18,590
Yes, sir.

695
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,259
I should because I'm your secretary.

696
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:26,560
No.

697
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,199
Because you're my girlfriend.

698
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:33,529
I'm worried that you might ruin your health.

699
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,480
Eat up.

700
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,710
I tried some yesterday. It cures a hangover like nothing else does.

701
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,750
Okay, thank you.

702
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,000
Oh, and I must say,

703
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:06,299
you're very cute when you're drunk.

704
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,869
I'll never forget how cute you were.

705
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:38,099
Is your stomach all right?

706
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:40,170
It looks like you drank a lot last night.

707
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,340
How did you know that I drank last night?

708
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,340
Do I reek of alcohol?

709
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:49,139
You don't remember at all?

710
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,279
You even recorded a video using my phone.

711
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,020
A video?

712
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:01,860
Never mind. Don't worry about it if you have no recollection of it.

713
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:05,759
How can I not worry about it? A video of what?

714
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:07,599
- Give it back. - Hold on.

715
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,830
I must watch it if I recorded it.

716
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,639
All right, Mr. Ko.

717
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,739
Are you really going to do nothing but work? What about dating?

718
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,049
Does that mean you won't even date me?

719
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:25,150
Answer my question.

720
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,080
Gosh, Ji Ah. Why are you being like this?

721
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:32,719
Just date me already.

722
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,860
Hurry up and say that you'll go out with me.

723
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,889
Come on. I need to record this moment to keep it as proof!

724
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:42,029
You're so drunk now. Ji Ah, go in. Gosh, I can smell the alcohol.

725
00:51:42,259 --> 00:51:43,659
My goodness, you reek of alcohol.

726
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,670
- Come on. - Go in already.

727
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:48,500
- We're dating now, then. - Ji Ah.

728
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:51,610
You were very drunk last night.

729
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,909
You kept cracking crazy jokes. My goodness.

730
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,679
That wasn't a joke.

731
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,590
Sorry?

732
00:52:07,889 --> 00:52:09,020
I...

733
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,759
I think I have feelings for you.

734
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:18,029
Maybe it started when you gave me five cherry tomatoes...

735
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,040
or when you helped me glue back the shredded document together.

736
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,710
It may have been the day when you called guobaorou "guodaknown"...

737
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,110
and smiled at me with your kind eyes.

738
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,349
I'm not exactly sure when it began.

739
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,980
But in any case,

740
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,889
I think I like you.

741
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,299
Can we talk later in the day?

742
00:52:58,969 --> 00:53:01,610
What's he thinking? Why does he want to talk later?

743
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,779
Had he wanted to reject me, he would've done so right away.

744
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,360
Oh, my goodness. I guess I'm getting a boyfriend too!

745
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,230
That was a nice move.

746
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:29,940
Thank you.

747
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,179
It's very good.

748
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:43,790
Ji Ah.

749
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,090
The more I get to know you, the more I think you're a wonderful person.

750
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,290
You never reveal other people's secrets,

751
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:54,730
and you've helped me out a lot as well.

752
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:00,969
But the thing is,

753
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,069
I can't...

754
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:07,639
reciprocate your feelings.

755
00:54:10,909 --> 00:54:12,009
Sorry?

756
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:15,319
Why... Why not?

757
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,889
You see,

758
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:22,190
I want to work hard and become successful.

759
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:25,290
I want to save money quickly and buy a house too.

760
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,130
I'm an ambitious man.

761
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,670
I can't really afford to enjoy my life...

762
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,630
until I achieve my goals.

763
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,409
I noticed...

764
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:43,110
that you always drink caramel macchiato after lunch.

765
00:54:43,509 --> 00:54:47,380
If you date me, you'll have to drink instant coffee all the time.

766
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:50,590
The same goes for guobaorou, which you love. You'll...

767
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:52,849
only be able to eat it on your birthday.

768
00:54:56,489 --> 00:54:58,190
I'll be fine with that.

769
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:02,130
No.

770
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:07,599
Living like that is so boring and intense.

771
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:10,739
I wouldn't wish that on anyone else.

772
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:17,080
Because I know that you're a wonderful person,

773
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,920
I do not want you to live that kind of life.

774
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,159
I'm sorry.

775
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,590
What are you doing now?

776
00:56:39,489 --> 00:56:41,460
Can't you tell? I'm doing a facial mask.

777
00:56:42,429 --> 00:56:45,369
This facial mask is from France.

778
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,569
It's very expensive. If I do this regularly,

779
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:51,009
I can go back to looking like I'm in my 20s again.

780
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:55,139
Do you actually believe that?

781
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,310
Why shouldn't I believe it?

782
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,319
To look that young,

783
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:07,659
you'll have to go 40 years back in time.

784
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:09,860
Does that even make sense to you?

785
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,130
You're one greedy woman.

786
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,770
Have I actually been greedy,

787
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,699
I would've never married a man like you.

788
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:24,040
So many handsome, fit guys from rich families...

789
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,770
wanted to marry me!

790
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,880
Oh, yes.

791
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:36,449
What?

792
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,219
What is it?

793
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,389
Is there a problem at the company?

794
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,360
Shall I say it's about the company?

795
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,000
Or is it more about our family?

796
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,630
What do you mean?

797
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,000
Young Joon and Ms. Kim...

798
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:57,069
are dating.

799
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,710
What?

800
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:03,710
You still haven't figured out how to propose to her?

801
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,719
I'm so stressed out about it, and I can't come up with any good ideas.

802
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,790
You're stressed?

803
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,889
This is the biggest crisis of my life.

804
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:18,960
Anyway, don't even bring up the word, "propose", in front of me.

805
00:58:22,129 --> 00:58:23,199
Wait, Young Joon.

806
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:25,169
Pro...

807
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:28,669
You are a professional, so I'm sure you'll be fine.

808
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,879
Right, Young Joon.

809
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,509
Do you like pro...

810
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,910
Do you like professional baseball? You look like a club owner.

811
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,620
Are you having fun?

812
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,049
Yes. It's so fun.

813
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,890
Is "Wedding Peach" boring?

814
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:51,890
I think it's fun too.

815
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,129
But I think...

816
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,230
the CEO of Yumyung Group should be someone who is sharp rather than...

817
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,270
someone who is funny.

818
00:59:03,699 --> 00:59:06,810
I was thoughtless.

819
00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:10,140
I will be less funny and be sharper.

820
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:11,449
Wait.

821
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:27,660
He's so thoughtless. He's very thoughtless.

822
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,469
- Yes, Mother. - Young Joon,

823
00:59:32,899 --> 00:59:36,870
if you're not busy, can you come around the house?

824
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:39,540
I will.

825
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,589
Young Joon, are you...

826
00:59:52,149 --> 00:59:53,549
seeing Ms. Kim?

827
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:00,930
I am sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

828
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,859
I was going to tell you soon.

829
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,569
I...

830
01:00:08,399 --> 01:00:10,270
I want to marry Mi So.

831
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,710
I see.

832
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:24,419
You like Mi So.

833
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,560
Of course, I did.

834
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:35,199
I adored Mi So more than anyone, and I trusted her.

835
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:38,370
I wanted her to stay beside you forever.

836
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,040
But now,

837
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:47,210
I am a little worried.

838
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,609
It seems like...

839
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:57,390
Sung Yeon liked Mi So too.

840
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:00,890
You and Sung Yeon...

841
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:04,390
have been worse than strangers.

842
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:07,230
And you two finally came around.

843
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,969
I am afraid...

844
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,399
you will grow apart again.

845
01:01:15,469 --> 01:01:17,140
I fear that.

846
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,580
You don't have to.

847
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,620
I was drawn to Mi So...

848
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,660
because I thought we were in that place together in the past...

849
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,759
and felt a special connection with her.

850
01:01:42,129 --> 01:01:44,129
But the person who Mi So was with at the time...

851
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,569
wasn't me but Young Joon.

852
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,870
So...

853
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:53,879
Mi So has to be his.

854
01:02:11,859 --> 01:02:13,529
Don't I look better?

855
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:16,160
I think you do.

856
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,100
I am undergoing psychotherapy.

857
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:21,140
At first, I didn't have much expectation.

858
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,370
I think I am getting more and more relaxed.

859
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,370
That's good.

860
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:28,680
Things turned out well for you.

861
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,680
You're thinking of marrying the woman you love.

862
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,580
Did you propose to her?

863
01:02:39,049 --> 01:02:40,419
I guess not yet.

864
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,930
You can't copy others when you propose.

865
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,830
You shouldn't try to show off either.

866
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,569
Then?

867
01:02:55,669 --> 01:02:57,000
Focus on Mi So.

868
01:02:57,609 --> 01:03:00,879
Focus on what Mi So likes the most.

869
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:03,140
And what you want to give her the most.

870
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,649
When you think about that, you will get an answer.

871
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,969
What Mi So likes...

872
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,680
and what I want to give her the best.

873
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:05,140
Mi So.

874
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:09,940
Can you come to my house right now?

875
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:17,080
There is something I need to tell you today.

876
01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:21,202
Mi So.

877
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:28,602
I prepared a classic proposal.

878
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:35,511
Because I am a classical man.

879
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:40,622
Who prepared it?

880
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,022
I did.

881
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:54,962
I am willing to become childish for you.

882
01:05:58,432 --> 01:06:00,471

When I sang you a lullaby, you were really touched.

And it made you sleep well too.

01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:59,112
So I plan to sing to you for the rest of my life.

907
01:09:04,091 --> 01:09:05,152
Every night,

908
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:09,562
please sleep next to me.

909
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,402
You know that I never ask for someone's permission.

910
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:22,671
And yet,

911
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:28,412
I am asking for your permission in the most polite...

912
01:09:30,242 --> 01:09:31,511
and the most romantic way.

913
01:09:53,631 --> 01:09:54,902
Will you marry me?

914
01:10:37,852 --> 01:10:40,581
I finally got an answer with my fifth proposal.

915
01:10:41,122 --> 01:10:44,051
Actually, I proposed first when I was five.

916
01:10:55,931 --> 01:10:57,032
I love you.

917
01:11:01,772 --> 01:11:03,001
I love you too.

918
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:42,912
Who...

919
01:11:43,912 --> 01:11:44,912
Young Joon.

920
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:50,522
What brings you to my house?

921
01:11:51,622 --> 01:11:52,721
Why do you think so?

922
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:54,761
What?

923
01:11:55,322 --> 01:11:56,391
Ms. Kim...

924
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:00,331
What's wrong with Secretary Kim?

925
01:12:01,761 --> 01:12:02,801
I...

926
01:12:03,801 --> 01:12:05,532
can't marry like this.

927
01:12:33,862 --> 01:12:36,062
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

928
01:12:36,662 --> 01:12:38,572
Time is going by so slowly.

929
01:12:38,572 --> 01:12:40,641
Run, time! Please go by quickly.

930
01:12:40,641 --> 01:12:41,641
Just the two of you?

931
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:43,202
I can't let Mom give my girl a hard time.

932
01:12:43,202 --> 01:12:44,872
We will get all of these.

933
01:12:45,272 --> 01:12:47,641
I think we've been here.

934
01:12:48,211 --> 01:12:49,242
Ms. Kim.

935
01:12:49,442 --> 01:12:52,152
- Blind date? - By the way, is it that upsetting?

936
01:12:52,152 --> 01:12:53,282
It was in the past anyway.

937
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:54,622
I hate it.

938
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,251
"Husband".

939
01:12:59,492 --> 01:13:01,662
- Mrs. Lee. - Mr. Lee.

940
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:05,261
Congratulations. You got me sold out.
