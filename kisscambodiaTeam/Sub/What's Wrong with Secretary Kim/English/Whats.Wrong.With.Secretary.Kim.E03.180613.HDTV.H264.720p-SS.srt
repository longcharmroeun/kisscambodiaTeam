1
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,992
Why isn't he coming?

2
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:22,062
Is Mr. Park becoming like Mr. Lee?

3
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:24,472
Why would he call me out on a weekend?

4
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:30,911
Why is it so dark here? There's nobody else here.

5
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:48,152
Ms. Kim. Did you wait long?

6
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:50,251
What are you doing here, Mr. Lee?

7
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,191
I'm here to meet Mr. Park.

8
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:54,762
Mr. Park isn't coming. I told him to ask you.

9
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:55,891
What?

10
00:01:56,622 --> 00:02:00,031
Why would you do that? You could've told me directly.

11
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:02,962
If I asked you to meet me, you would've felt uncomfortable.

12
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:07,672
Let's go.

13
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:10,072
But this place is already closed.

14
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:12,871
Closed?

15
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:14,942
How is that a problem?

16
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:18,211
I have the free pass.

17
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,752
No. No.

18
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:33,232
Oh, my goodness!

19
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,412
Mr. Lee.

20
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,681
I can't... I can't...

21
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,982
- I can't... - Don't be so polite.

22
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:56,181
Just enjoy it.

23
00:02:56,852 --> 00:03:00,262
But still, this is... This is... Wait.

24
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,621
Mr. Lee.

25
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,692
I...

26
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:05,532
Mr. Lee.

27
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:08,961
Do you like it that much?

28
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:11,232
Hooray!

29
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:14,371
Hooray!

30
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,341
You know how to enjoy it to the fullest.

31
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:25,252
Mr. Lee! I am sorry! Save me!

32
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:28,382
Ms. Kim, this time, let's go ride Hurricane Boom Boom...

33
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:32,151
which spins 360 degrees in the air 17 meters above ground.

34
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:39,262
What's wrong?

35
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,102
I am too scared.

36
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:46,072
Why did you ride it then?

37
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:49,202
You asked me to ride it.

38
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:51,072
I thought you liked it.

39
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:59,952
(Episode 3)

40
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:06,651
Are you all right?

41
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:08,792
Yes.

42
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,632
Are you okay, Mr. Lee?

43
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:16,631
No way. You rode it twice. Are you not scared?

44
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:18,131
Of course, I am not.

45
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:22,842
Fear is not something you can feel by riding a ride.

46
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:26,142
Then, what are you scared of, Mr. Lee?

47
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,381
That's...

48
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:39,491
none of your business. Let's go.

49
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,491
Are we going to ride Hurricane Boom Boom?

50
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,061
No. We're going to ride what you want to ride, Ms. Lee.

51
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,142
Mr. Lee!

52
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:27,241
Get on, Mr. Lee!

53
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:29,672
It's not scary at all! Hop on!

54
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,592
This is so nice.

55
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,441
You're really not going to ride it? It's really fun, you know!

56
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,441
I'm fine.

57
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:07,941
I already had my fill from watching you...

58
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,212
ride it seven times.

59
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:12,751
I apologize. I got so excited.

60
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,922
Was it really that fun?

61
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:19,652
Yes. To be honest, I've always wanted to ride a merry-go-around.

62
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:23,361
My family once came here together when I was young.

63
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:25,491
And I really wanted to ride the merry-go-around,

64
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:27,001
but I only got to watch it.

65
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:30,061
Why was that?

66
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,272
It's too expensive to get an all-you-can ride pass...

67
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:33,272
when you have three kids.

68
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:35,441
And even if my parents had bought me one,

69
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:38,011
I was too young and cowardly to have fully taken advantage of it.

70
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:42,642
But still, I managed to have one of my wishes granted today.

71
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,352
That's good to hear.

72
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,392
None for me, thank you.

73
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,571
The steak seems to be a bit tough.

74
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,001
Shall I call the chef over?

75
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,772
No, just enjoy your meal.

76
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,712
It's a bit difficult to cut.

77
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,282
Thank you.

78
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,222
I would have dressed up a bit more...

79
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,321
if I had known that we'd be coming to a place like this.

80
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,662
It's fine. There's nobody else here, after all.

81
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:33,902
There really isn't anyone else here.

82
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:36,102
- I rented this place. - Pardon?

83
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,571
What's been going on with you today, Mr. Lee?

84
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:45,672
Nothing much, really.

85
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:47,611
You've worked so hard for me, for so long.

86
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,381
Yet I feel like I never once properly thanked you.

87
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:54,582
This is my farewell gift to thank you for all of your hard work.

88
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:57,051
A gift?

89
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:15,472
Was riding it seven times not enough for you?

90
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,611
I think it was near that merry-go-around.

91
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,241
This place used to be a group of apartments...

92
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,381
before it was redeveloped and turned into an amusement park.

93
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:26,881
And I used to live there.

94
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:31,951
I think my old place was near where that merry-go-around is.

95
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:35,922
Who knows.

96
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,032
It could have been near where that haunted house is,

97
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,492
or near those public toilets.

98
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:42,532
Come on, that's too much.

99
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,672
Just kidding.

100
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:50,811
Anyway, I remember being fascinated when I heard...

101
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,372
that our house was turning into an amusement park.

102
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:55,382
I was around five years old at the time.

103
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:58,152
So you must have been around nine years old, Mr. Lee.

104
00:08:58,882 --> 00:08:59,912
Yes, I think so.

105
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,252
I wonder what you were doing at that age.

106
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:05,951
Even at that age,

107
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:09,262
I was a skilled, prodigious child who excelled at everything.

108
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:13,801
I see.

109
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,632
But...

110
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,372
fourth grade...

111
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:23,772
wasn't an enjoyable time for me.

112
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,012
So even you make mistakes sometimes too, Mr. Lee?

113
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:31,882
Nine-year-old's are in second grade and not fourth grade, Mr. Lee.

114
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:35,581
That was no mistake.

115
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:36,922
I was in fourth grade...

116
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,951
on account of having skipped two grades, since I was so smart.

117
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:47,961
Why were you unhappy despite being so smart, then?

118
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,672
I was in the same class as my older brother.

119
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,902
I bet the administrators put me in the same class...

120
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,471
because they thought they'd be doing me a favor.

121
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:55,902
But it made things harder for me.

122
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,012
Why?

123
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,412
I fought with my older brother's friends a lot.

124
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:02,481
They'd pick fights with me and pick on me,

125
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,551
saying that I was impudent despite my young age.

126
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:08,152
Even so, you must have been relieved to be with your brother, at least.

127
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:10,451
No.

128
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:12,591
He was even worse.

129
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:15,122
He's trash.

130
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:19,762
It's quite late.

131
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:22,731
I'll escort you home, sir.

132
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:26,002
No, there's somewhere we need to go. Hurry up and finish your food.

133
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,502
Pardon?

134
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:46,551
It's really... cold.

135
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,461
Yes, it sure is.

136
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:57,902
It's fine. I don't like pink.

137
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:01,971
I took this out to put it on myself.

138
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:07,642
Mr. Lee.

139
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,851
In moments like these, the man is supposed to take care of the woman.

140
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:13,382
By doing things like lending her his coat, for example.

141
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:17,691
Who cares about gender roles when it's this cold out?

142
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:20,561
You're right.

143
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,282
There must be a special event somewhere.

144
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,282
No. I prepared this.

145
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:49,581
- What? - I told you.

146
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:51,022
This is your farewell gift.

147
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:58,961
This is amazing.

148
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:01,162
Aren't they so pretty?

149
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:13,782
Yes.

150
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:16,112
Quite pretty.

151
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:40,071
I'm fine.

152
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:41,971
You said that men are supposed to take off his coat.

153
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,321
Goodness, I'm so sorry.

154
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:33,922
You must have been so cold today because of me.

155
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:37,632
No, not at all. I'm tired of this coat now.

156
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:39,091
You can wear it, or throw it out.

157
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,231
All right.

158
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:48,042
At any rate, thank you so much for today.

159
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:51,042
I really had a great time.

160
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:53,042
I guess I could say that I got everything...

161
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,941
that I ever wanted, all thanks to you.

162
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:57,951
- I know, right? - Pardon?

163
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,162
Number one, if there is a place you'd like to go...

164
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:09,492
with a romantic interest, write it down.

165
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:11,591
- An amusement park? - Closed?

166
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:14,002
How is that a problem?

167
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:16,701
I have the free pass.

168
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:29,112
"Number two, write something you want to do with your date."

169
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:30,451
Fireworks!

170
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:33,311
There must be a special event somewhere.

171
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,681
No, I prepared this.

172
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:38,821
Amusement park and fireworks...

173
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:40,191
No way.

174
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:53,701
Thank you for giving me a ride home.

175
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,672
By the way, Mr. Lee,

176
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:58,772
- do you... - Hold on a second.

177
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:00,481
I have something for you.

178
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:11,522
"Number three, write a gift that you want to receive from your date."

179
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:13,422
I wrote a huge stuffed teddy bear.

180
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:16,691
Don't tell me...

181
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:20,132
you have a huge stuffed doll inside your trunk.

182
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,341
That's right.

183
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:31,772
You've worked hard like a cow until now,

184
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:33,642
so I'm giving you this stuffed cow doll.

185
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,681
Its name is Hardworking Cow.

186
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,851
I thought it was such a strange survey.

187
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:44,292
I was going to give you gifts, so I wanted to give what you wanted.

188
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:47,191
I appreciate...

189
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:49,221
that you prepared hard on this just for me.

190
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,292
Don't mention it.

191
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:52,992
I'm willing to do this much if it's for you.

192
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,461
You're hugely mistaken...

193
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:59,931
if you expected I'd change my mind because of your gifts.

194
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,012
I just can't get you, can I?

195
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:07,181
I'll go inside for real then.

196
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:09,181
Wait.

197
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:14,022
There's one more left...

198
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:15,481
that you want.

199
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:17,691
What?

200
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:23,191
"Number three, write a gift that you want to receive from your date."

201
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:25,731
A huge stuffed teddy bear,

202
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:29,362
and a romantic kiss in front of my house.

203
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:00,431
Go home safely.

204
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:10,701
You're hugely mistaken...

205
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:14,172
if you expected I'd change my mind because of your gifts.

206
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,771
I just can't get you, can I?

207
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:21,211
Can't get her, my foot.

208
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:23,781
The curse of the blockbuster has started already...

209
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:25,812
though she wouldn't have a clue about it.

210
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:50,241
Mi So, you remember your blind date...

211
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:52,072
with a local news reporter tomorrow, right?

212
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,041
Oh, right.

213
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,652
You said you wanted to ask something to him too.

214
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,711
Anyway, good luck.

215
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:31,552
Let's go, Superman.

216
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,652
It's your turn this time.

217
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:39,951
I'll do a special favor for you and push you from behind.

218
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:41,122
Thanks.

219
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:42,461
But what should we do?

220
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:44,162
I need to go home now.

221
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,461
Already?

222
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,062
Do you have to go?

223
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:50,902
Sorry, I'll come to see you next time.

224
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:54,271
Really? You'll really come to see me?

225
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:57,471
- Yes. - I won't forget about your name.

226
00:19:57,672 --> 00:19:59,741
Your name is Lee...

227
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,711
- Lee... - There you go again, fool.

228
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,251
My name is Lee...

229
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:23,632
Lee...

230
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:27,471
I can't remember.

231
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:34,112
Gosh, I'm late.

232
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,902
Hardworking Cow, guard my house well.

233
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:18,191
What is this?

234
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:49,822
Mr. Lee.

235
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:51,991
I want to ask you about something.

236
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:55,691
I found this in the stuffed cow's bag.

237
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:57,832
Yes, you must have because I put it in there.

238
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:00,162
Is this mine?

239
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:02,802
You think it's Hardworking Cow's then?

240
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:04,431
You're right.

241
00:22:05,102 --> 00:22:08,602
But I didn't write anything about a necklace in the survey.

242
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:11,812
I always go beyond people's expectation.

243
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:18,812
Why? Am I too cool for you to handle?

244
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:23,382
- Your tie is crooked. - I see.

245
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:49,281
I'll go outside then.

246
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:51,181
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

247
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,431
- Hi, Eun Jung. - Why did you ignore my text?

248
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:20,941
- I sent you a message. - Oh, right.

249
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:23,572
Don't tell me you forgot about your blind date too.

250
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:24,872
No, I didn't.

251
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:26,471
Anyway, good luck.

252
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:29,281
Buy me a bag if you guys end up getting married.

253
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:31,652
It's just a blind date.

254
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:34,681
Anyway, thank you.

255
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:35,882
Bye.

256
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,922
Are you going on a blind date?

257
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:45,362
You must be so excited.

258
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:49,961
Ji Ah, I'm very embarrassed about it,

259
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:51,701
so can you keep it as a secret?

260
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:53,971
- Okay. - Thank you.

261
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:55,041
It's a secret.

262
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:57,541
Of course, I can keep it as a secret.

263
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:08,751
Gosh, you were so busy that you couldn't even think about it before.

264
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:10,791
It's your first blind date, isn't it?

265
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,322
Are you serious? Oh, my goodness.

266
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:16,422
Anyway, I hope you take this chance and make your first boyfriend.

267
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:19,291
She has no experience in dating? Oh, my goodness.

268
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:22,201
That's enough.

269
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:24,372
Okie dokie.

270
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:27,602
You won't know what to do since it's your first blind date.

271
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:30,041
Tell him to bring one of his friends.

272
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,312
I'll accompany you. Let's do a double blind date.

273
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:35,312
She must not like the idea.

274
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:37,582
Is it funny?

275
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:39,052
No.

276
00:25:39,652 --> 00:25:41,451
Wait for me, Ms. Kim.

277
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:45,652
I want to go on a blind date too.

278
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:49,291
"Hello, I'm Bong Se Ra."

279
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,562
I want to do stuff like this.

280
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:59,802
Did you finish writing the first draft...

281
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:02,372
of the vice chairman's speech for tomorrow's track meet?

282
00:26:02,372 --> 00:26:03,541
Of course, I did.

283
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:07,481
I got an amazing score on essay when I entered Seoul National University.

284
00:26:07,612 --> 00:26:11,181
I prepared a perfect speech based on my skills.

285
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,711
I'll see if it's a perfect speech...

286
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:16,382
or a piece of junk, so bring it to me right now.

287
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:17,392
Yes, sir.

288
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:19,922
Are you done preparing...

289
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:21,521
gifts for the employees?

290
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:25,291
Of course, I had it shipped to the gym by 10am tomorrow.

291
00:26:25,662 --> 00:26:28,001
Okay, good job. Here's one more thing.

292
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:31,971
The vice chairman puts a great importance...

293
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:34,302
on physical contacts with his employees.

294
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,701
There's no other chance except for this track meet.

295
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:39,912
- So let's not make any mistake. - Okay.

296
00:26:39,912 --> 00:26:41,112
- Move. - Okay.

297
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:52,691
What about Ms. Kim?

298
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:55,991
Wait, do you want me to drink tea with you?

299
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:59,392
- Then I'll go get some for me too. - That's not what I mean.

300
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:02,731
It means why you're here instead of Kim Mi So.

301
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:05,302
I'm asking her whereabouts.

302
00:27:07,072 --> 00:27:09,771
She wants me to serve tea for you from now on.

303
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:12,812
Oh, is that so?

304
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:23,852
I know I lack in many ways.

305
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:26,052
But I'm going to work really hard,

306
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,991
taking Ms. Kim as my role model.

307
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:30,592
I heard she was going on her first blind date at last...

308
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:32,291
because she was so busy before.

309
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,302
I was so motivated by it.

310
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:35,562
Well, yes.

311
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:40,941
Did you just say a blind date?

312
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:43,912
No.

313
00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:51,582
I've scheduled a meeting with the CEO and directors of Illusion Hotel.

314
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:54,521
The opening preparation of Yumyung Art Hall is going smoothly.

315
00:27:54,521 --> 00:27:57,521
And Ms. Kim is going on her blind date.

316
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:01,461
How dare she wears the necklace I gave...

317
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:03,021
and go on a blind date?

318
00:28:08,662 --> 00:28:10,471
Well, going on a blind date will be no use for her.

319
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,501
- They'll become a couple. - What?

320
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:15,941
Think about it.

321
00:28:16,102 --> 00:28:18,011
Obviously, an ordinary man will come out.

322
00:28:18,011 --> 00:28:19,511
That's exactly what she wants.

323
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:22,181
She wants to date an ordinary man and get married with him.

324
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:26,812
No way, she's already been put under a curse.

325
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,521
The curse of the blockbuster.

326
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:32,221
Why do you keep talking about it since last time?

327
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:34,221
What on earth is the curse about?

328
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:50,271
- Kim Mi So? - Yes?

329
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:53,142
I saw pictures on your social media account, so I found you easily.

330
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:55,842
I'm your blind date, Park Byung Heon.

331
00:28:56,582 --> 00:28:58,011
Oh, hello.

332
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:01,322
You must be hungry. I searched a delicious restaurant nearby,

333
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:03,181
so let's head there quickly.

334
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:04,592
Okay.

335
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:12,791
- Goodbye. - I'm sorry.

336
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:15,832
It doesn't accept reservations because it's a famous place.

337
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:18,072
It's okay. We can wait.

338
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:22,142
Let's decide what we'll order to save some of our time.

339
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,612
- Okay. - I'll go bring a menu.

340
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:26,572
Don't feel lonely, and wait here a little.

341
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,291
It's a really famous place.

342
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:42,261
They piled 24 thin layers of meat and deep-fried them in 1.

343
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,162
It's the traditional Japanese pork cutlet.

344
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,931
- It's a hot place. - I see.

345
00:29:47,832 --> 00:29:51,001
Hold on. Eat this one.

346
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,302
Thank you.

347
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:03,112
It's hard to cut the meat.

348
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:08,681
I'm not sure if I should tell you this when we just met,

349
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:11,852
but you're really beautiful.

350
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:14,191
- Your image... - Gosh, it's hot.

351
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:16,122
- is very hot. - What?

352
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:19,231
Well, that's... I'm sorry.

353
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,832
Your image is very feminine.

354
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:25,132
- I see. Thank you. - You're welcome.

355
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:29,271
- Welcome. - Welcome.

356
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:31,771
- This way. - Excuse me.

357
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:35,241
Mi So, isn't it a bit too loud in here?

358
00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:37,451
Yes, a bit.

359
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:42,221
- I'm sorry. - I'm okay.

360
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:44,721
You should be careful. Goodness.

361
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:47,191
You might break something. I'm sorry.

362
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:48,662
Get out!

363
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:51,291
I'm sorry. My voice was too loud.

364
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:54,431
- They looked shaky from earlier. - I'm okay.

365
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,872
There's really no one here.

366
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:03,241
I rented this place.

367
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:13,112
That's mine.

368
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:15,251
- Pardon? - That's my favorite piece.

369
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:18,392
It's the edge part with crisp, tender,

370
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:20,021
and great textures.

371
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,562
You picked the wrong piece.

372
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,862
I'm sorry. I'll give this back to you.

373
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:29,201
Thank you.

374
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,632
- Do you want mine too? - No, I have plenty.

375
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:34,172
What was that? He just made me embarrassed.

377
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,191
What are you doing here, Mr. Lee?

378
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:58,461
I'm here to meet Mr. Park.

379
00:31:58,461 --> 00:32:01,402
If I asked you to meet me, you would've felt uncomfortable.

380
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:07,102
What's wrong with me? Why do I keep thinking about him?

381
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:10,672
Let me tell you about the curse of the blockbuster.

382
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:14,541
Let's say that you watched a high quality blockbuster...

383
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,912
filmed with the investment worth millions of dollars.

384
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,352
Then you watched a B-movie...

385
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:22,052
filmed with a limited amount of investment.

386
00:32:22,082 --> 00:32:25,122
Would you be satisfied with the second movie?

387
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:27,761
It might feel boring.

388
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:28,922
Exactly.

389
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,832
I rented a whole amusement park, restaurant, and cruise ship...

390
00:32:31,832 --> 00:32:35,931
and escorted her to a blockbuster-like date.

391
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:38,802
So she wouldn't be able to date an ordinary man anymore.

392
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:41,802
I think she would. Isn't that why she's going on a blind date?

393
00:32:42,072 --> 00:32:43,142
What?

394
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:45,172
I like to watch B-movies.

395
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:48,412
Let's go.

396
00:32:56,681 --> 00:32:58,521
You should tell me first before you start.

397
00:33:09,461 --> 00:33:13,332
Isn't their coffee great? I searched hard online to find this place.

398
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:15,741
It smells so nice.

399
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:19,741
Which place serves good food?

400
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:25,382
- That's Ms. Kim. - Do you know her?

401
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:28,582
She's the secretary of my company's vice chairman.

402
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:30,291
Really?

403
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:33,662
- Mi So. - Yes?

404
00:33:33,662 --> 00:33:35,862
Something's stuck next to your ear.

405
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:38,162
- Here? - Under your earlobe.

406
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:39,231
- Here? - Behind your earring.

407
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:42,001
- Here. - 45° towards your chin. Higher.

408
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:43,572
- Here? - Higher. Is it the pork cutlet?

409
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:45,802
- What is it? - I'll check it in a mirror.

410
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:47,302
Excuse me for a second.

411
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:51,172
Oh, my goodness. Is she having a relationship?

412
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:52,741
She's really pretty.

413
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:56,082
Okay.

414
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:59,251
I've got to share this with my colleagues.

415
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,322
Gosh, it was your beauty stuck there.

416
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:03,552
Well, thank you.

417
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:06,751
I'm sorry.

418
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:10,862
Is Ms. Kim still with her date?

419
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:14,331
Be honest with me. You're bothered by it, aren't you?

420
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,302
I'm not at all.

421
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:19,072
I told you she's been put under the blockbuster curse.

422
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:27,842
Gosh, why is Ms. Seol sending me a photo?

423
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,081
Oh, my goodness. Hey, you need to see this.

424
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:31,981
What is it...

425
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:37,291
My gosh, Ms. Kim's blind date must be going very well.

426
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:39,992
Big news.

427
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:42,222
I saw Ms. Kim out on a date with her boyfriend...

428
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:44,432
on the streets with cafes on Garosu-gil.

429
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,862
I could see sparks in their eyes.

430
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:49,932
My gosh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Park.

431
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:52,101
I meant to send this to someone else.

432
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,331
I made a mistake.

433
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:54,871
Gosh, Ms. Seol did this again.

434
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:57,541
Last time, she sent me photos of her pork belly feast.

435
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,842
She makes so many mistakes.

436
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,652
By the way, if there are already sparks on their first date,

437
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:05,751
they'll probably end up dating, don't you think?

438
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,052
Do you know...

439
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:10,322
how it feels when your heart flutters...

440
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:12,422
like there's no tomorrow because you think you just met the one?

441
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:16,291
Right, I guess only business plans make you feel that way.

442
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,731
"Oh, that will be lucrative."

443
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:19,532
I bet that's the only thing you know.

444
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,172
Call her now if you're that anxious, and tell her...

445
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:25,601
to just dump the guy and come back.

446
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:28,371
What... "Anxious"?

447
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:35,342
I see that your sense of humor has improved a lot.

448
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:37,481
Why don't you think about a career change?

449
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:39,012
- You should be a comedian. - What?

450
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:42,222
Your letter of resignation is always welcome.

451
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:49,822
Mr. Lee, please don't say that. I've just found what I'm good at.

452
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:00,742
Why do I keep thinking about Mr. Lee?

453
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:04,472
Forget it. I should focus on my blind date.

454
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,472
Do you enjoy your job?

455
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:08,081
You're a local news reporter, right?

456
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:10,041
Yes, I'm very famous for being quick and delivering...

457
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:11,211
only accurate information.

458
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,081
Oh, do you remember...

459
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:15,351
the congressman's drug use case from a few months ago?

460
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:18,621
- Yes. - I was the one who broke the news.

461
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:20,291
Oh, I see.

462
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,722
Once I set my mind to it, I can...

463
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,561
uncover the truth about anything and everything in the world.

464
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:30,331
Then can you look into an old case for me?

465
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:33,572
It's a kidnapping case from around 1994.

466
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:34,902
A kidnapping case?

467
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:37,911
It has nothing to do with me. It happened to someone I know.

468
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:40,311
But it didn't really get the media's attention back then,

469
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,041
so I couldn't really find any information on it.

470
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:44,411
It happened...

471
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,452
in the redevelopment area, where Yumyung Land is now.

472
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:48,952
I think it was around late autumn of that year.

473
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:54,621
I was born in 1990, so...

474
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:58,432
- That was a joke. - Right, of course.

475
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:00,461
That was a long time ago, so I'm not sure if I can dig anything up.

476
00:37:00,461 --> 00:37:02,231
- It'll be hard, right? - I can do it.

477
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:05,632
Since you're asking me,

478
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:08,001
I'll do my very best to find some information on it.

479
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:09,771
- Really? - Yes.

480
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,941
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

481
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:13,472
All right, then. Let's drink.

482
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:15,112
- Thank you in advance. - No problem.

483
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:18,081
- Gosh, it's hot. - Be careful.

484
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:19,182
I'm all right.

485
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:25,791
Well... I'm not sure if you had a good time today.

486
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:29,262
I'd really like to see you again.

487
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:31,291
Sorry?

488
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:45,541
I'm sorry. I'm used to doing this at my job.

489
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,012
Ms. Kim!

490
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,182
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

491
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:56,581
Mr. Lee, what are you doing here?

492
00:38:07,331 --> 00:38:08,862
I'm disappointed at you, Ms. Kim.

493
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:12,731
Your insincere attitude utterly disappointed me.

494
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:14,902
I apologize, sir.

495
00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:17,411
It is definitely my fault if you felt that way.

496
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:21,441
But may I ask what made you feel that way, sir?

497
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:27,552
Did I forget to complete a task by any chance?

498
00:38:28,552 --> 00:38:32,052
Or is there a problem with the preparation for the track meet?

499
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:33,762
Not that?

500
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:39,891
Then by any chance, is it because I went on a blind date?

501
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:42,331
What? That is complete nonsense.

502
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,972
What does your blind date...

503
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:48,501
have to do with me?

504
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:50,512
That's not what I meant, sir.

505
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:52,711
I thought that you might be mad at me because I kept myself busy...

506
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:55,282
with such a personal matter the day before the track meet,

507
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,311
- which is a very important event. - You're well aware.

508
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:59,911
- Yes, sir. - How can you schedule this...

509
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:01,952
the day before the track meet, knowing how important it is to me?

510
00:39:01,952 --> 00:39:03,081
Do you think this makes sense?

511
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,121
I'm sorry, sir.

512
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:20,172
Why are you laughing?

513
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:23,711
Well... A leaf just fell into your pocket.

514
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:26,271
It looks like a handkerchief, and I thought it was funny.

515
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:29,141
I'll take it off for you.

516
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:55,601
How dare a leaf fall into my pocket?

517
00:39:58,672 --> 00:40:00,742
Anyway, your last day is just around the corner.

518
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:02,182
Stay focused and do your best.

519
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:05,581
Yes, sir. I won't schedule any personal things like blind dates...

520
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:07,652
- until after I leave the company. - Just don't do it.

521
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:09,282
Pardon?

522
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:12,621
What do you mean? Leaving the company or going on blind dates?

523
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:27,072
Mi So.

524
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:29,672
- Pil Nam! - How about fried chicken and beer?

525
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:38,811
My goodness. Hey, did you say he raided your blind date?

526
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,052
- The vice chairman? - Yes.

527
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:41,682
It was my fault.

528
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:43,282
What are you talking about?

529
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:45,021
Why can't you go on a blind date after work?

530
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:46,521
There's nothing wrong with that.

531
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:48,661
But still, we have an important event tomorrow.

532
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:51,191
I should've stayed focused. It is my fault.

533
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,432
- But... - But what?

534
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:57,432
The thing is, I really can't figure him out these days.

535
00:40:57,771 --> 00:40:59,632
Ever since I told him I'd like to resign.

536
00:40:59,632 --> 00:41:00,641
What?

537
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:04,811
One day, he was so cold to me.

538
00:41:05,972 --> 00:41:07,811
Are you training her properly or what?

539
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:09,941
- Pardon? - Will you train her sloppily?

540
00:41:10,112 --> 00:41:11,782
Don't disappoint me and do a good job.

541
00:41:11,782 --> 00:41:15,152
Mr. Lee, when we were messaging each other last night, I was...

542
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:16,992
Let's refrain from discussing personal matters in the office.

543
00:41:17,652 --> 00:41:19,092
Then the other day, he was so sweet to me.

544
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:22,961
There must be a special event somewhere.

545
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:24,762
No, I prepared this.

546
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:26,661
- Pardon? - I told you.

547
00:41:27,132 --> 00:41:28,231
It's your farewell gift.

548
00:41:30,632 --> 00:41:33,202
He could be so shocked by the news that you're leaving the company...

549
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:34,641
that he may have lost his mind.

550
00:41:35,472 --> 00:41:36,641
Don't say that.

551
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:40,012
It happens to many people after an extreme emotional shock.

552
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:41,242
Isn't he...

553
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:43,652
shocked that you're leaving?

554
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:46,152
I'm not sure about that,

555
00:41:46,152 --> 00:41:47,882
but I can tell he hasn't come to terms with it yet.

556
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:49,782
You mean, he can't accept it?

557
00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:53,762
Right, you've been bending over backwards for that guy.

558
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:55,722
I bet he'll feel lost without you.

559
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:57,831
But even with that, I'm not sure...

560
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:59,191
because he can definitely find...

561
00:41:59,191 --> 00:42:02,161
a secretary who's a lot more qualified and experienced than I am.

562
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:04,402
Why on earth is he doing this to me?

563
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:08,742
Isn't he the type that has to have everything he wants?

564
00:42:09,242 --> 00:42:10,242
Yes, he is.

565
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:11,871
If there's a company he likes,

566
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:14,311
he'll probably make it his through merger and acquisition.

567
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:16,882
- That's right. - And if he sees anything he likes,

568
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:18,112
I bet he buys it right away.

569
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,882
Of course.

570
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:21,251
Then we know the answer.

571
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:24,191
This is about his possessiveness.

572
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:27,391
- Possessiveness? - That's right.

573
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:29,561
That's probably what you mean to him.

574
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,731
An object he desired and has made his own.

575
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:33,731
"An object"?

576
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:36,461
An object that's still useful and makes him feel at ease.

577
00:42:37,072 --> 00:42:41,172
But that object suddenly notified him that she'd leave him.

578
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,072
That must've made him furious.

579
00:42:43,072 --> 00:42:45,742
He probably wants to do whatever it takes to make you stay.

580
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:49,612
- You think that's what it is? - Yes, I do.

581
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:52,512
I'm a psychiatrist after all.

582
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:56,081
Anyway, you should leave that company as soon as possible.

583
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:58,351
If he gets more possessive,

584
00:42:58,452 --> 00:42:59,751
you won't be able to get out.

585
00:43:09,532 --> 00:43:11,731
What's wrong? Why are you crying suddenly?

586
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:14,742
I feel so bad for my little sister.

587
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,711
You had to work for that possessive boss...

588
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:20,172
for nine years to help me pay...

589
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:21,441
my college tuition fees.

590
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:25,282
I feel so bad that I can't even look at you.

591
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:28,251
Gosh, why is the conversation turning into this now?

592
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:30,452
I just feel so bad.

593
00:43:36,222 --> 00:43:37,362
Do you have any soju?

594
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:39,791
Let's add some to this.

595
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,402
Hold on. I'll see if I have any.

596
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:50,472
By the way, what's that necklace?

597
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,911
It's pretty. I don't think I've seen it before.

598
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:55,141
Oh, this? Mr. Lee bought it for me.

599
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:57,081
It's like a dog collar, then.

600
00:43:57,952 --> 00:44:00,722
I bet he wanted to shackle your neck to make sure you don't run away.

601
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,021
What?

602
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:21,202
Good morning, Ji Ah.

603
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:23,072
Good morning, Mi So.

604
00:44:25,742 --> 00:44:28,641
Oh, isn't this Morpheus' newest book?

605
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:30,882
I heard it's coming out next month. How did you get it?

606
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:33,351
I heard it already came out in England,

607
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:35,351
so I asked my friend there to send it to me.

608
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:38,521
You must be a fan of Morpheus too,

609
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:40,362
judging from how you know about the newest book.

610
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:43,461
Of course. Morpheus is my all-time favorite novelist.

611
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:46,032
("Moments That I Could See" Republished)

612
00:44:46,032 --> 00:44:48,961
Every book of his has topped the bestseller list.

613
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:53,231
Even the number one movie in the box office now is based on his novel.

614
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:54,641
Isn't he so impressive?

615
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:58,972
By any chance, are you a Morpheusian too?

616
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:01,411
"Morpheusian"? What is that?

617
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:05,012
Oh, it's his fan club. I guess you didn't know.

618
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:06,981
He has a fan club?

619
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:10,552
Of course. He's not some average novelist, you know.

620
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,791
He's an international bestselling author,

621
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,822
and he's so handsome too.

622
00:45:14,822 --> 00:45:16,021
You've seen his face?

623
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:19,191
He neither does interviews nor reveals himself in public.

624
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:21,802
The only thing people know about him is that he's in his 30s.

625
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,501
Come on. His photos have gone around...

626
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:25,972
the members of his fan club.

627
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:27,541
I joined it in its first year.

628
00:45:28,402 --> 00:45:30,842
If you're curious, shall I show you one of his photos?

629
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:34,041
Yes, please.

630
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:37,911
- Don't show anyone else, okay? - All right.

631
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:46,351
You can tell that he's handsome from this photo?

632
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:50,121
Yes. I mean, just look at that. He's definitely a good-looking guy.

633
00:45:50,121 --> 00:45:51,461
He's so tall too.

634
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:55,762
Oh, someone posted a new photo of his on social media last night.

635
00:45:55,762 --> 00:45:58,702
The person wrote that she saw him at an airport in France.

636
00:45:58,702 --> 00:46:00,402
- Really? - Yes.

637
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:03,001
She met him when he was signing a book deal before he became famous,

638
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:04,411
so she recognized him right away.

639
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:05,672
Do you want to see that photo too?

640
00:46:06,771 --> 00:46:07,882
Yes.

641
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:10,481
Here.

642
00:46:12,612 --> 00:46:14,382
You can tell from this photo that he's handsome?

643
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:17,822
Yes, even his chin is so perfect.

644
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,121
He has such great skin too.

645
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:20,262
Right, his skin is visible.

646
00:46:20,592 --> 00:46:21,722
Look at this.

647
00:46:26,362 --> 00:46:28,402
I saw Morpheus at Charles de Gaulle Airport.

648
00:46:28,601 --> 00:46:31,702
We're actually on the same flight to Korea now. We'll take off soon.

649
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:34,072
We'll arrive in Korea together in 11 hours from now.

650
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:38,371
Is this for real? I'll trust you and run to the airport right now.

651
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:41,411
I should keep my eyes peeled for a man wearing a black fedora.

652
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,751
- Excuse me. - Yes?

653
00:46:58,592 --> 00:47:00,561
I think this hat will look great on you.

654
00:47:04,632 --> 00:47:06,172
My gosh, I'm so curious.

655
00:47:06,302 --> 00:47:07,641
I'm dying to see him.

656
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:11,311
Gosh, Morpheus... When will you come out?

657
00:47:11,572 --> 00:47:13,342
There he is! That man wearing a black hat!

658
00:47:13,342 --> 00:47:14,581
- It's Morpheus! - Let's go!

659
00:47:16,682 --> 00:47:19,182
- Morpheus... - You're Morpheus, right?

660
00:47:21,222 --> 00:47:22,751
- What? - It's not him.

661
00:47:23,282 --> 00:47:25,592
- What's going on? - Mor... What?

662
00:47:36,702 --> 00:47:38,331
(Calling Mother)

663
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:40,172
- Hello? - Where are you?

664
00:47:40,472 --> 00:47:42,742
- I just arrived in Korea. - Seriously?

665
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:45,041
Son, you're in Korea now?

666
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,211
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

667
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:50,182
I'm at our vacation home in Jeju Island with your dad now.

668
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:51,952
Oh, really?

669
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:54,882
Wait for me, okay? I'll catch a flight to Seoul right away.

670
00:47:54,882 --> 00:47:57,751
No, it's okay. Don't change your plan because of me.

671
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:00,961
Your dad is never helpful.

672
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,532
He dragged me all the way here because he wanted to play golf.

673
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:05,791
I can't even see my son whom I haven't seen in years.

674
00:48:05,992 --> 00:48:09,262
Shall I just throw him in the sea here?

675
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:12,172
You and Dad are still the same.

676
00:48:13,231 --> 00:48:16,271
Oh, Young Joon is doing well, right?

677
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,641
Young Joon?

678
00:48:17,941 --> 00:48:21,112
Of course. He's busy trying to run the company well.

679
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:23,441
Even today, he's attending...

680
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:25,711
the company track meet in your dad's place.

681
00:48:26,282 --> 00:48:27,351
Really?

682
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:30,751
It sounds like he's doing well.

683
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:40,762
Oh, my. I like your track pants.

684
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:42,001
It fits you very well.

685
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:43,202
Thanks.

686
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:54,182
Is everything ready for the track meet?

687
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:57,481
It starts at 10am, so you can leave in 30 minutes, sir.

688
00:48:58,012 --> 00:48:59,652
Which ones will you two be participating in?

689
00:48:59,851 --> 00:49:02,382
I'll participate in the obstacle race and the three-legged race.

690
00:49:02,382 --> 00:49:04,291
As for me, knee wrestling and table tennis.

691
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:08,391
I hope both of you are determined to come in first place.

692
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:09,492
Pardon?

693
00:49:10,092 --> 00:49:12,992
Isn't the participation itself what matters?

694
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,061
That's what losers say as an excuse.

695
00:49:16,202 --> 00:49:19,101
You must not lose. You should rather die than lose.

696
00:49:19,101 --> 00:49:21,072
Come in first place no matter what.

697
00:49:21,072 --> 00:49:23,572
I told you to stay focused until your last day. You remember, right?

698
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,041
Yes. Of course, sir.

699
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:26,311
See you later, then.

700
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:29,911
Mr. Lee is really something.

701
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:33,621
Who puts their life on the line to win at a company event like this?

702
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,121
Aren't I right, Mi So?

703
00:49:44,632 --> 00:49:46,592
- Okay. - Let's get ready to head out.

704
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:49,032
Don't forget to give the map of the gym to Mr. Yang.

705
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:50,731
Ms. Kim!

706
00:49:52,411 --> 00:49:53,712
Let's get ready to head out.

707
00:49:53,722 --> 00:49:56,092
Don't forget to give the map of the gym to Mr. Yang.

708
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:57,532
Ms. Kim!

709
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,882
It's gone, sir. Are you all right?

710
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:22,282
Who did it?

711
00:50:24,651 --> 00:50:26,892
I forgot to check as I've been all over the place.

712
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:27,992
I'm sorry, sir.

713
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:51,081
Ji Ah, did you not memorize the precautions I wrote down for you?

714
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:54,782
I'm sure I told you no cable ties are allowed in Mr. Lee's office.

715
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:56,581
I'm sorry.

716
00:50:57,392 --> 00:51:01,322
I organized the cables with them because I wanted to impress him.

717
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:04,492
He didn't have to get that angry though.

718
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:08,632
Ji Ah, what kind of attitude is that?

719
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:11,271
- You're the one who made a mistake. - Sorry?

720
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:14,072
I don't like spiders.

721
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:17,371
Whenever I see one, I almost pass out because I hate it so much.

722
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,012
Everyone has a thing or two that they absolutely hate.

723
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:22,682
That's why he's angry, so I don't appreciate you whining like this.

724
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:24,552
I'm sorry.

725
00:51:24,552 --> 00:51:26,351
- You're sorry? - Yes.

726
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:29,151
- Then lend me Morpheus' new book. - Sure.

727
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:31,921
Pardon?

728
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:36,561
Okay.

729
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:56,382
Mr. Lee, this is chamomile tea.

730
00:51:56,642 --> 00:51:58,211
It'll calm you down.

731
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:13,432
I'm sorry, sir.

732
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:16,331
I'll make sure it never happens again.

733
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:19,901
You're leaving soon.

734
00:52:22,202 --> 00:52:23,742
How can you guarantee that?

735
00:52:34,282 --> 00:52:37,291
Maybe it's not about his possessiveness.

736
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:40,461
He might really need me.

(Yumyung Holdings Company Track Meet)

738
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:51,572
(Go, Team Passion! Don't let them beat you.)

739
00:52:51,572 --> 00:52:53,572
(Let's go! Let's win and have a feast!)

(Yumyung Holdings 23rd Company Track Meet)

741
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:06,052
All right. We'll now begin...

742
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:11,322
Yumyung Holdings' 23rd company track meet.

743
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:15,322
I hope no one gets hurt and that we can...

744
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:17,061
bond even more through this meaningful event.

745
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:19,731
We'll begin now.

746
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,972
(Yumyung Holdings 23rd Company Track Meet)

747
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:41,682
Are you all ready?

748
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,691
- Ready. - Go, team!

749
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:46,251
Go, team!

750
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:06,572
- Go! - Go!

751
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,461
- Go! - Go!

752
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:52,092
This is why I like Ms. Kim.

753
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:55,162
With that dogged spirit, she gets her job done.

754
00:54:55,162 --> 00:54:56,791
So you like Ms. Kim?

755
00:54:57,932 --> 00:55:01,032
Not as a woman but as an employee. Look. How great is she?

756
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:04,901
Ms. Kim.

757
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:09,001
I heard you are a perfectionist secretary.

758
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:11,142
Who's that guy?

759
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,142
I see that you are a great athlete too.

760
00:55:13,142 --> 00:55:15,382
Right. But what can I do for you?

761
00:55:15,382 --> 00:55:17,452
There's going to be a three-legged race soon.

762
00:55:17,452 --> 00:55:19,651
I am your partner.

763
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,151
I see.

764
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:23,081
Let's do it well.

765
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:25,892
- Thank you. - Cheers.

766
00:55:33,162 --> 00:55:34,561
What was that, Ms. Kim?

767
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,231
What did you talk about with Ko Gui Nam?

768
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:39,472
Ko Gui Nam? Do you know him?

769
00:55:39,472 --> 00:55:40,802
Of course, I know him.

770
00:55:40,802 --> 00:55:44,771
He ranked first on the company popularity vote.

771
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:47,041
He ranked first? Did he beat Mr. Lee?

772
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:49,382
Mr. Lee is out of everyone's league.

773
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:52,981
Mr. Ko is great, and if you get lucky,

774
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:54,151
he could be yours.

775
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:57,121
But he's such a workaholic that he doesn't take interest in women.

776
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:59,191
Not even me.

777
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:03,362
And he fell for Ms. Kim?

778
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:06,492
Fell for her?

779
00:56:06,662 --> 00:56:10,202
He just gave Ms. Kim water. Isn't that a sign?

780
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:11,972
No, it's not.

781
00:56:11,972 --> 00:56:14,742
He's going to be my partner on a three-legged race.

782
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:18,012
I see.

783
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:20,142
Actually, Ms. Lee,

784
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:23,041
can I join the three-legged race instead? I've been...

785
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:25,512
performing badly today, and I need to make it up.

786
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:29,851
What? Why does she never listen until I finish?

787
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,621
I want to join the three-legged race too.

788
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:37,662
I want to run with Mr. Ko...

789
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,401
and feel my heart race.

790
00:56:42,662 --> 00:56:44,101
Mr. Ko.

791
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:49,441
- Mr. Ko, have some water. - No, have this.

792
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:51,171
No, have this. I will have this.

793
00:56:51,472 --> 00:56:53,112
- Can we take a photo together? - Okay.

794
00:56:53,941 --> 00:56:55,412
Can you take one with me too?

795
00:56:55,941 --> 00:56:57,412
You are amazing.

796
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,822
He's not that handsome.

797
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:03,251
The really handsome man is...

798
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:11,392
My goodness. Who was I thinking about?

799
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:13,331
I must be crazy.

800
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:17,032
The three-legged race will begin shortly.

801
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:20,371
Ms. Kim, should we go to the start line?

802
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:21,572
Okay.

803
00:57:22,802 --> 00:57:25,642
The three-legged race must be next.

804
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:28,242
I wonder how many couples will be formed.

805
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:32,412
80 percent of them end up becoming a real couple.

806
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:33,822
What?

807
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,722
Are you ready? Ready.

808
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:52,132
They look lovely.

809
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:01,182
He touched her.

810
00:58:06,151 --> 00:58:07,882
- Go! - Go!

811
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,291
Team Three has a great teamwork.

812
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:18,092
They are leading.

813
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:21,662
Will they win and become a couple too?

814
00:58:33,112 --> 00:58:35,081
Should we shout it together?

815
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:38,282
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

816
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:41,121
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

817
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:44,251
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

818
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,392
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

819
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,662
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

820
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,961
Date. Date.

821
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:55,061
Date.

822
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,501
Let's shout it together.

823
00:58:58,632 --> 00:59:01,302
We want them to date.

824
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,171
We want them to date.

825
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:06,981
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

826
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:09,642
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

827
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:12,412

828
00:59:12,552 --> 00:59:15,121
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

829
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:18,052
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

830
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:21,021
There won't be any more tract meet starting next year.

831
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:22,662
It's too childish.

832
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:27,561
He's the one who is childish. He's blinded by jealousy.

833
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:29,901
My gosh.

834
00:59:30,444 --> 00:59:31,843
Let's shout it together.

835
00:59:31,843 --> 00:59:34,584
We want them to date.

836
00:59:34,883 --> 00:59:37,553
We want them to date.

837
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,854
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

838
00:59:41,323 --> 00:59:43,863
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

839
00:59:43,863 --> 00:59:46,294
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

840
00:59:46,723 --> 00:59:49,294
- Date. Date. - Date. Date.

841
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:52,533
There won't be any more track meet starting next year.

842
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:54,033
It's too childish.

843
00:59:56,004 --> 00:59:58,803
He's the one who is childish. He's blinded by jealousy.

844
01:00:00,144 --> 01:00:01,214
Gosh.

845
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:06,214
- Are you okay, sir? - Are you okay?

846
01:00:07,254 --> 01:00:09,653
You said you wanted people of Yumyung Group...

847
01:00:09,653 --> 01:00:11,383
to become one without getting injured.

848
01:00:11,953 --> 01:00:13,423
Why are you hurt?

849
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:16,863
Let me see.

850
01:00:17,763 --> 01:00:19,394
I am sorry.

851
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:31,673
Let me see it.

852
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:36,544
Did you drink?

853
01:00:36,814 --> 01:00:37,944
I didn't drink.

854
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:39,144
Then what is it?

855
01:00:39,383 --> 01:00:42,013
How can you just slip on the stairs?

856
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:45,084
I just missed a step. Stop making a fuss.

857
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:47,794
- You have to go see a doctor. - No. I'm going home.

858
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:50,053
What are you talking about? You need a proper treatment.

859
01:00:50,053 --> 01:00:51,723
I am not hurt that badly.

860
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:54,093
No. I will get the car ready.

861
01:00:54,093 --> 01:00:57,434
It will get better quickly if I put hot pack on it.

862
01:00:58,434 --> 01:01:00,064
Can you stand up?

863
01:01:00,133 --> 01:01:02,673
Never mind. I can walk.

864
01:01:04,973 --> 01:01:06,073
Mr. Lee. I...

865
01:01:06,073 --> 01:01:08,843
You are not okay. Lean on me.

866
01:01:08,843 --> 01:01:11,414
- I said I was okay. - Come on.

867
01:01:13,684 --> 01:01:17,354
You better stop unless you want to relocate to India.

868
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:19,453
What?

869
01:01:22,854 --> 01:01:24,323
You should've been more careful.

870
01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:38,504
Take off your socks and put your foot here.

871
01:01:48,513 --> 01:01:50,354
What are you doing? Do you want me to take it off?

872
01:01:51,484 --> 01:01:52,883
This will do.

873
01:01:53,854 --> 01:01:55,854
You want me to put it on top of your socks?

874
01:01:57,863 --> 01:02:00,863
What are you talking about? That's not how you do it.

875
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,604
It doesn't matter. Just do that.

876
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:06,104
No. I will help.

877
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:07,234
Never mind.

878
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:09,734
- Why do you keep saying it's okay? - No.

879
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,564
What are you doing? Come on.

880
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:37,464
Oh, right.

881
01:02:45,604 --> 01:02:47,144
What is that scar?

882
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:49,644
It looks like an old scar.

883
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:00,794
Did you enjoy the track meet?

884
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:03,153
- What? - You seemed to really enjoy it.

885
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:05,363
Especially the three-legged race.

886
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:09,133
There's nothing fun about it.

887
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:10,564
I just tied my leg...

888
01:03:10,564 --> 01:03:13,033
with another guy and ran like crazy to win.

889
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:15,504
"Like crazy"?

890
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:16,803
Participating in the track meet...

891
01:03:16,803 --> 01:03:18,374
is meaningful in itself.

892
01:03:18,374 --> 01:03:20,004
Why would you run as if your life depended on it?

893
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,073
That was stupid.

894
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:22,513
What?

895
01:03:23,314 --> 01:03:24,944
Is my memory wrong?

896
01:03:24,944 --> 01:03:27,053
I thought I heard someone telling me to bet my life...

897
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,153
and to win the game.

898
01:03:29,153 --> 01:03:31,184
How can you take my words so literally?

899
01:03:31,283 --> 01:03:33,153
You are inflexible, Ms. Kim.

900
01:03:35,323 --> 01:03:36,354
My gosh.

901
01:03:39,124 --> 01:03:40,164
Gosh, it's getting hot.

902
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:41,633
Right.

903
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:43,493
If it's for victory,

904
01:03:43,493 --> 01:03:45,133
you don't mind running...

905
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:46,834
very close to a strange man.

906
01:03:46,973 --> 01:03:48,033
Of course.

907
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:50,203
It' better than becoming a loser.

908
01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:52,473
Right. As long as you win,

909
01:03:52,473 --> 01:03:54,843
you don't care about who you touch.

910
01:03:54,843 --> 01:03:55,874
That's right.

911
01:04:02,553 --> 01:04:03,754
Even if that person is this close to you?

912
01:04:04,223 --> 01:04:05,223
Of course.

913
01:04:07,854 --> 01:04:08,953
Even now?

914
01:04:10,153 --> 01:04:11,323
It doesn't affect me.

915
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:16,664
How about this?

916
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:37,783
(Thank you Park Byung Eun for your special appearance.)

917
01:05:04,814 --> 01:05:07,013
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

918
01:05:08,314 --> 01:05:09,984
For the boss to give work to his secretary,

919
01:05:09,984 --> 01:05:11,584
he needs to know about her schedule.

920
01:05:11,584 --> 01:05:12,624
Love?

921
01:05:12,723 --> 01:05:14,153
That's ridiculous.

922
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:16,294
Have I ever told you that you are beautiful?

923
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,464
What's wrong with my heart?

924
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:20,294
You will fall if you walk like this.

925
01:05:20,294 --> 01:05:21,533
He's a sweet man.

926
01:05:21,533 --> 01:05:23,064
He's very different from someone.

927
01:05:23,363 --> 01:05:24,834
Are you wearing perfume, Ms. Kim?

928
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:26,903
No. I don't wear perfume.

929
01:05:27,374 --> 01:05:29,633
Are you worried that I'll fall in love with her?

930
01:05:30,473 --> 01:05:31,673
Ms. Kim is right.

931
01:05:31,673 --> 01:05:35,414
The feeling grows bigger in the dark.
