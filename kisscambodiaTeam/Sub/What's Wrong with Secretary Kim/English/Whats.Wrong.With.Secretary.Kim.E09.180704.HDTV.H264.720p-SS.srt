1
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:24,762
You professed your feelings to me many times.

2
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:27,563
I am sorry for responding so late.

3
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:30,903
I...

4
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:33,833
like you.

5
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,013
Come with me.

6
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,282
I don't want to go alone.

7
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,953
Come with me.

8
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,663
(Episode 9)

9
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:45,473
Wait.

10
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:48,742
Why don't we make it clear now?

11
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:50,142
Pardon me?

12
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:53,342
We stopped being ambiguous and became a couple,

13
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:54,983
right?

14
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,853
- That's right. - "That's right."

15
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:03,923
People might think you are presenting a quiz show.

16
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,353
Why do you sound so formal?

17
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:08,923
But it's true.

18
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,772
Wait for me.

19
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,272
My lady.

20
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,312
Wait for me, My Lady.

21
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:34,682
Wait for me, My Lady.

22
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,302
Take care going home, sir.

23
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:54,742
Why are you looking at me like that?

24
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,043
I don't want to part with you.

25
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,413
Ms. Kim,

26
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:08,122
like I told you earlier, I am smart,

27
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,122
healthy, rich, and competent.

28
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,293
So...

29
00:04:14,592 --> 00:04:15,923
marry me.

30
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,693
As soon as possible.

31
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:24,802
We started dating less than an hour ago.

32
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:26,932
Don't you think you're rushing it too much?

33
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,273
Who rushed it more?

34
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:33,372
What did you say?

35
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:35,483
It's nothing.

36
00:04:36,382 --> 00:04:37,452
Go in.

37
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:39,653
Okay. I will see you tomorrow then.

38
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:24,393
Here I come.

39
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,632
Here I come.

40
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,033
This is fun!

41
00:05:32,202 --> 00:05:33,702
You ride on it now.

42
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:37,773
I'll make a special exception and push you since it's you.

43
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:39,312
Thanks.

44
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:41,483
But you know, the thing is...

45
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,343
I want to marry you.

46
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:46,312
M... Marry me?

47
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:48,983
Yes. You're just like a prince.

48
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,853
Promise me.

49
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:54,463
I'll come back next time to see you, Mi So.

50
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,333
I can't stand it.

51
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:09,502
Wait, why did you come back?

52
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:12,213
In case one of us misses the other all night long.

53
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:17,882
I'm talking about you, Ms. Kim.

54
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,583
I came back in case you miss me all night long.

55
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:29,593
You know that...

56
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,293
I'm someone who doesn't give second chances, right?

57
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,673
But I want to offer only you a second or even third chance.

58
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,002
A chance to see me, that is.

59
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,612
Well?

60
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,643
Don't you feel honored that you've become a special person to me?

61
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,213
Yes, it's an honor.

62
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,752
Sweet dreams, Ms. Kim.

63
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,122
You know what I mean by "sweet dreams", right?

64
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:01,293
Of course. I'll dream of you, Mr. Lee.

65
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:11,932
Let me hug you one more time.

66
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:24,952
I think...

67
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:27,653
that I'll have sweet dreams tonight too.

68
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:36,663
You have a meeting with the company executives tomorrow.

69
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:39,432
It'd be best for you to head home and get some sleep, sir.

70
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:44,233
I actually don't mind hearing your nagging today.

71
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:50,143
Hurry up and head back inside, Ms. Kim.

72
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:51,843
You head home first, sir.

73
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:16,192
Hey, corner of my mouth. Stop lifting like that.

74
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,373
Looks like I can't stop you.

75
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,732
Promise me.

76
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:57,273
I'll come back to see you next time, Mi So.

77
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,273
Really?

78
00:09:58,273 --> 00:09:59,572
You'll really come back to see me, right?

79
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:00,873
Yes.

80
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,102
I definitely won't forget your name.

81
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,812
Lee Sung Yeon.

82
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:16,952
Yes.

83
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,523
It definitely was Sung Yeon.

84
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:41,812
Is he not feeling well?

85
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,982
He's doing things that are so uncharacteristic of him.

86
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:46,452
- Pardon? - I'm talking about Young Joon.

87
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:47,753
He was nodding off during the meeting earlier,

88
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:48,883
and he's sleeping now.

89
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,153
Again?

90
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,893
He overslept this morning too...

91
00:10:51,893 --> 00:10:53,523
and was almost late to the executives' meeting.

92
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,863
The almighty Lee Young Joon never lets his guard down.

93
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:01,763
What's going on with him?

94
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,202
I have no idea.

95
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:07,302
Oh, yes.

96
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:09,773
Want me to show you something funny?

97
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:11,673
Something funny?

98
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,092
Vice Chairman.

99
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:29,893
Yes, what is it?

100
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,562
Do you like your mom more or your dad more?

101
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:45,013
I can't believe he answers people even when he's sleeping.

102
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:48,212
Maybe Young Joon's brain is switched on 24 hours of the day.

103
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,582
I guess so. I only just found out about this myself.

104
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:54,952
It's the first time I've seen him so relaxed like this.

105
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:56,923
Did something happen...

106
00:11:56,923 --> 00:12:00,052
to cause such a significant cognitive shift?

107
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:09,062
Yes, Ms. Seol? Yes, I'm on my way now.

108
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,332
Can you prepare those materials...

109
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:13,572
She hung up on me. Take care then, Ms. Kim.

110
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,423
Mr. Lee.

111
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,653
Mr. Lee!

112
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,572
He woke up last time because he got sleep paralysis,

113
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,873
but he looks relaxed now.

114
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:29,743
Where do you think you're going, leaving a sleeping person behind?

115
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,163
What if someone sees us, Mr. Lee?

116
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,403
Nobody would dare to just burst in here.

117
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:49,503
Don't worry about it.

118
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:53,533
It's not that I'm worried.

119
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,003
What is it, then?

120
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:58,143
You should be prepared to handle this much...

121
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,812
if you've awakened one's slumbering desires.

122
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:04,352
Slumbering... what?

123
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,413
Desires.

124
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,822
"Desires"? How could you use such an embarrassing word...

125
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,722
as if it's completely normal?

126
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,232
Prepare yourself,

127
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:22,363
because I won't slow down now.

128
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:33,413
By the way, you're not feeling ill, are you?

129
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:37,783
I'm just asking because you've never slept like this before.

130
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:42,482
A huge weight was lifted off my shoulders after yesterday.

131
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:44,923
And I don't think I'll have nightmares anymore, either.

132
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,052
Pardon?

133
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,692
Call Doctor Choi,

134
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:51,562
and tell him that he doesn't need to prescribe me sedatives anymore.

135
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:54,403
Are you really all better now?

136
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,273
I'm not ill...

137
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,072
anymore.

138
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:01,942
"Anymore".

139
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,482
Why are you looking at me like that?

140
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:12,482
There's something I wanted to ask you.

141
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:16,722
Is the boy I'm looking for...

142
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:20,092
really Mr. Sung Yeon?

143
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:29,562
Why do you ask something obvious?

144
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,572
It may sound weird,

145
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:37,513
but I keep having this thought that you're the boy in my memory.

146
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:40,942
You've acted like...

147
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,613
someone with a traumatic experience so far.

148
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:45,653
You have scars on your ankles too.

149
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,052
It'd be great if someone you like is the boy you've been looking for,

150
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:51,993
but I'm not him.

151
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,722
My nightmares and scars...

152
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:57,893
have nothing to do with that incident.

153
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:05,133
And whether I'm that boy or not, what does that matter?

154
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:08,342
Does that change your feelings towards me?

155
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:12,913
No, that's not true.

156
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,942
Regardless of that,

157
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:20,722
I like you.

158
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:27,092
Well, then.

159
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:30,893
Get some more sleep.

160
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:50,113
Yes, I'll be there at around 7pm.

161
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:53,182
I'll text you the passcode,

162
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:56,222
can you unlock the door and put in the stuff if you arrive first?

163
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:57,923
Thank you, bye.

164
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:04,232
I'm moving today.

165
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:05,932
But it's a weekday.

166
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:07,802
It's cheaper on weekdays.

167
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,602
I just got employed,

168
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:13,032
so my parents paid for the deposit and the moving service too.

169
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:15,403
I need to reduce the budget as soon as possible for them.

170
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:19,913
It must be hard to go independent after living with your parents.

171
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:23,883
Still, it's a must to become a career woman like you.

172
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:28,423
I'll live in a nearby house and focus more on work.

173
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,492
Isn't it time for your meeting with the business team by the way?

174
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:32,792
Pardon?

175
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:35,623
Goodness.

176
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,363
I'll focus more on work from now on.

177
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:43,633
- See you. - Bye.

178
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:50,673
(Lee Sung Yeon)

179
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:11,893
The person you're calling isn't available at the moment.

180
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,873
Have you waited for a long time?

181
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:22,603
It's okay.

182
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,573
Your book concert is getting a lot of positive comments.

183
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:28,212
Our agency almost got jammed from operating.

184
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:30,442
They're requesting interviews and TV appearances.

185
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:32,782
You'll keep accepting these requests, right?

186
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,222
No, I won't.

187
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,222
It'd be great if you do.

188
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:39,923
You're a great speaker too.

189
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:42,623
I really enjoyed your book concert, you see.

190
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:46,633
Especially, when you expressed your feelings to your crush.

191
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:52,232
She was there, right?

192
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:57,143
She must've been so touched.

193
00:19:10,653 --> 00:19:12,323
- Ms. Seol. - Yes, sir.

194
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:17,393
Mr. Choi went for his reserve forces training,

195
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:19,133
so can you be my driver for today?

196
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:21,663
I'll need to go through my papers on the way.

197
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:23,563
Sure, leave it to me.

198
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:25,972
I'll escort you without any mistakes.

199
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,803
You won't escort me to the gate of death, right?

200
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,573
Of course, not.

201
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:03,913
Did you ask for me?

202
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,373
We can have lunch together, right?

203
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,982
Yes, it's possible since you don't have any lunch meeting.

204
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:12,512
It's the first meal together ever since we started dating.

205
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:15,252
I want the place to be a bit special.

206
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,692
I'll reserve a special restaurant then.

207
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:20,292
Not those places where we frequent. I want somewhere new.

208
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:23,823
Okay, I'll make a list of new restaurants.

209
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:25,593
How about we prepare cake too?

210
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,803
We need to celebrate this special moment.

211
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:30,573
Okay, I'll prepare your favorite, rare cheesecake.

212
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:31,803
Good.

213
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,343
What is this?

214
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,673
Is this really how couples engage in conversation?

215
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:43,952
It's what I always do, but I feel kind of bad this time.

216
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:54,123
Though it's childish, should we put some candles?

217
00:20:54,863 --> 00:20:56,393
That's not necessary.

218
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,732
Still, I prepared this to celebrate the beginning of our romance.

219
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:03,762
You mean, I prepared this, because I made a reservation.

220
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:35,833
Does the food suit your taste?

221
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:37,972
Yes, it's delicious.

222
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:40,603
Thank you very much. You look like a great couple.

223
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,502
Others might think you're his secretary.

224
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,583
Enjoy your food.

225
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:05,992
Let's not go back to the office and enjoy a little more of our date.

226
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,633
What?

227
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:10,363
Let's walk a little and watch a movie.

228
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:11,732
No, sir.

229
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:15,603
You didn't have to make that straight face.

230
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:17,143
I don't have any schedule in the afternoon anyway.

231
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:18,873
Still, you have to keep your place.

232
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:22,442
It's not right to do your personal business during your work hours,

233
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:23,682
especially not a date.

234
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,623
- It's confusing. - What?

235
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:30,383
You seem like my secretary at times like this.

236
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:36,893
You seem like my girlfriend at times like this.

237
00:22:39,462 --> 00:22:41,603
I think we need to make things clear a little.

238
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,403
What do you mean?

239
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:46,702
You've naturally supported me so far,

240
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:49,873
but it seems like it's making me a bad man now.

241
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:51,073
I don't feel so good about this.

242
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:55,413
For example, you poured me water...

243
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:58,913
and handed me a handkerchief a while ago.

244
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,383
Those aren't how couples normally do.

245
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,923
It can't be helped.

246
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,653
It's my job...

247
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:08,623
to make you comfortable before you do.

248
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,292
That's why we need to make things clear.

249
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:13,393
From now on, support me only about work-related issues.

250
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,863
I'll take care of other personal issues myself.

251
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:19,133
- Still, that's a bit... - Just do as I say.

252
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,972
I may be your selfish boss,

253
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,442
but I don't want to be your selfish boyfriend.

254
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:41,262
Okay.

255
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,833
Ms. Seol, you won't make a mistake again, will you? Don't get lost.

256
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:46,792
Don't worry.

257
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:48,303
I know a lot about this area.

258
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,833
I can get to the destination with my eyes closed.

259
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,472
We won't happen to close our eyes forever, right?

260
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:56,002
Look, we're almost there.

261
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:58,813
This is so unusual. It's making me more nervous...

262
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:00,583
now that you aren't making any mistake.

263
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,432
Wait, isn't she...

264
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,133
Isn't she your ex-wife?

265
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:43,752
He could be her male friend.

266
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:52,692
You wouldn't have seen her if I had gotten lost.

267
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,202
Why didn't I make any mistake today of all the other days?

268
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,432
Sorry.

269
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:04,373
I'm all right, so don't bother.

270
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:29,502
No, no.

271
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:38,042
Is there anything you need?

272
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:39,712
Indifference.

273
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:43,282
I need your indifference and laziness.

274
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:52,593
Maybe I talked too much during the meeting.

275
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,492
- My neck hurts. - Good job.

276
00:25:58,363 --> 00:25:59,532
What in the world?

277
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:07,073
Goodness, sir.

278
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,573
What are you doing?

279
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:11,113
You should've told me if you needed to copy something.

280
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,212
- I will... - I'll do it, sir.

281
00:26:13,212 --> 00:26:16,682
No, I'm done already, and I've mastered using this machine too.

282
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:20,522
I even know how to make copies after enlarging and reducing sizes.

283
00:26:20,522 --> 00:26:22,423
I'll take care of making my own copies from now on.

284
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:31,932
Thanks.

285
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:46,373
Why are you all standing there?

286
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,742
Did you leave your seat by any chance?

287
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,413
No, I was sitting on my desk all along.

288
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:53,923
How could this happen then?

289
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:55,353
What? What's going on?

290
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:57,722
You see, the vice chairman...

291
00:26:57,722 --> 00:27:00,053
was making a copy himself.

292
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:02,623
- What? Are you serious? - Yes.

293
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,192
I almost got a heart attack.

294
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:08,833
You all heard my heart stop, right?

295
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:10,333
Goodness.

296
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,992
I can't believe this flustering situation.

297
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,363
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

298
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,603
You need to go to the CFO's office. He's looking for you.

299
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:47,972
Okay.

300
00:27:58,113 --> 00:28:01,623
About the vice chairman's cookies, they looked so expensive and tasty.

301
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,553
Should we try just one piece? What do you say?

302
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:08,563
You want some?

303
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:10,792
No.

304
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:12,962
Please forget about the stupid things that I just said.

305
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:16,603
I've never put my hands on your cookies before.

306
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,202
- Right? - Yes.

307
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:46,232
Did he just get his cookies and tea himself?

308
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:48,502
I saw it with my own eyes.

309
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:50,403
It really scared me.

310
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:52,573
What's wrong with him today?

311
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,143
He copied his papers and even got refreshments himself.

312
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:57,373
I think I know.

313
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:00,883
If you can handle it, gather up.

314
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:03,512
- We've gathered already. - Come on.

315
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:05,883
I think...

316
00:29:08,452 --> 00:29:11,752
it's his silent oppression before the layoff like,

317
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:15,163
"I can do anything even without you guys."

318
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:18,432
What? I don't think so.

319
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:20,262
I think so.

320
00:29:20,262 --> 00:29:22,532
Otherwise, how would you explain...

321
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:24,673
his strange behaviors?

322
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:28,403
- Right, but... - What should we do?

323
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,212
My daughter will turn one soon...

324
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:34,012
That's not the problem. What should we do with my loan?

325
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:37,182
I'm doomed. I have so much food which I want to eat.

326
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:39,452
You must all be worried.

327
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:42,982
You should've improved your resumes before getting fired...

328
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,353
like me.

329
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:49,163
Why didn't you improve your personality along with your resume?

330
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:52,232
I see your personality is at the bottom.

331
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:54,403
What about me?

332
00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:57,633
Bae Hyun Seung.

333
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:00,803
You're an intern, so you're good.

334
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:04,512
Are they really going to have someone laid off?

335
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:07,113
It's like the calm before the storm.

336
00:30:07,212 --> 00:30:09,413
What on earth is happening?

337
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:17,952
You're back.

338
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:37,512
Wait.

339
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:40,682
It's the first tea made by me.

340
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:44,712
Right, I better give this to Ms. Kim.

341
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:49,282
Wait here.

342
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:14,913
Did you want to see me?

343
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:16,442
Sit over there.

344
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:27,222
I made that tea for the first time in my life,

345
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:28,492
and I want you to have it.

346
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:30,323
Try tasting it.

347
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:33,292
I have something to tell you.

348
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:34,962
Let's talk after you drink that first.

349
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:38,373
That tea which I made for the first time might grow cold...

350
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:39,833
at this rate.

351
00:31:41,673 --> 00:31:42,843
Okay.

352
00:31:52,482 --> 00:31:55,522
Gosh, it's hot.

353
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:57,752
It's hot.

354
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:01,563
Are you okay? Did you burn yourself?

355
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:04,063
- Open your mouth. - No.

356
00:32:04,063 --> 00:32:05,863
- I'm okay. - Open it.

357
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:07,932
- No, I'm okay. - Open it.

358
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,722
I have something tell you all.

359
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:41,702
Actually, today is a bit...

360
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:43,732
special to me.

361
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,803
It's a special day for you?

362
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:48,873
Well, it's...

363
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:52,113
the first day of team communication...

364
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:53,942
which I decided to proceed starting this year.

365
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:58,212
The first day of team communication?

366
00:32:58,452 --> 00:32:59,452
Yes.

367
00:32:59,512 --> 00:33:02,623
It's a day to make eye contact with each and every one of you...

368
00:33:02,623 --> 00:33:06,192
and share my grateful heart with you.

369
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:10,063
And my first target is her.

370
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:18,573
Okay, then. I'll start making eye contact...

371
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:20,173
with my second target.

372
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:24,042
Mr. Jung.

373
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:37,222
Thank you for your hard work.

374
00:33:44,863 --> 00:33:46,393
Good to see you.

375
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:48,563
Excuse me, sir.

376
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:53,202
You have a pile of documents to look over.

377
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,542
You have to confirm them quickly in order to get them processed.

378
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:59,673
- Is that right? - Yes.

379
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,682
It's unfortunate, but I'll have to wait until next year...

380
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:08,583
to make eye contact with the rest of you.

381
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:13,053
Good job, guys.

382
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,933
- Well... - Goodbye.

383
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:46,453
I don't understand.

384
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:49,363
Day of team communication all of a sudden?

385
00:34:49,593 --> 00:34:53,292
I know. Maybe he recently felt the need for communication in our team.

386
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:56,602
No, I think I got the situation.

387
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:58,703
I'm sure...

388
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,642
it's because of Ms. Kim.

389
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:05,412
What? I don't know what you're talking about.

390
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,383
Be honest.

391
00:35:08,683 --> 00:35:11,582
You kept it a secret from us...

392
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:17,993
and suggested this to him, right?

393
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,352
To make this chance and take care of us.

394
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:24,133
I mean, he's not the person who'd come up with such an idea.

395
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,832
It's obviously your idea.

396
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:28,832
Is it really true, Ms. Kim?

397
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:31,533
Well... Yes, sort of.

398
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,473
Gosh, you! You! Seriously.

399
00:35:35,642 --> 00:35:37,673
Don't suggest ideas like that.

400
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:40,412
I was so uncomfortable the whole time.

401
00:35:40,412 --> 00:35:41,812
Gosh, my goodness.

402
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:44,553
But he took the time to be attentive to us.

403
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:46,212
I guess we're not getting laid off after all.

404
00:35:47,453 --> 00:35:49,453
You're right. If that's the case...

405
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:51,453
Why is he so different today?

406
00:35:57,477 --> 00:36:02,477

408
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:12,412
I'm so impressed with myself.

409
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:14,843
How did I come up with such a great idea right on the spot?

410
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:25,993
What do you say, Ms. Kim?

411
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:28,122
Wasn't that so natural?

412
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,122
Sir.

413
00:36:32,562 --> 00:36:35,433
You taking care of your personal tasks on your own...

414
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:37,502
makes me uncomfortable.

415
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,102
Was that a slip of the tongue?

416
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:46,412
Don't you mean to say "comfortable" and not "uncomfortable?"

417
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:49,142
No, not at all.

418
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:52,553
I don't want to get special treatment just because we're dating.

419
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,453
It'd hurt my pride.

420
00:36:56,723 --> 00:36:59,392
You don't like that I'm taking care of my own tasks?

421
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,363
I've been taking care of them for you for the past nine years.

422
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:05,732
So, please allow me to continue doing them for you.

423
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:06,892
I should get back to work.

424
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:09,433
Ms. Kim.

425
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:11,473
I get what you're trying to say.

426
00:37:12,473 --> 00:37:16,073
But the thing is, I don't want you to do such petty tasks...

427
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:17,712
"Petty tasks"?

428
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:23,953
Taking care of such tasks is part of my job.

429
00:37:24,412 --> 00:37:26,852
I work hard to do a perfect job even with such tasks...

430
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:28,723
and seeing my boss satisfied with my work...

431
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:30,323
makes me proud.

432
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:33,962
But your word choice...

433
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:36,863
makes it sound like you disrespect what I do, and my feelings are hurt.

434
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,033
You're hurting my feelings here.

435
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:45,002
Do you really not know why I took care of those tasks on my own?

436
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:48,303
I'm used to having everything taken care of for me.

437
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:51,073
Do you think it was easy for me to try to do them myself?

438
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:54,183
It was hard, but I wanted to do it for you.

439
00:37:54,712 --> 00:37:56,412
I wanted to be good to you.

440
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:02,423
But still, don't do it again.

441
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:05,993
This is our workplace,

442
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:07,863
and we're supposed to be working now.

443
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:11,493
I'll have to keep being like this to draw the line between the person,

444
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:13,162
Kim Mi So, and being your secretary.

445
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:17,102
I mustn't be confused.

446
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:19,673
I hope you can understand.

447
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:24,542
You're too rational.

448
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:28,343
Well, then. I should get back to work.

449
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:39,953
Everything she said is right.

450
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:42,993
But why do I feel like this?

451
00:38:51,803 --> 00:38:53,602
(Vice Chairman Lee Young Joon)

452
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:05,183
Well... Ms. Kim.

453
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:09,283
Did you do something to get on Mr. Lee's nerves by any chance?

454
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:11,423
No, I didn't.

455
00:39:11,553 --> 00:39:14,763
It looks like something's up. It's so tense in this office now.

456
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:19,392
I don't know what happened, but can't you just apologize to him?

457
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,633
I'm so scared now. My heart keeps pounding.

458
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:26,173
Well, I don't think I did anything to apologize for.

459
00:39:26,673 --> 00:39:27,743
But still...

460
00:39:28,343 --> 00:39:30,372
You've been bending over backwards for Mr. Lee...

461
00:39:30,372 --> 00:39:32,173
even when you did nothing wrong.

462
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:34,883
Sorry?

463
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:04,642
I just don't get it.

464
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:06,613
How can she be so rational?

465
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,442
How can she be so meticulous about everything?

466
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:10,852
She's a total workaholic who only cares about work.

467
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:12,883
Didn't you like how rational, meticulous,

468
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:14,752
and work-focused Ms. Kim is?

469
00:40:15,183 --> 00:40:16,852
Isn't that why you've kept her for nine long years?

470
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:19,723
She doesn't understand how men think and feel.

471
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:21,223
Is it because she's never dated anyone before?

472
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:26,093
You've never been in a relationship before either.

473
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,203
I was head over heels for her even just a few hours ago,

474
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:31,903
but I feel as if a small problem has turned into a big disaster now.

475
00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:34,673
He ignores me whenever I say things that make him uncomfortable.

476
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:37,872
Well, anyhow...

477
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:40,343
It happens in all relationships.

478
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:42,542
A slight difference of opinion...

479
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,482
can cause a big conflict.

480
00:40:44,982 --> 00:40:46,053
But the thing is,

481
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:48,723
when couples fight about such things often...

482
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:50,653
and start to take time apart from each other,

483
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:52,723
the relationship will end on a sour note.

484
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:55,292
- Like what happened to me. - What?

485
00:40:55,493 --> 00:40:58,363
We just started dating. Are you cursing us or what?

486
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:01,002
Mr. Lee.

487
00:41:02,403 --> 00:41:03,462
Young Joon.

488
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:07,843
Don't let the fight drag on for too long.

489
00:41:09,573 --> 00:41:10,812
If you do, you guys will break up,

490
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,142
like what happened to me.

491
00:41:40,673 --> 00:41:41,772
What's with him?

492
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:53,352
But still... You've been bending over backward for Mr. Lee...

493
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:55,022
even when you did nothing wrong.

494
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,093
I used to have no problem apologizing to him...

495
00:41:58,093 --> 00:42:00,053
even when did nothing wrong.

496
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:03,423
For some reason, it's not that easy anymore.

497
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:07,732
Will we be able to make up when we talk later?

498
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:21,442
Ms. Kim, would you be okay with me leaving for the day now?

499
00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:22,743
I'm moving today.

500
00:42:23,283 --> 00:42:25,953
Oh, sure. You should get going. Good luck with the move.

501
00:42:25,982 --> 00:42:28,223
- Thank you. See you tomorrow. - Bye.

502
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:47,203
Is everything on my schedule for today...

503
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:49,002
done?

504
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:52,772
Tell me that the two of us still need to make up.

505
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:56,042
Yes, there's nothing else on your schedule for today, sir.

506
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:01,423
Say that we should clear up misunderstandings over dinner.

507
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:02,883
All right, then.

508
00:43:04,252 --> 00:43:05,852
You should call it a day too.

509
00:43:06,423 --> 00:43:09,192
Tell me not to leave just yet and say we should do something together.

510
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:12,033
Sure. I'll leave for the day too, then.

511
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,263
Say, "Ms. Kim can call it a day,"

512
00:43:15,263 --> 00:43:17,203
"but Kim Mi So should go on a date with me."

513
00:43:17,403 --> 00:43:18,403
All right.

514
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:21,473
Then I'm off.

515
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:26,743
Say, "Why are you standing there? Come with me."

516
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:29,982
Come on! Tell me not to leave.

517
00:43:41,093 --> 00:43:42,622
Gosh, you frustrate me so much.

518
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:47,433
Mom, it's Unit 301, not 302. How many times do I have to tell you?

519
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:50,133
Anyway, you can send it to this address.

520
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:51,573
Okay.

521
00:43:52,872 --> 00:43:53,973
Hello.

522
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:55,872
- They're for Unit 301, right? - Yes.

523
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:57,312
I'm sorry I'm late.

524
00:43:57,312 --> 00:43:59,513
- It's all right. We're almost done. - Okay, thank you.

525
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,962
Nice. Beautiful.

526
00:44:30,872 --> 00:44:31,973
My, this is...

527
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:34,082
This will be so useful.

528
00:44:39,912 --> 00:44:40,923
Let's go home.

529
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:52,863
Hello.

530
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:55,633
Have you seen my fan here by any chance?

531
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:57,832
That fan? Is it yours?

532
00:44:58,002 --> 00:45:00,203
The guy who lives in the rooftop room took it.

533
00:45:00,203 --> 00:45:01,203
What?

534
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:14,283
I thought someone threw you out because you were broken,

535
00:45:14,283 --> 00:45:15,683
but you work just fine.

536
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:17,192
I shall call you...

537
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:19,022
the fan version of Ko Gui Nam,

538
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:20,122
Ko the Fan.

539
00:45:21,392 --> 00:45:22,423
Ko the Fan.

540
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,203
Hey, what are you doing here?

541
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:30,263
Oh, did you move today? Are you giving out rice cakes to neighbors?

542
00:45:30,973 --> 00:45:32,133
Rice cake, my foot.

543
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:36,102
He really stole my fan.

544
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:38,942
What is your problem? Why did you take my fan?

545
00:45:39,542 --> 00:45:42,542
Oh, is this yours?

546
00:45:43,142 --> 00:45:46,613
I brought it home because I thought someone had thrown it out.

547
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:50,892
It's your fault. Why did you leave it out on the street like that?

548
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:53,723
What are you talking about? I was moving my stuff into my apartment.

549
00:45:53,723 --> 00:45:56,263
And how could you assume someone had thrown it out?

550
00:45:56,263 --> 00:45:57,562
It looks and works totally fine.

551
00:45:57,562 --> 00:46:00,232
These days, people throw out things that aren't even broken.

552
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:03,703
Look at this table. I brought home what someone had thrown out...

553
00:46:04,872 --> 00:46:06,872
I mean, not this specific table.

554
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:09,203
Anyway, it's too bad.

555
00:46:09,703 --> 00:46:12,513
I'll return it to you, with no questions asked.

556
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,783
What's there to ask? It is mine.

557
00:46:21,283 --> 00:46:22,352
Goodness.

558
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:35,263
(Pil Nam)

559
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:40,102
Hey, Pil Nam.

560
00:46:41,372 --> 00:46:42,973
Forget it. I don't want to drink.

561
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,013
I'm tired.

562
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:48,442
Okay, bye.

563
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:05,392
This looks so good.

564
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:10,433
A moving day isn't complete without eating Chinese food.

565
00:47:18,613 --> 00:47:19,812
Who is it?

566
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:30,892
What... What are these cherry tomatoes for?

567
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:33,223
What do you mean?

568
00:47:33,923 --> 00:47:36,392
I planted the seeds myself, watered them,

569
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:38,662
and made sure they get enough sunlight. They're...

570
00:47:38,662 --> 00:47:41,033
my precious cherry tomatoes that I raised like my own children.

571
00:47:44,803 --> 00:47:46,133
Take it.

572
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:50,573
Gosh, my arm is getting tired.

573
00:47:54,212 --> 00:47:57,453
Why are you giving me something so precious to you?

574
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:01,323
Well, I'm sorry about earlier.

575
00:48:04,122 --> 00:48:06,692
Think of them as my payment for using your fan for a few minutes...

576
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:09,692
and a welcome gift from your senior colleague.

577
00:48:12,062 --> 00:48:14,502
Well, then. I'm off.

578
00:48:15,162 --> 00:48:16,232
Wait.

579
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,312
Was I too harsh on him earlier?

580
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:44,332
When you order food, you'll always have leftovers...

581
00:48:44,332 --> 00:48:46,763
because it's usually too much food for just one person.

582
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,803
I hope you're not suggesting eating together.

583
00:48:48,863 --> 00:48:49,863
Of course not.

584
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:52,232
Whenever you order food,

585
00:48:52,372 --> 00:48:54,803
you should give me half of it before you start eating.

586
00:48:54,803 --> 00:48:57,272
Then you won't have any food waste, so it'll benefit both of us.

587
00:49:13,423 --> 00:49:15,192
What is this?

588
00:49:18,232 --> 00:49:19,732
It's too much food for me,

589
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:21,962
so I thought I should share with you.

590
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:24,633
Well, I'm off.

591
00:49:24,772 --> 00:49:26,033
Wait, Ms. Kim.

592
00:49:26,933 --> 00:49:28,642
You don't need to thank me.

593
00:49:28,642 --> 00:49:30,712
I wanted to share it with you to thank you for the cherry tomatoes.

594
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:34,082
Well, it's not that. I just wanted to tell you...

595
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:35,642
that you should order fried rice with shrimp.

596
00:49:35,783 --> 00:49:38,653
I prefer it because of the deliciously chewy texture...

597
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:40,352
of shrimp.

598
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,683
- What? - The sweet and sour pork too.

599
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:45,192
I prefer to dip each piece in the sauce separately rather than...

600
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:47,562
Give it back, then.

601
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:49,392
Well, no.

602
00:49:49,493 --> 00:49:52,033
I'll eat it because I can't reject your kind gesture.

603
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:55,303
It's not really a kind gesture. I just did it as a formality.

604
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:58,303
Then I'll accept it as a formality as well.

605
00:49:58,673 --> 00:50:00,573
Actually, it wasn't even that. Just give it back.

606
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:02,542
No, I'm a guy with manners.

607
00:50:02,602 --> 00:50:05,812
And you know what? I prefer big tomatoes to cherry tomatoes.

608
00:50:05,812 --> 00:50:08,142
I have big tomatoes over there. I'll give you some next time.

609
00:50:08,142 --> 00:50:09,712
They're not even fully grown yet. Give this back!

610
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:11,053
I'm going to eat it all!

611
00:50:21,662 --> 00:50:22,923
(Serendipity brought us together, but maybe we were...)

612
00:50:22,923 --> 00:50:24,192
(meant to cross paths. Lee Sung Yeon)

613
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:29,363
I couldn't have gotten through it alone.

614
00:50:30,573 --> 00:50:34,073
I don't want to let go of the girl who stayed by my side back then.

615
00:50:35,142 --> 00:50:37,743
I will protect her with everything I have.

616
00:50:58,462 --> 00:51:01,303
(Kim Mi So)

617
00:51:13,412 --> 00:51:15,883
Mr. Lee isn't even calling me.

618
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:24,593
Who is it?

619
00:51:33,232 --> 00:51:34,333
Mr. Lee.

620
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,781
Mr. Lee.

621
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,260
Were you sleeping?

622
00:51:56,691 --> 00:51:58,600
It's too early to be in bed.

623
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:01,771
Well...

624
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,841
About today...

625
00:52:05,841 --> 00:52:07,271
- A package for you! - A package for you.

626
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:08,510
Sorry?

627
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:11,810
- You're Ms. Kim Mi So, right? - Yes, it's me. Thank you.

628
00:52:19,981 --> 00:52:21,091
(Dolsan Mustard Leaf Kimchi)

629
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:22,890
"Dolsan Mustard Leaf Kimchi"?

630
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,231
This always sells out on the home shopping channel.

631
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:28,731
It's really good.

632
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:37,571
- Then I want some too. - Pardon me?

633
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:39,001
Let's eat it together.

634
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:41,140
We can eat it with this.

635
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,370
What's in that bag?

636
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:44,281
Something that you like.

637
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,821
Well... Then you can come in if you want.

638
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,970
(Go Skin)

639
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,941
I'm a regular at this restaurant. You went all the way there?

640
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:15,171
Of course. I grilled them myself.

641
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,421
Excuse me. Could you pack this up for me?

642
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:38,901
Oh, right. The owner of the restaurant...

643
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,031
remembered the day we went there together.

644
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,600
I even got bugs on the house. Apparently, you like to eat them.

645
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:47,841
- "Bugs"? - Yes.

646
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,251
Oh, they're silkworm pupae.

647
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:01,850
Pig skin and insects.

648
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,260
My girlfriend has such peculiar taste.

649
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,490
Thank you.

650
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,060
Are you thanking me for getting things you like?

651
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,001
No, for coming here like this.

652
00:54:19,071 --> 00:54:20,341
I missed you.

653
00:54:28,781 --> 00:54:30,981
Why are you so rational at the office?

654
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,321
At the office, you are the Vice Chairman,

655
00:54:33,321 --> 00:54:35,990
and I am the secretary, so I was being more careful.

656
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,060
That's why I was trying to draw a line more.

657
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,631
Anyway, I am sorry for making you feel bad, Mr. Lee.

658
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,870
I don't like it.

659
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:55,640
My gosh, you are unbelievable.

660
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,740
I am apologizing.

661
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:00,040
Not that, I am talking about the way you call me.

662
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:02,010
Call me "Young Joon" from now on.

663
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:07,551
What?

664
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:13,021
Why don't we just stick to what we used to call each other?

665
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,430
You still call me Ms. Kim too.

666
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:19,060
I will call you by your name then. Mi So.

667
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:23,401
Say "Young Joon".

668
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,290
Young...

669
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,160
Young...

670
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:52,200
Young...

671
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,470
Young...

672
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:58,870
Maybe another time.

673
00:56:04,841 --> 00:56:07,910
Let's just take it slowly.

674
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:13,651
Mi So.

675
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:15,821
Mi So, your sisters are here. Open the door.

676
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:16,890
Your sisters?

677
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,361
- Open the door. - I should introduce myself to them.

678
00:56:19,361 --> 00:56:21,591
I want to let everybody know as soon as possible.

679
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,430
Wait.

680
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,660
Not now. Come with me.

681
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,631
- Why? They're calling you. - Mi So.

682
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:30,200
- Mi So. - Keep it down.

683
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,540
Ms. Kim, I need to say hi to your sisters.

684
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:39,941
Are you telling me to go in there?

685
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,211
Wait. Wait.

686
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:44,720
Ms. Kim.

687
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,981
I am Lee Young Joon, the Vice Chairman of Yumyung Group.

688
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:48,490
You are my boyfriend right now.

689
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,060
Stay right there.

690
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,060
Wait. Ms. Kim.

691
00:56:57,131 --> 00:56:58,631
Please keep it down.

692
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,551
What? You were in.

693
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:18,080
Why didn't you open the door?

694
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,620
I dozed off.

695
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,551
By the way, what brings you here?

696
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:26,260
Well, you didn't sound well earlier.

697
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,990
We made a surprise visit to make you feel better.

698
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:33,870
Ta-da.

699
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:36,071
This is...

700
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,801
grilled pork skin from Go Skin!

701
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:44,540
It's going to be... You are already eating it.

702
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,981
Oh, I suddenly had the urge.

703
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:51,720
Why are there two sets?

704
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,620
Right. You wouldn't have used both your hands.

705
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,421
- Well, that's... - Did you...

706
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:01,361
let that Vice Chairman into your flat again?

707
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:06,600
Well, he just ate it and left right away.

708
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:10,841
He's a rich man. Does he have nowhere else to go?

709
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:13,001
He made you cook ramen for him when he was here last time.

710
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:14,341
Did he?

711
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:17,841
You treated him noodles last time and grilled pork skin today?

712
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,881
My gosh, why is he so petty?

713
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:23,080
- That's... - I didn't treat him today.

714
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:24,421
He bought it himself.

715
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,321
That's terrible.

716
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:29,051
He bought you pork skin, not rib-eye.

717
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:32,091
My gosh, why is the rich man so petty?

718
00:58:33,691 --> 00:58:36,560
Mi So, you can't be with him.

719
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,131
I told you.

720
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:41,131
He's a different breed.

721
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:42,271
Yes.

722
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,370
Even if you like each other, his family will be against it.

723
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:47,071
What if his mother hands you an envelope with money...

724
00:58:47,071 --> 00:58:48,771
and says, "Get away from my son,"

725
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:51,841
and splashes water onto your face?

726
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:55,510
My gosh, you've watched too much TV.

727
00:58:55,711 --> 00:58:58,881
And even if his family allows it, I can't allow it.

728
00:58:59,021 --> 00:59:00,790
From what you've told us,

729
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:03,720
he's narcissistic and selfish.

730
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:07,430
When did I say that?

731
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:08,930
More than anything,

732
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,231
you said he can't even kiss...

733
00:59:10,231 --> 00:59:11,560
because he's suffering from a sexual dysfunction.

734
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,131
If he's got so much time to kill,

735
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:16,301
tell him to visit our urology clinic.

736
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,970
Let's talk more while drinking.

737
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,370
Bring that.

738
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,551
My gosh.

739
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:30,921
Come on and eat, Mi So.

740
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:31,981
It's delicious.

741
00:59:31,981 --> 00:59:34,421
- Cheers. - Cheers, Mi So.

742
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,151
What is it?

743
00:59:36,151 --> 00:59:38,691
We want to get one more drink. Why are you making us leave?

744
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:41,430
Just one can more.

745
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:43,591
- Next time. - Oh, come on.

746
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,361
Let's go.

747
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:50,941
- Hey. - Bye.

748
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:05,220
Mr. Lee.

749
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,801
Ms. Kim.

750
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:23,700
How did you brief them about me?

751
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:26,370
That's not it.

752
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:29,841
You didn't mention any of the things I did of a blockbuster scale.

753
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:31,740
Did you only tell them about the time I ate ramen here?

754
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,481
And did you say I am selfish?

755
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:41,191
If I was, I wouldn't have bought pork skin and insects, would I?

756
01:00:42,191 --> 01:00:43,251
I am sorry.

757
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:46,990
I understand that you would be upset.

758
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:54,100
Let's stop it.

759
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:08,180
We might get into another fight.

760
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:10,580
We just reconciled.

761
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,660
And you look so pretty...

762
01:01:26,222 --> 01:01:27,892
that I can't be upset any longer.

763
01:02:21,263 --> 01:02:24,403
I acted so rashly that day...

764
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:27,073
and put you in an awkward position. I feel bad about it.

765
01:02:28,004 --> 01:02:31,144
I will go to the office later. Let's talk for a while.

766
01:02:38,153 --> 01:02:40,184
Good morning, Ms. Kim.

767
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:44,954
Wait.

768
01:02:49,263 --> 01:02:51,794
Can I go see him briefly?

769
01:02:55,863 --> 01:02:58,604
I want to clearly tell him how I feel and end it.

770
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:02,704
Do that.

771
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:32,274
Have you been well?

772
01:03:33,474 --> 01:03:34,644
Yes. Well...

773
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:37,474
You've been avoiding my call for days,

774
01:03:37,474 --> 01:03:38,814
and I've been feeling bad.

775
01:03:39,644 --> 01:03:41,144
Thank you for coming.

776
01:03:41,713 --> 01:03:43,484
It's nice to see you.

777
01:03:49,724 --> 01:03:50,754
I am sorry...

778
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:54,064
that I suddenly professed my feelings that day.

779
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:57,193
I just wanted to express my sincere feelings.

780
01:03:57,863 --> 01:03:59,734
It surprised you, didn't it?

781
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,004
It did.

782
01:04:02,734 --> 01:04:05,303
I didn't meet you with such intention.

783
01:04:09,803 --> 01:04:11,213
When I was a young girl, you protected me...

784
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:13,274
in a tough situation, and I was thankful to you for it.

785
01:04:14,113 --> 01:04:15,984
I really wanted to find you one day.

786
01:04:17,283 --> 01:04:18,314
But...

787
01:04:19,113 --> 01:04:21,024
I didn't have any other feelings for you.

788
01:04:23,423 --> 01:04:24,493
That's why...

789
01:04:25,454 --> 01:04:26,624
I can't...

790
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,323
accept your feelings.

791
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:32,863
Is it...

792
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:35,533
because of Young Joon?

793
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:39,573
Yes.

794
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:41,173
Do you know...

795
01:04:42,073 --> 01:04:44,814
how tough it's been for me all these days because of him?

796
01:04:45,144 --> 01:04:47,213
I was in pain because of him,

797
01:04:47,213 --> 01:04:48,484
then I gave up everything and went away to abroad.

798
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:49,883
Do you know how I felt?

799
01:04:50,883 --> 01:04:52,013
Is it that story again?

800
01:05:00,124 --> 01:05:01,993
Until when will you talk about that story?

801
01:05:02,323 --> 01:05:03,463
Aren't you tired of it yet?

802
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:05,064
Tired of it?

803
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:06,863
How can you say that?

804
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,374
I still clearly remember that incident.

805
01:05:11,104 --> 01:05:13,274
That's why I still live in pain.

806
01:05:13,803 --> 01:05:16,274
But you feel fine, don't you?

807
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:18,713
You erased all the memories that are unfavorable to you.

808
01:05:20,713 --> 01:05:21,883
Don't get ahead of yourself.

809
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:24,783
Don't call Mi So again and talk nonsense to her.

810
01:05:25,383 --> 01:05:27,754
If you talk to her like this ever again,

811
01:05:29,184 --> 01:05:31,454
I won't let it slide even if we are family.

812
01:05:39,193 --> 01:05:40,334
Let's go.

813
01:05:55,883 --> 01:05:57,414
Mr. Lee.

814
01:06:01,184 --> 01:06:03,524
He's struggling so much.

815
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,823
Aren't you sorry to him?

816
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:09,463
The past he's obsessed about...

817
01:06:09,894 --> 01:06:11,294
doesn't exist in my memory at all.

818
01:06:11,993 --> 01:06:14,064
Feeling sorry for something you don't remember...

819
01:06:14,434 --> 01:06:15,664
is just being hypocritical, isn't it?

820
01:06:23,444 --> 01:06:26,713
I hope we won't talk about that time ever again.

821
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,184
Okay. We won't.

822
01:06:36,953 --> 01:06:38,394
Where are we going?

823
01:06:39,654 --> 01:06:40,724
We are going for a drive.

824
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:43,734
I will be your secretary today.

825
01:06:49,663 --> 01:06:51,104
You are prettier when you smile.

826
01:06:54,003 --> 01:06:55,474
Is there somewhere you would like to go?

827
01:06:56,703 --> 01:06:57,843
I don't know.

828
01:06:58,173 --> 01:07:00,444
I want to go for a little walk.

829
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:13,553
It's lovely.

830
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:19,194
Are you cold?

831
01:07:19,934 --> 01:07:21,003
A little bit.

832
01:07:21,463 --> 01:07:24,133
I think it's because we're by the river, so I'm a little chilly.

833
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:25,873
Wait here.

834
01:07:41,354 --> 01:07:42,524
Put this on.

835
01:07:43,824 --> 01:07:44,923
Thank you.

836
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:47,263
It's burgundy.

837
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:50,694
Burgundy looks really good on you I think.

838
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:53,463
You are wrong.

839
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:55,503
I look good in any colors.

840
01:07:55,503 --> 01:07:57,303
But burgundy looks exceptionally good on me.

841
01:07:59,474 --> 01:08:00,474
Right.

842
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:02,744
I didn't think of that.

843
01:08:02,744 --> 01:08:05,843
The designer who used to really adore me said it himself.

844
01:08:06,274 --> 01:08:07,484
Who was he?

845
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:08,614
Someone I know?

846
01:08:08,614 --> 01:08:11,614
No. He's my mother's acquaintance, so you wouldn't know him.

847
01:08:12,553 --> 01:08:14,824
He adored me since I was a baby,

848
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,324
so he used to make clothes for me.

849
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:18,953
He made them for you?

850
01:08:18,953 --> 01:08:21,894
Yes. He didn't even make them for his own nephews and nieces.

851
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:23,894
But he made it specially for me.

852
01:08:26,633 --> 01:08:29,604
Fashion designer Jang Jung Do...

853
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:32,074
made that cardigan just for him.

854
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:34,604
He's my boy, but he looked so good in it.

855
01:08:34,774 --> 01:08:35,843
That day when he was...

856
01:08:36,474 --> 01:08:40,013
leaving in that cardigan, he looked so lovely.

857
01:08:52,724 --> 01:08:53,864
Don't be mistaken.

858
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,394
I am not yawning because it's boring to be with you.

859
01:08:56,793 --> 01:08:58,064
It's just that I feel comfortable.

860
01:09:00,934 --> 01:09:02,833
Perhaps because I am relaxed...

861
01:09:03,203 --> 01:09:04,474
and just can't get enough sleep.

862
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:07,873
Do you want to rest a little bit in the car?

863
01:09:15,013 --> 01:09:16,644
It's bad to do this during a date...

864
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:19,354
Should we take a short rest then?

865
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:21,984
Let's go.

866
01:09:47,814 --> 01:09:49,484
It was a chilly day when he left home.

867
01:09:49,843 --> 01:09:51,583
He usually gets cold easily.

868
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:53,383
What if I get cold?

869
01:09:53,724 --> 01:09:55,784
- I will be fine. - I was talking about me.

870
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:57,593
I meant what should I do if I catch a cold.

871
01:09:59,123 --> 01:10:00,324
You get cold easily, don't you?

872
01:10:00,793 --> 01:10:02,864
I will never forget your name.

873
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:04,833
Your name is Lee...

874
01:10:05,263 --> 01:10:06,963
- Lee... - Idiot.

875
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:08,364
You did it again.

876
01:10:08,633 --> 01:10:10,263
That's not my name.

877
01:10:10,503 --> 01:10:12,803
- It's Lee Sung... - How did...

878
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:15,074
How did my Hyun look?

879
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:18,713
Right.

880
01:10:19,373 --> 01:10:21,614
She clearly called him "Hyun".

881
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:27,053
Young children often make cognitive errors.

882
01:10:27,553 --> 01:10:31,623
What if I mistook it for something with a similar pronunciation?

883
01:10:44,803 --> 01:10:46,003
Sung Hyun?

884
01:10:50,843 --> 01:10:51,873
What?

885
01:11:21,774 --> 01:11:24,343
(Thank you Chung Su Young and Mihal Ashminov.)

886
01:11:46,133 --> 01:11:48,463
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

887
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:52,574
I hope you won't worry about our relationship anymore.

888
01:11:52,633 --> 01:11:55,244
When you meet her family, put your hands together.

889
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,574
"Yes. Yes. I love it."

890
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:59,074
I did everything they told me to do.

891
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:01,644
Clams.

892
01:12:02,413 --> 01:12:04,453
You've heard the saying, "Rich people are pettier."

893
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:05,513
That's me.

894
01:12:05,513 --> 01:12:06,854
This is nicely filled with crab roe.

895
01:12:06,854 --> 01:12:09,883
Between these two, who are you?

896
