1
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:14,167
Why are you smiling?

2
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:19,438
I thought it was going to be uncomfortable...

3
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:21,508
when all the truths come out.

4
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:23,677
It actually feels good.

5
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:27,918
I'm glad I told the truth.

6
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:29,877
Of course.

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,388
There's nothing better than being honest.

8
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,788
Do you really think so?

9
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,627
Then...

10
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:55,837
Can I honestly tell you how I feel right now?

11
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,007
I don't want to...

12
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:28,838
waste away this night.

13
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:42,117
(Park Yoo Shik)

14
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:03,837
Answer it. Perhaps it's an emergency.

15
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:05,967
(Park Yoo Shik)

16
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:08,578
If this isn't anything urgent...

17
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:11,207
I'm going to make him quit the company starting tomorrow.

18
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:18,147
What is it?

19
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:20,318
Hey, it's an emergency.

20
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:30,467
You know the new French brand...

21
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,897
that signed an exclusivity contract with us?

22
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:34,098
I think a UK company is targeting them too.

23
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:38,437
They already signed a contract with us, so how could that be?

24
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,378
What will happen...

25
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:41,777
if we make them take responsibility for the annulment of the contract,

26
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:43,978
and remove all of their items from our duty-free stores?

27
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:46,608
I was looking this over with the legal team,

28
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,647
but they said we could incur bigger damages...

29
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,617
since they're quite a big brand.

30
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,318
Email me a report of our projected losses.

31
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:53,658
And also send me a report...

32
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:56,658
regarding the profits they made from being sold in our duty-free stores,

33
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,728
compared to how much money they made through our competitors.

34
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:12,467
What's going on?

35
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,788
Goodness.

36
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:35,028
Wait a second.

37
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:39,598
Is it weird for me to be re-buttoning my top?

38
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,937
But it's weird to leave the buttons undone too.

39
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:58,788
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

40
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:00,757
Gosh!

41
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,827
(Earnings Report)

42
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:17,867
Yes, it's me. I don't know what kind of offer the UK company made them,

43
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:19,408
but we can't afford...

44
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,877
to pull all their items from our stores' shelves.

45
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:25,148
I think we'll have to meet with them again and renegotiate the contract,

46
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,418
because I think this is their ulterior motive in doing this.

47
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:31,387
We'll probably have to go to France then, right?

48
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,788
Yes, probably. Let's leave first thing tomorrow.

49
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:56,077
Wait a second. If I go to Paris tomorrow...

50
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:58,778
I won't be able to see Ms. Kim for at least a week.

51
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:02,278
I need to make the most of tonight.

52
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:23,168
She should've gotten drunk off the atmosphere...

53
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,668
but she got drunk on the alcohol and fell asleep?

54
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:58,437
I have to go on a business trip tomorrow. What a shame.

55
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:07,247
When I leave the country tomorrow...

56
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:10,418
we won't be able to see each other for at least a week.

57
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:22,827
If we don't make the most of tonight...

58
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:25,598
you'll surely regret it.

59
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:57,468
She must have been very tired.

60
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,437
Okay...

61
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:15,437
Just how long will I have to stick to kissing just your forehead?

62
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:25,918
At this rate, I'll become a forehead-kissing expert.

63
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,148
Why am I here?

64
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,597
Did I pass out after drinking and fell asleep here?

65
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:11,798
Are you up?

66
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:13,998
Goodness.

67
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,768
You're up already?

68
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:19,837
Did you sleep well?

69
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:24,548
No, I did not sleep well...

70
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,748
because you fell asleep first.

71
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:33,658
By the way, what happened yesterday?

72
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:35,418
You were on the phone for quite a while.

73
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:39,488
I have to go on a business trip.

74
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:41,498
A business trip?

75
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:59,177
You can wear this. And I've packed your bag for you already.

76
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,618
You don't have much time left before your flight, so you need to hurry.

77
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,317
We won't see each other for at least a week after I leave today.

78
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:08,888
So I want to hug you for even just a second longer.

79
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:13,898
Should I take you with me?

80
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:17,498
I wish I could put you in my suitcase.

81
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,437
You're going to fly first class, yet make me fly in your suitcase?

82
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:31,408
I really want to go with you too,

83
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,548
but I have a lot of work to take care of in your absence.

84
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:35,518
Is that how it is?

85
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:49,597
Nice.

86
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:52,368
You may look at this photo whenever you miss me.

87
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:54,967
Thank you, sir.

88
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,337
Smile, Ms. Kim.

89
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:07,118
And I can look at this.

90
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,018
You may look at that all you want whenever you miss me too, Mr. Lee.

91
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,317
- What an honor. Thank you kindly. - Sure.

92
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,357
Come over here.

93
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,567
Be sure to contact me often.

94
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:28,638
I'll punish you if you don't.

95
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:31,638
And how will you punish me, exactly?

96
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:52,628
Like this?

97
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:05,268
(To Mi So, I'm on my way to the airport.)

98
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,878
(Message from Vice Chairman)

99
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:17,618
I'm on my way to the airport.

100
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:19,648
I miss you already.

101
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:05,327
How cute.

102
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:08,668
Thank you, sir.

103
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,368
I may have a big build, but I hear that I'm cute often.

104
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,207
I see, congratulations.

105
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:48,307
Hello, sir.

106
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:54,378
Did I just wake you up?

107
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:56,888
No, I wasn't sleeping.

108
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:00,817
Did you have a good day today?

109
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:03,827
Yes, I've thought about you 100 times.

110
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:08,197
That's a shame because I did it 101 times.

111
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:10,268
You should try harder next time.

112
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:13,368
Okay.

113
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,697
I'm envious.

114
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:18,768
Of what?

115
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:21,738
I'm envious of Hardworking Cow for lying next to you.

116
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:23,707
I should be lying there instead.

117
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,508
What an ungrateful cow.

118
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:27,378
Goodness.

119
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:31,018
I left your place empty.

120
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,977
I prepared things as if I was with you.

121
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,467
Once the brand launches in Yumyung Group...

122
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:20,798
We need a new business strategy...

123
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:23,138
because last year's result was below expectation.

124
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:27,077
Our goal is to increase the amount by more than 10 percent...

125
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:29,677
- compared to last year. - That's right.

126
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:40,217
Okay, we'll do everything for you.

127
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:42,288
- Good. - Good?

128
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,347
(Vice Chairman)

129
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:06,448
Moving on to the next page.

130
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,718
The person you're dialing isn't available at the moment.

131
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,218
I want to hear her voice.

132
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,708
I miss him.

133
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,417
Hello.

134
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:46,718
I'm Ko Gui Nam, and I'll be working with you as of today.

135
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:54,057
You have to know that there were so many applicants...

136
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,627
who wanted to transfer to our team.

137
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:58,097
But to make you come,

138
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:00,798
I, the practical power of this team,

139
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:05,407
used my influence, you know that?

140
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:08,077
Yes, I'll work hard.

141
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:10,307
I don't need anything big.

142
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,907
I just want to be like the seasoning salt of ox bone soup.

143
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:15,518
I may not stand out like the main ingredients,

144
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:19,248
but I'd like to be the person who does his job.

145
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,317
I love that mindset.

146
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:33,867
By the way, I heard that you were appointed to our team,

147
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,008
but I didn't know that you'd come this soon.

148
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:39,008
He was going to come anyway, so it'd be better...

149
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,877
if he got used to his new work.

150
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:45,678
The vice chairman decided on this matter.

151
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:49,877
Oh, right. When is he coming back?

152
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,387
After two days.

153
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:55,887
Oh, man. It was great working without him.

154
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,988
The good days are all gone.

155
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:00,057
Tell me about it.

156
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:03,597
I wish his flight gets delayed just for a day.

157
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:07,167
I wish he takes as much time as he can.

158
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:09,038
Goodness.

159
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:17,008
Let's begin work.

160
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:26,817
It smells good.

161
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:32,587
That coffee smells amazing.

162
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,657
Let's go work.

163
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:37,468
Goodness, he's coming too soon.

164
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:39,698
We're doomed.

165
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:42,938
Gosh, my hand hurts.

166
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:50,807
Go with me, Young Joon.

167
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,548
You're walking so fast with those long legs of yours.

168
00:19:54,147 --> 00:19:55,817
I need to go quickly to see Ms. Kim.

169
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:02,018
Oh, is that right? I see.

170
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:06,228
You made your schedule so tight to advance the flight back home.

171
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:10,028
And now, you're walking incredibly fast so that you can see her sooner.

172
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,698
No, it's because I want to part ways with you soon.

173
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:14,667
You think I was happy?

174
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:17,208
I was very happy.

175
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,837
Anyway, Ms. Kim must've waited so much.

176
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:23,948
Imagine how much she misses you.

177
00:20:24,577 --> 00:20:25,678
Of course.

178
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:28,877
She couldn't see this addictive face for almost a week.

179
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:32,948
I feel like it's too harsh of a punishment on her.

180
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:39,188
But she's not here to see you.

181
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:41,028
She doesn't know that I'm arriving early.

182
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,597
I didn't tell her to surprise her.

183
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:46,998
I can imagine her bright smile...

184
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:48,698
to see my face unexpectedly.

185
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,048
You're done organizing data already?

186
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:04,587
Yes, because both my hobby and specialty are working.

187
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:10,827
Is the AC in turbo mode or something in here?

188
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:12,788
Why am I having chills?

189
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:19,567
Sir.

190
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,377
I thought you were arriving on the 20th. What happened?

191
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:32,307
Hello, I've been transferred to this team from the planning team.

192
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:34,317
- I'm aware. - I see.

193
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:35,778
- I'm the intern... - I know.

194
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:38,188
Are you Bae Hyun Seung?

195
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:40,417
I'm counting on you.

196
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:42,188
I'll work hard.

197
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:44,357
I don't need anything big.

198
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:47,298
I just want to be like the seasoning salt of ox bone soup.

199
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,857
I may not stand out like the main ingredients,

200
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:53,367
but I'd like to be the person who does his job.

201
00:21:55,468 --> 00:21:59,038
Ox bone soup is all about meat and salt, but you want to be the salt?

202
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:00,407
I think that's a bit too greedy of you.

203
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:05,778
- Well... - I'll look forward to...

204
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:07,178
your salt-like outcomes.

205
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:09,748
- See me for a second, Ms. Kim. - Yes, sir.

206
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:16,887
Salt.

207
00:22:20,228 --> 00:22:21,458
What happened?

208
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:24,528
I would've gone out to see you at the airport if you had called me.

209
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:25,768
Don't smile.

210
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:27,968
Don't show...

211
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:31,067
your pretty smile to other men.

212
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:36,508
I even skipped my meals for work just to see you as soon as possible.

213
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:38,077
I flew for 12 hours,

214
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,417
thinking you'd smile brightly when you saw me unexpectedly.

215
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:43,788
But you were giving that bright smile...

216
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:45,847
to that salt and chick intern.

217
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,258
I'm very upset.

218
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,637
Stop it. We're in the office.

219
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:04,468
If the office is uncomfortable, let's leave work right now.

220
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,938
That's not what I mean.

221
00:23:09,837 --> 00:23:11,077
I missed you.

222
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:17,718
Let's stick to each other as much as we've been away.

223
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:29,657
Where are you going?

224
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:45,008
The weather is nice.

225
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:52,387
You've been away for five days, so you have a lot of work to get done.

226
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:55,387
I don't know if it's okay for us to be outside like this.

227
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:57,188
Ms. Kim.

228
00:23:57,488 --> 00:24:01,397
When I was a student, I never skipped classes even once.

229
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:05,067
I was that diligent,

230
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:07,667
but I'm skipping my work for the first time in my life...

231
00:24:08,337 --> 00:24:09,798
because I want to spend time with you.

232
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:18,407
Looking at couples walking on the street of Paris, I thought...

233
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:21,147
that I should come back to Korea soon...

234
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:24,048
so that I could go on a date with Mi So.

235
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:29,218
I held out with that thought, so let me off just for today.

236
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,887
Then it's just for today...

237
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:35,728
because I missed you very much too.

238
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:03,018
Sung Hyun.

239
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,028
Sung Hyun.

240
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,627
Come quickly, Sung Hyun.

241
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:13,837
Say hello to your new English tutor.

242
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:15,597
Hello.

243
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:19,067
As I told you before, he's learning faster than his peers.

244
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:20,738
Please take extra care of him.

245
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:23,008
Is he that smart?

246
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:25,248
Wait here then.

247
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:26,877
I'll go get something to drink.

248
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:28,218
I want to go too.

249
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:30,587
Why? Are you afraid to be alone?

250
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:32,188
I said I'm not.

251
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,617
- Go then. - You have to stay here.

252
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,387
Don't get lost.

253
00:25:40,057 --> 00:25:41,327
Come back quickly.

254
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,528
Was Sung Hyun...

255
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:50,238
really locked up in here?

256
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,107
Because...

257
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:55,238
I abandoned him there?

258
00:25:55,778 --> 00:25:57,048
Because of me?

259
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,018
What are you thinking deeply about?

260
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:16,198
I was thinking about my childhood.

261
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:18,968
When Young Joon...

262
00:26:20,137 --> 00:26:21,337
and I were young.

263
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:26,337
You know, I shouldn't run away again.

264
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:28,907
Sung Yeon.

265
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:32,107
I realized after thinking back...

266
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:34,877
that I never...

267
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:39,587
hated him with my heart even once.

268
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:41,718
It was...

269
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,188
my insufficient self which I hated.

270
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:47,897
I was envious of Young Joon for being perfect in every way.

271
00:26:49,228 --> 00:26:51,268
I always wanted to be like him.

272
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:59,307
I'm sorry, Sung Yeon,

273
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,708
for being indifferent towards you.

274
00:27:05,178 --> 00:27:07,948
If we hurt your feelings in any way,

275
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:11,018
it may be too late,

276
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:15,788
but can you forgive us?

277
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:18,988
Right,

278
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:22,827
we unintentionally compared you with Young Joon.

279
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:25,698
We're very sorry about that.

280
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:29,198
We're sorry...

281
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:33,137
that we couldn't...

282
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,807
understand your feelings better.

283
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:38,278
We really are.

284
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:43,417
It won't be too late...

285
00:27:45,147 --> 00:27:46,857
to make another path, right?

286
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:09,907
- Goodness. - Nothing special happened, right?

287
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:12,577
Something incredibly special happened.

288
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:14,077
What was it about?

289
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:19,117
Should I tell you this or not?

290
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:21,417
What is it? You're making me curious.

291
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,557
Well...

292
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:28,127
The vice chairman has a girlfriend.

293
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:29,157
What?

294
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:31,827
He's coming back from meeting his girlfriend now.

295
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:33,897
Check this out.

296
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,407
Who took this photo?

297
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:40,978
My friend from college.

298
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:43,407
She knows the vice chairman's face because she works as an intern here.

299
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:46,877
She said she saw him kiss the back of his girlfriend's hand like this.

300
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:49,518
Is this all? What about the girl's picture?

301
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:51,617
Unfortunately, this is all.

302
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:53,288
It's unbelievable.

303
00:28:53,587 --> 00:28:55,788
He told me not to make any appointments today,

304
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,258
so I thought maybe he was very tired.

305
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:01,298
I had no idea he'd go straight to see his girlfriend.

306
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,198
He's edgy to us,

307
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:06,837
but I guess he's so sweet to his girlfriend.

308
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,538
I guess so.

309
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:14,178
Didn't you know? You went outside with him.

310
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:19,748
I was waiting for him in the car. I didn't know whom he was meeting.

311
00:29:23,748 --> 00:29:24,847
Here.

312
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:26,317
Thank you.

313
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:29,587
I enjoyed our skipping work.

314
00:29:30,258 --> 00:29:34,228
Isn't that message from the vice chairman?

315
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:35,498
What?

316
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:39,397
I think I read "Vice Chairman" on the screen.

317
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:41,097
Why did he put a heart emoji at the end?

318
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:47,807
No way. Don't tell me you're his girlfriend.

319
00:29:51,307 --> 00:29:54,417
There are many other vice chairmans in our country.

320
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:57,147
He's the vice chairman of the youth group in my church.

321
00:29:57,188 --> 00:30:00,458
He's always full of love that he often sends me heart emojis.

322
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:01,988
Amen.

323
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:05,258
Goodness.

324
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:07,498
Gosh.

325
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:09,298
Silly me.

326
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:33,248
That was close, but I managed to let off the hook.

327
00:30:34,157 --> 00:30:35,718
That was very natural.

328
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:38,988
Ms. Kim.

329
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:42,057
By any chance,

330
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:45,028
if I talked ill about the vice chairman,

331
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:47,337
please forgive me.

332
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:50,807
Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?

333
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,678
No one'd feel great to hear someone badmouth her boyfriend.

334
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:55,407
Excuse me?

335
00:30:56,508 --> 00:30:58,278
You two are going out.

336
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:02,018
The girl who gets kissed on the back of her hand in the picture...

337
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:03,587
It's you, right?

338
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:07,958
No. It's really not me.

339
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:13,127
I really hate myself for being quick-witted at times like this.

340
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:19,968
This bracelet...

341
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:23,268
is the same as the one you're wearing right now.

342
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,508
Gosh, that's nothing.

343
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:29,708
This bracelet went popular last year.

344
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,048
Ms. Bong has the same one too.

345
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,048
- Does she not? - Ms. Kim.

346
00:31:35,178 --> 00:31:38,788
Just admit to it. I told you I'm quick-witted.

347
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:48,657
Do you admit to it now?

348
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:51,897
I know you're going out with the vice chairman.

349
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:55,238
That's right. We're going out, but please keep it a secret.

350
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:57,367
Just keep it to yourself, please.

351
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:00,837
Sure thing.

352
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:05,278
I'm not only quick-witted but also loyal, so don't worry a thing.

353
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,448
I'm supporting your love.

354
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:09,778
Thanks.

355
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:12,518
Congratulations

356
00:32:12,518 --> 00:32:14,587
Okay, enough.

357
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:16,587
- Congratulations - Okay, thanks.

358
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,978
Did he just smile at you?

359
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:40,478
You two are so sweet and lovely.

360
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:48,958
Aren't you going to go?

361
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:51,458
Your boyfriend is calling for you.

362
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:54,228
Goodness, don't say that.

363
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,097
This bell didn't sound so special before,

364
00:32:58,097 --> 00:33:01,067
but now that I know about your relationship, it sounds romantic.

365
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,508
- It's the love signal. - It's the work signal.

366
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:07,137
Let's calm down now, and get back to work, Ji Ah.

367
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:09,008
Okay.

368
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:15,248
But I can't calm down because I'm so curious.

369
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:16,988
When did the two of you start dating?

370
00:33:17,188 --> 00:33:19,288
Is he good to you? Does he call you by a nickname?

371
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,788
He probably doesn't call you Ms. Kim. Mi So? My dear Mi So?

372
00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:23,157
Baby? Darling? Honey?

373
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:24,357
My goodness.

374
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:34,498
Did you need me, sir?

375
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:39,738
Why did you close the blinds?

376
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:42,208
We should sit side by side and work together.

377
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:43,907
Have a seat here.

378
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:48,417
No, I can't. Ji Ah will think strangely of it.

379
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:56,557
She's found out about our relationship.

380
00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:59,988
Really? So what?

381
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:02,028
What do you mean?

382
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,597
Well, I'm sure she won't tell anyone,

383
00:34:05,597 --> 00:34:08,038
but everyone will find out about us in no time at this rate.

384
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:09,937
I prefer to make it public.

385
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,238
Then things will become a lot more comfortable.

386
00:34:13,107 --> 00:34:15,278
And those jerks, who are like salt in ox bone soup,

387
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:16,638
won't be able to hit on you anymore.

388
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:19,147
No one is trying to hit on me.

389
00:34:19,477 --> 00:34:21,078
Anyway, we cannot make it public.

390
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:25,287
We shouldn't show our affection at work or anywhere around the office.

391
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,457
I can't make it public, and you won't even let me touch you.

392
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,868
Why can't I do anything that I want to do?

393
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,138
Relationship is all about compromise.

394
00:34:40,138 --> 00:34:41,968
Why are you demanding me to follow your way?

395
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:43,968
- That's not what I meant. - I'm dying...

396
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,138
to tell the whole world that you're mine.

397
00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:49,437
I'm upset because it seems like you want to hide me.

398
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:52,548
I don't want to hide you. I'm just trying to protect you.

399
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:54,848
But why?

400
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,988
Because you're not like us regular people.

401
00:34:57,988 --> 00:35:00,817
I can't help but be cautious because of your power...

402
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:02,917
and social influence.

403
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:05,758
Whatever.

404
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:08,997
I will try my best to let you have your way with this,

405
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,598
but I don't know when my patience...

406
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:13,437
will run out.

407
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:23,461

408
00:35:29,178 --> 00:35:32,317
Mr. Lee will be busy for the next little while, right?

409
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:37,227
Yes, he'll be swamped with all the work that's piled up.

410
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:40,758
It'll be so exhausting.

411
00:35:42,198 --> 00:35:44,828
By the way, why are you worried about Mr. Lee all of a sudden?

412
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:49,298
If you have a crush on him, you'll be heartbroken...

413
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:55,808
- What? What did you just say? - Nothing. Never mind.

414
00:35:57,508 --> 00:35:59,908
- Oh, well. Have a good day, then. - You too.

415
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:06,517
I need to make a photocopy of this.

416
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:27,008
Well, Ji Ah.

417
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:30,707
Have you finished the sales report for Yumyung Electronics?

418
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:33,107
No, not yet.

419
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:35,848
Because of Mr. Lee's business trip,

420
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:38,017
I've had additional things to take care of.

421
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:39,888
I'll be sure to finish it by the end of the week.

422
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,118
All right.

423
00:36:44,687 --> 00:36:47,028
Oh, my. It's already time to call it a day.

424
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:48,457
Already?

425
00:36:49,428 --> 00:36:50,468
Mr. Ko.

426
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:53,897
Since we need to throw a welcome party for you anyway,

427
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:55,698
how about we go out for drinks?

428
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:59,167
No, it's okay. What's welcoming me is...

429
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,037
the work that's piled up here, not drinking.

430
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:04,877
I'll throw my own welcome party tonight with all this work.

431
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:08,517
Have a good evening.

432
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:15,158
I heard that he's a workaholic,

433
00:37:15,158 --> 00:37:16,988
but actually seeing it, is really impressive.

434
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:18,928
- I know, right? - Impressive, my foot.

435
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:22,457
All right, then. Even without the man of the hour,

436
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:25,828
we should go out for drinks to welcome Mr. Ko to the team.

437
00:37:26,598 --> 00:37:28,437
What do you all say? Are you all in?

438
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,707
- Bye. - See you tomorrow!

439
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:31,808
- Good work today. - You?

440
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:36,908
Ms. Kim asked me to find something. What was it?

441
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:50,957
You'll come to my place with me today, right?

442
00:37:52,127 --> 00:37:53,497
Your place?

443
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:59,397
I don't have nightmares anymore, so I can sleep alone now.

444
00:37:59,397 --> 00:38:02,537
I no longer have to sleep at your place.

445
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:04,667
Well, I mean...

446
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:08,638
there's something we still have to do.

447
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:10,908
Something we have to do?

448
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,178
What we couldn't finish that day.

449
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,817
What we couldn't finish...

450
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:30,267
We're on our way home now. How can you talk about that so explicitly?

451
00:38:33,298 --> 00:38:36,397
What is wrong with "something we couldn't finish"?

452
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:38,868
I can make it sound even sexier.

453
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,037
A hot, steamy night.

454
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:43,408
A passionate night.

455
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:46,508
- An erotic night. - Enough, please.

456
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:52,247
And the sexiest of them all is...

457
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:55,718
the fact that I love you.

458
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,127
I love you.

459
00:39:27,058 --> 00:39:29,658
I'm totally out of ramen,

460
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:32,227
and I don't really want to eat alone today.

461
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:38,868
Didn't you say you were working late today?

462
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:43,908
I lied because I was worried I might have to pay for everyone's drinks.

463
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,408
That would be such an unnecessary expense.

464
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:51,678
Then would you be up for an welcome party with just me?

465
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:54,548
Sorry?

466
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:59,417
I'm still grateful for your help with restoring my meeting minutes.

467
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:03,087
I also want to throw you a welcome party as your neighbor.

468
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:04,888
I'll buy you a drink.

469
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:07,698
It's all right.

470
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:10,127
If you buy me a drink, I'll have to buy you one too.

471
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:12,198
I want to avoid getting myself into such a vicious cycle.

472
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:17,837
Just come with me, will you? You talk too much.

473
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:18,968
Ms. Kim, where...

474
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:21,508
- Wait, where are you taking me? - I'll throw you a welcome party.

475
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:22,578
Let go of me first. Let go.

476
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:33,488
We'll be there in about five minutes.

477
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:40,028
Excuse me for a moment.

478
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:42,997
Hi, Dad.

479
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:46,837
What did you just say?

480
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:52,337
I said I'm okay.

481
00:40:52,508 --> 00:40:54,037
I'm really fine.

482
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:56,747
A rocker does not need to be hospitalized.

483
00:40:57,107 --> 00:40:58,308
Dad, please.

484
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:03,078
He won't have to stay for too long.

485
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:06,348
It's just a mild tendon injury, so he'll recover in a few days.

486
00:41:06,587 --> 00:41:07,888
Thank you, Doctor Choi.

487
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,857
Then please say hello to Mr. Lee for me.

488
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:11,857
No problem.

489
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,437
How did you end up hurting yourself?

490
00:41:25,837 --> 00:41:26,877
It's...

491
00:41:26,877 --> 00:41:28,377
All right. Next up...

492
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:31,377
is the amazing band from Yeongdeungpo, Phoenix.

493
00:41:31,377 --> 00:41:33,718
Give it up for their title track, "Is This Dog Crazy".

494
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:42,558
This dog must be crazy

495
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:45,687
We must be crazy too

496
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:48,627
This dog must be crazy

497
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:53,497
We must be crazy too

498
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:11,888
Hey, are you okay?

499
00:42:20,798 --> 00:42:23,158
I tried to dive into the audience and ruined the performance.

500
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:25,397
I totally forgot the fact that the average age is 50.

501
00:42:27,198 --> 00:42:30,138
People in their 50s don't want to do anything bad for their health.

502
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:32,267
You need to worry about your health too, Dad.

503
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:42,578
Is your dad okay?

504
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,448
Yes, it's just a mild tendon injury.

505
00:42:44,448 --> 00:42:46,517
The doctor said he'll recover in a few days.

506
00:42:46,888 --> 00:42:47,917
That's a relief.

507
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:50,928
But it looks like I have to stay here all night.

508
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:52,988
All night?

509
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:58,997
Then shall I stay here with you? I can meet your dad too.

510
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,767
No, it's okay. This isn't a good time as he's quite flustered.

511
00:43:04,508 --> 00:43:05,508
All right, then.

512
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:10,678
Besides, you must be tired from your 12-hour flight.

513
00:43:10,977 --> 00:43:12,377
You should go home and get some rest.

514
00:43:15,448 --> 00:43:17,348
Okay, I will. I have no choice.

515
00:43:30,627 --> 00:43:33,328
I didn't think I'd end up sleeping here alone tonight.

516
00:43:33,638 --> 00:43:36,198
This is definitely not why I got through the crazy schedule in Paris.

517
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:38,767
My, that's right.

518
00:43:38,837 --> 00:43:41,207
You must be so disappointed.

519
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:44,448
You rushed back all the way from Paris, looking forward to tonight.

520
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,107
I am disappointed, but what can I do?

521
00:43:46,948 --> 00:43:48,048
Who are you?

522
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:49,377
(Laughing)

523
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,718
- Are you the lewd devil? - Yes, it's me.

524
00:43:52,017 --> 00:43:53,857
- My goodness, you're... - You were a she?

525
00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:55,417
- Of course. - You can talk too?

526
00:43:55,488 --> 00:43:56,928
Take your top off. Let's talk.

527
00:43:58,258 --> 00:44:00,857
- Gosh. Go away. - Aux Champs-Elysees

528
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:02,258
Let's do this!

529
00:44:02,258 --> 00:44:03,968
- Go away! - My gosh, go where?

530
00:44:03,968 --> 00:44:07,238
- Get lost! - Aux Champs-Elysees

531
00:44:07,238 --> 00:44:08,298
The devil was female?

532
00:44:08,298 --> 00:44:10,537
Young Joon, you fool

533
00:44:10,738 --> 00:44:11,837
I'm getting goosebumps.

534
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:14,278
(Snickering)

535
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:29,718
You shouldn't drink anymore. You might actually get drunk.

536
00:44:31,828 --> 00:44:33,698
I'm just really enjoying this meal.

537
00:44:34,857 --> 00:44:37,698
By the way, what's this called again?

538
00:44:39,627 --> 00:44:40,698
Guodaknown?

539
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:43,937
No, it's guobaorou.

540
00:44:44,707 --> 00:44:47,207
That's right, guobaorou.

541
00:44:49,178 --> 00:44:51,647
I've never had sweet and sour pork that is this chewy.

542
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:56,218
And I've never had liquor with such a rich aroma before.

543
00:44:57,417 --> 00:44:59,517
I'm going to treat myself to these things on my birthday.

544
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:02,218
My birthday is May 17,

545
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:04,258
so how long would I have to wait?

546
00:45:05,488 --> 00:45:08,598
Come on. Why would you wait until next May just to eat...

547
00:45:08,598 --> 00:45:10,098
guobaorou and drink this liquor?

548
00:45:15,837 --> 00:45:19,267
Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you.

549
00:45:21,337 --> 00:45:25,078
You were the first one that got promoted amongst your peers,

550
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:27,448
and I heard that you get the highest bonus as well.

551
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:31,948
Why are you being this frugal?

552
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:38,328
That's a secret.

553
00:45:40,227 --> 00:45:43,698
You see, the fact that you only own one suit...

554
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:47,437
and that you live in a rooftop room is nothing to be ashamed of.

555
00:45:48,138 --> 00:45:51,868
Why do you want to hide it so much? I don't really get it.

556
00:45:54,138 --> 00:45:55,578
Because it can be viewed as a flaw.

557
00:45:58,578 --> 00:45:59,707
When I was young,

558
00:46:00,977 --> 00:46:02,948
my family lived in a tiny single-room apartment.

559
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:07,087
Back then, I thought everyone lived like that.

560
00:46:08,118 --> 00:46:10,058
We were happy in that tiny apartment,

561
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:14,258
so I was never ashamed of it.

562
00:46:15,897 --> 00:46:16,997
But...

563
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,528
as I got older,

564
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:27,638
people made me feel ashamed of it.

565
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:31,908
They could...

566
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:34,877
just say that I get good grades,

567
00:46:36,218 --> 00:46:37,448
but instead,

568
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:40,687
they say I get good grades despite my family's financial situation.

569
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:44,328
I was...

570
00:46:45,187 --> 00:46:47,928
the first one to land a job out of my friends who graduated with me.

571
00:46:48,997 --> 00:46:52,198
They could've just congratulated me,

572
00:46:53,968 --> 00:46:57,107
but they said I did well despite my family's financial situation.

573
00:47:02,638 --> 00:47:04,178
That's why my goal is...

574
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:08,517
saving a lot of money...

575
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:10,687
so that I can buy a house...

576
00:47:12,187 --> 00:47:15,457
and make sure that my future wife and children...

577
00:47:16,787 --> 00:47:19,227
won't have to hear things like that from anybody.

578
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:24,968
And that being said,

579
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:27,138
I've already saved up 100,000 dollars.

580
00:47:28,897 --> 00:47:31,408
What? 100,000 dollars?

581
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,877
That's amazing.

582
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:38,247
This is only your fourth year at the company. How did you manage to...

583
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:42,247
I only spend 100 dollars a month.

584
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:48,158
And I invest my savings in stocks to earn extra income.

585
00:47:50,627 --> 00:47:51,687
You see,

586
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,598
I'll share the joy of spending...

587
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:58,798
with my family, which I'll create down the road.

588
00:48:04,337 --> 00:48:05,408
Anyway,

589
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:09,107
since I got to experience this chewy delicacy today thanks to you,

590
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,278
I will...

591
00:48:12,448 --> 00:48:16,348
invite you when I have guobaorou again next year...

592
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:19,687
on my birthday.

593
00:48:34,598 --> 00:48:36,167
You might be thirsty in the middle of the night.

594
00:48:47,317 --> 00:48:48,417
Mi So.

595
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:51,988
I heard you're quitting your job.

596
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,687
Did Pil Nam and Mal Hee tell you?

597
00:48:55,457 --> 00:48:58,187
When I heard that you had made up your mind to quit...

598
00:48:58,558 --> 00:49:00,158
because you wanted to find yourself,

599
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:03,968
my heart ached so much for you that I couldn't even eat for a while.

600
00:49:05,397 --> 00:49:08,238
It's my fault that you haven't been able to live...

601
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:10,067
the way you wanted to live your life.

602
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:16,008
I kept pursuing what I wanted to do and never even earned...

603
00:49:16,238 --> 00:49:17,877
enough money to support you properly.

604
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:20,848
Don't say that.

605
00:49:22,517 --> 00:49:25,548
Doing music like this was always your dream.

606
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:27,558
I'm happy you're living that life.

607
00:49:30,058 --> 00:49:31,558
Dream...

608
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:34,258
I don't even know anymore.

609
00:49:35,328 --> 00:49:39,028
It's just that it's the only thing I can do now.

610
00:49:42,497 --> 00:49:45,868
Had my dream been becoming a doctor or a judge,

611
00:49:47,337 --> 00:49:51,048
you girls would've been able to live more comfortable lives.

612
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,917
Dad, don't say that.

613
00:49:56,988 --> 00:50:00,388
I decided to quit because I want to get some rest.

614
00:50:00,888 --> 00:50:03,787
So don't worry about it and get some sleep now.

615
00:50:06,028 --> 00:50:08,497
Mi So, even Beyonce...

616
00:50:09,857 --> 00:50:12,528
became more successful after she left Destiny's Child...

617
00:50:13,537 --> 00:50:15,738
and established her career as a solo artist.

618
00:50:16,738 --> 00:50:18,067
The same goes for you.

619
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:21,707
I know that leaving Mr. Lee will help you...

620
00:50:22,578 --> 00:50:23,948
become more successful.

621
00:50:26,008 --> 00:50:28,917
Shall we fall asleep while listening to a song that is...

622
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:30,317
perfect for a night like this?

623
00:50:31,317 --> 00:50:32,647
The song your mom used to like.

624
00:50:34,017 --> 00:50:35,758
- Sure, sounds good. - All right.

625
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,408
("You Always By My Side")

626
00:51:44,428 --> 00:51:46,528
Ms. Kim, are you sleeping?

627
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:56,198
(Mr. Lee: Ms. Kim, are you sleeping?)

628
00:52:02,607 --> 00:52:04,948
(Ms. Kim, are you sleeping?)

629
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:06,877
I guess she's asleep.

630
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:09,848
She could've messaged me to let me know.

631
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:13,218
It's even harder to get a hold of her than when I was in Paris.

632
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:52,087
Gosh, you. Young Joon, you look handsome as always.

633
00:52:54,558 --> 00:52:56,058
(Mi So)

634
00:53:00,298 --> 00:53:03,267
She made a big mistake of falling asleep without even texting me,

635
00:53:03,607 --> 00:53:05,167
but I'll let it slide since she's calling me early.

636
00:53:07,878 --> 00:53:08,878
Yes, Ms. Kim.

637
00:53:09,207 --> 00:53:13,048
Yes, Mr. Lee. I think I need to take the morning off.

638
00:53:14,017 --> 00:53:15,077
Take the morning off?

639
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:17,617
Pil Nam can come only in the afternoon.

640
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:20,117
So I need to stay at the hospital until the afternoon.

641
00:53:21,057 --> 00:53:23,017
You don't have any urgent business today,

642
00:53:23,017 --> 00:53:25,428
and Ji Ah can handle most of the things now.

643
00:53:25,488 --> 00:53:27,997
All right. Then I will see you in the afternoon.

644
00:53:28,658 --> 00:53:29,898
Okay. Thank you.

645
00:53:44,948 --> 00:53:48,148
I never knew the half-day leave system was such a sad thing.

646
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:52,287
Should I drop by and see her for a short while?

647
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:55,088
Mr. Yang, take me to Seyeon Hospital.

648
00:53:55,258 --> 00:53:56,318
Okay, sir.

649
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:05,906
Ms. Kim, you will be very surprised to know where I am now.

650
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:08,247
I am at the lobby of Seyeon Hospital.

651
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:11,077
What? Why did you go there?

652
00:54:12,017 --> 00:54:14,917
Yes. It is just as you expected. I've come to see you.

653
00:54:15,046 --> 00:54:16,647
I wanted to show you my face for a short while.

654
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:19,316
Oh, dear. I am outside right now.

655
00:54:19,486 --> 00:54:21,127
- What? - I had...

656
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:22,986
to get a few things from Dad's.

657
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:25,796
All right, then. I should go up alone...

658
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:27,796
and say hello to my future father-in-law.

659
00:54:27,866 --> 00:54:29,167
You can't do that.

660
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,466
Why not?

661
00:54:33,097 --> 00:54:36,707
He doesn't even know that we are in a relationship.

662
00:54:37,977 --> 00:54:39,176
You have a meeting...

663
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,676
at 10am on launching new routes for the airline.

664
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,147
I think you should hurry back.

665
00:54:44,377 --> 00:54:45,446
Okay. I will do that then.

666
00:54:57,296 --> 00:55:00,227
Revenue status of Yumyung Electronics.

667
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:03,937
Why is this job never-ending?

668
00:55:12,707 --> 00:55:15,077
Ms. Kim took the morning off.

669
00:55:15,807 --> 00:55:17,017
I got the call.

670
00:55:21,086 --> 00:55:24,557
Of course he did. She's his girlfriend.

671
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:30,227
He looks really sad without his girlfriend.

672
00:55:30,926 --> 00:55:32,796
He's got the eyes of a romantic.

673
00:55:34,696 --> 00:55:38,366
I hope someone will look at me with those eyes too.

674
00:55:45,377 --> 00:55:48,147
Take this.

675
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:49,946
What is this?

676
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:54,147
It's the summary of Yumyung Electornics' revenue data.

677
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:57,256
I was supposed to do this.

678
00:55:58,256 --> 00:55:59,457
Well,

679
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:02,756
you treated me chewy sweet and sour pork yesterday.

680
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:04,256
I was grateful for that,

681
00:56:05,256 --> 00:56:07,267
and I thought it would help me get the hang of the work.

682
00:56:15,336 --> 00:56:16,836
Thank you.

683
00:56:18,176 --> 00:56:21,676
It's a lot of data. It must've been tough to summarize.

684
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:23,776
Ji Ah.

685
00:56:24,877 --> 00:56:27,347
How do you feel when you walk in the forest?

686
00:56:27,546 --> 00:56:28,616
What?

687
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:33,057
It must be refreshing and healing.

688
00:56:33,787 --> 00:56:35,227
Work is like that to me.

689
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:39,097
Nothing feels more refreshing and healing than finishing work.

690
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:40,597
So...

691
00:56:42,026 --> 00:56:43,196
don't feel too pressured.

692
00:56:53,506 --> 00:56:54,807
It heals you?

693
00:56:57,946 --> 00:56:59,077
It heals me too.

694
00:57:08,886 --> 00:57:10,296
Thank you.

695
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:11,997
- Eat slowly. - Okay.

696
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:13,997
Dad.

697
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,497
My first daughter is here.

698
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:16,866
Yes.

699
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:18,866
You are eating.

700
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:22,437
You have to go to work, right? Let's eat lunch together.

701
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:24,836
Dad, I will take her out for lunch.

702
00:57:24,836 --> 00:57:26,006
Okay. Go ahead.

703
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,077
Ms. Kim, when are you coming?

704
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,716
Let's go, Mi So. What do you want to eat?

705
00:57:31,877 --> 00:57:34,247
I have to go straight to the office.

706
00:57:34,486 --> 00:57:36,347
You should eat lunch though.

707
00:57:36,716 --> 00:57:38,687
I have something to tell you as well.

708
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:40,656
Something to tell me?

709
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:44,756
I hope you will come as soon as possible.

710
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:46,727
(I hope you will come as soon as possible.)

711
00:57:52,397 --> 00:57:54,836
Mr. Lee. What would you like to have for lunch?

712
00:57:55,307 --> 00:57:57,906
I will take care of it. You don't need to worry.

713
00:57:58,136 --> 00:57:59,437
All right, sir.

714
00:58:04,446 --> 00:58:06,316
I will have lunch with Ms. Kim when she comes back.

715
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:16,156
(Mr. Lee)

716
00:58:18,526 --> 00:58:20,627
Ms. Kim, are you on the way?

717
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:23,267
I'll be there soon.

718
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:24,866
(I will be there soon.)

719
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:30,107
I need to get back soon. What is the thing you wanted to tell me?

720
00:58:34,046 --> 00:58:35,776
Here. Take this.

721
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,676
What is this?

722
00:58:37,776 --> 00:58:40,247
My friend is opening a clinic,

723
00:58:40,247 --> 00:58:43,187
and I'm going to work for him. So I quit my job.

724
00:58:43,756 --> 00:58:46,216
That's my severance. It's for you.

725
00:58:47,426 --> 00:58:49,457
Don't do this. Why would you give this to me?

726
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:51,097
Why do you think so?

727
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:54,627
You worked hard for nine years,

728
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:55,827
but you spent everything you earned to pay back our debt.

729
00:58:55,926 --> 00:58:57,997
You paid back both of your sisters' student loans.

730
00:58:58,366 --> 00:59:00,466
You have no savings right now.

731
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:04,006
Still, I can't take this.

732
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:06,636
Why can't you? Keep it.

733
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,647
You might get married. You can't be broke.

734
00:59:10,877 --> 00:59:13,316
It's way too early to talk about marriage.

735
00:59:13,946 --> 00:59:15,616
Don't talk too soon.

736
00:59:15,946 --> 00:59:19,116
Anyway, it's yours. It's up to you what you do with it.

737
00:59:19,787 --> 00:59:21,057
Excuse me.

738
00:59:21,227 --> 00:59:24,026
- How much is it? - Please wait.

739
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:39,006
Look.

740
00:59:39,836 --> 00:59:42,247
That dress would look so good on you.

741
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:43,847
Do you want me to buy you that?

742
00:59:44,077 --> 00:59:45,276
No, I have to hurry back.

743
00:59:45,276 --> 00:59:47,917
It won't take long to buy it. Let's go.

744
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,316
But it's fine.

745
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:10,877
Young Joon.

746
01:00:11,736 --> 01:00:13,037
Despite being hungry,

747
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:15,776
you are patiently waiting so that you can eat with your lover.

748
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:19,377
You are very loyal and sweet.

749
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:28,057
She's back.

750
01:00:29,156 --> 01:00:30,256
What is that?

751
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:37,437
Was he late because she was buying a gift for me?

752
01:00:46,906 --> 01:00:48,307
I'm back, Mr. Lee.

753
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:49,776
How is your father?

754
01:00:49,906 --> 01:00:52,347
Thanks to you, he's very comfortable.

755
01:00:52,877 --> 01:00:53,917
I'm glad to hear that.

756
01:00:54,347 --> 01:00:56,147
Shall we go for lunch?

757
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,586
I already had lunch.

758
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:01,727
I didn't eat lunch.

759
01:01:02,656 --> 01:01:03,656
Why?

760
01:01:04,057 --> 01:01:07,026
Why? I waited so we can eat together.

761
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:13,236
Pil Nam asked me to eat with her.

762
01:01:16,466 --> 01:01:17,636
I see.

763
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,446
You are late because you had lunch.

764
01:01:23,877 --> 01:01:27,486
Is that why you felt sorry and bought that gift for me?

765
01:01:28,347 --> 01:01:29,616
Gift?

766
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:33,057
When you were coming in, you had a shopping bag.

767
01:01:34,086 --> 01:01:35,357
That's...

768
01:01:36,256 --> 01:01:37,557
my clothes.

769
01:01:43,736 --> 01:01:44,997
So you were late...

770
01:01:45,296 --> 01:01:47,167
because you were out eating lunch and shopping...

771
01:01:48,736 --> 01:01:49,966
for your clothes?

772
01:01:50,537 --> 01:01:53,406
- That's not it. - Don't you think about me?

773
01:01:55,347 --> 01:01:58,147
I want to spend every minute with you.

774
01:01:58,377 --> 01:02:01,586
But it seems that's not the case for you. I am disappointed.

775
01:02:03,046 --> 01:02:05,687
- I am sorry. - If you are sorry,

776
01:02:07,687 --> 01:02:09,457
should we leave work and go to my house?

777
01:02:13,526 --> 01:02:14,897
Why are you looking at me with those eyes?

778
01:02:17,397 --> 01:02:21,636
Since yesterday, you've been reminding me of this vocabulary.

779
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:23,977
Wait. Wait.

780
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:27,477
Is it "sexy"?

781
01:02:27,807 --> 01:02:28,877
Is it "provocative"?

782
01:02:29,406 --> 01:02:30,517
"Fatal".

783
01:02:32,276 --> 01:02:33,276
No.

784
01:02:33,946 --> 01:02:35,086
It's "bulldozer".

785
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:36,917
What?

786
01:02:37,557 --> 01:02:40,187
You keep pushing me.

787
01:02:40,526 --> 01:02:42,486
So you are like a bulldozer.

788
01:02:48,296 --> 01:02:50,866
What? "Bulldozer"?

789
01:02:52,364 --> 01:02:54,804
What? "Bulldozer"?

790
01:02:58,552 --> 01:03:00,883
What did you push her into doing?

791
01:03:00,883 --> 01:03:03,992
You sexy bulldozer. You sly creature.

792
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:06,963
Young Joon.

793
01:03:08,563 --> 01:03:12,233
Although I got divorced, and I'm regretting it,

794
01:03:12,233 --> 01:03:15,102
I'll give you some advice being that I am your superior regarding love.

795
01:03:15,233 --> 01:03:16,302
Wait.

796
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:19,573
If this advice is a cheap one about panties,

797
01:03:19,573 --> 01:03:21,642
I will refuse it.

798
01:03:21,642 --> 01:03:23,512
But the content was high quality.

799
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:25,512
Listen to me carefully again, my friend.

800
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:30,412
When dating Ms. Kim, this is what you should keep in mind.

801
01:03:31,483 --> 01:03:34,023
It's that this is the first relationship for Ms. Kim.

802
01:03:35,383 --> 01:03:38,093
Is it the second for me? This is my first relationship too.

803
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:40,262
I like her, I feel excited, and I want to treat her well.

804
01:03:40,262 --> 01:03:43,332
But you can't keep pushing her.

805
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:46,903
Then?

806
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:50,633
Just pushing her won't deepen your relationship.

807
01:03:50,773 --> 01:03:54,843
You have to do in moderation. And take your time. Understand?

808
01:03:56,472 --> 01:03:59,543
I have to do it in moderation and take my time.

809
01:04:01,082 --> 01:04:02,613
Just hearing that frustrates me.

810
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:05,983
I am crazy about her right now. How can I do that?

811
01:04:06,782 --> 01:04:08,323
If you can't,

812
01:04:09,082 --> 01:04:10,552
she will get tired of you.

813
01:04:12,023 --> 01:04:14,262
What? Get tired of me?

814
01:04:15,923 --> 01:04:18,932
I look perfect, and I always exude fresh charms.

815
01:04:18,932 --> 01:04:20,102
How can she ever get tired of me?

816
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:23,872
That's a word I won't have in my dictionary.

817
01:04:23,872 --> 01:04:26,102
Think rationally, Young Joon.

818
01:04:26,472 --> 01:04:28,773
What will happen if you splint like Usain Bolt...

819
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:32,372
next to someone who just started to walk?

820
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:36,043
At first, she will try to keep up with you.

821
01:04:36,552 --> 01:04:40,023
But in the end, she will get tired and leave you.

822
01:04:40,483 --> 01:04:43,622
Controlling speed is very important in a relationship.

823
01:04:50,563 --> 01:04:51,793
You're here, Mr. Park.

824
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,233
I bought this on the way here from lunch.

825
01:04:58,233 --> 01:05:00,372
This is really good. Try it.

826
01:05:04,073 --> 01:05:05,173
My goodness..

827
01:05:06,173 --> 01:05:08,512
Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry.

828
01:05:10,983 --> 01:05:12,952
It's fine. It's not like I am bleeding.

829
01:05:14,983 --> 01:05:17,023
Let me go and get something to clean that up with.

830
01:05:23,063 --> 01:05:25,793
It's nothing. It's nothing. It happens all the time.

831
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:27,802
Excuse me.

832
01:05:34,003 --> 01:05:35,142
How patient you are.

833
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:40,142
See?

834
01:05:40,543 --> 01:05:43,082
It happens so much that I already have spare shirts.

835
01:05:44,883 --> 01:05:45,912
Did you see that?

836
01:05:46,383 --> 01:05:49,082
This is what happens when you fail to control the speed.

837
01:05:50,352 --> 01:05:53,262
I am sure you don't want to become a wreck like this.

838
01:05:54,523 --> 01:05:55,563
Right?

839
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:08,642
My hero.

840
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,313
Tonight? Of course we should go on a date.

841
01:06:14,082 --> 01:06:16,342
Yes. I will see you in the evening then.

842
01:06:18,113 --> 01:06:20,182
Things must be going well with that guy.

843
01:06:22,882 --> 01:06:25,422
We decided to become a couple.

844
01:06:27,222 --> 01:06:28,323
That's good news.

845
01:06:29,493 --> 01:06:31,563
By the way, what should we do in the evening?

846
01:06:32,132 --> 01:06:34,233
We should eat dinner, watch a movie together,

847
01:06:34,632 --> 01:06:35,863
have a drink,

848
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:37,903
walk along the Han River...

849
01:06:38,002 --> 01:06:39,733
You do all of those in one day?

850
01:06:40,703 --> 01:06:44,042
We can stay up all night together. I don't want to part with him.

851
01:06:44,142 --> 01:06:45,542
I like him so much.

852
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,813
The night is long,

853
01:06:50,712 --> 01:06:53,323
so we are going to kiss.

854
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:55,653
- My goodness. - What my goodness?

855
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:57,453
I'm the one to say that.

856
01:06:58,092 --> 01:06:59,693
We just started dating.

857
01:06:59,693 --> 01:07:02,693
So we are burning with passion.

858
01:07:03,193 --> 01:07:06,262
We are adults, not saints. You know?

859
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:07,863
Good day.

860
01:07:24,182 --> 01:07:25,182
Excuse me.

861
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:31,292
I am sorry for not controlling the speed.

862
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:34,323
What?

863
01:07:35,762 --> 01:07:36,993
Thinking back,

864
01:07:38,033 --> 01:07:39,762
I think I was being too impatient.

865
01:07:45,132 --> 01:07:48,743
It's as if all the feelings I've been suppressing...

866
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:51,542
in the past nine years just burst at one time.

867
01:07:53,882 --> 01:07:54,943
Mr. Lee.

868
01:07:57,852 --> 01:08:01,123
What happened in the past was truly horrible.

869
01:08:03,953 --> 01:08:07,823
But if I have to go back in time and go through it again,

870
01:08:10,563 --> 01:08:11,733
I would.

871
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:15,163
Only if I can meet you again.

872
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:24,042
Still, I will take it slower.

873
01:08:24,743 --> 01:08:25,943
Since that's what you want.

874
01:08:31,182 --> 01:08:34,722
You may go now. I have an appointment, so I'll go.

875
01:09:06,552 --> 01:09:09,422
What are you doing here, Mi So?

876
01:09:13,363 --> 01:09:15,962
I came to apologize about...

877
01:09:17,563 --> 01:09:19,563
not being more considerate of your feelings.

878
01:09:26,873 --> 01:09:27,943
And...

879
01:09:32,443 --> 01:09:33,443
And?

880
01:09:37,783 --> 01:09:41,382
I won't go home tonight.

881
01:09:46,493 --> 01:09:47,563
What?

882
01:09:49,693 --> 01:09:50,962
I won't go home...

883
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:55,333
and stay with you all night.

884
01:10:05,642 --> 01:10:07,813
If you enter my house right now,

885
01:10:10,113 --> 01:10:11,852
I won't be able to control my speed.

886
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:18,092
I don't...

887
01:10:20,462 --> 01:10:22,092
plan on stopping today.

888
01:12:26,212 --> 01:12:27,323
I love you.

889
01:12:30,493 --> 01:12:31,823
I love you too.
