1
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:14,736
Right. If it's for victory,

2
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:18,005
you don't mind running very close to a strange man.

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:21,445
Of course. It's better than becoming a loser.

4
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,575
Right. As long as you win,

5
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:25,976
you don't care about who you touch.

6
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:27,176
That's right.

7
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:34,985
Even if that person is this close to you?

8
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:36,586
Of course.

9
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,296
What about this?

10
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:42,595
It doesn't affect me.

11
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,866
How about this?

12
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:13,056
I'll go get an ice pack.

13
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:53,466
Oh...

14
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,136
Did he fall asleep already?

15
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:11,745
Little child.

16
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,046
Can you help me?

17
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:19,516
Come over here.

18
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:21,256
Come here.

19
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,055
- No! - Mr. Lee.

20
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,126
Mr. Lee!

21
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,275
Are you all right?

22
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:10,705
Please have some tea.

23
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,475
Are you feeling better now?

24
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:22,386
Yes, thanks to you.

25
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,785
Do you get sleep paralysis often?

26
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,056
I don't know.

27
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:40,465
I... don't want to be left alone tonight.

28
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,105
- Ms. Kim. - Yes, sir?

29
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:51,116
Can't you sleep here...

30
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,316
just for tonight?

31
00:04:58,316 --> 00:04:59,316
Pardon?

32
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,355
Sleep here tonight.

33
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:05,826
What?

34
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:08,066
What do you mean by that?

35
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,736
I know that it's only natural to feel scared...

36
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,605
when waking up from a nightmare.

37
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:19,306
But you're not even a child, so how could you make such a request of me?

38
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,345
Wait, really?

39
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:29,886
I'm saying that you should sleep in the guest room, since it's late.

40
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,186
So... why are you getting all flustered?

41
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:34,686
What?

42
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,585
You used to sleep here occasionally when you were working late.

43
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:43,566
Yes, you're right. I did.

44
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:49,205
What is wrong with me?

45
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:56,676
What were you expecting?

46
00:05:57,605 --> 00:05:59,645
What do you mean? I wasn't expecting anything.

47
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:08,986
Yes?

48
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,626
Sure.

49
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,306
Unfortunately, I don't think you'll be able to sleep over tonight.

50
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:28,876
Sorry to disappoint you.

51
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:30,645
What do you mean, "disappoint you"?

52
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,915
I had no intentions whatsoever of sleeping here tonight.

53
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:36,386
You seem to be fine now, sir, so I will be going home now.

54
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:37,486
If you'll excuse me.

55
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:55,965
I wonder who called him.

56
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,736
He didn't look too happy.

57
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:03,475
(Episode 4)

58
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:06,676
Geez, you startled me!

59
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,816
I'm so sorry!

60
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:10,316
You should be more careful.

61
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:12,616
The screen doesn't appear to be broken.

62
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:13,756
No, not that.

63
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,395
It's fine.

64
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:20,926
You'll trip if you walk around like this.

65
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,525
I can do it myself.

66
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,136
Thank you.

67
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:31,806
- Here you go. - All right, then. Goodbye.

68
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:39,645
What a sweet person.

69
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,715
Quite different from a certain someone I know.

70
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,535
You're not even going to invite me to sit down?

71
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:05,405
What do you want at this hour?

72
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,636
Does an older brother need a reason to visit his little brother's house?

73
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:12,645
I came back since my new novel is being published next month.

74
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,176
I came here without any prior notice...

75
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:15,886
and found out that Mother and Father are at Jeju Island.

76
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:17,886
I didn't feel like going to an empty house...

77
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:19,756
and also figured that it'd be nice for me to pay you a visit.

78
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:26,496
To tell you the truth...

79
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:28,965
I came here because I wanted to forgive you.

80
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:32,095
It's still quite difficult for me...

81
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:34,805
because I still keep remembering that incident.

82
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:37,266
But hating you and resenting you...

83
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:39,675
just made me more miserable.

84
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:42,075
That's why I figured...

85
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,246
that I'll just forgive you now.

86
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,116
Shall we have some drinks?

87
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,356
I indulged myself heavily in three things while I was in France.

88
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:54,285
Writing, women,

89
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:56,956
- and wine. - You should leave now.

90
00:08:58,325 --> 00:08:59,756
- What? - I'm tired.

91
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:34,766
I've gotten rid of them, sir.

92
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,866
- Are you all right? - Who did this?

93
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:41,636
There's been so much on my mind lately that I forgot.

94
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:42,706
I apologize.

95
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:57,616
I've disposed of them all, sir.

96
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:00,655
Are you all right, sir?

97
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:07,655
Ms. Kim Mi So.

98
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:09,325
Yes, sir?

99
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,295
You said that you're deathly afraid of spiders, right?

100
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:15,706
Yes, sir.

101
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,405
That's what cable ties are like for me.

102
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:23,006
So don't use that anymore.

103
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:25,075
I beg of you.

104
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,545
Yes, sir. I understand.

105
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,956
That was the first day that my boss, who seemed flawless in every way,

106
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:45,165
acted like an average person in front of me.

107
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:55,545
Ouch, that stings!

108
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:03,145
Maybe I tied my foot too tightly for the race earlier.

109
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:11,525
- Why do you keep saying it's okay? - No.

110
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,665
What's the scar on his ankle?

111
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,065
What on earth happened to him in the past?

112
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:40,086
Is your ankle okay?

113
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:44,226
I canceled all your schedules for this week so you could relax.

114
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,766
I asked Ms. Shin to prepare some hot towels for your ankle.

115
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:49,996
Goodnight.

116
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,035
There she nags again.

117
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:54,236
It's very tiring.

118
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:11,315
I'm sorry I'm late, Ms. Kim.

119
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,956
It's okay, but make sure you come early from tomorrow on.

120
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:16,726
Okay.

121
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,496
Oh, right. Is the vice chairman's ankle okay?

122
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:22,025
It's not serious, but I think it's better for him to rest a little,

123
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,726
so I've canceled today's schedule.

124
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,496
Please rearrange the canceled schedule.

125
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:26,736
Okay.

126
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:28,266
Let me do it.

127
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,945
- What should we do? - We need to report this quickly.

128
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:39,145
- You're distracting. - It's an emergency situation.

129
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:41,086
- What's going on? - Well...

130
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:44,346
UK Group Art Center has advanced its opening day...

131
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,516
- to the beginning of August. - What?

132
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,525
What's wrong with that?

133
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:52,025
You just don't have any clue, do you?

134
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:54,895
Our art center is scheduled to open on August 20.

135
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:57,195
They've advanced their schedule on purpose.

136
00:12:57,295 --> 00:13:00,035
We must open our art center first to gather all attention.

137
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:01,506
The vice chairman is very much concerned about this...

138
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:03,006
because the opening dates are close to each other.

139
00:13:03,006 --> 00:13:05,405
- Before he comes, let's come up... - We have one solution.

140
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:08,746
Hello.

141
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,346
We'll advance our opening date to July.

142
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,586
That's next month.

143
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,645
There are only a few days left.

144
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,185
Okay, we'll get things ready.

145
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:21,325
- What? - What?

146
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:31,496
Here, I got this from the planning team.

147
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,795
Hello, this is the Office of Vice Chairman.

148
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,665
He's heading to the art center.

149
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:37,976
He wants to advance the opening day to July.

150
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:40,305
I'm printing out the documents about the opening events.

151
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,846
Get them ready so that he can read them on his way.

152
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,356
Can we open the museum next month without any problem?

153
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:53,655
Well, unfortunately,

154
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:57,456
the main art piece of the outdoor exhibition is not complete yet.

155
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,726
It requires much time to move and install the piece.

156
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:00,956
Support the artists...

157
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:04,266
so that they can move the materials first and complete the piece here.

158
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:05,366
Okay.

159
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:09,035
Can we open the concert hall next month without any problem?

160
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,476
Well, unfortunately...

161
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:15,606
Can we open the library next month without any problem?

162
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,846
- Well... - Is it...

163
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,915
- unfortunately not ready either? - I'm sorry.

164
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:23,886
We haven't dealt with the copyright issues...

165
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:25,785
regarding video aids such as movies and documentaries.

166
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:28,956
It won't be a problem as long as we don't hold a movie screening.

167
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,626
You can hold movie screening events...

168
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,395
in order of those which copyright issues have been settled.

169
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,395
I know you're flustered due to the sudden change in the schedule,

170
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:40,136
but please get things ready without any mistake.

171
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:41,435
Okay, sir.

172
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,805
Let's walk more around the library.

173
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:44,976
Yes, sir.

174
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,016
It's been designed amazingly.

175
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,516
I want to read books all day long in here.

176
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:02,025
It's a success then because that's the first intention of this place.

177
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:07,766
Gosh.

178
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,466
I'll call and check the situation.

179
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,766
Yes, hello.

180
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:19,706
The entire building has lost its power?

181
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,846
No, you don't have to come here.

182
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,246
Please restore the system first.

183
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,970
Yes.

184
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:27,216
I can't believe this.

185
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:31,216
Isn't it about time they finished dealing with facility problems?

186
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:38,033
Gosh.

187
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,703
I'll call and check the situation.

188
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:47,002
Yes, hello.

189
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,872
The entire building has lost its power?

190
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,043
No, you don't have to come here.

191
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:53,512
Please restore the system first.

192
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,236
Yes.

193
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:57,413
I can't believe this.

194
00:15:57,752 --> 00:16:01,453
Isn't it about time they finished dealing with facility problems?

195
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:08,732
You startled me.

196
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,863
I'm sorry. I only tried to turn on the flashlight for you.

197
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,832
Are you sure it was for me?

198
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,232
Of course.

199
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:19,002
Your face expression just now looked a little cute though.

200
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:23,913
Gosh.

201
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:37,353
Ms. Kim, I'm not cute. I'm fatally attractive.

202
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:40,163
My mistake.

203
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:41,792
Come this way.

204
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:32,082
Well...

205
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,992
This is one of my favorite books.

206
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,463
("Every Moment Was You")

207
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:55,433
All my dating romance is in this book.

208
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:41,453
(You've got to date someone like this.)

209
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,953
I especially love this part.

210
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,653
"I want to be in the kind of relationship..."

211
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:53,863
"where I feel like the tiredness of my day gets washed off..."

212
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,963
"just by hugging you once..."

213
00:18:57,363 --> 00:19:00,963
"even if you don't make my heart..."

214
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:02,472
"flutter every second."

215
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:09,742
Isn't it good?

216
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:20,953
It's childish.

217
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,853
My first-class shower...

218
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:25,363
equipped with the anion, vitamin, and sterilization system...

219
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:27,393
is enough to wash off the tiredness of my day.

220
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,062
That's not what it means.

221
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:34,133
You might think it's childish,

222
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:37,873
but this is the kind of love which I dream of.

223
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:59,322
Have I ever told you that you were pretty?

224
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:00,562
What?

225
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,703
No.

226
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:13,943
Well, of course not because I've never felt you were pretty.

227
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:26,582
They're taking quite some time to restore the system.

228
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:29,123
I'll call them again.

229
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:31,093
It's okay. Let's just go out.

230
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,393
It feels suffocating a little.

231
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:35,863
Okay.

232
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:42,272
This way.

233
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:01,393
Sir, the exit is that way.

234
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,822
You don't know the mechanism of buildings.

235
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:07,262
The exit is this way.

236
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:09,292
Well, okay.

237
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:27,542
Instead of the mechanism,

238
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,782
why don't you listen to someone who's been here often?

239
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:34,923
The exit is where I told you earlier.

240
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:44,262
It's indeed the design of a global architect chosen by me.

241
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:48,002
His innovative design destroys the mechanism of buildings.

242
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:52,343
I'll make sure to use it for our marketing strategy.

243
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:53,873
Follow me.

244
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,752
Did you put on perfume by any chance?

245
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:09,153
No, I don't use perfume.

246
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:11,593
I smell a citrus scent from you.

247
00:22:12,193 --> 00:22:14,992
It must be the scent of my shampoo then.

248
00:22:15,062 --> 00:22:18,532
I buy this product because they often do a buy-1-get-1 promotion.

249
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,332
Buy-1-get-1 free.

250
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,213
Did you always walk this fast?

251
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:32,982
I walked fast to keep up with your stride, so it became my habit.

252
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:35,582
Then again, my stride is twice longer than others'.

253
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:37,153
It must've been hard to keep up with me.

254
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,183
I'm fully used to it now.

255
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:43,123
Why didn't I notice your walking pace before though?

256
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:45,193
It's said that your senses become sharp in the dark,

257
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:48,163
so you notice things that you haven't in your daily life.

258
00:22:55,772 --> 00:22:58,643
What are you doing? You might trip if you fall behind.

259
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:16,193
You're right...

260
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:20,123
about how my senses...

261
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:22,893
become sharper in the dark.

262
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:43,782
You said I shouldn't trip.

263
00:23:58,863 --> 00:24:00,363
The lights are back on.

264
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,113
- I'll get the car ready. - Okay.

265
00:24:16,982 --> 00:24:19,522
I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience.

266
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:23,552
It's okay. It wasn't so inconvenient.

267
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:34,572
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

268
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:38,143
Are there any other events in the library other than movie screening?

269
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:42,072
No, there are a lot of exhibitions and musicals scheduled already.

270
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:45,542
But the library didn't feel so bad.

271
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:49,383
Tell them to prepare for the opening event in the library too.

272
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,123
I'll deliver your message.

273
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:57,522
I'll think about ideas for the opening event too.

274
00:24:58,093 --> 00:24:59,163
You will?

275
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:02,232
Yes, we're running out of time,

276
00:25:02,562 --> 00:25:05,363
and it's something from your direct concern.

277
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:22,552
Now.

278
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:26,953
Amazing.

279
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:29,822
- You're good at grilling pork skin. - I know, right?

280
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:33,262
Its color gets much more appetizing if you flip it five seconds later.

281
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:44,002
Open up.

282
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,443
What are you thinking?

283
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:52,883
I need an idea for the opening event in the library.

284
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:54,183
Is that a part of your job too?

285
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,413
You're going to resign soon, so don't work too hard.

286
00:25:57,953 --> 00:26:00,822
Right, in the perspective of a psychiatrist,

287
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:02,893
your behavior is a symptom of over adaptation.

288
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,663
It's so called, workaholic.

289
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,562
No, I'm just trying my best until the end.

290
00:26:09,562 --> 00:26:11,703
You're working so hard like this...

291
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,472
that the vice chairman is anxious in case he'll lose you.

292
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:16,802
I heard it from her.

293
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:20,873
I heard his possessiveness over you is unbelievable.

294
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:23,242
You shared it with her already?

295
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:26,683
Shouldn't you flip the pieces, pork skin master?

296
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:28,582
Not yet, after 40 seconds.

297
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:31,222
By the way,

298
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:32,982
I think he's trying to...

299
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,792
change my mind not because of his simple possessiveness.

300
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:39,262
Maybe he really needs me.

301
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,062
- What? - I mean...

302
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,133
I keep having this thought about...

303
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:45,403
how things will be if I'm not around the vice chairman.

304
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,732
Don't tell me you like him.

305
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:52,943
What are you talking about? That doesn't make sense.

306
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:54,512
Don't overreact.

307
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:58,613
If that's not the case, put a clean end to it while you're at it.

308
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,383
Otherwise, you'll get swayed by him...

309
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:04,722
and have no choice but to live as his secretary all your life.

310
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:08,552
I know about it better than anyone else.

311
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:12,423
Grill it properly. I'm breathing in all the smoke.

312
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:13,863
Gosh.

313
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:16,762
I thought you were the master in grilling pork skin.

314
00:27:23,403 --> 00:27:25,603
What's wrong?

315
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:27,542
Hey.

316
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:32,512
It's dust. It's okay.

317
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:37,552
Pil Nam,

318
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:40,383
about phobia,

319
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:43,552
is it possible to overcome one day?

320
00:27:44,022 --> 00:27:45,193
Of course.

321
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,332
You'll get better eventually if you keep facing it.

322
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,933
Visit my office once after you quit work.

323
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:53,603
No.

324
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,703
It's not about me.

325
00:27:56,873 --> 00:27:58,072
Then whom are you talking about?

326
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:01,673
It's nothing.

327
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:17,492
I wonder what Ms. Kim is doing.

328
00:28:29,502 --> 00:28:31,472
("Every Moment Was You")

329
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:33,742
I can't believe she reads this childish stuff.

330
00:28:42,752 --> 00:28:46,482
(In this heavy and confusing life)

331
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:49,093
"In this heavy and confusing life,"

332
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:52,693
"while you deal with your business,"

333
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:58,232
"you wonder what they are doing all of a sudden..."

334
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:03,072
"and think of the person first aside from yourself."

335
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:08,542
"That's enough of a reason to call it love."

336
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:20,482
I obviously need to wonder what my secretary is doing to give her work.

337
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:23,423
Love? That doesn't make sense at all.

338
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,972
It's Morpheus.

339
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,153
I'm sorry.

340
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:52,953
There are so many articles about...

341
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:54,552
Morpheus and the release date for his new book.

342
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,222
I'm looking forward to reading his new book as well.

343
00:29:57,222 --> 00:29:59,292
- What was the title again? - "Once in a Lifetime."

344
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:01,693
I've already read the UK edition, you know.

345
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:03,663
It's about a sad love story that can...

346
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:05,103
only happen once in a lifetime.

347
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,032
I cried all night.

348
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:08,433
- Is it that sad? - Yes.

349
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:12,673
By the way, why do you think he never reveals himself in public?

350
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:15,472
If he reveals himself, it'll be such huge news.

351
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:17,512
It'll be the talk of the town, don't you think?

352
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:18,742
Yes, totally.

353
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:26,183
A book concert?

354
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:28,153
Yes, sir. I think it'd be a good idea...

355
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:29,752
to invite a buzz-worthy author...

356
00:30:29,752 --> 00:30:31,893
and host a book concert for the opening of the library.

357
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:34,163
Invite an author...

358
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:35,762
to generate buzz.

359
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:38,802
Then how about Joanne Rowling who wrote the "Harry Potter" series?

360
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:40,232
She'd be a great one to invite,

361
00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:41,572
but I think that Mor...

362
00:30:42,203 --> 00:30:43,873
What if I can't get Morpheus to do it...

363
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,673
after suggesting him to Mr. Lee?

364
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,272
Mor... Who?

365
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:51,683
I'm not sure who'd be the best one.

366
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,482
A plan without details.

367
00:30:57,683 --> 00:30:58,923
It's very unlike you.

368
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,522
Please give me a little bit of time. I won't disappoint you, sir.

369
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,562
- Why are you laughing? - I laughed?

370
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:12,603
Pardon me?

371
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:21,512
I'm in the lobby. I'll come up for a few minutes.

372
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:34,722
- Ms. Kim. - Yes, sir.

373
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:37,393
Do you know the brain uses a quarter of the calories we consume a day?

374
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:38,393
Sorry?

375
00:31:38,393 --> 00:31:40,292
I'm hungry because I overworked my brain.

376
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:41,792
I'll prepare some snacks, sir.

377
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:43,363
No, I know what I want to eat.

378
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:44,762
Go to the burger shop...

379
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:47,133
and get the two most expensive things on their menu...

380
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:48,832
along with two servings of freshly cooked french fries.

381
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:50,472
Make sure they fry them on the spot.

382
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:52,643
- Pardon me? - And on your way back,

383
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,742
pick up an Americano with an extra shot of espresso...

384
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:56,843
as well as a latte with two extra shots of expresso.

385
00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:58,843
No need to rush. Take your time.

386
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,482
2 packets of sugar and 2 straws too.

387
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:02,782
And make sure you bring five pieces of napkin.

388
00:32:03,482 --> 00:32:05,522
- But why suddenly... - Just do as I say.

389
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:06,653
Sorry?

390
00:32:07,123 --> 00:32:08,123
Yes, sir.

391
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:12,322
Don't use the elevator. Take the stairs.

392
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:13,923
- Pardon me? - Go. Now!

393
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:14,963
Yes, sir!

394
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,633
Why is he trying to get me out of the office?

397
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:47,163
You look like a different person in this office.

398
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:48,762
I thought you'd be my baby brother forever.

399
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:52,963
What brings you here?

400
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:55,133
I thought I already greeted and welcomed you.

401
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:57,373
I just wanted to visit.

402
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:00,203
I had a meeting with my publisher because of my new book...

403
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:01,512
and thought I should stop by.

404
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:02,643
Oh, right.

405
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:06,643
They gave me a few copies of my new book.

406
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:08,153
Do you want one?

407
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:12,883
Right.

408
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:15,223
You won't even read it anyway.

409
00:33:15,223 --> 00:33:16,693
It's a love story which you have no interest in.

410
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:19,963
Young Joon, you should date too.

411
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:21,232
You need to learn what love is...

412
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:23,792
to really understand the world.

413
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:27,602
There are many other things that I need to learn.

414
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:30,403
You're so cold to me.

415
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:32,343
I'd like you to leave.

416
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:34,673
As you can see, I'm quite busy now.

417
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:40,343
All right, you seem busy.

418
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,482
I'll see you next time.

419
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:11,042
Thank you.

420
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:15,452
The shoelaces.

421
00:34:16,113 --> 00:34:17,153
Yes.

422
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:19,223
It's nice to run into you like this.

423
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,783
Yes, it's nice to see you. I have to go.

424
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,622
I've been regretting not asking your number.

425
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:26,122
The fact that we met again like this...

426
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:28,093
makes me think we may be meant to be.

427
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,633
I'm sorry, but I'm busy at the moment.

428
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:32,963
I'm a busy guy too.

429
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:34,932
I'm getting all anxious thinking that I may lose...

430
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:36,432
another chance to get your number.

431
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:45,713
(Kim Mi So)

432
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:48,713
Bye now.

433
00:34:58,993 --> 00:35:00,022
What's this?

434
00:35:00,193 --> 00:35:01,633
This number looks made up.

435
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,202
That guy is so tenacious.

436
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:14,312
I would've given him my number if he had been Morpheus.

437
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,613
Sir, here are the burgers and coffee you asked me to pick up.

438
00:35:24,113 --> 00:35:25,923
- I don't want them. - Pardon?

439
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:28,522
You told me to go pick them up for you just a few minutes ago.

440
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,452
I had a change of heart a few seconds ago.

441
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:33,792
All right, then.

442
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:47,542
(Vice Chairman Lee Young Joon)

443
00:35:52,912 --> 00:35:55,252
I didn't know that I had to sit in the meeting as well.

444
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:56,752
It's an emergency situation, you know.

445
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:58,553
Don't make a fool of yourself at the meeting, okay?

446
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:00,252
You have to be on your best behavior.

447
00:36:00,252 --> 00:36:01,593
Okay, I'll be careful.

448
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:04,923
My heart is racing because I'm worried I might make a mistake.

449
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:07,463
My gosh, my heart is racing too.

450
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:09,133
Sorry?

451
00:36:14,832 --> 00:36:17,432
My gosh, Mr. Ko looks very tired.

452
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:19,803
Is he stressed out about work these days?

453
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,843
Oh, right. Didn't you say that he's a total workaholic?

454
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,713
Yes, don't even get me started.

455
00:36:26,582 --> 00:36:29,213
Mr. Ko, would you like to have coffee with me?

456
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,452
It'll perk us up.

457
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:35,122
I think that working is the best kind of perk-me-up.

458
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,723
Nothing stimulates...

459
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:39,062
my brain more than a new task does.

460
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:40,892
Okay?

461
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:43,593
Guys, let's go out for drinks tonight.

462
00:36:43,593 --> 00:36:44,732
It'll help us de-stress.

463
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:46,602
- That'd be great! - Are you in, Mr. Ko?

464
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,403
I relieve my stress through working, not through drinking.

465
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:52,202
Nothing stresses me more...

466
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:54,343
than not completing everything on my task list for the day.

467
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:57,783
Oh, my goodness. I have huge respect for him.

468
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:00,082
Wait, there's more.

469
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:05,082
I heard that he bought 10 of the exact same suit...

470
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:06,582
and wears nothing else...

471
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,423
because he'd much rather get work done...

472
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:11,863
in the time he has to decide what to wear.

473
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:14,022
That's so impressive.

474
00:37:15,263 --> 00:37:16,562
I wish he were...

475
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:19,102
obsessed with me instead of work.

476
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:22,533
Gosh, who's calling? Hey, Kyung Moon.

477
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:35,952
Excuse me, you have something on your...

478
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:44,522
Son!

479
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:51,502
You said you'd be back next week. Why are you back so early?

480
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,332
You return home after three years abroad.

481
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:54,772
Of course, I had to rush back.

482
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:57,232
My, you've gotten even more handsome.

483
00:37:57,602 --> 00:38:00,343
Look who's talking. You've gotten even more beautiful, Mom.

484
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:02,772
She'd better.

485
00:38:02,872 --> 00:38:04,912
She's spent a ton of money.

486
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:08,713
Honey, look.

487
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:11,653
Only those who were born with good looks benefit from such procedures.

488
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:15,053
A face like yours can't be helped even if we spend all of your money.

489
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,562
Oh, right. Have you had a chance to see Young Joon yet?

490
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:22,062
Yes, he still hates me.

491
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:23,792
Gosh, he doesn't hate you.

492
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,562
He's just not a friendly guy, you know.

493
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:28,702
I don't think he wants to be friendly with me.

494
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,973
He's a lot better than me in a lot of ways.

495
00:38:44,082 --> 00:38:45,283
Kim Mi So speaking.

496
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:47,252
I'm calling back because of the note you left.

497
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,352
This is Morpheus' agency.

498
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:50,852
- Oh, yes. - I'm sorry,

499
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:54,162
but he's not interested in public activities of any kind.

500
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:58,102
Could you still pass our proposal along to him?

501
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:03,173
That's too bad. Okay, thank you.

502
00:39:27,662 --> 00:39:30,392
Ms. Kim, how about Italian food for lunch?

503
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:32,062
I'm sorry,

504
00:39:32,062 --> 00:39:34,573
but I'm quite busy today with the opening event for the library.

505
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:38,403
I never asked you to eat with me.

506
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:41,042
I just wanted to tell you to go for Italian food if you feel like it...

507
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,443
and put it on the company credit card.

508
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:45,312
Thank you, sir.

509
00:39:47,283 --> 00:39:48,352
Take it easy.

510
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:10,533
Have I interviewed Morpheus? Yes, last year.

511
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,702
Was it an in-person interview?

512
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,202
No, it was done via e-mail.

513
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:17,812
I e-mailed him the interview questions, and he sent his answers.

514
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:20,243
Then would I be able to get his e-mail address?

515
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:23,613
No, absolutely not.

516
00:40:23,912 --> 00:40:26,223
I promised him that I'd never give away his e-mail address.

517
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:29,122
I must keep my promise to him...

518
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,723
because I have good manners.

519
00:40:32,162 --> 00:40:33,392
You understand, right?

520
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:38,702
Yes, of course.

521
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:41,673
But...

522
00:40:42,803 --> 00:40:46,443
remember how you almost got sued for digging into my boss' personal life?

523
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:50,042
I helped you sort it out so that it wouldn't turn into a legal battle.

524
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,213
You haven't forgotten, right?

525
00:40:53,713 --> 00:40:56,752
- Sorry? - Those with good manners...

526
00:40:57,482 --> 00:40:58,982
always repay the kindness they received.

527
00:40:59,823 --> 00:41:02,193
You understand, right?

528
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:03,892
Yes.

529
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:07,662
Where did I write down his e-mail address?

530
00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:10,432
There it is.

531
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:18,502
It's just his name. I could've figured out this e-mail address.

532
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:24,542
All right, shall I put my skills to use now?

533
00:41:30,213 --> 00:41:32,883
(I'm Yumyung Group Vice Chairman's Secretary, Kim Mi So)

534
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,653
Wonderful.

535
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:42,932
Do you like the whiskey I chose?

536
00:41:43,432 --> 00:41:46,403
No, I like the reflection of my face on the glass.

537
00:41:48,303 --> 00:41:49,372
Admire it all you want.

538
00:41:50,303 --> 00:41:53,002
I heard you've decided to expedite the grand opening of the art center.

539
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:57,272
How do you stay so driven?

540
00:41:58,982 --> 00:42:02,113
That happened when I was away on a work trip,

541
00:42:02,113 --> 00:42:03,752
and I heard there was a power outage too.

542
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:06,752
- It must've been stressful for you. - "Stressful"?

543
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:35,613
No, it was actually fun.

544
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:38,783
It was fun?

545
00:42:41,752 --> 00:42:42,852
Well...

546
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:46,093
I don't think there will be another power outage at the art center.

547
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:49,662
I'll make sure it never happens again.

548
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:51,732
You trust me, right?

549
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:53,332
Thanks.

550
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:08,053
Do it properly, please.

551
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,923
Why does everything get cropped when you photocopy documents?

552
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,522
Because of you, I'm about to...

553
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,832
It's all right.

554
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:25,102
Don't hesitate to tell me if anything stresses you out, Ji Ah.

555
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,502
- Here. - Oh, yes.

556
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,343
It's the presentation for the opening event proposal.

557
00:43:31,602 --> 00:43:33,173
Yes, I'll take it.

558
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:35,973
I'll make sure Ms. Kim gets this.

559
00:43:36,743 --> 00:43:37,843
Thank you.

560
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:46,522
My gosh, Mr. Ko...

561
00:43:46,522 --> 00:43:48,593
looks even more handsome in the morning.

562
00:43:49,622 --> 00:43:52,792
By the way, I heard that he has 10 of the exact same suit...

563
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:55,432
and wears a different one every day. Is it really true?

564
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:56,963
That's what I heard too.

565
00:43:56,963 --> 00:43:59,102
He'd rather get more work done than worry about what to wear.

566
00:43:59,162 --> 00:44:00,662
I don't think it's true.

567
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:04,473
I think he's wearing the suit he wore yesterday.

568
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,042
- The same grain of rice... - Hey! How dare you bad-mouth him.

569
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:09,412
Shall I teach you a lesson?

570
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:11,182
I'm sorry.

571
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,783
Get back to work.

572
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,792
Move out of my way, will you?

573
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:43,673
This is the planning department's proposal for the opening event, sir.

574
00:44:50,883 --> 00:44:52,622
There's nothing new or moving.

575
00:44:53,153 --> 00:44:55,392
Any updates on the book concert idea you mentioned?

576
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,392
I'm still looking into it. I'm sorry, sir.

577
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:07,432
Sir, please pardon my reach. I'll fix your tie for you.

578
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,323
It's okay. Today, I'll just do it.

579
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:28,193
Oh, sure.

580
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:40,932
- Please excuse me for a moment. - Sure.

581
00:45:51,142 --> 00:45:52,883
What's wrong with my heart?

582
00:45:56,852 --> 00:45:58,723
I should see my doctor soon.

583
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:00,522
There must be something wrong with my heart.

584
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:09,263
Ms. Kim, I'm sorry if I asked you to meet me on a busy day.

585
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:12,463
No, please don't worry. Why did you want to see me, ma'am?

586
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,133
I wanted to give this to you.

587
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:18,343
Here. It's for you.

588
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:22,312
- Ma'am, you didn't have to... - Just take it.

589
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:24,412
I bought it while I was out shopping for myself.

590
00:46:25,843 --> 00:46:28,553
By the way, is Young Joon...

591
00:46:29,082 --> 00:46:30,252
very busy today?

592
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:34,723
He's quite busy as the art center will open earlier than expected.

593
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:38,022
Then he's probably not in the greatest mood.

594
00:46:38,122 --> 00:46:41,292
If I ask him to have dinner with me this evening,

595
00:46:41,392 --> 00:46:43,232
he might get annoyed with me, right?

596
00:46:45,363 --> 00:46:47,263
No, that should be fine.

597
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:50,573
And he's free this evening.

598
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:51,702
Really?

599
00:46:54,372 --> 00:46:56,343
Are you heading home, ma'am? Shall I get the car ready?

600
00:46:56,443 --> 00:46:57,513
No.

601
00:46:58,013 --> 00:47:02,013
Judging from what you just told me, I think I can go see Young Joon now.

602
00:47:02,013 --> 00:47:03,252
Thanks, Ms. Kim.

603
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,593
Well... Young Joon.

604
00:47:16,332 --> 00:47:17,803
How about...

605
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:21,403
our entire family gathers for dinner this evening?

606
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:23,702
- I can't. - Why not?

607
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:27,202
Ms. Kim said that you have nothing planned for this evening.

608
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:30,213
Did you meet up with her again?

609
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:32,283
I asked her to meet me because I had a gift for her.

610
00:47:33,982 --> 00:47:35,383
I'm jealous of Ms. Kim.

611
00:47:35,912 --> 00:47:38,653
She got a gift. I want a gift too.

612
00:47:42,723 --> 00:47:46,292
Young Joon, can you give me a gift I want?

613
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,593
I'd love our entire family, including you,

614
00:47:48,593 --> 00:47:50,493
- to have dinner... - No, I can't do that.

615
00:47:51,832 --> 00:47:55,033
You see, I know that I don't look my age,

616
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:56,332
but I'm getting old now.

617
00:47:57,073 --> 00:47:59,042
You and Sung Yeon are the only children I have,

618
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,973
and yet our family rarely spends time together as he lives abroad.

619
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:07,082
I wonder how many more times we'll gather in one place before I die.

620
00:48:10,653 --> 00:48:14,593
Let's have dinner together, okay? Please, Young Joon.

621
00:48:16,653 --> 00:48:17,763
I'm sorry.

622
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,903
- Did the talk not go well? - No.

623
00:48:29,832 --> 00:48:33,702
It's not an occasion he's excited about.

624
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:37,173
It's not like he'll change his mind if I try to persuade him.

625
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:39,943
I have no choice.

626
00:48:47,022 --> 00:48:49,352
My gosh, I just noticed...

627
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:51,522
that my shoes are covered in dust.

628
00:48:51,522 --> 00:48:53,223
Would you like something to wipe them with?

629
00:48:58,332 --> 00:48:59,432
Here...

630
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:08,142
Where did she go without her purse?

631
00:49:14,013 --> 00:49:15,752
Yes, ma'am. You left your purse here...

632
00:49:17,653 --> 00:49:18,752
Pardon me?

633
00:49:18,752 --> 00:49:21,723
I know. Please tell Young Joon...

634
00:49:22,022 --> 00:49:25,562
to bring it home this evening.

635
00:49:26,892 --> 00:49:28,432
Yes, ma'am. I will.

636
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:29,932
Bye-bye.

637
00:49:41,113 --> 00:49:42,673
Have Mr. Yang drop it off.

638
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:44,383
I can't do that, sir.

639
00:49:44,513 --> 00:49:47,883
Ms. Choi told me to make sure that you bring it.

640
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:50,852
Who's your boss?

641
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,682
Does what my mother wants matter more to you?

642
00:49:52,783 --> 00:49:53,823
No. Of course not, sir.

643
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:55,522
You are more important to me.

644
00:49:58,993 --> 00:50:00,792
That's why I am telling you this.

645
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:03,432
You are bothered because of your mother.

646
00:50:03,693 --> 00:50:06,463
I don't know why you are being so stubborn.

647
00:50:06,832 --> 00:50:09,102
But don't do something you will regret.

648
00:50:09,432 --> 00:50:10,432
I'll go now.

649
00:50:35,093 --> 00:50:36,332
Eat this too.

650
00:50:36,662 --> 00:50:38,363
I am okay.

651
00:50:38,363 --> 00:50:41,332
Don't tell me you are going to say something cliche like,

652
00:50:41,332 --> 00:50:42,803
"I feel full when I watch you eat."

653
00:50:42,803 --> 00:50:46,602
No. No. Your mother is on a diet these days.

654
00:50:46,903 --> 00:50:50,243
She eats very little in the evening.

655
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:52,082
Yes.

656
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,513
You can't maintain this shape without hard work.

657
00:51:03,153 --> 00:51:07,122
Young Joon. I should've invited Mi So too. Right?

658
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:09,133
- Mi So? - Yes.

659
00:51:09,392 --> 00:51:10,963
She's Young Joon's secretary.

660
00:51:11,162 --> 00:51:13,533
She's the only person...

661
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:15,732
Young Joon trusts and relies on.

662
00:51:15,903 --> 00:51:17,772
I am so thankful and glad...

663
00:51:17,772 --> 00:51:20,102
that she's keeping his side.

664
00:51:20,102 --> 00:51:22,213
Even her name is pretty.

665
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,743
She's got a pretty face too.

666
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:25,883
Before you go back, let's invite her here...

667
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:27,513
- and have a meal. - You were informed that...

668
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:30,713
we are opening the art center earlier than the schedule. Right?

669
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,923
Yes. Yes. I heard you decided it because of UK Group.

670
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:35,522
Well done.

671
00:51:35,522 --> 00:51:38,693
You got the competitive spirit from me.

672
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,993
But if you suddenly move it up,

673
00:51:40,993 --> 00:51:43,133
wouldn't you have too much to worry about?

674
00:51:43,662 --> 00:51:45,763
I am worried that you will get too tired.

675
00:51:45,763 --> 00:51:47,502
Yes. Take good care of yourself.

676
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,872
Your health is everything to our company.

677
00:51:50,872 --> 00:51:52,173
Yes. Don't worry.

678
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,642
Try this too, honey.

679
00:51:55,642 --> 00:51:56,812
Why do you only eat rice? Here.

680
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:59,542
Try this galbi. It's delicious.

681
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:14,963
Drink your coffee.

682
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:18,133
Later. I'm working right now.

683
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:23,633
By the way, your secretary...

684
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:26,372
I am really curious about her.

685
00:52:27,243 --> 00:52:30,013
How could she manage herself for nine years to work with you.

686
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,582
What is she like?

687
00:52:35,383 --> 00:52:38,582
Because you continue to keep her away from me,

688
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,553
it almost seems like you are intentionally hiding her from me.

689
00:52:45,093 --> 00:52:47,732
Why? Are you afraid that I'm going to go out with her...

690
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,602
when I meet her?

691
00:52:53,263 --> 00:52:54,303
Get out.

692
00:52:57,303 --> 00:52:59,002
I really can't understand you.

693
00:53:02,173 --> 00:53:04,173
I am reaching out my hands and trying my best here.

694
00:53:04,443 --> 00:53:06,312
Shouldn't you feel thankful?

695
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:09,383
Why do I have to feel thankful to you?

696
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:13,082
You are still selfish.

697
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:15,423
Don't you know why?

698
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,223
I said I am forgiving you.

699
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:21,533
I am willing to put the past behind...

700
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,463
and pretend nothing happened.

701
00:53:31,002 --> 00:53:32,973
For someone who is willing to forgive me,

702
00:53:33,173 --> 00:53:34,912
don't you think you are rubbing it in too much?

703
00:53:37,573 --> 00:53:39,142
It's something I don't even remember,

704
00:53:39,682 --> 00:53:41,852
which happened more than 20 years ago.

705
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:47,352
Young Joon.

706
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,493
Why do you hate me so much?

707
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:54,463
I don't hate you.

708
00:53:54,892 --> 00:53:55,963
I just...

709
00:53:57,332 --> 00:53:58,562
abhor you.

710
00:54:05,102 --> 00:54:06,542
Don't be insensitive.

711
00:54:07,602 --> 00:54:09,443
If it weren't for what you did,

712
00:54:09,443 --> 00:54:11,513
I would be in your place.

713
00:54:18,582 --> 00:54:20,153
Do you really think that?

714
00:54:20,582 --> 00:54:21,723
What?

715
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,463
You are weak and incompetent.

716
00:54:27,122 --> 00:54:29,093
To protect yourself,

717
00:54:29,093 --> 00:54:31,332
you torture other people.

718
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:34,872
Even if that didn't happen,

719
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:37,743
you would've never made it this far.

720
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:43,642
You jerk!

721
00:54:52,352 --> 00:54:53,952
What are you doing right now?

722
00:54:54,283 --> 00:54:55,622
Break it off.

723
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:01,162
Stop. Please stop.

724
00:55:01,892 --> 00:55:03,432
Stop.

725
00:55:03,832 --> 00:55:06,303
Please stop.

726
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,113
Stop.

727
00:55:53,113 --> 00:55:54,182
Yes?

728
00:55:54,182 --> 00:55:57,752
I send the publication promotion proposal to your email.

729
00:55:58,082 --> 00:56:00,383
It's urgent, so you should check it right away.

730
00:56:00,622 --> 00:56:02,452
Okay. I will.

731
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,973
(Promotion proposal)

732
00:56:18,602 --> 00:56:21,372
(Kim Mi So, Secretary to Yumyung Group's Vice Chairman)

733
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:01,936
My gosh!

734
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
Mr. Lee.

735
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,019
What were you thinking so deeply about...

736
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:07,760
to not even see the person right in front of you?

737
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,630
What brings you here, Mr. Lee?

738
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:15,070
All the eggs except for one are broken.

739
00:58:15,169 --> 00:58:16,470
Why did you just show up...

740
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,099
What's wrong with your face?

741
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:23,410
It's nothing.

742
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,140
Aren't you coming from your parents' house?

743
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,809
- Did something happen on the way? - I am coming from home.

744
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:29,910
- Don't ask me more. - Let's disinfect it first.

745
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,019
Otherwise, you might end up with a scar.

746
00:58:45,229 --> 00:58:48,269
Wait. Give m 30 seconds. No, 1 minute.

747
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:18,399
30 seconds?

748
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:20,660
Mr. Lee.

749
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:32,709
My place is a little shabby, isn't it?

750
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,880
No.

751
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:38,950
It's very shabby.

752
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,149
Come in.

753
01:00:02,209 --> 01:00:03,369
It's all right.

754
01:00:03,709 --> 01:00:05,280
It's not okay for me.

755
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,610
There are so many occasions where you have to take photos.

756
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,880
If something goes wrong, people will blame me. You know?

757
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:11,579
Follow me.

758
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,099
I am sorry, but can you come a little closer?

759
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:33,260
Don't put a bandage on my face.

760
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:37,030
You don't think a disposable bandage suits my face, do you?

761
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:39,800
I won't put it then.

762
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,110
By the way, how did you get hurt?

763
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,510
It doesn't seem like a wound you just get.

764
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:53,380
Did you get into a fight with someone?

765
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,959
Didn't I tell you not to ask further questions?

766
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:04,760
I am sorry. I wasn't aware of it.

767
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:11,399
Do you...

768
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,439
want to stay for some noodles?

769
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:18,479
Noodles?

770
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,050
When you are feeling down,

771
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:22,809
one bowl of spicy noodles...

772
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:24,680
instantly lifts your mood.

773
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,189
I will put the one egg that didn't break...

774
01:02:28,189 --> 01:02:30,249
in yours.

775
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:11,760
(I hate Senior Managing Director Lee.)

776
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:16,099
Homework. Memorize this with your life.

777
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:17,399
I hate Senior Managing Director Lee.

778
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,010
("Every Moment Was You")

779
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,249
This corny book is here too.

780
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,149
What do you know?

781
01:03:33,149 --> 01:03:34,450
You don't even know love.

782
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,990
Do you know love then?

783
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:43,660
You've been single all your life.

784
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,399
I've read a lot about it in books.

785
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,369
That's great.

786
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,700
The water must be boiling.

787
01:03:57,579 --> 01:03:59,479
Why is he lying face down?

788
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,110
No! No! Don't do that!

789
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,820
Just for a little while.

790
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,419
Let me stay like this for a little while.

791
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,700
From now on, I am going to be madly in love...

792
01:04:57,899 --> 01:04:58,999
with you.

793
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,039
(Thank you Lee Do Yeun for your special appearance.)

794
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:39,180
(What's Wrong with Secretary Kim)

795
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,849
- Date? - Yes.

796
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,950
The fact that she asked you to stay for noodles means...

797
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:46,280
It's like saying, "When you eat the noodles..."

798
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,550
Thank you for the noodles.

799
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,689
"you will go out with me."

800
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:52,320
- Who is he? - Is he your date?

801
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,959
You are very sensitive because you are a writer.

802
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,999
Which restaurant is popular these days?

803
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:00,160
To say I love you...

804
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,729
Ms. Kim, congratulations.

805
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,039
When did this happen?

806
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,709
Just don't do it.
