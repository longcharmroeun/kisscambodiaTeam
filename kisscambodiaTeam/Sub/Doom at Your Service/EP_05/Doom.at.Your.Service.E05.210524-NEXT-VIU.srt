1
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,029
(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

2
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:18,794
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:21,993
The reason behind everything that disappears.

4
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:23,463
"I am the first and the last,"

5
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:24,862
"the beginning and the end."

6
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:27,058
- It's risky? - I'm that.

7
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:28,162
Will I die?

8
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,257
The last. The end.

9
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:33,040
The deity that makes everything vanish.

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,842
I want everything destroyed!

11
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:37,037
Just bring doom to this world!

12
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:40,011
- Hello. - Who are you?

13
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:41,912
- Myul Mang. - What do you want?

14
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:43,882
We don't have time. You're going to die soon.

15
00:00:43,882 --> 00:00:45,246
Exactly 100 days later.

16
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:49,017
You're not scared of things you can't see.

17
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:51,522
But once they become visible,

18
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:54,456
your fear suddenly becomes real.

19
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:01,967
Stop!

20
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:03,426
Stop it!

21
00:01:03,872 --> 00:01:05,166
And just like that,

22
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:09,266
I held Myul Mang's hand.

23
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:10,936
Why me?

24
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:13,642
Why? Why must it be me?

25
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:14,746
Fate.

26
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,647
This won't do. Let's live together.

27
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:19,216
Sure.

28
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:23,222
The terms are...

29
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:24,821
I have to ask you...

30
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:27,832
to destroy the world before I die.

31
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:28,957
What are you doing?

32
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:31,201
Instilling fear.

33
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,397
Get out.

34
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,166
During the period of our contract, my last 100 days,

35
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,697
I will not feel any pain.

36
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:38,936
I've seen you before.

37
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:46,142
You were crying that day.

38
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:49,477
You have to grant me a real wish.

39
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:53,552
Beings like you usually pity humans.

40
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:55,317
Especially humans like me.

41
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:58,957
If I violate the terms of the contract...

42
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:01,787
I've been too nice for no reason.

43
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:02,931
The person I love the most...

44
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,496
I need your hand. Give me your hand!

45
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:06,656
Is that your wish?

46
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:11,136
In the world will die...

47
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:13,967
Then, this is my plan.

48
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:15,271
At that very moment.

49
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,206
My plan is to love you.

50
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:19,782
Then, I'll be able to live...

51
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:20,812
(Doom, person I love the most)

52
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,347
Without losing anything.

53
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:23,747
You can't love me.

54
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,477
No human has ever loved me before.

55
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:29,287
Die!

56
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,257
Everyone either resents me or just wants me.

57
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:35,356
But no one can love me.

58
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,467
Can someone call this in?

59
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,236
Your hand...

60
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,877
Let go. Let go!

61
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:02,187
Don't move.

62
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:13,296
- What just happened? - Don't look.

63
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:15,727
It's not even worth it.

64
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,597
Don't move. Stop!

65
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:21,266
Get away from me!

66
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,146
I'll give back...

67
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:39,687
what I took from you.

68
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,437
I told you.

69
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:02,206
It's impossible to love me.

70
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:12,956
Everyone either resents me or wants me.

71
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,527
Or...

72
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:19,026
some fear me.

73
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:56,726
(Episode 5)

74
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,737
Are you crazy? Why would you grab that with your bare hand?

75
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,036
That healed quickly.

76
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:09,507
What's with you?

77
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,617
What's wrong with you?

78
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,447
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

79
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,917
Come this way.

80
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:20,057
Out of the way.

81
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,826
- Let's go. - Didn't others get injured?

82
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:32,702
- "Others"? - The people he attacked.

83
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:33,797
A man and woman.

84
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:36,007
"A man and woman"?

85
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,276
Whom are you talking about?

86
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,447
What do you mean?

87
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:42,747
What?

88
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,276
Did I say something just now?

89
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:53,117
I thought you wanted me to die.

90
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,162
But you said you can't die.

91
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,586
If you knew that, why did you jump in front of me?

92
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:00,197
Maybe I should've just left you to get stabbed.

93
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,326
That would've taught you a lesson.

94
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:04,371
It would've taught you that you could die by getting involved.

95
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,902
So what if you can't die?

96
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:07,867
You're still bleeding like crazy.

97
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,352
What am I supposed to say when you ask me why I did that...

98
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:17,776
with that heartbroken face of yours?

99
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:20,346
I was worried it might hurt you even more.

100
00:06:21,491 --> 00:06:23,886
- I'm not the one who's sick. - Yes, I know. It's me.

101
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,357
I'm glad you know that.

102
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:27,557
So stop yelling at me.

103
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:29,191
When someone's sick, you don't get angry at them,

104
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,226
which is why I'm trying not to get angry at you.

105
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,127
Are you seriously telling me you're not angry right now?

106
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:42,466
Forget it. Let's drop it.

107
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:45,636
I don't even know why I'm talking to you right now.

108
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:47,276
I did it because I wanted to.

109
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,716
That's all.

110
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:58,386
I want to know why.

111
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:01,627
You asked me...

112
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:05,357
why I need to live.

113
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:08,771
I thought about it, and I couldn't think of a reason.

114
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:10,427
I just want to live.

115
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,237
It's similar to that. There was no specific reason.

116
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:16,737
I just instantly found myself standing in front of you.

117
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,276
You're right. I should've known better.

118
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:22,447
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:26,247
I'm glad you know that.

120
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,687
But I don't regret it.

121
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:40,497
So...

122
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:43,867
just thank me for what I did.

123
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:57,507
The guy from earlier is going to die.

124
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,247
You saw how I killed him.

125
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,417
So don't sacrifice yourself for me...

126
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:08,187
for no specific reason.

127
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:10,427
I'm just not worth it.

128
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,156
I'm sure...

129
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:14,867
you did it for a reason.

130
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:18,466
You're that kind of being.

131
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,206
Dong Kyung!

132
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:34,116
Hey. Sun Kyung.

133
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,620
Hey, what...

134
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:37,346
What's the matter?

135
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,161
He knows you're going to die.

136
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:41,527
Hey, calm down.

137
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:44,256
Blood?

138
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:46,897
What's that blood?

139
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:49,096
Is it that bad already?

140
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:52,437
- No... - Dong Kyung!

141
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,736
I'm sorry!

142
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:59,807
I should've been a better brother!

143
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,787
How did you find out?

144
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:14,216
Why is that important? That's not important right now.

145
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:16,577
What's important is...

146
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,781
that I saw you covered in blood.

147
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:23,016
It wasn't mine. It just happened to get on my clothes.

148
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:28,661
Will you stop crying?

149
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:30,656
How can I stop crying?

150
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:33,992
You're... You're not well.

151
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:36,102
So how can I stop crying?

152
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:38,071
Because I'm terminally ill?

153
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:41,737
Please don't say that.

154
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:46,937
What happened to your leg?

155
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,077
- Take a right. - I know.

156
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:56,847
My leg isn't important.

157
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,722
If I could help you get better,

158
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,317
I'd willingly sacrifice my leg.

159
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,556
I know I'm dying soon, but your leg still matters.

160
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,026
Because it's covered in blood.

161
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:13,296
Yes, because it's covered in blood.

162
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:15,772
What do you mean you know you're dying soon?

163
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:18,237
How could you say that?

164
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:22,577
You should get hospitalized. Turn the car around.

165
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,707
Turn the car around.

166
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:26,847
I can't focus on driving because you're so loud.

167
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,222
If you keep this up, we'll all die.

168
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:31,886
Will you stop talking about death?

169
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:34,252
- Can't you do something about him? - Do what?

170
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,522
Like erasing his memory or...

171
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:37,717
Is that your wish?

172
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:41,126
Forget it. Why do I bother?

173
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:44,526
I'm a jerk. I deserve to die.

174
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,867
No. Don't talk about dying, you idiot.

175
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:05,447
Did you know my sister was sick?

176
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:10,117
Yes.

177
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:13,126
- Since when? - Since the beginning.

178
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:17,497
I thought you were using her.

179
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,026
My brother.

180
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,497
You're the real deal.

181
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:28,607
Thanks, Brother-in-law.

182
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,747
Will you keep calling him that?

183
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,747
Yes, I will.

184
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:43,286
Live together. You have my blessing.

185
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,786
I will...

186
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,187
allow it.

187
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:50,132
Who are you to allow it?

188
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:51,997
I, Tak Sun Kyung,

189
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,567
root for true love...

190
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:55,896
wholeheartedly.

191
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,906
I know that no matter how tough you act...

192
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,482
No. There's no time for this. I'll go now.

193
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,477
I'll leave her to you now.

194
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:08,006
Where are you going?

195
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:11,117
Just get some sleep.

196
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:12,646
Don't worry about me.

197
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,386
He's the one who's worrying.

198
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:59,097
Hi, Sang Geun.

199
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:02,467
I can't go to the lessons with you.

200
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,006
It's nothing serious.

201
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:11,607
I need to make some money.

202
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:14,747
No.

203
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:19,447
I'll explain... Everything... Later.

204
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:26,156
My poor sister.

205
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:28,626
The poor thing.

206
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,396
I'm the head of the family.

207
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:41,676
I'm her guardian now.

208
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:51,247
(Help wanted)

209
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,327
- Hello... - Are you still...

210
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:04,756
hiring?

211
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:14,737
You're hired.

212
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:16,676
I'm on the scene.

213
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:18,652
The Gusin-dong Murder suspect,

214
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:20,181
Kim, killed himself...

215
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:23,317
in a hospital in Seoul today.

216
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:25,522
Kim, who was being transported to the hospital,

217
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,152
caused a scene in front of the ER...

218
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:28,916
and tried to commit suicide.

219
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,561
He was brought into the OR,

220
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:34,327
but he ended up dying from losing too much blood.

221
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:36,732
On the 23rd of the month...

222
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:39,331
They're not mentioning us at all.

223
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:41,472
Kim attacked people with a weapon...

224
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:43,772
killing Choi and two other people...

225
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:45,941
and critically injuring four.

226
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,411
You haven't turned a single page this entire time.

227
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:52,551
Lee and Park are still in a coma...

228
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,546
and are being treated in the ICU.

229
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:58,886
I was right. That you had a reason.

230
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:01,416
Was it a punishment?

231
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,087
Punishment?

232
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:05,992
("The Black Leaf in My Mouth")

233
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,256
Don't get any ideas. I'm not into that.

234
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:14,026
If you're not into it, is it your life's calling?

235
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,097
How grand.

236
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,937
I couldn't stand the stuff he was doing.

237
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:24,536
You keep saying that.

238
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:29,717
You said that to me too.

239
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:31,916
But he and I can't be the same.

240
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:33,987
How are you different?

241
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:39,386
I don't know. How are we different?

242
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,097
Hey, this isn't...

243
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:59,636
(Ms. Soo Ja, My babies)

244
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:25,434
(Emergency Dispatch)

245
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:38,174
(Building 3, Lower, 5)

246
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,184
(Late night medical care)

247
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:55,033
- Hey. - Move.

248
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:56,793
Die!

249
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,396
Why did you do that?

250
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,825
Why are you here?

251
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,616
I asked why you did that.

252
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:20,816
- What? - Why did you protect her?

253
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:31,296
Because she did it first.

254
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:35,711
Since when did you care about that?

255
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:36,806
Because...

256
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,005
if she dies, I can't end the world.

257
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:44,745
What a great excuse.

258
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,185
- Your hand. - I want to know as well.

259
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,515
Whether that's really it...

260
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:54,386
or if it's something else.

261
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:56,685
Then ask...

262
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,826
which is which.

263
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,826
I want to know too.

264
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:18,245
Is that really how you feel?

265
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,255
Hey.

266
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,731
When did you get here?

267
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:36,165
What did you mean by that?

268
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,801
- What? - So you just wanted to save me.

269
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,695
What did you mean by that?

270
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,636
I just wanted to do that. That's it. It doesn't mean anything.

271
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:52,576
You saved me because if I disappear, you'd die, right?

272
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,846
Is that it?

273
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:56,616
I knew it.

274
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,755
What do you think?

275
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,515
How would I know that?

276
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,255
I can't hear your thoughts because of our deal.

277
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,425
Then, make an effort.

278
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,566
- Make an effort? - Yes.

279
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,235
You can observe me and think about why I did it.

280
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,465
"Why did she do that?"

281
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,265
Why should I do that?

282
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:20,906
Because I do that often.

283
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:28,146
"Why on earth is he like this?"

284
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:32,955
"I see. That's why."

285
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:38,856
It's some kind of skill people need to have in this world.

286
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,495
Right. Can you not do that because you're not human?

287
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:50,235
How do you do that?

288
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:06,056
Over there. Why do you think she's standing over there?

289
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:10,386
She must really want to drink.

290
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,329
She got an arm lift, so she couldn't drink for two weeks.

291
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,430
I see. She can't drink, then.

292
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,870
It might cause an infection.

293
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,396
Until she recovers, she can't... No!

294
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,041
Hey, don't just tell me their thoughts.

295
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,306
Observe someone and think about that person.

296
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,445
What?

297
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,850
I observed you and thought about you.

298
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,945
I got it.

299
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:38,086
You're annoyed at me.

300
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,126
I got it.

301
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,796
You're mad at me.

302
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,136
Good. Nicely done.

303
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:56,136
Hey, Tak Dong Kyung. What were you implying?

304
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:58,211
You weren't being nice, right?

305
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,935
That was sarcasm, right?

306
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,120
By the way, what's your name?

307
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,491
- Why do you ask? - When I get angry,

308
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:12,061
I want to call you by your name.

309
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,485
Only you get to do that.

310
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,491
I don't have a name.

311
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:17,061
Only people need names.

312
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:18,061
Then, be Human.

313
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:20,630
I can't be human. How many times must I remind you...

314
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,731
until you accept that I'm not human?

315
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:24,465
Your name. Your name can be Human.

316
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,340
What about your last name?

317
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,370
You can be a Kim. That's the most common last name.

318
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,441
Kim Human. That's good. Kim Human.

319
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:32,175
What are you talking about?

320
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:34,106
Hey, Kim Human!

321
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,306
You almost crashed into the cart.

322
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:08,505
Look around before you go.

323
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:12,106
And let go of me now.

324
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,546
I really can't figure you out.

325
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,386
Okay.

326
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,656
- What? - You want me to watch and think.

327
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:29,471
I'll watch you and think.

328
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:32,025
Remember. You were the one who told me to do this.

329
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:42,205
So...

330
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:44,445
he's...

331
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:47,316
Jung Min?

332
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,346
Of course, he is. He's not Joo Ik.

333
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:54,860
Oh, right. He's Jung Min.

334
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,590
Yes, it's Jung Min. I'm sure it's him.

335
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,356
There's Jung Min.

336
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,400
Jung Min, these are the printouts for our meeting.

337
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,425
Sort them and get them in the meeting room.

338
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,136
Have you gone mad? Why are you here?

339
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:11,741
What about Jung Min? Where's Jung Min now?

340
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:14,005
Don't worry. I kept him alive.

341
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,275
How could you say that? Come on!

342
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,915
Yes. I'm coming.

343
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,826
You know how to do this, right?

344
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,386
No.

345
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,796
That was a joke.

346
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:53,546
If Young Prince causes trouble again, we can't handle it then.

347
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,890
We had to cut a deal with the platform for this huge event.

348
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,245
- So make sure to stay on top of it. - Okay.

349
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,515
And did you meet with Lee Hyun?

350
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,126
- Pardon? - Did you see her after that?

351
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,660
After when? I'm not sure what you're referring to.

352
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,461
After you and I talked about that kiss.

353
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:10,425
What? No. I didn't see her after that.

354
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:12,935
I'm not the type to gossip about other people's private stuff.

355
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,366
Why not?

356
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:15,836
What?

357
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,580
I want a proposal and overall review of all of her novels...

358
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,311
from the first one to the recent one by the end of today.

359
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,580
Why do you need that all of a sudden?

360
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,775
That's it.

361
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:27,876
Are you dating Jung Min?

362
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:29,521
Me? Why would I?

363
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:30,685
No, right?

364
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:33,386
Did you cross him or something?

365
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,761
What?

366
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:37,485
He's been staring at you the whole time.

367
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:47,536
Come on.

368
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,086
I'm bleeding.

369
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,556
I was working.

370
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,396
Gosh. What a dangerous job you have.

371
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:21,235
Is your finger a document?

372
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:30,906
All good, right?

373
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:32,945
Why did you put that on?

374
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,480
Because it's bleeding.

375
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:36,386
It probably stopped before you put it on.

376
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,056
You don't think I don't know that?

377
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,120
It's like a comforting ritual.

378
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,626
It's recognizing your pain. It doesn't mean anything.

379
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,126
You said that again.

380

381
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,515
Ms. Tak.

382
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:09,985
What is it this time?

383
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,185
How do I do this?

384
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,685
- What's "this"? - Printing.

385
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:24,170
If you don't even know how to do that, why are you here?

386
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,326
You think I can't do this?

387
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,235
What?

388
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,336
I just wanted to do it. It didn't mean anything.

389
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,745
No.

390
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:43,415
It's not what you think.

391
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,786
No. It's not what you think at all.

392
00:27:46,191 --> 00:27:47,415
That's not it.

393

No!

394
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,826
I said, no.

395
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,566
Hello.

396
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,205
Please sit there, Mr. Cha.

397
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,546
I like sitting here.

398

Why don't you sit here?

399
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:20,915
Just sit there.

400
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:22,626
Okay.

401
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:31,701
Jjamppong or jjajangmyeon. That is the question.

402
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:34,140
I need to cure a hangover. I'll get jjamppong.

403
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,265
It sounds like you drink so you could have jjamppong.

I'm too scared to say anything in front of you now.

408

You took it literally...

409
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,796
when I told you to observe and think.

410

No.

415
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,051
She's getting off at this station.

416
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:17,346
Really?

417
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,515
The train is approaching the station.

418

421
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,525
on my way home after I got a job here.

422
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,765
I observed you and thought about how you might feel.

423
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:45,265
You seemed tired,

424
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,606
and I figured you might want to sit.

425
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:51,606
I'm so touched. You're...

426
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,675
pretty much human now.

427
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,636

428
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,935
There are.

429
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:22,340
Then go and sit down.

430
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,775
- I don't need to. - Why not?

431
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:25,646
Because I need to stand here and observe you.

432
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:40,525
Go ahead and observe me all you want.

433
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,695
I also need to read something.

434
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:46,296
Yes, I'm already observing you all I want.

00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:22,846
You've changed.

501
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,355
What are you looking at?

502
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:31,186
What is this?

503
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,100
"He ran away from love and embarrassment."

504
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,695
"That's how he chose to end their love."

505
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,800
(Fine. Let's break up.)

506
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,465
This guy is a piece of trash.

507
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,375
Why is she still having a hard time getting over this jerk?

508
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:51,746
I know, right? I wonder what she liked so much about him.

509
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:03,755
(I hate it when you're like this.)

510
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:05,861

(Favorites)

514
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:20,875
Who did this?

515
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:23,751
You'd better make sure Young Prince doesn't stop writing.

516
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:26,045
How are we going to make money if he stops writing?

517
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:28,080
We don't even have that many famous writers.

518
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,045
Why couldn't you keep things in check?

519
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,390
How could you make a mess just because I'm not there?

520
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,720
Who did this? Who uploaded it wrong?

521
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,156
Who was it? Who did it?

522
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,056
Why aren't you guys talking?

523
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,100
Do you all want to get fired?

524
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,996
Do you think I won't do it?

525
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,795
Jung Min, I just saw you glancing somewhere else.

526
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,906
Da In, was it you?

527
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:55,235
No, it was me.

528
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,645
Tak...

529
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,381
- I'm sorry. - An apology won't cut it!

530
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:04,985
I had to talk to his mom past midnight!

531
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,085
International phone calls are expensive!

532
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,286
Do you know how scary his mom is?

533
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:11,760
You'd better convince him to keep writing.

534
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,096
- If you fail, you'll have to quit. - Okay.

535
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,826
Hey.

536
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,795
Where are you going?

537
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:20,096
To quit.

538
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:23,565
Are you kidding me?

539
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,806
Go convince Young Prince right now!

540
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:33,815
Gosh, what a pity. This was my chance to quit.

541
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,286
I'm sorry.

542
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:40,616
- I'll take responsibility... - And do what?

543
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:45,231
It's all my fault.

544
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:47,326
Gosh, I shouldn't have ignored it.

545
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,600
- What? - Forget it.

546
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,166
You make mistakes so you can learn from them.

547
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,706
I went through the same thing. I learned from my mistakes.

548
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,875
No, I'm done.

549
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:13,556
I know you're here to ask me to keep writing.

550
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,886
I've been meaning to quit anyway.

551
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:19,125
I should go now.

552
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,695
The school's serving us tonkatsu for lunch today.

553
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,895
Hey, wait.

554
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,771
You came all the way here amid your busy schedule.

555
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:32,565
I feel really bad that you have to leave so early.

556
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:36,550
Exactly.

557
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,050
I wrote that novel amid my busy schedule.

558
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,175
And I'm really upset that you uploaded it that way.

559
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:49,355
I really don't know what to say.

560
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:51,990
How about we eat together...

561
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,631
and talk about it for a little while?

562
00:37:55,631 --> 00:37:57,766
I swear I won't take up too much of your time.

563
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,936
I even brought this to treat you to a nice meal.

564
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,010
Ta-da. This is a company card.

565
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,936
- I'll explain what it is. - I know what it is.

566
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,846
Right.

567
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:13,875
I shouldn't have said that.

568
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:19,585
Can I eat something expensive?

569
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,585
Of course. Just tell me what you want.

570
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,125
Then I'll have...

571
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,536
Yeopgi Tteokbokki.

572
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:41,536
Oh, okay. Sure.

573
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,045
Hello.

574
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:50,416
Hey, what...

575
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,186
What? Were you talking to me?

576
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:58,956
Hey, what a lovely smell! Don't you agree?

577
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:02,596
Hey, I'm going to go home after I eat.

578
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:05,826
I'm not going back to school today.

579
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,941
We'll have one tteokbokki and...

580
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,510
We'll add one udon, two extra servings of cheese,

581
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,841
and a combination of fritters, but change the vegetable fritter...

582
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:16,275
with the seaweed glass noodle roll.

583
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,846
We'll have the spiciest one.

584
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,045
Got it.

585
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,085
"Got it"?

586
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:28,616
Did he just say "Got it"?

587
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:30,186
No.

588
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,726
I think he said, "Yes, sir."

589
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:02,255
What if I give it a terrible ending?

590
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:03,760
Like the earth exploding.

591
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,656
Wow. Talk about a grand finale. That's nice.

592
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,700
The protagonist dies...

593
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,996
A sad ending stays in the hearts of the readers.

594
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,300
It turns out it was all a dream.

595
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,465
The "Inception" of web novels.

596
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,215
- But... - Yes?

597
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,145
It's odd.

598
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:35,186
What is?

599
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:38,461
There are hardly any sausages.

600
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:39,686
Sausages?

601
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:42,395
Here's a sausage.

602
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:50,266
Anyway, It's not that simple.

603
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,136
You may not know since you're not a writer.

604
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:57,145
Yes, of course.

605
00:40:57,481 --> 00:41:00,651
To be completely honest, I don't care about editing.

606
00:41:00,651 --> 00:41:02,881
I just really enjoy your story.

607
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:05,191
It's really fun, so I want to read more of it.

608
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:07,120
It's out of personal selfishness.

609
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,220
Oh no. You can't tell my boss...

610
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,625
that I said that, okay?

611
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,631
May I get an extra order of sausages?

612
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:19,300
Of course. You can order anything you want.

613
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,341
Excuse me.

614
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:22,465
More sausages and cheese please.

615
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,266
I'm out.

616
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,510
What? Then more dumplings.

617
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,675
I'm out.

618
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,280
Then quail eggs...

619
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,576
- I'm out. - What do you have?

620
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:35,651
Don't you think he's very rude?

621
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:38,389
Sausages? Quail eggs?

622
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,220
If they're out, I'll go buy them myself.

623
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,660
I saw a convenience store next door.

624
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,186
Give me a minute.

625
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:46,895
Is that all right, sir?

626
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,715
Hey, you.

627
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:15,260
Why are you so rude, kid?

628
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,461
All you care about is sausages.

629
00:42:16,461 --> 00:42:18,056
Okay.

630
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:19,886
It must be nice being old.

631
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,260
Don't you like sausages?

632
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,401
Stop talking back to me, runt.

633
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,925
Stop starting fights, old man.

634
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:30,806
Do you want to die?

635
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,505
No. I don't want to die.

636
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,686
That girl will pick up the tab.

637
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:54,695
Sir...

638
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:57,925
Hey. Where did he go?

639
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:05,266
You... Darn it.

640
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:16,815
Sir. Did you get back safely?

641
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,286
I hope I didn't take too much of your time.

642
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,461
I'm terribly sorry about what happened.

643
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:27,326
I'd really appreciate it if you'd consider what I said today.

644
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:32,065
I look forward to hearing back from you.

645
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,941
I get it, so stop texting.

646
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:42,536
I have a mask on right now.

647
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,815
Seriously. You young twerp.

648
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,186
You should've talked like that before.

649
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,315
You don't understand. It's my job.

650
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:54,956
It looked more like you were in prison, not working.

651
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:57,386
- Is he your prison guard? - Pretty much.

652
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:59,326
It is suffocating.

653
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:02,760
Hey. How long have you been following me?

654
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,470
Since the tteokbokki place? Or...

655
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,266
Since the moment you were born.

656
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:15,941
I follow people from the moment they're born.

657
00:44:15,941 --> 00:44:17,775
It's just that you noticed now.

658
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,116
I've completed monitoring you professionally.

659
00:44:24,521 --> 00:44:25,850
I came to monitor you personally,

660
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,315
but it ended up being professional again.

661
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,061
What was the conclusion of your professional monitoring?

662
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:32,826
You should reflect on what you saw.

663
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,525
Why don't you just make a wish and ask for money?

664
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,166
I don't want to hear it if that's your conclusion.

665
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,605
I'm going to use it for a very good cause.

666
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,611
I know it's unfair and annoying,

667
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:48,680
but I'm not the only one living like this.

668
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,976
Does everyone live like that?

669
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,381
Yes, everyone.

670
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:54,116
Everyone has a sob story.

671
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,246
As sad as yours?

672
00:44:56,691 --> 00:44:58,585
I don't know about that,

673
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:01,461
but everyone has their share of sorrow.

674
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:04,525
Everyone has their share of burdens.

675
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:18,666
What are you doing?

676
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:22,706
Your share looked too heavy.

677
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,945
I thought you may want this.

678
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,505
What is this?

679
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,576
Isn't this a dream?

680
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:58,505
It's real. Be careful not to drown.

681
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,145
It's real?

682
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,596
I feel like I can breathe now.

683
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:28,536
I've never told anyone before,

684
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:34,145
but I always sat here like this whenever I wanted to cry...

685
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,916
ever since I was a child.

686
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,715
I came when I missed my mom.

687
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:43,516
I came when I missed my dad.

688
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:46,326
I came when Sun Kyung stressed me out.

689
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,255
I came when I felt guilty toward my aunt.

690
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:51,496
I came just because.

691
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,025
Why?

692
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:55,996
You could've just cried.

693
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,136
Why did you sit here and fight the tears?

694
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,505
I know, right?

695
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,105
I just didn't want anyone to know that I was crying.

696
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:08,616
You could've cried alone when no one was looking.

697
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,886
Then no one would know.

698
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:12,686
I'd know.

699
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:15,815
I know.

700
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,156
And I hated that.

701
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:44,686
Why are you suddenly being nice to me?

702
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:46,246
To seduce you.

703
00:47:48,861 --> 00:47:49,956
Just kidding.

704
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,315
Do you want to kiss?

705
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:36,895
I'll pretend I didn't hear that then.

706
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,585
Let's go. It's cold.

707
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:52,445
Okay.

708
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:09,266
It's cold.

709
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,565
Dong Kyung.

710
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:20,875
Yes?

711
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,715
Aren't you going to take them down? They're dry.

712
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,326
Whatever! I won't.

713
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:58,373
I heard Hyun Kyu is coming to the reunion.

714
00:49:59,448 --> 00:50:02,243
Yes. Make me look ten times hotter.

715
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:04,143
No. Make it 30 times.

716
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:06,214
What a loser.

717
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:08,659
He said he was studying after going abroad,

718
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:09,818
so he didn't answer your calls.

719
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:11,083
But he's coming to the reunion?

720
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:13,824
I bet he wasn't even studying. He was busy partying.

721
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:15,924
He posts a lot of photos on social media.

722
00:50:16,198 --> 00:50:18,694
Whenever I think about how he broke up with you...

723
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:21,333
over a text, it still infuriates me.

724
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:22,663
What a scumbag.

725
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:24,663
Nice eyes.

726
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,904
That's the right attitude.

727
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:31,273
I'll make your hair look so great. You just wait.

728
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:43,514
(Mr. Cha Joo Ik)

729
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:48,424
- Yes. - Where are you?

730
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:50,358
Pardon?

731
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:52,123
Let's meet. I need to talk to you.

732
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,293
- Did you call the wrong person? - No.

733
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:57,764
So let's meet now.

734
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,178
(I wanted to share a kiss like we shared glances.)

735
00:51:07,178 --> 00:51:10,944
(Kiss)

736
00:51:19,758 --> 00:51:21,293
Do you think that's enough to break the desk?

737
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:28,534
- Where are you going? - I have a meeting.

738
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:42,643
Please review it. I already reviewed it.

739
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:45,813
What's this?

740
00:51:46,289 --> 00:51:47,384
A proposal?

741
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:49,988
From character selection and development...

742
00:51:49,988 --> 00:51:51,789
to data research, episode outline,

743
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:53,924
plot development, and some hand-holding too.

744
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:56,654
I'll make you get into the top 10.

745
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:57,798
And when you do,

746
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:00,864
I will get five percent of your earnings as my remuneration.

747
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:03,568
I already have a contract with the company.

748
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:06,004
This is between you and me. A personal contract.

749
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,778
I saw potential in you.

750
00:52:08,778 --> 00:52:10,579
Getting into the top 10 isn't easy.

751
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:13,249
Do you think you can agree to and comply with all of my demands?

752
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:14,514
That will be easier, then.

753
00:52:17,919 --> 00:52:19,784
- How can I trust... - Did you do your hair?

754
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:23,154
What?

755
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:25,424
Yes.

756
00:52:26,258 --> 00:52:27,594
I have a school reunion.

757
00:52:28,198 --> 00:52:29,554
Is Lee Hyun Kyu coming too?

758
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:38,663
I guess he is. That's why you did your hair.

759
00:52:42,378 --> 00:52:44,804
- You know... - Don't go to the school reunion.

760
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:47,643
Don't see him.

761
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,643
But you will still go...

762
00:52:51,988 --> 00:52:54,114
and see him no matter what I said, right?

763
00:52:55,659 --> 00:52:57,628
This doesn't concern you.

764
00:52:57,628 --> 00:52:59,289
I read all of your novels.

765
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:00,924
And you need one thing.

766
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:03,853
A new male character.

767
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:06,993
And I'll help you with that.

768
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,568
So don't hold on to him.

769
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:10,663
You know, this isn't...

770
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:13,034
revenge. You just haven't let him go.

771
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:38,663
- Where are you going? - To work.

772
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:41,094
Hey.

773
00:53:43,539 --> 00:53:44,663
What?

774
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:49,373
Let me come with you.

775
00:53:56,678 --> 00:53:59,944
- Buy your wedding box! - Buy your wedding box!

776
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:03,059
- Buy your wedding box! - Buy your wedding box!

777
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:05,088
- My gosh. I'm so tired. - Buy your wedding box.

778
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:07,528
I'm so exhausted. I can't walk anymore.

779
00:54:07,528 --> 00:54:11,898
My goodness. He's too hungry to walk!

780
00:54:11,898 --> 00:54:13,393
- Oh, no. What should we do? - Gosh.

781
00:54:14,968 --> 00:54:17,298
Getting married at the age of 50 isn't something to brag about.

782
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:19,238
Let's make this easy on ourselves.

783
00:54:19,238 --> 00:54:21,738
Take this. Hey, bring the food now!

784
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:22,933
- Get up. - Gosh.

785
00:54:23,278 --> 00:54:25,973
- All right. Hurry. - Let's go.

786
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:28,813
- Buy your wedding box! - Buy your wedding box!

787
00:54:29,718 --> 00:54:33,143
- Buy your wedding box! - Buy your wedding box!

788
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:38,023
- Buy your wedding box! - Buy your wedding box!

789
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:43,594
I've never seen this ceremony before.

790
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:48,433
I didn't know people still did this. I only saw this on TV.

791
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:50,964
It's reaching its end.

792
00:54:52,909 --> 00:54:55,373
Inanimate things end too.

793
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:57,648
Traditions will die too.

794
00:54:57,648 --> 00:54:59,579
All right. Let's go!

795
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:02,773
You won't be able to see things you used to see every day.

796
00:55:04,048 --> 00:55:06,083
And watching such things is my job too.

797
00:55:10,659 --> 00:55:11,924
How beautiful...

798
00:55:13,258 --> 00:55:14,424
and sad.

799
00:55:18,468 --> 00:55:20,793
Most of the things that disappear are beautiful.

800
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:26,234
Do you know what a supernova is?

801
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:31,878
Right before stars vanish from the world,

802
00:55:31,878 --> 00:55:34,203
they shine brightly.

803
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,148
And that explosion creates...

804
00:55:36,148 --> 00:55:38,583
the energy for the new stars in the future.

805
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:40,444
It will become a star again.

806
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:42,718
Maybe, that's what this is.

807
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:45,523
The reason why things disappear and why you are here.

808
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:55,364
Don't comfort me. It won't work.

809
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:11,844
I thought I picked the wrong person.

810
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:16,453
I thought I shouldn't have picked you.

811
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:19,654
That's why I thought I was in this mess.

812
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:25,893
Do you still think so?

813
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:29,764
No.

814
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:32,764
I picked the right person.

815
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:36,574
So I came to this conclusion.

816
00:56:49,488 --> 00:56:50,683
Love me.

817
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:57,623
Love me if you can.

818
00:57:01,468 --> 00:57:03,833
That wouldn't be such a bad idea either.

819
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:05,864
So...

820
00:57:15,548 --> 00:57:17,574
be the first human to love me.

821
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,634
(Doom at Your Service)

822
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:12,864
Be crazy...

823
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:15,534
in life.

824
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:18,473
I brought you flowers this time.

825
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,043
Sleep with me. Please?

826
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:23,174
Sweetie, open it.

827
00:58:23,948 --> 00:58:27,183
Everyone even the kids look down on me!

828
00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:30,083
You should say that you want to fall madly in love.

829
00:58:30,689 --> 00:58:32,924
That's how romance begins.

830
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:35,254
It seems like you've met...

831
