1
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,324
(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

2
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,989
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:28,200
Misfortunes are like unwelcome guests...

4
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:30,133
that they show up out of the blue.

5
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:32,975
They're our family,

6
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,705
so someone in the family should raise them.

7
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,669
It's not like you're going to volunteer.

8
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:38,870
It's not easy to raise someone else's children.

9
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:40,410
She has a point.

10
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,239
They shouldn't grow up walking on eggshells.

11
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,254
Why don't we just send them to an orphanage...

12
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,550
They'll hear you.

13
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:00,389
- What about Soo Ja? - She just got on the flight.

14
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:03,035
She's coming from Jeju Island. So it will take her some time.

15
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:04,730
You think having her here would make any difference?

16
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:06,699
No matter how much she loved her sister,

17
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,899
I doubt that a single woman like her would raise two kids on her own.

18
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:12,410
It will be harder to let them go after getting attached to them.

19
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,369
For the sake of their future,

20
00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:16,715
sending them to an orphanage is the best option.

21
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:18,880
As if! You're only thinking about yourselves, not the kids!

22
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:22,520
Soo Ja...

23
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:24,250
Even good fortunes...

24
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:27,250
don't come to us with a gentle knock.

25
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:49,110
I'm...

26
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:51,414
taking the kids.

27
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:53,715
Gosh. What in the world? You're not even married.

28
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:56,985
She's right. I understand that you care for them deeply.

29
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,349
I'm going to raise them!

30
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:15,400
At times, misery and fortunes come with the same face.

31
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:22,880
And I still have a hard time distinguishing the two.

32
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:32,750
You were the only person who had the same thought at the same time.

33
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:40,090
I'm grateful.

34
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:41,599
In many ways.

35
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,180
Hey.

36
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,590
This won't do.

37
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:12,759
Let's live together.

38
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:14,130
You and me.

39
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:24,039
Which one of the faces are you showing me?

40
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,009
Did you bring me luck...

41
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:30,810
or misery?

42
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:33,650
Or are you...

43
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,079
neither?

44
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,490
Sure.

45
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:46,729
What?

46
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:58,544
Of course, it's misery.

47
00:03:58,544 --> 00:03:59,769
Why even ask?

48
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:10,579
Why did I ask him to live with me there?

49
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:30,600
Let's take it back.

50
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,709
The embarrassment only lasts so long.

51
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:43,120
Hey, I was being absurd earlier...

52
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,874
- What? - I don't mind living together,

53
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:07,639
but I can't stand your place.

54
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,639
What did you just say again? You were being absurd?

55
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:13,885
What? Me? No.

56
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:17,149
I've never once said anything absurd in my entire life.

57
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,290
That's too far stretched.

58
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:22,025
Where's the nearest train station from here?

59
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:24,290
Which neighborhood is this? Which subway line?

60
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:29,029
I'll just take my time to get to know all that.

61
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:36,899
Look at all this alcohol.

62
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,670
Are they expensive?

63
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:42,509
What is this table?

64
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:44,240
Is it expensive?

65
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:48,819
What's this sofa? Is it expensive?

66
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,490
Why do you keep talking to me?

67
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:53,624
Can't you see I'm reading?

68
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:56,690
You're just like me. You only look at me when I pick a fight.

69
00:05:58,595 --> 00:05:59,990
Do you have feelings for me?

70
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,259
What?

71
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,459
- I guess you do. - No, I don't.

72
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:05,534
- Fine. - I really don't.

73
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:07,104
If you really don't, that means you have a problem...

74
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:08,744
considering you asked me to live with you.

75
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,370
I asked you to live with me because you're special.

76
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:15,684
You said I should be more clingy.

77
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:18,009
I'm saying you should be more clingy.

78
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:20,684
To your fate that came to you.

79
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,050
You said this is fate.

80
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:27,519
Something came to my mind as you started walking away.

81
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:32,829
"What if he just disappears without even telling me?"

82
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:35,959
That won't happen.

83
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:40,630
You were nice to me as if you were going to disappear.

84
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:48,110
People who are nice to me always disappear.

85
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:49,409
It was always like that with me.

86
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,285
You say it like you're not even sad about it.

87
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:55,825
What if you don't show up when the clock strikes 12?

88
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:58,250
What if I think of a wish but you don't show up?

89
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,690
That's why I asked you to live with me.

90
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,765
- Fine. - That's why.

91
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:05,529
- I said, fine. - I'm serious.

92
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:09,259
I don't know if I should believe you or not.

93
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:13,303
If I think of a wish... No.

94
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:16,500
If my wish comes true, I'll set you free.

95
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:20,715
I'm not a hostage. I should be saying that to you.

96
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:22,480
Where do you eat?

97
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:24,409
Where do you sleep?

98
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,913
Where's my room? Where should I sleep?

99
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,924
I don't sleep or eat.

100
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:31,690
You don't get your own room. You can sleep...

101
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,589
upstairs wherever.

102
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:37,695
But there are tons of rooms here.

103
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:40,329
But there isn't one for you.

104
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:44,130
Excuse me for looking around.

105
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:12,529
Darn it.

106
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:24,670
- Hey. - I said you don't get a room.

107
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:27,240
Dong Kyung.

108
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,184
What was that? Where is that sound coming from?

109
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:33,679
It's that puppy I saw in front of your place.

110
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,220
- "Puppy"? - Yes.

111
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:39,194
If you think about it, he sort of looks like one.

112
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:41,919
Dong Kyung! Hey! Dong Kyung.

113
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,059
Sun Kyung?

114
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:45,735
How does he know this place?

115
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,265
He's at your place.

116
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,529
What are you talking about?

117
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,899
You'll find out once you go outside.

118
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:06,250
My gosh, he's incredible.

119
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:09,580
Hey, Sun Kyung. Have you been well? Did you eat?

120
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,750
Yes, Aunt Soo Ja.

121
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:13,625
Let me tell you what happened today. Dong Kyung...

122
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,689
I'll kill you if you tell her anything.

123
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,590
She's really nice to me.

124
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:21,164
She's so nice to me, and I'm really happy.

125
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:23,135
I can't live without her.

126
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:26,275
Soo Ja, you look even more beautiful today...

127
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,304
with that sunlight shining over you.

128
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,245
Whatever it was, I'm sure it was your fault, Sun Kyung.

129
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:32,975
What do you mean it was my fault?

130
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:34,574
You're always on her side.

131
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,584
I wired you money.

132
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,444
I love you, Aunt Soo Ja. I'll be a good nephew.

133
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:41,750
I, Tak Sun Kyung, live with a goal to be a good nephew.

134
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:42,954
You punk.

135
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,794
Just be good to your sister. I wired the money to her account.

136
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,054
What? Why?

137
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,995
You're obviously favoring her over me.

138
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:52,535
Why did you wire money?

139
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:54,289
I make my own money.

140
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:56,865
That way, I get to have the right to be an adult and nag at you.

141
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:59,135
If Sun Kyung doesn't behave, you can keep every penny.

142
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,304
Aunt, Dong Kyung is a scrooge.

143
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:03,505
Once she receives money, she never spits it out.

144
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:06,713
Did you just call me a Scrooge? I'm surprised you know that word.

145
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:08,509
I guess your college degree really pays off.

146
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:12,314
Gosh, you guys still behave like little kids.

147
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:15,855
Aunt, he even finished his military service. Look at his dark skin.

148
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:16,954
I don't have dark skin.

149
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:18,594
I have brighter skin than Dong Kyung.

150
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:20,019
I just got tanned. That's all.

151
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,194
I don't think Dong Kyung will give you any money...

152
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,689
judging by how you're behaving.

153
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:25,735
It's nighttime in Korea, isn't it?

154
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:28,659
That's enough arguing, my babies.

155
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:31,105
- Good night. - You too, Aunt.

156
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:33,605
Don't worry. Talk to you next time.

157
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:35,174
Aunt, wait...

158
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,299
(Call ended)

159
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,880
What? What do you want?

160
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,779
"What? What do you want?"

161
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:48,584
You're so brazen.

162
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:50,279
You really are unbelievable.

163
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,889
What did you just say?

164
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,189
Have some respect for your older sister.

165
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,495
Why couldn't you be like this to that jerk?

166
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:59,330
Why are you always so hard on your brother instead?

167
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,759
What did you do to him?

168
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:02,659
Did you beat him up?

169
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,105
Are you worried about that married man?

170
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,105
No, I'm worried about you.

171
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:09,704
I'm worried you might go to jail for messing with that jerk.

172
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:11,939
Don't worry. I took care of him.

173
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,639
The skies helped.

174
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:15,584
- Hey! - Help!

175
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:16,615
Stop right there!

176
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:18,009
Help!

177
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,899
911? I called to report a car accident.

178
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,204
He didn't die.

179
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:42,399
He had amazing reflexes.

180
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,340
It means he was really fast.

181
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,639
But I bet he'll get hospitalized for about eight weeks.

182
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,380
Now that he's out of the way,

183
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,380
where's the other guy?

184
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,320
Why aren't you asking me anything?

185
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:01,625
Why aren't you asking me why I dated a married man?

186
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,059
What's there to ask? It's pretty obvious.

187
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,590
How could you have known that he lied to you?

188
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:08,799
Was he nice to you?

189
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:11,759
You always fall for guys who are nice to you.

190
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:17,899
This is why I told you not all nice people are good.

191
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:20,145
My gosh, you're such a fool.

192
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:22,245
Get out of the way. Where's the other guy hiding?

193
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:24,485
He's home, isn't he? You just wait.

194
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:25,914
Hey! Sun Kyung!

195
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:27,210
Hey, wait.

196
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,855
Hey, wait. No, wait...

197
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:33,125
I'm not going to wait. Tell me where he is right now.

198
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,559
- No, he's not here. - Don't lie to me.

199
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:37,225
He's not here, right?

200
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:39,365
I told you he isn't here. Come on. Let's go.

201
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:40,765
- Get off me! - My gosh.

202
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:43,759
I told you he's not here.

203
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:47,804
Hello, my brother-in-law.

204
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:49,475
He's not your brother-in-law.

205
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:51,275
You really did a great job of hiding him.

206
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:53,110
Look at him lying proudly on your bed.

207
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:55,580
I tried my best.

208
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:57,309
There was nowhere to hide.

209
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,909
Why don't you move to a bigger place, honey?

210
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:02,625
Hey.

211
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,679
Don't call me that. Call me "honey".

212
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:09,689
"Honey"?

213
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,159
No.

214
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:12,990
Honey.

215
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,029
No...

216
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:25,100
So you're telling me you faked it on purpose?

217
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:27,470
You purposely told him you guys were living together?

218
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,285
Yes, exactly.

219
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,985
It was to get rid of him.

220
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:32,509
Stay out of it, Dong Kyung.

221
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,450
He's so calm and relaxed.

222
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,649
That kind of vibe normally comes from money.

223
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,259
How dare he smirk?

224
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:47,990
Let's have a drink.

225
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:50,635
A drink? Why are you suddenly asking him to drink?

226
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:52,674
Will you just stay still?

227
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:55,975
The only way to see a man's true colors...

228
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:58,370
is to get him drunk.

229
00:13:58,844 --> 00:13:59,944
Do you have money to buy drinks?

230
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:02,139
So while we're on that subject,

231
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,409
can you lend me 10 dollars?

232
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:10,725
He looks unrealistic.

233
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,054
He's rich and good-looking.

234
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,750
Why does he like my sister, who has nothing?

235
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:15,590
Let's do that.

236
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,289
- What? - Let's have a drink.

237
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,844
My sister thinks I'm thoughtless...

238
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,409
and reckless.

239
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:33,740
You are.

240
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,509
Darn it. This is so frustrating.

241
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:42,220
I have plans too. I think too.

242
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:47,094
Sure. You have plans and you think too, right?

243
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,194
Right! You're right.

244
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:50,460
You're so right.

245
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:53,389
You don't know anything.

246
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:55,230
I'm going to start tomorrow.

247
00:14:57,204 --> 00:14:58,704
People always ask when you'll do it...

248
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,475
right before you're about to,

249
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:01,929
and kill your mood.

250
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,714
Are you a mind reader?

251
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:09,710
You are so good at reading people's minds.

252
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:15,480
No one understands how I feel.

253
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:17,025
No matter how lonely and hard it is,

254
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:18,990
I pretend to be strong and positive.

255
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:25,220
If you're lonely, act lonely.

256
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:27,194
If things are hard, act like things are hard.

257
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,299
Don't act strong all the time, okay?

258
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:34,630
Okay. You pass.

259
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:37,240
What? He passes?

260
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:40,409
Please be good to my sister.

261
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:42,344
Who are you to say that?

262
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:43,639
Let go.

263
00:15:43,814 --> 00:15:44,944
It's nice to meet you, brother-in-law.

264
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,049
Hey.

265
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:52,049
My gosh! Look at the time!

266
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,495
I should go now.

267
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,860
Out of nowhere? It's late. Just sleep over.

268
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:58,525
No, it's fine.

269
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,064
I'm not clueless, you know.

270
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:03,630
What are you talking about? Do you want a beating?

271
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:05,600
Have fun, brother-in-law.

272
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,275
- Hey. Are you really leaving? - Brother-in-law.

273
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:09,674
- Sun Kyung. - Yes.

274
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:10,975
- Hey. - Yes.

275
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:12,245
I'll say bye from here, brother-in-law.

276
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:13,409
Okay.

277
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:16,080
Darn it.

278
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:23,919
Cheers.

279
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:30,259
Of course, I know he's lonely and life is hard.

280
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,395
And what's wrong with you?

281
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:32,964
How could you listen to it just because you hear it?

282
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:34,929
That's so rude.

283
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:36,664
But I hear it. What can I do?

284
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:39,399
You should try not to hear.

285
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:41,929
I thought you were different, but where are your manners?

286
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,510
Hey!

287
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,280
What?

288
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,025
Can't I smoke in my own home?

289
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,594
Exactly. This is my home.

290
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,620
How is that your home?

291
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,919
What happened earlier may happen again.

292
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:38,989
I need to smoke.

293
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,729
And I didn't like how you liked my home.

294
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:48,199
Fine, if that's how you want to play.

295
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:51,040
This is nice. My place just got a whole lot bigger.

296
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:55,110
Why did he say let's live together then?

297
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:57,610
You're the one who said let's live together.

298
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:06,189
That's him, right?

299
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,520
The person you love the most.

300
00:18:16,604 --> 00:18:17,800
No, it isn't.

301
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,370
I said it isn't.

302
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,899
Don't even think about hurting him.

303
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,544
You're the one...

304
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:28,169
who should think about what happens to him, not I.

305
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:36,550
Fine. If that's how you want to play.

306
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:55,270
Why are you putting a blanket there?

307
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,270
In case you do something to my home while I'm asleep.

308
00:18:58,544 --> 00:18:59,870
I will if you want.

309
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,709
I'm a light sleeper.

310
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:05,239
Are we bragging now?

311
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:08,110
I can kill people.

312
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:10,425
Forget it. Go to sleep.

313
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:11,685
I told you before.

314
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,489
I don't eat or sleep since I'm not human.

315
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:18,360
- You ate the cake. - I was playing along.

316
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,530
I see, is that right?

317
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:23,199
Then play along, and turn off the lights.

318
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,969
I'm reading.

319
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:51,889
Do you think the world has to end?

320
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:54,229
Not really.

321
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:58,060
Then why are you doing this?

322
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:00,969
Because it doesn't have to exist either.

323
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:05,639
Beings like you usually pity humans.

324
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:08,239
Especially humans like me.

325
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:10,880
Are you close to someone like me?

326
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,580
That's how they are in the fantasy movies I've watched.

327
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:17,380
Humans are all terminal.

328
00:20:17,854 --> 00:20:19,949
They live eternally only until they realize that.

329
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:23,120
They're all insignificant. They're all the same.

330
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:26,790
That's why there's no need to pity anyone in particular.

331
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:31,364
Pitying someone comes from the heart.

332
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,630
It's not a need.

333
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,499
I have no heart since I'm not human.

334
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:40,070
Liar.

335
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:45,209
You said you felt the same thing I did...

336
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,679
at the same time.

337
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:07,367
Here. Dong Kyung.

338
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,631
Mine is bigger.

339
00:22:08,897 --> 00:22:11,566
Let's go on the Ferris wheel.

340
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:12,871
- Yes! - Let's go.

341
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:17,542
Sun Kyung! Come have some watermelon!

342
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:23,212
- Happy birthday, Dong Kyung. - Happy birthday.

343
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:47,202
Did you sleep well?

344
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:51,972
You must've had a good dream.

345
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:57,111
Did you come into my dream?

346
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,581
Me?

347
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:01,052
No.

348
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:03,222
I'm only in your home.

349
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,621
What are you doing?

350
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,522
Instilling fear.

351
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:16,331
Get out.

352
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:32,911
All right. Let's settle our terms.

353
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,881
The terms are...

354
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:39,151
I have to ask you...

355
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:43,222
to destroy the world before I die.

356
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:46,431
During the period of our contract, my last 100 days,

357
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:48,765
I will not feel any pain.

358
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:50,401
You're like Cinderella.

359
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:52,462
You need to recharge before midnight.

360
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:58,276
Other than asking you...

361
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:01,316
to destroy the world before I die,

362
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,516
you have to grant me a real wish.

363
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:05,982
I'm regretting that now.

364
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:09,381
Without that condition, things would've been much easier.

365
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:14,492
If I violate the terms of the contract,

366
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:19,637
the person I love the most...

367
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:23,802
in the world will die at that very moment.

368
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:25,977
Why are you so negative?

369
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:27,532
You could still live.

370
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:28,671
Wait.

371
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:31,502
Then, either way, that person is going to die.

372
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:33,016
If I violate the contract, that person will die.

373
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:34,647
But even if I don't, that person will still die.

374
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:36,441
Who? Tak Sun Kyung?

375
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:40,012
Fine. Let's just kill him then. That works for me too.

376
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:47,822
When you wanted the world to end, you didn't even think about him.

377
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:50,627
Because I didn't mean that.

378
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:52,361
No, you did.

379
00:24:53,637 --> 00:24:56,062
I wouldn't have heard it unless you meant it.

380
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:16,121
See you later.

381
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,457
Have a good day.

382
00:25:18,457 --> 00:25:21,492
Your last 100 days are starting today.

383
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:14,917
(Ask the world to end before dying.)

384
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,217
(Free of any physical pain for the last 100 days.)

385
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:17,286
(Make another wish before dying.)

386
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,381
(The person I love the most will die if I violate the terms.)

387
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:22,856
(Wish, doom, and the person I love the most)

388
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:24,387
Seriously. Young Prince is amazing.

389
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:27,756
His post got thousands of views the moment it was uploaded.

390
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:29,391
Episode 94 will be good too, right?

391
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:31,591
Of course. Why would you even ask that?

392
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:38,607
Jijo King is dead set against making the revisions.

393
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,977
I guess even your good looks didn't work on him.

394
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:42,947
I guess I'm not that good-looking.

395
00:26:42,947 --> 00:26:44,907
Gosh. Don't say stuff like that.

396
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:46,171
You are very good-looking.

397
00:26:46,546 --> 00:26:48,841
My good looks aren't for you.

398
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,742
Did Siberia sign a new contract for the upcoming novel?

399
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:56,381
Siberia came a few days ago and met with Ms. Tak.

400
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:59,657
He's already posting two novels right now.

401
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:01,427
So handling three novels at the same time would be too much.

402
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:03,896
So we'll sign a new contract when one of the novels is over.

403
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:04,967
How's his speed?

404
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,566
You know that he's not slow.

405
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,336
I haven't heard from him for a while now.

406
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,066
But he already gave us a lot of episodes in advance,

407
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,636
so I'm keeping my eye on him for now.

408
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:12,871
Really?

409
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:14,877
I'll call him and see how he's doing.

410
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:17,177
Look at that. Mr. Good-looking feels confident that...

411
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,611
Siberia is going to answer his calls.

412
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,846
That's it for today.

413
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:22,812
- Good work. - Good work.

414
00:27:23,786 --> 00:27:25,316
(Hey, the boiler...)

415
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:27,482
Hey, the boiler at your house is running.

416
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:30,081
- What was that? - Darn him. What?

417
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,121
Didn't that get typed on its own?

418
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:33,822
What are you talking about?

419
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:36,427
My gosh. The meeting today was so long, wasn't it?

420
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:37,496
- No... - It was way too long.

421
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,661
I'm so tired. Aren't you tired? Gosh. I'm so tired.

422
00:27:42,566 --> 00:27:44,431
Please insert a card.

423
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:47,407
I won't ask a lot. Just wire me 300 dollars.

424
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:48,972
That depends on you.

425
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:51,641
Then, 200 dollars.

426
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:54,411
That might drive up the heating bill a lot.

427
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:56,887
Come on. Darn it.

428
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:59,312
- Then, just 50 dollars. - Gosh.

429
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:02,921
Hey!

430
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:09,056
Lunch is the reason I come to work.

431
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,621
I need to cure my hangover. I want jjamppong.

432
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:16,901
What should I eat today?

433
00:28:16,937 --> 00:28:18,667
I wanted to turn it off,

434
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,506
but the number keeps going up.

435
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:22,732
You know, I have no experience in this.

436
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:28,016
How many minutes do we have left for our lunch break?

437
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,212
What is it?

438
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:30,911
About 40 minutes?

439
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:32,746
Sorry. You guys should eat without me.

440
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:34,411
Hey, where are you going?

441
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,121
What?

442
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:44,022
Hey!

443
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:46,232
Darn it.

444
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:50,661
(Absent Mode)

445
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:52,766
I figured out the system when I tried out a few buttons.

446
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,302
You should thank me.

447
00:28:56,746 --> 00:28:59,042
Come on. This guy...

448
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:06,611
Yes, Ms. Cha.

449
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:08,457
I'm on my way right now.

450
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:10,552
Yes. Go to the funeral now.

451
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:11,722
Pardon?

452
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,222
I'm sorry. I had an urgent call.

453
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:22,792
This should be the most urgent matter on your hands.

454
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:25,566
My ranking got pushed down.

455
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:27,107
Right. I see.

456
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,677
What? Shanghai Park?

457
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:31,647
This writer I've never heard of is climbing up now.

458
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,742
This industry has a lot of competition.

459
00:29:35,117 --> 00:29:39,851
I heard that all the writers you handle are in the top 10.

460
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:41,812
What's your secret?

461
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:43,421
I'm not sure.

462
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,722
The writers work really hard.

463
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:49,822
Gosh. Don't be a stranger now.

464
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:55,361
I'll tell you if you pay me.

465
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,331
Gosh. You make such nasty jokes.

466
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,431
I wasn't joking.

467
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:03,707
Do you want to sign with me?

468
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:05,502
A personal contract with just me.

469
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:08,217
You will do exactly what I tell you to do.

470
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:10,581
If you get into the top 10 writers, I get a bonus.

471
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,081
Do you mean that?

472
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:21,022
That was a joke. No way.

473
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:22,952
The school reunion?

474
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:25,867
- Why all of a sudden? - It's not all of a sudden.

475
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,595
We've been having reunions for nine years without you.

476
00:30:27,596 --> 00:30:29,566
The girls really want to catch up with you.

477
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,536
Tell them I'm still in Japan.

478
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:32,806
Seriously?

479
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:34,901
What was your nickname? Swimming Prince?

480
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,607
That's all in the past now.

481
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:39,477
The girls called you the Swimming Prince.

482
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:41,516
They said that you always smelled like soap.

483
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:43,441
And they were crazy about you.

484
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:46,117
When Na Ji Na made a banner with that line,

485
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:48,081
it was hilarious.

486
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,326
Who's coming?

487
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:53,957
Da Young, Eun Bi, and Jung Hwa.

488
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:55,857
Hey, I heard that Na Ji Na is coming too.

489
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:58,222
- Really? - Na Ji Na is coming too?

490
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:03,736
Hey, I'm busy. Bye.

491
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,066
Will you come or not? Just tell me that.

492
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,306
Fine. I'll come.

493
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:09,431
- You have to come. - Okay.

494
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:11,972
What would you like?

495
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:13,911
What do you want?

496
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:19,116
It's a glioblastoma.

497
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:21,181
You have multifocal glioblastomas.

498
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:26,256
I will find out more with a biopsy.

499
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:27,457
I'll do it.

500
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:30,091
I'll do everything. Please help me.

501
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:33,796
With the surgery, you have 1 year. Without it, you have 3 months.

502
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:35,266
Even if you get the surgery, you may suffer from hemiplegia,

503
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:37,732
a speech disorder, and a cognitive disorder as well.

504
00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:42,401
I'll get the surgery. I'll get it now.

505
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:45,671
Please help me. Help me, doctor.

506
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:52,812
Right. This is the normal reaction.

507
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:56,181
Pardon?

508
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,792
I mean, you should be the one clinging on to me, right?

509
00:32:02,457 --> 00:32:04,322
She's so weird.

510
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:07,391
Pardon?

511
00:32:15,236 --> 00:32:16,502
What was that?

512
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:19,871
Why am I crying?

513
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:23,212
I'm not sure. Because you got lost?

514
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:25,641
Turn right for the otolaryngology department.

515
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:27,611
Thank you.

My grandfather was proud that I was a writer.

520
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:15,061
He always asked me what I was writing,

521
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,662
but I was always too embarrassed...

522
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:18,762
to tell him.

523
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:24,671
I'm sure he would've loved it.

524
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:29,441
I also love your work.

525
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,811
Really?

526
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:33,651
You enjoyed reading "You Were Never a Friend to Me"?

530
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,926
No, I enjoyed reading your other work called,

"I, the Leader of Demons, Am Just an Average..."

You see,

537
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,572
that's your problem.

538
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:02,771
The stuff you love isn't exactly the stuff you're good at.

539
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:11,122
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that here.

540
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,921
It's okay. It's about work anyway.

541
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,722
I didn't even show up to our last meeting.

The writer is wandering around somewhere.

543
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:20,892
I needed time with you.

544
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:26,536
By any chance, were you lost that day?

545
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:28,202
I was lost in my dreams. I thought I was gone for good.

546
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:30,742
I don't know why I slept for so long.

547
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:34,041
I woke up, and the entire day had already passed by.

548
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:35,572
You were asleep?

549
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:37,481
Gosh.

550
00:34:38,216 --> 00:34:39,647
Thank you for coming.

551
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,182
I know I already put you through enough.

552
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:42,917
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

553
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,122
No, don't say that. You didn't put me through anything.

554
00:34:45,187 --> 00:34:47,056
Don't worry about finishing your story for now.

555

We'll take care of it.

556
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:51,061
You should take enough time to grieve and feel better.

557
00:34:51,766 --> 00:34:52,892
Thank you.

558
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,231

This one.

565
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,846
You need to take this one.

566
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:12,041
But it's leaving.

567
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:15,171

Hey.

573
00:36:38,136 --> 00:36:39,932
How did you know I was here?

574
00:36:40,176 --> 00:36:41,802
I actually had something to ask.

575
00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:44,076
Let's go. Let's talk later.

576
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,406
- No, but... - Let's talk at home.

577
00:36:46,406 --> 00:36:47,972
What's with you?

578
00:36:50,587 --> 00:36:52,082
I've seen you before.

579
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:56,881
What?

580
00:36:57,286 --> 00:37:00,552
I've seen you before at a funeral hall.

581
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:13,771
You were crying that day.

582
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,322
I suddenly remembered.

583
00:37:39,797 --> 00:37:41,596
You told me you don't eat or sleep,

584
00:37:41,596 --> 00:37:42,797
have no feelings,

585
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,237
and never feel sorry for anyone.

586
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:46,532
But it was all a lie.

587
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:48,572
How are you going to explain all those tears?

588
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:51,841
What are you talking about? That wasn't me.

589
00:37:52,846 --> 00:37:54,171
I see.

590
00:37:55,477 --> 00:37:57,182
I guess adults cry too.

591
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:02,556
A bus will arrive shortly.

592
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:03,682

594
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:23,477
Yes, it was you.

595
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:24,746
No, it wasn't me.

596
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:26,072
Yes, it was.

597
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:37,556
Hey, you told me you don't sleep.

598
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:39,322
Why are you suddenly pretending to sleep?

599
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:41,552
Let's say you really do sleep.

600
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:44,622
But why do you sleep there when you have tons of other rooms?

601
00:38:45,196 --> 00:38:46,892
Because I'm worried about you.

602
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,091
Are you serious?

603
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:51,302
You're not worried I might do something to your place?

604
00:38:54,337 --> 00:38:56,377
Hey, you should quit work.

605
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:57,446
All of a sudden?

606
00:38:57,446 --> 00:38:59,102
Just quit and stay home.

607
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:01,477
I may be dying soon,

608
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,441
but I still need to earn money for food.

609
00:39:04,116 --> 00:39:06,341
I need to pay my rent, food,

610
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:08,952
and heating bill.

611
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:11,286
How will I afford to pay my living expenses?

612
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:12,786
Make a wish and ask for money.

613
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:14,191
Say a number and you'll get it.

614
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:16,426
I can't do that.

615
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:18,322
I don't want to waste my wish on that.

616
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:20,332
You need to put your guard up.

617
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,496
Don't show that bracelet to anyone.

618
00:39:22,496 --> 00:39:24,001
It could become your weakness.

619
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,131
What's with you today?

620
00:39:28,437 --> 00:39:29,572
You don't...

621
00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:31,972
have feelings for me, do you?

622
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:37,886
Okay, I guess you don't. But don't give me that look.

623
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:39,016
You're making me feel embarrassed.

624
00:39:39,016 --> 00:39:40,116
I'm not human,

625
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:41,912
so I don't exactly know what that feels like.

626
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:48,826
You're really weird.

627
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:51,561
- You know that? - If anything happens,

628
00:39:52,596 --> 00:39:54,091
don't say I didn't warn you.

629
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:01,202
My gosh, how scary.

630
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,242
I'm so scared that I might even cry.

631
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:05,901
I didn't cry.

632
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:09,016
If you're not human,

633
00:40:09,016 --> 00:40:11,286
why do you get worked up every time I ask if you cried?

634
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:12,912
Getting worked up is also a form of emotion.

635
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:18,056
It's almost time for midnight.

636
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:19,182
Give me your hand.

637
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:31,401
But do you really not remember me?

638
00:40:31,937 --> 00:40:33,731
I was right across the hall.

639
00:40:34,937 --> 00:40:38,372
I was just as pretty as I was back when I was young.

640
00:40:43,016 --> 00:40:44,282
I guess you're sleeping.

641
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:46,386
You told me you don't eat or sleep...

642
00:40:46,386 --> 00:40:47,687
and that you have no emotions,

643
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:48,912
but look at you sleeping right now.

644
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:05,802
I don't sleep.

645
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:08,731
Not once even when you're asleep.

646
00:41:11,076 --> 00:41:14,012
It means I'm always awake when you're defenseless.

647
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,142
That means I'm dangerous.

648
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:31,091
By the way,

649
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:33,662
why did you cry so much that day?

650
00:41:33,937 --> 00:41:35,332
Whom did you lose?

651
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:38,102
My mother.

652
00:41:39,507 --> 00:41:41,532
- Your mother? - Yes, I guess.

653
00:41:42,507 --> 00:41:43,671
She was something similar.

654
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:53,282
So you did cry.

655
00:41:54,216 --> 00:41:55,552
I said I didn't cry.

656
00:42:15,737 --> 00:42:17,271
Were you sad when I died?

657
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,171
Do you enjoy showing up unannounced these days?

658
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:23,246
You acted so cold,

659
00:42:23,246 --> 00:42:24,642
but I guess you even know how to cry.

660
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:26,682
Why did you approach her?

661
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:29,616
I said I'll do anything.

662
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:32,582
Forget it. She'll die soon anyway.

663
00:42:33,696 --> 00:42:35,251
That's what I should be saying.

664
00:42:35,457 --> 00:42:37,122
At least I won't be harming her.

665
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,392
I guess you guys are pretty close now.

666
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:43,591
Just close enough.

667
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:45,802
That's good.

668
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:48,802
It was your first time having a human remember you, right?

669
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,472
But then again,

670
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:53,477
I bet it was hard to forget...

671
00:42:53,477 --> 00:42:55,912
since you were crying your eyes out that day.

672
00:42:59,147 --> 00:43:00,487
Don't get the wrong idea.

673
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:02,052
I need to go now. Bye.

674
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:05,452
Don't cry because I'm gone.

675
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:08,992
Hey. Hey!

676
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:17,631
Darn it. Dong Kyung.

677
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:20,676
Your blood pressure and heart rate are good today.

678
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:22,872
Your condition improved a lot recently.

679
00:43:22,877 --> 00:43:25,872
At this rate, you can go home soon.

680
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:27,441
Really?

681
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:38,322
Liar.

682
00:43:53,977 --> 00:43:56,671
Your condition improved a lot too.

683
00:43:56,937 --> 00:44:00,242
At this rate, a flower will bloom soon.

684
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:08,017
What...

685
00:44:08,017 --> 00:44:09,348
is this?

686
00:44:09,348 --> 00:44:11,917
The new writer is kind of old.

687
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:15,782
He only writes on paper.

688
00:44:16,158 --> 00:44:18,853
- And? - You're in charge.

689
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:20,968
Says who?

690
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:22,322
Says the CEO.

691
00:44:22,598 --> 00:44:23,828
Is he back?

692
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,893
He is. Tragically.

693
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:29,932
I don't know if it's been too long since I've seen him,

694
00:44:30,238 --> 00:44:31,833
but he seems different.

695
00:44:42,187 --> 00:44:45,583
That's our CEO? That?

696
00:44:45,718 --> 00:44:48,423
I don't think he seems that different.

697
00:44:51,328 --> 00:44:53,853
He's driving me insane.

698
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:13,948
Are you insane?

699
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:15,512
No, I'm totally sane.

700
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,353
Is this because I teased you for crying?

701
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:19,888
- No way. - Oh my gosh, it is.

702
00:45:19,888 --> 00:45:22,227
You seem to like living with me,

703
00:45:22,227 --> 00:45:23,888
so I thought you'd like working with me too.

704
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,457
Why are you doing this at someone else's company?

705
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:27,293
A company isn't a playground.

706
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:30,293
Someone else's company? I'm the CEO.

707
00:45:31,298 --> 00:45:32,662
Why you...

708
00:45:32,798 --> 00:45:35,408
I ought to... Get over here. Get...

709
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:37,903
Sir. We have the date for the web novel conference.

710
00:45:43,278 --> 00:45:45,048
Were you in the middle of something important?

711
00:45:45,048 --> 00:45:46,173
Yes.

712
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:48,882
We were in the middle of a very important discussion.

713
00:45:50,718 --> 00:45:53,153
I see. I'll let you continue.

714
00:45:55,928 --> 00:45:58,198
Ms. Tak. Isn't it time for your meeting with Lee Hyun?

715
00:45:58,198 --> 00:45:59,992
You go for me.

716
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:01,693
What?

717
00:46:02,798 --> 00:46:04,463
As you can see,

718
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:08,432
I'm very busy right now, so you go in my place.

719
00:46:10,738 --> 00:46:12,432
Okay, sure.

720
00:46:19,618 --> 00:46:20,943
She's acting weird.

721
00:46:21,817 --> 00:46:23,112
She has changed.

722
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:28,388
Do you like him?

723
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:30,253
What? Why?

724
00:46:30,698 --> 00:46:33,092
Does that punk like me?

725
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:35,193
No.

726
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,193
I meant, give up if you do.

727
00:46:37,368 --> 00:46:39,036
He was cursing you inside.

728
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:40,098
At least I say it out loud.

729
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:42,503
Why you... Seriously...

730
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,678
Are you coming to the reunion? Hyun Kyu's coming.

731
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:54,313
(Are you coming to the reunion? Hyun Kyu's coming.)

But he failed and came back and opened a cafe in Korea.

Ms. Tak was busy with work.

747
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:03,143
I had something to give you regarding ending the series.

748
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:04,917
And I had feedback for you on the new series.

749
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:07,653
Should we discuss the new series first?

750
00:48:09,758 --> 00:48:11,923
- Sure. - I don't know...

751
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:15,928
how to even begin.

752
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:18,162
It's fine. Just speak comfortably.

753
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:21,563
I will. It's our job to say it even if it's uncomfortable.

754
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:26,403
I see.

755
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:28,948
Do you think a man who avoids problems...

756
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,943
whenever something happens is attractive?

757
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:33,448
- What? - This is the pattern...

758
00:48:33,448 --> 00:48:35,382
for all of your male main characters.

759
00:48:35,618 --> 00:48:38,058
When the woman says she likes him, he runs away and rejects her.

760
00:48:38,058 --> 00:48:39,658
If something happens, he takes off by himself.

761
00:48:39,658 --> 00:48:41,558
There needs to be a conflict for them to get together.

762
00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:44,058
I'm asking if that conflict is attractive.

763
00:48:44,058 --> 00:48:46,298
I must write it because I think so.

764
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,992
- Ms. Lee. - What?

765
00:48:52,837 --> 00:48:55,463
So, your real name is...

766
00:48:56,508 --> 00:48:59,107
Na Ji Na?

767
00:48:59,107 --> 00:49:00,537
Yes, It's Na Ji Na.

768
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,302
Is "Lee Hyun" from his name?

769
00:49:02,508 --> 00:49:03,802
Lee Hyun Kyu.

770
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:08,412
I guess I'm right.

771
00:49:11,457 --> 00:49:13,313
That's why they're all like that.

772
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:15,753
Because they're based on him.

773
00:49:29,308 --> 00:49:30,632
Is this okay?

774
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:33,278
People will get the wrong idea if you're in here for too long.

It'll all be over once you die anyway.

780
00:49:42,948 --> 00:49:45,182
Why are you working so hard?

781
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:50,722
My boss told me to do it, so naturally, I have to work hard.

782
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:53,722
Let's share the pain since we share a common fate.

783
00:49:54,098 --> 00:49:56,722
Who says we share a common fate?

784
00:49:56,727 --> 00:50:00,262
If we felt the same thing at the same time, well...

785
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:04,572
Hey. Forget it.

786
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:09,908
Can't you just beg nicely?

787
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:12,218
"Let's cancel the whole thing." How easy is that?

788
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,512
Why don't you know how to beg?

789
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:16,587
Will you do this then?

790
00:50:16,587 --> 00:50:17,658
I can't type.

791
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:20,618
I don't eat, sleep, cry, or type...

792
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:23,853
Then how did you type into my laptop?

793
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:25,928
Strictly put, I didn't type into it.

794
00:50:25,928 --> 00:50:27,397
I just showed it to you.

795
00:50:27,397 --> 00:50:29,468
Seriously, the mouth on this one.

796
00:50:29,468 --> 00:50:32,037
Does that mean you can't eat, sleep, or talk?

797
00:50:32,037 --> 00:50:33,597
Since you can cry?

798
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:36,937
Memories are very easily distorted.

799
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:39,738
Exactly. How did I forget that?

800
00:50:39,738 --> 00:50:41,903
You don't have a common face.

801
00:50:42,678 --> 00:50:44,003
That's true.

802
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:48,017
It's very common.

803
00:50:48,017 --> 00:50:50,342
This face is much more common than you'd think.

804
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:51,713
It's amazing.

805
00:50:51,857 --> 00:50:54,058
I couldn't remember at all,

806
00:50:54,058 --> 00:50:57,693
but when someone bumped into me, all of it came rushing back.

807
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:01,828
What?

808
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:05,432
I was standing there in the funeral parlor.

809
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,603
And someone bumped into me.

810
00:51:09,008 --> 00:51:10,937
Sorry...

811
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:12,173
Wait.

812
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:14,443
It was her.

813
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:18,373
The girl from the bus stop.

814
00:51:20,948 --> 00:51:22,687
Then I must do whatever it takes.

815
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:25,282
I said I'll do anything.

816
00:51:33,098 --> 00:51:34,693
Hey. Where are you going?

817
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:36,423
Hey. Hey!

818
00:51:56,817 --> 00:51:59,153
Is this the "anything" you said you'd do?

819
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,882
- You're here. - Is this what you meant?

820
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:05,393
What did I do?

821
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:08,563
All I did was make her remember things that happened.

822
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,762
You're the one who got close to her.

823
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:16,008
Did you realize what it means to have compassion?

824
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,273
- I don't know what that is. - No, you do.

825
00:52:18,937 --> 00:52:20,273
You just tell yourself that.

826
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:24,103
You smile a lot and feel bad for her, don't you?

827
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:27,213
- Your feelings will grow. - Never.

828
00:52:27,317 --> 00:52:28,988
Do you think you can let her die?

829
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:31,012
She was fated to die, to begin with.

830
00:52:32,787 --> 00:52:36,282
Can't you change her fate?

831
00:52:38,928 --> 00:52:40,552
How can I worry about her?

832
00:52:40,698 --> 00:52:41,968
How can I feel bad for her?

833
00:52:41,968 --> 00:52:45,162
You pity yourself the most in the world, don't you?

834
00:52:46,098 --> 00:52:47,563
What about you?

835
00:52:48,437 --> 00:52:49,762
Do you know what compassion is?

836
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:53,503
I pity the person who will die...

837
00:52:53,877 --> 00:52:56,242
in place of her in case you break the contract.

838
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:32,218
Seriously. I'll die before my time because of you.

839
00:53:32,218 --> 00:53:34,512
How could you just ditch me after making that huge mess?

840
00:53:34,948 --> 00:53:37,543
Wait. Why can't I find my key?

841
00:53:37,988 --> 00:53:39,612
I should change it to a smart door lock.

842
00:53:41,227 --> 00:53:43,952
I had to stay and work late today because of you.

843
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:51,733
Why do you keep staring at me?

844
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:54,162
You said...

845
00:53:55,008 --> 00:53:56,632
you remembered me, right?

846
00:53:57,808 --> 00:53:59,603
What? Yes.

847
00:53:59,977 --> 00:54:01,873
I remember you too.

848
00:54:21,897 --> 00:54:24,632
Everyone was crying, but a young girl was smiling.

849
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:29,103
It was sad to watch you, so I remember you.

850
00:54:34,678 --> 00:54:36,008
It was sad?

851
00:54:36,008 --> 00:54:38,512
I don't know where and when this all started.

852
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:40,917
Hey, what are you talking about?

853
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:42,443
But I don't care.

854
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:46,682
I don't plan on making you smile.

855
00:54:50,928 --> 00:54:52,523
Hey, why are you saying stuff like that?

856
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:55,722
Is it because I teased you for crying?

857
00:54:56,267 --> 00:54:58,762
Hey, I'm sorry if I offended you.

858
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,193
It will be midnight soon.

859
00:55:00,937 --> 00:55:03,762
But I will not hold your hand.

860
00:55:07,078 --> 00:55:09,643
What are you saying?

861
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,682
I've been too nice for no reason.

862
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:36,563
I need...

863
00:55:37,037 --> 00:55:38,233
Give me your hand.

864
00:55:38,638 --> 00:55:39,808
Is that your wish?

865
00:55:39,808 --> 00:55:42,178
I need your hand. Give me your hand!

866
00:55:42,178 --> 00:55:43,643
I'm asking you if that's your wish.

867
00:55:57,428 --> 00:55:58,592
Please...

868
00:55:59,098 --> 00:56:00,322
Is it?

869
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:40,492
I told you that you shouldn't lower your guard.

870
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:43,063
That bracelet could make you vulnerable.

871
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:47,373
I'm not human.

872
00:56:47,808 --> 00:56:49,802
I don't eat, sleep, or cry.

873
00:56:50,048 --> 00:56:51,317
I don't feel compassion or love.

874
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:53,112
Such feelings don't exist for me.

875
00:56:53,517 --> 00:56:56,682
That's what I decided a long time ago.

876
00:57:01,258 --> 00:57:03,623
I pity you.

877
00:57:04,897 --> 00:57:06,353
No, you should pity yourself.

878
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,992
You will cry because of me.

879
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:11,932
And you will want to destroy the world...

880
00:57:12,598 --> 00:57:14,492
because that's the only way to kill me.

881
00:57:26,548 --> 00:57:27,773
Is that...

882
00:57:28,718 --> 00:57:30,012
your grand plan?

883
00:57:42,227 --> 00:57:43,822
Then, this is my plan.

884
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:11,222
- Have you gone mad? - I knew it.

885
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:14,822
I knew you would stop me.

886
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:17,293
I figured you out.

887
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,632
You don't eat, sleep, or cry?

888
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:22,432
You don't feel compassion or love?

889
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:24,302
Because you're not human?

890
00:58:25,738 --> 00:58:28,643
But I do because I'm human.

891
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:31,103
So my plan is...

892
00:58:37,687 --> 00:58:39,282
to love you.

893
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:44,328
(Doom)

894
00:58:44,328 --> 00:58:46,428
(Doom, person I love the most)

895
00:58:46,428 --> 00:58:48,563
Then, I'll be able to live...

896
00:58:50,468 --> 00:58:52,132
without losing anything.

897
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:18,992
Then, let's do it right,

898
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:25,662
Love me to the point that you want to destroy the world for me.

899
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:02,532
(Doom at Your Service)

900
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:04,908
Everyone either resents me or wants me.

901
01:00:04,908 --> 01:00:06,107
No one loves me.

902
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:08,643
I will love you because I have to.

903
01:00:08,977 --> 01:00:10,008
Don't regret it.

904
01:00:10,008 --> 01:00:11,178
I don't remember.

905
01:00:11,178 --> 01:00:12,417
Why would she like someone like him?

906
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:13,917
Why can't she get over him?

907
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:16,583
You're signing it with me. A personal contract.

908
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,853
It's game over if he shows up in your dream.

909
01:00:20,457 --> 01:00:22,488
What would happen if I were to kill him now?

910
01:00:22,488 --> 01:00:24,123
Die!

911
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:26,428
I'm here for Tak Sun Kyung.

912
01:00:26,428 --> 01:00:29,322
If I can't kill you, I'll make you miserable.

913
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:32,592
I told you. You won't be able to love me.
