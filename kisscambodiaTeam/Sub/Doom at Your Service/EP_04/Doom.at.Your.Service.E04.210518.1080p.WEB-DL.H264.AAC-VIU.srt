1
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:26,338
My plan is to love you.

2
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:31,378
Then, I'll be able to live...

3
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:34,079
without losing anything.

4
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:43,859
Then, let's do it right,

5
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:48,429
Love me to the point that you want to destroy the world for me.

6
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:59,039
What do you say? Should I kiss you now?

7
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:11,219
What happened to the girl who was willing to risk her life?

8
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:15,559
I won't forget.

9
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:23,598
I won't forget what happened today.

10
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:26,768
I will remember it...

11
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:29,969
and do exactly what you did to me.

12
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:31,368
Which one?

13
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,609
How I tried to kill you or save you?

14
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:34,978
Both.

15
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:38,708
Here's my key.

16
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:48,958
Come on in.

17
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,728
Or you can run away.

18
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:06,978
Is that your wish?

19
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,138
I'm asking you if that's your wish.

20
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:18,089
(Episode 4)

21
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,479
My plan is to love you.

22
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,479
What are you doing?

23
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:00,678
I asked you a question.

24
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,778
- It's a blanket. - Why are you putting it there?

25
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:05,979
Let's go to sleep together.

26
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:11,018
You said you don't sleep, right?

27
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,433
Then let's just lie next to each other.

28
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,689
Bring a pillow.

29
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,534
You're really acting up.

30
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:21,874
What's wrong? Are you scared...

31
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,344
that I might do something to you?

32
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:25,044
You should be the one that's scared...

33
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:26,939
that I might do something to you.

34
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:28,669
I'm not scared.

35
00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:31,409
You can't love me.

36
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,609
No human has ever loved me before.

37
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:34,854
I can.

38
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:37,053
Everyone either resents me or just wants me.

39
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:38,379
But no one can love me.

40
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:43,659
I will because I must.

41
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:00,808
Then follow me.

42
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,669
You came in here willingly.

43
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:34,669
Don't regret it.

44
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:45,378
So what if I regret it?

45
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,318
I'll die anyway.

46
00:06:10,643 --> 00:06:11,738
Hey.

47
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,079
Are you sleeping?

48
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:18,919
No, I'm not.

49
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:21,519
What are you thinking?

50
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,888
I'm thinking that you're arrogant.

51
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:27,058
That you're insignificant.

52
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,229
That you're brave enough to act up when you're about to die.

53
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:32,099
That's what I'm thinking.

54
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:39,368
What about you?

55
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:42,508
That I must've been crazy...

56
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:47,649
and that I really could've died earlier.

57
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,448
That's what I'm thinking.

58
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:57,758
I'm also thinking...

59
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:01,529
that the way you looked at me earlier...

60
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:03,959
was so cold and scary.

61
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,368
And I also find it funny that I like...

62
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:16,979
how warm this feels right now.

63
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:24,008
Did you realize what it means to have compassion?

64
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,109
You smile a lot and feel bad for her, don't you?

65
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:29,149
Your feelings will grow.

66
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:59,308
Why is she such a know-it-all?

67
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,808
I hope she fails her test.

68
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:04,748
This is so darn annoying.

69
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:07,789
I don't want to go to work.

70
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,289
A group project?

71
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:13,359
Whatever. They can do it without me.

72
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:21,099
Is he nuts or what?

73
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:22,729
What's he looking at?

74
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,138
Compassion, my foot.

75
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:38,754
(The world is coming to an end.)

76
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,954
We must get ready for that day.

77
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:43,089
Doom is on its way.

78
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,229
Do you mean it?

79
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,788
What?

80
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:51,364
Do you really want the world to come to an end?

81
00:09:51,364 --> 00:09:55,229
The world doesn't end simply because we wish for it.

82
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:58,244
It's all because of our sins...

83
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,642
The world should come to an end.

84
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:03,143
That way, I, the chosen one,

85
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:07,579
will get to be reborn again and live a happy life.

86
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:12,148
Who says you're the chosen one?

87
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:18,059
You know what? If that were true, things would've been a lot easier.

88
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:20,193
It's your fault.

89
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:22,192
You should've been more desperate.

90
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:24,563
What are you talking about?

91
00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:26,158
Do you want to know a secret?

92
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,498
There is no next life.

93
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:32,638
This one is all you get.

94
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:33,969
That's not true.

95
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:37,043
The deity has given us a chance...

96
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,584
to live another life.

97
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:40,484
What do you think will happen to the manager...

98
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:42,479
if the people he or she manages all disappear?

99
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:44,349
Wouldn't he or she disappear too?

100
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:50,319
That's what I'm betting on.

Let's share stories about how you suddenly fell in love.

120
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:04,724
Back when I was in high school,

121
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:06,494
I was on a bench during PE class because I was sick.

122
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,094
And suddenly, a ball flew toward me.

123
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:10,134
But this guy in class, who's usually really quiet,

124
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:11,433
got up and blocked the ball for me.

125
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,803
Then he asked me if I was okay.

126
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:15,834
And that suddenly made me fall for him.

127
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,403
- You're making my heart flutter. - Amazing.

128
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:18,704
Imagine a school senior...

129
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:21,214
sitting by the window in a library wearing a clean shirt.

130
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:22,943
That already says it all. He's my boyfriend now.

131
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:23,943
Tell us more.

132
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,114
Here's a classic. Seeing a guy reverse. Game over.

133
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,349
- And a parking ticket in his mouth. - I agree with the parking ticket.

134
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:34,349
These girls fall in love so easily.

137
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,238
Ms. Lee, where are you right now?

138
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:58,209
You want to love someone?

139
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:04,079
- Name. - "Name"?

140
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:06,479
What's the guy's name? Tell me.

141
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:07,823
Why do you want to know his name?

142
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:09,494
What do you think?

143
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,018
I want to find out everything about his life.

144
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:12,618
His name...

145
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:15,758
Come to think of it, I never asked.

146
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:17,199
What?

147
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:19,559
You fell in love with him when you don't even know his name?

148
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:22,433
I didn't fall in love with him. I want to love him.

149
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:23,738
That's the same thing.

150
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,398
Where did you meet?

151
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,813
Where did we meet?

152
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:29,339
- At a hospital? - Hospital?

153
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,339
- Is he a doctor? - I don't think so.

154
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:33,648
Is he a patient?

155
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:37,783
Was the funeral parlor the first place we met?

156
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:38,979
Funeral parlor?

157
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:42,189
He is alive... Right?

158
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:44,994

the 101 ways to fall in love.

160
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,959
If you plan it, it isn't love.

161
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:53,359
It's not that easy.

162

It happened in an instant.

166
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:04,783
- Oh my gosh. - Later.

167
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,913
- See you later. - He's so cute.

168
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:08,508
Oh my gosh.

169
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:11,378
He's so cute.

170
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:21,788
I smell soap.

171
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:54,229
Seriously, Ji Na.

172
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,329
You're such an easy-to-get girl.

173
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:58,028
Hey.

174
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:00,303
It's crazy hard to meet someone...

175
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:02,469
with that face, that body, that smile, in a moment like that.

176
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:03,868
It's not easy.

177
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,143
It was strange.

178
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,339
Everyone else smelled like sweat, but he smelled like soap.

179
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,339
Maybe only he washed up.

180
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,949
So, it happens in an instant.

181
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:17,754
Do I have to wait for that instant?

182
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:18,984
Can't I create it?

183
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:20,449
I really don't have time.

184
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,764
- Then ask him out. - Out of nowhere?

185
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:26,063
Emotions blow up out of control...

186
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:27,988
once you admit it out loud.

187
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:29,933
Is that how you are?

188
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,329
That's right, I was.

189
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,569
I crossed the bridge of no return.

190
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,439
You played a big part.

191
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:40,709
What? Why are you dragging me into it?

192
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:43,309
Do you remember the first time we met?

193
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,638
When you came to Jeju Island on a class trip?

194
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:50,378
Na Ji Na. Na Ji Na.

195
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:53,183
Na Ji Na. Na Ji Na.

196
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:54,949
You can count on me, kids.

197
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:59,158
Our first meeting was a humdinger.

198
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:01,464
You were the first girl to climb over a wall...

199
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:03,028
to meet me.

200
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:17,238
Oh my gosh.

201
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,408
You don't look like you go to our school.

202
00:17:22,884 --> 00:17:24,179
Do you live here?

203
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:26,219
Good.

204
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,288
Do you know where the closest grocery store is?

205
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:32,059
30 minutes.

206
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:34,028
- Thanks. - By car.

207
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:37,628
Darn it.

208
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,599
Is there a liquor store nearby?

209
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:04,819
Awesome.

210
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,728
How much?

211
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,259
A dollar?

212
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:15,999
You thief.

213
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:20,569
Fine.

214
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,478
Hey! Hyun Kyu!

215
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:26,579
I need to talk to you.

216
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:29,549
Hyun Kyu!

217
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:32,579
Lee Hyun Kyu! Get out here!

218
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:34,519
Hyun Kyu.

219
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,418
- What's going on? - Hyun Kyu.

220
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:39,664
Hyun Kyu! I know you're in here.

221
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:41,264
- She's so annoying. - What's wrong with her?

222
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:43,329
- I need to talk to you. - She must be drunk.

223
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,898
It's Hyun Kyu.

224
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:01,878
Hey.

225
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:05,249
I like you.

226
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:08,349
- Oh my gosh. - Go out with me!

227
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:10,989
Go out with her!

228
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:15,029
- Go out with her! - Go out with her!

229
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:16,829
You're the aggressive female protagonist.

230
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:19,859
We need the runaway male protagonist, and it's your novel.

231
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:23,368
Do you think that too?

232
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:25,898
Why? Did Mr. Cha tell you that?

233
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,009
No. Just because...

234
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:31,684
How could you forget a first love...

235
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:33,014
that amazing?

236
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:35,309
It's only natural that it left a mark in your life.

237
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:37,654
Forget it.

238
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:39,279
That jerk Mr. Cha knows nothing.

239
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,188
You're right. He knows nothing.

240
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:45,218
He used to show up in my dreams all the time.

241
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:47,559
Yes. Dreams.

242
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,289
Have a dream.

243
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:52,434
- A dream? - Think about him like mad...

244
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:53,873
just before you go to sleep.

245
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,674
Do you have a picture? Check his social media page...

246
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,004
and look at his picture before you go to sleep.

247
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:58,773
Once he appears in your dream, it's game over.

248
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:00,509
- Really? - That's right.

249
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,648
Okay. You just saved a life.

250
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,079
Your life?

251
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,549
Do you plan to love him with your whole life?

252
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:16,894
Who is this guy...

253
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:19,023
that has you burning with desire?

254
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:20,218
Give me three months.

255
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:23,059
I'll tell you everything after three months.

256
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:25,333
Three months?

257
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,769
Yes. Wait just three months.

258
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:31,599
I'll tell you myself after three months.

259
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:32,968
And I'll be totally fine.

260
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,769
You'll be fine?

261
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:38,309
You should plan to love until you're a wreck.

262
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:44,083
No matter how big a wreck I become because of my love,

263
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,718
I would never be as reckless as you.

264
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:47,589
What's the point?

265
00:20:47,853 --> 00:20:49,718
I never even kissed him.

266
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,359
They say first loves always end with a little regret.

267
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:56,888
Anyway...

268
00:20:58,603 --> 00:21:00,898
I recently met the guy I had my first kiss with.

269
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,533
What? Oh my gosh.

270
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,174
The guy whose name you don't know?

271
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:06,069
When? Where? How? Why?

272
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:08,769
Well...

273
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:10,908
Don't be too shocked.

274
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:12,339
What is it?

275
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,079
Cha Joo Ik.

276
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:18,279
His name is Cha Joo Ik. Mr. Cha.

277
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:21,718
- Your supervisor. - What?

278
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:27,658
That Cha... That Cha Joo Ik?

279
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:18,408
What? What is it?

280
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:21,984
- No. - No?

281
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:24,118
That doesn't answer either question.

282
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:26,783
- Say what you want to say. - What?

283
00:22:26,783 --> 00:22:29,089
You've been staring at me since you got back.

284
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:30,789
I was not.

285
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:33,559
I really wasn't.

286
00:22:35,293 --> 00:22:36,489
Fine, then.

287
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,928
- Mr. Cha. - What?

288
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:44,438
Never mind.

289
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,744
You know...

290
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:54,249
No, I don't.

291
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:03,648
What?

292
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,264
Have you ever fallen in love with someone you hated?

293
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,859
No. I've kissed someone I hated though.

294
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:17,638
Why?

295
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:19,839
I hated her because I pitied her,

296
00:23:20,004 --> 00:23:22,339
but I ended up kissing her because I pitied her.

297
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:29,408
- Does that answer it? - What? Answer what?

298
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:31,049
Anything.

299
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,249
Yes, it did.

300
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:38,859
That's good.

301
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:42,764
Still, how could you kiss her?

302
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,599
I can hear you. Speak quietly.

303
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,734
Still, how could you kiss her?

304
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,099
Quieter.

305
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:52,204
Still, how could you kiss her?

306
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:53,698
- Stop saying that. - Yes, sir.

307
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,009
- Go home. - Yes, sir.

308
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:01,849
I'll go home... Then...

309
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:05,148
Okay.

310
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:09,514
What's for dinner?

311
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:12,378
Why are you asking me? You're cooking tonight.

312
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:15,819
Gosh, I almost had him. That was pretty smooth.

313
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:19,019
("The Romantic Egoist")

314
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:23,888
Have you been driving my car?

315
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,228
What?

316
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,099
No.

317
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,638
I'll kill you.

318
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:38,509
Joo Ik, since we're on the subject, let me ask you for a favor.

319
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:41,509
I have a school reunion next week. Let me borrow your car.

320
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:43,708
- Get lost. - Come on.

321
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:47,853
I haven't seen my school friends for ages.

322
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:51,164
Please. Come on, Joo Ik.

323
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:53,363
Why do you need my car for a school reunion?

324
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:55,658
I told you to tone down your pretentious side.

325
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:58,499
It's not like I want to be pretentious.

326
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,974
If I didn't eat the rice cake you gave me the day before the CSAT,

327
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:06,539
my life wouldn't be this hard.

328
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:09,944
Gosh. Forget I asked. I can't go to the reunion...

329
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:11,908
because I'm too embarrassed to face them.

330
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:16,648
- Fine. - Thank you. I love you.

331
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:22,053
The kindness of a teacher is as high as the sky

332
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:24,264
How did I let someone like him get into my life?

333
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:27,829
Think of it as paying back for the tutoring fees my dad paid you.

334
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,563
I worked for those tutoring fees.

335
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:31,264
Teaching a stupid-head like you was...

336
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:34,099
For what? I couldn't go to college because of you.

337
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:40,668
Why are you going to the reunion? Is your first love coming too?

338
00:26:41,514 --> 00:26:43,468
Do you even remember how she looked?

339
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:48,349
I don't.

340
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:51,349
How can I remember her? It's ancient history.

341
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:56,918
Joo Ik.

342
00:26:57,764 --> 00:27:00,158
The girl who asked for my number at the cafe texted me.

343
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,734
Usually, I separate work from my personal life.

344
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:07,464
But she was totally my type to just let her slip away.

345
00:27:07,464 --> 00:27:09,968
Look. Isn't she gorgeous?

346
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:18,378
Isn't she pretty?

347
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,249
I'm getting a call.

348
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,049
Hello?

349
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:27,749
Yes. Oh, the school reunion?

350
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:30,654
Yes. Of course, I should be there.

351
00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:31,859
Where are we meeting?

352
00:27:32,593 --> 00:27:33,718
What?

353
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:40,529
(Every woman I liked was Francoise.)

354
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:42,474
(They were a copy of you.)

355
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:46,069
(From "The Romantic Egoist")

356
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,509
Of course, you remember her.

357
00:27:49,744 --> 00:27:52,843
The train is approaching City Hall Station.

358
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:55,083
The doors are on your left.

359
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,978
The doors are opening.

360
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,323
- Excuse me. - I'm getting off.

361
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:00,618
- Let me pass through. - Excuse me.

362
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:02,849
Oh, no.

363
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:12,628
What is this?

364
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:14,099
Me?

365
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:16,128
Someone to hold onto.

366
00:28:37,823 --> 00:28:39,418
If you're tired, do you want to hold hands?

367
00:28:40,194 --> 00:28:41,489
Why are you doing this to me?

368
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:44,089
What?

369
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,658
Why are you acting nice all of a sudden?

370
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:49,069
Me?

371
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:52,569
Seriously. You always do whatever you want.

372
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:56,868
You disappear and show up as you please.

373
00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:59,043
Are you curious about where I went today?

374
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,339
I'm not curious.

375
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:04,484
I went out today and listened to what people were thinking.

376
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:06,654
Hey, I told you reading people's minds is bad manners.

377
00:29:06,654 --> 00:29:07,948
They are the same.

378
00:29:10,494 --> 00:29:11,994
They still think they are the most important people...

379
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:13,618
who deserve everyone's affection.

380
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:18,428
I knew it, but confirming that again was a nail in the coffin.

381
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:20,704
What do you mean?

382
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:23,898
I was right. People don't deserve my compassion.

383
00:29:24,444 --> 00:29:25,638
So...

384
00:29:26,004 --> 00:29:27,739
Go on.

385
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:33,908
I won't back down from your fight.

386
00:29:35,053 --> 00:29:38,378
I want to see you head over heels and give up everything for me.

387
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:08,853
- What are you doing? - I'm trying.

388
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:09,954
What are you trying?

389
00:30:09,954 --> 00:30:13,118
To figure out what I must do to fall in love with a special being.

390
00:30:13,484 --> 00:30:15,019
And did you find a solution?

391
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:16,718
- Yes. - What is it?

392
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:18,158
The looks.

393
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:21,059
Good looks are a must.

394
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:30,533
What is that supposed to mean?

395
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:33,099
Nothing good, I guess.

396
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:35,514
I guess you must've forgotten the first thing you said to me.

397
00:30:35,514 --> 00:30:36,573
Yes, I did.

398
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,109
But I didn't.

399
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,079
I don't want to hear it.

400
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:44,849
You need to spend the night with me again tonight.

401
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,718
As you wish.

402
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:49,049
Should I go over? Or will you come over?

403
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:51,148
You should come over...

404
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:52,958
to my dream.

405
00:30:56,959 --> 00:31:01,959
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E04 'Doom at Your Service'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

406
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:08,244
I heard that if I see you in my dream, it'd be game over.

407
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:09,609
That's what my friend told me.

408
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:12,739
I can tell this is a dream.

409
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:17,309
You must love this place.

410
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:18,849
You took me here.

411
00:31:19,484 --> 00:31:21,118
Your subconscious picked this place.

412
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:23,218
Really?

413
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:25,319
I guess I'm having a really tough time.

414
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,894
All right. Let's go to the second round.

415
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:30,063
- Second round? - Yes.

416
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:32,728
- To where? - On top of my head...

417
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,458
To a school.

418
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:39,039
(Dongseon High School)

419
00:31:40,244 --> 00:31:43,113
How should I put it? At school, there are mystery students...

420
00:31:43,113 --> 00:31:44,783
who would get sick often.

421
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:46,408
You know, the ones with fair skin.

422
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:48,378
That's my role.

423
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:53,218
Oh, no. Watch out!

424
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:04,728
Are you okay?

425
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,468
Next.

426
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:16,569
What is it this time?

427
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:18,408
It's continuing from the previous story.

428
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:20,744
That high school student graduated from school...

429
00:32:20,744 --> 00:32:23,853
and got into the college her crush goes to.

430
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:26,019
By the way, they met at a church.

431
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:29,049
Her crush plays the piano for the choir at the church.

432
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:32,218
I see. A nice guy from a church?

433
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:34,958
Hey.

434
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:38,198
You should drink this.

435
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:49,009
Thanks.

436
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:54,779
Next.

437
00:32:57,813 --> 00:32:58,948
What is it this time?

438
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:00,448
Drive in reverse.

439
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,089
Okay.

440
00:33:09,093 --> 00:33:10,228
Stop.

441
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:14,928
You forgot this. Open it.

442
00:33:24,514 --> 00:33:26,408
Gosh. I can't do this anymore.

443
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:29,908
Yes. Same here.

444
00:33:30,454 --> 00:33:31,718
This won't work.

445
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:35,549
Is this it for tonight?

446
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,728
Tell me about you.

447
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:49,128
To love someone, I must know his world.

448
00:33:49,204 --> 00:33:51,299
Show me your world.

449
00:33:53,004 --> 00:33:54,073
My world?

450
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,613
Just like my subconscious picked this world,

451
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,839
there must be a place for your subconscious too.

452
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:06,049
Let me tell you again. I'm not human.

453
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:08,749
My world is nowhere near what you expect.

454
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:15,029
But if that's what you want,

455
00:34:16,894 --> 00:34:18,158
then so be it.

456
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:51,799
This is my world.

457
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:41,339
The reason behind everything that disappears.

458
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:44,949
The deity that makes everything vanish.

459
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,894
It sure must be lonely to love the things...

460
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:51,589
that disappear...

461
00:35:52,494 --> 00:35:54,058
the moment you touch them.

462
00:35:54,894 --> 00:35:57,688
Lonely enough not to ever want to love them.

463
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,078
I think I finally understand...

464
00:36:21,994 --> 00:36:23,719
what it is...

465
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:26,219
that you're running away from.

466
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:33,332
- Shouldn't you go to work? - It's the weekend.

467
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:35,972
Fine.

468
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:45,812
- About last night's dream... - I'm going to forgive you.

469
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,281
- What? - I said I'm going to forgive you.

470
00:37:53,427 --> 00:37:54,722
Who do you think you are?

471
00:37:55,427 --> 00:37:57,222
Someone who wants to love you.

472
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:04,662
Love begins with forgiveness.

473
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:10,472
What a joke. That good-for-nothing human thinks she can forgive me.

474
00:38:12,846 --> 00:38:13,941
I know.

475
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:17,372
Plus, love starts with hate.

476
00:38:20,286 --> 00:38:21,456
But then again,

477
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:23,582
I guess you need to hate someone in order to forgive them.

478
00:38:25,857 --> 00:38:27,381
I'm not going to forgive you.

479
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:29,352
I just decided to call a truce today.

480
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:32,961
I know you have nobody to talk to.

481
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:35,162
It's the same with me.

482
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:44,941
Tak Dong Kyung is really starting to get on my nerves.

483
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:51,111
The wall looks pretty with all those drawings.

484
00:39:27,487 --> 00:39:30,352
I guess Ji Na was right.

485
00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:50,332
Who...

486
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:53,202
I was scared for nothing.

487
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,772
- What is it? - You were scared?

488
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:59,211
Why? Did you do something bad?

489
00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:01,257
Did you fight with my brother-in-law?

490
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:02,817
He's not your brother-in-law.

491
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,582
You should've called before coming here.

492
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:05,852
Why?

493
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:07,487
Is my brother-in-law on his way?

494
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:09,757
My gosh, cut it out.

495
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:10,757
Gosh.

496
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:12,897
You never go anywhere during the weekends.

497
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:14,321
So I thought I'd drop by.

498
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:17,861
Hey, do you think...

499
00:40:18,936 --> 00:40:20,531
you can lend me some money?

500
00:40:21,107 --> 00:40:22,177
What?

501
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:24,407
Why? What kind of trouble did you get yourself into this time?

502
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:26,801
No, I didn't get myself in any trouble.

503
00:40:27,306 --> 00:40:28,742
I want to take lessons.

504
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:30,246
- Lessons? - Yes.

505
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:31,682
I want to get a license.

506
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:35,281
A personal color consultant. It's a popular job these days.

507
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:38,386
Sun Kyung, what's your major?

508
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:40,927
Leisure sports. But I really have what it takes.

509
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:42,897
Ever since I was young, I was very sensitive...

510
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:45,397
about choosing the right colors for my clothes. You know that right?

511
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:46,897
Just get lost if you're here to talk nonsense.

512
00:40:46,897 --> 00:40:48,266
I'm tired.

513
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:50,531
I don't want to listen to your nonsense on a weekend.

514
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,266
"Nonsense"?

515
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:56,507
I paid for your computer lessons, and you got addicted to games.

516
00:40:56,507 --> 00:40:58,346
I paid for your cooking lessons, but you quit saying you got fat.

517
00:40:58,346 --> 00:40:59,746
I paid for your jujitsu lessons, but you gave up...

518
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:01,246
saying it hurt whenever someone hit you.

519
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:02,441
You're seriously...

520
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:06,711
Will you keep living like this even after I die?

521
00:41:07,746 --> 00:41:08,857
Just forget it if you don't want to lend me money.

522
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:10,752
You don't need to suddenly start talking about death.

523
00:41:11,987 --> 00:41:14,321
Forget it. I never should've asked.

524
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:18,067
What would you know? You don't even have a dream.

525
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:19,162
What?

526
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,662
Don't you know whose fault that is?

527
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:26,861
Are you saying it's my fault?

528
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,837
Why else do you think I'm working so hard...

529
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:30,136
instead of having a dream of my own?

530
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:31,507
If you don't like your job, then just quit.

531
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:33,242
Just quit your job already.

532
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:36,272
- Why are you blaming it on me? - Then what?

533
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:38,916
How will I be able to take care of you?

534
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,542
Who asked you to take care of me?

535
00:41:41,087 --> 00:41:42,981
I can take care of myself.

536
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:45,452
You got that job because you wanted to.

537
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,252
- What? - Stop blaming it on me.

538
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:50,222
You're not the only orphan.

539
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:51,792
I'm an orphan too.

540
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:55,761
But I still have a dream.

541
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,131
I have something I want to do.

542
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:01,231
Forget it. There's no point in talking to you.

543
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,202
You won't ever understand.

544
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:05,341
I don't understand you either.

545
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,511
Forget it. I'll deal with it.

546
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,941
I don't ever want to live like you.

547
00:42:11,186 --> 00:42:13,217
Hey. What did you just say?

548
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:14,317
- Get off. - Hey.

549
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:15,481
You asked me to leave.

550
00:42:18,757 --> 00:42:20,921
Hey... Let me see. Are you okay?

551
00:42:25,797 --> 00:42:26,921
Forget it.

552
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:28,662
Hey...

553
00:42:38,346 --> 00:42:40,102
I guess love isn't that big of a deal.

554
00:42:45,516 --> 00:42:47,642
He meant everything he said.

555
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,182
I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

556
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,027
I just think he was too harsh.

557
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:56,292
You're trying so hard to make a living for him.

558
00:42:59,096 --> 00:43:00,961
That's none of your business.

559
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,662
Why? Are you going to be forgiving again?

560
00:43:04,436 --> 00:43:05,832
I think you have the wrong idea.

561
00:43:06,507 --> 00:43:08,702
That the person who forgives is kinder.

562
00:43:09,476 --> 00:43:11,272
That being kind wins.

563
00:43:14,976 --> 00:43:17,016
I guess that bothered you.

564
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:18,886
Sorry. Satisfied?

565
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:21,981
That's right. You bother me. You keep bothering me.

566
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:25,122
Fine.

567
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:27,921
Please stop for today.

568
00:43:28,797 --> 00:43:31,191
What will happen if I kill him right now?

569
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:33,567
There are many ways.

570
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:36,191
I can throw one of the many dooms lingering out there on him.

571
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:38,662
Would you still forgive me?

572
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:40,531
Can you still love me?

573
00:43:44,177 --> 00:43:46,171
Take back what you said.

574
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:48,941
Why are you mad? I'm just curious, that's all.

575
00:43:54,857 --> 00:43:56,381
Take it back.

576
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:03,452
Do you know how many stars collapse every second?

577
00:44:04,797 --> 00:44:06,697
7.9 billion per second.

578
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:07,921
What makes you special?

579
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,361
Are you better than those stars?

580
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:11,961
Tell me.

581
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:14,461
Why should you live?

582
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:21,571
You just happened to be there.

583
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:25,182
It's like I want to throw a stone into a calm lake,

584
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:28,011
and you happen to be the closest stone.

585
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:32,352
A convenient coincidence.

586
00:44:34,857 --> 00:44:36,921
I wish you'd die.

587
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,821
I wish...

588
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:44,492
you'd die. I wish you'd experience it.

589
00:44:45,436 --> 00:44:47,401
Because then you'd understand how I feel.

590
00:44:50,877 --> 00:44:52,002
Really?

591
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,892
If that's your wish.

592
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,401
Make your wish come true.

593
00:45:40,357 --> 00:45:42,252
It's a wish I can't grant.

594
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:58,071
I would've died long ago if I were capable of dying.

595
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:03,372
If I can't kill you,

596
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:06,841
I'll at least make you miserable.

597
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:10,312
So that you can live in misery for all eternity.

598
00:46:10,717 --> 00:46:13,381
Try it. Do it if you can.

599
00:46:27,636 --> 00:46:31,002
But you're miserable immediately if I don't hold your hand.

600
00:46:39,186 --> 00:46:40,281
Hey!

601
00:48:22,186 --> 00:48:26,151
I did it, and I have to fix it in this life.

602
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:29,752
No one takes care of me in this life.

603
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:34,492
"I won't do anything. I won't even try."

604
00:48:35,366 --> 00:48:39,461
"I'll... I'll just stay still."

605
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:44,602
My life had been a series of doing nothing.

606
00:48:50,147 --> 00:48:52,142
I shouldn't have tried...

607
00:48:52,987 --> 00:48:56,611
to feel compassion or love.

608
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:04,352
Humans are insignificant.

609
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:10,792
You're no different.

610
00:49:16,507 --> 00:49:19,102
You are no different.

611
00:49:27,246 --> 00:49:28,711
(Defense Counsel)

612
00:49:29,186 --> 00:49:31,116
Thus, the prosecution requests...

613
00:49:31,116 --> 00:49:34,722
that the defendant be sentenced to life in prison.

614
00:49:34,886 --> 00:49:36,022
I rest my case.

615
00:49:36,427 --> 00:49:38,151
Just execute me!

616
00:49:38,427 --> 00:49:41,627
Execute me! Execute me!

617
00:49:41,627 --> 00:49:43,691
Kill me now!

618
00:49:44,797 --> 00:49:45,901
Silence!

619
00:49:47,337 --> 00:49:48,602
I'm right.

620
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:51,107
Humans are still insignificant.

621
00:49:51,107 --> 00:49:52,301
Give it back!

622
00:49:55,317 --> 00:49:57,941
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

623
00:49:58,987 --> 00:50:02,781
I'm sorry! I said I'm sorry! Kill me!

624
00:50:03,357 --> 00:50:05,685
Give it back!

625
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:06,881
You...

626
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:13,892
No!

627
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:16,536
Kill me! Kill me!

628
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:18,131
Please kill me!

629
00:50:19,237 --> 00:50:20,602
Kill me!

630
00:50:20,636 --> 00:50:21,972
Please kill me!

631

(Tak Brother)

634
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:51,303
Hey...

635
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:53,503
This is Seoul Sun Ho Hospital.

636
00:50:53,504 --> 00:50:55,568
Are you Tak Sun Kyung's guardian?

637
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,878
No.

638
00:51:11,323 --> 00:51:13,349
Taxi. Taxi.

639
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:15,588
I had a flashback.

640
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:20,193
Hello?

641
00:51:20,194 --> 00:51:22,203
Is there an adult at home?

642
00:51:22,203 --> 00:51:24,303
Mom and Dad will be home soon.

643
00:51:24,303 --> 00:51:25,528
Who's this?

644
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,298
This is Tak Jong Won and Kang Soo Ha's home, right?

645
00:51:28,343 --> 00:51:31,044
This is a hospital. There's been an accident.

646
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:33,238
Is there an adult I can call?

647
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:35,738
Hello?

648
00:51:35,913 --> 00:51:39,449
That first moment my life started...

649
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:41,584
to become cruel.

650
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:43,918
Please drive quickly. Please.

651
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:52,028
Will that do?

652
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:55,258
- Thank you so much. - I'll be back.

653
00:52:04,774 --> 00:52:07,884
(Building 3, Lower, 5)

654
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:09,278
It's all because of that jerk.

655
00:52:10,643 --> 00:52:12,079
I'll get him.

656
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:14,949
I'm going to kill that jerk.

- Let go of me. Let me go! - Hurry!

I'm going to kill that jerk!

00:53:06,134 --> 00:53:07,769
What are you doing there?

670
00:53:10,373 --> 00:53:11,568
What am I doing?

671
00:53:12,214 --> 00:53:13,468
I'm looking at trees.

672
00:53:14,884 --> 00:53:16,309
Can you see that tree over there?

673
00:53:16,714 --> 00:53:17,979
The leaves are all dead.

674
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:20,778
No, no.

675
00:53:20,913 --> 00:53:24,849
Let's not do this. We should talk this out.

676
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:28,588
We're both doctors. I'm sure we can see eye to eye on things.

677
00:53:28,763 --> 00:53:30,588
Which department are you in?

678
00:53:32,694 --> 00:53:36,258
Oh, right. Did you lose one of your patients?

679
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:38,128
Is that why you're doing this?

680
00:53:39,703 --> 00:53:43,099
I've experienced that too. I know how that feels.

681
00:53:44,614 --> 00:53:46,639
- You do? - Yes.

682
00:53:46,743 --> 00:53:48,614
I've had my fair share of losing patients...

683
00:53:48,614 --> 00:53:50,778
and the pain that comes with it.

684
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:55,053
So why don't you come down first? Let's talk about this.

685
00:53:55,053 --> 00:53:57,754
People died and disappeared from the world because of me,

686
00:53:57,754 --> 00:53:59,449
and those people keep watching me.

687
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:03,258
Does that happen to you too?

688
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:05,429
Yes!

689
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:07,229
It happens to me too.

690
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:09,464
It still happens now.

691
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:12,734
It's tough. We all want to save our patients so badly.

692
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:14,968
I'm in the same boat.

693
00:54:15,303 --> 00:54:16,798
No, not even close.

694
00:54:17,303 --> 00:54:18,809
I want to end everything.

695
00:54:20,214 --> 00:54:21,608
No.

696
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,909
Come down from there.

697
00:54:24,814 --> 00:54:26,679
Come down.

698
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:28,619
Should I?

699
00:54:33,123 --> 00:54:34,254
I'll come down.

700
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,519
Okay. Good choice.

(Emergency Medical Center)

702
00:55:02,323 --> 00:55:03,584
I'm here for Tak Sun Kyung.

703
00:55:03,584 --> 00:55:05,154
Where's he right now?

704
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:06,749
You can check inside.

705
00:55:08,524 --> 00:55:10,488
I bet my sister will get so scared and run to the ER.

706
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:12,628
I'm 100 percent sure.

707
00:55:12,694 --> 00:55:14,364
She was mean to me before.

708
00:55:14,364 --> 00:55:15,898
I bet she's going crazy right now.

709
00:55:16,433 --> 00:55:18,869
Hey, let's sign up as soon as she gives me the money.

710
00:55:20,473 --> 00:55:21,639
Exactly.

711
00:55:27,944 --> 00:55:29,183
(Absolute Rest)

712
00:55:29,183 --> 00:55:30,278
Dong Kyung.

713
00:55:31,714 --> 00:55:33,079
Dong Kyung!

714
00:55:34,854 --> 00:55:36,979
Big Sis! Tak Dong Kyung!

715
00:55:38,393 --> 00:55:40,249
Big Sis! Tak Dong Kyung!

716
00:55:41,663 --> 00:55:43,889
Wait. Are you...

717
00:55:44,223 --> 00:55:46,294
Ms. Tak's family?

718
00:55:46,294 --> 00:55:47,389
Pardon?

719
00:55:48,464 --> 00:55:49,659
Well, yes.

720
00:55:50,533 --> 00:55:51,798
I'm her brother.

(Building 3, Lower, 5)

723
00:56:21,663 --> 00:56:22,959
Are you following me?

724
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:25,128
No way. I'm very busy.

725
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:29,599
Pretending to be a doctor that saves people must be fun for you.

726
00:56:30,743 --> 00:56:32,008
It's not boring.

(Emergency Medical Center)

728
00:56:50,123 --> 00:56:51,218
Move!

729
00:56:51,763 --> 00:56:53,389
Die!

730
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:29,258
At this rate, she only has three months to live at most.

731
00:57:30,604 --> 00:57:32,628
She must get treated right now.

732
00:57:55,864 --> 00:57:58,188
Can someone call this in?

733
00:57:58,734 --> 00:57:59,889
Your hand...

734
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:03,459
Let go!

735
00:58:09,373 --> 00:58:10,599
Don't move.

736
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:21,818
- What just happened? - Don't look.

737
00:58:22,924 --> 00:58:24,318
It's not even worth it.

738
00:58:25,524 --> 00:58:27,188
Don't move. Stop!

739
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:28,588
Get away from me!

740
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,809
I'll give back...

741
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:48,209
what I took from you.

742
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,933
- What just happened? - Oh, my gosh!

743
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:11,199
I need some help here!

744
00:59:11,433 --> 00:59:13,604
- Oh, my. - Did you see that?

745
00:59:13,604 --> 00:59:14,829
I told you.

746
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,508
It's impossible to love me.

747
00:59:26,453 --> 00:59:28,648
Everyone either resents me or wants me.

748
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:30,378
Or...

749
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:39,829
some fear me.

(Doom at Your Service)

751
01:00:35,754 --> 01:00:37,119
I want to know too.

752
01:00:37,183 --> 01:00:40,019
So you should just thank me too.

753
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,258
Did it really mean nothing?

754
01:00:42,424 --> 01:00:44,659
Are you out of your mind? Why are you here?

755
01:00:45,393 --> 01:00:46,659
Is Lee Hyun Kyu coming too?

756
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:48,829
Don't see him.

757
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:51,829
How long have you been following me?

758
01:00:52,303 --> 01:00:54,199
Do you think it will go as planned?

759
01:00:54,803 --> 01:00:56,544
If you can make a wish before dying,

760
01:00:56,544 --> 01:00:57,544
what would you wish for?

761
01:00:57,544 --> 01:00:59,039
I have a good idea.

762
01:00:59,814 --> 01:01:02,238
Make a wish to fall in love with me.
