00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:16,054
(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

2
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:18,624
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:53,324
The deity is on my side.

4
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:57,163
Choose. Will you die here and now?

5
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,803
Or will you take my hand?

6
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:06,044
And the answer is...

7
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:08,113
Me.

8
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:33,123
Don't let go.

9
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:38,004
Don't let go unless you want to die right now.

10
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:54,143
(Episode 2)

11
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:57,523
How is this possible?

12
00:02:58,123 --> 00:02:59,784
All we did was go back in time.

13
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:02,954
- It's nothing that grand. - Not that.

14
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,363
Your...

15
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:08,993
How do I put it?

16
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:12,563
I'm searching for a term that won't sound rude.

17
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,333
- My identity? - Yes.

18
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:18,004
Are you suspicious or curious?

19
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,504
Neither. I'm simply being rational.

20
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:21,974
But you saw earlier.

21
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:23,713
You experienced it first hand. Accept it.

22
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:24,914
That's easier said than done.

23
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,083
- You're alive right now. - So?

24
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,884
It was Switzerland and then Italy outside your door.

25
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:31,683
So?

26
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,183
In your dream, on the subway, and at work.

27
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:35,354
Don't you remember?

28
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:38,424
I do remember. But it makes no sense.

29
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,034
I feel like I've gone insane.

30
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,404
Okay. Watch.

31
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:48,834
What?

32
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:53,203
- Oh my gosh. - Did the lights go out?

33
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:55,313
What's wrong with this?

34
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:58,914
What about this?

35
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,553
That's odd. What's going on?

36
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:04,724
A timely coincidence?

37
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:10,493
- What's going on? - My phone turned off.

38
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:12,794
- Why did it suddenly turn off? - It won't work.

39
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:15,363
Did the battery die?

40
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:19,034
A timely coincidence?

41
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:21,703
I see.

42
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:26,044
Are you an electric type?

43
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:36,584
- Look. - What's that in the sky?

44
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:39,354
Are they comets?

45
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:40,784
My gosh.

46
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:46,993
Comets out of the blue?

47
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:49,294
Okay. I get it, so stop.

48
00:04:49,294 --> 00:04:51,933
Why? I didn't do that.

49
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:54,303
I'm an electric type.

50
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,904
I said to stop it.

51
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,003
Stop it.

52
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,484
What's going on?

53
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:11,053
The power's back.

54
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,453
I'm not very nice.

55
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:15,894
My phone turned back on too.

56
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,964
That's with whom you entered into a contract.

57
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:20,464
Remember that I'm evil.

58
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:41,553
I need to stop fooling around, and go.

59
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:44,584
- All of a sudden? - Something annoying happened.

60
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:47,253
Consider that a show to commemorate our contract.

61
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:49,693
I hope you enjoy yourself.

62
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:06,943
You didn't want to hold it before. Now, you don't want to let go?

63
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,844
You said not to let go.

64
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:25,063
- What's this? - My promise.

65
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:27,123
I said I'd make sure you don't feel pain.

66
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,133
Don't relax too much.

67
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:38,003
You have to recharge it once a day before midnight.

68
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:39,803
Recharge it? How?

69
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:41,873
- By holding my hand. - What? Why?

70
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:43,144
In case you run away.

71
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:52,484
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyung.

72
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:56,524
Hey. How do you know my name?

73
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:57,524
Hey!

74
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:14,443
Excuse me.

75
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:16,313
Yes?

76
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:18,883
Do you remember the crosswalk earlier?

77
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:23,154
- You don't remember? - No, I don't.

78
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:26,683
I guess it really didn't happen.

79
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:06,624
You're such high maintenance.

80
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,504
I'll kill you in due time.

81
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:29,614
I said not to park your car in my spot,

82
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:31,823
but you keep trying.

83
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,284
Doom is my domain.

84
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:38,994
Do something.

85
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,994
I keep hearing the voices.

86
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:45,703
I can't sleep. It's driving me crazy.

87
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:48,603
- Die. - You piece of trash.

88
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,573
- Stop. - Coward.

89
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,774
- Die. - He deserves to die.

90
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:53,044
Die, you murderer.

91
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:54,514
- Coward. - Die.

92
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:56,213
He should be ripped apart!

93
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:57,914
- Die! - Die.

94
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,943
How does it feel?

95
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,914
I deal with it every day.

96
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:04,784
Please kill me! I'm begging you!

97
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,254
Three of the people you stabbed died.

98
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:11,723
Two of them are still in a coma.

99
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,833
But you're alive and well. You should thank me.

100
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:17,593
That wasn't my plan.

101
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,433
It wasn't.

102
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:23,174
Life doesn't go as planned.

103
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:25,103
I'll stop here for today.

104
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:28,374
I got a good contract today, so I'm feeling chipper.

105
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:31,174
Who are you?

106
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:32,843
Have you ever heard this phrase?

107
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:37,183
"I am the first and the last, the beginning and the end."

108
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:44,453
I'm that. The last. The end.

109
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,034
Hey!

110
00:09:57,274 --> 00:10:00,904
Why are you doing this to me? What do you want?

111
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:03,014
Doom.

112
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:11,053
(Jo Scum)

113
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,353
Why is he calling me?

114
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:28,803
Hey. I know you won't believe what I'm about to tell you,

115
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:31,203
but hear me out without giving me lip...

116
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:32,203
Hello?

117
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:34,504
Ji Na!

118
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:36,674
Ji Na!

119
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:38,784
What's wrong?

120
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,713
What is it? What's wrong?

121
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:42,614
I'm going to die.

122
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:45,884
- What? - I'm going to die!

123
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:48,053
Why?

124
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,764
Wait. Don't tell me...

125
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:57,063
I lost it all.

126
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,904
It's divine will.

127
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:08,213
My writing was garbage, so the powers at be deleted it.

128
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:13,044
They should've done it before I finished it.

129
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:14,754
What was with those comets?

130
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,384
What was with the power outage?

131
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:20,953
What else?

132
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,323
It's a sign that I should die.

133
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:29,463
Take care. Goodbye.

134
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,134
Why should you die?

135
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,904
This is all that jerk's fault.

136
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:40,603
That jerk?

137
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:43,914
Who? Bill Gates?

138
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:47,213
Just someone. Anyway.

139
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:48,983
Ji Na.

140
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,823
Sit down for now. Okay?

141
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:54,254
Stop acting like an amateur.

142
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:57,223
You know better than anyone what you must do in this situation.

143
00:11:57,794 --> 00:12:00,124
No, I don't. Should I die?

144
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:05,634
There is only one solution, Ms. Na.

145
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:07,833
What?

146
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,703
Write it all again within an hour.

147
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:10,973
What? My suicide note?

148
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:12,904
The chapter.

149
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:14,843
The chapter?

150
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:18,244
I'm going to the roof.

151
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:20,044
Finish your chapter first.

152
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,713
What's the point though?

153
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:22,983
No one likes it.

154
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:26,124
They don't like it much at the company either, right?

155
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:29,154
What did they say? Be honest.

156
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:31,664
It's boring.

157
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,134
I don't think romance is her forte.

158
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:36,963
The male protagonist is too bland.

159
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:38,634
The number of reads keeps dropping.

160
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:41,203
But once readers have to pay to read a story,

161
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:43,634
the number drops to half on average...

162
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:46,244
Jung Min, would you go out with that male protagonist?

163
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:48,544
- Excuse me? - Not me.

164
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:50,874
I'll ask her to reduce the number of chapters...

165
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,114
and to end it sooner.

166
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:54,953
Sure. Let's end this one.

167
00:12:54,953 --> 00:12:56,884
Let's see how she does on her next story.

168
00:12:58,223 --> 00:13:00,183
They said it's worth waiting and seeing.

169
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:03,093
Don't lie to me! The number of reads dropped to half.

170
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:06,124
Half the readers stop reading...

171
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:08,233
once they have to pay for the chapters.

172
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,864
That's true.

173
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:15,733
So let's just write, okay?

174
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:18,703
If you miss the upload time,

175
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:21,244
you'll lose the remaining half too.

176
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:22,813
Here.

177
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,313
Did you eat?

178
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:32,453
That's not real food.

179
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:33,723
This is filling.

180
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:36,323
I have no time to write, let alone cook.

181
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:38,364
This is much better than anything I cook...

182
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:39,593
in both taste and nutrition.

183
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:02,514
Ji Na...

184
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:07,183
Where do I even start?

185
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,524
What? Did you say something?

186
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:16,394
I'm going to run to the convenience store.

187
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:17,794
Okay.

188
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,343
Hello.

189
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:36,053
(Mr. Jung Dang Myun)

190
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:39,853
Hello, Mr. Jung. May I help you with something?

191
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:42,223
You're the one who needs help, Ms. Tak Dong Kyung.

192
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,563
Why are you full-naming me?

193
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:51,364
Was there an error with the upload?

194
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:52,463
Are you even scared?

195
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,073
I'm calling as a doctor, not a writer.

196
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:57,674
I'm calling to threaten you.

197
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:01,774
I see. That.

198
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:03,614
You may feel fine now,

199
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:05,514
but it'll become so painful that you'll want to die.

200
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:07,144
This isn't a threat, it's a fact.

201
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,514
Will it keep getting worse?

202
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:11,483
Are you kidding me?

203
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:21,733
In other words, do I want to die after suffering tremendous pain...

204
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:26,103
or after suffering slightly milder than tremendous pain.

205
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:28,933
I have to choose one or the other, right?

206
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,073
I don't want either.

207
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:34,044
Don't think of doing anything rash.

208
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:35,973
Don't do that.

209
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,414
I already did something rash.

210
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:55,894
I don't regret it.

211
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,303
Doom is knocking at the door.

212
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:05,803
Repent and be saved.

213
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:09,014
(The world is coming to an end.)

214
00:16:09,544 --> 00:16:11,343
- It is? - Yes.

215
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,414
The countless evil deeds that we've committed...

216
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:15,853
angered the Almighty.

217
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:17,754
For example,

218
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:20,424
the comets today were proof that the end is near.

219
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:23,293
Doom is coming. It's knocking at our door.

220
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,664
(The world is coming to an end.)

221
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:29,594
You're right.

222
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:39,273
The Almighty is angry. Doom is drawing near.

223
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:49,953
Are you angry?

224
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:52,283
I'm feeling fine today.

225
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:53,824
Maybe you will be angry soon.

226
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,493
You said to become a human's wish.

227
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:03,164
But that human's wish happens to be doom.

228
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:06,864
- That's amusing. - Isn't it?

229
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:10,104
Until now, humans only wished to win the lottery,

230
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:13,243
for their health or happiness, and things like that.

231
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:16,614
Do you know? If the garden is gone...

232
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:18,543
The gardener and the butterfly won't be needed anymore.

233
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:40,064
At least respond.

234
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:45,304
Do what you want. I plan to do what I want too.

235
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:51,513
Tell me this one thing.

236
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,414
Why me?

237
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:57,683
Who knows?

238
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:01,183
Fate?

239
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:06,693
That's cruel.

240
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:15,334
Fate is cruel to everyone.

241
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:22,213
You'll be punished if you do something bad.

242
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:28,783
I'm already being punished.

243
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:51,674
(Jo Scum)

244
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:53,904
You're screening my calls?

245
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:55,844
You'll regret it.

246
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,144
(You're screening my calls? You'll regret it.)

247
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:01,483
(You're screening my calls? You'll regret it.)

248
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,783
I said you'd regret it.

249
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:16,594
Ji Na, I need to rush back into the office.

250
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,503
Sorry. I'll buy dinner tomorrow.

251
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:19,503
What?

252
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:21,404
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

253
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:23,834
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

254
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:27,174
Tak Dong Kyung, who works here,

255
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:28,973
is a homewrecker.

256
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:31,943
She seduced me, a well-behaved, happily married man!

257
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:32,943
Seduced?

258
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:34,884
That doesn't belong in the same sentence as "Do Kyung".

259
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,683
The naive man that I am, I fell for it.

260
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:37,683
Naive?

261
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:40,683
And I ended up losing my precious wife!

262
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,223
How could this happen?

263
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:45,293
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

264
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:47,424
Excuse me. You can't do this in our office.

265
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:49,733
- Get out. - I'm angry, that's why.

266
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:50,733
Get out.

267
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,003
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

268
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:55,033
Let's talk outside.

269
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:58,033
You are just incredible.

270
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:01,003
How can you eat after ruining my life?

271
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:02,844
I said let's talk outside.

272
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:04,114
Forget it.

273
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:07,043
What did you say to my wife?

274
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:09,713
What did you say that she wants a divorce?

275
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:16,924
"I didn't know he was married."

276
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:18,763
"I was deceived."

277
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:20,824
"I did nothing wrong."

278
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:22,834
"He's the one who was wrong."

279
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,904
That's what I said. So?

280
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,463
I am dumbfounded.

281
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:32,104
Hey. It wasn't love for me.

282
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:33,743
How do I put it?

283
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:36,144
It just happened.

284
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:39,644
Even if we end it, we should have manners!

285
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:40,943
Manners?

286
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:42,783
You're talking about manners?

287
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,783
That's right! Manners! M-A-N-E-R!

288
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:46,183
M-A-N-N-E-R.

289
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:50,054
To be honest, what do you have to offer?

290
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,523
You don't have anything everyone else has.

291
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:54,293
You have no parents or money. What do you have?

292
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:01,604
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyung.

293
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:06,043
Should I make that wish right now?

294
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:07,604
What?

295
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:10,414
Forget it.

296
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:13,614
It'll be too much of a waste to use it on the likes of you.

297
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:16,953
Is this the time?

298
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:19,453
Is this the time for what?

299
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:21,253
Doom.

300
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,324
What are you babbling about?

301
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,293
I'm saying I want to kill you.

302
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:31,933
You can tell when someone grew up with no parents...

303
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,263
in these situations.

304
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:34,804
This is why...

305
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:36,574
I won't let my child grow up without a dad!

306
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:37,634
Excuse me!

307
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,404
Excuse me. From what I can see,

308
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:41,904
you're the highest up here.

309
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:43,844
It's extremely bad for the company image...

310
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,614
to have an employee like her.

311
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:48,483
So... Wait. Hold on.

312
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:50,884
Darn it.

313
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:53,884
Don't let outsiders in so easily.

314
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:03,394
Is everyone okay?

315
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:05,463
I think the lunch gave me indigestion.

316
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,574
Fire the homewrecker...

317
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:11,404
Tak Dong Kyung! Fire her!

318
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,243
- I'm this nitwit's wife. - What...

319
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:16,043
- Everything he says is a lie. - Honey.

320
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,713
- Sorry for the trouble. - Wait.

321
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:20,043
I was about to leave. You have the wrong idea.

322
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:21,243
- Hey. - Let's go.

323
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:23,953
Honey, the baby. Be careful of the baby.

324
00:22:23,953 --> 00:22:25,314
Hey, you, Dong Kyung!

325
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:27,253
Hold on. Honey!

326
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:29,554
I'll kill you!

327
00:22:29,953 --> 00:22:31,793
- Darn it. - Shut it!

328
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:36,293
Wow. Gosh.

329
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,414
("Life" group chat)

330
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:29,453
(I'm staring at the clock. I'm getting coffee.)

331
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:32,324
Big news. You'll never guess what happened in our office.

332
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:37,693
If I hear anyone typing, I will kill you.

333
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,533
Hey!

334
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:48,203
It wasn't me.

335
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:09,854
(Resignation)

336
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:13,824
I'll resign.

337
00:24:14,564 --> 00:24:16,193
I don't have the authority.

338
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:18,634
Mr. Park isn't in right now.

339
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:20,564
Please submit it for me.

340
00:24:20,564 --> 00:24:21,664
I can't be bothered.

341
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:24,634
And it isn't business hours yet.

342
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:29,273
- When will Mr. Park be back? - I don't know.

343
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:31,074
Excuse me?

344
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:34,884
He went to Bali with his girlfriend to celebrate making up.

345
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,263
Bali to make it up to my queen.

346
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:48,124
A man in charge of a company.

347
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:53,033
However, for tonight, a man who exists for one woman.

348
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:55,134
Looking good, sir.

349
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:57,503
Enjoy your vacation.

350
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:59,904
Enjoy a long vacation, sir.

351
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:05,074
(Like)

352
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:30,033
Recharge.

353
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:34,443
Why couldn't you cross the street?

354
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:37,973
- I was too scared. - Then you should've called me.

355
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:40,114
- How? - However.

356
00:25:40,483 --> 00:25:41,814
You sound like you're on my side.

357
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:43,854
That's all in your head.

358
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:45,753
How was your day?

359
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:47,854
Why are you asking that?

360
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,354
Who knows?

361
00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:51,253
You may want to bring doom today.

362
00:25:51,723 --> 00:25:53,124
That will make things easier.

363
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:56,793
I have a question.

364
00:25:57,894 --> 00:26:00,104
What happens if I break this contract?

365
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,374
If you break it?

366
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:06,174
What if I don't feel pain until I die and get my wish,

367
00:26:06,543 --> 00:26:08,914
but I die without asking you to end this world?

368
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:15,884
Will you do that?

369
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:24,523
Then someone else will die instead of you.

370
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:27,324
The person you love the most at that moment.

371
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:31,834
What? What do you...

372
00:26:32,263 --> 00:26:34,503
I'll remove the doom from here to there.

373
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:37,433
It's simple.

374
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:39,773
That's not what you promised.

375
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,443
I made no promise.

376
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:43,243
All contracts have penalties for breaches.

377
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:47,114
I don't know. Regardless, you've entered into a contract.

378
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:48,314
It's a done deal.

379
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:53,884
You fraud.

380
00:26:57,453 --> 00:26:59,463
Would it have been different if you had known?

381
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:07,404
I doubt that.

382
00:27:23,054 --> 00:27:24,753
Okay. I'll be fair.

383
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:26,953
I'll give you another chance to choose.

384
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:28,084
What will you do now?

385
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:33,993
Choose quickly. You'll die at that rate.

386
00:27:33,993 --> 00:27:34,993
Hey.

387
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,834
When you gain something, you must lose something.

388
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,064
Think hard.

389
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:41,033
Everything you've gained in life were thanks to things you lost.

390
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:42,834
Why?

391
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,174
Why me?

392
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:48,104
Why? Why must it be me?

393
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:56,213
Fate.

394
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:02,453
That's cruel.

395
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,463
Fate is cruel to everyone.

396
00:28:20,703 --> 00:28:22,374
Stop! Stop it!

397
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,124
See?

398
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:49,874
Scumbag.

399
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:54,473
I've heard that so much.

400
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:57,074
Is it fun toying with me?

401
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:00,443
Like I said, I'm not on your side.

402
00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:02,854
It was your choice.

403
00:29:03,753 --> 00:29:06,554
And naturally, I will always respect your decision.

404
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:13,463
Will you keep standing here?

405
00:29:15,394 --> 00:29:17,763
Fine, suit yourself. I'm going to cross.

406
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:20,003
It's getting boring.

407
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:51,193
Why?

408
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:56,273
Why me?

409
00:29:56,473 --> 00:29:59,243
Why? Why must it be me?

410
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:01,743
Why me?

411
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:04,943
Fate?

412
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:07,844
That's cruel.

413
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:32,804
Dong Kyung!

414
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:34,773
I got your favourite rice cake.

415
00:30:35,844 --> 00:30:37,674
Look. I bought a lot.

416
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:42,713
Then someone else will die instead of you.

417
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:45,354
The person you love the most at that moment.

418
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:52,824
What's wrong?

419
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,793
I took care of the insurance matter.

420
00:30:58,564 --> 00:30:59,703
It turned out...

421
00:30:59,703 --> 00:31:02,773
the owner of the rental car company was my classmate's brother's...

422
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:05,574
distant aunt's fourth cousin...

423
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:10,144
Anyway, it was someone I knew so I got it resolved.

424
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:11,174
It's true!

425
00:31:15,084 --> 00:31:16,453
What's wrong?

426
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:18,884
Were you drinking?

427
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:22,993
Did you come up with a new way to kill me?

428
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:25,894
Dong Kyung.

429
00:32:11,703 --> 00:32:14,003
Excuse me. One roll of gimbap please.

430
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:15,043
Okay.

431
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:18,973
That's a dollar. Thank you.

432
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:21,884
I'm so angry.

433
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:25,783
The most important thing is to keep them wanting more.

434
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:27,424
You have to play hard to get.

435
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:31,324
That way, the readers will wonder what happens to the characters...

436
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,664
and will drool and follow us.

437
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:35,564
Know what I mean?

438
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:39,404
It should be like a skirt that you can almost look up.

439
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:43,634
A shirt?

440
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:48,374
Does the author Lee Hyun not go to the office much?

441
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,374
Pardon?

442
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:55,013
I hear she's really pretty.

443
00:32:55,384 --> 00:32:57,154
I hear you two are close.

444
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:58,783
Let me meet her.

445
00:32:58,783 --> 00:32:59,783
Who knows?

446
00:32:59,783 --> 00:33:01,654
Writers get each other.

447
00:33:01,654 --> 00:33:03,154
If we hit it off,

448
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:04,253
we may...

449
00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:06,223
You know.

450
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:10,164
People need to know their place.

451
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:12,493
What?

452
00:33:16,134 --> 00:33:17,203
Him.

453
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,533
This wrinkly old man...

454
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,304
doesn't know his place and does what he does.

455
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:22,503
Did you do that on purpose?

456
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:23,873
Does he die later on?

457
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:29,483
That has nothing to do with social perspective.

458
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:32,514
It's a set-up to accentuate a truly pure, innocent love.

459
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:34,483
That's the kind of jerk...

460
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:37,494
that lies about his marital status to lure an ordinary single woman.

461
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:38,893
What?

462
00:33:39,623 --> 00:33:42,494
Why does social perspective have nothing to do with love?

463
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:44,864
Love that goes beyond social perspective is a crime.

464
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:47,003
Is he a criminal?

465
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:49,603
Ms. Tak. How can you say that?

466
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:51,204
What's wrong?

467
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:54,603
I'm in awe because your writing is so realistic.

468
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:58,373
You weren't like this.

469
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:01,514
People who suddenly change die soon.

470
00:34:01,514 --> 00:34:03,313
Is this because I asked about Lee Hyun?

471
00:34:03,313 --> 00:34:06,583
No. It's because my time's almost up.

472
00:34:07,483 --> 00:34:10,793
I'm already wondering if it's today or tomorrow.

473
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:12,994
What? Where are you going when we're still talking?

474
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:16,063
I'm off to see the pretty Lee Hyun.

475
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:28,904
- It's because of a man. - A man?

476
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:32,174
What man? I don't even know a male insect.

477
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:34,213
Think carefully.

478
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:36,614
He's very close to water.

479
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:37,753
Water?

480
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:42,523
He's standing right in your way.

481
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:45,753
You're being dragged down by a ghost that drowned!

482
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:51,494
You can't change your pen name now.

483
00:34:51,494 --> 00:34:53,934
The fortune-teller told me to get rid of everything about him.

484
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,574
- Thanks. I'll enjoy the food. - Sure.

485
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,134
Why did I take his name as my pen name?

486
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,244
And why did he have to swim?

487
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,213
It's really chilling.

488
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:04,974
How did she know about water?

489
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:06,784
Ji Na, who is this fortune-teller?

490
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:09,954
Why? Is something not working out?

491
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:12,353
Work's a problem.

492
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:13,853
Will you change jobs?

493
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:15,753
Do it. If you don't like it, jump ship.

494
00:35:15,753 --> 00:35:17,324
There are many other publishers.

495
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:19,864
I don't exactly want to jump ship.

496
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,634
- Tak. - What?

497
00:35:27,663 --> 00:35:28,704
Should I...

498
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:31,333
quit writing?

499
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:33,074
Ji Na!

500
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:34,704
I'll cook the rice for you.

501
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:57,233
You can eat once the cheese melts.

502
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:02,804
Ji Na.

503
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:06,174
What do you want to do if you die in 100 days?

504
00:36:06,174 --> 00:36:07,574
Why? Am I dying?

505
00:36:08,443 --> 00:36:10,344
I'm just curious.

506
00:36:10,813 --> 00:36:14,483
First, I want to buy a five-tier cake and eat it whole.

507
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:18,054
- What else? - I guess I'd go travelling.

508
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:20,154
What else?

509
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,154
What else?

510
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:25,193
I don't know. I never thought about it.

511
00:36:28,193 --> 00:36:30,893
I thought about it just now, while our rice was being cooked.

512
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:36,974
I want to die after making you a success.

513
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:45,744
That's why I'll say this.

514
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:50,713
It'll be shocking, but don't be too shocked.

515
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:01,594
Quit publishing serially.

516
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:05,463
Not right away but within the month.

517
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:08,364
Consider it wrapping up your story short.

518
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:12,134
It's all his fault.

519
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:15,143
Lee Hyun Kyu, the darn water ghost.

520
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,844
Also, this isn't that big of a deal,

521
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:20,913
but it turned out that my boyfriend...

522
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:22,713
was a married man.

523
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:24,483
What?

524
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:26,684
He's insane!

525
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,184
You saw it for yourselves,

526
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:30,893
and you have brains to think with.

527
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:37,233
What do you think, Mr. Cha?

528
00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:39,193
I have no thoughts.

529
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:41,733
Okay. Go on having no thoughts.

530
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:42,904
Jung Min?

531
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:46,674
Whatever the situation may be,

532
00:37:46,674 --> 00:37:47,704
it's a fact it was an affair.

533
00:37:47,704 --> 00:37:48,804
Would she do that?

534
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:50,474
You can never truly know someone.

535
00:37:50,474 --> 00:37:52,643
The guy looked pretty loaded.

536
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:54,884
Would you like anyone with money?

537
00:37:54,884 --> 00:37:56,983
Why don't you seduce our CEO, then?

538
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,253
What does that mean?

539
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:01,483
You seemed to envy her for dating a rich guy.

540
00:38:01,684 --> 00:38:03,693
You're gutsy for saying that to his face.

541
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:05,893
I suddenly feel sick.

542
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:07,793
I think we reached an agreement. Let's go.

543
00:38:07,793 --> 00:38:10,233
We can't leave work on time, so let's try to do less overtime.

544
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:12,333
- I'm not yet... - You haven't agreed?

545
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,904
I have.

546
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:18,204
Guess what?

547
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:21,304
The café owner's dad owns this building.

548
00:38:21,304 --> 00:38:22,304
- No way. - No way.

549
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:24,413
Welcome. Just a moment.

550
00:38:24,413 --> 00:38:26,143
- He must live in the penthouse. - Come by again.

551
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:28,184
I heard the landlord's son stays here to maintain the building.

552
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,454
Then the yellow sports car in the basement parking...

553
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:32,313
must be his as well.

554
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:33,554
I heard it belongs to the landlord's son.

555
00:38:33,554 --> 00:38:34,554
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

556
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:38,893
- Bye. - Take care.

557
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:43,134
Welcome back.

558
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:48,804
- I thought you quit. - You said no.

559
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:50,833
Why won't you go home, then?

560
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,404
I have some editing to do.

561
00:38:52,404 --> 00:38:54,373
Why work hard if you're going to quit?

562
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:57,413
Will you do this for me, then?

563
00:38:58,043 --> 00:38:59,174
Work hard.

564
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,614
What did Ms. Lee Hyun say?

565
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,614
She said yes.

566
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:07,023
She knows better than anyone her work isn't that popular.

567
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:09,253
What did you and Jijo talk about?

568
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:10,994
It's Jijo King, not just Jijo.

569
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:13,264
I can't bear saying his full name.

570
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:14,793
I criticized him a bit.

571
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:17,793
What's the occasion? You never criticize anyone.

572
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:19,134
Good for you.

573
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:21,934
He wants a different editor. Someone pretty.

574
00:39:22,003 --> 00:39:25,103
Does he think we edit with our looks? That's just stupid.

575
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:26,704
Pretty Jung Min can handle him.

576
00:39:27,273 --> 00:39:29,204
- Am I pretty? - Yuck.

577
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:31,674
Sorry. I have a weak stomach.

578
00:39:32,114 --> 00:39:34,684
I said I'd edit his work. I'm the prettiest here.

579
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,284
Why did you date someone like that?

580
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:43,293
I was working at a café...

581
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:46,324
and someone passing by almost spilled coffee on my laptop.

582
00:39:46,324 --> 00:39:49,393
I'd almost finished editing about 80 episodes worth of a novel.

583
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:54,034
He suddenly showed up and shielded me with his body.

584
00:39:54,204 --> 00:39:55,833
- He scored. - He scored.

585
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,074
He scored.

586
00:39:57,074 --> 00:40:00,603
I said I'd pay for the dry-cleaning and he asked me out for coffee.

587
00:40:01,304 --> 00:40:03,674
And you saw the rest.

588
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,413
I did. It must've been tough.

589
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:03,034
I can only fill this many pages.

590
00:41:06,404 --> 00:41:08,603
In movies or dramas,

591
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:10,873
people who are about to die...

592
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:13,583
leave everything behind just fine.

593
00:41:14,884 --> 00:41:16,443
And think of a wish,

594
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:18,054
Tak Dong Kyung.

595
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:23,954
I have no money to spend, dreams to achieve,

596
00:41:24,393 --> 00:41:26,563
or love to work on.

597
00:41:28,063 --> 00:41:31,463
If I had 10 years to live, I'd want money, dreams,

598
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:33,333
or even love,

599
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:37,233
but I only have 100 days left.

600
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:39,304
Then someone else will die instead of you.

601
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:42,003
The person you love the most at that moment.

602
00:41:43,174 --> 00:41:45,143
The life I'll live after that...

603
00:41:45,474 --> 00:41:48,884
is nothing short of doom.

604
00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:51,954
You wanted this world to end.

605
00:41:57,324 --> 00:41:58,824
I'm exhausted.

606
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:03,634
Does everyone live like this?

607
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:07,733
Being harassed by both...

608
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,563
life and death?

609
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:17,443
As if they're neither alive nor dead?

610
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:21,143
(5th Ward)

611
00:42:31,594 --> 00:42:34,123
- Ms. Kim, the defibrillator. - Okay.

612
00:42:49,873 --> 00:42:51,643
Are you all right?

613
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:16,534
I don't think I'll see my 20th birthday in this lifetime.

614
00:43:18,134 --> 00:43:22,074
What kind of deity is always sick to death or dead sad?

615
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:25,614
Someone has to pay the price for this world to exist.

616
00:43:25,674 --> 00:43:27,643
Is the price tag this time a heart disease?

617
00:43:31,684 --> 00:43:34,583
I think it's because people here call for the deity the most.

618
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:38,924
True. They called you to be born.

619
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,264
I opened my eyes the moment a lot of people called out for me.

620
00:43:42,994 --> 00:43:45,494
So I will willingly pay the price.

621
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:50,174
That is the job of a deity the people called upon and...

622
00:43:50,904 --> 00:43:53,103
your job as the creation of a deity.

623
00:43:56,373 --> 00:43:57,974
You already know that...

624
00:43:58,174 --> 00:44:00,284
you cannot avoid your fate.

625
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:06,784
She will not give up on the world.

626
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:08,154
Not like you did.

627
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:12,793
I will make her give up on it.

628
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:13,994
Will you?

629
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:17,463
Even if you do, will it be possible?

630
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:20,103
Humans created the deity. Of course they can bring doom to this world.

631
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:22,003
You and I both are humans' will.

632
00:44:22,003 --> 00:44:24,204
Then I must do whatever it takes.

633
00:44:24,773 --> 00:44:27,174
Because that's not all the humans want.

634
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:31,373
You should go before midnight.

635
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:39,784
The deity is never ignorant.

636
00:44:39,884 --> 00:44:42,284
We just pretend to be.

637
00:44:59,404 --> 00:45:01,074
Are you ready?

638
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,773
One, two.

639
00:45:04,344 --> 00:45:06,014
I'll take one more.

640
00:45:08,344 --> 00:45:11,083
No. Smile brightly.

641
00:45:12,054 --> 00:45:13,253
Do you have a death wish?

642
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,253
- Pardon? - Why are you here?

643
00:45:16,454 --> 00:45:18,494
Do you want another slap?

644
00:45:20,063 --> 00:45:22,893
Is that how you usually apologize?

645
00:45:23,634 --> 00:45:25,063
I don't feel sorry.

646
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,804
You can fight after I take your photo.

647
00:45:28,404 --> 00:45:29,904
Smile.

648
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:32,733
Smile. He wants you to.

649
00:45:41,943 --> 00:45:45,454
Can you shave a little more off my chin?

650
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,483
Then it won't be your face.

651
00:45:47,983 --> 00:45:50,693
- Does that matter? - It does.

652
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:53,193
ID photos are used to identify you.

653
00:45:54,123 --> 00:45:56,324
This isn't for an ID.

654
00:45:58,134 --> 00:45:59,994
Print it out in that size.

655
00:45:59,994 --> 00:46:01,434
And frame it too.

656
00:46:01,864 --> 00:46:03,603
It's usually black, right?

657
00:46:04,904 --> 00:46:08,304
Shall I make your eyes bigger too?

658
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:10,174
- Yes. - Then...

659
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:29,364
Do you have to do this? A car would be more comfortable.

660
00:46:29,364 --> 00:46:31,034
I won't ride your car.

661
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:32,693
Who knows what'll happen?

662
00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:35,103
Then take a bus.

663
00:46:35,404 --> 00:46:38,704
Don't talk to me. I feel like walking in silence.

664
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:41,443
You waste your time.

665
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:43,614
Shouldn't you be trying to spend every second well?

666
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:51,284
You only look at me when I pick a fight.

667
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,824
Humans are really weird.

668
00:46:57,824 --> 00:46:59,494
Why make things like that?

669
00:46:59,494 --> 00:47:01,023
You never get to see them yourself.

670
00:47:01,424 --> 00:47:03,693
It's for others, not me.

671
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,563
I'm like that sometimes.

672
00:47:08,904 --> 00:47:10,574
Then you decided to die.

673
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:14,244
Do things like you only care about yourselves?

674
00:47:18,273 --> 00:47:21,384
You have no idea how much I put others first.

675
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:23,043
Look at me now.

676
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:25,284
You slapped me, but I'm here to save you.

677
00:47:34,793 --> 00:47:35,963
Time's ticking.

678
00:47:52,574 --> 00:47:54,684
Get used to it, if you want to walk with me.

679
00:47:56,813 --> 00:47:58,353
Did you do that?

680
00:48:01,654 --> 00:48:03,184
I didn't do it,

681
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,253
but it is because of me.

682
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:19,474
(911 Ambulance)

683
00:48:19,974 --> 00:48:21,404
Was that you too?

684
00:48:21,804 --> 00:48:22,844
Sometimes.

685
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,983
(18 traffic accidents yesterday in Seoul, 2 dead, 8 injured)

686
00:48:28,143 --> 00:48:29,284
Yes.

687
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,224
How do you live like that?

688
00:48:36,523 --> 00:48:38,853
I don't live. I just exist.

689
00:48:41,963 --> 00:48:44,034
I'm just a button of doom.

690
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:48,264
Every step I take, every move my hand makes,

691
00:48:49,603 --> 00:48:50,974
every breath I take.

692
00:48:52,574 --> 00:48:54,773
Everything about me leads to doom.

693
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:57,114
I exist for that.

694
00:49:01,184 --> 00:49:03,083
And if you don't do anything?

695
00:49:04,684 --> 00:49:06,554
What if you don't do anything?

696
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:11,393
All hell breaks out on earth.

697
00:49:12,293 --> 00:49:15,523
Unusual temperatures persist and the cause is yet unknown.

698
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:17,864
It's October, and all over the country,

699
00:49:17,864 --> 00:49:19,134
heat waves and drought...

700
00:49:19,134 --> 00:49:21,103
This year's harvest is a disaster.

701
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:23,034
- There's no point. - I hate the world.

702
00:49:23,034 --> 00:49:25,333
- It's crazy. - It's insane.

703
00:49:25,603 --> 00:49:28,373
- How can he kill his kid? - Why won't Mom just die?

704
00:49:28,373 --> 00:49:31,514
- You darn scumbag. - Why won't a deity kill him first?

705
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:39,954
"If you gain something, you lose something."

706
00:49:40,384 --> 00:49:44,753
"Everything you've gained in life were thanks to things you lost."

707
00:49:46,123 --> 00:49:48,393
I get what that means now.

708
00:49:49,793 --> 00:49:52,163
You need winter to have spring,

709
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:55,333
and darkness to have light.

710
00:49:56,634 --> 00:50:00,744
Death must exist for life. It's like that, isn't it?

711
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:06,074
So you are winter, darkness,

712
00:50:06,744 --> 00:50:07,943
and death.

713
00:50:11,184 --> 00:50:12,253
Yes.

714
00:50:12,313 --> 00:50:15,554
Like you said, you really do care for nothing but others.

715
00:50:17,123 --> 00:50:19,994
You just had to come to me when you cared only about yourself.

716
00:50:26,034 --> 00:50:28,103
How long must we hold hands for?

717
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:35,143
I thought you held on because you liked it.

718
00:50:57,864 --> 00:51:00,634
Why follow me all the way here? It's too much pressure.

719
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:02,603
But thanks anyway.

720
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:06,404
You can go now. I won't run away again.

721
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:07,873
Shall we meet again tomorrow?

722
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:10,773
- What? - Shall I come for you?

723
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:13,983
It's up to you.

724
00:51:15,443 --> 00:51:17,483
Why are you like this so suddenly?

725
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:20,253
Why do I care whether you crawl in pain or not?

726
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:23,893
Do you have a mood disorder or something?

727
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:25,393
Why do you suddenly change tune?

728
00:51:25,954 --> 00:51:28,623
Hey, things were nice between us just now.

729
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:31,994
We were beginning to understand and figure out each other.

730
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:34,364
I'm saying you should be more clingy.

731
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:36,463
To you?

732
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,134
To your fate that came to you.

733
00:51:50,614 --> 00:51:52,184
Hey, Tak Dong Kyung.

734
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:58,954
Tak Dong Kyung.

735
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:00,864
What do you want?

736
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:03,293
I don't see straight right now.

737
00:52:09,663 --> 00:52:12,134
I was out of my mind, Dong Kyung.

738
00:52:13,474 --> 00:52:16,204
I didn't mean what I said.

739
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:19,313
It shouldn't be past tense. You still are out of your mind.

740
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:21,284
You have completely lost it!

741
00:52:21,284 --> 00:52:24,514
We loved each other. We were in love!

742
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:27,523
What I said at your work wasn't true. That was nonsense.

743
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:29,983
This is how I truly feel. I'm drunk but honest.

744
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:31,353
Yes, "Drunk Honesty".

745
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:32,954
I sang that song for you many times.

746
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,163
Don't you remember?

747
00:52:34,893 --> 00:52:37,934
Let go of me. I said let go!

748
00:52:38,494 --> 00:52:41,364
If you're drunk, go home! Why did you come here?

749
00:52:41,364 --> 00:52:47,404
Yes, I might be drunk

750
00:52:47,674 --> 00:52:51,614
This might be a mistake

751
00:52:52,143 --> 00:52:55,213
Every morning

752
00:52:56,713 --> 00:52:59,483
Now I will confess

753
00:52:59,483 --> 00:53:02,784
I loved you from the start

754
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:05,293
Let go of me.

755
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:06,793
Let go of me already.

756
00:53:06,924 --> 00:53:09,994
Get out of my life!

757
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:13,534
My awkward ramblings

758
00:53:13,534 --> 00:53:14,663
Darn you.

759
00:53:14,663 --> 00:53:17,404
- I may be crude - Let go!

760
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:20,204
- I may not sound trustworthy - Oh, gosh. Let go!

761
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,143
Who are you?

762
00:53:23,503 --> 00:53:26,773
Let go. Let go of me!

763
00:53:27,713 --> 00:53:28,884
Was that a wish?

764
00:53:29,284 --> 00:53:31,684
- What? - "Get out of my life."

765
00:53:32,184 --> 00:53:34,623
Are you crazy? Why would I waste my wish on him?

766
00:53:34,824 --> 00:53:36,884
Will you let go of me?

767
00:53:37,023 --> 00:53:39,054
Then shall I get rid of him like this?

768
00:53:42,424 --> 00:53:43,494
Honey.

769
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,003
"Honey"?

770
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:49,264
Your husband.

771
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:51,474
"Honey"? Tak Dong Kyung, who is this jerk?

772
00:53:51,474 --> 00:53:54,804
This must be the sicko you were talking about.

773
00:53:55,674 --> 00:53:58,043
Leave him to me. Go inside and have dinner.

774
00:53:58,543 --> 00:54:00,543
I made cold cucumber soup, your favourite, sweetie.

775
00:54:01,313 --> 00:54:02,543
"Sweetie"?

776
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:05,253
Cold cucumber soup?

777
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:07,724
Tak Dong Kyung.

778
00:54:08,154 --> 00:54:10,893
Were you seeing someone? Were you living with someone?

779
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:13,853
This actually works much better.

780
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:17,264
I lied about being married and you that you live with a guy.

781
00:54:17,264 --> 00:54:19,793
That makes us even. We can start over, can't we?

782
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:21,063
What are you lot doing?

783
00:54:27,503 --> 00:54:28,574
What's going on?

784
00:54:28,704 --> 00:54:29,773
Hey.

785
00:54:31,074 --> 00:54:32,974
It's not what you think. Don't.

786
00:54:32,974 --> 00:54:35,213
Who is married and who's she living with?

787
00:54:35,913 --> 00:54:37,684
I'll whack the married one first.

788
00:54:38,554 --> 00:54:41,384
- No, wait, why... - Hey.

789
00:54:41,384 --> 00:54:43,353
- Hey. - What are you doing?

790
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:45,623
- Come here! - Darn it.

791
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:20,963
Shoot.

792
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:29,333
It's hilarious.

793
00:55:32,634 --> 00:55:34,043
Just dumbfounding.

794
00:55:38,143 --> 00:55:40,413
Leave it. I'll clean it up.

795
00:55:40,514 --> 00:55:41,583
Thanks for help...

796
00:55:55,364 --> 00:55:57,123
I said I'd make it so you don't hurt.

797
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:04,904
I see why you thought of me.

798
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:10,373
I wondered what kind of person would make that wish at that time.

799
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:14,483
I wasn't thinking of you.

800
00:56:15,014 --> 00:56:16,643
I am doom myself.

801
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:20,983
You were the only person who had the same thought at the same time.

802
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:28,094
I'm grateful.

803
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:30,424
In many ways.

804
00:56:49,643 --> 00:56:50,713
Hey.

805
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:59,253
This won't do.

806
00:57:02,824 --> 00:57:04,134
Let's live together.

807
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,494
You and me.

808
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:18,034
(Doom at Your Service)

809
00:58:18,304 --> 00:58:20,574
Why did I ask him to live with me?

810
00:58:20,574 --> 00:58:21,704
Embarrassment lasts but just a second.

811
00:58:21,904 --> 00:58:23,804
- Hi, brother-in-law. - Hey.

812
00:58:24,773 --> 00:58:27,174
What are all these bottles? And this sofa?

813
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:28,483
Where do I sleep?

814
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:30,083
Was that him?

815
00:58:30,684 --> 00:58:32,313
The one you love the most.

816
00:58:33,184 --> 00:58:36,154
Can't you change his fate?

817
00:58:36,724 --> 00:58:37,793
Give me your hand.

818
00:58:38,253 --> 00:58:39,424
I'm not human.

819
00:58:39,623 --> 00:58:40,824
I feel no pity or love.

820
00:58:40,824 --> 00:58:42,494
I don't have that kind of feeling.

821
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:45,094
I do, because I'm human.

822
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:48,404
So become the first human to love me.
