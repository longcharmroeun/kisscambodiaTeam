You have multifocal glioblastomas.

They are the cause of your dizziness...

on the weekend?

13

No, I don't.

How many days will it take to do the biopsy?

15

18
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,094
Then, I can't.

19

You can't do a biopsy?

20
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,164
No.

21
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:33,140
I already used some of my vacation days.

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,034
So I can't take a week off from work.

Shouldn't you put your health before your work?

24

I'm not sure.

25

and a cognitive disorder as well.

32

Getting a biopsy can be risky enough.

33
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,175
- It's risky? - Yes.

34
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,145
Will I die?

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,675

Don't worry. When the time is right, you'll get it back.

Some wilt away quickly.

163
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,044
Some turn out to be medicinal, and some, poisonous.

164
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,875
And some plants will kill everything around them.

165
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,184
Is that my fault?

166
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,615
Pull them out. Plant only the good ones.

00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,054
A garden doesn't belong to a gardener.

169
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,794
Then what about me?

170
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,595
What is my position in your garden?

171
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,865
You are a butterfly.

172
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,740
For the flowers in my garden.

173
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,205
Until when?

174
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,075
Forever.

175
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,044
You are way too cruel. Especially to a birthday boy.

176
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,615
Birthday? You think you're human?

177
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:16,455
Have you ever been born? Or human for that matter?

178
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,325
Go.

179
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,195
Go and become someone's wish.

180
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,634
Today is the only day that's possible.

181
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,875
Even my birthday isn't for me.

182
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:37,835
For humans.

183
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,245
Darn those flowers.

184
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,144
It's about time they wilt away.

185
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:58,125
A bus will arrive shortly.

187
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,644
(Boyfriend)

188
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:57,184
- Hey, sweetie. - Are you busy?

189
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,024
No. I'm...

190
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,225
I'm outside. I was meeting up with a writer.

191
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,400
Really? Then can we meet now?

192
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,595
Now?

193
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,825
I need to see you right now.

194
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:09,870
What's wrong?

195
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,569
Let's talk in person.

196
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:13,465
Come to that cafe. Okay?

197
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,304
Hey...

198
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,174
Gosh.

199
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,774
- She splashed water on that girl. - No way.

200
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,945
As you can see, this is all I can do because I'm pregnant.

201
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:34,884
Can you explain...

202
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:36,900
this?

203
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,465
You're the one who needs to explain things to me.

204
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,030
You're the mistress.

205
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,569
You expect me, his wife, to explain what happened?

206
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,235
Where did you learn your manners?

207
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,105
I see. That's what happened.

208
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,375
Fine.

209
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,075
That explains everything.

210
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,049
I heard that you met here for the first time.

211
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,720
Did you look through his phone?

212
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
You don't think I didn't?

213
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,959
Then you must have seen how he never called me on weekends...

214
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:08,424
and answered my calls at night.

215
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,860
Whenever I couldn't reach him, he told me his phone died,

216
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,929
it was on silent mode, and he was working.

217
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:14,664
You must've read those texts then.

218
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,294
That always bothered me.

219
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:20,804
I knew something was off, but...

220
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,079
Now, this explains everything.

221
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:25,679
Are you telling me you didn't know he was married?

222
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,809
Yes. I didn't.

223
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,815
You didn't know after dating him for three months?

224
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,449
Stop lying to me!

225
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:34,189
You didn't know your husband was cheating on you for three months.

226
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,384
Hey!

227
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,784
So you're saying you didn't do anything wrong?

228
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,495
Is that it?

229
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:44,659
I guess so.

230
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,970
"I guess so"? You're unbelievable.

231
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,735
Then whom should I splash water on?

232
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,815
You can at least take it out on me.

233
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,615
But I can't even take it out on you.

234
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,620
It's all that jerk's fault. What should I do?

235
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,955
Why are you telling me your sob story?

236
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,485
Right.

237
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,884
I shouldn't say that to you.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,264
So...

239
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,065
you can keep blaming me.

240
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:28,610
What?

241
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,105
Pretend that your gentle, innocent husband...

242
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,904
was deceived by an awful woman and almost ruined his life.

243
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,475
Be it 10 or 50 years.

244
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,115
Live happily with that cheater for a long time.

245
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,154
That will be better for your child too.

246
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,365
- Are you okay? - Gosh.

247
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,664
- Oh, no. - I'm not okay.

248
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,404
- Should you go to a hospital? - Are you okay?

249
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,105
Taxi! Right here!

250
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:06,679
Right here. Yes.

251
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,544
Wait. Be careful.

252
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,715
Be careful.

253
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,355
Sir, drive us to a nearby hospital with OBGYNs.

254
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,535
The mother is okay.

255
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,305
This happens frequently when mothers are stressed.

256
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,849
- You don't have to worry. - Okay.

257
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,105
Are you her guardian?

258
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:42,444
No.

259
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,884
She's just a mutual friend. Something like that.

260
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,255
Do you know her guardian's number?

261
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:54,224
Yes.

263
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:04,535
Then can you fill this out for me?

269

We still need to talk.

270
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,845
Let's talk once you feel better.

271
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,845
I knew something was off too.

272
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,884
His excuses didn't make sense.

273
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,460
But I wanted to blame it on you...

274
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,325
because I thought if I did that, it might be your fault.

275
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,295
What I told you earlier...

276
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,934
I meant it when I told you to blame it on me.

277
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,704
Blame me for it because...

278
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,515
I'll die in three months.

279
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,585
I was wondering who's going to hear this news first.

280
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,629
I didn't know that I would be telling you that in this context.

281
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:40,224
Well, I didn't know that I was terminally ill.

282
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,500
Are you serious?

283
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,539
I meant everything I said at the cafe and here.

284
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:47,664
So...

285
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,734
you don't have to worry.

286
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:53,944
And...

287
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:58,644
I sincerely hope you two will have a long and happy life.

288

I'm really dying.

Hey, do you think work is a joke?

290
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,379
You left to meet with the writer hours ago.

291
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:03,879
Why did you come back so late?

292
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:06,744
You should have just gone home then. Why come back here?

293
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,255
- I'm sorry. - That's it?

Are you acting out?

297
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,994
You should just quit. Why don't you quit your job?

298
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:23,139
You must think earning money is easy.

299
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,765
Kids these days don't have any work ethics.

300
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,835
I wasn't feeling well.

301
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,474
The writer told me to get a scan since I was already at the hospital.

302
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,010
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,849
This is why I can't hire women.

304
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,414
They always complain that they aren't feeling well.

305
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,920
They are like broken machines.

306
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,190
At least, I can get those machines fixed.

307
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,184
Gosh. I can't even get her fixed.

308
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,430
I don't feel well, either.

309
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,694
You know,

310
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,770
I have rhinitis and a herniated disk.

311
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,065
I feel like I'm dying too.

312

As you can see, this is all I can do...

315
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,250
- because I'm pregnant. - What?

316
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,615
- Hey, isn't that you? - Can you explain...

317
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,015
- What? - this?

318
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:18,160
You're the one who needs to explain things to me.

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,684
What are you going to do then?

335
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,924
Did you...

336
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,724
just yell at me?

337
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,069
You think I'm a joke, right?

338
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:03,099
What?

339
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,805
Of course. Even I think I'm a joke.

340
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,305
Why is everyone torturing me today?

341
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,244
I'll take a day off today.

342
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,444
I will.

343
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,180
I already don't have a lot of vacation days left,

344
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,684
so I'll use one today.

What...

347
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,755
That's her in the video.

348
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,565
She said no, so it must not be her.

349
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:34,694
You think so? That's not her?

350

- Hey. - I told them earlier...

411

that we should get expensive insurance.

Not knowing how to cry...

00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,805
has been a habit of mine for a long time.

435

When I was 10,

436
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:20,325
I learned how to swallow my tears.

437

438

ended up going.

Now I finally get it.

440
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,220
They're our family, so someone in the family should raise them.

It's not like you're going to volunteer.

442
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,389
It's not easy to raise someone else's children.

They shouldn't grow up walking on eggshells.

Why don't we just send them to an orphanage...

They'll hear you.

447
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:52,180
I wasn't able to cry ever since that day.

448
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,184
And all those tears must've...

449
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,884
turned into a lump and took place somewhere in my brain.

453
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,418
Yes. People will think I'm crazy.

462
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,235
Gosh, I should teach that punk a lesson.

I just want the world to come to an end!

499
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,850
I want to be happy with my family.

500
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,784
I want everything destroyed!

501
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:31,054
Just bring doom to this world!

502
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:42,164
I smell alcohol in this wish.

503
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:52,635
(Small Village Makgeolli)

504
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,994
Gosh, who's here at this hour?

505
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:18,264
(3:33am, November 24, Tuesday)

506
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,545
My gosh.

507
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,085
Gosh, how annoying.

508
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:38,155
Seriously.

509
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,894
Hello.

510
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,835
I pranked you so you'd quickly open the door.

511
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,569
- What? - I'm talking about how you saw...

512
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:30,235
Switzerland and Italy through the peephole.

513
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:41,385
Why is he...

514
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,054
Yes, I know I'm handsome.

515
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:48,089
My gosh. What are you doing here?

516
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:49,490
You called me here.

517
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,655
What?

518
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,629
I did?

519
00:40:52,629 --> 00:40:54,764
Yes, you called me.

520
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,534
Who are you?

521
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,635
Myul Mang.

522
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,310
You took ages to come to the door, so I thought your house was big.

523
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,319
But it's tiny.

524
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,644
Hey! What...

525
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,514
Don't just stand there. Sit down.

526
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:21,085
This is my house.

527
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,985
I know. Don't worry about it.

528
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,224
The anniversary of someone's death?

529
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,695
Today's my birthday.

530
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:37,704
Oh, really? I see.

531
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,445
Happy birthday.

532
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,974
No one's congratulated me on my birthday before.

533
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,560
Don't bother wasting your energy. It won't take long.

534
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,290
You just need to tell me your wish out loud.

535
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,454
What?

536
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:00,525
- What wish? - You wanted this world to end.

537
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:05,565
Just bring doom to this world!

538
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,209
You were listening to me?

539
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:10,304
You knew where I lived? Were you roaming around my house?

540
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,105
No, I didn't. I'm busy.

541
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,655
Who are you?

542
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,795
What do you want?

543
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,335
Is it cake?

544
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,605
We don't have time. You're going to die soon.

545
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,284
Exactly 100 days later.

546
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:12,264
What... By any chance,

547
00:43:12,939 --> 00:43:15,164
are you from the hospital?

548
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:17,740
Do you think a doctor can do that?

549
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,644
No, I'm sure they can't.

550
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,175
My birthday doesn't come easily.

551
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:26,545
It travels worldwide and through the fates of many people.

552
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,114
So hurry up and make a wish before it's too late.

553
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,824
I didn't know glioblastoma would bring this kind of symptom.

554
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,894
- What? - I'm hallucinating.

555
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:42,494
This is so cool.

556
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:47,335
I guess you need more time.

557
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:50,810
This situation is very unrealistic, so I understand.

558
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:51,974
What?

559
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:56,375
It's okay. My birthday isn't over yet.

560
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,485
See you later.

561
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,905
Is this a dream?

562
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,545
Of course not.

563
00:44:52,299 --> 00:44:55,704
No, wait. My gosh.

564
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,505
I don't get it. I really don't.

565
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:26,664
It's taking longer than expected.

566
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:44,454
What's going on? Where am I?

567
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,994
My house.

568
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:54,724
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

569
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:56,094
It's his house?

570
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,499
Did I get kidnapped?

571
00:45:58,499 --> 00:46:01,465
I guess you could say that. But to be more exact,

572
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:04,005
I came into your dream without permission.

573
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,405
My dream?

574
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,054
So you're saying this is a dream?

575
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,594
Seriously?

576
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:33,439
- Is this real? - I know you're dreaming,

577
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:35,664
but have some manners. This is my house.

578
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,835
Look who's talking. You also...

579
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:42,105
By the way, why do you keep talking to me without honorifics?

580
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,114
You talked to me like that first.

581
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:47,120
- I did? - "Just bring doom to this world."

582
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,720
You said it without honorifics, so I thought that's what you wanted.

583
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,514
I wasn't talking to you when I said that.

584
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:55,054
Then whom were you talking to?

585
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,454
I'm doom itself.

586
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,465
So you're telling me this is a dream?

587
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:15,945
What?

588
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:19,844
Where's the front door?

589
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,414
I'm going to go home.

590
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:36,094
I guess you don't like the location.

591
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,704
It's where you wanted to go.

592
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,815
It's for the cake.

593
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,614
So are you saying...

594
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:01,385
you're doom?

595
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:04,655
I'm responsible for everything that dies or gets destroyed.

596
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:08,330
Then why not end the world yourself? Why do you keep asking me for help?

597
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:09,764
Do you think I haven't tried?

598
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,094
It didn't work.

599
00:48:12,299 --> 00:48:14,109
It's probably because I'm just a small part of a system.

600
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:15,669
What? I don't get what you mean.

601
00:48:15,669 --> 00:48:19,034
In other words, you guys have more authority than I do.

602
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,974
It's how mother nature works.

603
00:48:22,379 --> 00:48:24,875
But this time, I'm hoping it might be different...

604
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:26,844
because it's what a human being wants.

605
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:29,890
But why does that have to be me?

606
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,959
No one's ever looked up to a shooting star...

607
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:33,315
and made a wish like you.

608
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:40,470
Then do you disappear if you don't grant a wish?

609
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,425
That's what happens in fantasy novels.

610
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,235
Of course not.

611
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:47,864
It's just a small event.

612
00:48:47,939 --> 00:48:51,974
I was told to become someone's wish on the day I was born.

613
00:48:57,049 --> 00:48:59,344
Is this a nightmare?

614
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:03,144
Your life is a nightmare.

615
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,054
What?

616
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,554
Unfortunately, it's time for you to wake up.

617
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:14,894
What?

618
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,715
It was a dream.

619
00:49:35,649 --> 00:49:36,914
It was a dream.

620
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:58,434
It was a dream. I swear it was.

621
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:06,045
Look at all this dirt.

622
00:50:06,649 --> 00:50:09,419
My gosh, that crazy punk!

623
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:12,184
Is he American or what?

624
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,554
My gosh.

625
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:41,414
I'll help you feel no pain.

626
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,889
You won't feel any kind of pain as you die.

627
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,985
What do you say?

628
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,334
I'd like a roll of gimbap.

629
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,735
Fine.

630
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,814
I'll grant you another wish.

631
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,949
Not something you wished for when you were drunk...

632
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:16,885
but something you truly want.

633
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,454
But this is as far as I can go.

634
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:27,794
(Original Gimbap)

635
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,704
Let's not listen to the lunatic.

636
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:36,934
Don't listen to him.

637
00:51:43,879 --> 00:51:47,350
My gosh, does everyone in the city go to work using the subway?

638
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,314
Why can't they all just disappear?

639
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,445
See? You also want it.

640
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,055
You...

641
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,474
I'm sick. I'm definitely sick.

642
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:55,144
Ms. Tak.

643
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:01,390
Thanks to the cafe owner downstairs,

644
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,994
I postponed my resignation to tomorrow again.

645
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,799
Ms. Jo, about yesterday...

646
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:09,695
Mr. Park isn't coming to work today.

647
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:12,164
He probably went to kneel before his girlfriend again.

648
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:14,569
- What? - He was too hysterical yesterday.

649
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:16,770
So we assumed he fought with his girlfriend again.

650
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,934
Da In heard them fight on the rooftop.

651
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,275
Apparently, it was a huge mess.

652
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,215
He really needs to stop bringing in his private life to work.

653
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:27,785
Thank you for this.

654
00:53:29,549 --> 00:53:32,020
Sure. Enjoy your coffee.

655
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:35,485
Just don't get furious and end up quitting your job.

656
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:38,454
If you quit, we'll have to suffer. You know that, right?

657
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,169
Why aren't you answering me?

658
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:43,325
Hey.

659
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:46,934
Ms. Tak.

660
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,770
The writer for "Siberia" is in the meeting room.

661
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:51,035
Already?

662
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,879
It's not time for the meeting yet.

663
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:58,215
Writers can be really self-centered.

664
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:11,255
Where's the writer?

665
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:13,055
He's inside.

666
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,394
There he is.

667
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:29,749
Are you a stalker or an American? Just choose one already.

668
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,250
I also sold gimbap and was also a doctor.

669
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,089
What did you do to them? It's like they're bewitched.

670
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:36,615
I really did bewitch them.

671
00:54:39,919 --> 00:54:43,684
This is driving me crazy. Have I really lost it?

672
00:54:46,399 --> 00:54:47,825
No, you haven't lost it.

673
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,264
The writer is wandering around somewhere. I needed time with you.

674
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:53,899
How do you know?

675
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:55,140
I know because I sent him somewhere.

676
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,474
No, not that. How can you read my mind?

677
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:01,104
I guess you're a little dull.

678
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,845
By any chance, are you...

679
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,814
I have a question for you.

680
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,615
Why do you work here if you hate the CEO and the firm?

681
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,684
Should I get rid of your CEO for you?

682
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,425
I can make it happen if that's your wish.

683
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:17,285
Stop reading my mind.

684
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:20,029
To be more exact, I hear things. I don't read them.

685
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:21,394
Stop listening.

686
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:24,040
Then accept my offer.

687
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,465
I'm unable to read or hear the minds of those who make a promise with me.

688
00:55:30,169 --> 00:55:31,305
Get out.

689
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,615
I'll just leave instead.

690
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,655
I'm going to go and meet Ms. Lee Hyun.

691
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:50,454
Thank you for the coffee.

692
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,299
Ji Na.

693
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:01,540
Hey, I just woke up.

694
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,040
Why are you calling? Aren't you going to come anyway?

695
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,434
Something's driving me nuts.

696
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:08,104
What happened? Did your CEO bother you again?

697
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:11,319
A doctor... No, this American...

698
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:14,115
No, this crazy guy... I mean, this guy who sells gimbap...

699
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:19,014
- Gosh, where do I begin? - What?

700
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,494
("Welcoming the Destruction of Lowell")

701
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,354
Never mind. I'll tell you when we meet.

702
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:11,104
Nothing changed even after I was told that I'll be dying.

703
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:16,374
You're not scared of things you can't see...

704
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:20,075
such as death or destruction.

705
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:22,615
But once they become visible,

706
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:26,615
your fear suddenly becomes real.

707
00:57:46,609 --> 00:57:47,945
Pain...

708
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,104
is real.

709
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,184
Oh, dear.

710
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:15,305
Tell me. Who's having fun playing around with my life?

711
00:58:16,109 --> 00:58:17,264
Hey!

712
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,275
The deity is on my side.

713
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,084
Choose. Will you die here and now?

714
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,655
Or will you take my hand?

715
01:00:24,129 --> 01:00:25,434
And the answer is...

716
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,905
Me.

717
01:01:00,469 --> 01:01:05,334
And just like that, I held Myul Mang's hand.

718
01:01:43,779 --> 01:01:46,445
(Doom at Your Service)

719
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,845
You said to become a human's wish.

720
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:52,485
But that human's wish happens to be doom.

721
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:57,624
Why me? Why? Why must it be me?

722
01:01:57,799 --> 01:01:58,994
Fate.

723
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Smile.

724
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,794
Why are you so nice to me all of a sudden?

725
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,100
Get off me!

726
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,468
I'll take care of it. You should go inside and eat.

727
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:08,735
Shall we meet again tomorrow? Should I go pick you up?

728
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:09,739
What's with you?

729
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:11,775
You should be a bit more clingy.

730
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:13,275
What? To you?

731
01:02:13,509 --> 01:02:15,445
No, to your fate that came to you.
