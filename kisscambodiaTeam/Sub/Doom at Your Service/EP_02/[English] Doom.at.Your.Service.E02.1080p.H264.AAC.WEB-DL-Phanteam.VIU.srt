00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:12,207
(Doom at Your Service)

2
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:15,277
(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

3
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:17,847
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

4
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,547
The deity is on my side.

5
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:56,386
Choose. Will you die here and now?

6
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:00,026
Or will you take my hand?

7
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,267
And the answer is...

8
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,336
Me.

9
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,346
Don't let go.

10
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:37,227
Don't let go unless you want to die right now.

11
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:53,366
(Episode 2)

12
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,746
How is this possible?

13
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:59,007
All we did was go back in time.

14
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,177
- It's nothing that grand. - Not that.

15
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:05,586
Your...

16
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:08,216
How do I put it?

17
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:11,786
I'm searching for a term that won't sound rude.

18
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:13,556
- My identity? - Yes.

19
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,227
Are you suspicious or curious?

20
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:19,727
Neither. I'm simply being rational.

21
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,197
But you saw earlier.

22
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:22,936
You experienced it first hand. Accept it.

23
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:24,137
That's easier said than done.

24
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,306
- You're alive right now. - So?

25
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:29,107
It was Switzerland and then Italy outside your door.

26
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:30,906
So?

27
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:33,406
In your dream, on the subway, and at work.

28
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,577
Don't you remember?

29
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:37,647
I do remember. But it makes no sense.

30
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:40,257
I feel like I've gone insane.

31
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,627
Okay. Watch.

32
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,057
What?

33
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:52,426
- Oh my gosh. - Did the lights go out?

34
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,536
What's wrong with this?

35
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:58,137
What about this?

36
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:00,776
That's odd. What's going on?

37
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,947
A timely coincidence?

38
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,716
- What's going on? - My phone turned off.

39
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:12,017
- Why did it suddenly turn off? - It won't work.

40
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,586
Did the battery die?

41
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:18,257
A timely coincidence?

42
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:20,926
I see.

43
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:25,267
Are you an electric type?

44
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,807
- Look. - What's that in the sky?

45
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,577
Are they comets?

46
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,007
My gosh.

47
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:46,216
Comets out of the blue?

48
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:48,517
Okay. I get it, so stop.

49
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:51,156
Why? I didn't do that.

50
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,526
I'm an electric type.

51
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:56,127
I said to stop it.

52
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,226
Stop it.

53
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,707
What's going on?

54
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:10,276
The power's back.

55
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:13,676
I'm not very nice.

56
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:15,117
My phone turned back on too.

57
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:17,187
That's with whom you entered into a contract.

58
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:19,687
Remember that I'm evil.

59
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,776
I need to stop fooling around, and go.

60
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:43,807
- All of a sudden? - Something annoying happened.

61
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,476
Consider that a show to commemorate our contract.

62
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:48,916
I hope you enjoy yourself.

63
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,166
You didn't want to hold it before. Now, you don't want to let go?

64
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:09,067
You said not to let go.

65
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,286
- What's this? - My promise.

66
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,346
I said I'd make sure you don't feel pain.

67
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:34,356
Don't relax too much.

68
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:37,226
You have to recharge it once a day before midnight.

69
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,026
Recharge it? How?

70
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,096
- By holding my hand. - What? Why?

71
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:42,367
In case you run away.

72
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,707
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyung.

73
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:55,747
Hey. How do you know my name?

74
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:56,747
Hey!

75
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,666
Excuse me.

76
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,536
Yes?

77
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,106
Do you remember the crosswalk earlier?

78
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,377
- You don't remember? - No, I don't.

79
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:25,906
I guess it really didn't happen.

80
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,847
You're such high maintenance.

81
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:14,727
I'll kill you in due time.

82
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,837
I said not to park your car in my spot,

83
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:31,046
but you keep trying.

84
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:33,507
Doom is my domain.

85
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,217
Do something.

86
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:40,217
I keep hearing the voices.

87
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:44,926
I can't sleep. It's driving me crazy.

88
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,826
- Die. - You piece of trash.

89
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:49,796
- Stop. - Coward.

90
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:50,997
- Die. - He deserves to die.

91
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:52,267
Die, you murderer.

92
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,737
- Coward. - Die.

93
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:55,436
He should be ripped apart!

94
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,137
- Die! - Die.

95
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,166
How does it feel?

96
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:01,137
I deal with it every day.

97
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:04,007
Please kill me! I'm begging you!

98
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:08,477
Three of the people you stabbed died.

99
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,946
Two of them are still in a coma.

100
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:14,056
But you're alive and well. You should thank me.

101
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:16,816
That wasn't my plan.

102
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:19,656
It wasn't.

103
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:22,397
Life doesn't go as planned.

104
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:24,326
I'll stop here for today.

105
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,597
I got a good contract today, so I'm feeling chipper.

106
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,397
Who are you?

107
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,066
Have you ever heard this phrase?

108
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:36,406
"I am the first and the last, the beginning and the end."

109
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:43,676
I'm that. The last. The end.

110
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:52,257
Hey!

111
00:10:56,497 --> 00:11:00,127
Why are you doing this to me? What do you want?

112
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:02,237
Doom.

113
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,276
(Jo Scum)

114
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:12,576
Why is he calling me?

115
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:28,026
Hey. I know you won't believe what I'm about to tell you,

116
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:30,426
but hear me out without giving me lip...

117
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:31,426
Hello?

118
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,727
Ji Na!

119
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:35,897
Ji Na!

120
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:38,007
What's wrong?

121
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:39,936
What is it? What's wrong?

122
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:41,837
I'm going to die.

123
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,107
- What? - I'm going to die!

124
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:47,276
Why?

125
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,987
Wait. Don't tell me...

126
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:56,286
I lost it all.

127
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,127
It's divine will.

128
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,436
My writing was garbage, so the powers at be deleted it.

129
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,267
They should've done it before I finished it.

130
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:13,977
What was with those comets?

131
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:15,607
What was with the power outage?

132
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:20,176
What else?

133
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:21,546
It's a sign that I should die.

134
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,686
Take care. Goodbye.

135
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:33,357
Why should you die?

136
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:35,127
This is all that jerk's fault.

137
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:39,826
That jerk?

138
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:43,137
Who? Bill Gates?

139
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,436
Just someone. Anyway.

140
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:48,206
Ji Na.

141
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:51,046
Sit down for now. Okay?

142
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,477
Stop acting like an amateur.

143
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:56,446
You know better than anyone what you must do in this situation.

144
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:59,347
No, I don't. Should I die?

145
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:04,857
There is only one solution, Ms. Na.

146
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:07,056
What?

147
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:08,926
Write it all again within an hour.

148
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:10,196
What? My suicide note?

149
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,127
The chapter.

150
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,066
The chapter?

151
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,467
I'm going to the roof.

152
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,267
Finish your chapter first.

153
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:20,936
What's the point though?

154
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:22,206
No one likes it.

155
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:25,347
They don't like it much at the company either, right?

156
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,377
What did they say? Be honest.

157
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:30,887
It's boring.

158
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:34,357
I don't think romance is her forte.

159
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,186
The male protagonist is too bland.

160
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,857
The number of reads keeps dropping.

161
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:40,426
But once readers have to pay to read a story,

162
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,857
the number drops to half on average...

163
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:45,467
Jung Min, would you go out with that male protagonist?

164
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,767
- Excuse me? - Not me.

165
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,097
I'll ask her to reduce the number of chapters...

166
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,337
and to end it sooner.

167
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,176
Sure. Let's end this one.

168
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:56,107
Let's see how she does on her next story.

169
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:59,406
They said it's worth waiting and seeing.

170
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:02,316
Don't lie to me! The number of reads dropped to half.

171
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,347
Half the readers stop reading...

172
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:07,456
once they have to pay for the chapters.

173
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:11,087
That's true.

174
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:14,956
So let's just write, okay?

175
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,926
If you miss the upload time,

176
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:20,467
you'll lose the remaining half too.

177
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:22,036
Here.

178
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:26,536
Did you eat?

179
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:31,676
That's not real food.

180
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:32,946
This is filling.

181
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,546
I have no time to write, let alone cook.

182
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:37,587
This is much better than anything I cook...

183
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:38,816
in both taste and nutrition.

184
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,737
Ji Na...

185
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:06,406
Where do I even start?

186
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,747
What? Did you say something?

187
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,617
I'm going to run to the convenience store.

188
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,017
Okay.

189
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,566
Hello.

190
00:15:33,107 --> 00:15:35,276
(Mr. Jung Dang Myun)

191
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,076
Hello, Mr. Jung. May I help you with something?

192
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:41,446
You're the one who needs help, Ms. Tak Dong Kyung.

193
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,786
Why are you full-naming me?

194
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,587
Was there an error with the upload?

195
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:51,686
Are you even scared?

196
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:54,296
I'm calling as a doctor, not a writer.

197
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:56,897
I'm calling to threaten you.

198
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:00,997
I see. That.

199
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,837
You may feel fine now,

200
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,737
but it'll become so painful that you'll want to die.

201
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:06,367
This isn't a threat, it's a fact.

202
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,737
Will it keep getting worse?

203
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:10,706
Are you kidding me?

204
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:20,956
In other words, do I want to die after suffering tremendous pain...

205
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:25,326
or after suffering slightly milder than tremendous pain.

206
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,156
I have to choose one or the other, right?

207
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,296
I don't want either.

208
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,267
Don't think of doing anything rash.

209
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,196
Don't do that.

210
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:43,637
I already did something rash.

211
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,117
I don't regret it.

212
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:03,526
Doom is knocking at the door.

213
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:05,026
Repent and be saved.

214
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:08,237
(The world is coming to an end.)

215
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,566
- It is? - Yes.

216
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:13,637
The countless evil deeds that we've committed...

217
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:15,076
angered the Almighty.

218
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:16,977
For example,

219
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:19,647
the comets today were proof that the end is near.

220
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,516
Doom is coming. It's knocking at our door.

221
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:24,887
(The world is coming to an end.)

222
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:28,817
You're right.

223
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:38,496
The Almighty is angry. Doom is drawing near.

224
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,176
Are you angry?

225
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,506
I'm feeling fine today.

226
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,047
Maybe you will be angry soon.

227
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,716
You said to become a human's wish.

228
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:02,387
But that human's wish happens to be doom.

229
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:06,087
- That's amusing. - Isn't it?

230
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:09,327
Until now, humans only wished to win the lottery,

231
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:12,466
for their health or happiness, and things like that.

232
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,837
Do you know? If the garden is gone...

233
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,766
The gardener and the butterfly won't be needed anymore.

234
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:39,287
At least respond.

235
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:44,527
Do what you want. I plan to do what I want too.

236
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:50,736
Tell me this one thing.

237
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:54,637
Why me?

238
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:56,906
Who knows?

239
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:00,406
Fate?

240
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:05,916
That's cruel.

241
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:14,557
Fate is cruel to everyone.

242
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,436
You'll be punished if you do something bad.

243
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,006
I'm already being punished.

244
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:50,897
(Jo Scum)

245
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:53,127
You're screening my calls?

246
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,067
You'll regret it.

247
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,367
(You're screening my calls? You'll regret it.)

248
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:00,706
(You're screening my calls? You'll regret it.)

249
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:06,006
I said you'd regret it.

250
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,817
Ji Na, I need to rush back into the office.

251
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:17,726
Sorry. I'll buy dinner tomorrow.

252
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:18,726
What?

253
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:20,627
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

254
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:23,057
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

255
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:26,397
Tak Dong Kyung, who works here,

256
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:28,196
is a homewrecker.

257
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:31,166
She seduced me, a well-behaved, happily married man!

258
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,166
Seduced?

259
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,107
That doesn't belong in the same sentence as "Do Kyung".

260
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,906
The naive man that I am, I fell for it.

261
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:36,906
Naive?

262
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:39,906
And I ended up losing my precious wife!

263
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,446
How could this happen?

264
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:44,516
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

265
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:46,647
Excuse me. You can't do this in our office.

266
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,956
- Get out. - I'm angry, that's why.

267
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,956
Get out.

268
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:52,226
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

269
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,256
Let's talk outside.

270
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:57,256
You are just incredible.

271
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:00,226
How can you eat after ruining my life?

272
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,067
I said let's talk outside.

273
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,337
Forget it.

274
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,266
What did you say to my wife?

275
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,936
What did you say that she wants a divorce?

276
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:16,147
"I didn't know he was married."

277
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,986
"I was deceived."

278
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,047
"I did nothing wrong."

279
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,057
"He's the one who was wrong."

280
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,127
That's what I said. So?

281
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:27,686
I am dumbfounded.

282
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:31,327
Hey. It wasn't love for me.

283
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:32,966
How do I put it?

284
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:35,367
It just happened.

285
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:38,867
Even if we end it, we should have manners!

286
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:40,166
Manners?

287
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,006
You're talking about manners?

288
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:44,006
That's right! Manners! M-A-N-E-R!

289
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:45,406
M-A-N-N-E-R.

290
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,277
To be honest, what do you have to offer?

291
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:50,746
You don't have anything everyone else has.

292
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:53,516
You have no parents or money. What do you have?

293
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:00,827
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyung.

294
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:05,266
Should I make that wish right now?

295
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:06,827
What?

296
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,637
Forget it.

297
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:12,837
It'll be too much of a waste to use it on the likes of you.

298
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,176
Is this the time?

299
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:18,676
Is this the time for what?

300
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:20,476
Doom.

301
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,547
What are you babbling about?

302
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:24,516
I'm saying I want to kill you.

303
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:31,156
You can tell when someone grew up with no parents...

304
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:32,486
in these situations.

305
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:34,027
This is why...

306
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,797
I won't let my child grow up without a dad!

307
00:22:35,797 --> 00:22:36,857
Excuse me!

308
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,627
Excuse me. From what I can see,

309
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:41,127
you're the highest up here.

310
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,067
It's extremely bad for the company image...

311
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,837
to have an employee like her.

312
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:47,706
So... Wait. Hold on.

313
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:50,107
Darn it.

314
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:53,107
Don't let outsiders in so easily.

315
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,617
Is everyone okay?

316
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,686
I think the lunch gave me indigestion.

317
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:08,797
Fire the homewrecker...

318
00:23:08,797 --> 00:23:10,627
Tak Dong Kyung! Fire her!

319
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:13,466
- I'm this nitwit's wife. - What...

320
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:15,266
- Everything he says is a lie. - Honey.

321
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,936
- Sorry for the trouble. - Wait.

322
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:19,266
I was about to leave. You have the wrong idea.

323
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,466
- Hey. - Let's go.

324
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:23,176
Honey, the baby. Be careful of the baby.

325
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,537
Hey, you, Dong Kyung!

326
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:26,476
Hold on. Honey!

327
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:28,777
I'll kill you!

328
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,016
- Darn it. - Shut it!

329
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:35,516
Wow. Gosh.

330
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,637
("Life" group chat)

331
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:28,676
(I'm staring at the clock. I'm getting coffee.)

332
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,547
Big news. You'll never guess what happened in our office.

333
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:36,916
If I hear anyone typing, I will kill you.

334
00:24:42,756 --> 00:24:43,756
Hey!

335
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:47,426
It wasn't me.

336
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,077
(Resignation)

337
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,047
I'll resign.

338
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:15,416
I don't have the authority.

339
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:17,857
Mr. Park isn't in right now.

340
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:19,787
Please submit it for me.

341
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:20,887
I can't be bothered.

342
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,857
And it isn't business hours yet.

343
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:28,496
- When will Mr. Park be back? - I don't know.

344
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,297
Excuse me?

345
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:34,107
He went to Bali with his girlfriend to celebrate making up.

346
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:45,486
Bali to make it up to my queen.

347
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:47,347
A man in charge of a company.

348
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:52,256
However, for tonight, a man who exists for one woman.

349
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:54,357
Looking good, sir.

350
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,726
Enjoy your vacation.

351
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:59,127
Enjoy a long vacation, sir.

352
00:26:00,897 --> 00:26:04,297
(Like)

353
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:29,256
Recharge.

354
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:33,666
Why couldn't you cross the street?

355
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:37,196
- I was too scared. - Then you should've called me.

356
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,337
- How? - However.

357
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,037
You sound like you're on my side.

358
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,077
That's all in your head.

359
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:44,976
How was your day?

360
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:47,077
Why are you asking that?

361
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:48,577
Who knows?

362
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:50,476
You may want to bring doom today.

363
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,347
That will make things easier.

364
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:56,016
I have a question.

365
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,327
What happens if I break this contract?

366
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:02,597
If you break it?

367
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:05,397
What if I don't feel pain until I die and get my wish,

368
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:08,137
but I die without asking you to end this world?

369
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:15,107
Will you do that?

370
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,746
Then someone else will die instead of you.

371
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:26,547
The person you love the most at that moment.

372
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:31,057
What? What do you...

373
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:33,726
I'll remove the doom from here to there.

374
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:36,656
It's simple.

375
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,996
That's not what you promised.

376
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:40,666
I made no promise.

377
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:42,466
All contracts have penalties for breaches.

378
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:46,337
I don't know. Regardless, you've entered into a contract.

379
00:27:46,337 --> 00:27:47,537
It's a done deal.

380
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,107
You fraud.

381
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,686
Would it have been different if you had known?

382
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:06,627
I doubt that.

383
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:23,976
Okay. I'll be fair.

384
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,176
I'll give you another chance to choose.

385
00:28:26,176 --> 00:28:27,307
What will you do now?

386
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,216
Choose quickly. You'll die at that rate.

387
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,216
Hey.

388
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:36,057
When you gain something, you must lose something.

389
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:37,287
Think hard.

390
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:40,256
Everything you've gained in life were thanks to things you lost.

391
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:42,057
Why?

392
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:44,397
Why me?

393
00:28:44,627 --> 00:28:47,327
Why? Why must it be me?

394
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:55,436
Fate.

395
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,676
That's cruel.

396
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,686
Fate is cruel to everyone.

397
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,597
Stop! Stop it!

398
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:40,347
See?

399
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:49,097
Scumbag.

400
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:53,696
I've heard that so much.

401
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:56,297
Is it fun toying with me?

402
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,666
Like I said, I'm not on your side.

403
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:02,077
It was your choice.

404
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:05,777
And naturally, I will always respect your decision.

405
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:12,686
Will you keep standing here?

406
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:16,986
Fine, suit yourself. I'm going to cross.

407
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:19,226
It's getting boring.

408
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:50,416
Why?

409
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,496
Why me?

410
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:58,466
Why? Why must it be me?

411
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:00,966
Why me?

412
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:04,166
Fate?

413
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,067
That's cruel.

414
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,027
Dong Kyung!

415
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:33,996
I got your favourite rice cake.

416
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,897
Look. I bought a lot.

417
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,936
Then someone else will die instead of you.

418
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,577
The person you love the most at that moment.

419
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,047
What's wrong?

420
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,016
I took care of the insurance matter.

421
00:31:57,787 --> 00:31:58,926
It turned out...

422
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:01,996
the owner of the rental car company was my classmate's brother's...

423
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:04,797
distant aunt's fourth cousin...

424
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:09,367
Anyway, it was someone I knew so I got it resolved.

425
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:10,397
It's true!

426
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,676
What's wrong?

427
00:32:16,877 --> 00:32:18,107
Were you drinking?

428
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,216
Did you come up with a new way to kill me?

429
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:25,117
Dong Kyung.

430
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:13,226
Excuse me. One roll of gimbap please.

431
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:14,266
Okay.

432
00:33:15,837 --> 00:33:18,196
That's a dollar. Thank you.

433
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:21,107
I'm so angry.

434
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:25,006
The most important thing is to keep them wanting more.

435
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:26,647
You have to play hard to get.

436
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:30,547
That way, the readers will wonder what happens to the characters...

437
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:32,887
and will drool and follow us.

438
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,787
Know what I mean?

439
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:38,627
It should be like a skirt that you can almost look up.

440
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:42,857
A shirt?

441
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:47,597
Does the author Lee Hyun not go to the office much?

442
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:49,597
Pardon?

443
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:54,236
I hear she's really pretty.

444
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:56,377
I hear you two are close.

445
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:58,006
Let me meet her.

446
00:33:58,006 --> 00:33:59,006
Who knows?

447
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:00,877
Writers get each other.

448
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,377
If we hit it off,

449
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:03,476
we may...

450
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:05,446
You know.

451
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:09,387
People need to know their place.

452
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:11,716
What?

453
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:16,426
Him.

454
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:17,756
This wrinkly old man...

455
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,527
doesn't know his place and does what he does.

456
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:21,726
Did you do that on purpose?

457
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,096
Does he die later on?

458
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:28,706
That has nothing to do with social perspective.

459
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:31,737
It's a set-up to accentuate a truly pure, innocent love.

460
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,706
That's the kind of jerk...

461
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:36,717
that lies about his marital status to lure an ordinary single woman.

462
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,116
What?

463
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:41,717
Why does social perspective have nothing to do with love?

464
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:44,087
Love that goes beyond social perspective is a crime.

465
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:46,226
Is he a criminal?

466
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:48,826
Ms. Tak. How can you say that?

467
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:50,427
What's wrong?

468
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,826
I'm in awe because your writing is so realistic.

469
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:57,596
You weren't like this.

470
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,737
People who suddenly change die soon.

471
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:02,536
Is this because I asked about Lee Hyun?

472
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:05,806
No. It's because my time's almost up.

473
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:10,016
I'm already wondering if it's today or tomorrow.

474
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:12,217
What? Where are you going when we're still talking?

475
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:15,286
I'm off to see the pretty Lee Hyun.

476
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:28,127
- It's because of a man. - A man?

477
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:31,397
What man? I don't even know a male insect.

478
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:33,436
Think carefully.

479
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:35,837
He's very close to water.

480
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:36,976
Water?

481
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,746
He's standing right in your way.

482
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:44,976
You're being dragged down by a ghost that drowned!

483
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,717
You can't change your pen name now.

484
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:53,157
The fortune-teller told me to get rid of everything about him.

485
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:55,797
- Thanks. I'll enjoy the food. - Sure.

486
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:58,357
Why did I take his name as my pen name?

487
00:35:58,596 --> 00:36:00,467
And why did he have to swim?

488
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:02,436
It's really chilling.

489
00:36:02,436 --> 00:36:04,197
How did she know about water?

490
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:06,007
Ji Na, who is this fortune-teller?

491
00:36:06,907 --> 00:36:09,177
Why? Is something not working out?

492
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,576
Work's a problem.

493
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,076
Will you change jobs?

494
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:14,976
Do it. If you don't like it, jump ship.

495
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,547
There are many other publishers.

496
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:19,087
I don't exactly want to jump ship.

497
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:23,857
- Tak. - What?

498
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:27,927
Should I...

499
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:30,556
quit writing?

500
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,297
Ji Na!

501
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:33,927
I'll cook the rice for you.

502
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:56,456
You can eat once the cheese melts.

503
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,027
Ji Na.

504
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:05,397
What do you want to do if you die in 100 days?

505
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,797
Why? Am I dying?

506
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:09,567
I'm just curious.

507
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:13,706
First, I want to buy a five-tier cake and eat it whole.

508
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:17,277
- What else? - I guess I'd go travelling.

509
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:19,377
What else?

510
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:21,377
What else?

511
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,416
I don't know. I never thought about it.

512
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:30,116
I thought about it just now, while our rice was being cooked.

513
00:37:33,326 --> 00:37:36,197
I want to die after making you a success.

514
00:37:43,397 --> 00:37:44,967
That's why I'll say this.

515
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:49,936
It'll be shocking, but don't be too shocked.

516
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:00,817
Quit publishing serially.

517
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:04,686
Not right away but within the month.

518
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:07,587
Consider it wrapping up your story short.

519
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,357
It's all his fault.

520
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:14,366
Lee Hyun Kyu, the darn water ghost.

521
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,067
Also, this isn't that big of a deal,

522
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:20,136
but it turned out that my boyfriend...

523
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,936
was a married man.

524
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:23,706
What?

525
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:25,907
He's insane!

526
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,407
You saw it for yourselves,

527
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,116
and you have brains to think with.

528
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:36,456
What do you think, Mr. Cha?

529
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,416
I have no thoughts.

530
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,956
Okay. Go on having no thoughts.

531
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:42,127
Jung Min?

532
00:38:43,297 --> 00:38:45,897
Whatever the situation may be,

533
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:46,927
it's a fact it was an affair.

534
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:48,027
Would she do that?

535
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:49,697
You can never truly know someone.

536
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:51,866
The guy looked pretty loaded.

537
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,107
Would you like anyone with money?

538
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:56,206
Why don't you seduce our CEO, then?

539
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:57,476
What does that mean?

540
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,706
You seemed to envy her for dating a rich guy.

541
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:02,916
You're gutsy for saying that to his face.

542
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:05,116
I suddenly feel sick.

543
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:07,016
I think we reached an agreement. Let's go.

544
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:09,456
We can't leave work on time, so let's try to do less overtime.

545
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:11,556
- I'm not yet... - You haven't agreed?

546
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:14,127
I have.

547
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:17,427
Guess what?

548
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:20,527
The café owner's dad owns this building.

549
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:21,527
- No way. - No way.

550
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,636
Welcome. Just a moment.

551
00:39:23,636 --> 00:39:25,366
- He must live in the penthouse. - Come by again.

552
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:27,407
I heard the landlord's son stays here to maintain the building.

553
00:39:27,737 --> 00:39:29,677
Then the yellow sports car in the basement parking...

554
00:39:29,677 --> 00:39:31,536
must be his as well.

555
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:32,777
I heard it belongs to the landlord's son.

556
00:39:32,777 --> 00:39:33,777
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

557
00:39:36,116 --> 00:39:38,116
- Bye. - Take care.

558
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:42,357
Welcome back.

559
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:48,027
- I thought you quit. - You said no.

560
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:50,056
Why won't you go home, then?

561
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,627
I have some editing to do.

562
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:53,596
Why work hard if you're going to quit?

563
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:56,636
Will you do this for me, then?

564
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:58,397
Work hard.

565
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:00,837
What did Ms. Lee Hyun say?

566
00:40:01,806 --> 00:40:03,837
She said yes.

567
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:06,246
She knows better than anyone her work isn't that popular.

568
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:08,476
What did you and Jijo talk about?

569
00:40:08,476 --> 00:40:10,217
It's Jijo King, not just Jijo.

570
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:12,487
I can't bear saying his full name.

571
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:14,016
I criticized him a bit.

572
00:40:14,016 --> 00:40:17,016
What's the occasion? You never criticize anyone.

573
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:18,357
Good for you.

574
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:21,157
He wants a different editor. Someone pretty.

575
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:24,326
Does he think we edit with our looks? That's just stupid.

576
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:25,927
Pretty Jung Min can handle him.

577
00:40:26,496 --> 00:40:28,427
- Am I pretty? - Yuck.

578
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:30,897
Sorry. I have a weak stomach.

579
00:40:31,337 --> 00:40:33,907
I said I'd edit his work. I'm the prettiest here.

580
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,507
Why did you date someone like that?

581
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,516
I was working at a café...

582
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:45,547
and someone passing by almost spilled coffee on my laptop.

583
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:48,616
I'd almost finished editing about 80 episodes worth of a novel.

584
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:53,257
He suddenly showed up and shielded me with his body.

585
00:40:53,427 --> 00:40:55,056
- He scored. - He scored.

586
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,297
He scored.

587
00:40:56,297 --> 00:40:59,826
I said I'd pay for the dry-cleaning and he asked me out for coffee.

588
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:02,897
And you saw the rest.

589
00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:04,636
I did. It must've been tough.

590
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:02,257
I can only fill this many pages.

591
00:42:05,627 --> 00:42:07,826
In movies or dramas,

592
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:10,096
people who are about to die...

593
00:42:10,096 --> 00:42:12,806
leave everything behind just fine.

594
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:15,666
And think of a wish,

595
00:42:16,107 --> 00:42:17,277
Tak Dong Kyung.

596
00:42:19,846 --> 00:42:23,177
I have no money to spend, dreams to achieve,

597
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:25,786
or love to work on.

598
00:42:27,286 --> 00:42:30,686
If I had 10 years to live, I'd want money, dreams,

599
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:32,556
or even love,

600
00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:36,456
but I only have 100 days left.

601
00:42:36,496 --> 00:42:38,527
Then someone else will die instead of you.

602
00:42:39,127 --> 00:42:41,226
The person you love the most at that moment.

603
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:44,366
The life I'll live after that...

604
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:48,107
is nothing short of doom.

605
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:51,177
You wanted this world to end.

606
00:42:56,547 --> 00:42:58,047
I'm exhausted.

607
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:02,857
Does everyone live like this?

608
00:43:03,616 --> 00:43:06,956
Being harassed by both...

609
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:08,786
life and death?

610
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:16,666
As if they're neither alive nor dead?

611
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:20,366
(5th Ward)

612
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,346
- Ms. Kim, the defibrillator. - Okay.

613
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:50,866
Are you all right?

614
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:15,757
I don't think I'll see my 20th birthday in this lifetime.

615
00:44:17,357 --> 00:44:21,297
What kind of deity is always sick to death or dead sad?

616
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:24,837
Someone has to pay the price for this world to exist.

617
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:26,866
Is the price tag this time a heart disease?

618
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:33,806
I think it's because people here call for the deity the most.

619
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:38,147
True. They called you to be born.

620
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,487
I opened my eyes the moment a lot of people called out for me.

621
00:44:42,217 --> 00:44:44,717
So I will willingly pay the price.

622
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:49,397
That is the job of a deity the people called upon and...

623
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:52,326
your job as the creation of a deity.

624
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:57,197
You already know that...

625
00:44:57,397 --> 00:44:59,507
you cannot avoid your fate.

626
00:45:03,737 --> 00:45:06,007
She will not give up on the world.

627
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:07,377
Not like you did.

628
00:45:09,947 --> 00:45:12,016
I will make her give up on it.

629
00:45:12,116 --> 00:45:13,217
Will you?

630
00:45:14,487 --> 00:45:16,686
Even if you do, will it be possible?

631
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:19,326
Humans created the deity. Of course they can bring doom to this world.

632
00:45:19,326 --> 00:45:21,226
You and I both are humans' will.

633
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:23,427
Then I must do whatever it takes.

634
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:26,397
Because that's not all the humans want.

635
00:45:28,197 --> 00:45:30,596
You should go before midnight.

636
00:45:36,936 --> 00:45:39,007
The deity is never ignorant.

637
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:41,507
We just pretend to be.

638
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:00,297
Are you ready?

639
00:46:00,297 --> 00:46:01,996
One, two.

640
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:05,237
I'll take one more.

641
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,306
No. Smile brightly.

642
00:46:11,277 --> 00:46:12,476
Do you have a death wish?

643
00:46:13,306 --> 00:46:15,476
- Pardon? - Why are you here?

644
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:17,717
Do you want another slap?

645
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:22,116
Is that how you usually apologize?

646
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:24,286
I don't feel sorry.

647
00:46:24,817 --> 00:46:27,027
You can fight after I take your photo.

648
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:29,127
Smile.

649
00:46:29,797 --> 00:46:31,956
Smile. He wants you to.

650
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:44,677
Can you shave a little more off my chin?

651
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,706
Then it won't be your face.

652
00:46:47,206 --> 00:46:49,916
- Does that matter? - It does.

653
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:52,416
ID photos are used to identify you.

654
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:55,547
This isn't for an ID.

655
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:59,217
Print it out in that size.

656
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,657
And frame it too.

657
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:02,826
It's usually black, right?

658
00:47:04,127 --> 00:47:07,527
Shall I make your eyes bigger too?

659
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:09,397
- Yes. - Then...

660
00:47:26,116 --> 00:47:28,587
Do you have to do this? A car would be more comfortable.

661
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:30,257
I won't ride your car.

662
00:47:30,357 --> 00:47:31,916
Who knows what'll happen?

663
00:47:32,857 --> 00:47:34,326
Then take a bus.

664
00:47:34,627 --> 00:47:37,927
Don't talk to me. I feel like walking in silence.

665
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,666
You waste your time.

666
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,837
Shouldn't you be trying to spend every second well?

667
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,507
You only look at me when I pick a fight.

668
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,047
Humans are really weird.

669
00:47:57,047 --> 00:47:58,717
Why make things like that?

670
00:47:58,717 --> 00:48:00,246
You never get to see them yourself.

671
00:48:00,647 --> 00:48:02,916
It's for others, not me.

672
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:05,786
I'm like that sometimes.

673
00:48:08,127 --> 00:48:09,797
Then you decided to die.

674
00:48:10,826 --> 00:48:13,467
Do things like you only care about yourselves?

675
00:48:17,496 --> 00:48:20,607
You have no idea how much I put others first.

676
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:22,266
Look at me now.

677
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,507
You slapped me, but I'm here to save you.

678
00:48:34,016 --> 00:48:35,186
Time's ticking.

679
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:53,907
Get used to it, if you want to walk with me.

680
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,576
Did you do that?

681
00:49:00,877 --> 00:49:02,407
I didn't do it,

682
00:49:03,877 --> 00:49:05,476
but it is because of me.

683
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:18,697
(911 Ambulance)

684
00:49:19,197 --> 00:49:20,627
Was that you too?

685
00:49:21,027 --> 00:49:22,067
Sometimes.

686
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,206
(18 traffic accidents yesterday in Seoul, 2 dead, 8 injured)

687
00:49:27,366 --> 00:49:28,507
Yes.

688
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,447
How do you live like that?

689
00:49:35,746 --> 00:49:38,076
I don't live. I just exist.

690
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,257
I'm just a button of doom.

691
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:47,487
Every step I take, every move my hand makes,

692
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:50,197
every breath I take.

693
00:49:51,797 --> 00:49:53,996
Everything about me leads to doom.

694
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:56,337
I exist for that.

695
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:02,306
And if you don't do anything?

696
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:05,777
What if you don't do anything?

697
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,616
All hell breaks out on earth.

698
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:14,746
Unusual temperatures persist and the cause is yet unknown.

699
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:17,087
It's October, and all over the country,

700
00:50:17,087 --> 00:50:18,357
heat waves and drought...

701
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:20,326
This year's harvest is a disaster.

702
00:50:20,326 --> 00:50:22,257
- There's no point. - I hate the world.

703
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:24,556
- It's crazy. - It's insane.

704
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:27,596
- How can he kill his kid? - Why won't Mom just die?

705
00:50:27,596 --> 00:50:30,737
- You darn scumbag. - Why won't a deity kill him first?

706
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:39,177
"If you gain something, you lose something."

707
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:43,976
"Everything you've gained in life were thanks to things you lost."

708
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:47,616
I get what that means now.

709
00:50:49,016 --> 00:50:51,386
You need winter to have spring,

710
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:54,556
and darkness to have light.

711
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:59,967
Death must exist for life. It's like that, isn't it?

712
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:05,297
So you are winter, darkness,

713
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:07,166
and death.

714
00:51:10,407 --> 00:51:11,476
Yes.

715
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:14,777
Like you said, you really do care for nothing but others.

716
00:51:16,346 --> 00:51:19,217
You just had to come to me when you cared only about yourself.

717
00:51:25,257 --> 00:51:27,326
How long must we hold hands for?

718
00:51:32,157 --> 00:51:34,366
I thought you held on because you liked it.

719
00:51:57,087 --> 00:51:59,857
Why follow me all the way here? It's too much pressure.

720
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,826
But thanks anyway.

721
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:05,627
You can go now. I won't run away again.

722
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:07,096
Shall we meet again tomorrow?

723
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:09,996
- What? - Shall I come for you?

724
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:13,206
It's up to you.

725
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,706
Why are you like this so suddenly?

726
00:52:17,036 --> 00:52:19,476
Why do I care whether you crawl in pain or not?

727
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:23,116
Do you have a mood disorder or something?

728
00:52:23,116 --> 00:52:24,616
Why do you suddenly change tune?

729
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:27,846
Hey, things were nice between us just now.

730
00:52:27,846 --> 00:52:31,217
We were beginning to understand and figure out each other.

731
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:33,587
I'm saying you should be more clingy.

732
00:52:34,226 --> 00:52:35,686
To you?

733
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,357
To your fate that came to you.

734
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:51,407
Hey, Tak Dong Kyung.

735
00:52:57,047 --> 00:52:58,177
Tak Dong Kyung.

736
00:52:58,877 --> 00:53:00,087
What do you want?

737
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:02,516
I don't see straight right now.

738
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:11,357
I was out of my mind, Dong Kyung.

739
00:53:12,697 --> 00:53:15,427
I didn't mean what I said.

740
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,536
It shouldn't be past tense. You still are out of your mind.

741
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:20,507
You have completely lost it!

742
00:53:20,507 --> 00:53:23,737
We loved each other. We were in love!

743
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:26,746
What I said at your work wasn't true. That was nonsense.

744
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:29,206
This is how I truly feel. I'm drunk but honest.

745
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:30,576
Yes, "Drunk Honesty".

746
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:32,177
I sang that song for you many times.

747
00:53:32,177 --> 00:53:33,386
Don't you remember?

748
00:53:34,116 --> 00:53:37,157
Let go of me. I said let go!

749
00:53:37,717 --> 00:53:40,587
If you're drunk, go home! Why did you come here?

750
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:46,627
Yes, I might be drunk

751
00:53:46,897 --> 00:53:50,837
This might be a mistake

752
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:54,436
Every morning

753
00:53:55,936 --> 00:53:58,706
Now I will confess

754
00:53:58,706 --> 00:54:02,007
I loved you from the start

755
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,516
Let go of me.

756
00:54:04,516 --> 00:54:06,016
Let go of me already.

757
00:54:06,147 --> 00:54:09,217
Get out of my life!

758
00:54:09,616 --> 00:54:12,757
My awkward ramblings

759
00:54:12,757 --> 00:54:13,886
Darn you.

760
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:16,627
- I may be crude - Let go!

761
00:54:16,627 --> 00:54:19,427
- I may not sound trustworthy - Oh, gosh. Let go!

762
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:22,366
Who are you?

763
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,996
Let go. Let go of me!

764
00:54:26,936 --> 00:54:28,107
Was that a wish?

765
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:30,907
- What? - "Get out of my life."

766
00:54:31,407 --> 00:54:33,846
Are you crazy? Why would I waste my wish on him?

767
00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:36,107
Will you let go of me?

768
00:54:36,246 --> 00:54:38,277
Then shall I get rid of him like this?

769
00:54:41,647 --> 00:54:42,717
Honey.

770
00:54:46,056 --> 00:54:47,226
"Honey"?

771
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:48,487
Your husband.

772
00:54:48,627 --> 00:54:50,697
"Honey"? Tak Dong Kyung, who is this jerk?

773
00:54:50,697 --> 00:54:54,027
This must be the sicko you were talking about.

774
00:54:54,897 --> 00:54:57,266
Leave him to me. Go inside and have dinner.

775
00:54:57,766 --> 00:54:59,766
I made cold cucumber soup, your favourite, sweetie.

776
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:01,766
"Sweetie"?

777
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,476
Cold cucumber soup?

778
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,947
Tak Dong Kyung.

779
00:55:07,377 --> 00:55:10,116
Were you seeing someone? Were you living with someone?

780
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,076
This actually works much better.

781
00:55:13,386 --> 00:55:16,487
I lied about being married and you that you live with a guy.

782
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:19,016
That makes us even. We can start over, can't we?

783
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,286
What are you lot doing?

784
00:55:26,726 --> 00:55:27,797
What's going on?

785
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:28,996
Hey.

786
00:55:30,297 --> 00:55:32,197
It's not what you think. Don't.

787
00:55:32,197 --> 00:55:34,436
Who is married and who's she living with?

788
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:36,907
I'll whack the married one first.

789
00:55:37,777 --> 00:55:40,607
- No, wait, why... - Hey.

790
00:55:40,607 --> 00:55:42,576
- Hey. - What are you doing?

791
00:55:42,947 --> 00:55:44,846
- Come here! - Darn it.

792
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,186
Shoot.

793
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:28,556
It's hilarious.

794
00:56:31,857 --> 00:56:33,266
Just dumbfounding.

795
00:56:37,366 --> 00:56:39,636
Leave it. I'll clean it up.

796
00:56:39,737 --> 00:56:40,806
Thanks for help...

797
00:56:54,587 --> 00:56:56,346
I said I'd make it so you don't hurt.

798
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,127
I see why you thought of me.

799
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:09,596
I wondered what kind of person would make that wish at that time.

800
00:57:11,897 --> 00:57:13,706
I wasn't thinking of you.

801
00:57:14,237 --> 00:57:15,866
I am doom myself.

802
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:20,206
You were the only person who had the same thought at the same time.

803
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,317
I'm grateful.

804
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,647
In many ways.

805
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:49,936
Hey.

806
00:57:57,217 --> 00:57:58,476
This won't do.

807
00:58:02,047 --> 00:58:03,357
Let's live together.

808
00:58:04,686 --> 00:58:05,717
You and me.

809
00:59:14,456 --> 00:59:17,257
(Doom at Your Service)

810
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:19,797
Why did I ask him to live with me?

811
00:59:19,797 --> 00:59:20,927
Embarrassment lasts but just a second.

812
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:23,027
- Hi, brother-in-law. - Hey.

813
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:26,397
What are all these bottles? And this sofa?

814
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:27,706
Where do I sleep?

815
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:29,306
Was that him?

816
00:59:29,907 --> 00:59:31,536
The one you love the most.

817
00:59:32,407 --> 00:59:35,377
Can't you change his fate?

818
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,016
Give me your hand.

819
00:59:37,476 --> 00:59:38,647
I'm not human.

820
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:40,047
I feel no pity or love.

821
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:41,717
I don't have that kind of feeling.

822
00:59:41,717 --> 00:59:44,317
I do, because I'm human.

823
00:59:44,317 --> 00:59:47,627
So become the first human to love me.
