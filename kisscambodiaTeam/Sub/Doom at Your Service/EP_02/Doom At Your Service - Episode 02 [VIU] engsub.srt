1
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:03,207
(Doom at Your Service)

2
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:06,277
(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

3
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:08,847
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

4
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,547
The deity is on my side.

5
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:47,386
Choose. Will you die here and now?

6
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,026
Or will you take my hand?

7
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:56,267
And the answer is...

8
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:58,336
Me.

9
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:23,346
Don't let go.

10
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,227
Don't let go unless you want to die right now.

11
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:44,366
(Episode 2)

12
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,746
How is this possible?

13
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:50,007
All we did was go back in time.

14
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:53,177
- It's nothing that grand. - Not that.

15
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,586
Your...

16
00:03:57,816 --> 00:03:59,216
How do I put it?

17
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:02,786
I'm searching for a term that won't sound rude.

18
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,556
- My identity? - Yes.

19
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:08,227
Are you suspicious or curious?

20
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,727
Neither. I'm simply being rational.

21
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,197
But you saw earlier.

22
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,936
You experienced it first hand. Accept it.

23
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:15,137
That's easier said than done.

24
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:17,306
- You're alive right now. - So?

25
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:20,107
It was Switzerland and then Italy outside your door.

26
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:21,906
So?

27
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:24,406
In your dream, on the subway, and at work.

28
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:25,577
Don't you remember?

29
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:28,647
I do remember. But it makes no sense.

30
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:31,257
I feel like I've gone insane.

31
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:37,627
Okay. Watch.

32
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,057
What?

33
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:43,426
- Oh my gosh. - Did the lights go out?

34
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:45,536
What's wrong with this?

35
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:49,137
What about this?

36
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,776
That's odd. What's going on?

37
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,947
A timely coincidence?

38
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:00,716
- What's going on? - My phone turned off.

39
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:03,017
- Why did it suddenly turn off? - It won't work.

40
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:05,586
Did the battery die?

41
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:09,257
A timely coincidence?

42
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:11,926
I see.

43
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:16,267
Are you an electric type?

44
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:26,807
- Look. - What's that in the sky?

45
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:29,577
Are they comets?

46
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,007
My gosh.

47
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:37,216
Comets out of the blue?

48
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:39,517
Okay. I get it, so stop.

49
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:42,156
Why? I didn't do that.

50
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,526
I'm an electric type.

51
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,127
I said to stop it.

52
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,226
Stop it.

53
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,707
What's going on?

54
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:01,276
The power's back.

55
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,676
I'm not very nice.

56
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:06,117
My phone turned back on too.

57
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,187
That's with whom you entered into a contract.

58
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:10,687
Remember that I'm evil.

59
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,776
I need to stop fooling around, and go.

60
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:34,807
- All of a sudden? - Something annoying happened.

61
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,476
Consider that a show to commemorate our contract.

62
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,916
I hope you enjoy yourself.

63
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,166
You didn't want to hold it before. Now, you don't want to let go?

64
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,067
You said not to let go.

65
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:15,286
- What's this? - My promise.

66
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:17,346
I said I'd make sure you don't feel pain.

67
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,356
Don't relax too much.

68
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:28,226
You have to recharge it once a day before midnight.

69
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:30,026
Recharge it? How?

70
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:32,096
- By holding my hand. - What? Why?

71
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:33,367
In case you run away.

72
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,707
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyung.

73
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:46,747
Hey. How do you know my name?

74
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:47,747
Hey!

75
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:04,666
Excuse me.

76
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:06,536
Yes?

77
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:09,106
Do you remember the crosswalk earlier?

78
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,377
- You don't remember? - No, I don't.

79
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:16,906
I guess it really didn't happen.

80
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,847
You're such high maintenance.

81
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:05,727
I'll kill you in due time.

82
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:19,837
I said not to park your car in my spot,

83
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:22,046
but you keep trying.

84
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:24,507
Doom is my domain.

85
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,217
Do something.

86
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,217
I keep hearing the voices.

87
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:35,926
I can't sleep. It's driving me crazy.

88
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:38,826
- Die. - You piece of trash.

89
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:40,796
- Stop. - Coward.

90
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:41,997
- Die. - He deserves to die.

91
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:43,267
Die, you murderer.

92
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,737
- Coward. - Die.

93
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:46,436
He should be ripped apart!

94
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:48,137
- Die! - Die.

95
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,166
How does it feel?

96
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,137
I deal with it every day.

97
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:55,007
Please kill me! I'm begging you!

98
00:09:57,276 --> 00:09:59,477
Three of the people you stabbed died.

99
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,946
Two of them are still in a coma.

100
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:05,056
But you're alive and well. You should thank me.

101
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,816
That wasn't my plan.

102
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:10,656
It wasn't.

103
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:13,397
Life doesn't go as planned.

104
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:15,326
I'll stop here for today.

105
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,597
I got a good contract today, so I'm feeling chipper.

106
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:21,397
Who are you?

107
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:23,066
Have you ever heard this phrase?

108
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:27,406
"I am the first and the last, the beginning and the end."

109
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:34,676
I'm that. The last. The end.

110
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:43,257
Hey!

111
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:51,127
Why are you doing this to me? What do you want?

112
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:53,237
Doom.

113
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:01,276
(Jo Scum)

114
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:03,576
Why is he calling me?

115
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:19,026
Hey. I know you won't believe what I'm about to tell you,

116
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:21,426
but hear me out without giving me lip...

117
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:22,426
Hello?

118
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,727
Ji Na!

119
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:26,897
Ji Na!

120
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,007
What's wrong?

121
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:30,936
What is it? What's wrong?

122
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:32,837
I'm going to die.

123
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:36,107
- What? - I'm going to die!

124
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:38,276
Why?

125
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,987
Wait. Don't tell me...

126
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:47,286
I lost it all.

127
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:55,127
It's divine will.

128
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,436
My writing was garbage, so the powers at be deleted it.

129
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,267
They should've done it before I finished it.

130
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:04,977
What was with those comets?

131
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:06,607
What was with the power outage?

132
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,176
What else?

133
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:12,546
It's a sign that I should die.

134
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,686
Take care. Goodbye.

135
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:24,357
Why should you die?

136
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:26,127
This is all that jerk's fault.

137
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:30,826
That jerk?

138
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:34,137
Who? Bill Gates?

139
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,436
Just someone. Anyway.

140
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,206
Ji Na.

141
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,046
Sit down for now. Okay?

142
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:44,477
Stop acting like an amateur.

143
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:47,446
You know better than anyone what you must do in this situation.

144
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,347
No, I don't. Should I die?

145
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:55,857
There is only one solution, Ms. Na.

146
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,056
What?

147
00:12:58,056 --> 00:12:59,926
Write it all again within an hour.

148
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,196
What? My suicide note?

149
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:03,127
The chapter.

150
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,066
The chapter?

151
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:08,467
I'm going to the roof.

152
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,267
Finish your chapter first.

153
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,936
What's the point though?

154
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,206
No one likes it.

155
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,347
They don't like it much at the company either, right?

156
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,377
What did they say? Be honest.

157
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:21,887
It's boring.

158
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:25,357
I don't think romance is her forte.

159
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:27,186
The male protagonist is too bland.

160
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:28,857
The number of reads keeps dropping.

161
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:31,426
But once readers have to pay to read a story,

162
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:33,857
the number drops to half on average...

163
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:36,467
Jung Min, would you go out with that male protagonist?

164
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,767
- Excuse me? - Not me.

165
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,097
I'll ask her to reduce the number of chapters...

166
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,337
and to end it sooner.

167
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:45,176
Sure. Let's end this one.

168
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:47,107
Let's see how she does on her next story.

169
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:50,406
They said it's worth waiting and seeing.

170
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:53,316
Don't lie to me! The number of reads dropped to half.

171
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:56,347
Half the readers stop reading...

172
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:58,456
once they have to pay for the chapters.

173
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,087
That's true.

174
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:05,956
So let's just write, okay?

175
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,926
If you miss the upload time,

176
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:11,467
you'll lose the remaining half too.

177
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:13,036
Here.

178
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,536
Did you eat?

179
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,676
That's not real food.

180
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:23,946
This is filling.

181
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,546
I have no time to write, let alone cook.

182
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:28,587
This is much better than anything I cook...

183
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:29,816
in both taste and nutrition.

184
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,737
Ji Na...

185
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,406
Where do I even start?

186
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,747
What? Did you say something?

187
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,617
I'm going to run to the convenience store.

188
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:08,017
Okay.

189
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:16,566
Hello.

190
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:26,276
(Mr. Jung Dang Myun)

191
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:30,076
Hello, Mr. Jung. May I help you with something?

192
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:32,446
You're the one who needs help, Ms. Tak Dong Kyung.

193
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:36,786
Why are you full-naming me?

194
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,587
Was there an error with the upload?

195
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:42,686
Are you even scared?

196
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,296
I'm calling as a doctor, not a writer.

197
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,897
I'm calling to threaten you.

198
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:51,997
I see. That.

199
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:53,837
You may feel fine now,

200
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,737
but it'll become so painful that you'll want to die.

201
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,367
This isn't a threat, it's a fact.

202
00:15:58,237 --> 00:15:59,737
Will it keep getting worse?

203
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,706
Are you kidding me?

204
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:11,956
In other words, do I want to die after suffering tremendous pain...

205
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:16,326
or after suffering slightly milder than tremendous pain.

206
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:19,156
I have to choose one or the other, right?

207
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:22,296
I don't want either.

208
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:24,267
Don't think of doing anything rash.

209
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,196
Don't do that.

210
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:34,637
I already did something rash.

211
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,117
I don't regret it.

212
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:54,526
Doom is knocking at the door.

213
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:56,026
Repent and be saved.

214
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:59,237
(The world is coming to an end.)

215
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,566
- It is? - Yes.

216
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,637
The countless evil deeds that we've committed...

217
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,076
angered the Almighty.

218
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:07,977
For example,

219
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:10,647
the comets today were proof that the end is near.

220
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,516
Doom is coming. It's knocking at our door.

221
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:15,887
(The world is coming to an end.)

222
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:19,817
You're right.

223
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:29,496
The Almighty is angry. Doom is drawing near.

224
00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:40,176
Are you angry?

225
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:42,506
I'm feeling fine today.

226
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:44,047
Maybe you will be angry soon.

227
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:49,716
You said to become a human's wish.

228
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:53,387
But that human's wish happens to be doom.

229
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:57,087
- That's amusing. - Isn't it?

230
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:00,327
Until now, humans only wished to win the lottery,

231
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:03,466
for their health or happiness, and things like that.

232
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,837
Do you know? If the garden is gone...

233
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,766
The gardener and the butterfly won't be needed anymore.

234
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:30,287
At least respond.

235
00:18:32,397 --> 00:18:35,527
Do what you want. I plan to do what I want too.

236
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:41,736
Tell me this one thing.

237
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,637
Why me?

238
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:47,906
Who knows?

239
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:51,406
Fate?

240
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:56,916
That's cruel.

241
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,557
Fate is cruel to everyone.

242
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,436
You'll be punished if you do something bad.

243
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:19,006
I'm already being punished.

244
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:41,897
(Jo Scum)

245
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:44,127
You're screening my calls?

246
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,067
You'll regret it.

247
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,367
(You're screaning my calls? You'll reagret it.)

248
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:51,706
(You're screening my calls? You'll regret it.)

249
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:57,006
I said you'd regret it.

250
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,817
Ji Na, I need to rush back into the office.

251
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:08,726
Sorry. I'll buy dinner tomorrow.

252
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:09,726
What?

253
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,627
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

254
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:14,057
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

255
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,397
Tak Dong Kyung, who works here,

256
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,196
is a homewrecker.

257
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:22,166
She seduced me, a well-behaved, happily married man!

258
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,166
Seduced?

259
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,107
That doesn't belong in the same sentence as "Do Kyung".

260
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,906
The naive man that I am, I fell for it.

261
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:27,906
Naive?

262
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,906
And I ended up losing my precious wife!

263
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:32,446
How could this happen?

264
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:35,516
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

265
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:37,647
Excuse me. You can't do this in our office.

266
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:39,956
- Get out. - I'm angry, that's why.

267
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:40,956
Get out.

268
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,226
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

269
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:45,256
Let's talk outside.

270
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,256
You are just incredible.

271
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:51,226
How can you eat after ruining my life?

272
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:53,067
I said let's talk outside.

273
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,337
Forget it.

274
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,266
What did you say to my wife?

275
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,936
What did you say that she wants a divorce?

276
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:07,147
"I didn't know he was married."

277
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:08,986
"I was deceived."

278
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:11,047
"I did nothing wrong."

279
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:13,057
"He's the one who was wrong."

280
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:16,127
That's what I said. So?

281
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:18,686
I am dumbfounded.

282
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:22,327
Hey. It wasn't love for me.

283
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:23,966
How do I put it?

284
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:26,367
It just happened.

285
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:29,867
Even if we end it, we should have manners!

286
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:31,166
Manners?

287
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,006
You're talking about manners?

288
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:35,006
That's right! Manners! M-A-N-E-R!

289
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:36,406
M-A-N-N-E-R.

290
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:40,277
To be honest, what do you have to offer?

291
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:41,746
You don't have anything everyone else has.

292
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:44,516
You have no parents or money. What do you have?

293
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,827
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyung.

294
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,266
Should I make that wish right now?

295
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:57,827
What?

296
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:00,637
Forget it.

297
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:03,837
It'll be too much of a waste to use it on the likes of you.

298
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:07,176
Is this the time?

299
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:09,676
Is this the time for what?

300
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:11,476
Doom.

301
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,547
What are you babbling about?

302
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:15,516
I'm saying I want to kill you.

303
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:22,156
You can tell when someone grew up with no parents...

304
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:23,486
in these situations.

305
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:25,027
This is why...

306
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:26,797
I won't let my child grow up without a dad!

307
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:27,857
Excuse me!

308
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:30,627
Excuse me. From what I can see,

309
00:22:30,627 --> 00:22:32,127
you're the highest up here.

310
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:34,067
It's extremely bad for the company image...

311
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:35,837
to have an employee like her.

312
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:38,706
So... Wait. Hold on.

313
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:41,107
Darn it.

314
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:44,107
Don't let outsiders in so easily.

315
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,617
Is everyone okay?

316
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:55,686
I think the lunch gave me indigestion.

317
00:22:58,027 --> 00:22:59,797
Fire the homewrecker...

318
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:01,627
Tak Dong Kyung! Fire her!

319
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,466
- I'm this nitwit's wife. - What...

320
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,266
- Everything he says is a lie. - Honey.

321
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:07,936
- Sorry for the trouble. - Wait.

322
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:10,266
I was about to leave. You have the wrong idea.

323
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:11,466
- Hey. - Let's go.

324
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:14,176
Honey, the baby. Be careful of the baby.

325
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,537
Hey, you, Dong Kyung!

326
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:17,476
Hold on. Honey!

327
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:19,777
I'll kill you!

328
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:22,016
- Darn it. - Shut it!

329
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,516
Wow. Gosh.

330
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,637
("Life" group chat)

331
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:19,676
(I'm staring at the clock. I'm getting coffee.)

332
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:22,547
Big news. You'll never guess what happened in our office.

333
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:27,916
If I hear anyone typing, I will kill you.

334
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:34,756
Hey!

335
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,426
It wasn't me.

336
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:00,077
(Resignation)

337
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,047
I'll resign.

338
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:06,416
I don't have the authority.

339
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:08,857
Mr. Park isn't in right now.

340
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:10,787
Please submit it for me.

341
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:11,887
I can't be bothered.

342
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:14,857
And it isn't business hours yet.

343
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,496
- When will Mr. Park be back? - I don't know.

344
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:21,297
Excuse me?

345
00:25:22,436 --> 00:25:25,107
He went to Bali with his girlfriend to celebrate making up.

346
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:36,486
Bali to make it up to my queen.

347
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:38,347
A man in charge of a company.

348
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:43,256
However, for tonight, a man who exists for one woman.

349
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:45,357
Looking good, sir.

350
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:47,726
Enjoy your vacation.

351
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:50,127
Enjoy a long vacation, sir.

352
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,297
(Like)

353
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,256
Recharge.

354
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:24,666
Why couldn't you cross the street?

355
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:28,196
- I was too scared. - Then you should've called me.

356
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:30,337
- How? - However.

357
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,037
You sound like you're on my side.

358
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:34,077
That's all in your head.

359
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:35,976
How was your day?

360
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:38,077
Why are you asking that?

361
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:39,577
Who knows?

362
00:26:39,577 --> 00:26:41,476
You may want to bring doom today.

363
00:26:41,946 --> 00:26:43,347
That will make things easier.

364
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,016
I have a question.

365
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:50,327
What happens if I break this contract?

366
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:53,597
If you break it?

367
00:26:53,597 --> 00:26:56,397
What if I don't feel pain until I die and get my wish,

368
00:26:56,766 --> 00:26:59,137
but I die without asking you to end this world?

369
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:06,107
Will you do that?

370
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,746
Then someone else will die instead of you.

371
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:17,547
The person you love the most at that moment.

372
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:22,057
What? What do you...

373
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:24,726
I'll remove the doom from here to there.

374
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:27,656
It's simple.

375
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:29,996
That's not what you promised.

376
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:31,666
I made no promise.

377
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,466
All contracts have penalties for breaches.

378
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:37,337
I don't know. Regardless, you've entered into a contract.

379
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:38,537
It's a done deal.

380
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:44,107
You fraud.

381
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:49,686
Would it have been different if you had known?

382
00:27:56,627 --> 00:27:57,627
I doubt that.

383
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:14,976
Okay. I'll be fair.

384
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:17,176
I'll give you another chance to choose.

385
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:18,307
What will you do now?

386
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:24,216
Choose quickly. You'll die at that rate.

387
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:25,216
Hey.

388
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,057
When you gain something, you must lose something.

389
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:28,287
Think hard.

390
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:31,256
Everything you've gained in life were thanks to things you lost.

391
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:33,057
Why?

392
00:28:34,057 --> 00:28:35,397
Why me?

393
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:38,327
Why? Why must it be me?

394
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:46,436
Fate.

395
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:52,676
That's cruel.

396
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,686
Fate is cruel to everyone.

397
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:12,597
Stop! Stop it!

398
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:31,347
See?

399
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:40,097
Scumbag.

400
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:44,696
I've heard that so much.

401
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:47,297
Is it fun toying with me?

402
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:50,666
Like I said, I'm not on your side.

403
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:53,077
It was your choice.

404
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:56,777
And naturally, I will always respect your decision.

405
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:03,686
Will you keep standing here?

406
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:07,986
Fine, suit yourself. I'm going to cross.

407
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:10,226
It's getting boring.

408
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,416
Why?

409
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:46,496
Why me?

410
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:49,466
Why? Why must it be me?

411
00:30:50,797 --> 00:30:51,966
Why me?

412
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:55,166
Fate?

413
00:30:56,706 --> 00:30:58,067
That's cruel.

414
00:31:21,956 --> 00:31:23,027
Dong Kyung!

415
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:24,996
I got your favorite rice cake.

416
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:27,897
Look. I bought a lot.

417
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,936
Then someone else will die instead of you.

418
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:35,577
The person you love the most at that moment.

419
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:43,047
What's wrong?

420
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:48,016
I took care of the insurance matter.

421
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:49,926
It turned out...

422
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:52,996
the owner of the rental car company was my classmate's brother's...

423
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,797
distant aunt's fourth cousin...

424
00:31:57,627 --> 00:32:00,367
Anyway, it was someone I knew so I got it resolved.

425
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:01,397
It's true!

426
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:06,676
What's wrong?

427
00:32:07,877 --> 00:32:09,107
Were you drinking?

428
00:32:11,406 --> 00:32:13,216
Did you come up with a new way to kill me?

429
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:16,117
Dong Kyung.

430
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:04,226
Excuse me. One roll of gimbap please.

431
00:33:04,226 --> 00:33:05,266
Okay.

432
00:33:06,837 --> 00:33:09,196
That's a dollar. Thank you.

433
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,107
I'm so angry.

434
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:16,006
The most important thing is to keep them wanting more.

435
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:17,647
You have to play hard to get.

436
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:21,547
That way, the readers will wonder what happens to the characters...

437
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:23,887
and will drool and follow us.

438
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:25,787
Know what I mean?

439
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:29,627
It should be like a skirt that you can almost look up.

440
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:33,857
A shirt?

441
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:38,597
Does the author Lee Hyun not go to the office much?

442
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:40,597
Pardon?

443
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:45,236
I hear she's really pretty.

444
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,377
I hear you two are close.

445
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:49,006
Let me meet her.

446
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:50,006
Who knows?

447
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:51,877
Writers get each other.

448
00:33:51,877 --> 00:33:53,377
If we hit it off,

449
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:54,476
we may...

450
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:56,446
You know.

451
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:00,387
People need to know their place.

452
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:02,716
What?

453
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:07,426
Him.

454
00:34:07,426 --> 00:34:08,756
This wrinkly old man...

455
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,527
doesn't know his place and does what he does.

456
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,726
Did you do that on purpose?

457
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:14,096
Does he die later on?

458
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:19,706
That has nothing to do with social perspective.

459
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:22,737
It's a set-up to accentuate a truly pure, innocent love.

460
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:24,706
That's the kind of jerk...

461
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:27,717
that lies about his marital status to lure an ordinary single woman.

462
00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:29,116
What?

463
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:32,717
Why does social perspective have nothing to do with love?

464
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,087
Love that goes beyond social perspective is a crime.

465
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:37,226
Is he a criminal?

466
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:39,826
Ms. Tak. How can you say that?

467
00:34:40,357 --> 00:34:41,427
What's wrong?

468
00:34:41,757 --> 00:34:44,826
I'm in awe because your writing is so realistic.

469
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:48,596
You weren't like this.

470
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,737
People who suddenly change die soon.

471
00:34:51,737 --> 00:34:53,536
Is this because I asked about Lee Hyun?

472
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:56,806
No. It's because my time's almost up.

473
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:01,016
I'm already wondering if it's today or tomorrow.

474
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,217
What? Where are you going when we're still talking?

475
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:06,286
I'm off to see the pretty Lee Hyun.

476
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:19,127
- It's because of a man. - A man?

477
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:22,397
What man? I don't even know a male insect.

478
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:24,436
Think carefully.

479
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,837
He's very close to water.

480
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:27,976
Water?

481
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:32,746
He's standing right in your way.

482
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:35,976
You're being dragged down by a ghost that drowned!

483
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,717
You can't change your pen name now.

484
00:35:41,717 --> 00:35:44,157
The fortune-teller told me to get rid of everything about him.

485
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:46,797
- Thanks. I'll enjoy the food. - Sure.

486
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:49,357
Why did I take his name as my pen name?

487
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:51,467
And why did he have to swim?

488
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,436
It's really chilling.

489
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:55,197
How did she know about water?

490
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:57,007
Ji Na, who is this fortune-teller?

491
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,177
Why? Is something not working out?

492
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:02,576
Work's a problem.

493
00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:04,076
Will you change jobs?

494
00:36:04,107 --> 00:36:05,976
Do it. If you don't like it, jump ship.

495
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:07,547
There are many other publishers.

496
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:10,087
I don't exactly want to jump ship.

497
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:14,857
- Tak. - What?

498
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:18,927
Should I...

499
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:21,556
quit writing?

500
00:36:21,857 --> 00:36:23,297
Ji Na!

501
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:24,927
I'll cook the rice for you.

502
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:47,456
You can eat once the cheese melts.

503
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:53,027
Ji Na.

504
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:56,397
What do you want to do if you die in 100 days?

505
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:57,797
Why? Am I dying?

506
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,567
I'm just curious.

507
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:04,706
First, I want to buy a five-tier cake and eat it whole.

508
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:08,277
- What else? - I guess I'd go traveling.

509
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:10,377
What else?

510
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:12,377
What else?

511
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,416
I don't know. I never thought about it.

512
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:21,116
I thought about it just now, while our rice was being cooked.

513
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,197
I want to die after making you a success.

514
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:35,967
That's why I'll say this.

515
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:40,936
It'll be shocking, but don't be too shocked.

516
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:51,817
Quit publishing serially.

517
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:55,686
Not right away but within the month.

518
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:58,587
Consider it wrapping up your story short.

519
00:38:00,496 --> 00:38:02,357
It's all his fault.

520
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,366
Lee Hyun Kyu, the darn water ghost.

521
00:38:06,127 --> 00:38:09,067
Also, this isn't that big of a deal,

522
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,136
but it turned out that my boyfriend...

523
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,936
was a married man.

524
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:14,706
What?

525
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:16,907
He's insane!

526
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:19,407
You saw it for yourselves,

527
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:21,116
and you have brains to think with.

528
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:27,456
What do you think, Mr. Cha?

529
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,416
I have no thoughts.

530
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,956
Okay. Go on having no thoughts.

531
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,127
Jung Min?

532
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:36,897
Whatever the situation may be,

533
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,927
it's a fact it was an affair.

534
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:39,027
Would she do that?

535
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,697
You can never truly know someone.

536
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:42,866
The guy looked pretty loaded.

537
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:45,107
Would you like anyone with money?

538
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:47,206
Why don't you seduce our CEO, then?

539
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:48,476
What does that mean?

540
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:51,706
You seemed to envy her for dating a rich guy.

541
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:53,916
You're gutsy for saying that to his face.

542
00:38:54,677 --> 00:38:56,116
I suddenly feel sick.

543
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:58,016
I think we reached an agreement. Let's go.

544
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:00,456
We can't leave work on time, so let's try to do less overtime.

545
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:02,556
- I'm not yet... - You haven't agreed?

546
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:05,127
I have.

547
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:08,427
Guess what?

548
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,527
The cafe owner's dad owns this building.

549
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:12,527
- No way. - No way.

550
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:14,636
Welcome. Just a moment.

551
00:39:14,636 --> 00:39:16,366
- He must live in the penthouse. - Come by again.

552
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:18,407
I heard the landlord's son stays here to maintain the building.

553
00:39:18,737 --> 00:39:20,677
Then the yellow sports car in the basement parking...

554
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:22,536
must be his as well.

555
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:23,777
I heard it belongs to the landlord's son.

556
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:24,777
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

557
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,116
- Bye. - Take care.

558
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,357
Welcome back.

559
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:39,027
- I thought you quit. - You said no.

560
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:41,056
Why won't you go home, then?

561
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,627
I have some editing to do.

562
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:44,596
Why work hard if you're going to quit?

563
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:47,636
Will you do this for me, then?

564
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:49,397
Work hard.

565
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:51,837
What did Ms. Lee Hyun say?

566
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:54,837
She said yes.

567
00:39:54,837 --> 00:39:57,246
She knows better than anyone her work isn't that popular.

568
00:39:57,547 --> 00:39:59,476
What did you and Jijo talk about?

569
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:01,217
It's Jijo King, not just Jijo.

570
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:03,487
I can't bear saying his full name.

571
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,016
I criticized him a bit.

572
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:08,016
What's the occasion? You never criticize anyone.

573
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:09,357
Good for you.

574
00:40:09,686 --> 00:40:12,157
He wants a different editor. Someone pretty.

575
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:15,326
Does he think we edit with our looks? That's just stupid.

576
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:16,927
Pretty Jung Min can handle him.

577
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:19,427
- Am I pretty? - Yuck.

578
00:40:19,797 --> 00:40:21,897
Sorry. I have a weak stomach.

579
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,907
I said I'd edit his work. I'm the prettiest here.

580
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:27,507
Why did you date someone like that?

581
00:40:31,647 --> 00:40:33,516
I was working at a cafe...

582
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,547
and someone passing by almost spilled coffee on my laptop.

583
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:39,616
I'd almost finished editing about 80 episodes worth of a novel.

584
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:44,257
He suddenly showed up and shielded me with his body.

585
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:46,056
- He scored. - He scored.

586
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:47,297
He scored.

587
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:50,826
I said I'd pay for the dry-cleaning and he asked me out for coffee.

588
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:53,897
And you saw the rest.

589
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:55,636
I did. It must've been tough.

590
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:53,257
I can only fill this many pages.

591
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:58,826
In movies or dramas,

592
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:01,096
people who are about to die...

593
00:42:01,096 --> 00:42:03,806
leave everything behind just fine.

594
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:06,666
And think of a wish,

595
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,277
Tak Dong Kyung.

596
00:42:10,846 --> 00:42:14,177
I have no money to spend, dreams to achieve,

597
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,786
or love to work on.

598
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:21,686
If I had 10 years to live, I'd want money, dreams,

599
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:23,556
or even love,

600
00:42:24,286 --> 00:42:27,456
but I only have 100 days left.

601
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:29,527
Then someone else will die instead of you.

602
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:32,226
The person you love the most at that moment.

603
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:35,366
The life I'll live after that...

604
00:42:35,697 --> 00:42:39,107
is nothing short of doom.

605
00:42:40,837 --> 00:42:42,177
You wanted this world to end.

606
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:49,047
I'm exhausted.

607
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:53,857
Does everyone live like this?

608
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:57,956
Being harassed by both...

609
00:42:57,956 --> 00:42:59,786
life and death?

610
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:07,666
As if they're neither alive nor dead?

611
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:11,366
(5th Ward)

612
00:43:21,817 --> 00:43:24,346
- Ms. Kim, the defibrillator. - Okay.

613
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:41,866
Are you all right?

614
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:06,757
I don't think I'll see my 20th birthday in this lifetime.

615
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:12,297
What kind of deity is always sick to death or dead sad?

616
00:44:12,726 --> 00:44:15,837
Someone has to pay the price for this world to exist.

617
00:44:15,897 --> 00:44:17,866
Is the price tag this time a heart disease?

618
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:24,806
I think it's because people here call for the deity the most.

619
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:29,147
True. They called you to be born.

620
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:32,487
I opened my eyes the moment a lot of people called out for me.

621
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:35,717
So I will willingly pay the price.

622
00:44:36,956 --> 00:44:40,397
That is the job of a deity the people called upon and...

623
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:43,326
your job as the creation of a deity.

624
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:48,197
You already know that...

625
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:50,507
you cannot avoid your fate.

626
00:44:54,737 --> 00:44:57,007
She will not give up on the world.

627
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:58,377
Not like you did.

628
00:45:00,947 --> 00:45:03,016
I will make her give up on it.

629
00:45:03,116 --> 00:45:04,217
Will you?

630
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:07,686
Even if you do, will it be possible?

631
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:10,326
Humans created the deity. Of course they can bring doom to this world.

632
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:12,226
You and I both are humans' will.

633
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:14,427
Then I must do whatever it takes.

634
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:17,397
Because that's not all the humans want.

635
00:45:19,197 --> 00:45:21,596
You should go before midnight.

636
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:30,007
The deity is never ignorant.

637
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,507
We just pretend to be.

638
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:51,297
Are you ready?

639
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:52,996
One, two.

640
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:56,237
I'll take one more.

641
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:01,306
No. Smile brightly.

642
00:46:02,277 --> 00:46:03,476
Do you have a death wish?

643
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:06,476
- Pardon? - Why are you here?

644
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:08,717
Do you want another slap?

645
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:13,116
Is that how you usually apologize?

646
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:15,286
I don't feel sorry.

647
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:18,027
You can fight after I take your photo.

648
00:46:18,627 --> 00:46:20,127
Smile.

649
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:22,956
Smile. He wants you to.

650
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:35,677
Can you shave a little more off my chin?

651
00:46:35,677 --> 00:46:37,706
Then it won't be your face.

652
00:46:38,206 --> 00:46:40,916
- Does that matter? - It does.

653
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:43,416
ID photos are used to identify you.

654
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,547
This isn't for an ID.

655
00:46:48,357 --> 00:46:50,217
Print it out in that size.

656
00:46:50,217 --> 00:46:51,657
And frame it too.

657
00:46:52,087 --> 00:46:53,826
It's usually black, right?

658
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:58,527
Shall I make your eyes bigger too?

659
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,397
- Yes. - Then...

660
00:47:17,116 --> 00:47:19,587
Do you have to do this? A car would be more comfortable.

661
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,257
I won't ride your car.

662
00:47:21,357 --> 00:47:22,916
Who knows what'll happen?

663
00:47:23,857 --> 00:47:25,326
Then take a bus.

664
00:47:25,627 --> 00:47:28,927
Don't talk to me. I feel like walking in silence.

665
00:47:29,897 --> 00:47:31,666
You waste your time.

666
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,837
Shouldn't you be trying to spend every second well?

667
00:47:38,907 --> 00:47:41,507
You only look at me when I pick a fight.

668
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:48,047
Humans are really weird.

669
00:47:48,047 --> 00:47:49,717
Why make things like that?

670
00:47:49,717 --> 00:47:51,246
You never get to see them yourself.

671
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:53,916
It's for others, not me.

672
00:47:55,016 --> 00:47:56,786
I'm like that sometimes.

673
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:00,797
Then you decided to die.

674
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:04,467
Do things like you only care about yourselves?

675
00:48:08,496 --> 00:48:11,607
You have no idea how much I put others first.

676
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:13,266
Look at me now.

677
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,507
You slapped me, but I'm here to save you.

678
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:26,186
Time's ticking.

679
00:48:42,797 --> 00:48:44,907
Get used to it, if you want to walk with me.

680
00:48:47,036 --> 00:48:48,576
Did you do that?

681
00:48:51,877 --> 00:48:53,407
I didn't do it,

682
00:48:54,877 --> 00:48:56,476
but it is because of me.

683
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:09,697
(911 Ambulance)

684
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,627
Was that you too?

685
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:13,067
Sometimes.

686
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:17,206
(18 traffic accidents yesterday in Seoul, 2 dead, 8 injured)

687
00:49:18,366 --> 00:49:19,507
Yes.

688
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:25,447
How do you live like that?

689
00:49:26,746 --> 00:49:29,076
I don't live. I just exist.

690
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:34,257
I'm just a button of doom.

691
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:38,487
Every step I take, every move my hand makes,

692
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:41,197
every breath I take.

693
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:44,996
Everything about me leads to doom.

694
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:47,337
I exist for that.

695
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:53,306
And if you don't do anything?

696
00:49:54,907 --> 00:49:56,777
What if you don't do anything?

697
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:01,616
All hell breaks out on earth.

698
00:50:02,516 --> 00:50:05,746
Unusual temperatures persist and the cause is yet unknown.

699
00:50:05,746 --> 00:50:08,087
It's October, and all over the country,

700
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:09,357
heat waves and drought...

701
00:50:09,357 --> 00:50:11,326
This year's harvest is a disaster.

702
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:13,257
- There's no point. - I hate the world.

703
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:15,556
- It's crazy. - It's insane.

704
00:50:15,826 --> 00:50:18,596
- How can he kill his kid? - Why won't Mom just die?

705
00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:21,737
- You darn scumbag. - Why won't a deity kill him first?

706
00:50:27,436 --> 00:50:30,177
"If you gain something, you lose something."

707
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:34,976
"Everything you've gained in life were thanks to things you lost."

708
00:50:36,346 --> 00:50:38,616
I get what that means now.

709
00:50:40,016 --> 00:50:42,386
You need winter to have spring,

710
00:50:43,357 --> 00:50:45,556
and darkness to have light.

711
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:50,967
Death must exist for life. It's like that, isn't it?

712
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:56,297
So you are winter, darkness,

713
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:58,166
and death.

714
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:02,476
Yes.

715
00:51:02,536 --> 00:51:05,777
Like you said, you really do care for nothing but others.

716
00:51:07,346 --> 00:51:10,217
You just had to come to me when you cared only about yourself.

717
00:51:16,257 --> 00:51:18,326
How long must we hold hands for?

718
00:51:23,157 --> 00:51:25,366
I thought you held on because you liked it.

719
00:51:48,087 --> 00:51:50,857
Why follow me all the way here? It's too much pressure.

720
00:51:51,127 --> 00:51:52,826
But thanks anyway.

721
00:51:53,286 --> 00:51:56,627
You can go now. I won't run away again.

722
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:58,096
Shall we meet again tomorrow?

723
00:51:59,027 --> 00:52:00,996
- What? - Shall I come for you?

724
00:52:03,096 --> 00:52:04,206
It's up to you.

725
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:07,706
Why are you like this so suddenly?

726
00:52:08,036 --> 00:52:10,476
Why do I care whether you crawl in pain or not?

727
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:14,116
Do you have a mood disorder or something?

728
00:52:14,116 --> 00:52:15,616
Why do you suddenly change tune?

729
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:18,846
Hey, things were nice between us just now.

730
00:52:18,846 --> 00:52:22,217
We were beginning to understand and figure out each other.

731
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,587
I'm saying you should be more clingy.

732
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:26,686
To you?

733
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:28,357
To your fate that came to you.

734
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:42,407
Hey, Tak Dong Kyung.

735
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:49,177
Tak Dong Kyung.

736
00:52:49,877 --> 00:52:51,087
What do you want?

737
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:53,516
I don't see straight right now.

738
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:02,357
I was out of my mind, Dong Kyung.

739
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:06,427
I didn't mean what I said.

740
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:09,536
It shouldn't be past tense. You still are out of your mind.

741
00:53:09,536 --> 00:53:11,507
You have completely lost it!

742
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:14,737
We loved each other. We were in love!

743
00:53:15,036 --> 00:53:17,746
What I said at your work wasn't true. That was nonsense.

744
00:53:17,746 --> 00:53:20,206
This is how I truly feel. I'm drunk but honest.

745
00:53:20,306 --> 00:53:21,576
Yes, "Drunk Honesty".

746
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:23,177
I sang that song for you many times.

747
00:53:23,177 --> 00:53:24,386
Don't you remember?

748
00:53:25,116 --> 00:53:28,157
Let go of me. I said let go!

749
00:53:28,717 --> 00:53:31,587
If you're drunk, go home! Why did you come here?

750
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:37,627
Yes, I might be drunk

751
00:53:37,897 --> 00:53:41,837
This might be a mistake

752
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:45,436
Every morning

753
00:53:46,936 --> 00:53:49,706
Now I will confess

754
00:53:49,706 --> 00:53:53,007
I loved you from the start

755
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:55,516
Let go of me.

756
00:53:55,516 --> 00:53:57,016
Let go of me already.

757
00:53:57,147 --> 00:54:00,217
Get out of my life!

758
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:03,757
My awkward ramblings

759
00:54:03,757 --> 00:54:04,886
Darn you.

760
00:54:04,886 --> 00:54:07,627
- I may be crude - Let go!

761
00:54:07,627 --> 00:54:10,427
- I may not sound trustworthy - Oh, gosh. Let go!

762
00:54:12,297 --> 00:54:13,366
Who are you?

763
00:54:13,726 --> 00:54:16,996
Let go. Let go of me!

764
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:19,107
Was that a wish?

765
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,907
- What? - "Get out of my life."

766
00:54:22,407 --> 00:54:24,846
Are you crazy? Why would I waste my wish on him?

767
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:27,107
Will you let go of me?

768
00:54:27,246 --> 00:54:29,277
Then shall I get rid of him like this?

769
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:33,717
Honey.

770
00:54:37,056 --> 00:54:38,226
"Honey"?

771
00:54:38,226 --> 00:54:39,487
Your husband.

772
00:54:39,627 --> 00:54:41,697
"Honey"? Tak Dong Kyung, who is this jerk?

773
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:45,027
This must be the sicko you were talking about.

774
00:54:45,897 --> 00:54:48,266
Leave him to me. Go inside and have dinner.

775
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:50,766
I made cold cucumber soup, your favorite, sweetie.

776
00:54:51,536 --> 00:54:52,766
"Sweetie"?

777
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:55,476
Cold cucumber soup?

778
00:54:56,677 --> 00:54:57,947
Tak Dong Kyung.

779
00:54:58,377 --> 00:55:01,116
Were you seeing someone? Were you living with someone?

780
00:55:02,476 --> 00:55:04,076
This actually works much better.

781
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:07,487
I lied about being married and you that you live with a guy.

782
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:10,016
That makes us even. We can start over, can't we?

783
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:11,286
What are you lot doing?

784
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:18,797
What's going on?

785
00:55:18,927 --> 00:55:19,996
Hey.

786
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:23,197
It's not what you think. Don't.

787
00:55:23,197 --> 00:55:25,436
Who is married and who's she living with?

788
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:27,907
I'll whack the married one first.

789
00:55:28,777 --> 00:55:31,607
- No, wait, why... - Hey.

790
00:55:31,607 --> 00:55:33,576
- Hey. - What are you doing?

791
00:55:33,947 --> 00:55:35,846
- Come here! - Darn it.

792
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:11,186
Shoot.

793
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:19,556
It's hilarious.

794
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:24,266
Just dumbfounding.

795
00:56:28,366 --> 00:56:30,636
Leave it. I'll clean it up.

796
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:31,806
Thanks for help...

797
00:56:45,587 --> 00:56:47,346
I said I'd make it so you don't hurt.

798
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:55,127
I see why you thought of me.

799
00:56:57,157 --> 00:57:00,596
I wondered what kind of person would make that wish at that time.

800
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,706
I wasn't thinking of you.

801
00:57:05,237 --> 00:57:06,866
I am doom myself.

802
00:57:07,777 --> 00:57:11,206
You were the only person who had the same thought at the same time.

803
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:18,317
I'm grateful.

804
00:57:19,487 --> 00:57:20,647
In many ways.

805
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:40,936
Hey.

806
00:57:48,217 --> 00:57:49,476
This won't do.

807
00:57:53,047 --> 00:57:54,357
Let's live together.

808
00:57:55,686 --> 00:57:56,717
You and me.

809
00:59:05,456 --> 00:59:08,257
(Doom at Your Service)

810
00:59:08,527 --> 00:59:10,797
Why did I ask him to live with me?

811
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:11,927
Embarrassment lasts but just a second.

812
00:59:12,127 --> 00:59:14,027
- Hi, brother-in-law. - Hey.

813
00:59:14,996 --> 00:59:17,397
What are all these bottles? And this sofa?

814
00:59:17,397 --> 00:59:18,706
Where do I sleep?

815
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:20,306
Was that him?

816
00:59:20,907 --> 00:59:22,536
The one you love the most.

817
00:59:23,407 --> 00:59:26,377
Can't you change his fate?

818
00:59:26,947 --> 00:59:28,016
Give me your hand.

819
00:59:28,476 --> 00:59:29,647
I'm not human.

820
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:31,047
I feel no pity or love.

821
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:32,717
I don't have that kind of feeling.

822
00:59:32,717 --> 00:59:35,317
I do, because I'm human.

823
00:59:35,317 --> 00:59:38,627
So become the first human to love me.
