1
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:17,954
(Doom at Your Service)

2
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:21,024
(All characters, locations, organizations, religions,)

3
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:23,594
(and incidents in this drama are fictional.)

4
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:58,294
The deity is on my side.

5
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:02,133
Choose. Will you die here and now?

6
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:05,773
Or will you take my hand?

7
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:11,014
And the answer is...

8
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:13,083
Me.

9
00:02:36,963 --> 00:02:38,093
Don't let go.

10
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,974
Don't let go unless you want to die right now.

11
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:59,113
(Episode 2)

12
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,493
How is this possible?

13
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:04,754
All we did was go back in time.

14
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:07,924
- It's nothing that grand. - Not that.

15
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:11,333
Your...

16
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:13,963
How do I put it?

17
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,533
I'm searching for a term that won't sound rude.

18
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,303
- My identity? - Yes.

19
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:22,974
Are you suspicious or curious?

20
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:25,474
Neither. I'm simply being rational.

21
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:26,944
But you saw earlier.

22
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:28,683
You experienced it first hand. Accept it.

23
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:29,884
That's easier said than done.

24
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:32,053
- You're alive right now. - So?

25
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:34,854
It was Switzerland and then Italy outside your door.

26
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:36,653
So?

27
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,153
In your dream, on the subway, and at work.

28
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,324
Don't you remember?

29
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:43,394
I do remember. But it makes no sense.

30
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:46,004
I feel like I've gone insane.

31
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,374
Okay. Watch.

32
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:53,804
What?

33
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:58,173
- Oh my gosh. - Did the lights go out?

34
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,283
What's wrong with this?

35
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:03,884
What about this?

36
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:06,523
That's odd. What's going on?

37
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,694
A timely coincidence?

38
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:15,463
- What's going on? - My phone turned off.

39
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,764
- Why did it suddenly turn off? - It won't work.

40
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,333
Did the battery die?

41
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:24,004
A timely coincidence?

42
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:26,673
I see.

43
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:31,014
Are you an electric type?

44
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,554
- Look. - What's that in the sky?

45
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:44,324
Are they comets?

46
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:45,754
My gosh.

47
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:51,963
Comets out of the blue?

48
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,264
Okay. I get it, so stop.

49
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:56,903
Why? I didn't do that.

50
00:04:57,634 --> 00:04:59,273
I'm an electric type.

51
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:01,874
I said to stop it.

52
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:04,973
Stop it.

53
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,454
What's going on?

54
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:16,023
The power's back.

55
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,423
I'm not very nice.

56
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,864
My phone turned back on too.

57
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:22,934
That's with whom you entered into a contract.

58
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,434
Remember that I'm evil.

59
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:46,523
I need to stop fooling around, and go.

60
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,554
- All of a sudden? - Something annoying happened.

61
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:52,223
Consider that a show to commemorate our contract.

62
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:54,663
I hope you enjoy yourself.

63
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:11,913
You didn't want to hold it before. Now, you don't want to let go?

64
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:14,814
You said not to let go.

65
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:30,033
- What's this? - My promise.

66
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:32,093
I said I'd make sure you don't feel pain.

67
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,103
Don't relax too much.

68
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,973
You have to recharge it once a day before midnight.

69
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,773
Recharge it? How?

70
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,843
- By holding my hand. - What? Why?

71
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:48,114
In case you run away.

72
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,454
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyung.

73
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:01,494
Hey. How do you know my name?

74
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:02,494
Hey!

75
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:19,413
Excuse me.

76
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:21,283
Yes?

77
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:23,853
Do you remember the crosswalk earlier?

78
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:28,124
- You don't remember? - No, I don't.

79
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:31,653
I guess it really didn't happen.

80
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,594
You're such high maintenance.

81
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:20,474
I'll kill you in due time.

82
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:34,584
I said not to park your car in my spot,

83
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,793
but you keep trying.

84
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:39,254
Doom is my domain.

85
00:08:42,724 --> 00:08:43,964
Do something.

86
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:45,964
I keep hearing the voices.

87
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:50,673
I can't sleep. It's driving me crazy.

88
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:53,573
- Die. - You piece of trash.

89
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,543
- Stop. - Coward.

90
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:56,744
- Die. - He deserves to die.

91
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,014
Die, you murderer.

92
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,484
- Coward. - Die.

93
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,183
He should be ripped apart!

94
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,884
- Die! - Die.

95
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:04,913
How does it feel?

96
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:06,884
I deal with it every day.

97
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:09,754
Please kill me! I'm begging you!

98
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:14,224
Three of the people you stabbed died.

99
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:16,693
Two of them are still in a coma.

100
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,803
But you're alive and well. You should thank me.

101
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:22,563
That wasn't my plan.

102
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:25,403
It wasn't.

103
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:28,144
Life doesn't go as planned.

104
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,073
I'll stop here for today.

105
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:33,344
I got a good contract today, so I'm feeling chipper.

106
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,144
Who are you?

107
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,813
Have you ever heard this phrase?

108
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:42,153
"I am the first and the last, the beginning and the end."

109
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:49,423
I'm that. The last. The end.

110
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:58,004
Hey!

111
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:05,874
Why are you doing this to me? What do you want?

112
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:07,984
Doom.

113
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:16,023
(Jo Scum)

114
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,323
Why is he calling me?

115
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:33,773
Hey. I know you won't believe what I'm about to tell you,

116
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:36,173
but hear me out without giving me lip...

117
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,173
Hello?

118
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:39,474
Ji Na!

119
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:41,644
Ji Na!

120
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:43,754
What's wrong?

121
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:45,683
What is it? What's wrong?

122
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:47,584
I'm going to die.

123
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:50,854
- What? - I'm going to die!

124
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:53,023
Why?

125
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:57,734
Wait. Don't tell me...

126
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,033
I lost it all.

127
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:09,874
It's divine will.

128
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:13,183
My writing was garbage, so the powers at be deleted it.

129
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:18,014
They should've done it before I finished it.

130
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:19,724
What was with those comets?

131
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:21,354
What was with the power outage?

132
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:25,923
What else?

133
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,293
It's a sign that I should die.

134
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:34,433
Take care. Goodbye.

135
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:39,104
Why should you die?

136
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:40,874
This is all that jerk's fault.

137
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:45,573
That jerk?

138
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:48,884
Who? Bill Gates?

139
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:52,183
Just someone. Anyway.

140
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:53,953
Ji Na.

141
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:56,793
Sit down for now. Okay?

142
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:59,224
Stop acting like an amateur.

143
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:02,193
You know better than anyone what you must do in this situation.

144
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,094
No, I don't. Should I die?

145
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:10,604
There is only one solution, Ms. Na.

146
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,803
What?

147
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:14,673
Write it all again within an hour.

148
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:15,943
What? My suicide note?

149
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:17,874
The chapter.

150
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:19,813
The chapter?

151
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:23,214
I'm going to the roof.

152
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:25,014
Finish your chapter first.

153
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:26,683
What's the point though?

154
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:27,953
No one likes it.

155
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:31,094
They don't like it much at the company either, right?

156
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:34,124
What did they say? Be honest.

157
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:36,634
It's boring.

158
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:40,104
I don't think romance is her forte.

159
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:41,933
The male protagonist is too bland.

160
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,604
The number of reads keeps dropping.

161
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:46,173
But once readers have to pay to read a story,

162
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,604
the number drops to half on average...

163
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:51,214
Jung Min, would you go out with that male protagonist?

164
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:53,514
- Excuse me? - Not me.

165
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:55,844
I'll ask her to reduce the number of chapters...

166
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:57,084
and to end it sooner.

167
00:12:57,953 --> 00:12:59,923
Sure. Let's end this one.

168
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:01,854
Let's see how she does on her next story.

169
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:05,153
They said it's worth waiting and seeing.

170
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:08,063
Don't lie to me! The number of reads dropped to half.

171
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:11,094
Half the readers stop reading...

172
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,203
once they have to pay for the chapters.

173
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:16,834
That's true.

174
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:20,703
So let's just write, okay?

175
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:23,673
If you miss the upload time,

176
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:26,214
you'll lose the remaining half too.

177
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:27,783
Here.

178
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:32,283
Did you eat?

179
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:37,423
That's not real food.

180
00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:38,693
This is filling.

181
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:41,293
I have no time to write, let alone cook.

182
00:13:41,724 --> 00:13:43,334
This is much better than anything I cook...

183
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:44,563
in both taste and nutrition.

184
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,484
Ji Na...

185
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:12,153
Where do I even start?

186
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,494
What? Did you say something?

187
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,364
I'm going to run to the convenience store.

188
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:22,764
Okay.

189
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,313
Hello.

190
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:41,023
(Mr. Jung Dang Myun)

191
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:44,823
Hello, Mr. Jung. May I help you with something?

192
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:47,193
You're the one who needs help, Ms. Tak Dong Kyung.

193
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:51,533
Why are you full-naming me?

194
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:56,334
Was there an error with the upload?

195
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,433
Are you even scared?

196
00:14:57,803 --> 00:15:00,043
I'm calling as a doctor, not a writer.

197
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:02,644
I'm calling to threaten you.

198
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,744
I see. That.

199
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:08,584
You may feel fine now,

200
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,484
but it'll become so painful that you'll want to die.

201
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:12,114
This isn't a threat, it's a fact.

202
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:14,484
Will it keep getting worse?

203
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:16,453
Are you kidding me?

204
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:26,703
In other words, do I want to die after suffering tremendous pain...

205
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:31,073
or after suffering slightly milder than tremendous pain.

206
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:33,903
I have to choose one or the other, right?

207
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,043
I don't want either.

208
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:39,014
Don't think of doing anything rash.

209
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:40,943
Don't do that.

210
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:49,384
I already did something rash.

211
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:00,864
I don't regret it.

212
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,273
Doom is knocking at the door.

213
00:16:09,273 --> 00:16:10,773
Repent and be saved.

214
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,984
(The world is coming to an end.)

215
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,313
- It is? - Yes.

216
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:19,384
The countless evil deeds that we've committed...

217
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:20,823
angered the Almighty.

218
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:22,724
For example,

219
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:25,394
the comets today were proof that the end is near.

220
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:28,263
Doom is coming. It's knocking at our door.

221
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:30,634
(The world is coming to an end.)

222
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:34,564
You're right.

223
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:44,243
The Almighty is angry. Doom is drawing near.

224
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:54,923
Are you angry?

225
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:57,253
I'm feeling fine today.

226
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:58,794
Maybe you will be angry soon.

227
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:04,463
You said to become a human's wish.

228
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:08,134
But that human's wish happens to be doom.

229
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,834
- That's amusing. - Isn't it?

230
00:17:12,503 --> 00:17:15,074
Until now, humans only wished to win the lottery,

231
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:18,213
for their health or happiness, and things like that.

232
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:21,584
Do you know? If the garden is gone...

233
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,513
The gardener and the butterfly won't be needed anymore.

234
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:45,034
At least respond.

235
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:50,274
Do what you want. I plan to do what I want too.

236
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:56,483
Tell me this one thing.

237
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:00,384
Why me?

238
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:02,653
Who knows?

239
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:06,153
Fate?

240
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:11,663
That's cruel.

241
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,304
Fate is cruel to everyone.

242
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:27,183
You'll be punished if you do something bad.

243
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:33,753
I'm already being punished.

244
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:56,644
(Jo Scum)

245
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:58,874
You're screening my calls?

246
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:00,814
You'll regret it.

247
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:03,114
(You're screening my calls? You'll regret it.)

248
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:06,453
(You're screening my calls? You'll regret it.)

249
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:11,753
I said you'd regret it.

250
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:21,564
Ji Na, I need to rush back into the office.

251
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:23,473
Sorry. I'll buy dinner tomorrow.

252
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:24,473
What?

253
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:26,374
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

254
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:28,804
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

255
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:32,144
Tak Dong Kyung, who works here,

256
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:33,943
is a homewrecker.

257
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:36,913
She seduced me, a well-behaved, happily married man!

258
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:37,913
Seduced?

259
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:39,854
That doesn't belong in the same sentence as "Do Kyung".

260
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:41,653
The naive man that I am, I fell for it.

261
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:42,653
Naive?

262
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:45,653
And I ended up losing my precious wife!

263
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:47,193
How could this happen?

264
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:50,263
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

265
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:52,394
Excuse me. You can't do this in our office.

266
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:54,703
- Get out. - I'm angry, that's why.

267
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:55,703
Get out.

268
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,973
Tak Dong Kyung must repent!

269
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,003
Let's talk outside.

270
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,003
You are just incredible.

271
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:05,973
How can you eat after ruining my life?

272
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,814
I said let's talk outside.

273
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:09,084
Forget it.

274
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:12,013
What did you say to my wife?

275
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,683
What did you say that she wants a divorce?

276
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:21,894
"I didn't know he was married."

277
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:23,733
"I was deceived."

278
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,794
"I did nothing wrong."

279
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,804
"He's the one who was wrong."

280
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:30,874
That's what I said. So?

281
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:33,433
I am dumbfounded.

282
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:37,074
Hey. It wasn't love for me.

283
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:38,713
How do I put it?

284
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:41,114
It just happened.

285
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:44,614
Even if we end it, we should have manners!

286
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:45,913
Manners?

287
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:47,753
You're talking about manners?

288
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:49,753
That's right! Manners! M-A-N-E-R!

289
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,153
M-A-N-N-E-R.

290
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:55,024
To be honest, what do you have to offer?

291
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:56,493
You don't have anything everyone else has.

292
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:59,263
You have no parents or money. What do you have?

293
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,574
And think of a wish, Tak Dong Kyung.

294
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:11,013
Should I make that wish right now?

295
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:12,574
What?

296
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,384
Forget it.

297
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:18,584
It'll be too much of a waste to use it on the likes of you.

298
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:21,923
Is this the time?

299
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:24,423
Is this the time for what?

300
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:26,223
Doom.

301
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:28,294
What are you babbling about?

302
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:30,263
I'm saying I want to kill you.

303
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:36,903
You can tell when someone grew up with no parents...

304
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:38,233
in these situations.

305
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:39,774
This is why...

306
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:41,544
I won't let my child grow up without a dad!

307
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:42,604
Excuse me!

308
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,374
Excuse me. From what I can see,

309
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:46,874
you're the highest up here.

310
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,814
It's extremely bad for the company image...

311
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:50,584
to have an employee like her.

312
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:53,453
So... Wait. Hold on.

313
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:55,854
Darn it.

314
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:58,854
Don't let outsiders in so easily.

315
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:08,364
Is everyone okay?

316
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:10,433
I think the lunch gave me indigestion.

317
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:14,544
Fire the homewrecker...

318
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:16,374
Tak Dong Kyung! Fire her!

319
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:19,213
- I'm this nitwit's wife. - What...

320
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,013
- Everything he says is a lie. - Honey.

321
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:22,683
- Sorry for the trouble. - Wait.

322
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:25,013
I was about to leave. You have the wrong idea.

323
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:26,213
- Hey. - Let's go.

324
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,923
Honey, the baby. Be careful of the baby.

325
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:30,284
Hey, you, Dong Kyung!

326
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:32,223
Hold on. Honey!

327
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:34,524
I'll kill you!

328
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:36,763
- Darn it. - Shut it!

329
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:41,263
Wow. Gosh.

330
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:32,384
("Life" group chat)

331
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:34,423
(I'm staring at the clock. I'm getting coffee.)

332
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:37,294
Big news. You'll never guess what happened in our office.

333
00:23:39,723 --> 00:23:42,663
If I hear anyone typing, I will kill you.

334
00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:49,503
Hey!

335
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:53,173
It wasn't me.

336
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:14,824
(Resignation)

337
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:18,794
I'll resign.

338
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:21,163
I don't have the authority.

339
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,604
Mr. Park isn't in right now.

340
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:25,534
Please submit it for me.

341
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:26,634
I can't be bothered.

342
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:29,604
And it isn't business hours yet.

343
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:34,243
- When will Mr. Park be back? - I don't know.

344
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:36,044
Excuse me?

345
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:39,854
He went to Bali with his girlfriend to celebrate making up.

346
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:51,233
Bali to make it up to my queen.

347
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:53,094
A man in charge of a company.

348
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:58,003
However, for tonight, a man who exists for one woman.

349
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:00,104
Looking good, sir.

350
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,473
Enjoy your vacation.

351
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:04,874
Enjoy a long vacation, sir.

352
00:25:06,644 --> 00:25:10,044
(Like)

353
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:35,003
Recharge.

354
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:39,413
Why couldn't you cross the street?

355
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:42,943
- I was too scared. - Then you should've called me.

356
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:45,084
- How? - However.

357
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:46,784
You sound like you're on my side.

358
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:48,824
That's all in your head.

359
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:50,723
How was your day?

360
00:25:51,193 --> 00:25:52,824
Why are you asking that?

361
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:54,324
Who knows?

362
00:25:54,324 --> 00:25:56,223
You may want to bring doom today.

363
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:58,094
That will make things easier.

364
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:01,763
I have a question.

365
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:05,074
What happens if I break this contract?

366
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:08,344
If you break it?

367
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:11,144
What if I don't feel pain until I die and get my wish,

368
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:13,884
but I die without asking you to end this world?

369
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:20,854
Will you do that?

370
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:29,493
Then someone else will die instead of you.

371
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:32,294
The person you love the most at that moment.

372
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:36,804
What? What do you...

373
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:39,473
I'll remove the doom from here to there.

374
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:42,403
It's simple.

375
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:44,743
That's not what you promised.

376
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:46,413
I made no promise.

377
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:48,213
All contracts have penalties for breaches.

378
00:26:49,513 --> 00:26:52,084
I don't know. Regardless, you've entered into a contract.

379
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:53,284
It's a done deal.

380
00:26:57,753 --> 00:26:58,854
You fraud.

381
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:04,433
Would it have been different if you had known?

382
00:27:11,374 --> 00:27:12,374
I doubt that.

383
00:27:28,024 --> 00:27:29,723
Okay. I'll be fair.

384
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:31,923
I'll give you another chance to choose.

385
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:33,054
What will you do now?

386
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:38,963
Choose quickly. You'll die at that rate.

387
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:39,963
Hey.

388
00:27:39,963 --> 00:27:41,804
When you gain something, you must lose something.

389
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:43,034
Think hard.

390
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:46,003
Everything you've gained in life were thanks to things you lost.

391
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:47,804
Why?

392
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,144
Why me?

393
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:53,074
Why? Why must it be me?

394
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:01,183
Fate.

395
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:07,423
That's cruel.

396
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,433
Fate is cruel to everyone.

397
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:27,344
Stop! Stop it!

398
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:46,094
See?

399
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:54,844
Scumbag.

400
00:28:57,774 --> 00:28:59,443
I've heard that so much.

401
00:29:00,144 --> 00:29:02,044
Is it fun toying with me?

402
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:05,413
Like I said, I'm not on your side.

403
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:07,824
It was your choice.

404
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:11,524
And naturally, I will always respect your decision.

405
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,433
Will you keep standing here?

406
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:22,733
Fine, suit yourself. I'm going to cross.

407
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:24,973
It's getting boring.

408
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:56,163
Why?

409
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:01,243
Why me?

410
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:04,213
Why? Why must it be me?

411
00:30:05,544 --> 00:30:06,713
Why me?

412
00:30:08,884 --> 00:30:09,913
Fate?

413
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:12,814
That's cruel.

414
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:37,774
Dong Kyung!

415
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:39,743
I got your favourite rice cake.

416
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:42,644
Look. I bought a lot.

417
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:47,683
Then someone else will die instead of you.

418
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:50,324
The person you love the most at that moment.

419
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:57,794
What's wrong?

420
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:02,763
I took care of the insurance matter.

421
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:04,673
It turned out...

422
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:07,743
the owner of the rental car company was my classmate's brother's...

423
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:10,544
distant aunt's fourth cousin...

424
00:31:12,374 --> 00:31:15,114
Anyway, it was someone I knew so I got it resolved.

425
00:31:15,114 --> 00:31:16,144
It's true!

426
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:21,423
What's wrong?

427
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,854
Were you drinking?

428
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,963
Did you come up with a new way to kill me?

429
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:30,864
Dong Kyung.

430
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,973
Excuse me. One roll of gimbap please.

431
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:20,013
Okay.

432
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:23,943
That's a dollar. Thank you.

433
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,854
I'm so angry.

434
00:32:27,683 --> 00:32:30,753
The most important thing is to keep them wanting more.

435
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:32,394
You have to play hard to get.

436
00:32:32,923 --> 00:32:36,294
That way, the readers will wonder what happens to the characters...

437
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:38,634
and will drool and follow us.

438
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:40,534
Know what I mean?

439
00:32:40,663 --> 00:32:44,374
It should be like a skirt that you can almost look up.

440
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:48,604
A shirt?

441
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:53,344
Does the author Lee Hyun not go to the office much?

442
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:55,344
Pardon?

443
00:32:57,884 --> 00:32:59,983
I hear she's really pretty.

444
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,124
I hear you two are close.

445
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,753
Let me meet her.

446
00:33:03,753 --> 00:33:04,753
Who knows?

447
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:06,624
Writers get each other.

448
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:08,124
If we hit it off,

449
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:09,223
we may...

450
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:11,193
You know.

451
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:15,134
People need to know their place.

452
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:17,463
What?

453
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:22,173
Him.

454
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:23,503
This wrinkly old man...

455
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,274
doesn't know his place and does what he does.

456
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:27,473
Did you do that on purpose?

457
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:28,843
Does he die later on?

458
00:33:31,314 --> 00:33:34,453
That has nothing to do with social perspective.

459
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:37,484
It's a set-up to accentuate a truly pure, innocent love.

460
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:39,453
That's the kind of jerk...

461
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:42,464
that lies about his marital status to lure an ordinary single woman.

462
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:43,863
What?

463
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:47,464
Why does social perspective have nothing to do with love?

464
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:49,834
Love that goes beyond social perspective is a crime.

465
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:51,973
Is he a criminal?

466
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:54,573
Ms. Tak. How can you say that?

467
00:33:55,104 --> 00:33:56,174
What's wrong?

468
00:33:56,504 --> 00:33:59,573
I'm in awe because your writing is so realistic.

469
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:03,343
You weren't like this.

470
00:34:04,314 --> 00:34:06,484
People who suddenly change die soon.

471
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:08,283
Is this because I asked about Lee Hyun?

472
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:11,553
No. It's because my time's almost up.

473
00:34:12,453 --> 00:34:15,763
I'm already wondering if it's today or tomorrow.

474
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,964
What? Where are you going when we're still talking?

475
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:21,033
I'm off to see the pretty Lee Hyun.

476
00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:33,874
- It's because of a man. - A man?

477
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:37,144
What man? I don't even know a male insect.

478
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:39,183
Think carefully.

479
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:41,584
He's very close to water.

480
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:42,723
Water?

481
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:47,493
He's standing right in your way.

482
00:34:47,624 --> 00:34:50,723
You're being dragged down by a ghost that drowned!

483
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:56,464
You can't change your pen name now.

484
00:34:56,464 --> 00:34:58,904
The fortune-teller told me to get rid of everything about him.

485
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:01,544
- Thanks. I'll enjoy the food. - Sure.

486
00:35:01,774 --> 00:35:04,104
Why did I take his name as my pen name?

487
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:06,214
And why did he have to swim?

488
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:08,183
It's really chilling.

489
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:09,944
How did she know about water?

490
00:35:10,113 --> 00:35:11,754
Ji Na, who is this fortune-teller?

491
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,924
Why? Is something not working out?

492
00:35:15,183 --> 00:35:17,323
Work's a problem.

493
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:18,823
Will you change jobs?

494
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:20,723
Do it. If you don't like it, jump ship.

495
00:35:20,723 --> 00:35:22,294
There are many other publishers.

496
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:24,834
I don't exactly want to jump ship.

497
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:29,604
- Tak. - What?

498
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:33,674
Should I...

499
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:36,303
quit writing?

500
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,044
Ji Na!

501
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:39,674
I'll cook the rice for you.

502
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,203
You can eat once the cheese melts.

503
00:36:06,674 --> 00:36:07,774
Ji Na.

504
00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:11,144
What do you want to do if you die in 100 days?

505
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:12,544
Why? Am I dying?

506
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:15,314
I'm just curious.

507
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:19,453
First, I want to buy a five-tier cake and eat it whole.

508
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:23,024
- What else? - I guess I'd go travelling.

509
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:25,124
What else?

510
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:27,124
What else?

511
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:30,163
I don't know. I never thought about it.

512
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:35,863
I thought about it just now, while our rice was being cooked.

513
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:41,944
I want to die after making you a success.

514
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:50,714
That's why I'll say this.

515
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:55,683
It'll be shocking, but don't be too shocked.

516
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:06,564
Quit publishing serially.

517
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:10,433
Not right away but within the month.

518
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:13,334
Consider it wrapping up your story short.

519
00:37:15,243 --> 00:37:17,104
It's all his fault.

520
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:20,113
Lee Hyun Kyu, the darn water ghost.

521
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:23,814
Also, this isn't that big of a deal,

522
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:25,883
but it turned out that my boyfriend...

523
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:27,683
was a married man.

524
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:29,453
What?

525
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,654
He's insane!

526
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:34,154
You saw it for yourselves,

527
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:35,863
and you have brains to think with.

528
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,203
What do you think, Mr. Cha?

529
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:44,163
I have no thoughts.

530
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:46,703
Okay. Go on having no thoughts.

531
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:47,874
Jung Min?

532
00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:51,644
Whatever the situation may be,

533
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,674
it's a fact it was an affair.

534
00:37:52,674 --> 00:37:53,774
Would she do that?

535
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,444
You can never truly know someone.

536
00:37:55,444 --> 00:37:57,613
The guy looked pretty loaded.

537
00:37:57,953 --> 00:37:59,854
Would you like anyone with money?

538
00:37:59,854 --> 00:38:01,953
Why don't you seduce our CEO, then?

539
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:03,223
What does that mean?

540
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:06,453
You seemed to envy her for dating a rich guy.

541
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:08,663
You're gutsy for saying that to his face.

542
00:38:09,424 --> 00:38:10,863
I suddenly feel sick.

543
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:12,763
I think we reached an agreement. Let's go.

544
00:38:12,763 --> 00:38:15,203
We can't leave work on time, so let's try to do less overtime.

545
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:17,303
- I'm not yet... - You haven't agreed?

546
00:38:18,803 --> 00:38:19,874
I have.

547
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:23,174
Guess what?

548
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,274
The café owner's dad owns this building.

549
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:27,274
- No way. - No way.

550
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:29,383
Welcome. Just a moment.

551
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:31,113
- He must live in the penthouse. - Come by again.

552
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:33,154
I heard the landlord's son stays here to maintain the building.

553
00:38:33,484 --> 00:38:35,424
Then the yellow sports car in the basement parking...

554
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:37,283
must be his as well.

555
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:38,524
I heard it belongs to the landlord's son.

556
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,524
(Lee Hyun Kyu)

557
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:43,863
- Bye. - Take care.

558
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:48,104
Welcome back.

559
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,774
- I thought you quit. - You said no.

560
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:55,803
Why won't you go home, then?

561
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:57,374
I have some editing to do.

562
00:38:57,374 --> 00:38:59,343
Why work hard if you're going to quit?

563
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:02,383
Will you do this for me, then?

564
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:04,144
Work hard.

565
00:39:05,183 --> 00:39:06,584
What did Ms. Lee Hyun say?

566
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,584
She said yes.

567
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:11,993
She knows better than anyone her work isn't that popular.

568
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:14,223
What did you and Jijo talk about?

569
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:15,964
It's Jijo King, not just Jijo.

570
00:39:15,964 --> 00:39:18,234
I can't bear saying his full name.

571
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,763
I criticized him a bit.

572
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:22,763
What's the occasion? You never criticize anyone.

573
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:24,104
Good for you.

574
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:26,904
He wants a different editor. Someone pretty.

575
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:30,073
Does he think we edit with our looks? That's just stupid.

576
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:31,674
Pretty Jung Min can handle him.

577
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:34,174
- Am I pretty? - Yuck.

578
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:36,644
Sorry. I have a weak stomach.

579
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,654
I said I'd edit his work. I'm the prettiest here.

580
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:42,254
Why did you date someone like that?

581
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:48,263
I was working at a café...

582
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:51,294
and someone passing by almost spilled coffee on my laptop.

583
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:54,363
I'd almost finished editing about 80 episodes worth of a novel.

584
00:39:55,504 --> 00:39:59,004
He suddenly showed up and shielded me with his body.

585
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:00,803
- He scored. - He scored.

586
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:02,044
He scored.

587
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:05,573
I said I'd pay for the dry-cleaning and he asked me out for coffee.

588
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:08,644
And you saw the rest.

589
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:10,383
I did. It must've been tough.

590
00:41:04,263 --> 00:41:08,004
I can only fill this many pages.

591
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:13,573
In movies or dramas,

592
00:41:13,573 --> 00:41:15,843
people who are about to die...

593
00:41:15,843 --> 00:41:18,553
leave everything behind just fine.

594
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:21,413
And think of a wish,

595
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,024
Tak Dong Kyung.

596
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:28,924
I have no money to spend, dreams to achieve,

597
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:31,533
or love to work on.

598
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:36,433
If I had 10 years to live, I'd want money, dreams,

599
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:38,303
or even love,

600
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:42,203
but I only have 100 days left.

601
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:44,274
Then someone else will die instead of you.

602
00:41:44,874 --> 00:41:46,973
The person you love the most at that moment.

603
00:41:48,144 --> 00:41:50,113
The life I'll live after that...

604
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:53,854
is nothing short of doom.

605
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:56,924
You wanted this world to end.

606
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:03,794
I'm exhausted.

607
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:08,604
Does everyone live like this?

608
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:12,703
Being harassed by both...

609
00:42:12,703 --> 00:42:14,533
life and death?

610
00:42:17,544 --> 00:42:22,413
As if they're neither alive nor dead?

611
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:26,113
(5th Ward)

612
00:42:36,564 --> 00:42:39,093
- Ms. Kim, the defibrillator. - Okay.

613
00:42:54,843 --> 00:42:56,613
Are you all right?

614
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:21,504
I don't think I'll see my 20th birthday in this lifetime.

615
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:27,044
What kind of deity is always sick to death or dead sad?

616
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:30,584
Someone has to pay the price for this world to exist.

617
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:32,613
Is the price tag this time a heart disease?

618
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:39,553
I think it's because people here call for the deity the most.

619
00:43:40,553 --> 00:43:43,894
True. They called you to be born.

620
00:43:43,964 --> 00:43:47,234
I opened my eyes the moment a lot of people called out for me.

621
00:43:47,964 --> 00:43:50,464
So I will willingly pay the price.

622
00:43:51,703 --> 00:43:55,144
That is the job of a deity the people called upon and...

623
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:58,073
your job as the creation of a deity.

624
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:02,944
You already know that...

625
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:05,254
you cannot avoid your fate.

626
00:44:09,484 --> 00:44:11,754
She will not give up on the world.

627
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:13,124
Not like you did.

628
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,763
I will make her give up on it.

629
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:18,964
Will you?

630
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:22,433
Even if you do, will it be possible?

631
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:25,073
Humans created the deity. Of course they can bring doom to this world.

632
00:44:25,073 --> 00:44:26,973
You and I both are humans' will.

633
00:44:26,973 --> 00:44:29,174
Then I must do whatever it takes.

634
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:32,144
Because that's not all the humans want.

635
00:44:33,944 --> 00:44:36,343
You should go before midnight.

636
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:44,754
The deity is never ignorant.

637
00:44:44,854 --> 00:44:47,254
We just pretend to be.

638
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:06,044
Are you ready?

639
00:45:06,044 --> 00:45:07,743
One, two.

640
00:45:09,314 --> 00:45:10,984
I'll take one more.

641
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:16,053
No. Smile brightly.

642
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:18,223
Do you have a death wish?

643
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:21,223
- Pardon? - Why are you here?

644
00:45:21,424 --> 00:45:23,464
Do you want another slap?

645
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:27,863
Is that how you usually apologize?

646
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,033
I don't feel sorry.

647
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:32,774
You can fight after I take your photo.

648
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:34,874
Smile.

649
00:45:35,544 --> 00:45:37,703
Smile. He wants you to.

650
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:50,424
Can you shave a little more off my chin?

651
00:45:50,424 --> 00:45:52,453
Then it won't be your face.

652
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:55,663
- Does that matter? - It does.

653
00:45:55,663 --> 00:45:58,163
ID photos are used to identify you.

654
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:01,294
This isn't for an ID.

655
00:46:03,104 --> 00:46:04,964
Print it out in that size.

656
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:06,404
And frame it too.

657
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:08,573
It's usually black, right?

658
00:46:09,874 --> 00:46:13,274
Shall I make your eyes bigger too?

659
00:46:13,913 --> 00:46:15,144
- Yes. - Then...

660
00:46:31,863 --> 00:46:34,334
Do you have to do this? A car would be more comfortable.

661
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:36,004
I won't ride your car.

662
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:37,663
Who knows what'll happen?

663
00:46:38,604 --> 00:46:40,073
Then take a bus.

664
00:46:40,374 --> 00:46:43,674
Don't talk to me. I feel like walking in silence.

665
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:46,413
You waste your time.

666
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:48,584
Shouldn't you be trying to spend every second well?

667
00:46:53,654 --> 00:46:56,254
You only look at me when I pick a fight.

668
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:02,794
Humans are really weird.

669
00:47:02,794 --> 00:47:04,464
Why make things like that?

670
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:05,993
You never get to see them yourself.

671
00:47:06,394 --> 00:47:08,663
It's for others, not me.

672
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:11,533
I'm like that sometimes.

673
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,544
Then you decided to die.

674
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:19,214
Do things like you only care about yourselves?

675
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:26,354
You have no idea how much I put others first.

676
00:47:26,984 --> 00:47:28,013
Look at me now.

677
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:30,254
You slapped me, but I'm here to save you.

678
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:40,933
Time's ticking.

679
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:59,654
Get used to it, if you want to walk with me.

680
00:48:01,783 --> 00:48:03,323
Did you do that?

681
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:08,154
I didn't do it,

682
00:48:09,624 --> 00:48:11,223
but it is because of me.

683
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:24,444
(911 Ambulance)

684
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,374
Was that you too?

685
00:48:26,774 --> 00:48:27,814
Sometimes.

686
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:31,953
(18 traffic accidents yesterday in Seoul, 2 dead, 8 injured)

687
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:34,254
Yes.

688
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:40,194
How do you live like that?

689
00:48:41,493 --> 00:48:43,823
I don't live. I just exist.

690
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:49,004
I'm just a button of doom.

691
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:53,234
Every step I take, every move my hand makes,

692
00:48:54,573 --> 00:48:55,944
every breath I take.

693
00:48:57,544 --> 00:48:59,743
Everything about me leads to doom.

694
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:02,084
I exist for that.

695
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,053
And if you don't do anything?

696
00:49:09,654 --> 00:49:11,524
What if you don't do anything?

697
00:49:13,794 --> 00:49:16,363
All hell breaks out on earth.

698
00:49:17,263 --> 00:49:20,493
Unusual temperatures persist and the cause is yet unknown.

699
00:49:20,493 --> 00:49:22,834
It's October, and all over the country,

700
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,104
heat waves and drought...

701
00:49:24,104 --> 00:49:26,073
This year's harvest is a disaster.

702
00:49:26,073 --> 00:49:28,004
- There's no point. - I hate the world.

703
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:30,303
- It's crazy. - It's insane.

704
00:49:30,573 --> 00:49:33,343
- How can he kill his kid? - Why won't Mom just die?

705
00:49:33,343 --> 00:49:36,484
- You darn scumbag. - Why won't a deity kill him first?

706
00:49:42,183 --> 00:49:44,924
"If you gain something, you lose something."

707
00:49:45,354 --> 00:49:49,723
"Everything you've gained in life were thanks to things you lost."

708
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:53,363
I get what that means now.

709
00:49:54,763 --> 00:49:57,133
You need winter to have spring,

710
00:49:58,104 --> 00:50:00,303
and darkness to have light.

711
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:05,714
Death must exist for life. It's like that, isn't it?

712
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:11,044
So you are winter, darkness,

713
00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:12,913
and death.

714
00:50:16,154 --> 00:50:17,223
Yes.

715
00:50:17,283 --> 00:50:20,524
Like you said, you really do care for nothing but others.

716
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:24,964
You just had to come to me when you cared only about yourself.

717
00:50:31,004 --> 00:50:33,073
How long must we hold hands for?

718
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:40,113
I thought you held on because you liked it.

719
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:05,604
Why follow me all the way here? It's too much pressure.

720
00:51:05,874 --> 00:51:07,573
But thanks anyway.

721
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:11,374
You can go now. I won't run away again.

722
00:51:11,674 --> 00:51:12,843
Shall we meet again tomorrow?

723
00:51:13,774 --> 00:51:15,743
- What? - Shall I come for you?

724
00:51:17,843 --> 00:51:18,953
It's up to you.

725
00:51:20,413 --> 00:51:22,453
Why are you like this so suddenly?

726
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:25,223
Why do I care whether you crawl in pain or not?

727
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:28,863
Do you have a mood disorder or something?

728
00:51:28,863 --> 00:51:30,363
Why do you suddenly change tune?

729
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:33,593
Hey, things were nice between us just now.

730
00:51:33,593 --> 00:51:36,964
We were beginning to understand and figure out each other.

731
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,334
I'm saying you should be more clingy.

732
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,433
To you?

733
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:43,104
To your fate that came to you.

734
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:57,154
Hey, Tak Dong Kyung.

735
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:03,924
Tak Dong Kyung.

736
00:52:04,624 --> 00:52:05,834
What do you want?

737
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:08,263
I don't see straight right now.

738
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:17,104
I was out of my mind, Dong Kyung.

739
00:52:18,444 --> 00:52:21,174
I didn't mean what I said.

740
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:24,283
It shouldn't be past tense. You still are out of your mind.

741
00:52:24,283 --> 00:52:26,254
You have completely lost it!

742
00:52:26,254 --> 00:52:29,484
We loved each other. We were in love!

743
00:52:29,783 --> 00:52:32,493
What I said at your work wasn't true. That was nonsense.

744
00:52:32,493 --> 00:52:34,953
This is how I truly feel. I'm drunk but honest.

745
00:52:35,053 --> 00:52:36,323
Yes, "Drunk Honesty".

746
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:37,924
I sang that song for you many times.

747
00:52:37,924 --> 00:52:39,133
Don't you remember?

748
00:52:39,863 --> 00:52:42,904
Let go of me. I said let go!

749
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:46,334
If you're drunk, go home! Why did you come here?

750
00:52:46,334 --> 00:52:52,374
Yes, I might be drunk

751
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:56,584
This might be a mistake

752
00:52:57,113 --> 00:53:00,183
Every morning

753
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:04,453
Now I will confess

754
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:07,754
I loved you from the start

755
00:53:07,754 --> 00:53:10,263
Let go of me.

756
00:53:10,263 --> 00:53:11,763
Let go of me already.

757
00:53:11,894 --> 00:53:14,964
Get out of my life!

758
00:53:15,363 --> 00:53:18,504
My awkward ramblings

759
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:19,633
Darn you.

760
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:22,374
- I may be crude - Let go!

761
00:53:22,374 --> 00:53:25,174
- I may not sound trustworthy - Oh, gosh. Let go!

762
00:53:27,044 --> 00:53:28,113
Who are you?

763
00:53:28,473 --> 00:53:31,743
Let go. Let go of me!

764
00:53:32,683 --> 00:53:33,854
Was that a wish?

765
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:36,654
- What? - "Get out of my life."

766
00:53:37,154 --> 00:53:39,593
Are you crazy? Why would I waste my wish on him?

767
00:53:39,794 --> 00:53:41,854
Will you let go of me?

768
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:44,024
Then shall I get rid of him like this?

769
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:48,464
Honey.

770
00:53:51,803 --> 00:53:52,973
"Honey"?

771
00:53:52,973 --> 00:53:54,234
Your husband.

772
00:53:54,374 --> 00:53:56,444
"Honey"? Tak Dong Kyung, who is this jerk?

773
00:53:56,444 --> 00:53:59,774
This must be the sicko you were talking about.

774
00:54:00,644 --> 00:54:03,013
Leave him to me. Go inside and have dinner.

775
00:54:03,513 --> 00:54:05,513
I made cold cucumber soup, your favourite, sweetie.

776
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:07,513
"Sweetie"?

777
00:54:08,714 --> 00:54:10,223
Cold cucumber soup?

778
00:54:11,424 --> 00:54:12,694
Tak Dong Kyung.

779
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,863
Were you seeing someone? Were you living with someone?

780
00:54:17,223 --> 00:54:18,823
This actually works much better.

781
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:22,234
I lied about being married and you that you live with a guy.

782
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:24,763
That makes us even. We can start over, can't we?

783
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:26,033
What are you lot doing?

784
00:54:32,473 --> 00:54:33,544
What's going on?

785
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:34,743
Hey.

786
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:37,944
It's not what you think. Don't.

787
00:54:37,944 --> 00:54:40,183
Who is married and who's she living with?

788
00:54:40,883 --> 00:54:42,654
I'll whack the married one first.

789
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:46,354
- No, wait, why... - Hey.

790
00:54:46,354 --> 00:54:48,323
- Hey. - What are you doing?

791
00:54:48,694 --> 00:54:50,593
- Come here! - Darn it.

792
00:55:24,723 --> 00:55:25,933
Shoot.

793
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:34,303
It's hilarious.

794
00:55:37,604 --> 00:55:39,013
Just dumbfounding.

795
00:55:43,113 --> 00:55:45,383
Leave it. I'll clean it up.

796
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:46,553
Thanks for help...

797
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:02,093
I said I'd make it so you don't hurt.

798
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:09,874
I see why you thought of me.

799
00:56:11,904 --> 00:56:15,343
I wondered what kind of person would make that wish at that time.

800
00:56:17,644 --> 00:56:19,453
I wasn't thinking of you.

801
00:56:19,984 --> 00:56:21,613
I am doom myself.

802
00:56:22,524 --> 00:56:25,953
You were the only person who had the same thought at the same time.

803
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:33,064
I'm grateful.

804
00:56:34,234 --> 00:56:35,394
In many ways.

805
00:56:54,613 --> 00:56:55,683
Hey.

806
00:57:02,964 --> 00:57:04,223
This won't do.

807
00:57:07,794 --> 00:57:09,104
Let's live together.

808
00:57:10,433 --> 00:57:11,464
You and me.

809
00:58:20,203 --> 00:58:23,004
(Doom at Your Service)

810
00:58:23,274 --> 00:58:25,544
Why did I ask him to live with me?

811
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,674
Embarrassment lasts but just a second.

812
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:28,774
- Hi, brother-in-law. - Hey.

813
00:58:29,743 --> 00:58:32,144
What are all these bottles? And this sofa?

814
00:58:32,144 --> 00:58:33,453
Where do I sleep?

815
00:58:33,953 --> 00:58:35,053
Was that him?

816
00:58:35,654 --> 00:58:37,283
The one you love the most.

817
00:58:38,154 --> 00:58:41,124
Can't you change his fate?

818
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:42,763
Give me your hand.

819
00:58:43,223 --> 00:58:44,394
I'm not human.

820
00:58:44,593 --> 00:58:45,794
I feel no pity or love.

821
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:47,464
I don't have that kind of feeling.

822
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:50,064
I do, because I'm human.

823
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:53,374
So become the first human to love me.
