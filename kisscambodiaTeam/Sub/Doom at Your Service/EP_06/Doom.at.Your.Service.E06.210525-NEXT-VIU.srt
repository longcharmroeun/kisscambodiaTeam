00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,935
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:29,439
Love me.

3
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:38,249
Love me if you can.

4
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:42,789
That wouldn't be such a bad idea either.

5
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,118
So...

6
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:48,329
be the first human to love me.

7
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:57,728
So...

8
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,073
what do you mean by that?

9
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:04,039
When you tried to save me, you said you just wanted to.

10
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:06,439
So you told me to just thank you.

11
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:09,408
This is my way of thanking you.

12
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:11,753
You just want to die.

13
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:13,249
I want to save you.

14
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,354
You don't mean that.

15
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:18,258
How can my offer be bad for you?

16
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:19,689
Yes, it can.

17
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:23,488
It's ruining my mood. It puts me in a bad mood.

18
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:25,999
Does your feeling matter more than staying alive?

19
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:29,833
You don't know how you look...

20
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,469
when you look at things that disappear, right?

21
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,568
I know that face because I see that every day.

22
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,768
When I look at you looking at me,

23
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:39,609
I can see right through you.

24
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,419
- See what? - That you're a good guy.

25
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:51,119
Staying alive isn't what I want.

26
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,359
I want to live a happy life.

27
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:56,089
And I just realized that.

28
00:01:57,494 --> 00:01:59,229
That's how I came to this conclusion.

29
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,499
I...

30
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:11,209
don't think I can be happy after making you disappear.

31
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,388
So don't get cheeky with me.

32
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:35,499
I apologize for any concerns I have caused.

33
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,204
I will cooperate to the best of my abilities.

34
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:38,538
I can fall in love.

35
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:40,939
I can fall in love.

36
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,209
- What are you doing? - Mind your business.

37
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:44,739
I can fall in love.

38
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:46,543
I can fall...

39
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:48,214
You're making that hard.

40
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,214
in love.

41
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:50,908
What? No. I can't. What?

42
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:53,749
Darn it.

43
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:55,723
You sure are trying hard.

44
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:59,459
("The CEO of Kanghan Pharmaceuticals Gets Arrested for Embezzlement")

45
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:00,959
This won't work.

46
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:08,304
Starting tonight, I'm going to sleep alone in my room.

47
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:10,929
- Why? - To detach myself from you.

48
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:18,538
Let's sleep together.

49
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,679
Sleep with me.

50
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,619
Hey, stop acting.

51
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,258
You got me.

52
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,559
Darn you.

53
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,499
When you go into your room, I should do something to your house.

54
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,269
Hey!

55
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,939
Gosh.

56
00:03:57,753 --> 00:04:00,024
I'm sleeping here because I'm concerned...

57
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:01,418
that you might do something to my house.

58
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:04,619
Okay.

59
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:06,418
I'm serious.

60
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:08,318
Sure.

61
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,133
Do you even know what it means to love someone?

62
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,128
Why do you keep telling me to love you?

63
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,468
Since I don't know what love is, I'm telling you to love me.

64
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:22,208
Forget it.

65
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,448
Love me.

66
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:31,979
Then, I'll die for you.

67
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:42,989
Good night.

68
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:05,148
(Mister)

69
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:08,049
How can she name me Human when I'm not even human?

70
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:09,888
She's so weird.

71
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:11,749
How suitable.

72
00:05:11,993 --> 00:05:13,989
- The name? - The girl.

73
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,828
A weirdo met another weirdo.

74
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:20,299
You created her and are calling her weird.

75
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,169
To be named, there must be people who would need to call you.

76
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,373
And now, you got someone who would call for you.

77
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:27,999
- I didn't ask for it. - Yes, you did.

78
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:30,768
You always did like a little kid.

79
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:37,208
So will you disappear?

80
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:41,584
What...

81
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:45,018
Wasn't that your plan? After getting her to love you?

82
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,388
"The deities know everything."

83
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,229
"They just pretend to be clueless."

84
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,173
Will it go as you planned?

85
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,429
(50 cents)

86
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,169
What do you mean?

87
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:09,078
Love can be more dangerous than you think.

88
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:11,878
To protect their loved ones, they can throw away the world.

89
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,078
You don't know how it will turn out.

90
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:17,218
And I always find that fun.

91
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,004
Did you see the new part-timer at the cafe?

92
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:29,673
Since he's new, I see a new kind of hotness.

93
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:31,468
Hey, can you set me up with someone?

94
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:34,543
Hey, I saw him for the first time on my way to work.

95
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,208
Not that part-timer.

96
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,683
Do you know any guys who deserve to die?

97
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,409
If you do, can you introduce me to them?

98
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:42,014
You don't know what you're asking.

99
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:43,584
Why would I set you up with losers?

100
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,718
Exactly. Introduce me to losers.

101
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,183
I'll handle them.

102
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:48,824
How will you handle them?

103
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,024
Nicely to perfection.

104
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:54,223
I'll get rid of them as if they never existed here.

105
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,359
Are you in a cleanup crew?

106
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:56,964
Should I set you up with Mr. Park?

107
00:06:56,964 --> 00:07:00,033
Oh, right. I forgot about the CEO.

108
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,204
Unbelievable.

109
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,634
Are you that stressed out?

110
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,229
Do you have to end a guy?

111
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,799
Let's look at this hot guy and calm down.

112
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,568
Let's go.

113
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:14,309
Hello.

114
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,148
Dong Kyung.

115
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:20,479
"Dong Kyung"?

116
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:23,518
Well...

117
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,458
You should quit your job first.

118
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:34,198
Why?

119
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,429
I'll take care of everything.

120
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,169
Take care of what?

121
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:40,999
Making money.

122
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:46,578
Sun Kyung.

123
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,648
What?

124
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:57,919
It's so odd, you know. It wasn't fun at all.

125
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:01,518
At times, I really didn't want to do it.

126
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,134
But now that...

127
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,429
I will have to quit not because I want to,

128
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,128
I strangely want to keep working.

129
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,299
Come to think of it,

130
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,669
this was the longest job I had in my life.

131
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:17,309
So...

132
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:21,409
don't steal my last six years of my life.

133
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:25,008
I already started to feel how precious my time is.

134
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:30,218
Sorry.

135
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:34,318
I'm sorry for all the mean things I said, the lies I told you,

136
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:36,828
and wasting your life. I'm sorry for everything.

137
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:40,498
Sorry.

138
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:46,598
Hey, that doesn't suit you. Don't be so apologetic.

139
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:48,139
Right back at you.

140
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,269
Don't sound like you're counting the days until you die.

141
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,039
Don't give up.

142
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:57,448
This is so annoying.

143
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:02,718
Go. I need to go back to work.

144
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:05,149
I'm working too.

145
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:08,419
Good luck.

146
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:11,358
You too.

147
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:15,799
Sure. I'll do my best too...

148
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:17,698
at everything.

149
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,399
Is that really what I said?

150
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,409
I can't reach Young Prince.

151
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:26,079
I take it back.

152
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:27,978
I was talking nonsense.

153
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:30,753
His mom acts like she doesn't know anything either.

154
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,279
She keeps telling me she doesn't know where her son is.

155
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:36,623
Did he say anything to you the last time you met him?

156
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:38,089
No, not really.

157
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:42,089
We already uploaded a post about his upcoming novel.

158
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:47,704
Yes, I know that.

159
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:49,503
Do everything you can to bring him back.

160
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:50,829
That's our only solution.

161
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,098
This is so annoying.

162
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:57,773
You're not talking about me, are you?

163
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,608
Everything is so annoying.

164
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:04,409
But not me, right?

165
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,049
These darn writers...

166
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:10,419
are so ungrateful.

167
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,358
I should gather them and make them dig holes for no reason.

168
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,903
All they ever do is write novels.

169
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:21,974
But just because we're so submissive,

170
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:23,803
they become so full of themselves.

171
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,873
Everyone looks down on me...

172
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:28,398
including the kids!

173
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,709
Darn it.

174
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:32,539
You're starting to make me feel guilty.

175
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,253
I mean, how could he suddenly go MIA...

176
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:39,783
a week before the main event of his upcoming novel?

177
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:41,478
- My gosh. - What?

178
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:44,049
You should've given me the opportunity instead.

179
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:48,459
I guess you have to be a little nuts to be a good writer.

180
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:50,429
Do you think I'm too normal?

181
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:52,559
You are...

182
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:57,128
one of the few sane writers.

183
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:59,799
That's why I love you.

184
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:03,738
Should I just love that little punk?

185
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:06,783
No, the age gap is just too big...

186
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:07,939
for me to love him.

187
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:11,184
Stop leaving out the subject and object of your sentence.

188
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,248
I can't seem to follow because you're all over the place.

189
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,324
Ji Na, do you happen to know any horrible guys...

190
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,289
you want to kill?

191
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:18,819
What if I do?

192
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:20,493
Introduce me to him.

193
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:21,919
Should I introduce you to Hyun Kyu?

194
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:25,189
Should I kill him for you?

195
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:26,628
Hey.

196
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:28,974
I'm kidding.

197
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:31,199
You said you're going to go to the school reunion.

198
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:35,439
I thought you planned to kill him yourself.

199
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,569
That was the plan.

200
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:41,279
But?

201
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:43,608
But someone told me...

202
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:46,748
that what I'm doing isn't revenge but a struggle to get over him.

203
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:49,789
Who told you that? Mr. Cha?

204
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:52,988
How did you know?

205
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:58,429
Ji Na, about Mr. Cha...

206
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,344
He apparently pitied you back then.

207
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:08,268
That's why he kissed you.

208
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:13,378
What?

209
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:17,949
- How's work? - It's going well.

210
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:19,919
Goodness.

211
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,919
I know you're just saying that.

212
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:25,893
I heard the cafe on the first floor is doing very well.

213
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,189
I recognized Hyun Kyu the moment I saw him.

214
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:31,233
He has what it takes to run a business.

215
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:34,598
The company you work for is my biggest worry in that building.

216
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:37,503
I can easily tell that the CEO is an idler.

217
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,974
How is he going to afford to pay the rent?

218
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,173
You get your rent every month.

219
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,574
That's because I do a good job of managing your building.

220
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,413
That company won't last long.

221
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:47,209
I've seen many different tenants for dozens of years.

222
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,013
The fact that you're here eating steak with me...

223
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:50,383
instead of working overtime...

224
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:52,984
Hasn't it occurred to you that I made time to be with you?

225
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:54,984
Your brother is so busy managing my buildings...

226
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,224
that it's hard to even meet him.

227
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:57,393
I'd rather prefer you do that.

228
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,023
Then why don't you put me in charge...

229
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,988
of a few more buildings, so I can become a lot busier?

230
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:03,628
I'm not going to fall for that.

231
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,964
Don't even think of slacking off just because I'm rich.

232
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:07,728
I gave up on that dream when I was in kindergarten.

233
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:10,934
You really do take after me. You never lose an argument.

234
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:13,598
Dad, let's get this straight.

235
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:15,468
My looks come from Mom.

236
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:22,748
Are you seeing anyone?

237
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:25,283
You're a handsome fellow thanks to your mother.

238
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:26,423
I'm seeing a lot of women.

239
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:28,378
Really? How many?

240
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:31,194
Well, about 30.

241
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:32,464
You darn punk.

242
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:34,689
Hearing you call me that tells me it's time for me to leave.

243
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:37,334
I'm done with my briefing and dinner, so I'll go now.

244
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,689
I stayed for too long.

245
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:44,204
A man should be responsible for his actions.

246
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:46,339
The same goes for women, you punk.

247
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:50,513
That's what I'm doing right now.

248
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:51,738
(Na Ji Na)

249
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,339
- Hello? - Do you pity me?

250
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,848
I asked you if you pity me.

251
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:59,478
Yes, I pitied you back then.

252
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:01,118
But not anymore.

253
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:03,494
Did you eat dinner?

254
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,218
That's the last thing you should be worried about.

255
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:06,858
Then let's just say you ate.

256
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:09,163
Why did you want to meet?

257
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:11,533
I'm sure it wasn't because you wanted to argue about this.

258
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,633
- Actually, that's exactly why. - Then we should go.

259
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:16,529
Did you also offer to sign a deal because you pitied me?

260
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:18,529
Do I seem like a person who'd do that?

261
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:20,643
No, it's not that...

262
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:23,508
Then do you doubt my judgment regarding your competence?

263
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:26,309
Or do you just think you're not that good of a writer?

264
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,248
(Hyun Kyu)

265
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:43,559
(Hyun Kyu)

266
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:47,898
It's okay. You can take the call.

267
00:14:52,273 --> 00:14:53,543
- Hey. - Why didn't you pick up?

268
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:54,574
What are you doing right now?

269
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:55,974
When are you coming home? I'm hungry.

270
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:57,809
It's your turn to cook today.

271
00:14:57,844 --> 00:14:59,439
I'm working. I'll be late.

272
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,684
Who's making you work until so late?

273
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,378
What a jerk.

274
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,179
You're the jerk.

275
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,518
What? Me? Why?

276
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:12,248
- Let's hang up. - Joo Ik!

277
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:18,459
This guy's the person I pity.

278
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:20,529
So what about the deal?

279
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,429
Are you going to sign it or not?

280
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:28,439
I signed it.

281
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,309
You won't regret it.

282
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:32,638
You sound like a con artist when you say that.

283
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,484
I feel like I will.

284
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:35,484
That won't be too bad either.

285
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:37,309
I've seen you regret things several times anyway.

286
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,354
You might not know it, but you don't look so bad...

287
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,819
when you regret something.

288
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:45,419
Next time, let's meet at your studio. I'll call you.

289
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,923
I need to check my schedule...

290
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:49,334
You agreed to comply with all of my demands.

291
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,628
It's a done deal.

292
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:00,398
Gosh, I'm so stupid.

293
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:02,909
I got too convinced.

294
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:18,419
Gosh, you startled me. What are you doing here?

295
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:20,789
Did you find a jerk to kill so you can save your life?

296
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,358
I'm looking for one, so don't worry.

297
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,728
I can't help but worry.

298
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:29,628
You're special to me.

299
00:16:36,214 --> 00:16:39,478
My gosh. Unbelievable.

300
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:42,549
Look at you playing tricks again.

301
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,348
I'm not playing tricks. I'm very sincere.

302
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:49,923
At least bring me flowers to show that you mean it.

303
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:51,848
Is that what I should've done?

304
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:55,118
Seriously? Are you provoking me right now?

305
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:56,833
Why are you angry? I'm trying to help you.

306
00:16:56,834 --> 00:17:00,228
You're not helping. You're getting in my way.

307
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:02,098
Give me that. I'll carry it.

308
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:05,843
Hey, I'm warning you.

309
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:08,938
Stop being nice to me.

310
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:10,839
Give it to me.

311
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:13,638
Hey... Give me that.

312
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:17,009
- My gosh, come on. - Looking nice, you guys.

313
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,219
You guys look like a newlywed couple.

314
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:20,549
Hey, Brother-in-law.

315
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:23,124
- Hi, Brother-in-law. - Cut it out.

316
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:25,454
What are you doing here all of a sudden?

317
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:26,559
Me?

318
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:28,158
I came to give you this.

319
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:31,789
I got you bungeoppang. Have them while they're still warm.

320
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:35,358
I saw them outside, and I was reminded of you.

321
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:38,934
I bet you don't know this. Dong Kyung loves adzuki beans.

322
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:42,739
She goes crazy over omegi rice cakes and bungeoppang.

323
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:44,969
Oh, really?

324
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:47,444
I thought she loved flowers.

325
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:48,579
"Flowers"?

326
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:51,408
Well, yes. She likes flowers too.

327
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:53,648
She just likes getting a lot of stuff.

328
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,348
Just keep buying her stuff to keep her happy.

329
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:59,418
Hey, what's your schedule tomorrow?

330
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:02,388
Me? I have work tomorrow. I start work in the afternoon.

331
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:05,958
That's good. I need you to come somewhere with me.

332
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:07,128
Where?

333
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:09,928
I wasn't talking to you.

334
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:11,569
Where?

335
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:14,404
It won't take long.

336
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:16,969
- Where to? - Where to?

337
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:22,479
You'll find out.

338
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:25,509
Why won't you tell me? Where are you guys going?

339
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:42,098
- Can we talk outside? - Sure.

340
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,273
I was worried it might be genetic.

341
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:48,299
That was the first thing that came to my mind.

342
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:51,668
I have him to rely on, but as for him,

343
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:57,708
I got worried he might get sick after I die.

344
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,749
I'm glad.

345
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:03,653
It's nice to know you have something to cling to.

346
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:04,989
"Cling to"?

347
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:06,763
To what?

348
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:08,888
Your life.

349
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:13,803
Your brother called and begged me...

350
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,533
to convince you.

351
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:19,128
He begged me to save your life...

352
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:21,469
and told me he can't live without you.

353
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:25,269
Well, so...

354
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,739
I was hallucinating.

355
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:31,914
People would show up out of nowhere...

356
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,019
and disappear.

357
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:37,888
That's not what matters.

358
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,388
I think it really weighed down on my heart...

359
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:43,589
that I couldn't persuade you.

360
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:49,368
That's why I'm taking back what I said.

361
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:52,839
Get treated.

362
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:57,208
Even if it's only for a year or a few months, live longer.

363
00:19:58,244 --> 00:19:59,378
Take this...

364
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:02,708
whenever you're in pain.

365
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,979
Take it and endure it,

366
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:06,549
and think it over.

367
00:20:07,484 --> 00:20:08,819
I'll hope you'll agree.

368
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,358
I really want to save your life.

369
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:18,158
I don't want another editor working on my next story.

370
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:21,928
You're the best at finding typos.

371
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:30,368
(Tak Dong Kyung)

372
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:51,688
(Condolences)

373
00:20:54,863 --> 00:20:56,368
Open this for me.

374
00:20:58,204 --> 00:20:59,744
Hey, which bus do I need to take...

375
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,198
to get to Myeong-dong?

376
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:04,569
Open it for me. I'm thirsty.

377
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:06,279
Okay.

378
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:12,348
Here.

379
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:16,918
Right?

380
00:21:18,454 --> 00:21:19,464
What?

381
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,559
From the bus stop.

382
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:27,598
It's so cool, meeting you again like that.

383
00:21:33,603 --> 00:21:36,438
- Are you sick? - What do you have?

384
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:38,174
What? Me?

385
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:40,279
You must be here because you're sick.

386
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:44,779
Well...

387
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:47,479
It looks like neither of us wants to say.

388
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,279
I meant let's change the subject.

389
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:52,858
Okay.

390
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,729
What's the flower pot for?

391
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:01,729
Oh, this?

392
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:04,474
I'm waiting for it to bud.

393
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:05,668
What did you plant?

394
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:08,438
Well...

395
00:22:08,904 --> 00:22:10,208
I don't know...

396
00:22:10,543 --> 00:22:12,108
if it'll actually bud...

397
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:14,438
and if it does, what it'll be.

398
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,549
What if something strange grows?

399
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:22,719
- I'll pull it out. - You'll pull it out?

400
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:25,888
It's okay. I can just plant something else...

401
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:28,789
since this is mine.

402
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:32,128
That one isn't mine,

403
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:34,529
but this one...

404
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:36,698
is mine.

405
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:43,638
I hope something good grows.

406
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:46,108
I hope so too.

407
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:48,438
I've put in a lot of effort, and I am waiting patiently...

408
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,309
since it's my first time.

409
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,829
I'm done drinking, so I'm going to go.

410
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:10,168
What? Okay.

411
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,799
Here's a gift since you opened my bottle for me.

412
00:23:24,714 --> 00:23:26,219
I'll be seeing you.

413
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,479
(Tak Brother)

414
00:23:56,154 --> 00:23:57,279
Hey.

415
00:23:58,283 --> 00:23:59,479
Are you done?

416
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:01,819
Okay.

417
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:04,323
Why did they lock up...

418
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:06,759
that crazy murderer in the hospital?

419
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:10,158
I think the ghost is cursed.

420
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:12,729
Maybe it's that ghost.

421
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:16,499
- A ghost? - Yes.

422
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:20,598
This rumor started a few years ago that there's a doctor...

423
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:22,769
who's really a ghost.

424
00:24:23,144 --> 00:24:24,773
Lots of people saw him.

425
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:27,513
But strangely, no one saw him twice.

426
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,178
How scary.

427
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:31,384
- What? - Why?

428
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:33,118
I think I saw that ghost doctor.

429
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:35,154
Last time, when I came to,

430
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:37,989
I was bawling in front of a doctor for no reason.

431
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:39,593
For the life of me,

432
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:41,224
I couldn't remember why I was crying.

433
00:24:41,224 --> 00:24:42,989
It was weird, so I asked,

434
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:46,299
and they said there was no such doctor.

435
00:24:47,563 --> 00:24:49,363
Then whom did I meet?

436
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,729
He was about this tall, right?

437
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:54,874
No. He was much taller.

438
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:57,513
At least 190cm.

439
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:00,309
Lady in the next room saw him too.

440
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:02,984
She said he looked about 20 years old.

441
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:04,948
No. He had gray hair.

442
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,118
He was at least in his 50s.

443
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:08,553
Excuse me.

444
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:11,593
You said you saw that ghost too, didn't you?

445
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,958
What did he look like?

446
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:14,664
Was he this big...

447
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:15,994
or this big?

448
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:18,259
A young man in his 20s? Or an old man in his 50s?

449
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:20,598
It was...

450
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,898
a woman.

451
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:27,668
- There is more than one. - Right.

452
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:29,644
Switch hospitals.

453
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,509
It's too late for us.

454
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:39,509
Thank you, doctor.

455
00:25:39,984 --> 00:25:41,219
I'm sorry...

456
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:43,789
for worrying you and wasting your time.

457
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:47,363
A doctor is just trying to treat a patient.

458
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:48,658
Why are you sorry?

459
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,759
It's only natural for you to bug me about deadlines.

460
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,299
It's only natural for me to do this.

461
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:57,598
Since we're on the topic,

462
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:01,499
you know the deadline is next week.

463
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:06,408
You switch gears instantly...

464
00:26:06,484 --> 00:26:08,309
when you talk about work.

465
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:11,648
Hi there.

466
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,648
Hey. How did you know I was here?

467
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,118
I brought flowers this time.

468
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:26,428
You have another little brother?

469
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,499
- Are you the youngest? - Him?

470
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:32,469
No.

471
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:35,303
Is he your boyfriend?

472
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,108
He looks much younger than your brother...

473
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,079
What? Boy... Boyfriend?

474
00:26:40,414 --> 00:26:42,579
He looks much younger... Hold on.

475
00:26:44,214 --> 00:26:46,918
My apologies. My apologies.

476
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:49,319
I shouldn't have asked something so personal.

477
00:26:49,753 --> 00:26:52,148
Love breaks all boundaries.

478
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:54,523
- Age is nothing. - What?

479
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:56,289
Our age difference isn't that big.

480
00:26:56,964 --> 00:26:58,059
What?

481
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:02,658
Have we met before?

482
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:05,969
No, we haven't.

483
00:27:07,644 --> 00:27:08,769
Dong Kyung!

484
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:10,469
Hey.

485
00:27:12,444 --> 00:27:14,239
- Big brother? - Big brother?

486
00:27:18,384 --> 00:27:20,549
Sure, that's right.

487
00:27:20,684 --> 00:27:22,924
Age doesn't matter when it comes to family hierarchies.

488
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:26,323
I understand. I have an uncle who's younger than I am.

489
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:28,388
He's only this big, but...

490
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:30,259
Did you dye your hair?

491
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:31,858
It looks good.

492
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,658
It looks good against your skin tone.

493
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:36,398
Hey.

494
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:38,299
Did you dye your hair?

495
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,138
That must be what he sees.

496
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:44,974
Please get back safely.

497
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:46,878
Call me if you need anything.

498
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:49,343
I will. Thank you, doctor.

499
00:27:49,343 --> 00:27:50,608
Thank you, doctor.

500
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:00,793
Let's take a picture.

501
00:28:00,793 --> 00:28:03,063
A picture? That's so random.

502
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:04,989
To celebrate you getting flowers from him.

503
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:07,404
Flowers? No...

504
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:08,934
These are just...

505
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:11,069
Aren't they from him? Did you find them?

506
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:13,269
I did give them to her.

507
00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:14,739
See?

508
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:17,513
Come on. Get in.

509
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:19,108
1, 2, 3.

510
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:24,148
See? It looks good.

511
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:28,253
Hey. What's wrong with him? Why does he look like this?

512
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:29,918
What? He came out nice.

513
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:33,089
Do you think he looks much better in person?

514
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:35,188
Give it a rest.

515
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:36,928
It came out nice.

516
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,428
Hey, how...

517
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:42,858
He looks good.

518
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:44,499
This is...

519
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:46,668
Hey.

520
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:50,739
I ran through a bunch of theories in my head...

521
00:28:52,674 --> 00:28:57,148
Does everyone see you differently?

522
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:00,283
Sun Kyung says you dyed your hair.

523
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:02,479
Mr. Jung asks if you're my youngest brother.

524
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:05,019
I'm obviously much younger.

525
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:07,789
I don't know about that last part.

526
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:10,029
Am I right?

527
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:12,033
Didn't I tell you?

528
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,829
I'm right? For real?

529
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:15,033
Wow.

530
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:17,734
Then what I see may not be the real you...

531
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:18,999
It is the real me.

532
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,368
Only you can see the real me.

533
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:24,868
It seems that way.

534
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:28,408
- How? - That's why you're a weirdo.

535
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,684
You can see the real me, call for me,

536
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:32,809
and gave me a name.

537
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:41,059
That's why you kept telling me to love you.

538
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:43,634
You know, when someone can see you for who you really are,

539
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:46,329
it makes your heart flutter. That's it, right?

540
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:53,969
If you don't answer that, it makes me feel so awkward.

541
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:00,414
Did I figure out your move? Is that it?

542
00:30:00,414 --> 00:30:03,249
Are you saying I'm the first woman to see the real you or something?

543
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:05,848
It's true. You are the first person...

544
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:07,378
that I ever interacted with in this way.

545
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:14,019
Everything is a first to me.

546
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:22,128
Is that so? I see.

547
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:24,469
Okay. I see.

548
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:49,319
Kim Human, stop!

Hey. You! Wait. Excuse me.

00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:08,908
Hey!

554
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:11,678
Hey! Park Young!

555
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:15,219
Park Young... Hey, Young Prince!

556
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:24,958
Hey. What? What was that?

557
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:28,563
Did you just look away? Our eyes just met!

558
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:31,299
I know you just saw me! Hey!

559
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:33,029
Hold on.

560
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:40,438
What? Should I put you back in?

(Don't find me.)

00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,638
Don't find me. I'll be at the dorm starting today.

565
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:10,868
And phones aren't allowed here, so you can't reach me.

566
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:15,083
And tell your friends about me.

567
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,208
Thanks.

568
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:26,863
Hey, can you make him get eliminated?

569
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,059
Is that your wish?

(The First Open Audition Program for the Male Lead)

571
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:35,428
It's not a wish.

572
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:39,428
Do you think you can get in there as a judge?

573
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:42,143
I asked you if that's your wish.

574
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:44,773
Come on. How can you be so calculative?

575
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:47,908
We live together. You can just help me out this once.

576
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,479
I'm being serious.

577
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:55,579
I'm serious.

578
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,989
Can't you turn into Park Chan Uk or Bong Joon Ho?

579

How can a writer apply to an audition TV program?

That's unheard of.

583
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,859
What if he really becomes the male lead?

584
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:40,029
He might win.

585
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:41,653
He has the most votes right now.

586

what would you wish for...

if you could make one wish before dying?

594

But you can't make a wish to save your life.

595
00:34:06,948 --> 00:34:09,419
And you can't ask for multiple wishes. What would you wish for?

596
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:10,983
- Money. - Money.

597
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:13,954
- Fame. - "Fame"?

What if you could only live for...

599
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:19,823
Yes.

600
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:22,193
Yes, hello. Hello?

601
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:24,494
Hey...

602
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:27,804
Yes. Really?

603
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,733
Of course.

604
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:32,874
Okay. Thanks.

605
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,549
- What did you say? - Forget it.

606
00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:39,974
You are getting seasonal mood swings.

Hey, don't worry.

608

That was a call for your blind date.

I set up what you asked for the other day.

612
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:54,863
You can go after work later today. It's set up.

613
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:57,498
- What? - "What"? What's that reaction?

614
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,494
You can't pull out now.

615
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,169
Ms. Jo, I was...

616
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:04,534
You are putting me in a tight spot.

617
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,073
A blind date?

618
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:12,879
He's been friends with my boyfriend for 10 years.

619
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:14,388
He's a really nice guy.

620
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,388
I asked you to set me up with a guy you want to get rid of.

621
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:18,558
Gosh.

622
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:21,784
If this works out, you'll want to get rid of him someday.

623
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:28,894
Sweetie.

624
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:32,138
It's this again?

625
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:33,394
Sweetie.

626
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,204
Gosh. This is new.

627
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:40,903
Hello.

628
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:44,943
Sweetie, open your mouth.

629
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:49,383
You always feed me when there are a lot of people.

630
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:54,784
Dong Kyung, what do you do after work?

631
00:35:55,828 --> 00:35:58,923
I read books at home.

00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:04,598
What about you? What do you do after work?

633
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:08,807
I don't do much because I have a pretty boring life.

634
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:10,903
I just work out a bit.

635
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:13,748
What kind of exercise do you do?

636
00:36:13,748 --> 00:36:14,748
Do you like working out?

637
00:36:14,748 --> 00:36:16,308
Yes, I do.

638
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,474
As if. I've never seen you in sneakers.

639
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:22,388
- What? - It's getting cold.

640
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,784
So don't work out too hard.

641
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:25,584
You'll get hurt.

642
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,739
Since it's getting cold, do you want to stay indoors?

643
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:44,038
Do you want to watch a movie next time? Do you like movies?

644
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:46,308
Yes, I love movies.

645
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:48,773
He's dying to see his end.

646
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:50,644
What?

647
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:55,483
Are you trying to die, sweetie?

648
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:58,713
If you keep drinking like that, you'll get drunk.

649
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,253
What? What's wrong with her?

650
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,359
Ye Ji. Ye Ji!

651
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,554
She's drunk.

652
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:08,598
- What... - Is she okay?

653
00:37:08,598 --> 00:37:10,969
You should go home now. Gosh.

654
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:12,299
She looks pretty drunk.

655
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:13,633
And you don't think you are?

656
00:37:17,138 --> 00:37:19,073
What was that again?

657
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:22,403
Let's go.

658
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:28,018
I mean... How can I leave when they are so drunk?

659
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:29,383
They'll wake up in five minutes.

660
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:32,788
Hey, hold on. But still. Wait.

661
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:34,423
They won't remember a thing anyway.

662
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:37,054
Hey. Okay. Fine. Wait.

663
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:39,423
Ye Ji...

664
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:45,368
Hey, just because you have the powers,

665
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,908
you can't do something like that just as you please. If you do...

666
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:49,034
Then, what?

667
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:51,573
Is that too mean?

668
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:53,173
What?

669
00:37:53,748 --> 00:37:54,843
That's good.

670
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:57,644
If you're looking for a bad guy who will die in place of you,

671
00:37:57,848 --> 00:38:00,244
I'm the perfect candidate.

672
00:38:01,848 --> 00:38:05,253
Is that why you came to my date today to show me that?

673
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:13,054
I have a good idea about your wish.

674
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:19,834
Make a wish to fall in love with me.

675
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,534
Are you saying that's possible?

676
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:25,673
Why wouldn't it be?

677
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:10,554
See? It's possible.

678
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:21,124
What's your type?

679
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:22,669
That's quite sudden.

680
00:39:22,669 --> 00:39:24,534
It'll help me come up with the male protagonist.

681
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:26,534
I kind of already know,

682
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:28,434
but I just need to double-check.

683
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:33,874
- A good-looking man. - That's a given.

684
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:36,843
No one wants an ugly male protagonist in a romance novel.

685
00:39:38,518 --> 00:39:40,489
- Then... - He'll be handsome for sure,

686
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:42,843
but he needs to have the ability to make a girl's heart flutter.

687
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,489
That's exactly why people get bored...

688
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,419
of your typical male protagonists. They're just good-looking.

689
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:48,689
Do you know how hard it is just to be good-looking?

690
00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:51,653
We always suffer having to hire the right illustrator for you.

691
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:55,423
Do you really think you're the one who completes the guy's looks?

692
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:58,733
Whatever.

693
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,233
A charming male protagonist is great.

694
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,239
But you need to think about what it is that makes...

695
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,434
the handsome guy so charming.

696
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,843
Is he rich or competent?

697
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:10,613
What is the one crucial thing that he lacks?

698
00:40:11,348 --> 00:40:13,319
So the female protagonist can fill up what he lacks?

699
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:14,744
Now we're talking.

700
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:27,593
But don't you think we're going too fast?

701
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,564
What do you mean?

702
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,934
We're together at my house late at night.

703
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,534
This is too fast.

704
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:37,173
We have no other choice. I have to go to work.

705
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:40,034
Plus, you prefer to work late at night.

706
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,073
Yes, you're right.

707
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:12,133
It's been bothering me for a while.

708
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:18,343
What?

709
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:20,314
Did that make your heart flutter?

710
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:22,414
No.

711
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:29,923
We should call it a day.

712
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:36,624
Joo Ik, I'm off now.

713
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,463
Thanks for lending me your car.

714
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:40,704
Sure. Let's call it a day.

715
00:41:40,908 --> 00:41:42,363
It seems like you have somewhere to go.

716
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:49,003
- When is our next meeting? - I'll call you.

717
00:42:09,899 --> 00:42:11,963
I guess you don't easily throw things away.

718
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:14,164
What?

719
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,503
- I'm going to take this. - Is it raining?

720
00:42:27,388 --> 00:42:29,814
No, it's not. But this is mine.

721
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,523
Gosh, how embarrassing.

722
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:39,954
Why did I put that there?

723
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:44,534
Darn it.

724
00:42:58,248 --> 00:42:59,374
Gosh.

725
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,815
Why am I the only girl?

726
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:13,085
I called all the other girls,

727
00:43:13,085 --> 00:43:14,479
but they suddenly canceled last minute.

728
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:16,355
I didn't know this was going to happen.

729
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:17,724
They all have boyfriends.

730
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:19,419
What kind of guy would let their girlfriend...

731
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:22,224
attend a school reunion where it's mostly men?

732
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,324
Gosh, this is sad.

733
00:43:23,324 --> 00:43:25,295
"Men"? You guys aren't men.

734
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:26,435
Of course, we're men.

735
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:30,129
But I must say, Ji Na is just as pretty as she used to be.

736
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,970
Are you seeing anyone?

737
00:43:32,205 --> 00:43:34,839
You guys are just as ugly as before.

738
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:37,105
What do you care whether or not I'm seeing anyone?

739
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:39,140
Gosh, she still has a nasty temper.

740
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:41,085
You must be upset that Hyun Kyu isn't here.

741
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,339
I bet you came to see him.

742
00:43:44,215 --> 00:43:45,780
I'm not here to see him.

743
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:47,310
I came to eat chicken.

744
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:48,924
As if...

745
00:43:48,924 --> 00:43:50,120
I thought he was coming.

746
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:52,054
He told me he'd be here.

747
00:43:52,054 --> 00:43:53,125
- Really? - Yes.

748
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,359
He never contacted me.

749
00:43:56,494 --> 00:43:57,789
I'm sure he'll show up.

750
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:08,375
Hey, Hyun Kyu.

751
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:10,045
- Hey. - Hey.

752
00:44:10,045 --> 00:44:12,215
- Get over here. - Look at you.

753
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:13,915
You guys haven't changed at all.

754
00:44:13,915 --> 00:44:15,910
- Same goes for you. - Come over here.

755
00:44:18,654 --> 00:44:20,215
There was no parking space nearby.

756
00:44:20,215 --> 00:44:21,985
So I had to drive around.

757
00:44:21,985 --> 00:44:24,689
But it looks like you found space right outside the restaurant.

758
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,289
- Nice car. - You must be doing well.

759
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,789
No, that's nonsense.

760
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:32,629
- Are you drunk? - What's your car?

761
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:34,089
I don't have a car.

762
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:36,660
- You don't? - No.

763
00:44:37,705 --> 00:44:39,804
- How are things going? - You look great.

764
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:42,444
Me? I've always looked great.

765
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:44,775
This guy hasn't aged at all.

766
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:46,815
What are you talking about?

767
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:48,485
Let's be honest. It was your fault.

768
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,740
- Cheers. - Cut it out.

769
00:44:51,215 --> 00:44:53,379
Hyun Kyu, do you still hate rice cakes?

770
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:55,080
Rice cakes?

771
00:44:55,585 --> 00:44:57,819
What do you mean? I don't hate rice cakes.

772
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:00,764
Oh, right. Was it Ji Na who didn't eat rice cakes?

773
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,890
Yes, I don't eat rice cakes.

774
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:06,490
I hate them.

775
00:45:08,634 --> 00:45:10,030
Hey, hey.

776
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:12,505
Hyun Kyu eats rice cakes even though they gave him an upset stomach...

777
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:14,200
and made him fail his CSATs.

778
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,705
But Ji Na hates them because that made him go study abroad,

779
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:19,010
which was what led them to break up.

780
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:21,080
Wait a minute.

781
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:23,839
Do you still have feelings for Hyun Kyu?

782
00:45:30,255 --> 00:45:32,255
- That's nonsense. - Gosh, let's just drink.

783
00:45:32,255 --> 00:45:34,465
- Let's just drink. - Cheers.

784
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,694
Drink up.

785
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:38,089
- It's nice to see you. - You too.

786
00:45:38,494 --> 00:45:40,729
Hey. Have you heard of the news?

787
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:58,850
Are you okay?

788
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:01,050
You drank a lot today.

789
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,490
Are you drunk?

790
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:09,165
No, I don't get drunk that easily.

791
00:46:09,165 --> 00:46:10,359
I can hold my liquor.

792
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:11,959
Really?

793
00:46:13,435 --> 00:46:14,600
That's good to hear.

794
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:19,800
- Why are you here? - I was worried about you.

795
00:46:22,844 --> 00:46:24,269
No, why are you here?

796
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:28,180
Why are you back in Korea, and why did you come to the reunion?

797
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,749
Forget it. Just go.

798
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:38,019
Should I take you home?

799
00:46:44,165 --> 00:46:45,990
It's okay. Just go.

800
00:46:49,404 --> 00:46:50,629
Here's a cab.

801
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:57,870
I'll see you.

802
00:47:52,264 --> 00:47:55,030
- Hey. - Hey. You were home.

803
00:48:15,824 --> 00:48:17,080
That's right.

804
00:48:18,924 --> 00:48:20,089
Thanks for the car.

805
00:48:21,424 --> 00:48:22,589
Sure.

806
00:48:24,494 --> 00:48:25,629
What about your first love?

807
00:48:28,465 --> 00:48:31,300
- What? - How did it go?

808
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:35,300
It was...

809
00:49:16,744 --> 00:49:18,510
We're late. Let's go.

810
00:50:24,915 --> 00:50:27,050
I can wish for that?

811
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:29,979
How could that work?

812
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,589
Make a wish to fall in love with me.

813
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:37,260
But I can't wish for that.

814
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:39,859
What does he take me for?

815
00:50:40,194 --> 00:50:42,160
Talk to yourself when you're alone.

816
00:50:43,034 --> 00:50:44,160
Sir.

817
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,800
I shouldn't have said anything.

818
00:50:47,235 --> 00:50:48,399
What?

819
00:50:49,205 --> 00:50:53,174
If you could wish for anything, what would you wish for?

820
00:50:53,174 --> 00:50:54,339
The lottery.

821
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:56,685
That was automatic.

822
00:50:56,685 --> 00:50:58,284
You must wish for that all the time.

823
00:50:58,284 --> 00:51:00,249
Everyone wishes for that.

824
00:51:00,784 --> 00:51:03,085
What if you only had 100 days left to live?

825
00:51:03,085 --> 00:51:05,019
- Would you still wish for that? - That's silly.

826
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:07,390
I'd wish to live longer.

827
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,689
You can't wish for that.

828
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,930
Is the person granting your wish good-looking?

829
00:51:14,235 --> 00:51:16,264
Yes, he is a bit...

830
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:18,005
What? How did you know it was a guy?

831
00:51:18,005 --> 00:51:21,744
No, that he's good-looking... No, that...

832
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:22,839
It's obvious.

833
00:51:22,904 --> 00:51:25,209
What main character in a romance novel isn't handsome?

834
00:51:26,244 --> 00:51:27,470
Whose story is it?

835
00:51:27,744 --> 00:51:31,550
Well, so... It's a new writer.

836
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:33,580
You wouldn't know.

837
00:51:33,614 --> 00:51:36,249
Then you should wish for a passionate relationship with him.

838
00:51:37,284 --> 00:51:40,089
- What? - Isn't that how all romances start?

839
00:51:40,924 --> 00:51:42,060
Seriously.

840
00:51:44,065 --> 00:51:46,395
"Let me truly love you."

841
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,399
Is that the correct wish?

842
00:51:48,764 --> 00:51:51,600
Seriously. Is that the only way?

843
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:53,499
What are you talking about?

844
00:51:54,435 --> 00:51:55,669
It's the opposite.

845
00:51:57,444 --> 00:52:00,275
Not me. "Make you fall in love with me."

846
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:01,680
"Crazy in love."

847
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:11,350
Crazy...

848
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:14,050
in love.

849
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:57,200
What are you doing here?

850
00:52:58,105 --> 00:53:00,470
I was hiding from the rain.

851
00:53:01,944 --> 00:53:03,539
What was I expecting?

852
00:53:04,244 --> 00:53:05,669
Did you expect something?

853
00:53:07,614 --> 00:53:08,939
Don't you have an umbrella?

854
00:53:11,215 --> 00:53:13,109
I wouldn't be standing here if I did.

855
00:53:14,085 --> 00:53:16,649
- I don't either. - I know.

856
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:29,030
Why does it always rain in my life?

857
00:53:29,364 --> 00:53:31,569
And why don't I ever have an umbrella?

858
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:40,370
Shall we run?

859
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:41,910
What?

860
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:50,780
Hey. Hey. Hey!

861
00:53:58,165 --> 00:54:00,534
Hey. Can't you stop the rain?

862
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:02,930
- I can. - Then why are we running?

863
00:54:03,235 --> 00:54:05,069
- It's fun. - What?

864
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:07,430
Stop it! Stop. Let go.

865
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:08,870
Seriously.

866
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:11,769
Look at me. I'm soaked.

867
00:54:12,045 --> 00:54:15,013
It would be better to just walk.

868
00:54:15,014 --> 00:54:16,680
That's less tiring.

869
00:54:18,085 --> 00:54:19,450
Are you still tired?

870
00:54:22,284 --> 00:54:23,680
I'm okay now.

871
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,419
I can finally breathe.

872
00:54:28,594 --> 00:54:29,760
See?

873
00:54:31,465 --> 00:54:32,789
The rain isn't a big deal.

874
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,930
Even if you're the only one without an umbrella, it's fine.

875
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:40,229
Just get wet. Get wet and run.

876
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:44,269
You'll be home soon.

877
00:54:59,654 --> 00:55:00,950
I have a wish.

878
00:55:05,194 --> 00:55:06,359
I want you...

879
00:55:07,864 --> 00:55:10,030
to love me.

880
00:55:14,105 --> 00:55:17,800
Can I wish for that too?

881
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:23,039
No.

882
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,200
If something messes up the system,

883
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:25,939
it means it was programmed wrong.

884
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,479
Something that is wrong...

885
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:32,450
must be deleted.

886
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:18,019
What is it?

887
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:25,129
Or...

888
00:57:26,775 --> 00:57:28,069
it should be reset.

889
00:58:17,685 --> 00:58:21,720
(Doom at Your Service)

890
00:58:22,694 --> 00:58:25,660
People who are nice always disappear.

891
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,665
- You're responsible for... - Hello?

892
00:58:28,665 --> 00:58:30,530
- everything that disappears. - Stop!

893
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:34,300
Let me drive you home. I'm worried.

894
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,100
Did you know Dong Kyung was sick?

895
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:41,410
So you want to be loved by her. That's it, right?

896
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:43,209
That was a wrong conclusion.

897
00:58:43,784 --> 00:58:46,080
What do you mean by that?

898
00:58:46,514 --> 00:58:49,379
You are miserable because I exist.

899
00:58:49,755 --> 00:58:52,490
So you should choose yourself and the world.
