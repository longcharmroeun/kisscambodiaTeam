00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:08,550
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,591
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,630
Oh, my! What should I do?

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,630
EPISODE 16

5
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,211
What do you think this is
that you said it is precious?

6
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:38,251
Why is Dongmongseonseup precious to you?

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,821
- It's...
- Was it you?

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,321
The person who saved me. Was it you?

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,791
Did you save me from the well?

10
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,840
Yes. It was me.

11
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,980
Did you already forget?

12
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:10,250
I went through so much
trouble to carry you back.

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,021
My arms are still sore from that day.

14
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:17,920
I can't believe you already
forgot about that. You're so mean.

15
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,730
I am talking about eight years ago.

16
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,890
That wasn't the first time
you fell into the well?

17
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,931
Why are you so absentminded?

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,640
Then why is this book important to you?

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,870
It looks like something that would
appear on "Authentic Masterpieces".

20
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,980
You are saying weird things again.

21
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:43,821
After I had a dream about
getting stuck in the well,

22
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,321
I was reminded of you right away.

23
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,390
I thought it was because
you saved me from the well,

24
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,791
but since then...

25
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,890
you constantly overlap with the
girl that saved me eight years ago.

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,961
I thought that you might be that girl.

27
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:06,271
It doesn't taste good when
the noodles get soggy.

28
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:08,670
Do you want some?

29
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:13,180
Enjoy it.

30
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:19,351
My goodness.

31
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:25,321
Blow on the noodles and
take your time eating them.

32
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,901
What are you reading so intently?

33
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:38,471
It is a book on tactics used
during the Ming Dynasty.

34
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,941
A book on tactics?

35
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,841
The military?

36
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,480
Are you starting a war or something?

37
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,841
If I want to establish royal authority,

38
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:48,851
I need a strong military to support me.

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,721
Do you still have nightmares...

40
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,091
about dying as an incompetent king?

41
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,691
I do on occasion.

42
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:06,930
Even if that really happens, it's
not because you're inadequate.

43
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:09,170
That's just the flow of history.

44
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:13,170
Within the flow of the universe,
you just happened to be there.

45
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,341
It's not your fault.

46
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:16,411
That could be.

47
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,881
So don't struggle so much in pain.

48
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:22,811
If it's your destiny,

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,381
you can't stop it anyway.

50
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,020
When I wake up from a nightmare,

51
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:35,161
I sometimes have a strange feeling.

52
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,561
As if that dream is the present,

53
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:41,170
and we are currently in the past.

54
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:51,881
It is as though I am having a dream
in the last moments of my life...

55
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,010
before my death as an incompetent king.

56
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,450
A dream about this moment...

57
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,960
when I still have a chance and
can still try to do something.

58
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,101
It could be that...

59
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,641
I am doing this to fight against my destiny.

60
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,420
I want to put everything on the line
for this man who is bound to lose.

61
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,761
EPISODE 16, ALL IN

62
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,170
You will end up winning in that fight.

63
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,701
I always choose the winning side.

64
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:55,740
As long as I'm on your side,
you will end up winning.

65
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,550
Your confidence is reassuring.

66
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,120
It's because I have a secret weapon.

67
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,591
I know the future.

68
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,661
Do you remember...

69
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,291
when I told you that I'm a man who
came from 200 years in the future?

70
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,860
Yes, I do. That absurd story.

71
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,791
What if that's the truth...

72
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,101
and I give you the knowledge of the future?

73
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,370
Do you expect me to believe that?

74
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,841
If it's hard to believe,

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,711
just think that I had a dream.
A vivid dream of the future.

76
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:34,081
My gosh.

77
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,451
If that is the case, I will not
believe in that absurd story,

78
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,490
but I will listen to it.

79
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,230
What is Joseon like in 200 years?

80
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,391
Well, then...

81
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,630
This is just a story that I'm making up,

82
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,240
but we don't call it Joseon anymore.

83
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,940
The Republic of Korea.
That's the future of Joseon.

84
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:04,940
"The Republic of Korea"?

85
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,880
In the Republic of Korea, the
people choose their own king.

86
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,550
That does not make sense.

87
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,021
You should say something that makes sense...

88
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:13,891
for me to believe or fall for it.

89
00:06:14,221 --> 00:06:15,750
We'll be in trouble if you're
already starting to doubt me.

90
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,690
This is just the beginning
of my ridiculous story.

91
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:22,031
In 200 years, there is no such
thing as a commoner or a noble.

92
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,300
Are you saying that people will
no longer be divided by class?

93
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,630
Of course, there will be a
different type of ranking.

94
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,430
Dirt spoons and silver spoons.

95
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,411
You identify people with spoons
instead of identity tags?

96
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:38,341
Then do the people bring spoons
when they choose the king?

97
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,781
It's called voting.

98
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:42,651
After you turn 18,

99
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,120
you are given the right
to choose the king by law.

100
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:49,120
- You can choose the king?
- That's right.

101
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,591
Why is it when you turn 18?

102
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,630
The Queen was running around
the Palace all day like that.

103
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,370
Good job.

104
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,680
From now on, your job is to keep an
eye on everything the Queen does.

105
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,120
Byeong In.

106
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,690
Since you have become the
youngest Minister of War,

107
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,101
you have become more handsome.

108
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,800
Is that all?

109
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,170
- Of course not.
- I knew it.

110
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:39,440
Congratulations.

111
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:49,511
By the way, Byeong In.

112
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:52,480
Is it impossible for our family...

113
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,851
to get along with the King?

114
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,961
He is special to the Queen,

115
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,060
and he does not seem to be a bad person.

116
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,591
The King does not sincerely
cherish the Queen.

117
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:09,031
He will always corner the Queen into
a deadly situation for his own gain.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
I did not see him that way.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,641
That is what I hate most about him.

120
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,411
He hides behind a mask and women.

121
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,151
He hides his true self and
fools others with his two faces.

122
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:24,480
The Queen has also been
fooled by that face...

123
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,951
and is willing to turn her back on
her family for the sake of the King.

124
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:30,451
However, the King will only
use those feelings of hers.

125
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,031
According to what I have heard,
it is actually the King...

126
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:35,731
who is head over heels for the Queen.

127
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,531
When it comes to the King's love life,

128
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:41,600
what the court maids say among
themselves is the most exact.

129
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,771
Last night, the two of them
were so deep in conversation...

130
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,111
that the lights of Huijeongjeon
Hall were on all night.

131
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:19,200
If Cheoljong succeeds,

132
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,141
then the world in 200 years
will be different too, right?

133
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:24,281
If history changes, then the
Japanese Occupation won't happen,

134
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,810
and a scumbag like Mr. Han
won't exist either.

135
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,950
I'm not doing this for Cheoljong.

136
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,991
This is purely for my benefit.

137
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:38,361
Saving you...

138
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,291
is how I save myself.

139
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,810
Your Highness.

140
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,011
Your Highness. Your father has collapsed.

141
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,850
My goodness.

142
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,791
No need to get up.

143
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,231
- How did this happen?
- It is dangerous.

144
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:19,330
Why would you come all the way here?

145
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,700
No. The Palace is more dangerous.

146
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,340
Your Highness. You should
stay here from now on.

147
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,940
I will protect you and
make sure you are safe.

148
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,251
You must have collapsed because
of what had happened to me.

149
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:38,881
It is all my fault.

150
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,090
I might as well have given
you the poison myself.

151
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,190
I made such a useless item and
did not take good care of it.

152
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,560
They were the ones who were wrong.

153
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:54,031
It is not your fault, so
please do not blame yourself.

154
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:56,371
Just focus on regaining your health.

155
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:57,901
I am fine.

156
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,741
As long as you are happy, I am fine.

157
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,511
So Your Highness,

158
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,350
step down from your position now.

159
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,920
- Father.
- So Yong.

160
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,491
When your mother had you,

161
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,060
there was something she
would always say to me.

162
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,731
She said that you would live
in a better world than she did.

163
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,460
That you will get to do
everything she could not do.

164
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,300
The expectation that you will
live a better life than hers...

165
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,840
was your mother's last wish.

166
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,070
How will I...

167
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,111
face your mother in the afterworld now?

168
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,850
Father.

169
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:46,580
I will do everything that
Mother wanted for me.

170
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,861
I intend to get revenge for
everything they did to me and more.

171
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,090
Your Highness.

172
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,460
So you must not become weak like this either.

173
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,371
There is something you must do for me.

174
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,141
Okay. Tell me about whatever you need.

175
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,871
I will do whatever you want.

176
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:12,111
STORAGE SALE

177
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,950
THE LORD HAS LOST HIS MIND!

178
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:19,981
This is unexpected from
someone as frugal as him.

179
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,220
What if he makes us pay
double for it later on?

180
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,261
Oh, my.

181
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:26,491
Thank you.

182
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:29,131
Lord Kim and the Queen...

183
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:31,700
will have a long life too.

184
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,300
Did he give him a whole bag of rice?

185
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,771
He must have really lost his mind.

186
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,371
He kindly lost his mind.

187
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,641
There is something you must do.

188
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,511
Take your hands off the corruption...

189
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,981
and build your reputation.

190
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,190
Are you really going to sell all
of this and give it to people?

191
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,190
Of course.

192
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,991
It is not like I can take all
this wealth to the grave with me.

193
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:13,340
Excuse me. Could you let go?

194
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,741
Materialism is a habit.

195
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,720
Your father made a huge decision.

196
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,820
That's not all.

197
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,161
This is the ledger you were looking for.

198
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:41,501
Father remembered everything that was in it.

199
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,741
Everyone was more trashy than we thought.

200
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:50,810
The Left State Councilor messed
around a lot with exchanging grain.

201
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:53,011
He siphoned off the grains
using various methods,

202
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:54,810
but the amount is substantial.

203
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,080
The Chief State Councilor's
specialty is messing with the land.

204
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,251
For example, he'll force a quarry
on someone and make them work on it,

205
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:04,761
and then hit them with a lot of taxes.

206
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,391
There's nobody who didn't pocket something,

207
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,560
and there's nothing they didn't pocket.

208
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,031
There were military and
employment corruptions.

209
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,100
Instead of sending a boat filled with salt,

210
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,501
they filled it with rocks and made it sink,

211
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,031
and took all that salt for themselves.

212
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,871
They committed such fraud with
the gifts for the King like that.

213
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,241
Among all of this, the crooked loan-sharks...

214
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:24,141
were the ones that made me most upset.

215
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:26,080
They would raise the taxes for farmers...

216
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,810
and lend them the money with
a five percent interest.

217
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:30,180
Their debt will go up with
every breath they take.

218
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:33,820
Their behavior is no better than a gangster.

219
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,590
Your father's memory regarding wealth...

220
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:39,090
is really incredible.

221
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,791
Right, so...

222
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,100
how will you deal with the whistle-blower?

223
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:50,930
Your father is the leading
figure in all of this corruption.

224
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,901
His crimes do not disappear with this.

225
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,511
- However...
- What do you mean by "however"?

226
00:14:57,511 --> 00:15:00,440
Your father is just another one
of the corrupt people to me.

227
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,680
However,

228
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,251
he is your only blood relative.

229
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,861
What if we do this?

230
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,060
They say that upon looking at
one's merits and demerits...

231
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,200
if they have more merits,

232
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,731
it can excuse the demerits.

233
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:22,670
You want him to get more merits?

234
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,070
For example?

235
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,470
For example,

236
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:28,511
he can cooperate in collecting evidence.

237
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,141
It is hard to punish them with
what is in that ledger alone.

238
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,151
In return, you will make sure
to protect the identity...

239
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:39,121
of the whistle-blower.

240
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,651
Of course.

241
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:50,090
Your Majesty. It is time for you
to attend the royal conference.

242
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,600
Okay.

243
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,541
The royal conference?

244
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,981
If you want to incinerate trash,
you have to go to the dump.

245
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:07,881
Unless it's a regency by the king's mother,

246
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:10,450
a woman can't enter the royal conference.

247
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:13,450
I appoint my brother, Prince Yeongpyeong,

248
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,090
as the commissioner of Ijungchung.

249
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,220
- You must not do that.
- You must not do that.

250
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,261
Why is that?

251
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:24,190
The responsibility and work
that is required are too much...

252
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,430
for someone as inexperienced as
Prince Yeongpyeong to handle.

253
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:31,440
In return, there are no powers
that he is connected to.

254
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,271
The biggest virtue to oversee
Ijungchung is just that.

255
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:38,481
Furthermore,

256
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,850
does it look like I am asking
for your permission right now?

257
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:51,891
Gosh, Cheoljong.

258
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,491
I have sent a secret inspector
to the most urgent Yeongnam area.

259
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,060
The crimes of those who
habitually exploit others...

260
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,700
will be punished according to
the letters of the penal code.

261
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,600
And their illegally gathered assets...

262
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,400
will be used to help the people.

263
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:10,810
They will set an example to
all eight of our governors...

264
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,310
and will be forced to turn themselves in.

265
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,310
- We object, Your Majesty.
- We object, Your Majesty.

266
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,120
The Ministry of War has already
dispatched military leaders.

267
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,820
Did you dispatch them without my permission?

268
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,620
Lately,

269
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,931
the heinous incidents caused
by the Donghak believers...

270
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:30,791
resemble political uprisings...

271
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,160
that threatened the sovereignty
of Joseon in the past.

272
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:36,870
So we were in a crisis that
required swift decisions.

273
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,941
I am sure the Border Defense
Council decided however they wanted.

274
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:46,580
The Donghak believers caused a commotion...

275
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,410
and threatened a civil servant.

276
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,781
And in the end, they
injured the civil servant.

277
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:55,650
We had to quickly catch and
execute the leader of the gang.

278
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,421
To prevent a repeat offense,

279
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:00,620
we had to eradicate the source.

280
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:03,130
"Eradicate the source"?

281
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,001
We captured, imprisoned, and punished...

282
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,971
followers and as well
as preachers of Donghak.

283
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:12,201
The problem Joseon faces stems from...

284
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:14,001
a group of thieves!

285
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,011
To truly eradicate the source,

286
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,840
I am letting Samjung Ijungchung
to investigate to help people!

287
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:22,380
As you only sit on your throne,

288
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,110
you do not understand the nature of people.

289
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,751
If we start complying with their
demands, it will never end.

290
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:30,451
We must oppress them with our power...

291
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,221
to ensure they never cause another uprising.

292
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:37,060
- I agree, Your Majesty.
- I agree, Your Majesty.

293
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,340
I will review the prisoners to see...

294
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,140
if any injustices have been
done to innocent people.

295
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,610
Moreover, I will gravely
punish the bandits...

296
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,711
and set an example with them.

297
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,781
I order to punish the governors
and military leaders...

298
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,050
who caused trouble.

299
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,600
He wants to subdue the uprising
with just the penal code.

300
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:24,370
He is so naive.

301
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,810
Before the uprising gets out of control,

302
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,011
I will send down more soldiers
and subdue the Donghak believers.

303
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:34,550
What are you doing?

304
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:37,451
Apply the toner before my face gets dry.

305
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,531
Your Highness, we do not have that anymore.

306
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,231
Should I ask the Queen to bring more toner?

307
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:51,771
I should not.

308
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:53,570
Of course, I should not. Forget I asked.

309
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,441
- You may go.
- Yes, Your Highness.

310
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,291
Is it still difficult for
you to forgive the Queen?

311
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:12,421
Once you read the letters she exchanged...

312
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,360
with the King, you will
not be asking me that.

313
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:16,731
Forgiveness will not resolve this issue.

314
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:19,701
Their love letters were all very silly.

315
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,971
They were willing to sacrifice
their lives for each other.

316
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,921
Is this the reward I get from
being loyal to your family?

317
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:47,021
You framed our family for
everything and banished our family.

318
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:48,291
You branded our family as the rebels...

319
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,531
and ruined our future.

320
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:51,800
How could you just hang us out to dry?

321
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,900
Consider yourselves lucky that
your family was not executed.

322
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:02,211
At least, your family is alive.

323
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,951
Come work at the palace by my side.

324
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:19,991
I will prove to you...

325
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:22,961
that I am different from my father.

326
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,400
Drinks taste the best during the day.

327
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,511
Of course.

328
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,541
Drinks in broad daylight.

329
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,410
This is a shrimp. This is a rare ingredient.

330
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,820
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

331
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:53,191
You are drinking here during the day.

332
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:56,191
What? How dare you speak to me that way?

333
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,531
Who do you think you are?

334
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,800
Let me see.

335
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,741
Yes.

336
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:06,640
I am the secret inspector.

337
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,640
Oh, it is this way.

338
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,521
I heard there are a lot of fake
secret inspectors these days.

339
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,221
I will not fall for your trick.

340
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,021
The horse requisition tablet is not
as powerful as it had been before.

341
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:36,870
Here comes the secret inspector.

342
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,471
Spare me.

343
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:44,041
Nowadays, a rifle works better
than a horse requisition tablet.

344
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,380
Goodness.

345
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,521
We are men. We do not drink
tea and eat refreshments.

346
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,491
I wonder why she wanted to see us.

347
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:03,731
The King is giving us the stick.
And the Queen, the carrot.

348
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,701
Perhaps, that is their plan.

349
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,501
She must want to emphasize
that we are from the same clan.

350
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,400
But it will not work.

351
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,671
We can just play along.

352
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:18,711
- Sure.
- Let us go.

353
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,451
It has been quite some
time since my installation.

354
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:28,820
But I failed to invite my
clan for some refreshments.

355
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,721
I have been very busy lately.

356
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:33,991
Please forgive me.

357
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:41,360
It is not much, but I prepared them for you.

358
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,701
Please enjoy them.

359
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,451
This is alcohol, not tea.

360
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,320
Pretend that it is tea.

361
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,521
The King has declared to reduce
the number of side dishes.

362
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,251
How can his royal subjects
gather around and drink?

363
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,691
If he finds out...

364
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:20,201
But you deceived us, Your Highness.

365
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:23,041
Did you set us up?

366
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,140
- Unbelievable.
- How could she do that?

367
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,110
Stop being so annoying.
You're ruining my mood.

368
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,150
But you annoyed us first.

369
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,620
What? Who do you think we are?

370
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:41,791
I exactly know who you are.

371
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,900
You are the evil of society.

372
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,830
- "Evil"?
- "Evil"?

373
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,011
To put it in your terms, you are
like some plague in this era.

374
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:56,810
- What?
- What?

375
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,340
Why must we endure this kind of criticism?

376
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:00,840
Let us go.

377
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:03,310
Why are you doing this to us?

378
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,521
Good question. I'm glad you asked.

379
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:09,620
You're Chief State Councillor
indeed. You're quite smart.

380
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,751
What...

381
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Why am I doing this, you ask?

382
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,660
I'm trying to tell you not
to get in the King's way.

383
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,171
Whenever you object to the King's idea,

384
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,070
just know that I will start
from the back and get you...

385
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,471
one at a time.

386
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:33,941
Consider yourselves warned.

387
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,021
Unless having a court...

388
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,191
without anyone from our clan is your goal,

389
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:50,291
you should watch out.

390
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,060
You still belong to the Andong Kim clan.

391
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,800
That is why I will change my family name.

392
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,471
From now on, my name is not
Kim So Yong. It's Jang So Yong.

393
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:01,171
- What?
- What on earth...

394
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,380
You must be dense since the clan
helped you get these positions.

395
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,610
Everyone, write this down.

396
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,451
No more objections.

397
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,721
No more appeals. No more conspiring together.

398
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,181
No more going to Oktajeong.

399
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:15,251
Why Oktajeong?

400
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:17,820
Because I can't go.

401
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,870
So the order was executed
without any problems.

402
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,610
The Grand Queen Dowager
took great care of it.

403
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,439
Today, I am here with a request.

404
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,310
Now that you have joined hands with my clan,

405
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,620
do not threaten or do anything
to harm the Queen any longer...

406
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,249
for she, too, belongs to the clan.

407
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:47,160
The King is our enemy.

408
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:52,630
We should not point our swords at
each other only to help our enemy.

409
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,670
Absolutely.

410
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,800
No more shamanic rituals and
talismans. I have quit them all.

411
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:07,310
- Your Highness.
- I must report something to you.

412
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,820
Yes, I should read books
written in that era...

413
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,390
to understand the language of that time.

414
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,130
Gosh, it's so hard to explain
swear words in a friendly manner.

415
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:29,469
What should I read to learn
some new slang words of Joseon?

416
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:32,439
You will not find such
a book at this library.

417
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,969
Then where should I go?

418
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,640
You should refer to those novels...

419
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,779
sold at the general store outside the palace.

420
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,209
What are they about?

421
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:45,880
I've only heard about
them. I've never read them.

422
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,249
I know a few.

423
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,189
One is a story about a dedicated wife...

424
00:27:51,189 --> 00:27:53,019
who dies after her husband betrays her.

425
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,560
Her spirit returns with a beauty
mark right next to her mouth...

426
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,989
to get her revenge.

427
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,800
This story sounds so familiar.

428
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,060
What's the title of this novel?

429
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,499
"Temptation of Wife".

430
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,999
You said you never read them.

431
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,100
I only know the titles.

432
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:11,410
And? Anything else?

433
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,009
This one came out recently.

434
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,640
It's about a noble lady.

435
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,679
Her husband has an affair with
a neighbor's young daughter.

436
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,320
"A World of Married Couple".

437
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,249
Court Lady Choi, why are you getting
so worked up when you never read it?

438
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,560
My apologies.

439
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:31,459
My gosh, all women would feel
the same way about these stories.

440
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:39,199
Why did you do that?

441
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,769
Give us some privacy.

442
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,140
Yes, Your Highness.

443
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:54,620
You need the power of the
clan to ensure your safety.

444
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,120
Why make them turn their backs on you?

445
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,959
I guess you've forgotten the fact...

446
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:01,459
that those old folks tried to kill me.

447
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:03,729
I am working on paving a path...

448
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:05,459
so you can return.

449
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,130
I don't want to return.

450
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:09,969
You see, I went through hoops...

451
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:12,469
to get on the Grand Queen
Dowager's good side.

452
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:14,939
I never had to work this
hard even at the Blue House.

453
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:18,209
But do you know what I got in return?

454
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,709
Poisoned ice.

455
00:29:19,709 --> 00:29:21,850
That was because of the rumors
that the Jo clan had spread.

456
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,749
I told you that I would keep you safe.

457
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,979
Let me be clear.

458
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:28,949
With these things, it's
never good to drag it out.

459
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,390
I do not feel the same way as you do,

460
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,289
and I have no interest
in using your feelings.

461
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:35,860
I am...

462
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,429
already on a different path,

463
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,900
so it'd be best for us
to just go our own way.

464
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,870
But I belong to you, Your Highness.

465
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:55,850
Why the King, of all people?

466
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,120
If he is out of the picture,
I will happily do...

467
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,580
anything you want me to do.
So why does it have to be him?

468
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,729
This has nothing to do with him.

469
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,929
I just have no feelings for you.

470
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,310
Do not let my hand go, So Yong.

471
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,880
You are my everything.

472
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:15,459
You must depict...

473
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,189
everything in detail,
including each strand of hair.

474
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:20,130
And try to see beyond His
Majesty's appearance...

475
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,660
so you can depict his
inner strength and dignity.

476
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,800
Your own style should not come through.

477
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,279
My Queen.

478
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:37,110
Are you concerned about something?

479
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,550
No, not really.

480
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,189
But I feel bad.

481
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,759
My Queen.

482
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,400
What are you doing?

483
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,670
When I smile like this, I sound like a king.

484
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,999
And when I go crossed-eyed,
I sound like a eunuch.

485
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,279
Is this not funny?

486
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:11,249
I find it extremely
difficult to make you laugh.

487
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,679
Well, then...

488
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,350
When I hunch down like this,
I sound like a servant.

489
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,920
And when I stand tall,
I sound like a warrior.

490
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,390
Is this not funny?

491
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,130
You laughed.

492
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,370
Your Majesty.

493
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:36,009
- Please return to your pose.
- Right.

494
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,739
I will make you laugh again later.

495
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,080
By the way, what's with this
portrait out of the blue?

496
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,350
According to the rule of Jo and Jong,

497
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,650
King Sunjong will receive
the honorable title of Sunjo,

498
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,219
which means I will also be revered,

499
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:54,759
so I wanted to commemorate it.

500
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:57,160
The rule of Jo and Jong...

501
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,660
Gosh, I know I've heard of it.

502
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:02,269
When deciding on a king's posthumous title,

503
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:04,729
"Jo" is used for those who
made great contributions,

504
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:07,199
and "Jong" is used for those
praised for their virtue.

505
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,740
Right, I remember now.

506
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:17,780
Your Highness, here is what you asked for.

507
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,349
Let's see.

508
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,130
This looks great.

509
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,099
Do you wish to learn swordsmanship?

510
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,729
I am a great swordsman.

511
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,470
I don't even need to learn it.

512
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,599
When it comes to knives, I'm already a pro.

513
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,769
This is a gift for someone special.

514
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,880
"Someone special"?

515
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:10,599
Is it my turn?

516
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,439
So you've been waiting for this?

517
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,070
Oh, I'm sorry.

518
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,510
You've been ousted,

519
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,039
so I wasn't sure whether or
not I should bother with you.

520
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:21,180
That is funny.

521
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,950
You suggested forming an alliance...

522
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,619
but left without even saying goodbye.

523
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,920
You have clearly failed to keep
your husband under your control.

524
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,820
Is that why you could not ensure my safety?

525
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,260
You see, I had a plan.

526
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,229
Until you messed with me, that is.

527
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,430
What kind of plan?

528
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,970
I had planned to live a safe, boring life.

529
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,869
Unsheathe the sword.

530
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:52,510
I do not fight with women.

531
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:57,680
I got it as a gift for you, in
place of a retirement ceremony.

532
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,289
All your achievements are
engraved on the blade,

533
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,519
so have a look.

534
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:17,229
That's the life you've led.

535
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:20,570
You said I wouldn't be able...

536
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:24,610
to do anything even though I'm
the Queen because I'm a woman.

537
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,479
Just wait and see. I'll show
you what I'm capable of.

538
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,320
I won't filter what I say,
and I'll be unstoppable...

539
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,180
because I've got nothing to lose now.

540
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Your Majesty, Royal Noble
Consort Eui is here.

541
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:56,639
She may enter.

542
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,260
How are you feeling?

543
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:18,059
I have sorted out my thoughts
as I practiced archery.

544
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:19,829
And I found some peace.

545
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,130
I am glad to hear that.

546
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,099
It is late, but you still
have a lot of work left.

547
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,139
It is not enough to concern you.

548
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,349
DONGMONGSEONSEUP

549
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,329
Had I known you would cherish
this book as much as you do now,

550
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,499
I should have tried to keep it cleaner.

551
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:56,930
Look at these scribbles.

552
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:07,539
You seem busy. I have taken
too much of your time.

553
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:08,639
I will get going now.

554
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,280
My Consort.

555
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,820
There is something I have not told you yet.

556
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,729
I did not fancy you...

557
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:27,459
just because we met at the well...

558
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:29,430
eight years ago.

559
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,639
When I returned to Hanyang and met you,

560
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:35,269
I liked you then.

561
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,809
Your Majesty, Prince Yeongpyeong is here.

562
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,749
I did not know you were here.

563
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,289
I was just about to leave.

564
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,189
I will leave you be.

565
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,409
What did you talk about?

566
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,340
Looking away from the truth
no one wants to expose...

567
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:18,709
must be the right thing to do.

568
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,409
Look at his passionate eyes.

569
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,889
He's such an enthusiast of social science.

570
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,889
You've been waiting for my class all day.

571
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:06,130
Well, I do not believe
you, but you can tell me...

572
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,900
your stories about the
future like last night.

573
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,970
Here's today's topic.

574
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,490
Constitutional monarchy.

575
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,320
"Constitutional monarchy"?

576
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:34,689
There are monarchs, but they
do not govern over people.

577
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,099
The sovereignty still exists,
but the people have the power.

578
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,499
There's a country called Bhutan.

579
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,630
That is such a strange name.

580
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:48,670
There's a king named Jigme Khesar
which sounds even more unfamiliar.

581
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,439
This country used to follow an
absolute monarchy like Joseon.

582
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,110
But he changed it to a
constitutional monarchy.

583
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,610
Why?

584
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,849
He was afraid that a tyrannical
ruler might rise to the throne...

585
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:59,280
and ruin the country someday.

586
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,180
So he constitutionalized the country first.

587
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,090
And he rules over the
country based on the law.

588
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,260
So the kingship is just a symbol.

589
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:09,189
King Jigme Khesar is wise.

590
00:40:10,229 --> 00:40:12,499
Which Chinese letter does he use for "Ji"?

591
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:33,450
We should go home now.

592
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:35,789
Home?

593
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:37,920
Where is that?

594
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,189
My goodness. My friend, you had one too many.

595
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,630
You cannot remember where your house is.

596
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:47,030
Okay. You know what? This is it for me.

597
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,200
I must go back home and get some rest.

598
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,740
I do not have a home.

599
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,150
I have nothing.

600
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,349
I neither have a place
to go nor own anything.

601
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:15,990
I have nothing now.

602
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,579
I did not fancy you just
because we met at the well...

603
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,510
eight years ago.

604
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,320
No.

605
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:43,789
There is no way he knows the truth.

606
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,099
You cannot enter now, Your Highness.

607
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,599
I must see His Majesty now.

608
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,200
Well...

609
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:08,939
Your Majesty, it is Hwa Jin.

610
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,920
So you want me to complete...

611
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,220
the book on tactics with the Queen...

612
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,260
who is pretending to be a man.

613
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:57,030
Great.

614
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:00,229
Cast away your prejudices.

615
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,659
She is devising to create
an original weapon...

616
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,499
no one has seen or heard of.

617
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,570
Well, then. Let us hear it.

618
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,880
Before we do that, I have a killer
method of training soldiers.

619
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,840
Why don't I start with that?

620
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,050
"A killer method"?

621
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,420
1, 2, 3.

622
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:24,720
Seven.

623
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,260
I can't even hear you. Is
that the best you can do?

624
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,189
Okay. I got it. Let us talk about the weapon.

625
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,999
This is only the 8th session.
There are 14 training sessions.

626
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,099
You will not say the last number.

627
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,869
If you do, you will start over.

628
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:45,570
1, 2, 3...

629
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:46,909
Six.

630
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:48,979
1, 2, 3...

631
00:43:48,979 --> 00:43:50,909
- Keep your gaze straight.
- Seven.

632
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,619
It is dangerous to let her
in on our military strategy.

633
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,820
The Queen declared war on her clan.

634
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:00,389
She does not need to prove
that she is on our side now.

635
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,189
Your Highness.

636
00:44:04,189 --> 00:44:06,860
- Raise your legs.
- 2, 3.

637
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,499
- Eight.
- Gosh.

638
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,769
Eight was the last number.

639
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:13,099
Start over.

640
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:14,869
Wait. You said this was a "killer" method.

641
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:16,510
Will this end when I die?

642
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,209
Start over now.

643
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:20,010
- Hurry.
- One.

644
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,280
Your Highness.

645
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,130
Because you're slowly turning
into a monster every day,

646
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,599
without even realizing it.

647
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:53,709
This fake record...

648
00:44:53,709 --> 00:44:56,010
is enough to bring down Left State Councilor.

649
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:59,209
- I want you to get him now.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

650
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,050
Your Majesty, Royal Noble
Consort Eui is here.

651
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,990
Let her in.

652
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:20,400
I have something to tell you.

653
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,939
Prince Yeongpyeong, could
you leave us be for a moment?

654
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:28,639
- Your Highness.
- Please.

655
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,889
You have been talking to the
Queen in the evening lately.

656
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:44,990
May I ask what you discussed with her?

657
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,900
We talked about the future
of Joseon I dream of.

658
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,099
I thought I would be the one whom
you would share your dreams with.

659
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,599
When the Queen has won you over,

660
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,139
all I have done is being swayed by falsehood.

661
00:46:02,909 --> 00:46:05,010
I will not be swayed any longer.

662
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,780
The owner of Dongmongseonseup...

663
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:11,889
is not me.

664
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:18,689
You already knew this.

665
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:22,200
Then why did you not say anything?

666
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,570
Because it would not change anything.

667
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,740
Why would it not change anything?

668
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:31,240
You no longer have any trust in me.

669
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:36,010
The way you look at me is no longer the same.

670
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,809
Just because of a single lie,

671
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,119
the time that I have spent
with you does not disappear.

672
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:46,019
The fact that I loved you for two years...

673
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:48,320
does not change.

674
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:50,689
I am sure you pretended
not to know for my benefit.

675
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,829
That is the type of person you are.

676
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,369
Just because you looked at me and
pretended not to know anything,

677
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,740
did you think that would make me happy?

678
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,709
- Hwa Jin.
- I defamed the Queen.

679
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,409
I...

680
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:10,249
found the ledger in Great
Lord Yeongeun's home...

681
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:11,950
and gave it to the Queen Dowager.

682
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,619
Why would you...

683
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:17,550
It is because...

684
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:20,990
I hated the Queen.

685
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,329
Despite seeing that ledger,

686
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:27,159
were you unaware that it
was something that I needed?

687
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:28,800
I knew it, but I did it anyway.

688
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:33,470
How could you do this to me?

689
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:36,840
You knew about my dream
better than anyone else.

690
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:39,639
You stepped on my dream.

691
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:40,909
My dream...

692
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,880
My dream was you.

693
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:48,920
However, your heart started
to move towards the Queen.

694
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:52,420
You tried your best for my sake,

695
00:47:53,189 --> 00:47:55,920
but I could see how you could
not help but be drawn to her.

696
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:00,360
That made me more miserable.

697
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:05,470
That is how I lost myself.

698
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,720
It is my fault.

699
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,490
I made you like this.

700
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,689
It is my fault.

701
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,059
I should not have loved
without taking care of myself.

702
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,329
I will go...

703
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:41,400
find myself now.

704
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,619
"A WORLD OF MARRIED COUPLE 1"

705
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:58,490
That nasty lord!

706
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:00,720
Give me the next one.

707
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:03,189
"A WORLD OF MARRIED COUPLE 2"

708
00:49:05,459 --> 00:49:09,930
Your Highness. Are you not going
to Huijeongjeon Hall tonight?

709
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,999
Should I just skip tonight?

710
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,039
My Cheoljong will be desperately
waiting for me to come.

711
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:24,650
I had no idea that I would have the
soul of an educator inside me too.

712
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,119
Let me read one more page first.

713
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,400
KIM SO YONG

714
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,999
Hey, Jong. I'm really sorry. I
meant to read just one more page,

715
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:49,499
but I couldn't stop.

716
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,709
Why haven't you gotten changed yet?

717
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,490
What? Why are you giving this to me?

718
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:08,720
Did you not say to return this
to you if I wanted to live?

719
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:19,329
You can hurt someone by
not knowing the truth.

720
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,369
It took too long...

721
00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:24,809
for me to return this to its owner.

722
00:50:34,249 --> 00:50:35,680
I am sorry...

723
00:50:36,889 --> 00:50:38,550
for not recognizing you.

724
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,720
It's the same for me.

725
00:50:44,189 --> 00:50:46,659
I wasn't honest with you
for a very long time too.

726
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:51,229
It came back to its rightful
owner after eight years.

727
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:55,139
We cannot turn back all of
our missed opportunities.

728
00:50:57,409 --> 00:50:58,970
However,

729
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,209
I will never misunderstand you or
confuse you with another again.

730
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,590
But what happened to you...

731
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:15,659
during the past eight years?

732
00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:20,800
You seemed a bit strange then,
but you were not this strange.

733
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,229
Did I miss something?

734
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,599
Good question.

735
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:44,764
It looks good. Although
I don't know what it is.

736
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,264
It is medicine.

737
00:51:49,503 --> 00:51:51,704
Anything that you eat in secret must be good.

738
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:54,844
Yogurt?

739
00:51:56,344 --> 00:51:58,373
- This smells like liquor.
- My gosh.

740
00:51:59,643 --> 00:52:00,914
It is called pear blossom wine.

741
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:03,043
It is a liquor you make when
the pear blossoms bloom...

742
00:52:03,043 --> 00:52:06,824
and drink when the scent
of pear blossoms spread.

743
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,983
Can you give me a glass?

744
00:52:09,154 --> 00:52:10,654
I just had the last of it.

745
00:52:10,654 --> 00:52:13,664
It takes a lot of effort to
make, so I have been saving it.

746
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,164
- But because of you...
- Gosh.

747
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,733
How do you make this?

748
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:23,304
First, make a dough by adding
water to nonglutinous rice powder.

749
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:26,034
Then you flatten the dough
and make a hole in the middle.

750
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:27,804
Then you place it to the die.

751
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:31,344
It looks like a donut.

752
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:35,684
Continue.

753
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:38,954
Anyways, cook it in hot water, take it out,

754
00:52:38,954 --> 00:52:41,083
mash it, and let it cool.

755
00:52:41,884 --> 00:52:44,824
take pear blossoms and the
yeast you prepared in advance...

756
00:52:44,824 --> 00:52:46,563
and make a dough again.

757
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:50,594
Then you put it in a liquor
jug and cover the lid.

758
00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:52,963
After three days have passed...

759
00:52:52,963 --> 00:52:54,103
Do you drink it then?

760
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:57,974
Of course not.

761
00:52:58,434 --> 00:53:01,673
You stir it up.

762
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:03,474
Then after 20 days,

763
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,114
that is when you can drink it.

764
00:53:08,614 --> 00:53:10,213
Time, please pass quickly.

765
00:53:10,884 --> 00:53:12,614
Please ripen quickly.

766
00:53:18,324 --> 00:53:19,893
Left State Councilor Kim Seok Geun...

767
00:53:19,893 --> 00:53:21,463
is guilty of colluding with local leaders...

768
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:25,164
to exploit farmers and alter
records for personal gain.

769
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:26,764
He will be stripped of
his government position,

770
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:28,364
and all of his assets will be confiscated,

771
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:30,574
and be charged for theft.

772
00:53:30,804 --> 00:53:32,404
How dare you!

773
00:53:34,974 --> 00:53:37,443
Let go of me. I said let go!

774
00:53:37,844 --> 00:53:39,713
Let go of me!

775
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:42,443
Let go of me!

776
00:53:47,623 --> 00:53:51,123
I had no idea that the
Queen's warning would be real.

777
00:53:52,324 --> 00:53:54,364
As the seat for Left
State Councilor is empty,

778
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,994
I appoint Consort Min's father,

779
00:53:56,994 --> 00:53:59,293
Lord Min Woo Jin of the Yeoheung Min clan.

780
00:53:59,293 --> 00:54:01,103
We object, Your Majesty.

781
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:03,603
- We object, Your Majesty.
- We object, Your Majesty.

782
00:54:18,454 --> 00:54:19,884
There is no need to sit.

783
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:23,423
When will my regency be resumed?

784
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:26,664
It must be done before the King ruins Joseon.

785
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:30,034
We will no longer lose
our family's positions.

786
00:54:30,594 --> 00:54:32,693
Furthermore, we have begun
organizing the military,

787
00:54:32,893 --> 00:54:35,164
so it will not be long
before the fall of the King.

788
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:36,434
Hurry.

789
00:54:36,434 --> 00:54:38,704
I am not that patient.

790
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:40,074
Yes, Your Highness.

791
00:54:40,574 --> 00:54:44,173
However, I heard something strange.

792
00:54:45,713 --> 00:54:49,244
That the Queen is teaching
the King blasphemous ideals.

793
00:55:02,793 --> 00:55:03,864
I WENT OUT ON A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.

794
00:55:03,864 --> 00:55:04,934
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT SHINES
ON THE DARK SKY AT NIGHT.

795
00:55:13,003 --> 00:55:14,304
DONGMONGSEONSEUP

796
00:55:19,474 --> 00:55:21,614
KIM SO YONG

797
00:55:21,614 --> 00:55:23,213
She still has this book?

798
00:55:45,704 --> 00:55:47,244
Are they all believers of Donghak?

799
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:48,804
Yes, sir.

800
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:52,713
- Come here!
- Mommy!

801
00:55:52,713 --> 00:55:55,114
Why are you taking that little child?

802
00:55:55,414 --> 00:55:57,583
Seon! Seon!

803
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:04,994
Do you recognize this handwriting?

804
00:56:14,463 --> 00:56:17,074
This is a secret code that
Donghak believers use.

805
00:56:23,273 --> 00:56:25,643
War is all about what kinds of items
you can bring to the battlefield.

806
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:26,943
"Items"? What does that mean?

807
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:28,543
Is this some kind of proverb?

808
00:56:28,884 --> 00:56:31,784
A grenade may be more
effective than 10 soldiers.

809
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:34,154
It sounds like you are just making it up.

810
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:35,184
Oh, right.

811
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:38,324
I just remembered there
are 15 training sessions.

812
00:56:38,494 --> 00:56:41,664
That name sounds very credible, "grenade".

813
00:56:44,264 --> 00:56:46,693
If you put some gunpowder in a
pouch like this and throw it,

814
00:56:46,693 --> 00:56:49,164
it'll explode like this.

815
00:56:50,103 --> 00:56:51,333
We already have that.

816
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,273
The Flying Thunderbolt.

817
00:56:53,873 --> 00:56:56,543
Really? Then what about bulletproof suits?

818
00:56:57,474 --> 00:56:58,914
Clothes that protect you from bullets?

819
00:56:59,313 --> 00:57:00,713
You mean, the armor?

820
00:57:01,244 --> 00:57:03,384
No, it's worn inside the armor.

821
00:57:04,784 --> 00:57:05,853
Oh, I see.

822
00:57:07,454 --> 00:57:08,853
Special Director Hong!

823
00:57:10,554 --> 00:57:13,353
I was just passing by but
noticed that your lights were on.

824
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,423
Oh, good to see you.

825
00:57:17,164 --> 00:57:20,304
Hey, look at you having fun without me.

826
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,503
I can't believe you invited
these two but not me.

827
00:57:27,074 --> 00:57:28,244
- Oh, boy.
- My gosh!

828
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:29,974
Lee Saeng Mang!

829
00:57:30,574 --> 00:57:32,614
You are alive!

830
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:37,114
I was so worried about you.

831
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:40,684
Finally, we meet again. Finally!

832
00:57:42,853 --> 00:57:45,193
Oh, it's good to see you indeed.

833
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:47,623
You never went back to Oktajeong after that?

834
00:57:47,623 --> 00:57:49,123
I drank gallons of wine...

835
00:57:49,123 --> 00:57:52,333
at Oktajeong all by myself
hoping to run into you there.

836
00:57:52,864 --> 00:57:54,134
Lee Saeng Mang!

837
00:58:00,003 --> 00:58:03,103
Hands off. Will you identify yourself first?

838
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:05,344
Who are you?

839
00:58:05,514 --> 00:58:09,083
I am Lee Saeng Mang's close friend.

840
00:58:09,943 --> 00:58:12,083
"Friend"? I am...

841
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:14,983
- Do not...
- I am...

842
00:58:16,554 --> 00:58:19,054
Hold on. You look familiar for some reason.

843
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:22,923
Meet my buddy, Jong Cheol.

844
00:58:23,164 --> 00:58:24,233
What? Why...

845
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:26,934
If you're not Jong Cheol, then who are you?

846
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:28,704
I am Jong Cheol.

847
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:35,474
Nice! I won!

848
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:40,443
What kind of life must one
have led to be so good at this?

849
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:43,784
Let's just say, I wasted my entire youth.

850
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:45,983
You sure are my friend.

851
00:58:46,284 --> 00:58:48,353
We are so much alike.

852
00:58:48,353 --> 00:58:51,293
Gosh, this looks like a lucky spot.

853
00:58:51,724 --> 00:58:53,693
Are you hiding a few cards somewhere?

854
00:58:54,023 --> 00:58:56,494
It's not easy to get that
trump card, you know.

855
00:58:56,494 --> 00:58:57,934
Blame your lack of luck,

856
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,594
not my good fortune.

857
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:01,563
All right, let us play another round.

858
00:59:01,934 --> 00:59:04,074
The losers will make the
winner's wish come true.

859
00:59:07,804 --> 00:59:09,543
Hey, watch your hat.

860
00:59:10,443 --> 00:59:11,574
The insider.

861
00:59:14,713 --> 00:59:15,744
The outsider.

862
00:59:17,614 --> 00:59:20,114
And there are people like me,
who stick to their beliefs.

863
00:59:20,784 --> 00:59:22,253
What a combination.

864
00:59:39,634 --> 00:59:40,873
Let me help you...

865
00:59:45,074 --> 00:59:46,614
All that neolttwigi taught me that skill.

866
00:59:49,713 --> 00:59:51,184
She sure is the winner.

867
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:17,974
I cannot believe they used
such detailed evidence...

868
01:00:17,974 --> 01:00:20,244
to oust the Left State Councilor.

869
01:00:21,813 --> 01:00:26,284
This means... I am certain they
got their hands on the ledger.

870
01:00:27,554 --> 01:00:29,684
Then the real war begins now.

871
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:31,253
What?

872
01:00:32,654 --> 01:00:35,293
We shall begin the cleanup
operation expecting a bloodbath.

873
01:00:36,594 --> 01:00:38,563
If you do not wish to be bogged down by this,

874
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:42,704
give up your greed and be
ready to shed some blood.

875
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:44,873
"Shed some blood"?

876
01:00:46,804 --> 01:00:49,273
Those who accepted bribes for
giving out government jobs...

877
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:51,474
shall resign voluntarily.

878
01:00:53,043 --> 01:00:54,313
If you accumulated wealth
through the grains...

879
01:00:54,313 --> 01:00:55,543
and gifts from the people,

880
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:56,844
return them to where they belong.

881
01:00:58,313 --> 01:01:00,313
And you must take care of those...

882
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:04,623
who manipulated any records for
you and know the situation well.

883
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:05,623
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

884
01:01:05,623 --> 01:01:06,693
If...

885
01:01:08,724 --> 01:01:11,733
any of us gets caught because
the cleanup is not done properly,

886
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:15,833
that person will take the fall.

887
01:01:20,574 --> 01:01:22,673
Even without the Andong Kim clan,

888
01:01:22,673 --> 01:01:24,713
Kim Byeong In's influence
only keeps on growing.

889
01:01:25,344 --> 01:01:27,643
I feel as though we are at a standstill.

890
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,713
We must dig up dirt on Kim Byeong In.

891
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:33,054
It looks like he helped some people
obtain positions in the government,

892
01:01:33,054 --> 01:01:36,224
but we can only get him locked up
if he received something in return.

893
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:39,724
It does not look like this jerk
received anything from them.

894
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:44,864
And those who received such help from him...

895
01:01:44,864 --> 01:01:46,434
are incredibly loyal to him,

896
01:01:47,364 --> 01:01:48,934
so we can't win them over to our side.

897
01:01:48,934 --> 01:01:51,204
It seems that he has built
an invincible fortress.

898
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:01,713
You lads are already here.

899
01:02:03,914 --> 01:02:05,313
Lee Saeng Mang is not here yet?

900
01:02:06,554 --> 01:02:07,623
Oh, hold on.

901
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:11,023
I have to say, he is very diligent.

902
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:13,594
He comes here every day
to play tujeon with us.

903
01:02:17,463 --> 01:02:18,994
Do you not have a job?

904
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,603
This is my job.

905
01:02:21,134 --> 01:02:22,963
How can this be called a job?

906
01:02:23,764 --> 01:02:25,634
Hey, I asked you a question.

907
01:02:42,654 --> 01:02:46,824
Today, I feel like you're mine

908
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:51,134
But you're not mine

909
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,904
Oh, hello.

910
01:03:35,943 --> 01:03:41,614
I came to complain about the Queen.

911
01:03:41,614 --> 01:03:43,143
Oh, me too.

912
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,784
Well, you can go first.

913
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:48,224
Okay.

914
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:54,293
Your Highness!

915
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:58,764
Stop making me so angry!

916
01:04:04,304 --> 01:04:08,103
If you keep it up, you'll
fall into a bucket of manure!

917
01:04:10,844 --> 01:04:11,914
Oh, dear.

918
01:04:12,773 --> 01:04:15,384
It's rare to meet someone who
can swear better than I can.

919
01:04:15,784 --> 01:04:18,384
But let me give you some advice.
If you shout from here...

920
01:04:19,753 --> 01:04:21,154
My gosh.

921
01:04:22,923 --> 01:04:25,324
- Well, I should warm up too.
- Okay.

922
01:04:27,324 --> 01:04:30,224
You piece of... You drive me bonkers.

923
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:36,333
I shall teach you a lesson!

924
01:04:41,404 --> 01:04:42,404
My gosh.

925
01:04:45,474 --> 01:04:47,443
- How about we do it together?
- Sure.

926
01:04:49,614 --> 01:04:51,583
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

927
01:05:10,404 --> 01:05:13,074
I love you, pear blossom wine!

928
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:15,603
Pear blossom wine, you're a thing of beauty!

929
01:05:17,373 --> 01:05:19,173
All right.

930
01:05:19,173 --> 01:05:20,614
You two should try this too.

931
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:23,213
Just a little taste. Here.

932
01:05:26,753 --> 01:05:27,824
Here, you too.

933
01:05:28,983 --> 01:05:30,954
What a beautiful color, Your Highness.

934
01:05:31,324 --> 01:05:33,193
And it has such a delectable aroma.

935
01:05:34,494 --> 01:05:36,893
It's ripe. It's aged perfectly.

936
01:05:37,793 --> 01:05:41,103
You two, what have you been up
to that you've lost your voices?

937
01:05:47,204 --> 01:05:48,503
Let's see.

938
01:05:51,244 --> 01:05:53,143
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness.

939
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:54,784
Is it because I haven't eaten anything?

940
01:05:55,983 --> 01:06:01,353
Then this will be my dessert!

941
01:06:01,884 --> 01:06:04,494
See you again, pear blossom wine!

942
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:07,893
My beautiful pear blossom wine!

943
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:12,293
My pear blossom wine.

944
01:06:13,293 --> 01:06:16,133
I ran here because I wanted
to give you this in person.

945
01:06:16,633 --> 01:06:18,374
The book is finally ready.

946
01:06:25,044 --> 01:06:26,244
"Ubiyoram"?

947
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:28,143
Nice title.

948
01:06:28,313 --> 01:06:29,614
All thanks to you.

949
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:32,754
All I did was tell you what I saw.

950
01:06:34,983 --> 01:06:36,284
On the next page...

951
01:06:37,424 --> 01:06:38,624
That day, Special Director Hong...

952
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:43,924
He wets his pants whenever
he sees these drawings.

953
01:06:45,263 --> 01:06:47,263
My gosh, these drawings look awesome.

954
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:52,633
My Queen.

955
01:06:54,574 --> 01:06:56,004
Are you not lonely?

956
01:06:59,773 --> 01:07:02,443
I lived as a commoner only for
a short while, but I still...

957
01:07:03,343 --> 01:07:05,214
battled with loneliness...

958
01:07:05,214 --> 01:07:07,053
and had a hard time adjusting
when I first got here.

959
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,853
Since you are so different,
you must feel very lonely here.

960
01:07:12,494 --> 01:07:13,954
I am truly worried.

961
01:07:14,693 --> 01:07:16,464
I don't have time to be lonely.

962
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:19,233
Predicaments await me every day,
and I'm busy running around.

963
01:07:30,174 --> 01:07:33,214
Someone even made a dictionary
to understand me better.

964
01:07:33,813 --> 01:07:35,784
Thanks to him, I don't feel lonely at all.

965
01:07:49,393 --> 01:07:50,723
Is this finally the noodle moment?

966
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:56,303
Shall I say it or not?

967
01:07:56,664 --> 01:07:57,803
Gosh!

968
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:05,273
That wasn't intentional.
I've been feeling queasy...

969
01:08:08,313 --> 01:08:11,483
Bring the royal physician at once.

970
01:08:44,784 --> 01:08:46,183
Is it something serious?

971
01:08:49,454 --> 01:08:51,154
Her Highness is pregnant.

972
01:08:54,124 --> 01:08:55,523
What? "Pregnant"?

973
01:08:58,364 --> 01:08:59,534
I'm pregnant?

974
01:09:03,263 --> 01:09:05,773
Congratulations, Your Highness.

975
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:13,574
My Queen, thank you.

976
01:09:22,483 --> 01:09:25,654
- Congratulations, Your Highness!
- Congratulations, Your Highness!

977
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,563
I am becoming a father!

978
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,683
I'm...

979
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:56,784
pregnant?

980
01:10:01,494 --> 01:10:05,763
MR. QUEEN

981
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:27,824
<i>I'm pregnant?</i>

982
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:30,954
<i>The real prenatal education begins today.</i>

983
01:10:30,954 --> 01:10:33,794
<i>You must stay away from such unusual tastes.</i>

984
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:36,693
<i>I assume you spread the
rumors as I told you to?</i>

985
01:10:36,693 --> 01:10:38,294
<i>They did not actually
spend the night together.</i>

986
01:10:38,294 --> 01:10:40,464
<i>What is with this pose? This is embarrassing.</i>

987
01:10:40,464 --> 01:10:42,334
<i>This isn't enough to quell the rumors.</i>

988
01:10:42,334 --> 01:10:43,763
<i>If you say so...</i>

989
01:10:43,834 --> 01:10:46,074
<i>What everyone believes becomes the truth.</i>

990
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:48,603
<i>Bring the Queen's head to me at once.</i>

991
01:10:48,603 --> 01:10:49,973
<i>This is an order.</i>

992
01:10:49,973 --> 01:10:52,244
<i>If I wish to live, everyone
around me will die.</i>

993
01:10:52,244 --> 01:10:53,843
<i>Hence, I will embrace everything.</i>
