EPISODE 19

4
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:00,911
Who are you?

5
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,711
What on earth have you done to So Yong?

6
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:17,392
Let go of me!

7
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,862
If you do not want to die, answer me.

8
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:23,362
I didn't do anything.

9
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:25,931
I just opened my eyes, and
I was in this woman's body.

10
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:31,601
Where is the real So Yong?

11
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:32,842
I don't know either.

12
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,612
I don't know if she's dead or alive.

13
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,651
I am going to kill you.

14
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,332
Byeong In.

15
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,331
How long were you inside So Yong's body?

16
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,932
Ever since the day I woke up
after I fell into the lake.

17
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:40,812
You said you knew everything
about So Yong and me.

18
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:44,742
I could suddenly read all her memories.

19
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,081
I found you.

20
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,571
Get up...

21
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:16,041
if you do not want to die here.

22
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,622
Join hands with me, just until
you can get out of this unscathed.

23
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:27,592
- What are you up to?
- If such memories are intact,

24
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,092
So Yong is still alive inside you.

25
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:36,761
So stay alive.

26
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,331
You must stay alive.

27
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,641
I knew it.

28
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,381
The woman that you are in love with...

29
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,592
Stop what you are doing.

30
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,592
I do not wish to hurt you,
so get out of our way.

31
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,492
You are so full of yourself!

32
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:20,672
Get them!

33
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:22,542
The Minister of War has gone against orders!

34
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,982
From now on, you will follow my orders!

35
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:25,982
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

36
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,052
You're bleeding too much.

37
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:47,122
We need to stop it.

38
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:04,802
What is this?

39
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:08,042
It is a letter plotting treason.

40
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,781
Protect yourself with this.

41
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:22,492
Do you remember playing
hide-and-seek when we were young?

42
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,192
I will give you until the count of 10,

43
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:26,692
so run away and hide.

44
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,162
Come with me.

45
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,802
He is coming after us.

46
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:41,042
It is meaningless.

47
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,182
Go.

48
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,451
Do not look back no matter what.

49
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:50,182
No.

50
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:55,821
Save So Yong.

51
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,062
Hurry.

52
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,641
I said you have until the count of 10.

53
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:34,461
1, 2, 3...

54
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,341
5, 6...

55
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:04,591
Who sent you here?

56
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:06,721
Who else?

57
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:08,632
It was your father.

58
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,481
9, 10.

59
00:09:57,611 --> 00:10:00,282
I told you not to look back.

60
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,662
Go after the Queen!

61
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:37,682
Byeong In.

62
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,692
Come here. We should walk together.

63
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:48,861
I am going to put it in my hair when
I meet the King for the first time.

64
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,632
Can you help me choose one?

65
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:53,402
It does not need to be fancy,

66
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,601
but I want the design to be special.

67
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,371
Look forward...

68
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:20,831
I...

69
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,231
always looked at you.

70
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,871
I even saw the side of you...

71
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,912
that you did not know about.

72
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,882
Why...

73
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,491
Why did I...

74
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:53,221
not recognize it?

75
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:48,081
She could not have gotten too far. Find her!

76
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,172
Where did she go?

77
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:13,471
Look everywhere for her!

78
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:14,642
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,221
Over there!

80
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,552
What can I do with this
thing when I'm all by myself?

81
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,221
I don't even know where I am now.

82
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,591
What can I actually do here?

83
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:18,902
I couldn't do anything when
everyone died right before my eyes!

84
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:20,461
Nothing!

85
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,071
It's over.

86
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:31,481
No matter how hard people try,

87
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:36,812
some things aren't meant to happen.

88
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:54,532
Fine. Take me.

89
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,672
It's all over anyway.

90
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:34,871
EPISODE 19, THE MAN WHO
CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD

91
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:39,481
My Queen.

92
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,152
You were alive.

93
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:44,782
I am glad.

94
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:47,351
I am so glad.

95
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:06,172
We are okay now.

96
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,471
You are alive, so we will be okay.

97
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:11,741
That is all I need.

98
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:15,082
Everyone died.

99
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,152
Court Lady Choi,

100
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:20,951
Hong Yeon, and Kim Byeong In.

101
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:24,122
Everyone died.

102
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:27,791
Kim Byeong In died?

103
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,632
He died because of me.

104
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:33,801
Everyone died all because of me.

105
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:37,801
Calm down.

106
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,201
My Queen, calm down.

107
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,612
Hong Yeon and Court Lady Choi...

108
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,142
are fine.

109
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:53,221
Your Highness!

110
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:55,021
Hong Yeon!

111
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:02,662
Your Highness.

112
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:04,362
Are you okay?

113
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:06,531
I'm okay. What about Court Lady Choi?

114
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,132
Your Highness!

115
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:10,471
Court Lady Choi.

116
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,241
- Oh, no. Court Lady Choi.
- Your Highness.

117
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:20,112
It is as I expected. It is
dangerous to be outside the palace.

118
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:22,582
It must hurt a lot.

119
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:24,582
It hurts like crazy.

120
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:27,152
Oh, no.

121
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:28,192
Goodness.

122
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,951
But do not worry...

123
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,592
because it means that I am not dying.

124
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,261
If this were a critical injury, I
would not even have felt the pain.

125
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:39,061
But he swung his sword at you.

126
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:41,332
Well, should we say that I was lucky?

127
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:43,132
Back off!

128
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:50,172
And he was a lousy swordsman,
so that helped too.

129
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:59,622
I really thought something
happened to you two!

130
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:02,751
Your Highness.

131
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:06,221
Your Highness.

132
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:08,531
I am so sorry. Oh, no.

133
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:09,632
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

134
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:10,892
I am sorry.

135
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,672
But where were you, Your Highness?

136
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:18,201
I was also out looking for you.

137
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,642
But I could not find you.

138
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:23,342
Many people went out to find you.

139
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:27,311
But the man who found you is the King.

140
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:45,461
- Your Highness.
- We missed you.

141
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:49,902
I am so glad that you are safe.

142
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,142
My goodness.

143
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:53,971
Oh, my.

144
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:09,021
I must wipe that.

145
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:18,902
You are pregnant.

146
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,031
Why did you come all the way here?

147
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,001
You wouldn't return for days.

148
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:26,301
So I came out to greet you.

149
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:29,011
You always surprise me.

150
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:30,942
I had no choice.

151
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:33,682
Because without you at the palace,

152
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:39,622
it felt like a blackout.

153
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,892
Everywhere I turned was dark.

154
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:46,862
Well,

155
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:48,862
let me explain what a blackout is.

156
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:51,531
You do not have to explain
it. I know how you feel.

157
00:20:53,731 --> 00:20:55,332
I felt the same way.

158
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:00,072
I missed you.

159
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:03,842
The pain in my heart was greater...

160
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:05,541
than the pain my body felt from the injuries.

161
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:15,422
I will never leave you alone, My Queen.

162
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,162
I am sorry.

163
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:18,057
- Is your injury serious?
- I am okay.

164
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:21,997
I will be as good as new with some medicine.

165
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:44,247
Did you figure out the
group that attacked you?

166
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,987
I saw a very familiar face.

167
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:03,267
These are Donghak believers!

168
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,787
I saw the King.

169
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:38,537
THE KING IS NOT DEAD.

170
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:42,047
THE KING IS NOT DEAD.

171
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:45,777
Wait.

172
00:23:46,317 --> 00:23:48,186
The state of emergency has been declared.

173
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:50,116
How dare a woman roams around by herself?

174
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:57,827
I am the deposed queen, Jo.

175
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:00,426
As I am ashamed to show my face now,

176
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:03,666
I just wanted to get some fresh
air when no one is around.

177
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,237
It is not safe to go out these
days. Please go back in quickly.

178
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:08,936
I understand. Thank you.

179
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:22,386
The greedy Kim clan tried to kill the King...

180
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:24,386
to frame the innocent.

181
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:27,186
Fate decided to save the King's life.

182
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:30,956
Where is it acceptable to fill
the throne that is not empty?

183
00:24:30,956 --> 00:24:33,226
THE KING IS NOT DEAD.

184
00:24:43,037 --> 00:24:45,277
My lord!

185
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:49,247
This was on the streets, my lord.

186
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,077
What is the matter that you
are making a fuss about?

187
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:58,716
My goodness.

188
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:04,527
THE KING IS NOT DEAD.

189
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:09,797
If so, Her Highness...

190
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:13,166
did not go away to recover.

191
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:18,876
As expected,

192
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:22,446
Lord Kim Jwa Geun sees through Kim Byeong In.

193
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:25,017
I cannot believe he even
expected his betrayal.

194
00:25:26,347 --> 00:25:30,047
His lordship wants us to remain
silent about Kim Byeong In's death.

195
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:32,686
- Yes, Father.
- Anyway,

196
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,456
you also made connections with
Lord Kim Jwa Geun this time.

197
00:25:38,726 --> 00:25:40,497
We missed the Queen.

198
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:43,797
We should make another contribution...

199
00:25:44,936 --> 00:25:46,537
to make up for it. Do you not think so?

200
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:59,476
My gosh. If you boil it that
long, it will become too squishy.

201
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:00,976
Leave him alone.

202
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,886
After the Queen left to recover,

203
00:26:03,886 --> 00:26:05,416
he has not been in his right mind.

204
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:08,116
They say affection grew from hate
is deeper than the one from love.

205
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:12,097
I guess he grew attached to
her so much while she was here.

206
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:26,277
I cannot believe the King
has gone in vain like this.

207
00:26:28,077 --> 00:26:31,307
He sincerely cared about his people.

208
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:40,886
As expected, you were here alone.

209
00:26:44,557 --> 00:26:49,567
Well, I have no one to welcome me at home.

210
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:55,267
Her Highness is greatly
troubled as well, is she not?

211
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:59,136
I do not know what to say to
you either, Court Lady Choi.

212
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:01,007
To me, your existence already...

213
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:04,777
greatly consoled and comforted me.

214
00:27:05,777 --> 00:27:08,987
So I even forgot about
the nagging for a moment.

215
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,456
I feel the same. Thanks to you...

216
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,497
Would you like some?

217
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:19,797
No, I am fine.

218
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:22,097
I am a little busy.

219
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:26,297
Just a moment. I should
give you something at least.

220
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:32,807
I like you.

221
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:38,946
I love you.

222
00:27:39,946 --> 00:27:41,547
I am in no place to express...

223
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,287
those feelings, so...

224
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:47,656
so you...

225
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:51,257
should meet a good partner...

226
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:54,126
to share your loneliness.

227
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,567
Court Lady Choi.

228
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:12,976
I knew something was weird.

229
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:15,646
How is the cooking going?

230
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:18,186
Oh, no, no!

231
00:28:18,787 --> 00:28:20,357
Royal Chef!

232
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:22,726
Oh, I ruined it.

233
00:28:22,757 --> 00:28:25,757
It is a rare sight to see
Royal Chef ruining his food.

234
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:27,257
What happened to you?

235
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:29,696
Nothing happened to me. It
happened to the country.

236
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:31,936
The lower part of the country is in panic.

237
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:34,666
So there have been no gifts
for the past few days.

238
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:36,267
Royal Chef.

239
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:40,107
I heard a strange bill was pasted
on the wall on the streets.

240
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:42,946
The ones who harmed the King...

241
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:46,347
If it is not Donghak followers,
who would do such a thing?

242
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:49,817
They should suffer capital
punishment. We should kill them all!

243
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:54,686
Kill? Do you even know how to do it?

244
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:56,757
Keep your mouth shut.

245
00:28:57,686 --> 00:28:58,827
Tell me about it.

246
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:13,706
I have worn this for too long.
I started to get tired of it.

247
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:16,777
I guess it is time to take it off.

248
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:21,376
You can do it, right? You have
been working for me for 10 years.

249
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:23,446
Pardon?

250
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:28,886
Where are you going?

251
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:31,587
Who is going to prepare the meal?

252
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:34,896
There are many people in
Joseon who can be Royal Chef.

253
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:38,196
What is going on?

254
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:46,636
There has been a strange bill
on the streets for several days.

255
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,047
They say it is about a
rumor related to the King.

256
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,116
My goodness.

257
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:54,547
Is a mere rumor important now?

258
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,916
Everything will be over after
the enthronement ceremony.

259
00:29:58,956 --> 00:30:01,087
What we should worry about now...

260
00:30:01,087 --> 00:30:03,557
is the letter our lives depend on.

261
00:30:03,857 --> 00:30:07,827
It is indeed suspicious that we have
not seen Kim Byeong In these days.

262
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:11,966
The Queen left to prepare for delivery.

263
00:30:12,237 --> 00:30:13,797
And Kim Byeong In is gone too?

264
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:18,577
The King's death and the Queen's travel.

265
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:20,376
Something is suspicious.

266
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:25,747
If both are lies...

267
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:28,247
He hid the Queen who opposed...

268
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:30,347
the idea of faking the death somewhere...

269
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:33,087
and Kim Byeong In took her side?

270
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:35,357
Then Kim Byeong In will write the letter...

271
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:40,726
to bring down the Kim clan.

272
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:47,936
It's cold.

273
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:50,166
Is it cold?

274
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:59,017
This is embarrassing.

275
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:02,916
Oh, hold on.

276
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:15,366
As soon as you left, it
suddenly became so cold.

277
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,696
Did you feel cold because I was not with you?

278
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:28,747
I am grateful for your overflowing affection.

279
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:32,277
2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3,

280
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:33,817
2, 1, 2, 3,

281
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:36,716
- 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Keep going.

282
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,517
That is...

283
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:41,686
It is the training you told me.

284
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:44,327
That is why you wrote a
book on military tactics.

285
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:47,396
I cannot believe His Majesty
is a Donghak believer.

286
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:51,936
I even hid it from them.

287
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:56,037
Like a merchant with discontent
against the country helping them.

288
00:31:57,037 --> 00:31:58,906
Why did you do such a dangerous thing?

289
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:01,337
They say my enemy's enemy is my friend.

290
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:05,347
The corrupted is our common enemy.

291
00:32:07,047 --> 00:32:09,347
But isn't the scale too small?

292
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:10,886
Where is everyone?

293
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:12,587
Do you want us to gather in one
place and get killed at once?

294
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,787
Everyone will gather only
when the time has come.

295
00:32:15,987 --> 00:32:18,557
It is safe to be scattered before then!

296
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:21,396
Are you the boss here?

297
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:22,497
Yes, I am.

298
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:24,597
1, 2, 3, 4,

299
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:26,767
1, 2, 3, 5,

300
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,666
1, 2, 3, 6,

301
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,706
1, 2, 3, 7,

302
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:32,337
- 1, 2, 3, 8.
- Nice to meet you.

303
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:35,007
I can tell you're the boss from your face.

304
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:37,676
The scar around your eye
looks particularly fierce.

305
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:39,416
I'm glad to meet you.

306
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:43,386
The one who lives long is the boss here.

307
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,987
If the boss dies, the next
person becomes the boss.

308
00:32:46,357 --> 00:32:49,557
So being the boss means
surviving the longest.

309
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:53,956
If I die, the one over there is the boss.

310
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:56,366
9, 1, 2, 3, 10.

311
00:32:56,497 --> 00:32:57,827
A boy that young?

312
00:32:58,426 --> 00:33:00,436
I heard my Dam Hyang and you know each other.

313
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:02,466
"My Dam Hyang"?

314
00:33:03,507 --> 00:33:04,866
Are you perhaps...

315
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,907
He is Dam Hyang's father
we have been looking for.

316
00:33:08,976 --> 00:33:11,306
The one who was hit in
the eye with a pitchfork?

317
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:13,617
The world is small!

318
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:17,717
If it were not for my Dam Hyang, I
would have killed this guy already.

319
00:33:17,717 --> 00:33:19,587
If I meet the darn King who made
the country become like this,

320
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:22,357
I will cut his throat as soon as
I see him. That is what I thought.

321
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,857
Thank your daughter.

322
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:28,326
You could die trying to kill me.

323
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,126
What...

324
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:33,637
I should have not saved you.

325
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,467
I should have just cut your
wrist with the straw cutter.

326
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:37,666
3, 10.

327
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:40,177
Until when do we repeat this only?

328
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:42,907
You should have moved on by yourself!

329
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:45,206
Do I have to tell you every time?

330
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:51,217
Dam Hyang had saved you.
And she saved me as well.

331
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,757
The King did not give up on his people.

332
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,257
That is why his people saved the King.

333
00:33:57,587 --> 00:34:00,357
By the way, what happened to
the soldiers chasing after me?

334
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:03,797
Most of the men here were
born and raised here.

335
00:34:03,797 --> 00:34:05,666
They are hunters and herb diggers.

336
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:07,467
They know these mountains inside out.

337
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:10,337
The soldiers will not be able
to outwit these men here.

338
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:12,706
What about that weird guy
wearing the goblin mask?

339
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:13,936
Did you catch him?

340
00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:15,107
- The goblin mask?
- 1, 2,

341
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:17,777
3. 1, 2...

342
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:19,177
Did he chase you too?

343
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:20,677
He tried to kill me.

344
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,846
Kim Byeong In died...

345
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,286
when he tried to stop that guy.

346
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:29,987
The man with the mask...

347
00:34:30,956 --> 00:34:32,596
works for Kim Jwa Geun.

348
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:36,996
Kim Jwa Geun has returned.

349
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,396
1, 2, 3. 7 sets.

350
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:42,067
1, 2, 3. 8 sets.

351
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:43,907
1, 2, 3. 9 sets.

352
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,777
1, 2, 3. 10 sets.

353
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:48,507
This is like the Death Note.

354
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:50,177
It means it has all the names of...

355
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:51,547
corrupted politicians we can get rid of.

356
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:56,387
We just need to find a way
to go back to the palace.

357
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,186
If we were to gather all of our men...

358
00:34:58,186 --> 00:35:00,317
from all over the empire,
how many would we have?

359
00:35:00,786 --> 00:35:02,987
If we were to gather them
from all over the empire,

360
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:04,887
we might have about 1,000 men.

361
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,456
- Is that it?
- That is not a small number.

362
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:09,797
Risking lives is not easy.

363
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:12,197
Then, why didn't you kill the governors?

364
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,067
You should have gone for
their heads to win the war.

365
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:16,637
Do you think we are some
blood-thirsty hyenas?

366
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,576
Even people of low status like us...

367
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,306
can instill fear in our rulers
if we join hands together.

368
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:24,306
We wanted to show them that.

369
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,817
I see. So it was like a PR move?

370
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,887
That is a good strategy.

371
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:32,456
You did not give them an excuse
to launch a fight against you.

372
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:34,556
We may be dense,

373
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:37,686
but we knew that if we went
head-to-head, we would lose.

374
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:41,396
They just recruited 1,000 soldiers.

375
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:47,067
I risked my life to save our empire!

376
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:49,206
How could you not recognize my goodwill?

377
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:51,637
- Royal Chef?
- Unbelievable.

378
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:53,376
"Royal Chef"?

379
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,947
How can we trust a man
who came from the palace?

380
00:35:57,146 --> 00:35:58,706
Forget it.

381
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:01,617
Fine. I will go back. Untie me.

382
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,786
Okay. I will untie it myself.

383
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:08,556
Why are you all scowling at me?

384
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:12,126
You are way younger than
me. Where are your manners?

385
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:13,826
I will not stay even if you beg me!

386
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:15,766
Move!

387
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:19,496
You came in here as you please,

388
00:36:19,496 --> 00:36:21,197
but it is a different story
when you want to leave.

389
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:25,007
This feels quite familiar to me.

390
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,677
You saw all of our faces.

391
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:28,337
And you even found out our base.

392
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:30,376
Do you think you can walk out alive?

393
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:32,076
What?

394
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:33,817
Gosh.

395
00:36:34,346 --> 00:36:36,346
Darn it. Oh, no.

396
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:37,846
- Hey.
- Royal Chef.

397
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:42,726
I guess it is my time to
go. I am hearing things now.

398
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:44,786
Hey, Man Bok.

399
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:52,567
Your Highness! Why are you...

400
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,706
Your Majesty!

401
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:01,076
Royal Chef!

402
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:03,806
Court Lady Choi!

403
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:14,757
Court Lady Choi.

404
00:37:14,757 --> 00:37:17,157
- Royal Chef.
- Court Lady Choi.

405
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:19,326
What happened?

406
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:22,126
Who did this to you?

407
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:23,766
What is this?

408
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,697
- Royal Chef.
- I knew you would save me.

409
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:35,947
What brings you here, Royal Chef?

410
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:37,547
Your Highness.

411
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:41,217
I heard that people who were
unhappy with the empire came here.

412
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,786
So I asked around to find this base.

413
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:46,117
And people who disappeared
from the palace are here.

414
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:50,757
Royal Chef, were you unhappy
with our empire as well?

415
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:52,927
Seeing how things are going at the palace,

416
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:55,456
even, I who was perfectly happy, am unhappy.

417
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:57,396
How are things going at the palace?

418
00:37:57,396 --> 00:37:59,266
Oh, that. Your Highness.

419
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,166
Change your clothes first.

420
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,936
And cover up when you have to sneeze.

421
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,817
The enthronement ceremony
will happen tomorrow.

422
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:22,887
So every second counts.

423
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:24,686
Thank you for your hard work.

424
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,896
By the way, why are Donghak believers...

425
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:29,626
fighting back harder when
we put them in their place?

426
00:38:30,427 --> 00:38:33,337
What I have been hearing does not sound good.

427
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:36,137
The thing about fighting is, the
more your opponent steps away,

428
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:39,306
the more you believe your actions
are justified and become angrier.

429
00:38:39,306 --> 00:38:43,746
Therefore, the only solution is
to giving them a harsher lesson.

430
00:38:44,177 --> 00:38:45,306
As soon as the ceremony ends,

431
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:47,317
I will utilize cannons to
get them under control.

432
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:51,487
You are carrying a sword. I
have not seen that in a while.

433
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:54,157
Is the palace not safe anymore?

434
00:38:54,286 --> 00:38:56,686
This was a gift from the Queen.

435
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:59,896
- The Queen?
- Actually,

436
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:03,967
I am afraid that I have
some bad news this morning.

437
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:06,467
Byeong In sacrificed his life...

438
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:08,237
to save the Queen.

439
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,007
So that was the end of him.

440
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:16,177
The only drawback of being in
youth is the foolishness...

441
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:18,407
of sacrificing everything
to one's fleeting feelings.

442
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:23,786
So is the Queen alive?

443
00:39:25,016 --> 00:39:26,056
Yes.

444
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,387
The King was the one who saved the Queen.

445
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:34,626
So the King and the Queen are both alive?

446
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:37,927
It makes me wonder...

447
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:40,297
if no one is competent anymore
or they are just that clever.

448
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:43,507
I am sorry. That is why...

449
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:51,476
A while ago, when we tried to serve...

450
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,677
the ice with arsenic to the Queen,

451
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:57,317
the King knew about it and ran to us.

452
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:07,357
I believe...

453
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:14,096
there was a rat who has been
listening to us all long.

454
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:25,677
You were the one who gave her as a present.

455
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:28,346
You personally made her go blind and deaf.

456
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:29,947
I was overly sensitive...

457
00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:31,587
as we are about to have
an important ceremony.

458
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,587
I understand.

459
00:40:38,857 --> 00:40:40,956
Let us hold the enthronement
ceremony as soon as we can.

460
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:47,337
Do not forget that those two
had defeated you once before.

461
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:49,936
I will stake my life...

462
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:52,777
on this fight.

463
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:01,076
I have a great idea.

464
00:41:01,617 --> 00:41:04,487
This will allow us to pass the
gate to Hanyang and the palace.

465
00:41:06,456 --> 00:41:08,786
What is this amazing idea?

466
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:11,786
These people are used to eating
food made with fresh ingredients.

467
00:41:11,786 --> 00:41:14,056
How long can they wait
without such fresh food?

468
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:17,297
The Grand Queen Dowager
is a very picky eater.

469
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:19,197
She won't be able to stand it.

470
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:28,607
Not that.

471
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:31,206
That one.

472
00:41:32,076 --> 00:41:33,117
That one.

473
00:41:37,516 --> 00:41:38,617
That's why...

474
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:42,826
this door will never be closed
even if all the doors are closed.

475
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:46,027
It's the door used to deliver ingredients.

476
00:41:52,197 --> 00:41:55,396
We need some information on
the wagon for royal offerings.

477
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:58,706
At the palace, there is a
system for the royal offerings.

478
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:03,376
Every day, the royal kitchen
receives over 50 wagons.

479
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:06,416
On top of that, there are special
offerings for every month.

480
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:09,286
And some offerings that
come in every four months.

481
00:42:10,717 --> 00:42:13,487
- Keep it simple. Get to the point.
- Okay. The point.

482
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,987
62 wagons will enter the palace...

483
00:42:15,987 --> 00:42:18,056
on the morning of the enthronement ceremony.

484
00:42:18,056 --> 00:42:20,326
However, the state of
emergency has been declared.

485
00:42:20,697 --> 00:42:24,567
I am sure they will inspect the
royal offerings more thoroughly.

486
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:28,337
But what if there is a
wagon no one knows about?

487
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:31,637
The secret wagon of Head Inspector.

488
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:36,277
Gosh, you are here.

489
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:39,777
This wagon belongs to us. Let them in.

490
00:42:40,576 --> 00:42:41,746
- All right. Come on in.
- Okay.

491
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:42,987
According to the Royal Chef,

492
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:44,686
Head Inspector tends to swap them.

493
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:46,257
"Swap"?

494
00:42:46,257 --> 00:42:48,516
Well, those high-ranking officials
don't have a refined palate like me.

495
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:50,456
He swaps some of the royal offerings...

496
00:42:50,456 --> 00:42:52,427
with ingredients that are
slightly less inferior.

497
00:42:52,427 --> 00:42:54,427
And Head Inspector's secret wagon carries...

498
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:56,927
the ingredients he uses to
swap with royal offerings.

499
00:42:57,297 --> 00:42:59,967
And only a handful of people know that.

500
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,867
Gosh, I knew it.

501
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:04,467
It should not be called the
palace, but the den of thieves.

502
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:06,837
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

503
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:08,436
I just considered it a custom.

504
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:13,146
Rotten trees are bound to have holes.

505
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:16,846
And we can use those holes to our advantage.

506
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:20,117
Everyone, gather your hands.

507
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:21,786
- Gather your hands.
- Everyone?

508
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:22,987
Get your hands here. Do it.

509
00:43:22,987 --> 00:43:24,657
- Get them here.
- Gosh.

510
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:25,726
1, 2, 3.

511
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:26,927
Let's go!

512
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:28,357
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

513
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:29,927
Let's go.

514
00:43:41,737 --> 00:43:44,447
- Are you ready?
- Yes. Let's go.

515
00:43:48,346 --> 00:43:50,416
- Man Bok.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

516
00:43:50,817 --> 00:43:51,887
Hurry.

517
00:43:55,317 --> 00:43:57,027
- He even changed?
- Let us go.

518
00:44:46,107 --> 00:44:47,277
Thank you.

519
00:44:49,907 --> 00:44:51,277
And I'm sorry.

520
00:44:54,476 --> 00:44:57,217
You were special to Kim So Yong too.

521
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:14,536
I want to bury him myself.

522
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,306
Okay.

523
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:36,956
Rest in peace.

524
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:43,927
Shall we get going?

525
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:04,887
You may speak.

526
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:10,186
The Queen should be preparing
for the birth of her child...

527
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:12,626
with her mother,

528
00:46:13,797 --> 00:46:18,396
but since that is not possible,
I would like to help her myself.

529
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:22,806
I came here to ask where she is recuperating.

530
00:46:22,806 --> 00:46:24,967
The Queen is pregnant with
the heir to the throne,

531
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:27,337
so I cannot reveal the location
for the sake of her safety.

532
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:28,936
I have made sure that she
has everything she needs,

533
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:30,547
so do not worry.

534
00:46:35,947 --> 00:46:37,117
Here.

535
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,936
THE KING IS NOT DEAD.

536
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:58,567
Did she really go someplace to recuperate?

537
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:02,376
You did not hurt her, did you?

538
00:47:03,876 --> 00:47:06,117
The Queen has run away.

539
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:09,376
We are protecting her honor.

540
00:47:11,617 --> 00:47:13,317
- She ran away?
- She falsely believes that...

541
00:47:13,317 --> 00:47:16,016
the King is alive, so she left the Palace.

542
00:47:17,887 --> 00:47:19,257
I apologize,

543
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:23,266
but I will speak without reserve
to the Grand Queen Dowager.

544
00:47:24,197 --> 00:47:28,467
Your behavior does not help our family.

545
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:31,436
Rather, you are dirtying
the name of our family.

546
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:33,206
Do you not realize...

547
00:47:33,206 --> 00:47:35,476
what future generations
will say about our family?

548
00:47:35,976 --> 00:47:39,576
Are you in any position to say that to me?

549
00:47:41,547 --> 00:47:44,916
At the very least, I know how to be ashamed.

550
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:47,757
Your shame is what makes it a crime.

551
00:47:47,757 --> 00:47:49,987
If you do not feel
ashamed, it is not a crime.

552
00:47:49,987 --> 00:47:51,786
If it is not for the sake
of our family's honor,

553
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:55,496
what is it that you wish to
obtain by going so far...

554
00:47:55,496 --> 00:47:56,896
as to hurt the King?

555
00:47:59,797 --> 00:48:01,867
My time must not end...

556
00:48:02,536 --> 00:48:05,837
until the moment I let
go of everything myself.

557
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:47,076
You can hear.

558
00:48:58,027 --> 00:49:01,056
- Over here.
- Oh, Dae Ho.

559
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:04,126
Your Majesty.

560
00:49:04,726 --> 00:49:05,967
I see you came before us.

561
00:49:06,197 --> 00:49:07,496
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:49:07,496 --> 00:49:09,396
Gosh, my knees hurt so badly.

563
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:10,637
Your Highness.

564
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:12,976
Hi.

565
00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:18,146
I am glad to see you alive.
You have been through so much.

566
00:49:18,447 --> 00:49:20,277
We are glad that you are safe, Your Majesty.

567
00:49:21,677 --> 00:49:23,246
Does anyone have cigarettes?

568
00:49:23,286 --> 00:49:25,387
Your Highness, the ground is cold.

569
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:34,556
I would love nothing more than an
ice-cold can of beer right now.

570
00:49:37,396 --> 00:49:39,197
This place isn't that great,

571
00:49:39,197 --> 00:49:40,536
so why did we come all the way here?

572
00:49:40,536 --> 00:49:43,936
This is a safe place that has
not been revealed to anyone.

573
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,706
Is that so? It would be hard to
reveal even if you wanted to.

574
00:49:48,337 --> 00:49:49,706
Gosh, my legs.

575
00:49:57,686 --> 00:49:58,786
Darn it.

576
00:50:00,556 --> 00:50:01,657
Not yet.

577
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:03,087
It's been long enough.

578
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:05,887
This is our last chance. We must be careful.

579
00:50:14,697 --> 00:50:15,967
It is time.

580
00:50:27,876 --> 00:50:29,117
Is it that delicious?

581
00:50:40,126 --> 00:50:42,297
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

582
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,317
Oh, my goodness.

583
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:25,421
It tastes so good.

584
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:43,541
Why are you asking for trouble?

585
00:51:44,742 --> 00:51:47,682
People like me are bound to die anyway,

586
00:51:47,682 --> 00:51:49,182
so we have no choice.

587
00:51:49,342 --> 00:51:52,311
You guys are in the highest
positions in all of Joseon.

588
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:55,882
If you just turned a blind eye,
will you not live in comfort?

589
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:58,892
There was a time in my life...

590
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:01,961
where living was just a
nightmare I had to endure.

591
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:05,532
I endured everything with
the thought of revenge...

592
00:52:06,802 --> 00:52:09,831
against those who killed
my parents and siblings.

593
00:52:10,901 --> 00:52:14,101
Then I began to see Joseon rotting,

594
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:17,441
and I saw the people who
were suffering within it.

595
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:22,342
You are a King with very keen eyes.

596
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:24,952
I thought everyone who lived
in the Palace was blind.

597
00:52:27,421 --> 00:52:29,151
If we succeed this time,

598
00:52:29,992 --> 00:52:33,291
you will not end up like them, will you?

599
00:52:37,132 --> 00:52:38,432
I am...

600
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:42,632
dreaming of a new Joseon.

601
00:52:45,671 --> 00:52:48,072
You called it "voting", right?

602
00:52:49,072 --> 00:52:50,072
What?

603
00:52:50,072 --> 00:52:52,472
When the people choose their own king.

604
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,081
Yes. Voting.

605
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:56,952
That doesn't mean the world
becomes perfect though.

606
00:53:04,452 --> 00:53:07,222
Well, it is already perfect.

607
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:10,231
You can always change when it goes wrong.

608
00:53:11,532 --> 00:53:14,932
Both the King and the Queen are crazy.

609
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:18,932
Okay, go to bed early since
the big event is waiting.

610
00:53:22,871 --> 00:53:23,972
Good night.

611
00:53:28,882 --> 00:53:31,112
If you really came from the future,

612
00:53:31,851 --> 00:53:34,021
you must know the result
of this fight as well.

613
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:37,191
What happens?

614
00:53:42,392 --> 00:53:43,592
You will lose.

615
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:49,731
But I will bet everything on you.

616
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,401
Do you not always take sides with the winner?

617
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:56,302
It's okay.

618
00:53:56,302 --> 00:53:58,171
I'm already screwed in this life.

619
00:53:58,811 --> 00:54:00,941
Even if I bet everything,
there's nothing much.

620
00:54:02,882 --> 00:54:05,412
You put all your eggs in my basket.

621
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:09,182
Yes. All in. I went all-in in you.

622
00:54:12,992 --> 00:54:15,961
Then even if I fail, I will do my best.

623
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:19,731
Until this guy called fate gets tired of me.

624
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:22,731
I will not let him eat me up easily.

625
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:44,691
I cannot believe...

626
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:47,521
I am no help to His Majesty
as I am stuck in here.

627
00:54:48,322 --> 00:54:50,191
Do you think Her Highness met His Majesty?

628
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:54,101
Even if they met, what
can they do by themselves?

629
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:57,901
I'm not sure if there is a way...

630
00:54:57,901 --> 00:54:59,901
to stop the enthronement in here.

631
00:55:04,842 --> 00:55:06,211
What if we use Kim Hwan...

632
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:12,251
Special Director Hong.

633
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:19,992
You came again?

634
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:21,921
I brought something.

635
00:55:25,061 --> 00:55:26,191
What is it?

636
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:31,671
I am collecting appeals...

637
00:55:31,671 --> 00:55:33,231
to take you two out as well.

638
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:38,041
But is there any way I can
help you more properly?

639
00:55:40,142 --> 00:55:41,311
The way to help us?

640
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,651
Yes. Tell me anything.

641
00:55:44,412 --> 00:55:46,251
- Anything?
- Yes.

642
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:49,921
There is nothing I cannot
do if it is for you.

643
00:55:55,592 --> 00:55:56,731
Why do you...

644
00:55:58,392 --> 00:56:00,561
believe people so easily?

645
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:04,702
Is it your job to feed swindlers?

646
00:56:04,871 --> 00:56:07,041
How are you going to
survive in this cruel world?

647
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:10,041
Sorry, I was wrong.

648
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:14,242
- What did you do wrong?
- I do not know what it is,

649
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:17,552
but if you tell me, I will never do it again.

650
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:18,912
What you did wrong...

651
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:22,581
is to trust a person like me.

652
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:29,162
I tried to get close to
you to dig up information.

653
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:31,432
But you had no idea.

654
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:36,662
What is all this?

655
00:56:42,501 --> 00:56:43,541
So...

656
00:56:46,311 --> 00:56:48,882
you did not think of me
as a friend all this time?

657
00:56:49,342 --> 00:56:50,382
No.

658
00:56:51,412 --> 00:56:52,811
I did not think of you...

659
00:56:54,182 --> 00:56:55,682
as my friend. Not even for a second.

660
00:56:58,822 --> 00:57:00,421
So do not ever come back.

661
00:57:36,592 --> 00:57:38,592
Why are you looking at me like that?

662
00:57:39,092 --> 00:57:41,162
Are you blaming me...

663
00:57:41,532 --> 00:57:43,362
for making it impossible
to use him any longer?

664
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:46,601
I was not looking at you.

665
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:51,171
Such disgrace just happened
in front of my eyes.

666
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:02,882
You must have been very tired.

667
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,961
I didn't water it down.

668
00:58:12,862 --> 00:58:14,202
I mixed it with soju.

669
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:17,932
Golden ratio, somaek.

670
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:26,472
It seems like you are having a good dream.

671
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:30,751
I am relieved.

672
00:58:53,432 --> 00:58:55,171
What on earth were you dreaming about?

673
00:58:55,371 --> 00:58:57,912
The royal portrait was burning.

674
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:02,711
The fire swallowed the
entire Seonwonjeon Hall.

675
00:59:03,242 --> 00:59:07,182
And I was stuck here alone when the fire...

676
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:25,972
Today is an important day.

677
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:27,541
I cannot waste a drop.

678
00:59:55,632 --> 00:59:57,831
Powder my face without any flaw.

679
01:00:07,412 --> 01:00:11,612
THE ENTHRONEMENT CEREMONY DAY

680
01:00:23,831 --> 01:00:25,362
For His Majesty's safety,

681
01:00:25,362 --> 01:00:28,302
I issued a curfew order in
the palace as well today.

682
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:29,831
Except for soldiers,

683
01:00:29,831 --> 01:00:32,101
everyone must stay indoors in the palace.

684
01:00:33,202 --> 01:00:34,242
Yes.

685
01:00:34,242 --> 01:00:37,012
I did not call the royal family
as well as instrument players.

686
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,771
Please let the ceremony take place quietly.

687
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:41,182
Even the royal family?

688
01:00:41,182 --> 01:00:42,882
It is safe that way.

689
01:00:42,882 --> 01:00:43,912
But...

690
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:55,362
What I say is right.

691
01:00:58,662 --> 01:00:59,892
I understand.

692
01:01:08,072 --> 01:01:10,572
Your Highness, are you not scared?

693
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:12,211
Don't worry.

694
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,782
Religious people I met
sometimes on the streets...

695
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:17,012
told me my ancestors are blessing me a lot.

696
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:19,112
I'm going to use the bliss this time.

697
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:21,581
Your Highness.

698
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:26,392
More than any other day, you
look like the Queen I know.

699
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:32,132
Let's not create the mood.

700
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:34,802
It seems like today is the last
day. It's just the beginning.

701
01:01:35,532 --> 01:01:37,032
You are right, Your Highness.

702
01:01:47,012 --> 01:01:48,811
Please meet us in the palace tonight.

703
01:01:49,842 --> 01:01:52,412
I will. I'll get going.

704
01:01:56,322 --> 01:01:57,521
Do not die.

705
01:01:57,521 --> 01:01:59,492
What is so good about living?

706
01:01:59,492 --> 01:02:03,162
Even if our lives are unfortunate
and pathetic, let us live longer.

707
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:06,961
If we succeed this time,

708
01:02:06,961 --> 01:02:10,501
I will "vote" you as the King or whatever.

709
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:13,901
Thank you.

710
01:02:18,112 --> 01:02:19,242
Shall we go?

711
01:02:19,972 --> 01:02:21,581
It's time to go home.

712
01:02:23,481 --> 01:02:24,981
Criminal Lee Gyeong Eung...

713
01:02:24,981 --> 01:02:27,552
hid the identity of Donghak
believers who committed treason.

714
01:02:27,822 --> 01:02:28,921
He will be deprived of the office...

715
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:30,621
and go into exile.

716
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:32,892
Criminal Hong Doo Il...

717
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:34,722
lost the firearms.

718
01:02:34,722 --> 01:02:36,222
He will work at the Personnel
Clerk's Office of the Ganghwa...

719
01:02:36,222 --> 01:02:38,632
Local Government as a
government slave for 600 days.

720
01:02:41,302 --> 01:02:42,862
After the enthronement ceremony,

721
01:02:42,862 --> 01:02:44,601
I will immediately carry out your execution.

722
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:55,182
There was no accomplishment
to write for the acting King.

723
01:02:55,182 --> 01:02:57,282
It gave us a hard time.

724
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:03,021
The royal funeral is not over yet.

725
01:03:03,021 --> 01:03:05,452
Is it appropriate to
smile showing your teeth?

726
01:03:07,691 --> 01:03:08,992
My apologies.

727
01:03:11,231 --> 01:03:14,101
Whether the enthronement
ceremony will take place...

728
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:16,162
without any trouble or not depends on you.

729
01:03:16,632 --> 01:03:19,632
Yes, my lord. I will make
sure to perform my duty so...

730
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:22,072
the absence of Minister of War
does not affect the result.

731
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:24,711
By the way,

732
01:03:25,371 --> 01:03:30,041
when is Minister of War coming to the palace?

733
01:03:31,581 --> 01:03:34,322
I guess you want to know the
whereabouts of the letter.

734
01:03:35,351 --> 01:03:37,322
Everyone is caring about it.

735
01:03:37,322 --> 01:03:40,021
Do not worry. I am taking care of it.

736
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,662
Of course.

737
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:46,592
The King and the Pungyang Jo clan...

738
01:03:48,202 --> 01:03:50,132
will become my puppets from now on.

739
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:09,481
Mister, I'll pay you double to the palace.

740
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:12,351
Double.

741
01:04:26,932 --> 01:04:29,601
Hey, we're good people.

742
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:34,012
If the Head Inspector or anybody
notice something suspicious,

743
01:04:35,242 --> 01:04:37,751
we can become bad people for real.

744
01:04:39,081 --> 01:04:41,222
Whether human nature is
good or bad, I don't care.

745
01:04:41,222 --> 01:04:43,621
It all depends on what the others do.

746
01:04:45,392 --> 01:04:47,392
Just act naturally.

747
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:48,592
Let's go.

748
01:05:04,972 --> 01:05:06,171
Let us go.

749
01:05:19,722 --> 01:05:22,492
It's uncomfortable. Move a little.

750
01:05:24,662 --> 01:05:25,731
Like this?

751
01:05:26,061 --> 01:05:27,461
Is this your elbow?

752
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:29,032
Stop poking me.

753
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:32,001
If you press my stomach like that...

754
01:05:32,702 --> 01:05:34,371
My gosh.

755
01:05:39,711 --> 01:05:40,742
Move.

756
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:45,012
Come on.

757
01:05:47,052 --> 01:05:48,481
I can finally see something.

758
01:05:56,521 --> 01:05:57,762
In here...

759
01:06:02,401 --> 01:06:03,501
We don't have time for this.

760
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:06,302
Yes, we should get it together.

761
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:09,441
I'm glad I didn't hide with the guard here.

762
01:06:10,242 --> 01:06:11,612
Why do you have to say that?

763
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:15,811
Move a little. Let me change my position.

764
01:06:20,451 --> 01:06:21,581
My gosh.

765
01:06:29,722 --> 01:06:32,661
It's comfortable now.

766
01:06:34,262 --> 01:06:36,961
I also think this position is the best.

767
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:49,142
We'll get caught because of the
sound of your heart beating.

768
01:06:49,442 --> 01:06:50,951
Why are you so scared?

769
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:54,012
It is not just the sound from my heart.

770
01:07:04,432 --> 01:07:07,031
It is also not because I am scared.

771
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:10,871
It is because of you, My Queen.

772
01:07:16,071 --> 01:07:19,512
It is not because I am scared either.

773
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:47,371
It is from England.

774
01:07:47,371 --> 01:07:49,102
It is much stronger and faster.

775
01:07:53,442 --> 01:07:56,342
If the King shows himself in the palace,

776
01:07:57,411 --> 01:07:59,512
aim at his heart.

777
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,842
Are you new workers?

778
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:25,541
Yes, we are.

779
01:08:27,142 --> 01:08:28,512
Come on in.

780
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:49,531
Stop.

781
01:09:00,611 --> 01:09:01,882
- Search it.
- Yes, sir!

782
01:09:18,692 --> 01:09:20,132
There is nothing suspicious.

783
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:55,302
MR. QUEEN

784
01:10:15,321 --> 01:10:19,192
<i>As soon as the enthronement
ceremony ends, I will kill them all.</i>

785
01:10:19,192 --> 01:10:22,262
<i>It's the same feeling I have before
the final boss shows up in games.</i>

786
01:10:22,262 --> 01:10:23,892
<i>I'm amazing with knives.</i>

787
01:10:24,732 --> 01:10:27,432
<i>I was crazy. Hearing it
was a special mission,</i>

788
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:28,802
<i>my heart boiled.</i>

789
01:10:28,802 --> 01:10:31,902
<i>The change you were afraid of
so much has already started.</i>

790
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:34,171
<i>What in the world are you doing?</i>

791
01:10:34,201 --> 01:10:36,041
<i>The king and Donghak
believers on the same side?</i>

792
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:38,812
<i>I am the family of those you killed.</i>

793
01:10:38,812 --> 01:10:43,512
<i>I am the king of the people you trampled on!</i>
