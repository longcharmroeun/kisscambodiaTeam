00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,370
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,540
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,309
Congratulations, Your Highness.

4
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,820
My Queen, thank you.

5
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,829
- Congratulations, Your Highness!
- Congratulations, Your Highness!

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,699
I am becoming a father!

7
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,540
I'm...

8
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,509
pregnant?

9
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,899
Everyone, stop!

10
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,350
- Goodness.
- Get out.

11
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,080
- Your Highness.
- Goodness.

12
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,729
Why is the Queen so upset?

13
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,669
She is not upset.

14
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,210
She is just expressing her happiness.

15
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,009
Yes.

16
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,109
Is this what you call pregnancy syndrome?

17
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,089
This is more than just an identity crisis.

18
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:07,989
My identity will cease to exist,
and my soul will be destroyed.

19
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,229
Is this how my life ends?

20
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:18,500
I told you that I was
against getting married.

21
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,470
Even if I had accidentally gotten married,

22
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,070
I was never planning to have children.

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,109
It's hard for me to survive by
myself in this warlike life,

24
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,310
so how could I become pregnant?

25
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,440
It's as reckless as taking
off your bulletproof vest...

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,679
as you dance the samba while
bullets are heading towards you.

27
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,979
That's not all.

28
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,949
Pregnancy and childbirth are so hard
that they can reduce one's lifespan.

29
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,549
You're literally giving up your
life to give it to your child.

30
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:40,690
Why do I have to give
up my life expectancy...

31
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,620
to a child I don't even know?

32
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,100
Darned Mother Nature. Give someone else...

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,859
the provision of nature!

34
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,209
I can't believe I'm pregnant!

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,720
EPISODE 17, PREGNANCY IS BEAUTIFUL

36
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,989
You must wait. Your Highness.

37
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,660
EPISODE 17

38
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,329
You fabricated the dead body.

39
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:24,400
Did you think I would
fail to recognize O Wol?

40
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:29,139
I did it so that you can open your eyes...

41
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,070
to your true self that you were unaware of.

42
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,209
The Queen has turned her
back on the Andong Kim clan.

43
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,179
In return, the Andong Kim
clan has joined hands with us.

44
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,720
It is your best chance to become the Queen.

45
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,660
Do not try to control me ever again.

46
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,900
How long can a bird that has
been tamed by a human live...

47
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,900
if it chose to leave the birdcage?

48
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,440
There is an announcement that
the King wants the world to know.

49
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,609
What is it?

50
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,620
The Queen...

51
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,290
is pregnant.

52
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:43,580
That is the sound of the drum
to announce a joyful occasion.

53
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,319
Now that my storeroom is empty,

54
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,489
there is no way for me
to fill my empty heart.

55
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,119
No delicacy can fill my stomach...

56
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,059
No, my heart. What can I fill it with?

57
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:36,200
I have even turned my back on my family.

58
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,770
I am a loner.

59
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,140
My lord!

60
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:45,809
My lord!

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,510
- My lord!
- What is it?

62
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,379
An urgent message has
arrived from the Palace.

63
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,290
Did something happen to the Queen again?

64
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:01,859
The Queen is pregnant!

65
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,799
What is the reason?

66
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,499
Your Majesty. Rather than
searching for the reason,

67
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:20,879
perhaps you should find a
way to make her feel better?

68
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,010
That is a good idea. How can I do that?

69
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,210
How can I make a woman feel happy?

70
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,619
I should not have asked you.

71
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,890
Who should I ask regarding this?

72
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,229
That is why...

73
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:47,340
I have invited an expert to help you
resolve your worries, Jong Cheol.

74
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,290
All he has done these days
was eat and think about that.

75
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,270
What are you doing?

76
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,340
She will probably get mad at you like this.

77
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,970
That is when you tell her this.

78
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,710
"I watered my flower."

79
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,350
I do not think I could live if I do that.

80
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,119
I guess she has a temper.

81
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,290
If that is the case,

82
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,520
there is a sure method.

83
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,989
What is that?

84
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,900
You make a silly face like this.

85
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:55,470
I hate myself for thinking
the same thing as him.

86
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,470
I apologize.

87
00:07:58,109 --> 00:07:59,910
It has definitely been helpful.

88
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,210
No way.

89
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,910
I realized how foolish it is to look
for an answer from someone else.

90
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,979
When I am the only person
who knows about her well.

91
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,040
Why are you crying? I'm
the one who wants to cry.

92
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,770
It is because I am so happy.

93
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:34,579
You can cry as much as you want today.

94
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,349
Fine. You can cry.

95
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,250
You can cry in my stead.

96
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,219
For the sake of my life,

97
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,459
which I had no choice in.

98
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,130
Your Highness.

99
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:03,040
You should stop shedding tears of happiness.

100
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,010
Then what should I be doing?

101
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,140
You must personally announce your
pregnancy to the Internal Court...

102
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,079
and receive congratulations.

103
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,150
I don't want to. I cut ties with my in-laws.

104
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,349
Whether you cut ties with
them or you sewed it back up,

105
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,559
if you do not follow procedure,
you will be called to account.

106
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,689
I hate my pregnancy even more.

107
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,059
The Grand Queen Dowager is here.

108
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:32,400
The Queen Dowager is also here.

109
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,870
They have beaten you to it.

110
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,900
What should we do about this?

111
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,290
Welcome.

112
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,799
I should have gone to you
to announce the news myself,

113
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,469
but as you can see, I cannot get up.

114
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,040
What are my symptoms?

115
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:18,079
She has severe dizziness
due to morning sickness...

116
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,150
and pregnancy pains.

117
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,150
Yes, that is it.

118
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,849
That is why I came personally.

119
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:30,419
Please...

120
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,329
have a seat.

121
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:34,630
It is okay.

122
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,870
Your body must feel heavy.
Please sit comfortably.

123
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,730
Okay, then.

124
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:51,510
Upon hearing the news, I was so elated.

125
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,280
I even got you a talisman even
though I stopped getting them.

126
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,079
I just wanted to make sure...

127
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,189
that you bring a healthy
child into this world.

128
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,459
It kind of looks like a curse.

129
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:10,000
I am an atheist. I do
not believe in talismans.

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,230
You will realize it when you
give birth to your child.

131
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,900
You will want to believe
something that you never did.

132
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:18,770
You will become desperate...

133
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,179
and want to make a wish on
the stone people kick around.

134
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:28,520
You may not fear anything in this world.

135
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,919
But now, you will fear
everything in this world.

136
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,620
Losing a child reflects poorly on the mother.

137
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:40,630
I talked to the royal physician
and asked him to make medicine...

138
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,360
that will prevent you from a miscarriage.

139
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,530
Make sure to take the
medicine every single day.

140
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,099
If something happens to the child,

141
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,339
you will be held responsible.

142
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,870
From now on, do not behave rashly.

143
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,809
You must be careful for
the sake of your child.

144
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,049
Both of them came to threaten me.

145
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,719
I really feel like throwing up.

146
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,140
Thank you for your wisdom.

147
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,319
This is Prince Yeongpyeong.

148
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,099
Please come in.

149
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,910
You came because you were worried.

150
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,079
I am okay,

151
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,610
but I will not be able to bring myself...

152
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,880
to congratulate His Majesty and the Queen.

153
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,890
I should focus on my path.

154
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,929
I came to the palace to
be of help to His Majesty.

155
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,290
I thought the only way...

156
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,829
I could help him was by
giving him emotional comfort.

157
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,569
But when I saw the Queen, I
realized that I was wrong.

158
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,540
It is your best chance to become the Queen.

159
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:47,959
Queen Dowager.

160
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,329
To what do I owe the pleasure?

161
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,599
What brings you here,
Royal Noble Consort Eui?

162
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,339
You have joined hands
with the Andong Kim clan.

163
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:15,079
- It is the clan's wish.
- Do not sell our clan's name...

164
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:16,679
for your petty fight.

165
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,250
Do you wish to keep your position
as Right State Councilor?

166
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,130
I hope you will make the right decision.

167
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,459
If not, I will gather the
members of our clan...

168
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,699
who truly care about...

169
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,329
the future of Joseon with my father.

170
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,679
My father sent all of them?

171
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,179
Yes.

172
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,079
These are presents for the
child you are carrying.

173
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:50,020
There is more.

174
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,919
There are more presents in the hall.

175
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,730
That puzzles me even more.

176
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,699
As it is dark, I will light the candles.

177
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:08,439
I don't care about those candles.

178
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,569
Starting now, my life...

179
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:13,740
will be pitch dark.

180
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,939
TO LEFT STATE COUNCILOR KIM SEOK GEUN

181
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:45,040
Once again, they had gone
after the civil servant.

182
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
They did not behead the leader.

183
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,179
They could not go after the leader...

184
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:52,049
because they feared that
it may be seen as treason.

185
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,419
Gosh, the guts of these farmers.

186
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:58,089
We do not have an excuse to
utilize our men on a large scale.

187
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,290
This is giving me a headache.

188
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,490
By the way, was the cipher
of Donghak believers...

189
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,990
found in the palace?

190
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:15,500
KIM SO YONG

191
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,240
Seeing how Donghak believers were
able to penetrate the palace,

192
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,839
this is a major problem. We must hurry.

193
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,110
What if we end up with...

194
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,480
a lot of believes because we
did not do anything about them?

195
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,650
You can just focus on your assignments.

196
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,589
Your Highness, starting today...

197
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:42,599
"TAEGYOSINGI"

198
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,230
you will begin your parental education.

199
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,569
You cannot lie on your side.

200
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,709
You cannot lean on your arm.

201
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,309
You cannot lift your neck while lying down.

202
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,309
Darn it.

203
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,460
You cannot laugh, be startled, get scared,

204
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,700
weep, cry,

205
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,799
or talk excessively.

206
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,510
You must stay away from such unusual tastes.

207
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,180
It's like my body doesn't even belong to me!

208
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,549
Well, that is true.

209
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,020
But I was just getting used to this.

210
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:43,260
How come everything went back to
square one with this pregnancy?

211
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,629
Especially you, Court Lady Choi.

212
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:48,430
I thought you decided to stop nagging me.

213
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:52,899
This is all for your baby.

214
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,869
I must survive first for the baby to survive.

215
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:56,200
Am I a machine that pops out babies?

216
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,440
Am I a living incubator?

217
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,670
Besides, I shouldn't be the
only one going through this.

218
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,909
What about the dad?

219
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,609
Go and tell Cheoljong to
have his prenatal education!

220
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,649
Actually, the 3rd line of the 1st
chapter in "Taegyosingi" states...

221
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:10,079
that the father is responsible
to undergo prenatal education.

222
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,290
Once His Majesty finishes
tending his business today,

223
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,950
you and he will both learn...

224
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,520
My day started with the pregnancy.

225
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,089
And it will end with that?

226
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:22,930
My life is already gone.

227
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,799
No, Your Highness.

228
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,609
- No, Your Highness. Take it.
- Darn it.

229
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,639
Hong Yeon.

230
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,280
After that incident,

231
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,450
the Queen and Kim Byeong In
no longer see each other.

232
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,750
After getting rejected, he must
have heard about her pregnancy.

233
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,589
I bet he has no one to rely on.

234
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:50,420
Poor thing.

235
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,470
I hope you are eating your meals.

236
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,099
I will see you later.

237
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,609
You should sleep at home.

238
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,649
You seem haggard.

239
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,960
Stress is the cause of every illness.

240
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,730
This will be very bad for the baby too.

241
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,000
Keep a lookout.

242
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:35,639
Just one spoonful.

243
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,740
My pear blossom wine.

244
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,349
Royal Chef!

245
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,460
Where's my pear blossom wine?

246
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,760
It was spoiled, so I threw it out.

247
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,409
You seem like you're in a good mood.

248
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,149
I am the same as any other day.

249
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:30,119
You said you stopped smiling a long time ago.

250
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,690
I found my smile back.

251
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,399
I lost my pear blossom wine.
But you found your smile back.

252
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:41,970
What a coincidence.

253
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,079
Be honest with me, Court Lady Choi.

254
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,780
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

255
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:53,879
You're taking revenge for your
struggle as you're given a chance!

256
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:57,680
You do not want to shake me, Your Highness.

257
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:02,220
Throw it up. Spit out my pear blossom wine!

258
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,589
Please calm down, Your Highness!

259
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,530
You should rather talk it out, Your Highness!

260
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:07,129
Talk it out, my foot.

261
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,829
My pear blossom wine.

262
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,040
They drank all of my pear blossom wine.

263
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:19,240
- My pear blossom wine.
- Your Highness!

264
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,980
Give me my pear blossom wine!

265
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:30,049
- Your Highness.
- My pear blossom wine.

266
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,049
Why are you crying, Your Highness?

267
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,270
I have been waiting for you.

268
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,440
You look cool like a prince on a white horse.

269
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,710
I can't do this and that, but you
can ride a horse and have fun.

270
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,909
You are very upset today as always.

271
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,609
I am glad.

272
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:02,819
Let us ride together.

273
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,119
You cannot do that, Your Majesty.

274
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,960
Her Highness is pregnant with a royal baby.

275
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,589
You cannot ride with her, Your Majesty.

276
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,970
Your Highness!

277
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,069
Your Highness! It is dangerous!

278
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,879
- Your Highness!
- You cannot do that!

279
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:29,940
Oh, no!

280
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,359
Where are we?

281
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,299
I always wanted to give you...

282
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,470
something you like and want the most.

283
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,540
The one you cannot find
in the palace but outside.

284
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,240
- A nightlife?
- I meant freedom.

285
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,379
Do you not like it?

286
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:11,750
You should've just said it's
a walk. Why so grandiose?

287
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,220
We came to a royal villa
to get some fresh air.

288
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:17,589
Let us go back if you do not like it.

289
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,530
A royal villa is like a summer house, right?

290
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:26,569
It's nice. It feels like a
rich man is flirting with me.

291
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,170
Now that we're here, I might
look around before we go.

292
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,569
I knew you would like it, My Queen.

293
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,440
This way, please.

294
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,010
It's nice to be a king.

295
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,649
Having a luxurious villa and a garden.

296
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,450
I thought about it all
night. Why you are so mad.

297
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:48,720
Being pregnant is usually a
blessing to women in the palace.

298
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,089
But why does it make the Queen so upset?

299
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,500
So? Do you know why?

300
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:59,500
No. No matter how much I
think about it, I do not know.

301
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,069
I do not understand it,
so I decided to accept it.

302
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:09,609
That a blessing to others
might not be a blessing to you.

303
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,879
That it is just who you are.

304
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,619
I guess Queen Dictionary
was indeed quite useful.

305
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,569
Why are you doing this?
You're making it awkward.

306
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,079
My Queen.

307
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,960
Is it "roar"?

308
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,730
Roar!

309
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:10,639
As I am writing Queen Dictionary,
there is something I want to know.

310
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,609
What does "all in" mean?

311
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:15,780
Have I said something like that?

312
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,409
That is the word you shouted at
the gambling place at the market.

313
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,950
All in...

314
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:26,450
is a very foolish behavior...

315
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:29,119
to put all your fragile eggs in one basket.

316
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,430
- Eggs?
- I did that foolish thing.

317
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,500
I can't believe at a time when I should run,

318
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:39,770
I stumbled over a stone
called pregnancy and fell.

319
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,500
Do not worry, My Queen.

320
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:48,079
I will make sure to cut off
the rotten parts of Joseon.

321
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,180
For our baby...

322
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,549
who will inherit the country.

323
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,089
Fine.

324
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,859
If this child becomes the king
and inherits this country...

325
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:07,389
I can wield absolute power?

326
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,670
SUNWON'S WORLD

327
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,000
SO YONG'S WORLD

328
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:17,639
Why didn't I think of it so far?

329
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,440
- What do you mean?
- My baby!

330
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,639
Look!

331
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:25,950
Everything under the sky...

332
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:28,879
is all yours.

333
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,990
Let's go back.

334
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,349
I will start a proper prenatal education.

335
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,990
"A proper prenatal education"?

336
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,990
I should teach him how to win a fierce fight.

337
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,760
This baby will have to keep
living in this warlike palace.

338
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,659
Let's go. Start the engine.

339
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,730
We just came.

340
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,770
Even if I write 100 volumes
of Queen Dictionary,

341
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:53,569
will I ever see a day when
I can understand the Queen?

342
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:56,780
- Please wait for me.
- Hurry up!

343
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:02,527
JOURNAL FOR PRENATAL EDUCATION

344
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:19,378
My baby.

345
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,487
To survive in a palace,

346
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:25,187
you cannot be lazy about making your people.

347
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,128
Your Majesty!

348
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,027
They are indeed the best warriors in Joseon.

349
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:37,428
My baby.

350
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:40,638
You should have your enemies close to you.

351
00:27:41,197 --> 00:27:42,767
1,000 soldiers, you said.

352
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:45,437
Are you going to build up military power...

353
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,678
and invade Seonjeongjeon Hall or something?

354
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:50,477
Are you scared?

355
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:54,987
I guess it is you who are scared...

356
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:57,088
who prepared 1,000 soldiers for me.

357
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,418
Halve the number of soldiers.

358
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,418
Send the rest to Royal Guard Division.

359
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:05,697
My baby, you must have a treasury
with your money in secrecy.

360
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:09,527
These are the newly minted coins.

361
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:11,898
- How much did you issue?
- A million.

362
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:16,737
This is the King's political funds?

363
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:19,378
You can buy power with money.

364
00:28:20,707 --> 00:28:24,047
Lastly, my baby, this is
the most important part.

365
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:27,818
Get rid of everyone who is not on your side.

366
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:30,418
Life is a real game. The world is a jungle.

367
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:33,687
You'll get eaten if you don't
eat others. A slaughter party!

368
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:36,257
Of course, you will try your
best to establish peace.

369
00:28:36,787 --> 00:28:38,697
But if there's no hope,

370
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:41,628
you must win no matter
what it takes, my baby.

371
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:47,737
I am so glad...

372
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:49,767
that Her Highness pulled herself together.

373
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:52,977
He is still in your belly. Do you
already have so many things to say?

374
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,678
He will listen only when he's in my belly.

375
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:58,277
He won't listen at all after he's born.

376
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:03,118
It is time to go to bed, Your Highness.

377
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:06,858
I have no time to sleep. I
have so many things to do.

378
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:09,428
Life is like a treadmill.

379
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:12,497
Once you stop running even
for a moment, you'll fall off.

380
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:15,828
Even pregnancy can't stop me.

381
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:19,398
I guess it can.

382
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:25,178
I'm a motorboat at heart,
but my body is a pedalo.

383
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:41,058
It has been a while.

384
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:42,727
This must have been tough on you.

385
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:44,687
It is okay.

386
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:54,908
You completed the book on tactics.

387
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:57,237
These men have never lifted
weapons in their lives.

388
00:29:57,507 --> 00:29:59,477
So it will be difficult to
turn them into soldiers.

389
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,338
But this will help.

390
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,217
Be careful.

391
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:19,428
I was not aware that the increase...

392
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:21,898
in the number of believers was that high.

393
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:25,037
In other words, a lot of
people must be struggling...

394
00:30:25,037 --> 00:30:26,967
due to oppression.

395
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:30,808
Lately, they are attracting
a variety of classes...

396
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:33,078
from ruined noblemen and herb diggers.

397
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:35,207
Perhaps, like My Queen said,

398
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:38,818
is the abolition of the social
strata the only solution?

399
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:41,378
We must be wary of...

400
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:43,648
a radical idea too.

401
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:46,717
Of course, it is too far in the future.

402
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:49,628
I may not be able to do so, but perhaps,

403
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,658
my child will be able to.

404
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:04,568
Your Highness, His Majesty...

405
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:07,108
Do not wake her.

406
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:18,358
She is like a baby.

407
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:30,267
JOURNAL FOR PRENATAL EDUCATION

408
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:32,437
YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR ENEMIES CLOSE TO YOU.

409
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:38,308
BABY, YOU MUST HAVE A TREASURY
WITH YOUR MONEY IN SECRECY.

410
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:44,547
LIFE IS A REAL GAME. THE WORLD IS A JUNGLE.

411
00:31:44,547 --> 00:31:46,578
YOU'LL GET EATEN IF YOU DON'T
EAT OTHERS. A SLAUGHTER PARTY!

412
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:48,277
"Party"?

413
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:50,687
Par...

414
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,457
I cannot figure out what "ty" means.

415
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:57,358
"Party".

416
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:05,138
As the Queen is safe, you were not harmed.

417
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:09,138
I knew it. The talisman I
got was definitely effective.

418
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:11,707
Thank you, Your Highness.

419
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:12,737
Then, I believe...

420
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:16,408
you did your due diligence to
spread the story I told you.

421
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:18,517
That cannot be.

422
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,378
You guys are so diligent this morning.

423
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:23,918
Did you even wash up before
you started to gossip?

424
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:27,088
You should listen to this. I bet
it will chase away your sleep.

425
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:30,787
You know the Queen...

426
00:32:35,128 --> 00:32:36,197
That is what I heard.

427
00:32:36,197 --> 00:32:39,937
What? His Majesty and the Queen
faked spending the night together?

428
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:44,467
His Majesty and the Queen faked
spending the night together.

429
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:54,348
I heard that they actually do not make love.

430
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,318
I heard they only spend
the night in the same room.

431
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:02,328
What? Then whose baby is she carrying?

432
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:05,227
Whose baby is she carrying,
if not the King's?

433
00:33:05,227 --> 00:33:07,457
- No way.
- I heard it was all fake.

434
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:25,647
You must have heard the rumor
circulating in the palace.

435
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:28,018
Rumors are always one step
slower than the truth.

436
00:33:28,317 --> 00:33:30,118
That was ancient history.

437
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:33,518
Rumors should not be taken
lightly at the palace.

438
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:36,728
They may use that as an excuse to depose you.

439
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,627
All they ever try to do is get me deposed.

440
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:40,728
They're playing dirty and being petty.

441
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,467
I won't let them kick me out.

442
00:33:42,998 --> 00:33:44,328
- Yes.
- Hong Yeon.

443
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:50,467
What are you doing with your hairpin?

444
00:34:14,757 --> 00:34:17,397
What is up with this provocative pose?

445
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:18,998
We must quash the rumor.

446
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:21,697
- My goodness.
- Goodness.

447
00:34:21,697 --> 00:34:23,237
- I am blushing. I cannot watch it.
- Gosh.

448
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:27,538
In that case...

449
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:32,678
This won't be enough to quash that rumor.

450
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:35,188
We must give them a good show.

451
00:34:35,188 --> 00:34:37,087
This is a bit too much.

452
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:39,458
But you are not as good as me.

453
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,527
Not enough.

454
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,998
Come on. Get into it.

455
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:58,908
If I get into it more than
this, we might need a tent.

456
00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:01,377
Is that what you want?

457
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:03,348
I never said that.

458
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:05,147
We just need to put on a show for them.

459
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,178
Then, for the same purpose,

460
00:35:09,388 --> 00:35:11,217
I will visit you in Daejojeon Hall.

461
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:22,728
I have no choice as I might get deposed.

462
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:23,728
Then,

463
00:35:25,027 --> 00:35:26,737
see you later.

464
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:40,917
- Did they leave?
- They are so slow.

465
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,717
They are still watching us.

466
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:44,987
Then, you leave me no choice.

467
00:36:06,237 --> 00:36:09,047
Your Highness, Royal
Noble Consort Eui is here.

468
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,288
Is it your doing?

469
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:25,897
- What do you mean?
- I mean, the rumor.

470
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:29,797
It is all thanks to you.

471
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:33,998
I was reminded of what you
told me a long time ago.

472
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:38,368
You told me that their spending
the night together was all a show.

473
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:43,478
Thanks to that, the Queen's
pregnancy will not be celebrated.

474
00:36:43,947 --> 00:36:45,777
Your words...

475
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,748
became an arrow and hit the Queen.

476
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:50,618
Please stop this.

477
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:52,888
It is out of my hand now.

478
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:55,857
Once people begin to spread rumors,

479
00:36:55,857 --> 00:36:57,958
they become irrevocable from
the very nature of things.

480
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:03,428
And now, it is too late for
you to wash your hands of it.

481
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:10,038
As long as you are here,
you will not be free.

482
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:15,877
Your existence itself will be used
to help the standing of our clan.

483
00:37:16,578 --> 00:37:19,848
I advise you to take the lead
rather than being exploited.

484
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:24,888
It scares me.

485
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,087
It is understandable.

486
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:33,627
However, you are not alone. So do not worry.

487
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:46,078
That I was turning into someone like you.

488
00:37:46,837 --> 00:37:48,038
That is what scares me.

489
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:52,877
Do you know why the clan
is following your lead?

490
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:56,118
Because you are an innocent
victim whose heart broke...

491
00:37:56,118 --> 00:37:57,947
from losing her child.

492
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:00,688
However, what if you were
a coldhearted mother...

493
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:02,928
who caused her son to die,
so she could save herself?

494
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,928
And on top of that, what if
you were a foolish woman...

495
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:07,228
who got deceived by shamanistic beliefs...

496
00:38:07,228 --> 00:38:09,467
and relies on the shaman
regarding our clan's future?

497
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,138
Will they still see you
as the leader of our clan?

498
00:38:13,768 --> 00:38:16,667
I will write down everything
I have heard and seen here,

499
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,667
so everyone in Joseon will
know exactly who you are.

500
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:24,377
Words do not have such power.

501
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:27,417
You will find out how strong they can be.

502
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:32,158
You once told me that you do
not wish to regret it again.

503
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:34,058
You do not deserve to regret...

504
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:36,428
failing to stop the late king's death.

505
00:38:36,788 --> 00:38:39,027
You must regret trampling on his dream.

506
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:42,928
You should regret ruining your son's dream...

507
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:44,728
as his mother.

508
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,638
The late king was probably
desperate to escape...

509
00:38:48,397 --> 00:38:50,337
from your shadow.

510
00:38:50,337 --> 00:38:51,337
What...

511
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:55,178
You know nothing.

512
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:59,018
How dare you run your mouth?

513
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:00,518
It is the truth everyone knows.

514
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:03,788
And I am sure you know that too.

515
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:08,458
I will not let you trample on
His Majesty's dream as well.

516
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:13,428
That wench...

517
00:39:26,178 --> 00:39:27,638
I am going to Daejojeon Hall.

518
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:29,007
Yes, Your Highness.

519
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:44,658
They say that rumors and
dreams are the opposite.

520
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,158
Rumors?

521
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,027
I did not tell anyone...

522
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:51,998
about sleeping with the King
as it is a personal matter,

523
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:56,808
but if you find out, you will be surprised.

524
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:00,138
At night...

525
00:40:25,868 --> 00:40:27,138
Like this.

526
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:29,808
It is a hot personal matter,
so I cannot speak of it.

527
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:31,607
It is so frustrating.

528
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:35,808
The King is different from what he seems.

529
00:40:36,348 --> 00:40:39,547
He is the king of stamina
that will go down in history.

530
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:46,317
Did it get recorded in history
like that because of me?

531
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:50,788
Who could have spread such a false rumor?

532
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:54,658
The only person to do such a thing
is the Royal Noble Consort Eui.

533
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,967
It's okay.

534
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,877
What? What do you want to
fight with me about now?

535
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:20,817
Are you confident?

536
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:27,458
Are you confident that...

537
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:30,527
you can fight against them
with the King and win?

538
00:41:32,897 --> 00:41:34,397
This is my fight too.

539
00:41:34,897 --> 00:41:36,938
I have a reason to win too.

540
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:48,518
Then you should practice shooting arrows.

541
00:41:49,217 --> 00:41:52,757
With your current skills,
you will only be a burden.

542
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:58,857
Then can you teach me?

543
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,527
I...

544
00:42:05,297 --> 00:42:07,167
do not have time to do so.

545
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:13,438
Your Majesty, the Royal
Noble Consort Eui is here.

546
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:15,877
Tell her to come in.

547
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:31,058
I have a request for you.

548
00:42:31,357 --> 00:42:32,357
Tell me.

549
00:42:32,357 --> 00:42:34,027
You must fulfill it.

550
00:42:35,627 --> 00:42:37,498
What kind of request is it?

551
00:42:39,438 --> 00:42:42,768
Please let me leave the Palace.

552
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:48,438
What do you mean by that?

553
00:42:48,877 --> 00:42:52,417
I cannot find myself inside this Palace.

554
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:55,047
Please remove me from the Palace...

555
00:42:55,618 --> 00:42:57,647
so that I can live as myself.

556
00:42:59,717 --> 00:43:00,917
I cannot allow that.

557
00:43:01,357 --> 00:43:04,288
You know what it means to live as
a disposed royal noble consort.

558
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:06,527
I do not care about what others say of me.

559
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:10,467
No, I will no longer be
bound by those things.

560
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:16,138
This is my final request, so please allow it.

561
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:25,078
I do not give you royal permission.
I cannot grant you royal permission.

562
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,217
You and I cherish one another,

563
00:43:29,248 --> 00:43:31,487
but we do not love each other anymore.

564
00:43:32,147 --> 00:43:33,558
I am just...

565
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,087
trapped in the royal villa...

566
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:39,757
under the name of a royal noble consort.

567
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:25,067
Your Majesty. All of the
ministers have gathered.

568
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:33,047
The reason I have called
all the ministers here...

569
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:38,317
is that I have an important
announcement to make.

570
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,158
As of this moment,

571
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:51,897
Jo Hwa Jin, Senior First
Rank Royal Noble Consort Eui,

572
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:58,237
will be disposed from her position
as Royal Noble Consort Eui.

573
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:08,248
We must stop this.

574
00:45:09,388 --> 00:45:13,788
The Royal Nobel Consort
Eui is no longer one of us.

575
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:22,797
Your Majesty, please stay healthy.

576
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:27,938
I will pray for your future.

577
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:48,388
Your Highness.

578
00:45:55,428 --> 00:45:58,498
Please do not call me that anymore.

579
00:45:58,498 --> 00:45:59,897
This is wrong.

580
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:02,467
His Majesty must not do this to you.

581
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:04,237
I asked him to do this.

582
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,938
- Why?
- It is what is best for everyone.

583
00:46:09,848 --> 00:46:13,248
As long as I am in the Palace, I
will get in the way of the King...

584
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:15,848
regardless of whether I want to or not.

585
00:46:15,848 --> 00:46:17,788
I will make sure that does not happen.

586
00:46:18,518 --> 00:46:20,158
There is still time to take it back.

587
00:46:20,158 --> 00:46:21,888
I will go tell the King...

588
00:46:23,857 --> 00:46:25,998
I cannot trust myself any longer.

589
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:31,297
If I stay here much longer,
I may lose myself completely.

590
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,538
I pretended not to know...

591
00:46:37,768 --> 00:46:40,007
how you felt about me.

592
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:46,377
- Your Highness.
- I used your feelings for me.

593
00:46:47,877 --> 00:46:50,288
As much as I longed for the King,

594
00:46:51,118 --> 00:46:53,987
I filled the emptiness I felt when
the King did not long for me...

595
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:57,087
through you.

596
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:58,627
I...

597
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,967
I willingly allowed you to use me.

598
00:47:05,397 --> 00:47:07,197
The only thing I could give you...

599
00:47:09,337 --> 00:47:10,607
was that.

600
00:47:11,638 --> 00:47:13,178
Thank you.

601
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:15,708
And...

602
00:47:16,978 --> 00:47:18,507
I'm sorry.

603
00:47:19,518 --> 00:47:21,317
You should also stop...

604
00:47:21,678 --> 00:47:25,018
hurting yourself by loving the wrong person.

605
00:47:45,268 --> 00:47:47,678
That's what she meant by that.

606
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:55,947
She is a cool woman.

607
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:00,917
Is Cheoljong okay?

608
00:48:02,788 --> 00:48:04,587
I'm sure he's not.

609
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:29,217
Do a round with me.

610
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:30,788
I am not in the mood to do so.

611
00:48:30,947 --> 00:48:31,987
When we were young,

612
00:48:33,217 --> 00:48:35,417
there was a game that we
played often in Ganghwa Island.

613
00:48:37,888 --> 00:48:40,598
The game where the one who steps
on the other's shadow first wins.

614
00:48:41,357 --> 00:48:42,797
If you do not want to do it,

615
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,337
you can just lose.

616
00:49:11,127 --> 00:49:12,527
Do you remember?

617
00:49:13,228 --> 00:49:16,667
When we were young, I always won.

618
00:49:19,938 --> 00:49:22,868
I remember always winning later on.

619
00:49:26,237 --> 00:49:30,348
I should have been stricter in
determining our hierarchy early on.

620
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:33,647
It is not that you did not determine
our hierarchy, you could not do it.

621
00:49:42,618 --> 00:49:46,697
Royal Noble Consort Eui worried
about you until the end.

622
00:49:46,857 --> 00:49:49,228
You who do not even know how valuable it is.

623
00:49:49,228 --> 00:49:50,368
It is not that I do not know.

624
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:52,598
That is why I am distressed.

625
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:05,578
You should be more distressed.

626
00:50:06,447 --> 00:50:07,518
That is...

627
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:11,487
the best you can do for Her Highness.

628
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:22,098
How much more do I have to
be lonely and distressed?

629
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:23,928
How much more?

630
00:50:37,961 --> 00:50:41,301
My Jong, is he drinking somewhere?

631
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,071
I would've been drinking with
him if I weren't pregnant.

632
00:50:49,111 --> 00:50:53,180
Is being pregnant not bearing
a baby but becoming one?

633
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,321
Why do I keep feeling sleepy?

634
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:13,470
I will go to Tongmyeongjeon Hall.

635
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:16,200
You must be careful, Your Highness.

636
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:18,401
As the rumor is dangerous,

637
00:51:18,401 --> 00:51:21,071
if they find out that the
origin is Your Highness...

638
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:24,910
Before Grand Queen Dowager hears about it,

639
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,310
I should tell her myself.

640
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:30,350
- But...
- Do not worry, Court Lady Ahn.

641
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,091
They will never imagine...

642
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,890
I will share the rumor I started myself.

643
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:42,330
You came without my invitation.

644
00:51:42,691 --> 00:51:44,700
I guess you have a favor to ask.

645
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,001
Hearing such a shocking rumor,

646
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:50,140
I was worried you might have been surprised.

647
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,841
That is why I came immediately.

648
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:54,211
A rumor?

649
00:51:56,481 --> 00:52:00,450
Why do you always chase such endeavors?

650
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:04,381
If you hear what it is, you
would not say so that easily.

651
00:52:05,321 --> 00:52:06,751
It does make me wonder.

652
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:10,490
What kind of rumor it is for you
to run to me with such excitement.

653
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,260
It is too good to miss.

654
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,031
The expression on your face
after hearing the rumor.

655
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:22,401
Rumors hardly make me wear
a facial expression...

656
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,870
you want to see.

657
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,810
The baby the Queen is pregnant
with is not a royal blood.

658
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,781
It is Kim Byeong In's child.

659
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:42,191
You cared for your family so much.

660
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,861
History will say The Andong Kim clan...

661
00:52:46,861 --> 00:52:49,290
is the family who stained royal blood.

662
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,781
It is interesting.

663
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,051
It makes things very interesting.

664
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,790
Hey, did you hear the rumor?

665
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,290
I already heard. A baseless rumor.

666
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,501
His Majesty and Her Highness bedded...

667
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,970
bedded properly. Why are you
bringing it up so belatedly?

668
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,341
That is not what I was going to say.

669
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,901
They say the baby is not His Majesty's.

670
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,671
You will get in trouble for saying that.

671
00:53:45,281 --> 00:53:47,921
The entire palace is laughing at our family.

672
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:50,060
Adultery between the Queen
and Minister of War...

673
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,321
who are close relatives?

674
00:53:53,091 --> 00:53:55,330
I had high hopes for him.

675
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,631
My goodness.

676
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:00,700
After Royal Noble Consort Eui was deposed,

677
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,930
I thought it was over for me.

678
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:06,401
But hearing the rumor about
the Queen, I feel like I won.

679
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:12,910
The baby was not a royal
blood but a cuckoo's chick.

680
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:36,571
My family is more important than my own life.

681
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,111
That is why I live for my family.

682
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:43,441
What do you live for?

683
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,240
I also live for the same
thing as you, Your Highness.

684
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,080
Is that so?

685
00:54:50,481 --> 00:54:53,390
If so, will you do anything
if it is for your family?

686
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,390
Yes, Your Highness.

687
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:59,490
Then bring the Queen's head to me at once.

688
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:01,890
It is the order of the family.

689
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:04,901
What is the reason?

690
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,671
The Queen destroyed the honor...

691
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:09,600
our family maintained for hundreds of years.

692
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:13,970
Your Highness.

693
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,740
I do not know what infuriated you,

694
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,211
but I ask for your mercy.

695
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:20,111
Everyone in the palace spread gossip...

696
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:22,850
that the King and the Queen
had not actually bedded.

697
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,751
Now they are saying the
baby in her belly is yours.

698
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,490
What?

699
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,021
That is not true.

700
00:55:30,021 --> 00:55:32,321
What everyone believes becomes the truth.

701
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:36,290
If the dawn breaks and people
move around and spread the rumor,

702
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:39,131
the Queen will become a sinner...

703
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:40,771
who is pregnant from adultery...

704
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:43,941
and lied he is King's to stain royal blood.

705
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,540
The rumor started because of me.

706
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,470
I will receive the punishment.

707
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,310
A rumor can hurt a man.

708
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,640
But a rumor can kill a woman.

709
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,080
What we need to save the
honor of our family...

710
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,651
is the head of the Queen.

711
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:59,720
If you cut her throat by
yourself and bring the head,

712
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,191
I will not punish you.

713
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:04,921
I cannot do that, Your Highness.

714
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,890
Please punish me instead.

715
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,260
You said you live for the family,

716
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,501
but you live for the Queen!

717
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:15,031
Then I will have to ask
you to do something else.

718
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,301
- Is anyone there?
- Immediately,

719
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,711
I will make your regency begin again.

720
00:56:56,611 --> 00:56:58,640
You made a contact with a dangerous thing.

721
00:56:59,881 --> 00:57:02,611
In a book with the Queen's name,

722
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:07,051
I saw the cipher of Donghak
believers in your handwriting.

723
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,461
A dangerous idea stained
the King and the Queen.

724
00:57:16,731 --> 00:57:18,801
And they are planning to reform the country.

725
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:23,100
What will happen if the
aristocrats sense the danger?

726
00:57:23,571 --> 00:57:25,470
They will try to keep Joseon as it is now,

727
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:28,111
even if it takes the lives
of the people in the country.

728
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:33,450
A massacre against Donghak
believers will begin.

729
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:39,720
If so, why did you come to me,
not carry it out immediately?

730
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,191
Because it will hurt the Queen as well.

731
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,501
The Andong Kim clan...

732
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:55,600
is targeting Her Highness.

733
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:01,140
With the rumor the Queen became
pregnant from adultery with me,

734
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,881
they are trying to kill her for the honor.

735
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,310
They are doing it to attack me.

736
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,251
- I will stop them.
- You cannot stop them.

737
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,421
Even if her life is spared for now,

738
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,620
if her own family attacks her with the rumor,

739
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:21,490
she will have to be living
with a damaged reputation.

740
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:26,160
Not only Her Highness, but the
royal baby will also live like that.

741
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,401
Can you not see how the
officials who can do anything...

742
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:35,341
to threaten your position will dog her?

743
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,251
You are the only one who
can save Her Highness.

744
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,821
What is it?

745
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:48,921
The way I can save her.

746
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,461
Put down the uprising.

747
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,060
With your own hands,

748
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:58,031
punish Donghak believers.

749
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:02,901
Defamation against the woman
of the King who went to war...

750
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:06,071
to protect the country is not
right, which will quash the rumor.

751
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:10,481
If you prove you are not part of
Donghak believers by killing them,

752
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,481
the cipher in Dongmongseonseup
cannot threaten you.

753
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,251
This...

754
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,220
is the only way...

755
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,790
to save Her Highness and
your baby in her womb.

756
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:32,301
You have no time to hesitate.

757
00:59:33,301 --> 00:59:35,830
When the dawn breaks, Her Highness
will be eaten up by the rumor.

758
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,470
I will never...

759
00:59:41,771 --> 00:59:44,211
let her get hurt alone.

760
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,680
I'm not sleeping.

761
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,180
I'm thinking for a moment.

762
01:00:20,381 --> 01:00:23,180
Why are you doing this, not
lying down for your comfort?

763
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:25,620
I came to comfort you.

764
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,021
But I fell deep in thoughts.

765
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,990
I'm so sleepy.

766
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:36,330
I will comfort you tomorrow.

767
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,510
You are my comfort.

768
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,100
As the uprising in Sam Nam
has put the country in danger,

769
01:01:50,131 --> 01:01:52,501
I am leaving in a hurry.

770
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,810
While I am gone, please
take care of the politics.

771
01:01:57,810 --> 01:01:58,941
And...

772
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,350
me and the Queen's baby as well.

773
01:02:06,281 --> 01:02:08,950
I believe you will take good care of him.

774
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:12,191
I have had a comfortable life
without being involved in politics.

775
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,461
I have no other choice.

776
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,631
Do not worry about the
Queen while you are gone.

777
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:21,731
Taking care of a woman who is left alone...

778
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:26,441
as her husband went to a war
risking his life is my duty.

779
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,910
I will count you on that...

780
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,781
and leave.

781
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,711
Please take care of yourself.

782
01:02:37,281 --> 01:02:39,551
The sun rose already.

783
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:08,950
Your Majesty.

784
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:13,180
I will do the rest.

785
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,151
Your Majesty.

786
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:29,071
Is it true that you will go to
quell the uprising yourself?

787
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,501
It is true.

788
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:32,001
What is going on, Your Majesty?

789
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:34,711
His Majesty who has been supporting
the people are going to kill them?

790
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:37,580
Kim Byeong In found out about
the cipher in Dongmongseonseup.

791
01:03:39,881 --> 01:03:43,450
If I do not go now, millions
of people will get hurt.

792
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:44,781
I will follow you, Your Majesty.

793
01:03:46,751 --> 01:03:49,091
Going by myself was the deal.

794
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,821
Is it not enough to have me as a hostage?

795
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:54,731
This is a trap.

796
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,990
Do you not think that it is the Queen...

797
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:59,401
who handed Dongmongseonseup to Kim Byeong In?

798
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:01,830
You promised me.

799
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:05,140
If there is clear evidence
that the Queen is our enemy,

800
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,540
you will cut her head off.

801
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:10,341
What you should cut off is not
the heads of the people but hers.

802
01:04:10,341 --> 01:04:12,910
The Queen is clearly not our enemy.

803
01:04:13,781 --> 01:04:16,950
The Queen turned against
everyone just to be on my side.

804
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:19,021
If I do not leave immediately,

805
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:21,950
the Queen will die.

806
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:24,591
Please calm down. It is not the time
for us to fight against each other.

807
01:04:27,191 --> 01:04:29,430
You said I should be more distressed.

808
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,200
You are right.

809
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,700
I will bear everything.

810
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,441
Your life...

811
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:43,711
is in danger, Your Majesty.

812
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:48,151
If I try to live,

813
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:51,251
everyone will die.

814
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:14,640
I'm sure I've seen him.

815
01:05:16,611 --> 01:05:17,781
Is it a dream?

816
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:26,151
Court Lady Choi. Hong Yeon.

817
01:05:32,091 --> 01:05:34,461
Let's go to Daejojeon Hall.
I guess we missed each other.

818
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,930
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

819
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:38,861
His Majesty is leaving right now.

820
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:41,531
He's leaving? To where?

821
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:52,841
We will be off now.

822
01:06:16,331 --> 01:06:17,741
Wait!

823
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:30,880
Stop! Hold on!

824
01:06:37,821 --> 01:06:38,960
Why?

825
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:42,590
Why?

826
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:50,640
Is this the right path?

827
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,210
I do not think it is the
path made for people.

828
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,441
We are taking the shortcut, Your Majesty.

829
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,271
Halt.

830
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,840
You are late.

831
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:36,111
If you were going to do this anyway,
you could have done it quicker.

832
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:40,180
Will you get off the horse
yourself? Or do you need help?

833
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,071
I have no place to back off.

834
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:58,000
There is nothing I can do except do my best.

835
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,401
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

836
01:08:02,241 --> 01:08:04,140
I can handle it by myself.

837
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:09,481
Everything will be fine if I get rid of you.

838
01:08:59,161 --> 01:09:00,331
MR. QUEEN

839
01:09:00,331 --> 01:09:01,600
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

840
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,771
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

841
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,890
<i>This little thing eats so much.</i>

842
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,491
<i>Say "Daddy, please come back soon."</i>

843
01:09:27,491 --> 01:09:28,791
<i>I think it just kicked.</i>

844
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,861
<i>Your Highness, the King...</i>

845
01:09:31,861 --> 01:09:33,930
<i>The owner of that seat is changing now.</i>

846
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,130
<i>What is the point of all of this...</i>

847
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,071
<i>when you're not here?</i>

848
01:09:38,071 --> 01:09:39,340
<i>You have not committed any crimes, you said.</i>

849
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,970
<i>Standing on the side of
the weak is also a crime.</i>

850
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:43,241
<i>Byeong In. How far are you going to go?</i>

851
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:46,481
<i>More importantly, come into
this world in good health.</i>

852
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,411
<i>I will take the life of the Queen...</i>

853
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:51,481
<i>who joined you in taking the King's life.</i>
