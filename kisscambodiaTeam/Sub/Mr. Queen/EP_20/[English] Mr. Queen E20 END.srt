FINAL EPISODE

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,865
Stop.

5
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,340
- Search it.
- Yes, sir!

6
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,489
There is nothing suspicious.

7
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,830
We have arrived.

8
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,310
Check all the wagons with the
gifts for the King thoroughly.

9
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,810
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,720
- Your Highness!
- Head Inspector.

11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,590
How...

12
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:51,730
Your Majesty!

13
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,140
I finally caught that little rat.

14
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,510
When does the ceremony start?

15
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,709
- In the afternoon.
- Then we have some time, right?

16
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,439
We should not let our
guard down. Let us hurry.

17
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:08,249
Hold on.

18
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:16,690
- What was that for?
- I don't know.

19
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:25,899
I am sure we have enough time for this.

20
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:28,799
- We should really get going.
- Okay.

21
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:40,580
EPISODE 20, MY LIFE WITHOUT ME

22
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,200
Your Majesty.

23
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,410
Wait. I am not done cleaning up.

24
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,489
Oh, my goodness!

25
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,160
Your Majesty.

26
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,630
How wronged must you feel...

27
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:34,630
for your soul to be
wandering around the palace?

28
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,369
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,940
Head Eunuch.

30
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,610
Come with me.

31
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,779
With you?

32
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,149
Go away!

33
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,619
Your Majesty. Please enter Nirvana.

34
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,059
You should come with me.

35
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,760
Your Highness.

36
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,799
Your Majesty.

37
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,029
Your Majesty! You are alive!

38
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:14,709
Your Majesty. What happened to you?

39
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,599
It goes well with your royal robe.

40
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,760
I have such good taste.

41
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Over there!

42
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,640
Over there!

43
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,589
You little jerk.

44
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,070
Oh, yes!

45
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,640
Why are you so good?

46
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,370
Shall I say it's a vibe
that comes from experience?

47
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,839
What comes from experience?

48
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm amazing with knives.

49
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,820
Do not attempt to do anything meaningless.

50
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,490
How many soldiers are protecting the Palace?

51
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,459
You are too late.

52
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,659
That is the sound that signifies
the start of the enthronement.

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,399
How dare you speak down to me!

54
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,979
The enthronement ceremony
is starting already?

55
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,120
Bow in reverence...

56
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,919
four times...

57
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,469
and sit upright.

58
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:38,880
I cannot believe they
started the ceremony early.

59
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:44,159
Hey. I have to tell you something.

60
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,459
I set up a backup plan just in case.

61
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,729
What are you doing? Hurry up and continue.

62
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,729
The thing is...

63
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,399
the Royal seal has disappeared!

64
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,479
The Royal seal is missing!

65
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:03,500
I must have lost my mind.

66
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,839
I got overexcited upon hearing
that it was a special mission.

67
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,539
Raise your head.

68
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,580
I am offering my greetings to
you for the first time, Your...

69
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:20,419
Highness?

70
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:24,390
Lee Saeng Mang.

71
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,830
You are Lee Saeng Mang.
Have you lost your mind?

72
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,589
Or have I lost my mind?

73
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:36,070
You had the Royal seal stolen?

74
00:08:36,869 --> 00:08:38,369
I'm a bit crazy, you know.

75
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,170
That means we still have a chance.

76
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,349
- Let us go.
- Okay.

77
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,959
I was able to do it last time.

78
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,900
- Do it properly.
- Be quiet.

79
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,369
Why you...

80
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:13,639
Special Director Hong.

81
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,879
Is it you again?

82
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,310
I told you not to come!

83
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,650
The thing is...

84
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,619
I do not have anyone I could ask.

85
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,790
The Queen had asked me to
steal something for her.

86
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,739
This bright and precious-looking item...

87
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,739
seems quite ominous.

88
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,070
What is that?

89
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,509
The Royal seal.

90
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Do you know...

91
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,180
where you came after stealing the Royal seal?

92
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,580
This is the Department of Justice...

93
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,190
Did I come to prison on my own volition?

94
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,999
Why are you giving this to me?

95
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,400
What are you doing here?

96
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,940
I came by to see my friend.

97
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,609
You must not be here. Please leave right now.

98
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,080
Hold on!

99
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,180
Who dares lay a hand on my best friend?

100
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,450
Have you lost your mind?

101
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,050
How could you blatantly
reveal the Royal seal?

102
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:38,690
"The Royal seal"?

103
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,719
Do you want to take a look at it?

104
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,469
- It is a bomb!
- Everybody run!

105
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,209
They passed the gates of Hanyang
and all the gates to the capital?

106
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,410
Yes, sir. If you give us the
orders to use the cannons...

107
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,680
Finishing the enthronement without
a problem is most important,

108
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,979
so hold off on using the cannons.

109
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,420
And send all of the soldiers
to each of the capital gates.

110
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,589
Hurry!

111
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:24,729
Once the enthronement ceremony ends,

112
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:28,270
I will get rid of all of them.

113
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,839
How can we hold the enthronement
without the Royal seal?

114
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,639
Goodness. How could such a thing happen?

115
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,180
What on earth are you doing?

116
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,650
How can you be so useless?

117
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,660
What is it?

118
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,290
So?

119
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,259
As of right now, it is
hard for us to attack...

120
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,969
due to an unidentifiable acrid smoke.

121
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,400
Since the enthronement must
end without any problems,

122
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,639
I have sent soldiers to each
gate to stop them completely.

123
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,540
It is a confusion tactic.

124
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,639
What is it?

125
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,180
A CONFUSION TACTIC TO FEINT TO
THE EAST AND ATTACK IN THE WEST.

126
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:16,910
It is nothing.

127
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,020
I will bring the Royal seal myself.

128
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,389
Call the soldiers back
into the Palace right now.

129
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,719
- Pardon?
- Did you not hear me?

130
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,629
Yes, sir.

131
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,839
It's so empty in here.

132
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,139
I see things are going
according to our plans.

133
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,349
We have come all the way here.

134
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,020
Are you scared?

135
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,830
I am, and I am...

136
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,900
overwhelmed.

137
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,430
Right. This is how you feel...

138
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,499
right before you face the boss in a game.

139
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,739
That is correct. The boss.

140
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:15,270
If you die before you can beat
the boss, you end up cursing...

141
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,009
because you have to start
from the beginning again.

142
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,379
We only get one chance.

143
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,950
Gosh. I'm getting scared.

144
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,389
Shall we get going?

145
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,489
He caught him.

146
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,160
My Queen!

147
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:15,629
I'm okay. It's because
the noise surprised me.

148
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:17,099
It doesn't hurt.

149
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,139
My Queen!

150
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:26,540
My Queen!

151
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,520
My Queen! Do not move.

152
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,719
We have to stop the ceremony.

153
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,259
You come first.

154
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,030
I must take a look at the injury.

155
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,349
My King.

156
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,469
Am I going back?

157
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,879
No.

158
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,240
Why now of all times?

159
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,010
Please...

160
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,220
After I see that he's alive.

161
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,990
Let me just make sure he's okay.

162
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,980
DANGER, RISK OF FALLING

163
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,659
Is it my body? Am I back?

164
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:58,560
What about Cheoljong?

165
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,810
No. I must save him.

166
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,240
But how can I?

167
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,480
That happened 200 years ago.

168
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,409
VIP WARD

169
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,040
What? Jang Bong Hwan?

170
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,349
Mr. Jang Bong Hwan!

171
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,280
Jang Bong Hwan? The patient?

172
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:56,449
Stop!

173
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,260
You can't run like that! You just woke up!

174
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,619
Mr. Jang Bong Hwan!

175
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,629
- Mr. Jang Bong Hwan!
- Go after him!

176
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:04,330
Mr. Jang Bong Hwan!

177
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,530
Stop right there!

178
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,669
Stop him!

179
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,570
- Stop him.
- Gosh. Why are you doing this?

180
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,609
Goodness.

181
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:17,909
Come on.

182
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,139
- What?
- Hey!

183
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:32,820
Darn his youth.

184
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,330
Was he really in a vegetative
state for a few months?

185
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:54,010

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,960
"VERITABLE RECORDS OF THE JOSEON DYNASTY"

188
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:13,859
Please don't die. You can't die like that.

189
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:16,730
THE 22ND KING OF THE JOSEON DYNASTY

190
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,540
THE ERA OF KING CHEOL...

191
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,210
THE ERA OF KING CHEOLJO'S DIRECT RULE

192
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,490
He is not here.

193
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,560
He is gone.

194
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,839
Your Majesty.

195
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,810
Your Majesty.

196
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,820
You cannot leave like this.

197
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,089
Please wake up, Your Majesty.

198
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,429
Your Majesty.

199
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:25,939
- Your Majesty.
- My Queen.

200
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,109
Are you okay?

201
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:30,169
I am okay.

202
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:33,679
But you are bleeding a lot.

203
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:35,949
Seeing how it is utterly painful,

204
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,980
I guess I will not die from it.

205
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,889
These bulletproof vests saved both of us.

206
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:47,220
Thank goodness.

207
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:31,639
What on earth are you doing?

208
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:33,639
How can the King sides
with the Donghak believers?

209
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:38,740
I guess...

210
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,949
I am still the King.

211
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:44,179
You should not have done anything.

212
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,250
If you accepted your place and stood still,

213
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,050
everyone would have been happy.

214
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,490
I am...

215
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,189
the family of those you killed.

216
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,199
I am the King of the people you trampled on!

217
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,980
Standing still is impossible.

218
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,010
You are out of breath.

219
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,520
I doubt that you can dodge my sword!

220
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,790
Your...

221
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,939
No. Please, my baby. Please.

222
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,099
Kill me.

223
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,030
Live.

224
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,500
Living in humiliation...

225
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,810
is your punishment.

226
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,149
If you kill yourself,

227
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:38,820
I will do whatever it takes to save you.

228
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:41,990
I do not care about the damage
or the pain I put you through.

229
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,859
But I will make sure that you are breathing.

230
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,399
Living like an empty shell.

231
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:50,199
That experience...

232
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:55,109
will be engraved deep in your bones.

233
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:32,953
What will you do? Hiding in
the crowd is your specialty,

234
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:36,424
but there isn't a single soul
walking by because of the curfew.

235
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:39,864
You no longer have anywhere to hide.

236
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:06,453
My Queen.

237
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:14,134
Go finish your fight first.

238
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,803
No, I will not do that.

239
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,533
Nothing matters more to me than you do.

240
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:21,503
Do not worry.

241
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,074
I will overcome this no matter what.

242
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,943
Your Majesty!

243
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:33,713
I will escort Her Highness.

244
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:35,654
You must go.

245
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:37,824
We do not know what will happen if we stall.

246
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:55,503
Please, you should go.

247
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,094
I will be back very soon.

248
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:22,533
Okay.

249
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:34,973
Your Highness.

250
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,443
Your Highness.

251
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:37,844
Are you all right?

252
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:04,904
Find a way!

253
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:09,844
You are all utterly useless!

254
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,533
Show your dignity as the King.

255
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:35,033
I am terrified, Grand Queen Dowager.

256
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,914
You ought to protect your position!

257
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,003
Out of the throne.

258
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:00,493
Grand Queen Dowager.

259
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:05,733
I shall greet you.

260
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:57,443
Greet His Majesty the King!

261
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,384
My Queen!

262
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:03,124
Her Highness is unconscious at the moment.

263
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:08,253
What happened?

264
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:11,263
Her Highness is showing signs of miscarriage.

265
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:14,263
There is some vaginal bleeding.

266
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:17,934
If it continues, both Her
Highness and the baby...

267
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:21,233
will not be safe.

268
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:27,713
Then why are you removing the needles?

269
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:33,584
At the moment, even this acupuncture
treatment is too much for her.

270
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:37,223
All we can do is wait and pray
that they will get through this.

271
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:41,624
She might not make it tonight.

272
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:49,634
- Your Highness! No!
- Your Highness...

273
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:57,743
Your Majesty. We are truly sorry,

274
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:01,443
but please leave the room for
a moment so we can treat her.

275
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,783
Your Majesty, we should give them a moment.

276
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,354
Your Highness!

277
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,254
Your Highness!

278
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:21,033
There is nothing I can do!

279
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:12,453
My Queen.

280
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:29,863
Both Her Highness and the baby are okay now.

281
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:39,714
Your Majesty.

282
00:34:43,544 --> 00:34:45,653
I am truly relieved. Both you and our baby...

283
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:50,823
You are both okay.

284
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,434
Your Majesty.

285
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,754
It is all over.

286
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:27,453
Who knew that the King was truly outstanding?

287
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,993
Your Highness!

288
00:35:34,294 --> 00:35:37,604
How dare you scream like
that? Where are your manners?

289
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:38,973
Well,

290
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:43,343
the King has given an order to
move you to the West Palace.

291
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:44,604
What?

292
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:48,214
How dare he try to confine
me at the West Palace?

293
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,044
Who does he think I am?

294
00:35:59,153 --> 00:36:01,223
What are you doing? Open the door now.

295
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:04,524
I cannot open the door, Your Highness.

296
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:17,573
Open this door immediately!

297
00:36:18,504 --> 00:36:20,944
The Queen is here.

298
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:45,973
Open it.

299
00:36:57,843 --> 00:36:59,484
I heard you were in critical
condition last night,

300
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:00,854
but you seem fine.

301
00:37:01,113 --> 00:37:03,184
It is all thanks to you.

302
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:06,153
Where are you going?

303
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:09,493
Must I report my whereabouts to you?

304
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,394
It has been decided that you
will stay in the West Palace.

305
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,164
Until then, stay at Tongmyeongjeon Hall...

306
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,363
and you are not allowed to go out.

307
00:37:18,004 --> 00:37:21,633
Are you telling me you
are locking me up here?

308
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,303
Do not be ridiculous.

309
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:27,473
Move!

310
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:30,414
You cannot leave.

311
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:33,113
I told you to move!

312
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:37,053
Your Highness.

313
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:43,993
If your last day comes,
it will be at the palace.

314
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:48,493
Court Lady Chun, what are you doing?

315
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:49,604
Yes, Your Highness.

316
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,343
How dare you?

317
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:58,343
This is no longer your era.

318
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:02,173
The ruler of the Internal Court...

319
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:04,113
is me.

320
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:06,283
I am the ruler.

321
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,513
I am still here!

322
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:10,453
It belongs to me!

323
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,493
From this day on, everything will change,

324
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:15,093
especially the rules and the etiquettes...

325
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,024
you made and maintained.

326
00:38:17,223 --> 00:38:20,834
They have been around for thousands of years!

327
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:24,464
Do you think you can
tear them down overnight?

328
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:27,334
They are already collapsing.

329
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:29,944
The change you have feared the most...

330
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:32,613
has already begun.

331
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:51,564
Darn it. That totally hit the spot!

332
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:53,964
Gosh.

333
00:38:54,694 --> 00:38:57,834
Court Lady Choi, what did I just say?

334
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:01,473
"Darn it. That totally hit the spot!"

335
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,703
That is what you said.

336
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:09,984
Perhaps, my hidden
instincts have been awoken.

337
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,484
That really hit the spot.

338
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,584
I cannot stop saying it. Darn it.

339
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:18,953
Shoot.

340
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:21,794
That felt nice.

341
00:39:23,624 --> 00:39:26,664
Darn it! Scumbags!

342
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,564
Darn it.

343
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:35,703
What is this about?

344
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,423
"The following offender, Jo,"

345
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,423
"spread a rumor to slander the Queen..."

346
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,323
"and brought doubts to the royal blood."

347
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,263
"In the end, she had
disgraced the royal family."

348
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:00,263
"You will be punished for
bringing confusion to the empire."

349
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:03,064
"You will be exiled in the West Palace."

350
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,203
This is another conspiracy.

351
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,374
I have never done such things.

352
00:40:11,374 --> 00:40:14,374
Are you telling the truth?

353
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,113
I swear it on the honor of the late king.

354
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:22,653
I have never done such things.

355
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,723
Come in.

356
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:50,613
"The following offenders'
assets will be confiscated."

357
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:52,283
"And they will be smacked 100 times..."

358
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,013
"and become the slaves of
the empire in Jeju Island."

359
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:56,754
"But their wives and children will
not be punished for their crimes."

360
00:40:58,154 --> 00:40:59,924
"Former Chief State Councilor Kim Byung Hak."

361
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:01,924
"Former Right State Councilor Jo Man Hong."

362
00:41:02,353 --> 00:41:04,094
"Former Left State Councilor Kim Seok Geun."

363
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,864
"Former Minister of War Kim Chang Hyup."

364
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:08,033
"Former Chief Secretariat Kim So Heun."

365
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:10,103
"Former Minister of Personnel Jo Deok Moon."

366
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:12,033
"And other offenders
listed on this decree..."

367
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,774
"will not be executed."

368
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,433
"Their assets will be confiscated."

369
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,774
"They will be imprisoned for three years."

370
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:22,013
- It is not true, Your Majesty.
- It is not true, Your Majesty.

371
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:25,183
We had no choice as we were threatened...

372
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:28,314
by Kim Byeong In who plotted
the whole thing alone.

373
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:31,524
We never wanted...

374
00:41:32,053 --> 00:41:35,723
to plot treason.

375
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,864
I ask for your mercy, Your Majesty.

376
00:41:39,024 --> 00:41:40,794
He is right, Your Majesty.

377
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:43,064
Our only crime is that...

378
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:45,973
we foolishly believed the false
news that you were killed...

379
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:49,444
by the Donghak believers. Our
foolishness is the only crime.

380
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:51,603
Is that so?

381
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,473
Then, I will name another
crime you have committed.

382
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:01,584
Right now, in Joseon,

383
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,223
the ones with a lot of
assets are the guilty ones.

384
00:42:05,953 --> 00:42:09,263
Is anyone here considered poor?

385
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:14,464
You filled your stomachs with
the hard work of the people.

386
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:16,964
You have forgotten your duty of
leading and taking care of...

387
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:18,703
the people by maintaining order.

388
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:21,703
You stood over the people
and trampled on them.

389
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:24,004
You made the people to farm...

390
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:26,044
on a rocky mountain by plowing the field.

391
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,743
And in exchange, you
extorted even more taxes.

392
00:42:29,584 --> 00:42:32,754
When you lived in luxury
with an abundance of food,

393
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:35,453
the people lived in poverty
and worried about food...

394
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:36,884
all night long.

395
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:38,783
"How can I get more money?"

396
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:40,254
"How can I get more power?"

397
00:42:40,254 --> 00:42:41,794
"How can I become more influential?"

398
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:43,194
When that was all you could think about,

399
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:45,663
their lives became nothing but pain.

400
00:42:46,234 --> 00:42:47,834
Thinking about their future was
the last thing on their mind.

401
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:51,263
They had to live in pure torment.

402
00:42:54,933 --> 00:42:56,603
Your first crime is...

403
00:42:56,603 --> 00:42:59,473
valuing your life more than the people's.

404
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,444
Your second crime is...

405
00:43:01,444 --> 00:43:03,814
torturing them and robbing
them of any future.

406
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:06,453
Making the fathers hopeless for
failing to protect their families...

407
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:08,413
and the King, his empire,

408
00:43:08,413 --> 00:43:10,484
is your third crime.

409
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:14,294
If you are not guilty of these crimes,

410
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:17,064
step forward.

411
00:43:23,064 --> 00:43:25,564
Never forget your crimes.

412
00:43:27,473 --> 00:43:28,634
And repent.

413
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,103
You are...

414
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,814
just a group of shameless thieves.

415
00:43:35,243 --> 00:43:37,183
But...

416
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:45,123
- What a jerk!
- He deserves death.

417
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,323
- My gosh.
- He should be ripped to pieces.

418
00:43:48,323 --> 00:43:50,094
- You ought to die!
- Scumbag!

419
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,493
- Jerk!
- You must be punished!

420
00:43:51,493 --> 00:43:54,094
- You deserve death!
- What a scumbag.

421
00:43:54,094 --> 00:43:55,433
- Goodness.
- Pay for what you did!

422
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:58,263
- He ought to die.
- What an awful man!

423
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,404
- Goodness.
- You deserve death!

424
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:25,524
Leave them here.

425
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:28,364
But you always wear makeup.

426
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:31,433
I know that you will never be
able to leave the West Palace...

427
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:33,404
or meet anyone.

428
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:34,873
But...

429
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:40,743
I kept you around...

430
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,114
because you carelessly reveal your thoughts.

431
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:47,283
You are not the type to
have ulterior motives.

432
00:44:48,984 --> 00:44:50,123
That is right.

433
00:44:51,283 --> 00:44:54,553
Everyone lives their lives differently.

434
00:44:54,723 --> 00:44:55,794
Your Highness.

435
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,794
Why are you not getting mad
at me like you always do?

436
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,634
You are so tactless until the very end.

437
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:09,973
Even I am holding in my
tears, so why are you crying?

438
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:11,973
Your Highness.

439
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:24,584
I will survive this.

440
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,323
Surviving this...

441
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:35,893
is the only way I can win.

442
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:32,484
Join hands with me, just until
you can get out of this unscathed.

443
00:46:33,094 --> 00:46:34,123
What are you up to?

444
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:35,453
If such memories are intact,

445
00:46:37,924 --> 00:46:40,194
So Yong is still alive inside you.

446
00:46:43,564 --> 00:46:46,033
You found me again, Byeong In.

447
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,674
Even when I was hiding.

448
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:37,424
- I apologize, Your Highness.
- I apologize, Your Highness.

449
00:47:38,384 --> 00:47:40,794
It is nice to hear the sounds of laughter.

450
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:44,924
- I apologize, Your Highness.
- I apologize, Your Highness.

451
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:52,533
You have changed a lot, Your Highness.

452
00:47:54,073 --> 00:47:56,544
I was not like myself for a while
after the Royal wedding, right?

453
00:47:58,404 --> 00:47:59,513
It is because...

454
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:04,714
becoming the Queen was
such a big change for me.

455
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:09,154
You have changed a lot from how
you were before the Royal wedding.

456
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,033
I thought that the only decision...

457
00:48:21,763 --> 00:48:23,904
I could make for myself was death.

458
00:48:42,413 --> 00:48:46,794
I CAME HERE FOR NOTHING. JANG BONG HWAN

459
00:48:48,794 --> 00:48:50,993
Have you returned well?

460
00:49:00,634 --> 00:49:02,433
Your Highness!

461
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:06,944
- Father!
- No!

462
00:49:07,373 --> 00:49:09,243
Your body must feel heavy,
so do not come to me.

463
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,683
I will go to you.

464
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:18,484
- How is your health?
- How is your health?

465
00:49:19,853 --> 00:49:21,553
You may speak first, Father.

466
00:49:21,553 --> 00:49:23,694
No, it is okay. You may go first.

467
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:25,723
- I am fine.
- I am fine.

468
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:33,573
Have you been well?

469
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:35,073
Of course.

470
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:36,703
I am alive thanks to you.

471
00:49:37,103 --> 00:49:38,743
When the rebel army...

472
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,344
penetrated the gates of
Hanyang during the ceremony.

473
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,873
all of the noblemen were in fear.

474
00:49:43,143 --> 00:49:46,783
The village people came forward
to protect our home then.

475
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:49,154
They said we were a virtuous family
who opened up our storehouse...

476
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:51,053
and helped them.

477
00:49:52,953 --> 00:49:56,194
All I did was do as you said,

478
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:59,064
so I felt sorry and embarrassed.

479
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,734
You can show your virtue from now on.

480
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:04,803
Of course.

481
00:50:05,763 --> 00:50:07,973
I must become a respectable grandfather...

482
00:50:07,973 --> 00:50:10,243
for your child.

483
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:15,243
Oh, my. He is kicking.

484
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:17,743
Is he already kicking?

485
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:26,094
My grandson must be a genius!

486
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:38,149
Is the scent of scallions too strong?

487
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,020
What are you so focused on making?

488
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:46,359
I am trying to recreate
the samhyang ramyeon...

489
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:47,689
that the Queen made.

490
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,259
Then may I have some ramyeon?

491
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,779
It will be done soon.

492
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,279
I thought I could take it easy
once the reign of peace started,

493
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,120
but I am busier than ever.

494
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,919
Nobody is here.

495
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:20,790
Special Director Hong.

496
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,489
I am busy. We can play tujeon later.

497
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,359
I have stopped playing tujeon.

498
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:27,930
You did?

499
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:34,770
Because I made such a big contribution,

500
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,339
the King has decided to
give me a government post.

501
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:40,910
But...

502
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,549
I am still Special Director Hong.

503
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,649
Did you ask for a position as a premier?

504
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,060
What is that object that makes you look ugly?

505
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:01,399
You are so unaware of new trends.

506
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,299
I have applied as a delegate
for the foreign ministry.

507
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,970
Joseon is too small for such
a talented person like me.

508
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,879
Congratulations on quitting tujeon.

509
00:52:23,419 --> 00:52:24,549
What about becoming a delegate?

510
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:26,250
Having to walk until you
get blisters on your feet...

511
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,959
is nothing to be congratulated for.

512
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:34,830
I still cannot believe that
Lee Saeng Mang is the Queen.

513
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,770
I still cannot believe that
you had not figured that out.

514
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,339
Du Il, Are you done with...

515
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,770
I see you were here too.

516
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,939
It has been a while Jong Cheol...

517
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,779
If Lee Saeng Mang is the
Queen, then Jong Cheol, you...

518
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:01,220
You must be a woman.

519
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,959
Gosh, Kim Hwan.

520
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:06,759
You are incredibly astute.

521
00:53:09,299 --> 00:53:11,970
I heard you received a government post.

522
00:53:12,529 --> 00:53:14,270
I received it from the King.

523
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:17,810
Oh, my goodness.

524
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,220
- Sam Wol, you should go in first.
- Yes, ma'am.

525
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,819
What brings you here?

526
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,689
It is so cold. Did you wait long?

527
00:53:36,689 --> 00:53:39,290
No. I just got...

528
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:43,029
What is wrong?

529
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:53,379
Just a cramp.

530
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,480
How is everything?

531
00:54:00,919 --> 00:54:01,919
Good.

532
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,450
All is well with His Majesty.

533
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,450
No.

534
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:07,890
I was asking about you.

535
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:12,330
I am...

536
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,140
Things are pretty stable
with Samjung Ijungchung now.

537
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:30,549
Thanks to it, I am swamped with work.

538
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:35,879
So? What is next?

539
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,290
I wish...

540
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:41,060
to share my power with every
single one of the people...

541
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,029
so they can be stronger than
me when they come together.

542
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:48,600
That way, the corrupt shall never
be able to exploit them again.

543
00:54:49,299 --> 00:54:51,799
I believe that is how
this difficult battle...

544
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,399
and this wonder-filled journey...

545
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,970
should end.

546
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,779
So you are saying I'll be even busier now.

547
00:55:00,779 --> 00:55:02,640
Let us call it a day.

548
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,209
My goodness.

549
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,919
Let us just go home.

550
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:10,649
You can go through that tomorrow morning.

551
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,890
We just don't click.

552
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,459
But you should tidy up before...

553
00:55:16,629 --> 00:55:18,129
- Have a restful night.
- Will do.

554
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,000
Du Il, you need to organize...

555
00:55:22,259 --> 00:55:23,299
Du Il!

556
00:55:23,629 --> 00:55:25,569
Gosh, that punk.

557
00:55:49,419 --> 00:55:52,160
THE QUEEN'S DICTIONARY

558
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,439
Did I lose something?

559
00:56:06,879 --> 00:56:08,810
From time to time, I feel...

560
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:13,419
He did it.

561
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,319
He managed to pull it off.

562
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:16,350
THE ERA OF KING CHEOLJO'S DIRECT RULE

563
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,899
THE ANNALS OF KING CHEOLJO

564
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:38,109
My Queen.

565
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,350
Is this not funny?

566
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:07,100
Jang Bong Hwan!

567
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,609
Don't come closer.

568
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:16,580
I must find Secretary Han first.

569
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,649
No, would it be the fastest to
just go directly to the media?

570
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:23,549
Why are you running away?
You did a good deed!

571
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,850
"Good deed"?

572
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,359
Then why are you keeping tabs on me?

573
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,359
No, we're trying to protect you because...

574
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,129
you sent us a tip for the
sake of public interest.

575
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:34,459
"Public interest"?

576
00:57:34,459 --> 00:57:37,770
Well, remember the CCTV
camera in the food storage?

577
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,529
You fixed it in secret.

578
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,069
I did?

579
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:48,839
Hold on.

580
00:57:57,089 --> 00:57:58,890
Do you manage the CCTV camera?

581
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:01,859
It's odd that it keeps breaking.

582
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:03,459
I must catch this thief.

583
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:07,060
Why did you do something so useless?

584
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,759
This is very unlike you.

585
00:58:08,759 --> 00:58:11,569
There you are. Why didn't you
come sooner to tell me this?

586
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:13,700
I already got myself in trouble.

587
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,040
- What?
- I sent the CCTV footage...

588
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,140
to the media for free,
which is very unlike me.

589
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:23,379
He's lying.

590
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,850
Yes, I'm sure.

591
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:28,680
The Jang Bong Hwan I know
doesn't care about justice.

592
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,520
He'd come to me and try...

593
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,959
to strike a deal before going
to the media. Am I wrong?

594
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,129
You're right.

595
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:39,330
That's the kind of jerk that I am.

596
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,129
But you know what?

597
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:44,230
- I've changed.
- Really?

598
00:58:45,069 --> 00:58:46,529
- Why?
- No idea.

599
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:48,470
I just wanted to do it.

600
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,980
You scumbag!

601
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,379
Chef Bu!

602
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,089
Chef Bu!

603
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,589
- Darn it.
- You jerk!

604
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:21,870
Cheoljong managed to change his fate,

605
00:59:22,169 --> 00:59:23,370
and I've changed too.

606
00:59:25,209 --> 00:59:27,009
Then how come Secretary
Han is still the same?

Don't tell me the world didn't change at all.

610
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,560
Are Cheoljong and I the
only ones that changed?

- Just a comment, please!

621
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,779
- Is it all true?
- Do you admit all the charges?

622
01:00:07,779 --> 01:00:10,020
- Are the allegations true?
- Is it all true?

01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:16,060
SECRETARY HAN PYO JIN COMMITTED
EMBEZZLEMENT FOR YEARS

624
01:00:19,959 --> 01:00:21,430
History goes on, and things change.

625
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:25,100
But those conniving rats who engage
in corruption always survive.

626
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:29,770
Maybe a good world isn't
completely devoid of rotten parts,

627
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:32,509
but it allows us to cut out
such corrupt, rotten segments.

628
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,540
If you keep trying to change
your life for the better,

629
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,410
you'll bring about positive
change to the world,

630
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:41,580
just like Cheoljong and I did.

631
01:01:00,899 --> 01:01:02,939
- Your Majesty.
- Yes.

632
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:04,239
It's upside down.

633
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:06,040
Oh, right.

634
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:14,120
Your Majesty, are you
having trouble focusing?

635
01:01:14,649 --> 01:01:16,750
I wish to see my Queen so much...

636
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,919
that I cannot focus.

637
01:01:22,419 --> 01:01:23,560
This is not good.

638
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:26,589
I should go see my Queen first,
then focus on this later.

639
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:29,299
Next.

640
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,600
All women in the Internal Court
who are over the age of 18...

641
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,169
are permitted to wed.

642
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:42,209
Yes, Your Highness.

643
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:45,180
Also, no one under the age of 10...

644
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,379
should be accepted into the
Internal Court as a court maid.

645
01:01:49,779 --> 01:01:50,890
And...

646
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:57,160
What is next, Your Highness?

647
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,299
Your Highness?

648
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:06,430
I'm sorry, Court Lady Choi.

649
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:09,270
I see that you are having trouble focusing.

650
01:02:09,569 --> 01:02:11,939
It has only been a little while
since you last saw His Majesty.

651
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,439
It is not me. My baby misses him.

652
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,480
For the baby's wellbeing,

653
01:02:16,779 --> 01:02:20,109
would you like to go see
His Majesty for a moment?

654
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,580
I wholeheartedly agree.

655
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,520
- Your Majesty.
- Yes.

656
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,830
Her Highness is headed to
the Seonjeongjeon Hall.

657
01:02:31,759 --> 01:02:34,259
Oh, no. We just missed each other.

658
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,830
His Majesty is at the Daejojeon Hall?

659
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:40,169
Yes, Your Highness.

660
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:49,779
Wait for us, Your Highness!

661
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:52,750
Look how excited she is. My gosh.

662
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:03,220
Oh, no. Did we miss each other again?

663
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:07,359
My goodness, are we playing
hide-and-seek or what?

664
01:03:15,399 --> 01:03:16,500
This is not working.

665
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,640
In that case...

666
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,790
Finally, we meet.

667
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:35,359
After...

668
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:39,290
missing each other so many times.

669
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:44,299
Those fleeting moments felt like an eternity.

670
01:04:16,259 --> 01:04:20,299
By the way, why do you keep talking
to me so formally these days?

671
01:04:20,939 --> 01:04:23,100
Are you plotting something
to surprise me again?

672
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:55,571
MR. QUEEN

673
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:19,943
THE EPILOGUE WILL BE REVEALED
EXCLUSIVELY ON TVING.
