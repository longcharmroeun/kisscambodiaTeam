EPISODE 18

4
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:17,815
Hey.

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,716
Wait!

6
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:27,085
Go!

7
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:32,795
Stop! Hold on!

8
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:40,136
Why?

9
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:51,816
Did the King come to see
me while I was sleeping?

10
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:53,685
Yes, Your Highness.

11
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:55,716
It wasn't a dream then.

12
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:58,685
Why is he acting like this all of a sudden?

13
00:00:58,685 --> 00:00:59,956
As if he's being chased.

14
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:03,426
The uprising of the rebel
army is getting quite serious.

15
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:06,865
Even still, that seems a bit...

16
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,995
Do not worry, Your Highness.

17
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:12,135
Yes. The King will return soon.

18
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:14,266
Okay.

19
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:17,506
There must be a reason why
he's leaving in such a hurry.

20
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:21,445
He's just going to check
on them and come back soon.

21
00:01:21,745 --> 00:01:22,906
It's better for him to
finish his job quickly...

22
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,646
rather than wait for me to come
all the way down to say goodbye.

23
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,445
That's why he left without a word.

24
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,596
The owner of that seat is changing now.

25
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:45,495
You could have taken care of it at once.

26
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:48,665
It was possible because the
Queen made her decision.

27
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:52,105
The Queen?

28
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,206
She has chosen her family...

29
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:56,745
over the King for the sake of her baby.

30
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:00,245
If that is the case, I should
accept the Queen again...

31
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:04,355
for the sake of the heir to the throne.

32
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:11,026
I will ensure that you will not
have to fight for your power again.

33
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,095
You should give up.

34
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:12,405
I'd like some more of this.

35
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:16,376
Are you sure you are not eating too much?

36
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,075
Humans are an adaptive species.

37
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:21,285
It was bland and subtle,

38
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:22,645
but now I can taste the natural
flavors of the ingredients.

39
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:24,455
I don't get tired of it
no matter how much I eat.

40
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:26,116
Rather, the more I eat, the hungrier I get.

41
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:28,885
This little thing eats so much.

42
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:40,265
Fine. I'll stop eating.

43
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:42,705
I'm really fine. Why do you
keep looking at me like that?

44
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:46,775
I should go on a walk to digest.

45
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:49,176
Let me have some more of this first.

46
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:04,556
The weather is insane.

47
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:09,465
This kind of view needs to
be photographed and posted.

48
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,296
It is not too late for me...

49
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,236
to understand you.

50
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:17,876
Let us do as you said.

51
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:20,876
No touching.

52
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:24,645
You truly are my anti-fan.

53
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:29,486
I was very concerned, but I
have figured out a way now.

54
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:30,916
So don't like me.

55
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,785
But I still like you.

56
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,856
Even if you have more flaws
than anybody else in the world,

57
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,126
I still like you.

58
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:41,726
Oh, my. All the memories are coming back.

59
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,566
This won't do. This place is too dangerous.

60
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:44,595
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

61
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,465
I was almost in trouble.

62
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:52,205
The lake is is too crucial.

63
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:07,256
Then, today is our first day.

64
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:09,285
Let's form an alliance.

65
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,765
Okay.

66
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:19,135
Starting now, the no-touching
rule does not apply between us.

67
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:29,905
Darn it.

68
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:33,376
Every part of this palace
is a minefield of memories.

69
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:37,556
Why is the Palace so empty today?

70
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:40,256
Why is it so big for no reason?

71
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,951
EPISODE 18, THE COUNTERATTACK OF MEMORIES

72
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,266
Your Highness.

73
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:06,745
Your Highness, the Minister of War is here.

74
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:11,285
I went to Daejojeon Hall,
but you were not there.

75
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:16,285
Did something happen to the King?

76
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:17,756
No.

77
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:25,266
You're bleeding.

78
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,735
Did you get hurt?

79
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:32,535
It is nothing a but a small
injury that I got during training.

80
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,776
It is late, but I came to
congratulate you on your pregnancy.

81
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:39,846
Thank you.

82
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:43,346
What do you think about
making amends with the clan...

83
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,055
for the sake of your baby?

84
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:49,226
I'm pretty sure we finished
talking about that last time.

85
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,795
It does not matter if you let go of my hand.

86
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,866
However, you should not be too isolated.

87
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,325
You already know...

88
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,996
that this Palace is not an
easy place to live alone.

89
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:04,906
Thanks for your advice, but I'm not alone.

90
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,276
I'm pretty sure you know that too.

91
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,445
If you need someone to help you,

92
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,315
you can grab my hand at any time.

93
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:14,486
I will put everything on the line...

94
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:17,455
to protect you and your baby.

95
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,835
The sighs and resentment of
the people have grown recently.

96
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:37,136
It just so happens that it
has arrived at this behavior,

97
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:41,276
so I have left the royal
throne to see for myself.

98
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:45,276
The nation's affairs are
important, so while I am gone,

99
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,646
follow the decisions made
by the Grand Queen Dowager.

100
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:52,455
This is the King's command.

101
00:09:57,455 --> 00:10:01,695
In order to fill the King's spot and
handle political affairs properly,

102
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:04,195
I will change the personnel.

103
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:05,935
The former Left State Councilor,

104
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:07,435
Kim Seok Geun, will return to his post,

105
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:09,665
and the former Minister
of War, Kim Chang Hyup,

106
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:11,575
will become the Royal Guard Commander.

107
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,205
The current Royal Guard
Commander, Prince Yeongpyeong,

108
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:17,315
will focus on his duties as
the commissioner of Ijungchung.

109
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:42,435
The King has gone on a rough path.

110
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:47,075
If anyone tries to ruin the King's
reputation with strange rumors,

111
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:51,616
I guarantee that their
tongue will not be safe.

112
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:27,386
My baby.

113
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:29,746
You're really cute.

114
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:33,955
Do everything...

115
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:35,656
that you want to do.

116
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:46,535
Nothing is better than calligraphy
when you're feeling restless.

117
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,976
My baby. Do you miss your dad too?

118
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,075
Say "Daddy, please come back soon."

119
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:01,646
I think it just kicked. Did it answer me?

120
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,516
Isn't it too early to feel fetal movement?

121
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,715
It's too early.

122
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:09,085
Is he a genius?

123
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:12,325
Oh my gosh. My baby must be a genius!

124
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,726
Why am I making such a fuss?

125
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,106
Your Highness.

126
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,506
I just had a really bad feeling.

127
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,606
A bad feeling that I'll
become a fastidious parent...

128
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:32,376
who is a mix of a doting
dad an overprotective mom.

129
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,346
Your baby is very precious.

130
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:36,215
No matter how fastidious you
are, it would not be enough.

131
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:40,185
I am sure that your baby
will be just like you...

132
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,886
Why would you say something so foreboding?

133
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:44,226
But...

134
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:48,825
Why is my baby becoming like me foreboding?

135
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:51,295
It is time for you to take
your medicine, Your Highness.

136
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,476
Drink up.

137
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:02,805
Good job.

138
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,715
Her Highness said "my baby".

139
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:11,785
Good job.

140
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,996
What did they put in the medicine?

141
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,636
Is it medicine to prevent
dementia, not miscarriages?

142
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:34,346
It's like I had chongmyungtang.
I can't stop thinking.

143
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,545
I can't sleep because I'm being
hit with a whirlwind of memories.

144
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:58,065
His name is Cheoljong, so I'll stitch in CJ.

145
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:01,006
Did you really finish this in one night?

146
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,165
I wondered why people did embroidery.

147
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:05,406
When I keep my hands busy, I
don't think about anything.

148
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:06,476
It's nice.

149
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:08,846
You have amazing embroidery skills.

150
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:10,715
How beautiful.

151
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:13,075
This silk is from Jinju, Gyeongsang Province.

152
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,815
I thought wearing this as a scarf...

153
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:16,646
on a cold day like this would be perfect.

154
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:19,856
I am sure His Majesty
will be happy with that.

155
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:23,156
No, this is for me.

156
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:26,526
My body feels stiff because
I've been sitting down too long.

157
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:29,925
Do you want to play some fun games?

158
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:31,896
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

159
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,136
HEAD EUNUCH

160
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,675
I got it. The King.

161
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:45,415
Over there.

162
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:46,915
Head Eunuch?

163
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:50,116
Right. It's the King whom Head Eunuch serves.

164
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,785
The answer is Head Eunuch.

165
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,396
Is that so? I didn't see that.

166
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,096
Next.

167
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,695
TIGER

168
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:03,726
The King!

169
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:04,795
MONKEY

170
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:05,795
The King.

171
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:06,965
RABBIT

172
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:08,006
The King.

173
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:10,236
DOG

174
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,305
This is way too easy.

175
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,415
He's pitiful like an abandoned dog.

176
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:18,945
The King?

177
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:21,915
Your Highness.

178
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:25,516
Do you miss him that much?

179
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:28,785
You had a great relationship with him.

180
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,626
My gosh, that's not it. Don't overreact.

181
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:34,965
Gosh. What?

182
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:38,136
This isn't fun. Give me
back my needle and thread.

183
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:46,236
Your Highness, are you all right?

184
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:47,876
No.

185
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,146
I'm not all right.

186
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,616
It hurts so much.

187
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:57,415
How can this tiny needle hurt so much?

188
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,425
This is all because of my hormones.

189
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:04,356
Now that I'm pregnant,

190
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:06,626
I easily worry. And I have a lot on my mind.

191
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:08,425
I cry a lot as well.

192
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,596
It's not coming from me.

193
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:13,965
It's the hormones.

194
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:20,305
I feel so much pain in my heart.

195
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:27,445
My gosh. It feels like the
needle carved out my heart.

196
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,016
Your Highness.

197
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,156
Oh, no.

198
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,455
What's wrong with me?

199
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:43,626
We are still looking for the body.

200
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:45,596
Please give me some time.

201
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,035
I cannot wait.

202
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:51,406
We must hurry even more if the King is alive.

203
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,006
I will announce the fate the
King faced. Get it ready.

204
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:57,575
Yes, Your Highness.

205
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,045
I am completely geared up.

206
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:04,316
The needle can't make me cry now.

207
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:07,215
Oh my gosh!

208
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:09,656
- Your Highness.
- You startled me.

209
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,356
I almost lost my unborn child.

210
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,255
How could you say something like that?

211
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:17,165
Your Highness.

212
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,265
What is it? You're scaring me.

213
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,076
Is the King hurt?

214
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,275
His Majesty...

215
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,816
His Majesty...

216
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,316
has...

217
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,985
left this world.

218
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:59,205
What if I didn't fall asleep that night?

219
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,445
His Majesty...

220
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:07,076
has left this world.

221
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:18,425
What if I asked you to stay?

222
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:23,126
Please return to us, Your Majesty!

223
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,935
Please return to us, Your Majesty!

224
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:33,675
Please return to us, Your Majesty!

225
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:37,775
What if I never came to Joseon...

226
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:40,915
and we never met?

227
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:45,286
You would still be alive now.

228
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:48,586
5 DAYS BEFORE THE ENTHRONEMENT

229
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,185
Return here?

230
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:52,525
How can anyone ask a dead king to come back?

231
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:54,995
That is one horrifying request.

232
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,665
And we still have not found the body.

233
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:00,495
Asking him to return is making my hair rise.

234
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,235
If I could, I want to crown a new king.

235
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,235
But if I do not follow the custom...

236
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:08,146
of waiting for the late king's revival,

237
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:11,445
I am sure this will come back
and damage my political agenda.

238
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:13,475
Even if the King is alive,

239
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:15,945
he will not be able to
come back to the palace.

240
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:18,955
I will seal off the gates...

241
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:20,656
until the enthronement ends.

242
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,286
Yes.

243
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:25,455
As long as we can proceed with
the enthronement in five days,

244
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:28,165
he will not be the king anymore.

245
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:30,495
So it will not be treason
even if we have to kill him.

246
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,406
How long must I wait for
the Queen to come around?

247
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:44,646
Does she even want to
reconcile with the clan?

248
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,515
I will tell her to get herself
together and visit you...

249
00:19:47,515 --> 00:19:48,985
as soon as possible.

250
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:12,705
JOURNAL FOR PRENATAL EDUCATION

251
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:19,015
What is the point of all of this...

252
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:23,546
when you're not here?

253
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:49,975
YOU CAN BUY POWER WITH MONEY.

254
00:20:58,955 --> 00:20:59,985
My baby.

255
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:03,086
Do not be sensitive to the smell of food.

256
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:05,326
Do not make things hard on your dear mother.

257
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:09,165
You can run around all
you want during the day.

258
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:13,096
But when your dear mother
wants to sleep, stop that.

259
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,566
When you come out of this world,

260
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,836
please come out quickly,

261
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:21,106
so you do not put your mother
through a lot of trouble.

262
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:26,475
More importantly, come into
this world as a healthy baby.

263
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:33,985
I am very much looking forward
to the day when we will meet.

264
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,025
I promise to be next to you...

265
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:45,165
when you take your first
breath in this world.

266
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:49,765
Even if this world seems strange
to you, do not be afraid.

267
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:36,983
Show your respect.

268
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:40,323
Was this your plan all along?

269
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,232
His Majesty already knew of this danger.

270
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,833
But to save you,

271
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,732
he put himself in danger and left the Palace.

272
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:51,403
What are you talking about?

273
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,782
Prince Yeongpyeong shall
be imprisoned at once.

274
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:04,883
- No!
- Your Highness!

275
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:06,883
What are you doing?

276
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:11,552
Why would you take it out
on Her Highness the Queen?

277
00:23:11,552 --> 00:23:14,692
His Majesty passed away because
of the Donghak believers.

278
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:22,063
The rebel army does not even
behead county governors.

279
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:25,772
Are you saying they dared to
kill His Majesty the King?

280
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,242
Do you expect me to
believe such a blatant lie?

281
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,442
Kim Byeong In, your
soldiers killed His Majesty.

282
00:23:36,843 --> 00:23:40,183
You and the Queen led His Majesty to death,

283
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:43,482
so I shall end her life
with my own two hands.

284
00:23:47,022 --> 00:23:48,222
No, please!

285
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:49,663
Your Highness...

286
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,732
For the sake of the baby
inside Her Highness's womb,

287
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,863
please do not hurt her.

288
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,202
Her Highness knows nothing about it.

289
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:00,802
Please...

290
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,542
Please...

291
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:16,552
Gosh! Your Highness!

292
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:24,192
Lock him up.

293
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,212
Are you all right?

294
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:46,583
What was he saying?

295
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:49,482
Your soldiers hurt His Majesty?

296
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:52,452
You two, leave the room.

297
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,363
- Your Highness.
- It's okay.

298
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:12,512
When a misfortune befalls you,
you need someone to blame.

299
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:16,683
Prince Yeongpyeong is being delusional,

300
00:25:17,313 --> 00:25:19,153
so do not take it to heart.

301
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:22,782
Why are you imprisoning Prince Yeongpyeong?

302
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:25,022
I have evidence to believe
that he dismissed...

303
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,792
the Donghak believers who had sneaked into...

304
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:29,792
the Royal Guard Division and concealed it.

305
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:32,532
They seemed to be linked to the
incident involving His Majesty,

306
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,563
so I was going to investigate
Prince Yeongpyeong.

307
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:37,232
I should have acted sooner.

308
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,673
What exactly are you talking about?

309
00:25:40,202 --> 00:25:42,603
You're talking as if Prince
Yeongpyeong killed the King.

310
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:45,472
Someone inside the palace must
have given the Donghak believers...

311
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,482
information on when the King
entered and left the palace.

312
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:53,012
It must have been someone who
could access the information,

313
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:55,782
which means it was most
likely Prince Yeongpyeong.

314
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,992
Are you sure the Donghak believers
assassinated His Majesty?

315
00:26:00,252 --> 00:26:03,762
There is something more important
you should be focused on now.

316
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:08,063
Now, only the people in
our clan can protect you...

317
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:09,433
and your baby.

318
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,603
Please do not concern
yourself with useless things.

319
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:15,343
You must reconcile with the
Grand Queen Dowager at once.

320
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:17,242
If you miss this opportunity,

321
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:22,843
you may never be able to mend
your relationship with the clan.

322
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,302
Prince Yeongpyeong, I wish to
be born as you in my next life.

323
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,772
"Find evidence." It sounds very simple,

324
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:53,413
but it actually requires a lot of work...

325
00:27:01,323 --> 00:27:02,782
I see that everyone is here.

326
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,792
I do not think it is appropriate...

327
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:12,863
to gather at a kisaeng parlor
during the King's funeral.

328
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:15,002
I purposely chose this
place so we could all relax.

329
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:20,333
Now with that said, we can all be
honest while we're here at least.

330
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,343
The King's death...

331
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:27,272
should be celebrated.

332
00:27:32,512 --> 00:27:33,853
Let us drink.

333
00:27:34,183 --> 00:27:37,893
The rebel mobs are going bonkers.

334
00:27:38,153 --> 00:27:40,653
I am worried about the future of Joseon.

335
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,663
At this rate, the Donghak believers...

336
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,863
could raid Hanyang soon.

337
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,833
And if that happens, everyone here...

338
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:51,873
will be hurt.

339
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:56,603
That is why I think we
should seal off the palace...

340
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:59,843
as well as the entire
fortress walls around Hanyang.

341
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:03,442
We will declare a state of emergency
and strictly restrict entry.

342
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:06,052
Anyone who looks suspicious
shall be detained.

343
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,853
That way, we can get rid of
all the followers of Donghak.

344
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,093
That is a brilliant idea.

345
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,742
The Queen must be losing her mind.

346
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:31,813
She was never all there to begin with.

347
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:37,782
She thought she had all the
power now that she's pregnant,

348
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:41,113
but the King ended up like that.
I bet she is in shock right now.

349
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:45,252
Now, if she gives birth to a baby prince,

350
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:48,522
it'll actually get her killed.

351
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,363
Look at you saying something
useful for a change.

352
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:09,813
We have to change the
candles and incense sticks.

353
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:36,302
Your Highness, I'll die from
a heart attack at this rate.

354
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:39,512
They're guarding a dead person like this?

355
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,343
Does this look normal to you?

356
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:47,353
We must hurry.

357
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:51,653
Thanks for doing that.

358
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:11,343
The body is greatly damaged.

359
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:14,173
Especially his face.

360
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,813
He is so badly hurt that
he is hardly recognizable.

361
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:44,073
Eureka!

362
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:57,452
You rats, I did not do anything wrong.

363
00:30:57,452 --> 00:30:59,823
Those who rightfully deserve to be
locked up always raise their voices.

364
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:02,623
You are guilty of misplacing
dozens of firearms.

365
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:06,663
How dare you falsely accuse me
of something so dishonorable?

366
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:09,532
What kind of idiot misplaces
firearms of all things?

367
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:12,232
I see that idiot right here.

368
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:14,972
The firearm storage has been robbed.

369
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,573
I suppose you are not even curious...

370
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,542
about what Prince Yeongpyeong is guilty of.

371
00:31:23,913 --> 00:31:26,913
Do not worry. You won't be here for long.

372
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,052
What?

373
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:33,222
What does that mean? Then...

374
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:34,863
will we be executed?

375
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:38,133
I'm totally fine with
staying here for a long time.

376
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,133
I love sleeping on the floor...

377
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:40,462
Hey, you!

378
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:47,702
That's right.

379
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:51,972
Let's talk it out. I know we can do it.

380
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,452
Kim Byeong In tried to send
Cheoljong to the rebel army...

381
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:04,353
using me as bait to kill him.

382
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,823
But this is someone else's
corpse, which means...

383
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,623
things didn't go according to his plan.

384
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:16,962
So he's locking up Cheoljong's
men who can help him return.

385
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:27,472
I can't focus because you
two keep sobbing like that.

386
00:32:33,653 --> 00:32:35,183
Come closer.

387
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:41,222
I'll let you in on a secret.

388
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:45,133
But the two of you must take it to the grave.

389
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,462
The King...

390
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,002
is alive.

391
00:32:56,873 --> 00:32:58,913
Yes, of course.

392
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:04,282
His Majesty will be alive
in your heart forever.

393
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:06,552
Your...

394
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:09,922
I touched the body from head to toe.

395
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,222
But it's not him.

396
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:14,393
From head to toe?

397
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:17,693
I will not elaborate on it.

398
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:23,063
- My gosh.
- If he is alive,

399
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:26,233
how come he has not returned yet?

400
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:29,572
He is either hurt or tied up somewhere.

401
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,472
- Court Lady Choi.
- Yes.

402
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,983
Is there a law that prevents anyone
from ascending to the throne...

403
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:37,083
as soon as the late king has passed away?

404
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:40,282
Yes. There's a custom called sangwibok.

405
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:44,152
We must wait for the late king's
spirit to return for five days.

406
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:46,592
And the next king can only ascend
to the throne after five days.

407
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:49,793
Then, we have six days including
the day of enthronement.

408
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:53,233
They'll try everything in their playbook...

409
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,302
to make sure he never comes
back in those six days.

410
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,572
How many court maids do
we have at the Palace?

411
00:33:59,032 --> 00:34:03,443
There are about 230 court maids.

412
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,472
And if I were to include court servants,

413
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:07,512
there must be over 600 girls.

414
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,742
600 living surveillance cameras.

415
00:34:11,512 --> 00:34:13,853
If all of them say 1 word,
there will be 600 words.

416
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:17,083
Let's use these court maids.

417
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:19,092
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

418
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,152
I should ruin the enthronement ceremony.

419
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:24,563
Are we on the same team?

420
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,063
Let's do this.

421
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:28,862
- Yes.
- Yes.

422
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,933
Yes.

423
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:34,103
If His Majesty is alive...

424
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:40,072
As our empire faces many hardships,

425
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:42,483
installing a new king cannot be postponed.

426
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:45,652
As for the new king who will
continue to serve with royal duties,

427
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:48,253
I crown the 32nd descendant...

428
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,822
of Prince Minheung, Yi Gyeong Won, as King.

429
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:54,492
And the King had left this world...

430
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:56,963
due to the uprising by the rebels...

431
00:34:57,393 --> 00:34:58,862
"These heinous Donghak
believers who have stolen..."

432
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:01,163
"the King from us will not be shown mercy."

433
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,532
"I declare that every single one..."

434
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:06,333
"of Donghak believers will be annihilated."

435
00:35:07,402 --> 00:35:09,443
The Donghak believers got
themselves in trouble.

436
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,802
Those rascals.

437
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:21,382
Byeong In.

438
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:28,963
Why did you lock up...

439
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:30,262
Prince Yeongpyeong and Special Director Hong?

440
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,733
Depending on who sits on the royal throne,

441
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,262
the power dynamic changes.

442
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:36,003
This is not the first time that has happened.

443
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,402
Even so. It has not been
long since the King's death.

444
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,302
How can you lock up innocent people?

445
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:42,342
"Innocent"?

446
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:46,172
Siding with a weaker side is a crime too.

447
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:50,083
Byeong In, how far will you take this?

448
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,552
I plan to take on more power.

449
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,282
To protect what is dear to my heart,

450
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,853
I need more power.

451
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,103
Make my lips look lifeless.

452
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:11,603
You already look like a living corpse.

453
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:14,572
Then, make me look like a real corpse.

454
00:36:19,273 --> 00:36:21,043
Must you go this far?

455
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,943
I'm the only one the King has now.

456
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:29,382
Even if they want to get rid of me,

457
00:36:29,382 --> 00:36:31,683
they won't lock up a pregnant woman.

458
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,722
How do I look?

459
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:41,762
- You look like a real corpse.
- Really?

460
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:04,222
The Grand Queen Dowager is here.

461
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:37,552
These two are definitely bringing
their A-game to their show.

462
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:44,693
But I'll take the Grand Award tonight.

463
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:50,433
Your Majesty.

464
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,443
How can you leave me here?

465
00:37:57,672 --> 00:38:00,612
What about our child?

466
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:03,143
Your...

467
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:08,012
Your Majesty.

468
00:38:12,552 --> 00:38:15,322
- Your Highness.
- Your Majesty.

469
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:16,862
Your Highness.

470
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:19,663
Your Majesty.

471
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:23,063
Call the royal physician now. Call him now!

472
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,233
- Your Majesty.
- Your Highness.

473
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,172
If I stay here a second
longer, I might curse at them.

474
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:31,242
Move, move.

475
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,873
- Your Majesty!
- Your Highness.

476
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:38,552
- Your Highness.
- Your Majesty.

477
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,422
My goodness.

478
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:48,722
Oh, no. Goodness.

479
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:51,492
My goodness.

480
00:38:51,822 --> 00:38:56,103
Oh, no. Goodness.

481
00:38:59,373 --> 00:39:00,572
Did you call for me?

482
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:04,172
I know you must have been
shocked to hear the news.

483
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,572
What happened to him over the past few days?

484
00:39:08,782 --> 00:39:11,382
How could he pass away so suddenly like this?

485
00:39:13,713 --> 00:39:14,813
The King...

486
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:19,722
is alive.

487
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,023
I called you to tell you that.

488
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,333
Thank you.

489
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,402
Thank you so much.

490
00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:39,373
So listen.

491
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,313
This is just getting started.

492
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:43,842
Okay.

493
00:39:47,782 --> 00:39:51,623
In four days, we will be
able to stabilize our empire.

494
00:39:52,753 --> 00:39:55,492
Thanks to the King, we got
rid of the Donghak believers.

495
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,793
And the rest of the lowlifes
will try to protect themselves.

496
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:01,762
Given how this is unfolding,
we can say that...

497
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:03,833
he sacrificed his life to save the empire.

498
00:40:09,103 --> 00:40:10,572
Before that happens,

499
00:40:12,572 --> 00:40:15,213
I had a small concern,

500
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,382
so I asked for your attendance here.

501
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:22,623
The Andong Kim clan and
the Pungyang Jo clan...

502
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:24,452
have been enemies for a long time.

503
00:40:25,152 --> 00:40:27,753
To oppose a common enemy, the King,

504
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:29,693
we have joined hands for the time being.

505
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:31,862
But now that the King is out of the picture,

506
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,233
I am afraid that the two clans
will start attacking each other...

507
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:36,003
and compete against each other.

508
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,233
So...

509
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,202
before we proceed with a new agenda,

510
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:43,972
I have prepared something to strengthen...

511
00:40:43,972 --> 00:40:45,643
the alliance between the two clans.

512
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:57,583
"A rebellion in the court..."

513
00:41:01,552 --> 00:41:02,822
Restoration and dethronement?

514
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:04,222
RESTORING OR DETHRONING A KING

515
00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:05,222
That means...

516
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,092
you are plotting treason.

517
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,233
That is something deep in all of your hearts.

518
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,902
The King is dead anyway.

519
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:17,202
Why would we leave this kind of document?

520
00:41:17,202 --> 00:41:19,612
It is to make sure that we
all share responsibility.

521
00:41:20,342 --> 00:41:24,083
It will prevent either clan to
breach the terms of our alliance.

522
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,713
I am leaving evidence to show
that we are in the same boat.

523
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,753
As long as you agree to this,

524
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:33,922
I guarantee that the two
clans will be able to...

525
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,963
coexist in a balanced power dynamic.

526
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:38,793
This means that...

527
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,532
you want to have control of our lives.

528
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:51,103
We cannot agree to something like that.

529
00:41:57,012 --> 00:41:59,052
What are you doing?

530
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:00,813
How dare you mobilize the soldiers?

531
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,483
You must agree to my term...

532
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:08,052
to make it out alive of this room.

533
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:17,532
KIM BYEONG IN

534
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:40,722
Your Highness.

535
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:43,762
Yes. Come in.

536
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:52,572
- Your Highness.
- Did you find out anything?

537
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:55,773
Like you said, the gates of the Palace...

538
00:42:56,972 --> 00:43:00,143
and all the gates around
Hanyang have been closed.

539
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:02,242
I knew it.

540
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:04,313
What about the soldiers?

541
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:05,583
There is a place...

542
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,353
where the soldiers are stationed
and continuing to search.

543
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,822
It is near a cliff.

544
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:13,753
I found you, Cheoljong. I will save you.

545
00:43:18,322 --> 00:43:20,992
I'm getting sleepy. The
two of you should go too.

546
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:26,503
Gosh, I'm so sleepy.

547
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:31,342
I'm so sleepy.

548
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,572
Have a safe night, Your Highness.

549
00:43:33,972 --> 00:43:35,742
Sweet dreams, Your Highness.

550
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,342
Okay. Good night to you both.

551
00:43:38,543 --> 00:43:39,652
Yes, Your Highness.

552
00:43:43,382 --> 00:43:44,722
Be healthy.

553
00:43:46,492 --> 00:43:47,652
Pardon?

554
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:51,393
You shouldn't be careless
when it comes to your health.

555
00:43:53,733 --> 00:43:54,992
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

556
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:29,003
Where is the Queen?

557
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:31,103
She had fainted due to the shock,

558
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,273
but she recovered quickly.

559
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:33,702
She fainted?

560
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,373
Where are you going?

561
00:44:54,523 --> 00:44:58,023
This is not what I think, is it?

562
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,663
Are you really going to take this far?

563
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,202
- Don't mind me.
- You cannot go.

564
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:09,202
If you leave the Palace,
you will be in danger.

565
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,702
Do you think that I'm unaware of that?

566
00:45:11,202 --> 00:45:12,413
I know everything.

567
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:14,713
I know you used me as
bait to corner the King,

568
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,083
and that you were the one who
pointed a sword at the King.

569
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:19,452
I know everything.

570
00:45:19,652 --> 00:45:21,882
As long as you are safe,

571
00:45:21,882 --> 00:45:23,853
I am okay with you hating me.

572
00:45:24,152 --> 00:45:26,052
So resent me all you want.

573
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:27,992
And give up.

574
00:45:28,422 --> 00:45:30,262
The King is dead anyway.

575
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:32,793
No. He's not dead.

576
00:45:33,793 --> 00:45:36,302
You know that the King is
not one to die so easily.

577
00:45:36,663 --> 00:45:39,072
Isn't that why you closed the Palace
gates and rushed the enthronement?

578
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:40,172
Your Highness.

579
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:42,373
Please.

580
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:46,512
You must turn your back on
the King so that you can live.

581
00:45:49,683 --> 00:45:51,512
You asked why I chose the King, right?

582
00:45:52,612 --> 00:45:54,583
I'll give you my answer now.

583
00:45:55,183 --> 00:45:57,253
If someone has to become a king,

584
00:45:57,623 --> 00:45:59,523
I think His Majesty is the
best person for the job.

585
00:46:00,322 --> 00:46:02,492
He is the most suitable person to be a king.

586
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:06,862
So don't try to stop me
from giving my vote to him.

587
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:07,992
If you continue to stop me,

588
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:16,202
I have no choice either.

589
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:20,943
How could you point an arrow at me, So Yong?

590
00:46:21,172 --> 00:46:22,643
You know how I feel.

591
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:26,112
If you loved her so much,

592
00:46:26,813 --> 00:46:28,882
shouldn't you have figured out...

593
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:30,722
the changes that occurred to Kim So Yong?

594
00:46:33,393 --> 00:46:34,422
Look at me.

595
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:37,693
Am I really the woman you
longed for all this time?

596
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:40,233
I'm a completely different person
inside, but you had no idea.

597
00:46:40,762 --> 00:46:42,063
The person you loved...

598
00:46:43,202 --> 00:46:44,833
is nothing but a shell.

599
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:46,802
- So Yong.
- The real Kim So Yong you loved...

600
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:48,172
is no longer here.

601
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:51,443
What on earth are you saying?

602
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:59,253
The real Kim So Yong wouldn't have
been able to shoot an arrow at you.

603
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:01,983
Because at the very least, she
cared for you as a brother.

604
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:04,422
But I'm different.

605
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:09,123
I can shoot you as much as I want.

606
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:22,103
I warned you!

607
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:25,373
I didn't think I'd really hit him.

608
00:48:05,952 --> 00:48:06,983
What are you two doing?

609
00:48:08,353 --> 00:48:10,922
You made it so obvious, so we
thought you wanted us to come too.

610
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,523
I came so that I could live.

611
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:17,063
If you are not in front of me, I
feel like I might die from anxiety.

612
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,433
Forget it. Go back.

613
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:22,902
No, Your Highness.

614
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:25,362
If you must go alone, step on me as you go.

615
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:36,512
There are only four days left.

616
00:48:38,943 --> 00:48:40,683
The enthronement is in four days.

617
00:48:40,683 --> 00:48:42,952
How will you search the entire forest...

618
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:45,052
and find the King by yourself?

619
00:48:47,922 --> 00:48:49,163
Did you just laugh at me?

620
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,592
Yes, Your Highness.

621
00:48:51,023 --> 00:48:52,933
There are so many wild
beasts in the mountains.

622
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,632
You will not be able to
endure it by yourself.

623
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:56,603
You will end up a meal for dholes...

624
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:59,972
Or the soldiers may find you
after you have frozen to death.

625
00:49:00,702 --> 00:49:04,472
Oh, my. I'm so scared. I'm shaking.

626
00:49:04,472 --> 00:49:06,012
Say whatever you want. It won't scare me.

627
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:08,213
Let us go back.

628
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,583
Since Her Highness does not
want us to come with her,

629
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:13,483
we will be punished for
failing to stop the Queen...

630
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:16,523
and be forced to drink a bowl of poison...

631
00:49:17,282 --> 00:49:19,853
and fall into an eternal sleep.

632
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,302
Okay, fine. You can come with me.

633
00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:41,373
It's not like I'm going on a vacation.

634
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:42,413
Why do you want to follow me?

635
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:45,083
How will you pass the fortress of Hanyang?

636
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:49,222
I was planning to jump over the
walls with my incredible skills,

637
00:49:49,222 --> 00:49:51,152
but I can't now since I
have two people with me.

638
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:55,592
The fortress of Hanyang is really
high, so how can you jump over it?

639
00:49:57,193 --> 00:49:58,523
Why do you keep laughing at me?

640
00:50:00,362 --> 00:50:03,433
We have prepared everything,
so do not worry, Your Highness.

641
00:50:16,856 --> 00:50:18,086
Your Highness.

642
00:50:27,379 --> 00:50:28,910
I thought we were having drinks to celebrate,

643
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,510
but your face looks like you are
having drinks as you were defeated.

644
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,519
How can your injury heal like this?

645
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:35,479
Where did you get hurt?

646
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,490
If you try to take away my glass again,

647
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:43,490
I will cut off your hand.

648
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,430
If you loved her so much,

649
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:52,669
shouldn't you have figured out...

650
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:54,740
the changes that occurred to Kim So Yong?

651
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:58,269
Last night, he looked exactly like you.

652
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,379
What? Love?

653
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:05,709
Why would you say something so disgusting?

654
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,550
I'm already confused about my identity.

655
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:08,919
Why would you talk about love now?

656
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,110
You are late.

657
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:36,349
Go to your room and get some rest.

658
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:39,149
The furnace has been lit, so it will be warm.

659
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,220
Why are you not asking me any questions?

660
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,789
That is what a father is like.

661
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,930
What has been made?

662
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,700
A letter plotting treason.

663
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:02,870
Without even consulting me?
That is extremely risky.

664
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,910
Once we get our hands on it, it
will become a weapon we can use,

665
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:06,240
so please do not be concerned.

666
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,439
I will bring it to you.

667
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,050
But you were accused of treason.

668
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,410
If you return as soon as the King is gone...

669
00:52:13,879 --> 00:52:15,249
It will look suspicious.

670
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,590
I do not need a position in the Royal Court.

671
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:20,019
I will be happy...

672
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,289
if I can continue to quietly
assist you behind the scenes.

673
00:52:27,629 --> 00:52:31,129
By the way, I heard the Queen
left the palace at night.

674
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,399
How dare a queen run away
in the middle of the night?

675
00:52:35,669 --> 00:52:37,610
I haven't told anyone as it
is a disgrace to the family,

676
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,309
but you already know about it.

677
00:52:39,479 --> 00:52:42,240
Knowing the Queen's personality,

678
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:44,910
I do not think she simply ran away.

679
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,820
Then what?

680
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:51,519
I bet she wants to find the King to
return everything back to its place.

681
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:56,689
She must be convinced that the King is alive.

682
00:52:57,629 --> 00:53:01,300
And she has a reason to
believe that he is alive?

683
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,070
She voluntarily took off the
queen's gown and left the palace,

684
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,300
so she is...

685
00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:09,039
nothing more than an ordinary woman now.

686
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,209
Even though I knew that she was lying,

687
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:14,110
I tried to accept her because
Byeong In tried so hard.

688
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:17,979
The King and the Queen seem
to love each other dearly,

689
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:22,349
so we shall bury them together
in the middle of nowhere.

690
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,519
Will you take care of it?

691
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:39,599
My lord.

692
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,870
I have returned to assist
the Grand Queen Dowager.

693
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:48,110
Are these the people who
took the King's life?

694
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,809
Yes.

695
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,680
We are mere herb gatherers.

696
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:54,349
We have never even met His Majesty.

697
00:53:55,249 --> 00:53:58,349
Then I shall say that you lowborn vermin...

698
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,019
caught the dragon without even realizing it.

699
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,590
You got up right away,
which means you're fine.

700
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:31,550
I thought you were dead.

701
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,059
Who are you?

702
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:35,590
What do you think? A
herb gatherer, obviously.

703
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,660
Why else would I be in the woods?

704
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:40,999
Did you save my life?

705
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,329
Not exactly. Let's just say I
found you and brought you here.

706
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:47,240
You were wearing expensive clothes,

707
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,169
so I figured you'd give me something...

708
00:54:49,169 --> 00:54:51,010
in return for saving your life.

709
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,439
Nothing's free in life, you know?

710
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,379
But you don't have anything
that's worth money.

711
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,110
The fabric did look expensive,

712
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,820
but I couldn't sell it
because it was all torn.

713
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,490
So I burned everything.

714
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:05,789
Did you burn everything?

715
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:09,490
I keep seeing soldiers
searching through the woods.

716
00:55:11,459 --> 00:55:13,930
Did I get myself in trouble
by bringing you here?

717
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,470
Hey!

718
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,269
If you run away without paying
me for treating your wounds,

719
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:22,099
I will chop your hands off using this.

720
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,840
Don't you forget that.

721
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,419
I only brought you the nicest ones.

722
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,470
So? Please continue, Your Highness.

723
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,180
So they're using a fake
corpse to hold the funeral.

724
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,740
If they manage to hold out for
six days and enthrone a new king,

725
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:04,579
it's game over.

726
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,120
How did you figure that out?

727
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,349
Evil jerks are always predictable.

728
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,849
Those jerks... They deserve to be punished!

729
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,599
So this is the confession
written by a Donghak believer.

730
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,510
I already have someone we can pin this on,

731
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,709
so find the right time to announce it...

732
00:56:32,709 --> 00:56:34,010
after the enthronement.

733
00:56:36,249 --> 00:56:37,249
Father.

734
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,919
May I ask you to oversee the guards
at the palace for the time being?

735
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:44,890
Why?

736
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:47,419
I wish...

737
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:51,959
to bring the heads of the
King and the Queen myself.

738
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:02,269
3 DAYS TO THE ENTHRONEMENT

739
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:05,340
Byeong In!

740
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,050
You are heading out to
look for the Queen, right?

741
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:13,280
Why did she leave the palace?

742
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,149
You must know the reason.
You two are very close.

743
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,519
The Queen is no longer the
So Yong I used to know.

744
00:57:21,419 --> 00:57:22,419
What?

745
00:57:41,209 --> 00:57:43,649
I must go bring His Majesty back.

746
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:47,220
What a sloppy-looking lock.
Maybe I can unlock this.

747
00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:56,160
There's got to be a secondary lock somewhere.

748
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,789
I'm surprised you unlocked that thing.

749
00:57:57,789 --> 00:57:58,959
Special Director Hong.

750
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:06,169
Prince Yeongpyeong, are you all right?

751
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,809
What brings you here?

752
00:58:10,209 --> 00:58:12,539
I'm friends with everyone
inside the palace, you know.

753
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:16,709
You got locked up just because
you're the King's close friends.

754
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,879
Don't worry about anything.

755
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:21,879
I will get you out no matter what.

756
00:58:21,879 --> 00:58:23,349
Gosh, you...

757
00:58:24,249 --> 00:58:27,660
Your loyalty remains unchanged
even in this turbulent situation.

758
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:29,590
Of course.

759
00:58:30,229 --> 00:58:33,059
You didn't befriend me because I'm
a member of the Andong Kim clan.

760
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:36,999
And I didn't befriend you because
you're the King's close friend.

761
00:58:38,899 --> 00:58:40,240
- Right.
- The thing is though,

762
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,499
it's utter chaos right now, whether
it's in or outside the palace.

763
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,610
They want to wipe out the Donghak
believers for killing the King.

764
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:48,680
I'm afraid they'd hurt innocent people.

765
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:50,510
Also,

766
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:54,349
even the Queen disappeared overnight.

767
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,760
What do you mean the Queen disappeared?

768
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,490
She sneaked out of the palace...

769
00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:05,360
with her court lady and court maid.

770
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,399
Byeong In just left the palace...

771
00:59:08,399 --> 00:59:10,669
to look for her,

772
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,999
but the impression I got
from him concerns me.

773
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:15,240
Why are you concerned?

774
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,410
Maybe it's just in my head,

775
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,340
but he looked as though...

776
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:22,240
he wanted to hurt her.

777
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:30,620
My gosh.

778
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:36,289
What? Why?

779
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,430
What is it?

780
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:44,599
Now, we're good.

781
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:46,970
Let us go.

782
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,570
What was that about, Court
Lady Choi? You scared me.

783
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,740
You have to be careful at all times.

784
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:56,180
Good point.

785
00:59:57,649 --> 01:00:00,079
You're always so careful. I give you that.

786
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:02,519
Go. Keep going.

787
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,450
Here, let me help you.

788
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:07,760
Gosh, please be careful.

789
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:11,459
My gosh, I can't believe
you brought these things!

790
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:12,860
What's this?

791
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,030
Candied bellflower roots.

792
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,599
Candied bellflower roots?

793
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:19,939
I got it from someone special,
so I've been treasuring it.

794
01:00:20,499 --> 01:00:21,870
You can have it, Your Highness.

795
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,709
- Then I'll try one.
- Sure.

796
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:28,939
My gosh, it's so good! Here, try one.

797
01:00:28,939 --> 01:00:30,110
Hong Yeon, you too?

798
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,309
- All right.
- Here, you try one too.

799
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:33,320
Thank you.

800
01:00:34,349 --> 01:00:35,479
It's so good.

801
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,090
Court Lady Choi! My gosh.

802
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,459
- I am fine.
- Are you all right?

803
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,729
Yes, I'm okay.

804
01:00:49,499 --> 01:00:51,570
Oh, boy. I am totally fine, Your Highness.

805
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:53,129
- Let's keep going.
- Okay!

806
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,539
Where is His Majesty?

807
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,840
Your Highness, you were
raised like a precious flower.

808
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,749
Are you really okay with sleeping here?

809
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:06,919
Yes, I've done this many times.

810
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,519
Really? You have?

811
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,519
Even I have never done this before.

812
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:13,919
Come on. This is nothing.

813
01:01:13,919 --> 01:01:16,019
Have you walked 400km carrying
military gear that weighs 50kg?

814
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:17,789
400km?

815
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,329
Look at you bluffing. 400km? Come on.

816
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:27,439
Fine, I exaggerated it a little.

817
01:01:27,439 --> 01:01:28,740
But I've definitely walked 200km.

818
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,110
During our cold-weather operations,
we melted ice and drank...

819
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:35,610
Sure, sure. We believe you.

820
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:39,209
Hey! I'm dead serious.

821
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:41,519
Of course, Your Highness.

822
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:43,249
I don't want you to catch a cold.

823
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:46,919
We can't even start a bonfire
because we don't want to be caught.

824
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:49,959
I'm worried about how we'll
sleep through this cold night.

825
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,789
We're sorry you have to go
through this, Your Highness.

826
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:55,300
Come on. It's not cold at all.

827
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:57,470
This is nothing compared to
those cold-weather operations.

828
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,399
Your Highness.

829
01:02:28,499 --> 01:02:30,370
Turn off the AC, will you?

830
01:02:31,399 --> 01:02:33,769
I might catch a cold.

831
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:33,660
We have not found her.

832
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:36,499
Split into teams and comb
through the mountain.

833
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:37,729
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

834
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:03,090
For some reason, I'm getting
a good feeling today.

835
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:07,599
This sunny weather makes me feel
like we'll find His Majesty today.

836
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:20,939
- We have no time for this. Hurry.
- Right, okay.

837
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,240
- Let us hurry.
- We should hurry.

838
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:26,919
- Is it this way?
- Yes, Your Highness. Keep going...

839
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:32,349
We are almost there.

840
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:34,760
We'll arrive at the cliff shortly.

841
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,689
You sure are in your 20s.

842
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,530
You're full of energy!

843
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:43,530
- Let's take a quick break.
- Yes, Your Highness.

844
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,939
I have to say, the world
looks like a brighter place...

845
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,450
now that we are out of
the palace, Your Highness.

846
01:05:01,749 --> 01:05:04,120
You used to hate leaving the palace.

847
01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:05,289
My gosh.

848
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:08,059
What about you, Hong Yeon?

849
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,990
What's your preference?
In or outside the palace?

850
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,530
Wherever you are, Your Highness.

851
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:15,530
- My goodness.
- Hey, cut it out.

852
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,070
Your Highness, they're here.

853
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,169
There they are. Get them!

854
01:05:25,169 --> 01:05:26,510
Run! We must get out of here.

855
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:27,709
- Okay.
- Run!

856
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:32,510
Hong Yeon, escort Her Highness. Go!

857
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:35,280
Court Lady Choi, what are
you doing? Court Lady Choi!

858
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:38,720
Don't you dare, you jerks! I won't let you!

859
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,120
Your Highness, we must get out of here.

860
01:05:40,459 --> 01:05:42,620
- Court Lady Choi!
- I won't let you!

861
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:43,789
Let go!

862
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,530
Your Highness...

863
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:50,570
No!

864
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:53,370
Back off!

865
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:08,249
- Court Lady Choi!
- Your Highness!

866
01:06:08,749 --> 01:06:09,849
No, please...

867
01:06:11,849 --> 01:06:12,849
Chase them!

868
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:14,590
Please stop.

869
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,960
No! Please don't.

870
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,200
- Court Lady Choi!
- Your Highness! Please...

871
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:26,500
- Court Lady Choi!
- No. No!

872
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:32,339
- No! Court Lady Choi!
- We must go, Your Highness!

873
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:33,880
Court Lady Choi!

874
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,349
Your Highness!

875
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:41,920
Run! Please run, Your Highness!

876
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:54,729
Your Highness, I hope you find His Majesty.

877
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,339
Hong Yeon!

878
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:02,339
Over there!

879
01:08:24,219 --> 01:08:25,519
Who are you?

880
01:08:27,259 --> 01:08:30,089
What on earth have you done to So Yong?

881
01:08:45,639 --> 01:08:49,910
MR. QUEEN

882
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:12,299
<i>You said you knew everything
about me and So Yong.</i>

883
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,000
<i>I could suddenly read...</i>

884
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:16,299
<i>all her memories.</i>

885
01:09:20,509 --> 01:09:23,309
<i>So Yong is still alive inside
you if such memories are intact.</i>

886
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:26,009
<i>Join hands with me, just until
