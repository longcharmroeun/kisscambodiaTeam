00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:08,330
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,612
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

3
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,940
If you don't want to talk about it,

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,811
why don't we come up with
our own hand signals?

5
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:16,810
Like this one.

6
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:18,981
What is that?

7
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:22,250
This means whatever I'm saying is a lie.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,680
What do you think? It's not that hard.

9
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:33,021
A king never lies.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,930
EPISODE 15

11
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:00,120
What kind of sin could
such a young child commit?

12
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,461
I smell liquor and something else.

13
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:06,691
She didn't drink poison.

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,631
I cannot believe she was forced to
drink poison with such small hands.

15
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:17,971
Her hands are warm. She's still alive.

16
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,381
Please get up.

17
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,450
Dam Hyang!

18
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:34,521
Your Highness.

19
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,801
- Sir.
- You are here.

20
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:51,900
Sir.

21
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,071
Here you go.

22
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,150
We must not leave such a
young child in the mountains.

23
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,650
I would only feel comfortable
if I held a funeral for her.

24
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:16,860
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

25
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:39,181
How's Dam Hyang. Is she okay?

26
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,890
She should have left the
Palace safely by now.

27
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,821
I pardoned her mother, who
was a government slave,

28
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,730
and made the preparations so she
could leave Hanyang with her.

29
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,131
She's meeting her mom.

30
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,061
She was so worried about her as
she only had four fingernails.

31
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,931
Thank goodness. This is great.

32
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,740
How did you do it? Did
you use a sleeping pill?

33
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,341
I had her drink mafeisan.

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,080
Mafeisan is what the noted doctor
Hua Tuo used for surgeries, right?

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,351
You have heard of him.

36
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:11,020
Of course. I've read "Three
Kingdoms for Kids" so many times.

37
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,321
"Three Kingdoms for Kids"?

38
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:18,420
You. You should've told me
about your plan beforehand.

39
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,230
It was an urgent situation,

40
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,230
and it was dangerous for many people to know.

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,270
Did you hear from Special Director Hong?

42
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:33,040
Yes. He made sure that
the child escaped safely.

43
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,341
Good job.

44
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:40,580
It was reckless to put
yourself in such danger...

45
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,381
over a court maid.

46
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,321
She was not just a court maid.

47
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:46,920
If I gave up on this child,

48
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,390
it would become easier to give up on...

49
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,490
10, 100, and then all of my people.

50
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:59,101
I thought Cheoljong was just a fool,

51
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,471
but he was an incredibly stupid fool.

52
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:04,971
Don't spend too much time
thinking about great things.

53
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:06,170
You won't live long.

54
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,371
My goal is not to live an embarrassing life.

55
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,411
Those are perfect values
to have an early death.

56
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:13,510
This is all your...

57
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,980
This is how she is thanking me.

58
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,921
The language that the Queen
uses is different from others.

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,421
That "Queen Dictionary" is useless.

60
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,520
It's filled with liberal and mistranslations.

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,660
- Did you see it?
- You left it open, so I could see.

62
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:32,260
But was the position of
queen always this dangerous?

63
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,131
Why is everyone so determined to kill me?

64
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,600
I will prevent this from
happening ever again.

65
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:40,871
No. I will take care of it my way.

66
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,741
The best defense is a good offense.

67
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,051
As of today, I'm the
crazy one in this palace.

68
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,770
EPISODE 15, THE CRAZY X IN THIS PLACE

69
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,770
Did you try to get rid of the Queen?

70
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,441
The Queen is on the King's side.

71
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:22,350
She gave our family's embarrassments
and weaknesses to the King.

72
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:25,381
She has fallen for the King and
turned her back on her family.

73
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,520
That is not true.

74
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,090
I am sure you do not want to believe...

75
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,260
that the Queen, whom you adore so much,

76
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,061
is nothing but a foolish woman...

77
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:36,830
who flounders about after falling for a man.

78
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,801
After I came into this family,

79
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:42,671
I did whatever you wanted
so that you would accept me.

80
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,910
It was not just so that I
could remain in this household.

81
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:49,111
I wanted to become like you...

82
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,881
and respect you.

83
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,481
However, the moment you
tried to hurt the Queen,

84
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,291
you are no longer my father.

85
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,220
If anyone tries to harm the Queen,

86
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,200
I will be sure to slit their throats.

87
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,001
You can come back home whenever you want.

88
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,441
Even if you do not consider
me to be your father,

89
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,981
you will always be my son.

90
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:42,160
Who would've hidden the
ledger in Daejojeon Hall?

91
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,731
The prime suspects...

92
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:46,760
are the two people who have a
grudge against me for no reason.

93
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,270
Queen Dowager Jo and Jo Hwa Jin.

94
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,171
If you consider motive,
the culprit is Jo Hwa Jin.

95
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,950
Considering how she acted during the
hunting game on Surit-nal, I'm sure.

96
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,850
However, Jo Hwa Jin didn't come
near Daejojeon Hall recently.

97
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:10,791
If you consider movement, Queen
Dowager Jo is the culprit.

98
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:13,520
Here.

99
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,361
It's suspicious how she comes
here so often these days.

100
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:21,400
Of course, Queen Dowager
Jo also has a clear motive.

101
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:23,801
Is it the Queen Dowager?

102
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:25,801
That little raccoon.

103
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:31,640
Then how did the Queen Dowager
get her hands on the ledger?

104
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:37,681
That's the mystery.

105
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,590
But more than that, what
kind of ledger is it?

106
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,910
I did not have an exorcism today.

107
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,350
I apologize for my rude behavior previously.

108
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,381
I am sure you would not bow
your head for no reason.

109
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,890
What is the reason?

110
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,660
As I had expected,

111
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:21,960
you are quick to read the situation.

112
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,370
Thank you for joining me in
this uncomfortable gathering.

113
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,740
I am sure you came to
realize from today's events,

114
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,511
It is the time for the nobility to live,

115
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,311
not our families.

116
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,521
We are intimately interdependent.

117
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:46,750
LITERALLY SAYS "WITHOUT LIPS, TEETH
ARE COLD" AND MEANS THEY'RE CLOSE.

118
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,891
If 1 of the 2 family ends up in ruins,

119
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,321
the other family will have
a hard time staying afloat.

120
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:59,100
That is why I would like to
suggest a decree of amnesty...

121
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,500
as a promise of harmony
between our two families.

122
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,870
GRANTING AMNESTY FOR CERTAIN
CRIMINALS FOR THEIR CRIMES

123
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,071
A decree of amnesty?

124
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,301
Many wasted talents lost
their government posts...

125
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:09,340
due to a momentary mistake
in both of our families.

126
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,441
That is why we should make a decree
of amnesty to pardon those people.

127
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:17,521
In other words, it is a
symbol of our promise,

128
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:19,051
and a congratulatory gift.

129
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:20,691
What do you think?

130
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:24,161
Would you like to join me in this goal?

131
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:56,220
The Ministry of War tried to play
dirty tricks to fulfill his greed,

132
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,261
and I am also guilty for
being unable to subdue him.

133
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,590
As a result, I, Kim Jwa Geun,

134
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:07,531
request to step down from my
post as Training Commander.

135
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:16,441
Things will not be over for me.

136
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,840
As long as I am breathing.

137
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:41,130
Eat slowly.

138
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,041
Do you have enough side dishes?

139
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,250
If I had any sense of shame,
I would not be able to eat.

140
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,291
Why on earth did you run away?

141
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:08,230
I believe I treated you well until now.

142
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,301
The thing is...

143
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,370
Mother?

144
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:25,181
Mother.

145
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,710
Goodness.

146
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,151
You have been through so much, Dam Hyang.

147
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,750
You have been through so much, Dam Hyang.

148
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,500
It is okay.

149
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:50,301
It will all be okay.

150
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:01,080
We must try to smile around her.

151
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,580
Her Highness must not...

152
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,321
stay sad for a long time.

153
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,021
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:26,641
Your Highness. It is time for you to wake up.

155
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:36,750
Your Highness.

156
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,191
Were you unable to get any sleep last night?

157
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:45,161
I am worried that you may
put a strain on your body.

158
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,590
I have a lot on my mind, so
I couldn't get any sleep.

159
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,271
By the way, they probably
slept just fine, right?

160
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:57,541
Who?

161
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,740
The people who tried to mess me up.

162
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,641
That will be the last night
they sleep without trouble.

163
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,610
I hope they had a good night's sleep.

164
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,411
- Court Lady Choi.
- Yes.

165
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,080
Send someone to my father...

166
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,980
and ask him to come to the palace now.

167
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,350
Yes, Your Highness.

168
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,830
Your Highness.

169
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,000
Your father is here.

170
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,970
Already?

171
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:40,110
I was just about to request
your attendance at the palace.

172
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,980
But you were already on your way.

173
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,080
Yes.

174
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,720
It seems to me I made the
right decision to come.

175
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,191
- The other day...
- The other day...

176
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,431
You can go first.

177
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:59,330
No. You can go first.

178
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,771
No. You can go first, Father.

179
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:08,710
- I am sorry about the other day.
- I am sorry about the other day.

180
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,641
- No. I should apologize first.
- No. I must apologize first.

181
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,011
- I should.
- No, I should.

182
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:13,281
- Gosh.
- I should.

183
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:25,261
Gosh. Blood is thicker than water.

184
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:27,960
Right.

185
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:33,600
Well, I asked to see you here today...

186
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,230
because of the ledger.

187
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:42,240
- Did you know about this?
- Everyone is going crazy over it.

188
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,441
What is the ledger for?

189
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:52,651
The ledger has records of our
clan's illegal activities.

190
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:55,220
A weakness of the Andong Kim clan.

191
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:58,161
That's why Cheoljong wanted
to get his hands on that.

192
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:02,261
I actually came here today, so
I could talk about the ledger.

193
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:06,230
After you and the King stayed at
my house, the ledger disappeared.

194
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,230
So I have been suspecting
the King all this time.

195
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:11,470
But a while ago,

196
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:14,511
a trusted and cherished
slave of mine ran away.

197
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,080
Luckily, I caught him and
asked why he ran away.

198
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,911
The day before the ledger went missing,

199
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,781
he let in Royal Noble Consort Eui.

200
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,590
When things were chaotic at home,

201
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:30,791
he thought he must have caused
trouble and ran away. So...

202
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:34,391
I am sorry, Your Highness.

203
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,801
It is not your fault.

204
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:42,870
Now,

205
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:46,271
I have completed the puzzle.

206
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,141
Pardon?

207
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,980
Sunwon was the architect
behind my assassination.

208
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:55,480
I have specially prepared...

209
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,980
ice which is more precious than gold today.

210
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,950
The Queen Dowager indirectly bullied me.

211
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,021
I will serve you my food some time...

212
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,521
I must eat it now.

213
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,171
And Jo Hwa Jin is the one
who provided the ammunition.

214
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,171
You should come clean to the King.

215
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:17,401
You are threatening me.

216
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,200
I heard you...

217
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:22,671
loud and clear.

218
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,620
Father, I have someplace to be right now.

219
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,561
Where?

220
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,090
To open the door to the fiery pit.

221
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,700
I'll make you regret for messing with me.

222
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,171
She used to be as docile as a sika deer.

223
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,340
She has become ferocious over
a short period of time here.

224
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,080
I know that parents cannot be
impartial to their children.

225
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,651
But a sika deer?

226
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,420
If I were to compare her to an animal,

227
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,251
she would be a wild horse.

228
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:12,120
My daughter is a wild horse?

229
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:34,251
The tattoo of the Maori people.

230
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:37,180
The feather from a peacock.

231
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:39,850
And the devil wearing Prada.

232
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:42,650
Strength is beauty.

233
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,090
Today, I'll be wearing
the most beautiful armor.

234
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,430
What do you think?

235
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,430
Good.

236
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,930
Revenge is sweet when served with fireworks.

237
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,531
What is this?

238
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,130
What you see is not everything.

239
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:40,880
To find out what is inside,

240
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,180
I must cut it in half.

241
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,521
I thought it was just a
potato like it seemed.

242
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:49,221
You completely deceived me.

243
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:52,021
One should not throw away trust
and cut it without a good reason.

244
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:55,330
One should make sure what
it is before cutting it.

245
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,561
Because once it is done,
one cannot take it back.

246
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:04,170
I will serve the drinks now.

247
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,120
I prepared brunch today...

248
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:28,430
because I wanted to return
the favor for preparing...

249
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,531
such a lovely brunch the other day.

250
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:35,071
The cool drink from the last
brunch was truly amazing...

251
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:38,870
that I would not have noticed
anything even if someone was dead.

252
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,051
Please try it.

253
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:55,221
I am not thirsty.

254
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:57,821
I put a lot of effort into it.
Please at least have a sip.

255
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,461
I said I did not want to.

256
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,991
I went through an ordeal to prepare for that.

257
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,830
If you do not want to drink it...

258
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:28,150
Ice is better when you bite it.

259
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,860
A while back, I told you that...

260
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,330
I'd help you to stay healthy and
young for the rest of your life.

261
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:40,501
And I will continue to do that.

262
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,100
If you start suspecting food, drinks
and anything that goes on your body,

263
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,870
life will be nothing but misery.

264
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,840
Now that the regency had ended,

265
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,811
you must think you can do whatever you want.

266
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:52,511
Do you think...

267
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:54,680
you can still be the Queen without your clan?

268
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,211
Your Highness.

269
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,251
I don't rely on my clan or my husband.

270
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:02,551
I'm doing whatever I want
because I know what I can.

271
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,860
Oh, right. Head Eunuch.

272
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,301
Yes, Your Majesty.

273
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:18,741
I have been neglecting my duty...

274
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,701
to produce an heir.

275
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,680
How could I be so neglectful
of my duty as the King?

276
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,580
So go and report to her now.

277
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,350
Report to her?

278
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,021
I do not understand, Your Majesty.

279
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,261
You know you always report to her.

280
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:46,561
How dare you?

281
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,170
You have given me no
choice but to punish you!

282
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,801
Your Majesty, I am sorry.

283
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,640
- Punish me with death.
- What is wrong?

284
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:59,281
I was not speaking to you.

285
00:22:06,981 --> 00:22:09,650
You hold the power of my life now.

286
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:12,090
I do not want that.

287
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,491
What will I do with that?

288
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,231
Please punish me with death, Your Majesty.

289
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:20,031
My goodness. I do not
wish to have such power.

290
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,301
Head Eunuch, I know that you have no choice.

291
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:28,340
You must follow your orders.

292
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,811
I would rather have you get angry at me.

293
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:41,620
This is scarier.

294
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:48,330
How can you be a spy when
you are scared so easily?

295
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,430
I have somewhere to go
before the royal conference.

296
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:56,100
Go to Injeongjeon Hall.

297
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,640
My goodness, can you read it somewhere else?

298
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,571
Head Eunuch is in shock right now.

299
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,961
I hope you had a peaceful night.

300
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,130
Is that how you greet your elder?

301
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,001
The hairpieces are heavy.

302
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,011
So I cannot bow my head.

303
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,840
This is a sacred place where
ancestral rites are performed.

304
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,580
It is not polite to wear
such extravagant garments.

305
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,251
You have to preen yourself
before asking for a refund.

306
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,590
Oh, I'm so forgetful.

307
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,291
I forgot to offer incense to the late King.

308
00:23:56,731 --> 00:24:00,001
I can't believe I disgraced
Chunghak-dong School of Etiquette.

309
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,600
Stop it.

310
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,071
I'm extremely faithful to Confucianism.

311
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:12,011
I can't stand not performing the ritual.

312
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,180
I told you to not touch it.

313
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,951
You left something in my room.

314
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:22,920
You came unannounced and invaded my privacy.

315
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:27,690
In the end, it was that.

316
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:30,330
What are you doing?

317
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:33,330
I told you. A refund.

318
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,201
I should return the nonsense
I had to go through.

319
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:39,801
What kind of rudeness is this?

320
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,340
Slandering your elder carelessly...

321
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,471
and complaining so hard.

322
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,741
You have always been like that,

323
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:49,580
but your attitude is
even more insolent today.

324
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,751
Is it because you grew up without a mother?

325
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:57,291
You mother-in-law.

326
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:00,821
If I'm rude because I
grew up without a mother,

327
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,531
are you rude because you
lived without your child?

328
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,001
It's hot.

329
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,471
I'm so mad that I can't stand how hot it is.

330
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,840
The portrait of your precious son...

331
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,781
almost burnt.

332
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:22,410
You lost your mind.

333
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,850
Yes, I lost it big time.

334
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:29,551
I think I'm the best among all
the girls who lost their minds.

335
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,061
So watch out.

336
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:43,031
If you touch even a strand of my hair,

337
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:48,840
you will never see your son's face again.

338
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:22,119
It is not the Queen I
should have worried about.

339
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,319
It was other people.

340
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,859
"The best defense is a good offense."

341
00:26:51,748 --> 00:26:55,718
Oh, my. I didn't see you were here.

342
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:59,488
I can't believe how weak your presence is.

343
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:03,458
I'm trying to skip a stone.
Would you like to join me?

344
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,758
Do it by yourself.

345
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:08,399
The ledger.

346
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:11,299
You took it.

347
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:15,738
Thanks to the ledger, I almost died.

348
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:20,538
Tell me.

349
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,879
Is that what you wanted?

350
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:27,678
Did you really not kill O Wol?

351
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:32,218
No matter what I say, you
believe what you want to believe.

352
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:34,049
I have to take the King away from you,

353
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:36,218
kill O Wol and put her in the well.

354
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:38,329
Because it will make me a bad
girl who deserves to die...

355
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:41,389
and make you a kind and poor victim.

356
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,399
This is why victim playing is scary.

357
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,139
Because you're slowly turning
into a monster every day,

358
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,069
without even realizing it.

359
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:11,889
Look at the mirror.

360
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,288
And see how ugly you are.

361
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,319
Hold it yourself to come up.

362
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:39,619
I don't feel like being too kind right now.

363
00:28:58,508 --> 00:29:00,639
When I fell into the lake in front of you,

364
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,139
you perhaps...

365
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,448
could hold me.

366
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:15,059
This proves...

367
00:29:16,258 --> 00:29:18,889
that I'm a better person than you.

368
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,609
Kim Jwa Geun, the former Training Commander,

369
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,109
resigned.

370
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:41,379
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,849
The impeachment process was delayed,

372
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,248
so you all could have taken
responsibility for that.

373
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,188
It is a pity.

374
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:53,129
Oh, it was slip of the tongue.

375
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:55,329
I wanted to say it is fortunate.

376
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:01,169
The next agenda is...

377
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,569
Today, there is something I want
to declare to you before that.

378
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:09,678
I will make an office to remove the
indictment of the Three Tax System.

379
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:13,109
Its name is Samjung Ijungchung.

380
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:16,619
Samjung Ijungchung?

381
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:20,349
It will establish legislation...

382
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:22,389
and develop detailed plans to
solve the fundamental issues...

383
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:24,788
to remedy the problems
of the Three Tax System.

384
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,859
Joseon depends on agriculture.

385
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:32,629
The country can prosper only
when its farmers prosper.

386
00:30:32,768 --> 00:30:35,839
Government officials'
exploitation against farmers...

387
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,768
is an act to threaten the
foundation of the country,

388
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,708
hence it will be punished as high treason.

389
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,508
A careful examination is
required to make a new office.

390
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:48,518
You should hear our opinions first before...

391
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:52,089
I accept no compromise to do the right thing.

392
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,488
It means your opinions...

393
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,958
do not matter any longer.

394
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:07,998
Also, I will give the late King Sunjong...

395
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:12,609
the posthumous name of Sunjo
according to the rules.

396
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:22,379
The King is more aggressive than usual today.

397
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,258
Your Majesty.

398
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,028
There is a new appointment today.

399
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:35,958
Chief Royal Secretary also
makes a slip of the tongue.

400
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,428
It should be an appointment proposal.

401
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:42,299
The position of Minister
of War is vacant now.

402
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,508
A weak military equates
to a crisis of the empire.

403
00:31:46,508 --> 00:31:48,809
Therefore, I urge you to
appoint the Minister of War...

404
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:51,478
through the Border Defense Council now.

405
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,579
Come in Minister of War.

406
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,609
Kim Byeong In, the Minister
of War, wishes to...

407
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:23,609
offer his greetings.

408
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:41,129
Kim Byeong In can be a threat
as he has the Jo clan's support.

409
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,599
Both clans...

410
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,829
have petitioned for amnesties because...

411
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:47,629
That must be his doing as well.

412
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,839
I doubt we can ignore this many appeals.

413
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:56,579
This might give the upper class
an excuse for an uprising.

414
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,549
Now that you have full control,

415
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,319
you can do whatever you want.

416
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,218
But it is still hard to stop
them from going against you.

417
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:07,119
The best defense is a good offense.

418
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,018
Now, it is a matter of...

419
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:11,888
hitting the target faster than our opponent.

420
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,199
We do not have time to recruit more people.

421
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,259
I want you to oversee Ijungchung.

422
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,629
Special Director Hong, I will
officially dispatch you...

423
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:22,098
to visit the three cities in the South...

424
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:24,569
as people are distressed there
and launch an investigation.

425
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:27,609
Another business trip?

426
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,808
Do this for me.

427
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:38,018
The more time passes by, you
two stay here and give orders.

428
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,848
I feel like I am doing all the
heavy lifting by myself. Am I wrong?

429
00:33:40,848 --> 00:33:43,359
No, you are not alone. I always...

430
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:47,288
Once you are done with this investigation,

431
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,799
- I could give you a few days off.
- I will get ready for my trip.

432
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:53,328
"I could."

433
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,268
I said I could.

434
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:57,569
I doubt that he heard that.

435
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:59,408
That fool.

436
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,779
Your Majesty.

437
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,018
You have a letter, Your Majesty.

438
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:13,188
I will not harm you. Come closer.

439
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,629
The Queen has sent a letter to Your Majesty.

440
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,638
Are you sick?

441
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:34,708
You are so fragile.

442
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:43,219
Revenge is something else.
I thought I would be elated.

443
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:50,558
It was exhilarating.

444
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:52,458
What a thrill.

445
00:34:59,868 --> 00:35:01,029
His Majesty is...

446
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:09,808
You're here.

447
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:18,649
You seem especially more beautiful today.

448
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:20,788
That suits you well.

449
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:22,819
Everything looks good with a pretty face.

450
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:24,589
So anything looks good on me.

451
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:28,328
Who knew I would make a great queen?

452
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,969
I can never get used to that.

453
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,998
I asked to see you,

454
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:40,239
so we can form an alliance.

455
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:44,279
My clan probably left me,
thinking I am on your side.

456
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,208
So I've got nothing to lose.

457
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:48,408
If you are on my side,

458
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,848
your clan will become your enemy.

459
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,589
The clan ditched me first.

460
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,748
So I'll ditch my clan now.

461
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,888
If we have the same enemy,
doesn't that make us allies?

462
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:08,868
Yes.

463
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,469
Starting now, the no-touching
rule does not apply between us.

464
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,078
Sure. No more no-touching rule.

465
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:22,549
In martial arts movies,

466
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:24,848
I saw they drip their blood in
a cup and drink it together.

467
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,888
But I can't do something
like that as it's unsanitary.

468
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:30,819
Let's drink tea and celebrate our alliance.

469
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:31,958
It will be nice and simple.

470
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,029
What...

471
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:46,138
Is this what allies do?

472
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,038
Yes. This is how it's done.

473
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:50,408
- Bottoms up.
- What...

474
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:00,388
Now that we're allies, let's clear the air.

475
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,589
Why did you try to kill me?

476
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,388
Right.

477
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,958
It is a topic we must discuss at some point.

478
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,768
We thought you heard our conversation...

479
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,498
about assassinating your father.

480
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,669
He is still your father-in-law.

481
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,669
To me, he was one of the corrupted officials.

482
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:23,308
You are so harsh.

483
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:26,009
I get it. You even tried
to kill your own wife.

484
00:37:26,308 --> 00:37:27,748
You're a serial killer of the Kims.

485
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:29,879
I am sorry.

486
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:32,819
I know that my apology
does not mean much now,

487
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,058
but there were many
misunderstandings and situations.

488
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:38,158
Okay.

489
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:40,589
Then, you owe me one.

490
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:42,299
I won't forgive you until
you pay me back somehow.

491
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:45,899
So what are you trying to achieve?

492
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:47,368
Strengthening the sovereign authority?

493
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:51,638
That is only a tool to fix our broken empire.

494
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:55,408
I do not think the root
of the world can change.

495
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:58,538
So to be honest, I like your
tool, rather than your goal.

496
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:00,779
If the sovereign authority is
strengthened, I'll be strong too.

497
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:03,149
Then, no one can come after me.

498
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,248
I am well aware of the fear
that comes from a death threat.

499
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,018
I know you are acting tough,
but you must be scared.

500
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:13,688
I'm not sure.

501
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,058
Is it because I died once?

502
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:17,859
I hate being trampled on more than dying.

503
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:22,199
If I can chew out all those
people trying to trample on me,

504
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:25,509
I will die with a smile.

505
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:29,179
Your Highness.

506
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:32,109
It is time to prepare lunch.

507
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,348
Okay. On that note,

508
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:37,348
I'll go do that.

509
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:56,399
I will die with a smile.

510
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,868
"Die with a smile".

511
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:18,419
- Lord Kim.
- Hey. Byeong In.

512
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:21,828
I mean, Minister of War.

513
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:25,359
- Are you teasing me?
- Gosh, no.

514
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:27,529
Please call me by my name.

515
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:30,098
Actually, I was waiting for you...

516
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,408
because I wanted to talk
about the Queen with you.

517
00:39:35,638 --> 00:39:39,879
As it so happens, I had something
to tell you about her as well.

518
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,828
Where did I put it?

519
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:56,859
Where did I put it?

520
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,199
- Hold on.
- I saw it.

521
00:40:07,669 --> 00:40:08,669
You!

522
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:12,748
How dare you use the knife? You
have not been here long enough.

523
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,078
Things are different now.

524
00:40:17,078 --> 00:40:21,649
Chef these days never want to
drink some makgeolli after work.

525
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:24,018
They always say no. My goodness.

526
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:26,828
I said it would be my treat.
I do not know why they say no.

527
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:27,828
Goodness.

528
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,868
I do not understand the
court maids these days.

529
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:37,899
I told them to come late,
and they really came late.

530
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:40,739
They should have been there
before their scheduled time.

531
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,179
- Kids these days.
- Kids these days.

532
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,978
This is for Tongmyeongjeon Hall.

533
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:56,618
Darn it.

534
00:40:57,658 --> 00:40:59,688
I had one more revenge left.

535
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:01,589
A recipe for revenge?

536
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:08,069
I should do exactly what he did to me, right?

537
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:10,469
A tooth for a tooth. An eye for an eye.

538
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,408
A loss of manhood for a loss of manhood.

539
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:16,208
Then, brackens?

540
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,578
- Adlay?
- Brackens and adlay.

541
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:21,879
This recipe has a lot of healthy ingredients.

542
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,279
It will take forever to
achieve my goal with food.

543
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:26,188
That's too long of a plan.

544
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:29,719
Let's go big.

545
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:33,989
- Castration.
- Castration?

546
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,629
I have never heard...

547
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:41,498
Oh, I see.

548
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,438
It is such a precious ingredient.

549
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:49,839
I am not here to burden you.

550
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:53,248
I am a man who knows when to give up.

551
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,149
I apologize.

552
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,348
You do not need to.

553
00:41:58,379 --> 00:42:02,118
May I ask you a question for the last time?

554
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:04,759
- Yes.
- Why do you...

555
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:07,859
dislike a man who has ambition?

556
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:14,529
While living in the Palace, I
have seen many ambitious people...

557
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:17,899
and their difficult ends.

558
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:19,969
I do not like...

559
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,339
and am afraid of such things.

560
00:42:25,138 --> 00:42:26,748
Thank you for answering my question.

561
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:40,228
If I could dare expect something from you,

562
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:43,629
it is that your bright smile...

563
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,129
will remain forever.

564
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:47,929
Oh, it is you.

565
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:53,609
It must be over.

566
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:55,879
Your intuition is as sharp as a sickle.

567
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,478
You are so quick-witted.

568
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:00,679
How could I not know when
you are crying like this?

569
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,478
Do not look at me.

570
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:09,419
I do not want anyone to see me like this.

571
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:12,989
Then go over there and cry on your own.

572
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,429
People might think that I made you cry.

573
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:17,558
It was not me.

574
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:22,368
I will not cry anymore.

575
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:26,768
Being able to end my feelings
cleanly is a part of love.

576
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:31,179
It may be harder than continuing to love her.

577
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,578
You have become quite the poet.

578
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:36,949
Let us go. Stop crying.

579
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,029
She insisted on sending me a meal?

580
00:43:54,169 --> 00:43:55,899
What is with this ominous drawing?

581
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:59,509
Goodness, it is so pretty.

582
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,739
Court Lady Chun. You would survive
even after consuming poison...

583
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:04,509
because you are so slow-witted.

584
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:08,279
Why are you complimenting me all of a sudden?

585
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,899
Your Highness.

586
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:34,908
I, Shim Ong of the Han
clan, am here to say hello.

587
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:41,779
Have we not met before?

588
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:47,888
I am much obliged.

589
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,518
No, I mean... Please forgive me.

590
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:55,158
I believe you should be
saying something else to me.

591
00:44:55,489 --> 00:44:56,699
For example,

592
00:44:57,899 --> 00:44:59,929
"Punish me with death, Your Highness".

593
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,569
I lost all the popcorn I worked
so hard to make because of you.

594
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,009
I lost it all because it went flying.

595
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,609
I had no idea you were the Queen,

596
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:16,578
and I committed such a huge crime.

597
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,248
You had no idea it was me?

598
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,489
Then why did you run away?

599
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:25,589
That is because...

600
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,328
such a noble person was running after me,

601
00:45:28,328 --> 00:45:30,058
so I was surprised.

602
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:33,728
I did not have any other reasons.

603
00:45:33,828 --> 00:45:34,929
Is that so?

604
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:41,538
To be honest, I called you here...

605
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:46,708
to give you a government post.

606
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,719
It is a good position. You don't
need to worry about getting fired,

607
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:52,788
and the pay is good too.

608
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,989
Of course, you end up losing something else.

609
00:45:57,018 --> 00:45:58,089
Pardon?

610
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,288
Did you just say I would lose something?

611
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,868
When I saw you, despite
it being a brief meeting,

612
00:46:06,098 --> 00:46:07,899
your physiognomy is
perfect for this position.

613
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:09,438
I am much obliged, Your Highness.

614
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,208
You...

615
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:16,779
should become my eunuch.

616
00:46:16,978 --> 00:46:18,078
What?

617
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,549
Hold on. Wait a second.

618
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:23,819
Let go of me, you eunuchs.

619
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,719
Your Highness.

620
00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:28,748
I beg your kindness.

621
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:30,489
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

622
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:32,658
Why are you doing this to me?

623
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:35,089
First,

624
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:37,658
you bought a fake family register
and pretended to be a noble.

625
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:40,268
No. This isn't your fault.

626
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:42,868
The social structure that
divides classes is to blame.

627
00:46:43,038 --> 00:46:44,469
That is correct.

628
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:46,908
Let's go again. First,

629
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:48,969
you put poisonous herbs in the
water of the Royal Kitchen...

630
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:51,078
and ruined the King's banquet.

631
00:46:52,538 --> 00:46:53,679
Second,

632
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:55,748
your descendant is a bad person.

633
00:46:57,078 --> 00:46:58,078
"My descendant"?

634
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:01,618
Are you sure you did not
mix it up with my ancestors?

635
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:03,558
No.

636
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:05,759
I'm certain.

637
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:11,299
Your descendant is a bad person.

638
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,029
My descendant?

639
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:15,498
Your Highness.

640
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,469
If I become a eunuch, I will
not have any descendants.

641
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:19,938
If I become a eunuch, I will not
have any descendants. Your Highness!

642
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:23,239
I will not have any descendants.

643
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,339
Hey, do you have any
descendants? You do not, right?

644
00:47:25,438 --> 00:47:28,049
I will not be able to have any descendants!

645
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:31,379
My gosh. Your Highness!

646
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:40,529
Your Highness, the Ministry of War is here.

647
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:51,969
Your Highness,

648
00:47:52,638 --> 00:47:54,069
The Andong Kim clan.

649
00:47:54,368 --> 00:47:56,279
I'm certain they're all in cahoots.

650
00:47:56,978 --> 00:47:59,109
But my father is also a
part of the Andong Kim clan.

651
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:02,478
What? I just naturally
called him "my father".

652
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,819
The transfer of emotions is serious.

653
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:13,129
I figured out what had happened
to you after I met you yesterday.

654
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:16,129
I had no idea you went
through such a big ordeal.

655
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:18,158
You had no idea...

656
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:20,098
that they tried to kill me?

657
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:23,199
I am not on my father's side,
nor am I a part of the Kim clan.

658
00:48:24,098 --> 00:48:26,638
However, you aren't free from either of them.

659
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:30,339
You will find out eventually.

660
00:48:42,688 --> 00:48:44,558
Is he an enemy or an ally?

661
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:57,699
How dare he do that to So Yong?

662
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:06,149
Even still, how could
he do that to the Queen?

663
00:49:09,419 --> 00:49:11,018
Kim Jwa Geun, that jerk.

664
00:49:11,919 --> 00:49:13,319
I ought to...

665
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,228
Furthermore, it's Samjung Ijungchung.

666
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,998
They're using the corruption
of the leaders as an excuse...

667
00:49:28,998 --> 00:49:31,699
to try to bring down our family.

668
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:33,038
Do not worry.

669
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:36,239
If they try to find a problem with
it by calling it exploitation,

670
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:38,078
then nobody is innocent.

671
00:49:39,078 --> 00:49:41,449
In order to protect themselves,

672
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,949
they will all try to protect the leaders,

673
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:47,819
so all that will be left of
Samjung Ijungchung is its shell.

674
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:53,158
Even if you join them temporarily,

675
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:55,989
do not even blink in
front of Queen Dowager Jo.

676
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,859
She may smile in front of you,

677
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,969
but she is always ready
to stab you in the back.

678
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,368
I will keep that in mind.

679
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:05,498
Court Lady Chun.

680
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,109
Yes, Your Highness.

681
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,339
Clear the table and call in Nurse Park.

682
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:13,208
Yes, Your Highness.

683
00:50:17,049 --> 00:50:18,518
Are you already done eating?

684
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,248
I don't have much of an appetite.

685
00:50:22,149 --> 00:50:24,089
I heard that you were quite satisfied...

686
00:50:24,089 --> 00:50:25,859
with the meals that the
Queen prepared for you.

687
00:50:27,129 --> 00:50:28,888
It was not that great.

688
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:31,129
It was just edible.

689
00:50:31,558 --> 00:50:33,969
The Queen is very heartbroken.

690
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:38,299
She said that Royal Noble
Consort Eui came between you,

691
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:41,308
and she was mistaken to believe that
our family turned our backs on her.

692
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,478
She is blaming herself.

693
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,049
Royal Noble Consort Eui?

694
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:49,109
I heard it from the Queen's father today.

695
00:50:49,478 --> 00:50:51,819
The person that deceived
you was not the Queen.

696
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,288
It was Royal Noble Consort Eui.

697
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:06,058
The King is here.

698
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:09,029
Tell him to come in.

699
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:17,478
Your Majesty.

700
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,408
I apologize for coming at such
a late hour without any notice.

701
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:22,509
It is okay.

702
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:25,419
It is an honor regardless of when you come.

703
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,949
I came to tell you something.

704
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:32,388
What is it?

705
00:51:33,129 --> 00:51:36,498
It is about the body of the court
made found in the well recently.

706
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:40,768
The Queen Dowager hired someone to do that.

707
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,438
Queen Dowager did it?

708
00:51:44,899 --> 00:51:46,169
Why would she...

709
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:48,208
Can you not think of the reason either?

710
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,308
If so, the body is...

711
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:54,848
It must not be O Wol's.

712
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:58,149
It is impossible. It was definitely O Wol.

713
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,989
I heard it was difficult to identify
due to the condition of the body.

714
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:03,018
Why were you sure that it was O Wol?

715
00:52:03,558 --> 00:52:05,719
She was wearing a garment for court maid,

716
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:09,489
and O Wol was the only court
maid who had disappeared.

717
00:52:12,759 --> 00:52:15,368
She knew that you would think she is O Wol.

718
00:52:16,438 --> 00:52:18,138
What the Queen Dowager wants...

719
00:52:19,098 --> 00:52:21,268
is you relying on her.

720
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,379
But why did it have to be the well of all?

721
00:52:26,308 --> 00:52:28,748
I told her what I had
gone through in the well.

722
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:33,518
The well is a place where I met you.

723
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,319
But it is also a place that hurt me.

724
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:38,688
It reminded me of you,

725
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,989
so I was sure I lost the person I cherished.

726
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:45,958
Now I realize I cannot carelessly
reveal my wound to others...

727
00:52:47,169 --> 00:52:48,429
in the palace.

728
00:53:06,848 --> 00:53:10,989
Drag the Queen down to the
nightmare I am living in.

729
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:20,169
You should never trust the
Queen Dowager from now on.

730
00:53:20,828 --> 00:53:22,169
We should hide that we know it,

731
00:53:23,138 --> 00:53:25,739
so do not let her know
that you know what she did.

732
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:31,179
I am also deeply disappointed
and feel betrayed by her.

733
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:34,078
The well is a place...

734
00:53:35,308 --> 00:53:37,478
that instills fear in me.

735
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,649
I cannot believe she used it.

736
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:57,498
It's similar to poker and hwatu.

737
00:53:57,739 --> 00:53:59,938
Gabbling and gaming...

738
00:53:59,938 --> 00:54:02,868
are surely the best ways to
waste your time and life.

739
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:05,279
I am glad to hear that.

740
00:54:05,638 --> 00:54:08,379
We were worried you might have a
hard time because of Dam Hyang.

741
00:54:10,578 --> 00:54:11,819
Please forgive me.

742
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:15,489
Don't worry. Dam Hyang went to a good place.

743
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,719
Right? She must have gone
to a good place, right?

744
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:20,929
Dam Hyang.

745
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:27,569
I mean... A really good place.

746
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:28,629
Yes, Your Highness.

747
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:31,638
Dam Hyang...

748
00:54:34,009 --> 00:54:36,069
I said she really went to a good place.

749
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:39,748
Why are you crying?

750
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,908
My apologies.

751
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:45,149
Come to think of it,

752
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:49,219
I couldn't even say farewell to her.

753
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:52,859
Dam Hyang.

754
00:54:57,129 --> 00:54:59,259
- Dam Hyang.
- Your Highness.

755
00:55:00,728 --> 00:55:01,998
Dam Hyang.

756
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:03,569
Seven.

757
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:06,739
Eight.

758
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:08,669
This is...

759
00:55:09,908 --> 00:55:11,808
called nine.

760
00:55:16,109 --> 00:55:18,078
Please forgive me.

761
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,018
Darn it.

762
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,118
- Dam Hyang.
- Dam Hyang.

763
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:27,658
All in.

764
00:55:31,854 --> 00:55:34,794
How did Queen Dowager get the ledger?

765
00:55:34,894 --> 00:55:37,595
The ledger we tried so
hard to find but failed.

766
00:55:38,925 --> 00:55:42,695
At this point, would it not be
the right choice to recruit her?

767
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:45,535
It is a joke.

768
00:55:46,235 --> 00:55:49,405
Hearing she is better than me who
can freely roam outside the palace,

769
00:55:49,405 --> 00:55:50,675
I am disappointed in myself.

770
00:55:51,805 --> 00:55:54,175
Queen Dowager mostly
stays at Seonwonjeon Hall.

771
00:55:54,175 --> 00:55:56,474
I cannot understand how she got the ledger.

772
00:55:56,814 --> 00:55:58,544
The fact that she faked the corpse...

773
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:01,754
means she has people working for her.

774
00:56:01,754 --> 00:56:04,184
Should we recruit them then?

775
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:07,495
Is the composite of the one with
a goblin mask not available yet?

776
00:56:08,024 --> 00:56:10,865
I have been too busy with work these days.

777
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:13,224
Freeing Dam Hyang's mother from slavery...

778
00:56:13,224 --> 00:56:15,164
and finding her missing father.

779
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:16,934
You could not find her
father though, did you?

780
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:19,305
How can I find a person who
is hiding in the mountains?

781
00:56:19,604 --> 00:56:21,305
He must have become a bandit.

782
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:28,715
Thinking about the holiday...

783
00:56:28,715 --> 00:56:30,584
after the business trip
as a royal investigator,

784
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:35,314
I am barely enduring it these days.

785
00:56:36,515 --> 00:56:38,925
Hey, what I meant was the holiday...

786
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,465
Can you appoint me...

787
00:56:44,465 --> 00:56:46,095
as a secret inspector,
not a royal investigator.

788
00:56:46,095 --> 00:56:47,664
That is cooler.

789
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:50,564
After hiding my identity, I will
show them the tablet, like this!

790
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:55,104
You are a born secret
inspector. Do it as you want.

791
00:56:56,235 --> 00:56:57,305
One more time.

792
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:27,704
I didn't think Great Lord
Yeongeun was that kind of person.

793
00:57:28,104 --> 00:57:30,204
Kim Jwa Geun is the one who deserves to die.

794
00:57:30,204 --> 00:57:31,305
Great Lord Yeongeun is...

795
00:57:33,874 --> 00:57:35,814
my only family.

796
00:57:47,995 --> 00:57:50,925
Hey, are you sleeping after trying to kill...

797
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,164
your father-in-law and wife?

798
00:57:54,365 --> 00:57:55,495
Oh, you're not.

799
00:58:12,245 --> 00:58:14,354
Calm down, my heart.

800
00:58:14,985 --> 00:58:16,825
It hurts my pride.

801
00:59:20,555 --> 00:59:22,885
She was in the water for a long time.

802
00:59:24,254 --> 00:59:27,254
How suffocating and
painful must it have been?

803
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:32,695
Finding her body in the well is
either an awful coincidence...

804
00:59:33,064 --> 00:59:35,294
or someone is trying to come between us.

805
00:59:52,285 --> 00:59:53,854
I was too deep in my thoughts.

806
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,684
You must have been deeply shocked.

807
00:59:55,985 --> 00:59:57,885
The palace is too big for me.

808
00:59:59,024 --> 01:00:02,655
Not only it makes you lonely,
but it also makes you lost.

809
01:00:02,995 --> 01:00:05,925
I found the court maid who sold
the norigae you had given to O Wol.

810
01:00:06,495 --> 01:00:08,894
She said she only found the
norigae buried at the palace.

811
01:00:10,704 --> 01:00:11,965
Is that so?

812
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:13,604
She is the very court maid who
put the dead body in the well...

813
01:00:13,604 --> 01:00:15,934
by Queen Dowager's order.

814
01:00:16,675 --> 01:00:18,104
O Wol is alive.

815
01:00:18,604 --> 01:00:20,474
She was attacked in the palace.

816
01:00:21,345 --> 01:00:23,684
She could not even step
foot outside the palace.

817
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:27,414
Do you not have to wish...

818
01:00:27,954 --> 01:00:30,084
the dead body found in the well is not O Wol?

819
01:00:31,354 --> 01:00:33,425
Do you not have to be happy...

820
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:35,095
that there is a possibility that
it is not O Wol's dead body?

821
01:00:35,954 --> 01:00:38,425
Why do you believe that the corpse is O Wol?

822
01:00:38,664 --> 01:00:39,794
What on earth...

823
01:00:42,695 --> 01:00:44,735
What on earth are you hiding?

824
01:00:49,235 --> 01:00:50,274
Last time,

825
01:00:52,675 --> 01:00:55,314
what did you hand over...

826
01:00:57,084 --> 01:00:58,414
to the Queen Dowager?

827
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:10,564
Did you see it?

828
01:01:11,294 --> 01:01:12,365
I...

829
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:17,805
can see nothing without your permission.

830
01:01:22,575 --> 01:01:24,504
Anyone can be lost sometimes.

831
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:26,945
You still have a chance to get back on track.

832
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,414
What if I am not lost just for a moment?

833
01:01:33,785 --> 01:01:34,914
Can I still...

834
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:38,325
get back on track?

835
01:01:41,754 --> 01:01:43,325
I cannot go back.

836
01:01:43,695 --> 01:01:44,925
Your Highness.

837
01:01:44,925 --> 01:01:47,664
The dead body has to be O Wol.

838
01:01:57,805 --> 01:02:00,144
Why are you making samhyang ramyeon...

839
01:02:00,845 --> 01:02:02,345
in the middle of the night?

840
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:08,584
Why do you crave ramyeon especially at night?

841
01:02:08,584 --> 01:02:11,124
You know it will make your
face puffy the next morning.

842
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:14,925
Yet it's so hard to fight the temptation.

843
01:02:17,495 --> 01:02:20,095
You worked hard but it is a
shame that there is not a chance.

844
01:02:20,095 --> 01:02:22,164
Grand Queen Dowager does not eat...

845
01:02:22,294 --> 01:02:23,905
late at night.

846
01:02:23,905 --> 01:02:25,604
So instead of her, let me...

847
01:02:27,874 --> 01:02:29,035
No.

848
01:02:57,865 --> 01:03:00,235
You should have told me that you came.

849
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,675
Why did you just stand
there knocking on the door?

850
01:03:09,945 --> 01:03:12,715
Do you want to have ramyeon before you go?

851
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:19,754
What is ramyeon? And where
do you want me to go?

852
01:03:20,825 --> 01:03:23,794
No pressure. It's just a kind of research.

853
01:03:23,965 --> 01:03:25,195
Or a test.

854
01:03:26,124 --> 01:03:28,095
No. I shouldn't do this.

855
01:03:30,235 --> 01:03:31,805
But if it's just a bite...

856
01:03:31,805 --> 01:03:32,805
No, no.

857
01:03:33,004 --> 01:03:35,135
Ramyeon has such an addictive taste.

858
01:03:35,135 --> 01:03:37,305
Once you start eating it, you can't stop.

859
01:03:38,845 --> 01:03:40,104
What are you doing?

860
01:03:44,715 --> 01:03:46,184
An inner conflict.

861
01:03:53,555 --> 01:03:55,155
What would you do if it were you?

862
01:03:55,524 --> 01:03:58,265
Do you think you're going
to eat ramyeon or not?

863
01:03:58,695 --> 01:04:01,235
I think I will explain what ramyeon is first.

864
01:04:03,765 --> 01:04:05,735
- First,
- First?

865
01:04:06,465 --> 01:04:07,675
I will try it.

866
01:04:08,204 --> 01:04:09,235
Right?

867
01:04:09,735 --> 01:04:11,874
You know how it is only after you try it.

868
01:04:11,874 --> 01:04:13,814
If it's just a one-time thing as I was drunk,

869
01:04:13,814 --> 01:04:15,345
or if I have really gone mad,

870
01:04:15,345 --> 01:04:17,044
or if this is...

871
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:20,044
real.

872
01:04:21,555 --> 01:04:24,124
Are we speaking the same language right now?

873
01:04:24,985 --> 01:04:26,024
Sure.

874
01:04:26,555 --> 01:04:28,495
We're talking about the ramyeon.

875
01:04:30,354 --> 01:04:33,294
Come closer. Ramyeon is
the best when it's hot.

876
01:04:33,294 --> 01:04:34,465
DONGMONGSEONSEUP

877
01:04:35,635 --> 01:04:36,735
What are you doing with this?

878
01:04:36,934 --> 01:04:38,535
Oh, my!

879
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:40,405
What should I do? This
is such a precious book.

880
01:04:56,555 --> 01:04:59,024
What do you think this is
that you said it is precious?

881
01:05:01,224 --> 01:05:04,965
Why is Dongmongseonseup precious to you?

882
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:08,195
It's...

883
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:11,265
Was it you?

884
01:05:14,374 --> 01:05:17,104
The person who saved me. Was it you?

885
01:05:17,274 --> 01:05:19,774
Did you save me from the well?

886
01:05:33,084 --> 01:05:34,095
Yes.

887
01:05:34,894 --> 01:05:35,995
It was me.

888
01:05:49,104 --> 01:05:53,504
MR. QUEEN

889
01:06:13,794 --> 01:06:16,964
<i>My Cheoljong will be desperately
waiting for me to come.</i>

890
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:19,235
<i>Did you dig a trap?</i>

891
01:06:19,235 --> 01:06:22,304
<i>I cannot believe the fight
the Queen declared was real.</i>

892
01:06:22,304 --> 01:06:23,844
<i>- Is it my turn?
- Draw your sword.</i>

893
01:06:23,844 --> 01:06:27,005
<i>If someone did not clean up
after himself and leaves a trace,</i>

894
01:06:27,005 --> 01:06:28,945
<i>he will have to take
responsibility for everything.</i>

895
01:06:28,945 --> 01:06:30,014
<i>Even though I removed the Kim clan,</i>

896
01:06:30,014 --> 01:06:31,915
<i>Kim Byeong In is becoming more powerful.</i>

897
01:06:31,915 --> 01:06:33,785
<i>I feel like there is no progress.</i>

898
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:36,955
<i>If Cheoljong makes it, the world
200 years later will change as well.</i>

899
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:38,985
<i>As long as I'm on your side, you will win.</i>

900
01:06:38,985 --> 01:06:40,755
<i>I have a secret weapon.</i>

901
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:42,094
<i>I know the future.</i>
