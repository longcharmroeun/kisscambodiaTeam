MR. QUEEN: THE SECRET

00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,490
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL AND
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,

8
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,660
AND EVENTS ARE UNRELATED
TO HISTORICAL EVENTS.

9
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,399
I, Court Lady Choi,

10
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:03,840
has been living in the palace for 30 years.

11
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,270
I know everything that
goes on in this palace.

12
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:10,209
Not only the secrets of
everyone in the palace...

13
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,750
but also the other side of every
incident unfolding without a break.

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,410
Let me tell you.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,979
There is nothing I do not
know about in this palace.

16
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,190
I want to go back!

17
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:27,190
But I have no idea...

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,789
why Her Highness is acting like that.

19
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,759
Your Highness.

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,009
In the palace, everyone has secrets.

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,309
Let us unveil...

22
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:45,179
the secrets that seem
too trivial to reveal...

23
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,280
but provoke too much curiosity to ignore.

24
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:56,720
THE SECRET OF THE GUY FRIEND

25
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,259
CCTV

26
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:07,369
TEST, AUTHENTIC MASTERPIECE, PERVERT

27
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,539
There are so many words I still
do not know the meaning of.

28
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,410
I have no other choice.

29
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,880
I should ask the Queen in person.

30
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,060
Why are you coming out from here?

32
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,259
I came to keep Her Highness company.

33
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,569
Do you have nothing better to do?

34
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,299
What is your job?

35
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,069
I am an envoy.

36
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:48,440
- Leave immediately.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

37
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,579
Run.

38
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,150
Today, I will make sure...

39
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,359
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,060
What are you doing here, Your Majesty?

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,630
Does a husband need a reason...

42
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,500
to visit his wife?

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,799
I also just came...

44
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,470
to see if Her Highness is doing well.

45
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,410
Then please excuse me.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,979
The Queen is doing well.

47
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,489
Poor fellow.

48
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,799
They say the early bird catches the worm.

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,759
Today, I will make sure...

50
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,569
Your, Your Majesty.

51
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,470
Even you, Royal Chef?

52
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,139
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,210
What brings you here in
the morning, Your Majesty?

54
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,079
Do you not sleep at all?

55
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,380
As I got older, I wake
up early in the morning.

56
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,590
Prepare the meal.

57
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,460
Already?

58
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,530
I will have a big breakfast.

59
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,260
A big meal in the morning?

60
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,229
Give it to me quickly!

61
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,169
Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,669
- His Majesty has come.
- Fine!

63
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,640
Let's do it again! Let's
do it again, Your Highness.

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,039
Yes, do it again.

65
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,080
- 2 syllables, about relationships.
- 2 syllables, about relationships.

66
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,249
Romance.

67
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,450
Romance. A good choice.

68
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,220
- Friendship.
- I had not thought of that.

69
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,660
Passion.

70
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,900
You lose. Come here.

71
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,960
Urine.

72
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,660
- Urine!
- Don't try to get away with it.

73
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:55,830
Indian Rice!

74
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,900
Why does it not count?

75
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,869
It could be like "You're in"
my heart, can it not? It hurts!

76
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,010
Wait... Urine!

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,979
- Indian Rice!
- It hurts!

78
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,580
- Urine!
- Oh, my goodness.

79
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,460
You are here.

80
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,390
- You're here.
- Have you arrived, Your Majesty?

81
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,200
I was going to Seonjeongjeon
Hall. I took a wrong turn.

82
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:35,340
Loving.

83
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,439
- Come here.
- Standing.

84
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,419
How are you guys so strong?

85
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,450
The Queen is always surrounded by men.

86
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,989
- Special Director Hong.
- I am not doing it!

87
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,489
- Let me go!
- No!

88
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,330
Not there!

89
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,960
- Oh, my.
- Not there!

90
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,160
We do not even know each other, do we?

91
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,369
Books for your hormones are the best kind.

92
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,309
I cannot believe I am reading an
erotic fiction fit for teenagers.

93
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,350
Your Highness.

94
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,080
You cannot read such books, Your Highness.

95
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,989
I have to read it because I have
to learn the Korean alphabet.

96
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,059
I am not finished... Oh, yes.

97
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,869
Hold on, hold on.

98
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,340
Let me read it one more time.

99
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,179
Your Highness, His Majesty has come to visit.

100
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:03,129
What are you reading so intently?

101
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,299
Do you want to read it too?

102
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:09,499
- My goodness.
- A rat!

103
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,640
A rat.

104
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,439
A rat as big as a calf was passing by.

105
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,410
Forgive me for surprising you, Your Majesty.

106
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,150
If it's as big as a calf, it
must be a calf, not a rat!

107
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,150
Where is the book I was reading?

108
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,520
Your Highness.

109
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:29,390
It is time to go to Daejojeon Hall.

110
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,619
Right. Everyone must be there, right?

111
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,660
"Everyone"?

112
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,600
- I guess you have plans.
- Yes.

113
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,530
- With whom?
- Someone.

114
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,869
Of course, it is someone.

115
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:50,210
I am asking if it is more than one person.

116
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,379
What are you trying to ask?

117
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,150
Just ask me what you really want to ask.

118
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,780
I'm not one to put much effort...

119
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,280
into figuring out your real intention.

120
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,489
There is no "real intention".

121
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:03,850
- But there is.
- I said there is not.

122
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,090
Are you sulking?

123
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,629
What do you mean I am sulking?

124
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:12,260
The king never sulks.

125
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:17,299
I just came to find a book I need.

126
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,669
Do not disturb.

127
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,309
Oh, it is right here.

128
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,640
The book I was looking for.

129
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,179
"As Eunuch Kim untied the
string of his jacket,"

130
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:30,150
"my heart also..." What?

131
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,950
What is this?

132
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,550
I finally found something we have in common.

133
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,290
We share the same interests.

134
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,729
"We"?

135
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,529
I'll leave you alone so that you can
enjoy the book for your hormones.

136
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm off.

137
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,399
Wait.

138
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:50,129
I have something I want to ask you, My Queen.

139
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,200
What is it?

140
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,269
It is nothing big.

141
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,739
Who is the one...

142
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,649
you cherish the most?

143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,779
Hong Yeon.

144
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,080
Oh, Court Lady Choi as well.

145
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,119
That is not what I mean.

146
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,859
Leave us alone. Go.

147
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,430
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Quickly.

148
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,899
Do not walk backwards. Turn
around and walk out quickly.

149
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:25,970
Hurry up.

150
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,409
What is it that you are taking so long?

151
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,409
Please be honest with me.

152
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,180
It depends on the question.

153
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,080
I will not say it if you
are not going to be honest.

154
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,649
Forget it, then.

155
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,989
Among men!

156
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:44,220
Among men, who do you cherish the most?

157
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,729
Jang Bong Hwan.

158
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,540
And who might that be?

159
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,070
He is...

160
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:04,139
the only man in the world who is perfect.

161
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,279
He's the coolest guy I know.

162
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:10,080
He's got everything.

163
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,979
He's got looks, a great personality,

164
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,680
incredible skills with a blade,

165
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,989
and a mastery of all theories,
which makes him the ultimate man.

166
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,820
He's the best.

167
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,519
He always feels new. He makes me thrilled!

168
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,259
Why are you not with him
if you value him so much?

169
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,399
I know, right?

170
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,129
Because we can't be together,

171
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,070
I long for him and miss him more.

172
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:33,940
I'm crazy for him.

173
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,180
Are you sighing because of this
fellow called Jang Bong Hwan?

174
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,479
Do you miss him so much...

175
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
that you cannot even sleep
and even feel depressed?

176
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,279
No way.

177
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,249
Are you jealous?

178
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,090
That's cute.

179
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,019
Cute?

180
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,359
What? What are you doing?

181
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,999
Yes. I am jealous.

182
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,830
You are not public property.

183
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,300
So do not say "we" carelessly.

184
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,540
That is an order.

185
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:11,639
I do not want anyone else...

186
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,979
to call you "my dear
Queen" or even "my sister".

187
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,409
Also...

188
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,859
Do you still find me cute?

189
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,899
Yes. You're cute.

190
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,800
But not as much as I am.

191
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,619
What on earth...

192
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:53,979
is this overused, conventional
heart-throbbing scene...

193
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,519
from a romance cartoon?

194
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,859
I would never fall for something like this.

195
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,129
Or would I?

196
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,670
- Jindo Dog One is issued.
- Pardon?

197
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,170
- This won't do. I must check.
- Check?

198
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,710
If this heart belongs to the body...

199
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,509
or to the soul.

200
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,810
I must check...

201
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,060
Go ahead and check.

202
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,070
Why does it feel good? It's upsetting.

203
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,509
No. Stop it, Kim So Yong.

204
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,040
Stop it. Stop it already.

205
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,779
Does this upset you that much?

206
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,619
I shouldn't be like this.

207
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:02,889
My gosh.

208
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,729
I should not be like this either.

209
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,690
There are many interesting
books in the library.

210
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,729
But nothing is more interesting...

211
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:48,930
than the true character of the
gentle elders in the palace.

212
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,139
In the palace, everyone has secrets.

213
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,879
Let us unveil...

214
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,840
the secrets that seem
too trivial to reveal...

215
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,779
but provoke too much curiosity to ignore.

216
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:18,659
THE SECRET OF THE REAL SIBLINGS

217
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,769
QUEEN SUNWON

218
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,509
KIM JWA GEUN

219
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,509
KIM MUN GEUN

220
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,420
It would be perfect if
I get a tiger card now.

221
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:47,489
By the way, a tiger attacked a town...

222
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:49,659
in the Yeongnam region.

223
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,659
It caused quite the ruckus.

224
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,369
I see. She needs the tiger card.

225
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:56,470
What is worse...

226
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,700
is the rumor that says...

227
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,970
there is strange energy
of the dragon in the sky.

228
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,609
He needs the dragon card.

229
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,149
Whichever it is, I am doomed.

230
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,060
What are you doing? Play your hand.

231
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,460
Where did the tujeon player go?

232
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:25,200
Actually,

233
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,869
because the game is so interesting,

234
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,239
my heart is throbbing.

235
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:39,239
Actually, if I do not play the right hand,

236
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,580
I am worried...

237
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,680
that you will chew me up.

238
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:57,159
"My heart is throbbing."

239
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,629
"You will chew me up."

240
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,700
Court Lady Chun.

241
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,369
Is this so funny?

242
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:07,970
I apologize, Your Highness.

243
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,840
Hurry up and play your hand.

244
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,340
Her Highness is waiting.

245
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,580
There. Oh, my goodness.

246
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,720
My hands were sweaty. I
accidentally put down two cards.

247
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,320
This round does not count. Let us start over.

248
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,249
- We cannot do that.
- I agree.

249
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,960
As the younger brother, you should give up.

250
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,369
As the elder sister, you should give up.

251
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,800
I made concessions to you
throughout my whole life...

252
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,840
for being born a woman.

253
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,070
Have you forgotten that you had
all the honors to yourself...

254
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,340
since you became Queen?

255
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,310
Is that what I get in return for raising you?

256
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,409
I do not know about that.

257
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,680
All I remember is serving you.

258
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,920
Calm down. Please do not fight.

259
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,489
Blood is thicker than these mere cards.

260
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,530
Ever since we were young,
every time we played,

261
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,129
we would always growl at each other.

262
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,169
We are very competitive.

263
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,469
That is right.

264
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,209
No matter how old we get,

265
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,139
I am just a child before you.

266
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,250
I will make a concession. You should take it.

267
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,050
No, you should take this first.

268
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,389
- Brother.
- Sister.

269
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,560
My goodness. Look at you.

270
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,859
You are both competitive...

271
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,429
and yet you both make
concessions so generously.

272
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,429
Anyone can tell that you are
siblings. You are so alike.

273
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,570
- That is not true!
- That is not true!

274
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,810
Then, for the sake of your relationship,

275
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,510
let us say that I won this round.

276
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,010
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

277
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,889
I want to go home.

278
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,399
From the southeastern sky,

279
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,030
there is a red energy
shooting towards the palace.

280
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,270
It is as strong as fire.

281
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:22,270
The river flows backwards.

282
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,369
Frogs rain down from the sky.

283
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,179
A series of strange events are occurring.

284
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,649
Everyone is confused and worried...

285
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,020
about such inauspicious signs.

286
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,179
Word among the people is that...

287
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:38,189
it is a sign of the end
of the world drawing near.

288
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,490
I am worried.

289
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,959
Is...

290
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,199
the world really coming to an end?

291
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,679
THE SECRET OF DESTRUCTION

292
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,359
Tonight,

293
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,129
the sky will fall.

294
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,340
Fire will fall from the sky,

295
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:33,780
and everything will burn.

296
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,719
It will turn into a blazing inferno.

297
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,050
Maybe the world...

298
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,889
has always been ready to be destroyed.

299
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,730
It is not strange even if the world
comes to an end at any moment.

300
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,500
If you had that so, you should have told us.

301
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,330
If I had known, I would
not have worked so hard.

302
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,969
I would have enjoyed my life at ease.

303
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,369
This darned world.

304
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,109
I do not think...

305
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,609
the world will come to an end so easily.

306
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,179
Even small creatures like us...

307
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,179
struggle to survive.

308
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,189
The world would not be that weak.

309
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,419
So let us stop thinking about it,

310
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,459
and focus on finishing the book on tactics.

311
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:24,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:26,500
Bring the brush and ink.

313
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,770
You are going to squeeze me out to the end?

314
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,070
I am not doing this.

315
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,300
Special Director Hong.

316
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,369
What if this really is
the last day of my life?

317
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,540
I do not want to die working to the end.

318
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,980
You should consider today as your last day,

319
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,780
and do what you want.

320
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,080
That is why I want to
finish creating this book.

321
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,990
It is something I want
to finish before I die.

322
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,320
You are a fool who is obsessed with work.

323
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,619
You need to watch your mouth.

324
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:55,760
What do you care?

325
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,129
It all ends once the world comes to an end.

326
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,959
Did you just talk informally to me?

327
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes. Yes, I did.

328
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,199
We are all about to die.

329
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,369
I cannot afford to be polite.

330
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:07,139
Calm down, Special Director Hong.

331
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:09,369
Won Beom, you punk. You are the worst.

332
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,909
You are a corrupt employer
pretending to be my friend.

333
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,209
Your Majesty. I too must do
something on my last day of life.

334
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,780
Even if this day is my last,

335
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,050
I will fix your manners for you before I die.

336
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,689
Gosh. You are so authoritative
just because you are a bit older.

337
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,830
Plus, did you have to be that tall?

338
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,199
Did you eat all the
potatoes on Ganghwa Island?

339
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,770
That is cold.

340
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,070
I finally came to my senses.

341
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,800
I will stop right there.

342
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,209
It is 5pm.

343
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:51,050
It will soon be nightfall.

344
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,520
Is today really the last day?

345
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,159
Where are you going?

346
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,590
I have changed my mind.

347
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,689
If the world ends tonight,

348
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,129
where I should be...

349
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:09,030
and with whom I should be
not to have any regrets.

350
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,310
It's fine. Don't worry.

351
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:21,409
I said it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.

352
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,850
Still, there are rumors.

353
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,350
Don't trust the rumors.

354
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,449
It's fine. It's all right.

355
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,219
It's okay. My goodness. I said it's fine.

356
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,219
Don't trust those rumors.

357
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,659
His Majesty is here.

358
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:46,270
Are you also unable to sleep...

359
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,000
in fear of the world coming to an end?

360
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,639
Come to an end, my foot.

361
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:52,580
I was comforting them
because they were so worried.

362
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:56,149
I can't ignore the woes of women.

363
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,879
How kind of you.

364
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:00,949
Hey. Royal Chef.

365
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,619
What are you still doing here at this hour?

366
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,830
Your Highness.

367
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,869
What?

368
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:21,340
Is something good going on?

369
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:29,949
Are you that scared of dying, Man Bok?

370
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:32,280
I was scared. What?

371
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,449
My eyes were just tearing
up from chopping scallions.

372
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:38,020
Is that so? Sure, sure.

373
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,459
My goodness.

374
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,830
I have always been in on
such important rumors.

375
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,760
How come I was not aware
of the end of the world?

376
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,230
Anyway, it is getting late.

377
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,149
Gosh, it's cold.

378
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,050
See? I told you. Nothing's happening.

379
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,790
You all had me scared. Let's go.

380
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,850
- Let's go.
- The Queen is right.

381
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:15,189
You should stop worrying and go to bed.

382
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:16,689
Yes, Your Majesty.

383
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:17,959
Hurry up.

384
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,830
Your Highness. Is that...

385
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,980
A meteor shower.

386
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,879
A meteor shower.

387
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,990
Is that rain?

388
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,030
How is it that the end of
the world is so beautiful?

389
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:04,169
Please let me go back to my healthy body.

390
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,179
While I'm lying in bed in a coma,

391
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,409
please don't let me lose muscle mass.

392
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,310
My Queen.

393
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,520
If you see a shooting star,
make a wish and it'll come true.

394
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,149
Make a wish. Hurry.

395
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,719
Make a wish.

396
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,730
A wish?

397
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,070
Let Cheoljong live longer than
what the history books say...

398
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,139
and live happily ever after...

399
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,510
like a prince in a fairy tale.

400
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,080
Please let me be born as a stone...

401
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,649
in my next life.

402
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:49,719
Why do you want to be a stone?

403
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:52,490
So I will not have to do
anything and live comfortably.

404
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,959
Then in my next life,

405
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:59,260
I will kick that stone.

406
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:09,310
In my next life,

407
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,310
let me be born as Her Highness' mother.

408
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:14,510
Please let me succeed...

409
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,149
in rehabilitating Her
Majesty in my next life.

410
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,080
In my next life, let me be born
as Her Highness' elder sister.

411
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,520
So she would not be lonely.

412
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:26,689
It was a good life.

413
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,760
I hope my next life is as good as this life.

414
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,330
If...

415
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,300
I am ever reborn in my next life...

416
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:45,139
I told you to make a wish,

417
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,209
but it seems you're all
wishing to be born again.

418
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,350
What did you wish to be born as?

419
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,850
No matter how much I think about it,

420
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,320
I do not want to be born again.

421
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:57,189
No wonder.

422
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,020
If you pour so much into this life,

423
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,929
you wouldn't want to be born again.

424
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:05,060
It's okay even if it's hard.

425
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:07,100
I know you're trying hard.

426
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:10,100
I know you're trying so hard not to crumble.

427
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,439
Still, I want you to be reborn.

428
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,980
I've learned something
from living a second life.

429
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,409
Trivial things that I
would probably regret...

430
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,580
if I hadn't known about them.

431
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,449
Right. I would have regretted it so much...

432
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,159
if my life ended without meeting...

433
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,919
such a strange person like you.

434
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:36,730
Who knows?

435
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,330
I might show up before you in an
unexpected and strange form...

436
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,560
once again.

437
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,000
So you have to be reborn.

438
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,869
You are already unexpected enough even now.

439
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,389
My family died on the same day.

440
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,760
I hope to meet them again in the afterlife.

441
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,580
Are you okay?

442
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,050
Did you make a wish?

443
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,080
There is one more wish.

444
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,990
I know it cannot happen now,

445
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:41,689
but one day,

446
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,100
I want to...

447
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,070
watch the sun setting in the distance...

448
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:53,840
with the person I long for.

449
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:10,990
How nice it would have been
for her to be here as well.

450
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:43,889
What's with this mood?

451
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,790
No in-house romance.

452
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,330
You cannot date your family.

453
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,929
That is not what I meant.

454
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,629
I am a man of much guilt.

455
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,939
I am a woman of much guilt.

456
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,340
I said, no in-house romance.

457
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,020
When I am born again, I
hope to meet My Queen again.

458
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:21,119
Even if we misunderstand,
hate each other and fight,

459
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,629
I hope we recognize each other in the end.

460
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,730
I hope we meet again not as King and Queen,

461
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:28,730
but as So Yong and Won Beom.

462
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,639
Everyone. Dismissed.

463
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,469
Dismissed.

464
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,280
Your Highness. The flames
are falling this way.

465
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,149
Your Highness. Maybe
there is a fire somewhere.

466
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,350
We are doomed.

467
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,219
- We are totally doomed.
- Fire.

468
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,250
We're not doomed.

469
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,659
Wish for it a million
times. It will never happen.

470
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,330
Look. It may be a mess,
but it's running fine.

471
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,760
Seriously.

472
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,929
This darned world is darn strong.

473
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,270
It is a darned world, but it never ends.

474
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,369
Oh, dear.

475
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,669
