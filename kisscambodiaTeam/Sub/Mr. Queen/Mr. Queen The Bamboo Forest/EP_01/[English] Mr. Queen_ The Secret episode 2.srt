[Mr. Queen: The Secret]

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,190
The characters, organizations, and events in this drama are unrelated to any historical facts and all stories are fictional.

4
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,410
I, Court Lady Choi, have lived in the palace for 30 years.

5
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,740
I'm seeing through everything in this palace.

6
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,270
Not only the secrets of all the people in the palace,

7
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,140
even the other side story of all the hectic incidents happening.

8
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,860
I can assure you that there is nothing I don't know in this palace.

9
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,490
I want to go back~!

10
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:31,500
But I really can't understand why Her Majesty the Queen is acting like that...

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,490
Your Majesty...?

12
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,200
Inside the palace, everyone has a secret.

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,480
To reveal, it's too trivial. But to cover it up, you get so curious.

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,100
Those trivial secrets will now be unfolded.

15
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,030
[The Secret of Male Friends]

16
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,150
... Anti-Fan... Good Morning... Mission... Sexy, Cute and Innocent... Show Window...

17
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,600
... Republic of Korea - Joseon's future, Gold Spoon/Dirt Spoon - Confirming the class, Vote - Once over 18 years old...

18
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,250
There are still many words which meaning I don't know.

19
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,470
There is no other choice but to meet the Queen and ask her myself.

20
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,930
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,930
Why are you coming out of that room?

22
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,560
I just came to have a chat with Her Majesty.

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,360
Do you not have any work to do?

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,490
What's your job?

25
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,600
- I'm belonging to the delegation department. 
 - Then, leave immediately.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,120
Run!

28
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,900
I'll definitely see her todayâ€”

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,130
What brings you here again, Director of Uigeumbu? (Royal Investigation Bureau)

30
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,930
Then, what brings you here, Your Majesty?

31
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,390
Is any specific reason required when a husband visits his wife?

32
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,340
I also just came to check if Her Majesty is doing well.

33
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,900
Then.

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,890
The Queen is doing alright.

35
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,100
Gosh, what a pitiful guy he is.

36
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,020
They say the early bird gets the worm.

37
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,760
Today, I will definitelyâ€”

38
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,130
Oh, Y-Y-Your Majesty...

39
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,460
- Even you, Head Chef? 
 - Ah, yes.

40
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,300
Ah, well, what brings you here this early in the morning?

41
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,030
Don't you need to sleep?

42
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,720
Well, as I get older, I lose my early morning sleep.

43
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,400
Prepare my meal.

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,300
Already?

45
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,630
Today, I'd like to have a big feast table.

46
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,760
A big feast table for your breakfast?

47
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,900
Hurry up, this is your penalty!

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,990
Officer Hong!

49
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,440
- His Majesty the King is here! 
 - Alright! One more!

50
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,270
- Let's do one more round. 
 - Okay, let's do it again.

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,970
Starting with i-eung and ji-eut. (a vowel and 'J' sound)

52
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,400
- Yeong-jeong. (meaning 'crush')  
 - That's right, there was Yeong-jeong.

53
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,170
- U-jeong. (meaning 'friendship')  
 - Oh, right! 
 - I've got one!

54
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,200
Yeol-jeong! (meaning 'passion')

55
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,770
Ah, now you've failed! it's you again.

56
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,890
- Oh, there is O-jum. (meaning 'urine') 
 - Come on!

57
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,560
- This is your penalty! Yeah! 
 - This is wrong!

58
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,830
Who doesn't take a piss? Argh!

59
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,270
- O-jum! 
 - Penalty!

60
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,470
- Yay!  
 - Oh, gosh!

61
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,080
(without honorifics) You're here?

62
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,000
(without honorifics) You're here?

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,010
You're here, Your Majesty.

64
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,050
I was going to go to Cheonjeongjeon, but took a wrong turn.

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,760
Ae-Jeong! (meaning 'love')

66
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,140
- Hey, give up your back, you need more beatings. 
 - Oh, come on!

67
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,250
How come your beating is so painful?

68
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,230
Next to the queen, there are always men around her.

69
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,970
- Yes, yes! 
 - Gosh, one more round!

70
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,820
Not there! Please, not there!

71
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,260
Aren't we just acquainted? Oh, please...

72
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,130
As expected, rather than food for mind, food for hormones are the best.

73
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,080
But, this romance novel is just at the level of middle schoolers.

74
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,250
Your Majesty,

75
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,890
you mustn't keep reading such books like that.

76
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,990
I have to practise reading as I'm learning Eon-mun. (meaning 'Hangeul', Korean letters)

77
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,220
Oh, not yet, yes.

78
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,790
Oh! Wow.

79
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,980
Wait wait wait wait, let me read it just one more time.

80
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,780
God!

81
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,950
Your Majesty, His Majesty the King is here.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,830
What are you reading so intently?

83
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,310
-Oh, do you want to read it too?
-AH
-Oh that surprised me.

84
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,110
RAT! RAT!

85
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,610
There was a rat the size of a calf.

86
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,480
So I'm so sorry for surprising everyone, Your Majesty.

87
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,100
Well if it's the size of a calf, then it must be a calf, why is it a rat?

88
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,370
Wait, where did it go? The thing I was reading?

89
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,420
Your Majesty, it's time to go back to your quarters.

90
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,230
-Right, is everyone there?
-Everyone?

91
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,350
- It seems like you have an appointment. 
 - Yup.

92
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,140
- With whom? 
 - Someone.

93
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,270
Obviously.

94
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,900
But I meant if you had just one or more.

95
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,620
What do you want to ask?

96
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,120
Just ask it frankly.

97
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm not empathetic enough to read your hidden intentions.

98
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,330
There isn't any hidden intention, though.

99
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,590
- There is! 
 - I told you, there isn't.

100
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,430
Are you sulking now?

101
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,040
Sulking!? Kings are never sulking!

102
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,610
I'm just, here to get a book I need,

103
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,480
Don't bother me.

104
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,750
Oh, here it is.

105
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,800
The book I was looking for.

106
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,670
"As Eunuch Kim unties my coat string, my mind was alsoâ€”." What?

107
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,930
Wha-What is this?

108
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,840
Finally, we found something in common.

109
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,990
Our hobbies are the same.

110
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:45,260
- 'We'?  
 - Then, enjoy your food for hormones. See you.

111
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,650
Wait,

112
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,700
I want to ask you something.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,850
What?

114
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,220
It's nothing much

115
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,420
But you know, the person that you cherish the most,

116
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,510
who is that?

117
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,530
Hong Yeon.

118
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,920
And our Court Lady Choi, too.

119
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,830
That's not what I meant.

120
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,570
Everyone, leave us alone for a moment. Get out.

121
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,930
- Yes, your majesty. 
 - Quickly!

122
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,780
Not backwards, but turn around and quickly go out!

123
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,990
What is it about so that you take so much time?

124
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,220
Please answer truthfully.

125
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,530
- It depends on the question. 
 - If you wouldn't be truthful, then I won't speak.

126
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:45,040
- Then, don't. 
 - M-M-Men! Among men, whom do you cherish the most?

127
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,840
Jang Bong-hwan.

128
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,370
Who is that?

129
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,430
Who is he...?

130
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,010
The one and only perfect man in the world.

131
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,370
He's the most charming man I know.

132
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,980
I mean it. He doesn't have a single thing missing.

133
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,170
Looks are looks, personality is personality

134
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,580
And that amazing knife skills of his...

135
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,830
The ultimate existence who is even perfect in books too.  Damn, he's the best.

136
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,470
He's always refreshing, so thrilling!

137
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,250
Then, why aren't you with such a man you're cherishing?

138
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,200
Exactly!

139
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,650
Because I couldn't be with him, it's more ardent, more regrettable and more heartrending.

140
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,180
It's driving me crazy, really.

141
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,760
Are you sighing because of that man, Jang Bong-hwan!?

142
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,010
Because of your longing for him, do you even lose sleep and feel lonely?

143
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,390
Wait, are you being jealous?

144
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,800
How cute.

145
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,800
Cute?

146
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,560
What? Why? What is it?

147
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,790
You're right, it is jealousy.

148
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:08,430
You're not public goods for everybody. So please no longer use the word, 'we', recklessly.

149
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,440
It's a royal command.

150
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,010
I don't want you to be called 'my cousin' or 'our Queen', either.

151
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,520
Also, am I still cute?

152
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,690
You're cute, very cute, although you can't still beat me.

153
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,840
What's this clichÃ© of heart-throbbing moment, which was used 5 trillion and 5 hundred times already for romance comic books?

154
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,710
My heart would never get fluttered by thisâ€”

155
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,690
Or not?

156
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,850
DEFCON Level 1!

157
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,630
Pardon me?

158
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,310
This won't do, I have to confirm it.

159
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,140
Confirm it?

160
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,120
Whether this is my body's mind or my soul's mind.

161
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,710
I should... confirm... it...

162
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,930
Let's do it, confirm.

163
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:45,520
â™« Like the faded moonlight â™«

164
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,990
Why do I like it? It angers me. 
 â™« That is covered by the cloud  â™«

165
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,550
Argh, don't do it, Kim So-yong. Don't do it, don't do it!

166
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,080
Don't do it, don't!

167
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,820
Is this angering you that much?

168
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,350
Ah, I'm not supposed to be like this, damn it.

169
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:11,540
I'm also not supposed to be like this.

170
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:20,600
â™« And at the moment your beautiful face is also soaked in  â™«

171

173
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,300
In the library, there are so many interesting books like this.

174
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:49,760
But there is nothing more interesting than the true nature of elders in the palace.

175
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,590
Inside the palace, everyone has a secret.

176
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,930
To reveal, it's too trivial. But to cover it up, you get so curious.

177
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,200
Those trivial secrets will now be unfolded.

[Kim Mun-geun]

182
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,730
If I get a tiger stick now, that will be perfect.

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,000
By the way, I heard about a huge incident that a tiger attacked the town in Gyeongsang Province.

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,100
Oh, she must need a tiger stick.

185
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:03,750
A bigger problem is the rumour that the people are feeling the unusual spirit of dragon floating in the sky.

186
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,460
So, he needs a dragon stick.

187
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,070
No matter which stick I give up, I'm screwed.

188
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,830
What are you doing? You should give up one stick.

189
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,590
Where is the gambler gone?

190
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,050
The thing is... As this game is so nerve-wracking,

191
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,090
my heart feels like mun-geun, mun-geun, you know? 
(sounds similar to 'softy and clotty')

192
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,710
In fact, if I put down a wrong stick,

193
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:45,520
you two seem to chew me up jwa-geun, jwa-geun. (T/N: sounds similar to a Korean mimetic word, 'jal-geun, jal-geun', the way of chewing)

194
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,220
He said, his heart feels like mun-geun, mun-geun,

195
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,600
and you two chew up jwa-geun, jwa-geun.

196
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,210
Court Lady Cheon!

197
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,190
Is that funny?!

198
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,270
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,200
Hurry up and play your stick! Her Royal Highness is waiting for you!

200
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,330
Damn!

201
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,530
Oh dear... Because of my hand's sweat, I happened to drop two sticks.

202
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,190
This round went wrong, so let's reshuffle them and start it over.

203
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,220
We can't do that!

204
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,920
You're absolutely right, Your Highness.

205
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,740
As the courtesy of a younger brother, why don't you yield?

206
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,210
As the courtesy of an older sister, why don't you yield?

207
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,590
As I was born a woman, I've lived my entire life conceding everything for you.

208
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:45,330
Every since you became the queen, you've monopolized all the fame and honour of family. Have you forgotten it?

209
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,020
I carried you on my back and raised you, and this is how you pay me?

210
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,960
I don't know about that, but all the memories I have are serving you, Sister.

211
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,870
Well, well, well, please don't fight.

212
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,210

[Dragon / Tiger]

214
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,560
Ever since we were little, whenever we play games, I've always argued and gotten angry with you, Brother.

215
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,930
Because both of us are so competitive.

216
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,800
That's right.

217
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,990
No matter how much we get older, I'm just a child in front of you, Sister.

218
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,040
I'll concede, take it, Brother.

219
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,860
No, you should take it first, Sister.

220
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,970
You do it, Brother.

221
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,560
You do it, Sister.

222
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,760
Oh my, you two are...

223
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,730
The competitiveness that you don't want to lose,

224
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,220
and even the wildness when you concede.

225
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,030
Anyone can say that you two are siblings.  You two look alike so much.

226
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,620
- There is no way we look alike! 
 - There is no way we look alike!

227
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,530
Then... For the sibling's love between you two,

228
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,450
let's say I won this round.

229
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,360
- What do you mean?! 
 - What do you mean?!

230
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,330

There is some red energy, coming from the Soutern-East direction and falling down into the palace.

235
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,660
Its intensity is like blaze,

236
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,180
and the river flows reversed,

237
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,360
and the rain of frogs comes down from the sky.

238
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,220
Everyday, some strange incidents are happening.

239
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,470
Due to all these ill-boding omens, everybody is confused and worried.

240
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:38,260
Among the people, there is a rumour that these are the omen for the world to end soon,

241
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,490
so there are very worrisome.

242
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,840
By any chance,

243
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,010
is the world really about to end?

Tonight, the sky will collapse.

246
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,790
The flames will fall from the sky,

247
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:34,960
and the entire world will burn in the sea of blaze!

248
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,820
It will become the sea of blaze!

249
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,530
The world might be always ready to be ended.

250
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,300
Whenever it ends, it won't feel strange.

251
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,310
If you have been thinking that way, you should've told me sooner.

252
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,320
If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have gone through so many hardships,

253
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,030
but just enjoyed my life before my death.

00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,140
Still,

256
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,390
I don't think this world will end so easily like this.

257
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,730
Even we, mere lives, are struggling to survive,

258
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,360
so the world can't be so fragile like that.

259
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,300
Therefore, let's stop worrying for no reason and expedite the completion of military strategy book.

If today is really the last day of our lives, what are you going to do?

266
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,390
I don't want to die while working until the last moment.

267
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,810
You too, Your Majesty, please consider today is the last day just in case,

268
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,700
and please do whatever you wanted to do.

269
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,230
That's why I'm suggesting to complete this military strategy book,

270
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,790
because this is the work I'd like to finish before I die.

Everything will be over anyway if the world ends.

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,720
Did you just drop the honorifics to me?

276
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,820
(without honorifics) That's right, I did!

277
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,230
We all are about to die, so why would I bother with manners?

278
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,980
Calm down, Officer Hong.

279
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,500
(without honorifics) Won-beom, you bastard, youre the worst.  What an evil boss disguised as a friend!

280
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,830
Your Majesty, I've got one thing I should do on the last day of my life.

281
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,930
Even if I die today, I will die after fixing your manners.

282
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,230
(without honorifics) Gosh, yeah, you're older than us, but you're too freaking authoritative.

283
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,600
Moreover, do you really have to be that tall?

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,230
You must have eaten all the potatoes by yourself in Ganghwa Island.

Oh, that's cold.

286
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,630
(with honorifics) I've come back to my senses now. My madness is over now.

287
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,560
It's the time of chicken (around 5~7 PM).

288
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,890
Soon, it will be the night.

289
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,350
Will today really be the end?

290
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,020
Where are you going?

291
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,540
I've changed my mind.

292
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,660
If tonight our lives end,

293
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,490
where I should be,

294
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,960
and whom I should be with so that I won't regret.

295
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,990
Gosh, it will be alright, don't worry.

296
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,030
It's okay, nothing will happen.

297
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,070
Still, the rumour is around.

298
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,290
Why do you believe a rumour? It's alright, alright.

299
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,570
Alright, alright.

300
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,660
It's alright, gosh, seriously.

301
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,960
I told you it would be alright.

302
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
Why do you believe such a rumour?

303
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,580
His Majesty the King is here.

304
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,340
Are you also worried if the world would end, so that you couldn't sleep?

305
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,720
What end of the world?  As they are too worried, I'm calming them down.

306
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,570
You know, I can't just pass by the worries of women.

307
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,720
You're kind.

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,570
What are you doing this late, instead of going home?

310
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,610
Your Majesty...

311
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,130
Is there something nice going on?

312
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,840
Our Man-bok was that scared to die?

313
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,290
Man-bok was scaredâ€”, damn!

314
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,480
You keep saying that to confuse me, although I said my eyes got teary while cutting green onions.

315
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,890
Oh, you did? Yes, yes, alright.

316
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,960
I'm through all the rumours in the palace,

317
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,220
but how come I alone didn't know about the end of world?

318
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,090
By the way, it has been a while since the night fell.

319
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,240
Gosh, it's too cold.

320
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,320
See? Nothing happened.

321
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,590
Geez, I got a bit worried for no reason too. Let's go, go.

322
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,810
The Queen is right,

323
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,340
you all stop worrying for nothing and go back to your quarters.

324
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

325
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,790
Let's go.

326
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,590
Your Majesty! T-T-That is...?

327
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,790
It's the meteor shower.

328
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,760
The Meteor shower? Are you saying that's rain?

329
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,890
How beautiful the end of world is...

330
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,040
Please allow me to go back to my original healthy body.

331
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,190
Please don't let my body lose any muscles while lying down in a vegetative state.

332
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,000
My Queen?

333
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,390
Ah, when there is meteor shower like that, if you make a wish, that wish will come true.

334
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,500
Make a wish, make a wish, a wish!

335
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,420
Make a wish.

336
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,570
A w-wish?

337
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,850
And for Cheoljong too, longer and longer than the history said,

338
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,710
please let him live happily ever after

339
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,320
like the prince in fairy tales.

340
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,140
In the next life, please,

341
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,610
please let me born as a rock.

342
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,850
Why a rock?

343
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,390
So that I can live comfortably, doing nothing.

344
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,130
Then, when I'm born again, I'll kick that rock away.

345
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,130
â™« That's why I'm telling you now â™«

346
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,660
â™« So that you wouldn't know  â™«

347
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,460
In my next life, please let me be Her Majesty the Queen's mother,

348
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,370
so that I can definitely succeed

349
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,630
in the rehabilitation of Her Majesty.

350
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,560
In my next life, please let me be Her Majesty's older sister,

351
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,060
so that Her Majesty won't feel lonely.

352
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,180
It was a nice life this time.

353
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:33,020
I wish my next life is exactly same as this life.

354
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:40,030
If I'm born again in the next life...

355
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,390
â™« I want to embrace you in my arms â™«

356
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,190
I told you to make a wish, but all of you seem to wish for the next life.

357
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,160
What did you wish to be born again?

358
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:56,000
No matter how much I thought, I don't want to be born again.

359
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,400
True, if one pours too much in the current life, he would get sick of being born again.

360
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,190
Even if everything is hard, it's alright,

361
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,780
as I know you're putting a lot of efforts.

362
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,020
How much you're trying to not collapse.

363
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,000
But, still, I wish you're born again.

364
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,340
As I've lived the second round of lives, there is something like this.

365
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,280
Those trivial things like, 'How wronged must I have felt if I didn't know this?'

366
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,830
True, how wronged must I have felt,

367
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,420
if I didn't get to meet such a strange person like you, my Queen,

368
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,400
before my life now ended?

369
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Who knows? I might appear in front of you in an unexpected and absurd shape.

370
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,600
So, you should be definitely born again.

371
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,600
You're already unexpected enough.

372
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,830
â™« Even I stretch my arm, I can't reach you â™«

373
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,650
â™« The only confession that I give you â™«

374
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,590
All my family, who left me at the same time, on the same day,

375
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,630
I wish I can meet them in the heaven at least...

376
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,030
â™« I want to embrace you in my arms â™«

377
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,900
â™« But it's okay even if I can't â™«

378
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:24,100
â™« You're the reason why I want to have a dream â™«

379
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,830
Are you alright?

380
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,940
â™« To you who is asleep, leaning on my shoulder â™«

381
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,760
Did you make a wish alright?

382
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,930
I have one more wish, though.

383
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,010
Although it won't work now,

384
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,150
in the distant future,

385
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,130
with the person I miss,

386
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,030
â™« As always, those two eyes like a child's â™«

387
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,920
I'd like to watch the sunset far away over there,

388
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,740
together with her. 
 â™« Without knowing any of my mind â™«

389
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,760
â™« They just stare at me â™«

390
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,260
â™« You know, whenever you look at me like that â™«

391
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,010
It would've been nice if she were with us. 
 â™« I want to hug you tightly â™«

392
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,900
â™« Will you know my crumbling mind? â™«

393
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,700
â™« You're the reason why I want to open my eyes â™«

394
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,400
â™« Lean on my shoulder now â™«

395
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,400
â™« I'm showing my feelings after a long time â™«

396
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,630
â™« I love you â™«

397
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,490
â™« To my one and only you â™«

398
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,220
What's with this mood? 
â™« To my one and only you â™«

399
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,630
No dating within the company, you know? 
(T/N: 'Sa-nae' = 'within the company')

400
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,140
How can men date each other? 
(T/N: 'Sanae' = 'man')

401
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,750
Oh, my 'sa-nae' doesn't mean that 'sanae' though...

402
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,460
I, this man, am a sinful man...

403
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,800
I, this woman, am a sinful woman.

404
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,290
No dating within the company.

405
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,530
If I'm born again, I wish I can meet the Queen again.

406
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,190
Even if we misunderstand, hate, and argue,

407
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,030
I wish we can recognize each other in the end.

408
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:29,690
Not as the king and the queen, but as So-yong and Won-beom, I wish we can meet again.

409
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,620
Dismissed! Dismissed, dismissed.

410
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,350
- Dismissed, dismissed. 
 - Your Majesty.

411
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,040
The flames are falling like that now.

412
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,100
What if there are some huge fire accidents somewhere?

413
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,320
We're doomed, doomed.

414
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,160
Fire all over the places...

415
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,060
Ah, gosh, I'm telling you, it won't end!

416
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,810
Even if you scream hundreds of times at the world to end, it won't end.

417
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,020
See? Even if everything is in a mess, the world is running well somehow.

418
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,110
Seriously, it's freaking sturdy, this damnable world.

419
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,080
Although it's a damnable world, it will never end, eh?

420
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,230
Geez...

421
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,910
[Mr. Queen: The Secret]

422
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:49,000
