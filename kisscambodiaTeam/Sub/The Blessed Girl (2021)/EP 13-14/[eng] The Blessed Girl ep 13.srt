<i>Episode 13</i>

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,030
Who is so bold

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,750
to dismantle my store?

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Brother!

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,710
Your brother?

28
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,710
Xiao!

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,120
Your brother looks strange.

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,120
Is he drunk?

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,280
My… My brother never drinks.

32
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,630
Your brother looks very strange.

33
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,960
Where did you get the materials

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,430
of the sword?

35
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,280
-Xiao!
-Watch out!

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:12,960
Sir!

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,910
Sir!

38
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,800
Sir!

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,630
Are you okay?

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,280
Yin Xiao,

41
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,280
are you crazy?

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,870
How could you

43
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,680
treat an elderly that way?

44
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
Just vent your anger on me…

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,590
I…

46
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,520
I…

47
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,800
I…

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,150
I feel very disappointed in you.

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,870
Got it?

50
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,310
You are not good at drinking.

51
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,030
Don’t drink secretly in the future.

52
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,030
It is inappropriate to drink so much.

53
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,280
Huotu Xin, are you okay?

54
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,910
Are you okay?

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,630
Go, let’s go.

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,430
Go.

57
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:19,920
Xiao!

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,830
What’s wrong with my brother?

59
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,720
He must have been enchanted.

60
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,430
Enchanted?

61
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,600
Do you have a cure?

62
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,920
Yes.

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,510
My cure is upstairs.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,430
Upstairs?

65
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,120
Upstairs?

66
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
I am afraid my umbrella can’t stand it.

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,560
What shall we do now?

68
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,430
Put on the bracelets.

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,270
Hurry up.

70
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,000
Both of you.

71
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,160
And then?

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,240
Touch them.

73
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,040
Touch.

74
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,000
Don’t hurt my brother.

75
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,000
How to use it?

76
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,430
Use water.

77
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,270
Water?

78
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,480
How… How to use it?

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,240
Water… How…

80
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,160
Xiao.

81
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,600
Yin…

82
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,070
Yin… Yin Zhuang.

83
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:25,950
Xiao.

84
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,160
My masterpiece!

85
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,800
An invaluable treasure indeed!

86
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,630
I…

87
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,750
Your Majesty, Minister Fei,

88
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,680
Zhu Xi’s people have entered Zhaodu.

89
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,120
Zhu Xi has only one hundred people,

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,920
but we have to dispatch

91
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
all our guards against them.

92
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,310
Is it too big a response on our part?

93
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,430
Even a lion has to do its best

94
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,630
to catch a rabbit.

95
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,480
Zhu Xi has arrived too quickly this time

96
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,040
and I am afraid he is ready for it.

97
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,920
Just take it easy.

98
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,240
You have made preparations for long.

99
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,160
Just do your best.

100
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,240
I will guard the imperial city for you.

101
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,680
After long-term preparations,

102
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,240
finally

103
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,000
they are all here.

104
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,510
Yuan Yi…

105
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
I think I have to leave first.

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,630
It’s okay.

107
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,240
What can I do for you?

108
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
It is said Zhu Xi has arrived.

109
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,920
The person who keeps chasing
you has shown up.

110
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,830
Are you scared?

111
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,190
I am not scared.

112
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,070
I must see

113
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,750
who he really is.

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,360
<i>Blacksmith</i>
It hurts so much.

115
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,560
It hurts so much.

116
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,680
What’s wrong?

117
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,310
I have no idea.

118
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,430
Let’s

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,870
have another try.

120
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,390
It hurts so much.

121
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,310
What shall we do now?

122
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,830
It is my dowry.

123
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,000
I suggest

124
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,030
having a rest first.

125
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,670
Take the medicine.

126
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,200
It can cure

127
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,870
your mesmerism.

128
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,000
Feel better?

129
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,910
I am sorry.

130
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,200
I almost wounded you

131
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,720
and smashed your store

132
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
in order to save Yin Zhuang.

133
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,840
It doesn’t matter.

134
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,080
Consider it a test for the bracelets.

135
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,150
Pingting is full of

136
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
different types of people.

137
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,440
Sir,

138
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,030
have you offended anyone?

139
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,670
I have no idea.

140
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,000
Thank you

141
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,150
for helping make the jewelry.

142
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,080
You are welcome.

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,390
Actually I should

144
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,910
say thank you to you instead.

145
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,150
I saw

146
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,550
the two valuable crystal stones

147
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,870
of your sister,

148
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,030
and I was afraid they were spoiled

149
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,870
by the mediocre craftsmen.

150
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,390
So I felt…

151
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,000
obliged to do it.

152
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,550
Forget it.

153
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,510
How do you think

154
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,320
about the pair of bracelets?

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,390
Your techniques

156
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
are really marvelous.

157
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
It is hard to find

158
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,440
another jewelry master like you

159
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,550
in Suchuan.

160
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,480
But why do you

161
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,960
live in reclusion here?

162
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,840
It is a long story.

163
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,550
It really hurts too much.

164
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,080
Why is that?

165
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,080
Don’t worry.

166
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,200
It can certainly be removed.

167
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Is it destiny?

168
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,600
It must be

169
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,030
destiny.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
God doesn’t wish you

171
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,750
to marry Weisheng Yan.

172
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,750
Your brother is coming.

173
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,360
We have to leave now.

174
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,720
Xiao,

175
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,550
are you okay?

176
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,270
But… My…

177
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,240
My bracelet…

178
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,790
Just leave it on his wrist first.

179
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,080
What?

180
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,600
After we arrive in Zhaodu,

181
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,600
I will cut off his hand

182
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,510
and get it for you.

183
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,320
Don’t worry.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,240
Your daughter can cure you.

185
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,360
You said

186
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,960
you would take me to Zhaodu?

187
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,670
It is said Zhu Xi

188
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,550
set out for Zhaodu yesterday.

189
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,630
Zhu Xi has never shown up in Zhaodu

190
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,720
since the emperor was crowned.

191
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,440
He must be looking for Linglong

192
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,720
in this trip.

193
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,360
Other than Zhu Xi,

194
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,080
I am afraid Weisheng Yan

195
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,480
is also on the way.

196
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,510
Do you mean

197
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,550
Weisheng Yan and Zhu Xi conspired?

198
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,840
Weisheng Yan

199
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,200
isn’t a simple person.

200
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,550
I am afraid what we encountered

201
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,390
in Pingting previously

202
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,030
has something to do with him,

203
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,270
including

204
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,080
your wedding.

205
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,870
Now,

206
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,270
I must keep myself separate

207
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,960
in order to see it clearly.

208
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,480
Yin Xiao,

209
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,390
do you mean

210
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,320
Zhu Xi has gone to Zhaodu?

211
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,600
If

212
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,600
your daughter is really the Goddess,

213
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,000
there isn’t any safe place

214
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,960
for your daughter

215
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,480
in Suchuan.

216
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,870
Do you have any latest news

217
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,030
about Linglong?

218
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
The Ritual of Eternity

219
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,150
will be held in Zhaodu soon.

220
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Ritual of Eternity?

221
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,750
What is Ritual of Eternity?

222
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,510
The ritual to apotheosize Linglong.

223
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,200
If she succeeds,

224
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,150
she will be the real Goddess.

225
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,630
If she fails,

226
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,750
she…

227
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,510
She will be killed as a monster

228
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,080
or a liar.

229
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,000
Kill the Goddess on the altar.

230
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,960
Nothing is more thrilling

231
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,840
than this.

232
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,080
Zhu Xi wants to

233
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,600
kill Linglong at the Ritual of Eternity.

234
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,840
Why?

235
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,120
A menace

236
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:53,790
or a token of authority?

237
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,240
I have no idea.

238
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
But it is his plan.

239
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,630
The Yuan family has been irreplaceable
in the past centuries

240
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,510
just for its role as god-picked king.

241
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,200
If Zhu Xi can kill the Goddess,

242
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,320
the base of the Yuan family
will be endangered.

243
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,750
In that case,

244
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,870
the Yuan family won’t be irreplaceable.

245
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,240
To kill the Goddess
at the Ritual of Eternity?

246
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,150
It is in Zhaodu!

247
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,720
Moreover,

248
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,440
if Linglong is really the goddess,

249
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,670
Zhu Xi won’t hurt her.

250
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Goddess or monster,

251
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,360
it is just their decision.

252
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,030
I will take you to see somebody.

253
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,840
Who is that?

254
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,840
Yin Zhuang,

255
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,870
let’s break

256
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,080
your engagement.

257
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
As you requested,

258
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,720
I told that lad about Jia’s daughter

259
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,910
being the monster

260
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,320
left by the plague seventeen years ago.

261
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,320
Sorry, Grandfather.

262
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,440
I made you worry again.

263
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,120
Tell me

264
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,270
if you have fallen in love with him.

265
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,510
Grandfather,

266
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,150
stop your nonsense.

267
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,240
You have refused

268
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,270
numerous wooers

269
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,320
these years.

270
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,000
I counted them in the beginning,

271
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,200
but it was beyond me in the end.

272
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,320
But

273
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
he is the only one

274
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,840
who gets close to us.

275
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,000
No kidding.

276
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,840
Girl,

277
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,150
I don’t know
why you got in touch with him.

278
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,960
It must

279
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,720
be something dangerous.

280
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,790
Keep an eye on him anyway.

281
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,750
Otherwise,

282
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,750
you may feel sorry in the future.

283
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,150
Grandfather.

284
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,750
Look, it is the punishment
for your nonsense.

285
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,720
His Majesty and Goddess have arrived.

286
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,670
Greetings, Your Majesty!

287
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,390
Spare it.

288
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,000
Thanks, Your Majesty!

289
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,910
What have you learned in Tianqi Sect

290
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,000
these days?

291
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,720
Your Majesty,

292
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,440
the followers of Tianqi Sect

293
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,910
guided us to read through Gods’ stories

294
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,790
and examine their historic collections.

295
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,480
It is a fruitful trip.

296
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,390
Not bad.

297
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,240
You can share with Marquis Pingjiang

298
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,320
what you have learned these days

299
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,270
after he arrives.

300
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,360
I don’t expect him to miss it
due to late arrival.

301
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,150
Report!

302
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,030
Your Majesty!

303
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,080
Marquis Pingjiang asks for a meeting.

304
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,390
Summon!

305
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,030
Sorry for my late arrival
to protect Your Majesty!

306
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,630
Please pardon me, Your Majesty.

307
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,630
Zhu Xi,

308
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,870
there is no assassinator here.

309
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,960
You don’t have to protect me.

310
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,600
Frankly,

311
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,120
the so-called Goddess beside you

312
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,870
is actually a liar.

313
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,200
The magic displayed during the burial of

314
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,120
Fozhuan is just her trick to cheat you.

315
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,360
I have guarded you secretly all the way

316
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,360
from Fire Tribe to Zhaodu.

317
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,400
I attempted to kill the liar for times,

318
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
but she managed to escape.

319
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,640
Marquis Pingjiang,

320
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,350
do you know what you are saying?

321
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,270
Your Majesty,

322
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,750
please check the article she used

323
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,880
to disguise herself as the Goddess.

324
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,720
It is nothing more than a kid’s toy

325
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,680
in Pingting.

326
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,400
Are you justified to claim me

327
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
a fake goddess with this small article?

328
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,720
Isn’t it too naive?

329
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,030
Take her here.

330
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,030
Xia Ling?

331
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,480
Linglong.

332
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,590
I have personally visited Fire Tribe

333
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,000
to inquire about her history

334
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,790
and brought here

335
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,960
a villager who witnessed her killings.

336
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,400
Your Majesty,

337
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
she is not only a liar,

338
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,160
but also a cruel monster.

339
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,750
Fire Tribe is blocked.

340
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,590
The people there haven’t
heard about stories of the Goddess.

341
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,550
It is normal for the tribesmen

342
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,960
to take the Goddess

343
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,960
as a monster when she woke up.

344
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,310
Even if the Fire Tribe didn’t know
about the Goddess,

345
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,590
they must be able to

346
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,680
differentiate a Goddess and a monster.

347
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,350
Only a monster

348
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,440
kills innocent people.

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,160
I didn’t kill any innocent people.

350
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,750
All tribesmen

351
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,350
know she is a monster.

352
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,480
They didn’t drive her
out of the village

353
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,270
as they felt sorry for her father.

354
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:13,880
Enough.

355
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,750
Shut up.

356
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,510
I have never hurt you.

357
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,030
Why did you say that?

358
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,160
Your Majesty,

359
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,480
I have numerous evidence to prove

360
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,960
she is

361
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,680
an inexcusable monster.

362
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,440
What evidence do you have

363
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,680
to prove yourself?

364
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,640
I am not a monster.

365
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
Don’t kill me. Don’t kill me.

366
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,240
I don’t need any evidence.

367
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,200
I am the Goddess.

368
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,790
If you don’t believe it,

369
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,310
let’s have a try.

370
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,960
Poke your sword into my chest.

371
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,350
If I am hurt by an earthly weapon

372
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,070
and shed a single drop of blood,

373
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,720
I will be the fake one,

374
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,830
and you can

375
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,440
kill me before His Majesty.

376
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,510
If you can’t hurt me,

377
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,200
you will be the sinner

378
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,160
who despises the Goddess,

379
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,920
and I will penetrate your throat
with the sword

380
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:24,960
and hang your head

381
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,070
high on the city walls

382
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,880
as a warning to all.

383
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,000
Your fiefs will be returned
to His Majesty,

384
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,720
and your people

385
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,550
will take you as a shame.

386
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,510
How is it?

387
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,350
Marquis Pingjiang,

388
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,480
let’s have a try.

389
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,030
Nonsense!

390
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,030
You are just a liar.

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,440
You aren’t qualified to bet with me.

393
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,640
Zhu Xi,

394
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,720
your reluctance to bet with the Goddess

395
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,830
proves that

396
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,000
you aren’t sure
if the Goddess is true or fake.

397
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,440
Why did you

398
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,830
defame the Goddess just now?

399
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,880
Calm down, Your Majesty.

400
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,030
It is not my reluctance.

401
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,720
It is unnecessary indeed.

402
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,550
Look, Your Majesty.

403
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,110
Anybody?

404
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,750
Anybody?

405
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,440
Crap.

406
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,920
It is too late.

407
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,960
It seems she has been taken away.

408
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,310
Where is she now?

409
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,790
The girl is the only clue and evidence

410
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,510
of the plague in Pingting.

411
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,790
Jia hid her for seventeen years

412
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,830
and she has been taken as a monster,

413
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,480
suffering
unlimited humiliations and tortures.

414
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,440
It must be Zhu Xi

415
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,240
who has taken her away.

416
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
If the plague in Pingting

417
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,070
seventeen years ago was manmade

418
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,640
just to cover up

419
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
a more horrible truth,

420
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,640
Jia’s daughter must be

421
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,680
a monster created by the plague.

422
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,550
If…

423
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,310
If she has been taken to Zhaodu...

424
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,240
Linglong

425
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,160
will be in danger.

426
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,350
Let go of me.

427
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,550
Do you feel surprised, too?

428
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,070
You should feel pleasant.

429
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,920
What do you mean?

430
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,200
What on earth is this?

431
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
Your Majesty,

432
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,510
the plague in Pingting

433
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,350
seventeen years ago was caused

434
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,070
by the monsters.

435
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,110
They turned Pingting

436
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,640
into a dead city

437
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,960
and caused numerous people

438
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,070
homeless.

439
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,160
This person

440
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
and her mother

441
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,640
are one of those monsters

442
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,160
who survived my hunting.

443
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,030
Your Majesty,

444
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,310
if you continue to

445
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,440
cover up for these monsters,

446
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,270
they will bring the plague again

447
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,070
and revive the disaster 17 years ago.

448
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,830
The imperial city

449
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,550
and even the whole Suchuan

450
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,550
will suffer great famines

451
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,880
with starving people

452
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,070
and corpses all around.

453
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,310
Today,

454
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,880
I must absolutely kill her

455
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,720
for the good of our people.

456
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,790
It is already in the past.

457
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,160
We should make a thorough
investigation before any conclusion.

458
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,830
Don’t kill me.

459
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,790
You know my mother.

460
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,510
Don’t kill me.

461
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,550
I am not a monster.

462
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,350
Don’t kill me.

463
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,960
I am not a monster.

464
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,350
Father, save me.

465
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,440
Father.

466
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,030
Your Majesty!

467
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,030
Please be sure to kill this monster

468
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,350
in order to save Suchuan’s people.

469
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,160
My mother isn’t a monster.

470
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,880
Monster is dangerous.

471
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,830
Protect His Majesty!

472
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,750
Guards of Immortal Blood,
protect His Majesty!

473
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,030
Stop!

474
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,110
Catch her.

475
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:50,920
Aye.

476
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,030
Please.

477
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,440
My goodness!

478
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,240
Look at the face of that person.

479
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,070
She is too ugly.

480
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,070
What is that?

481
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,160
I am not a monster.

482
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,790
Don’t kill me.

483
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,550
Don’t kill me.

484
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,350
Too scary.

485
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,550
-I am not a monster.
-Let’s go.

486
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,110
I am not a monster.

487
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,680
Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!

488
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,270
Fei Tian.

489
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,110
Release her.

490
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,400
It is easy for me to release her.

491
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,160
Will Zhu Xi release her?

492
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,070
I will let Zhu Xi know

493
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,350
it is impossible for him

494
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,070
to harm Linglong in Zhaodu.

495
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,160
Zhu Xi didn’t dare to take actions

496
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,790
due to lack of justification before.

497
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,750
But you’re protecting

498
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,400
a well-known monster now.

499
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,680
Once Zhu Xi takes it as an excuse

500
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,440
to attack Zhaodu,

501
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,240
how will you respond,

502
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,310
Your Majesty?

503
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Linglong isn’t a monster.

504
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,640
I will find the truth.

505
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,680
If Zhu Xi dares to attack Zhaodu,

506
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,160
we will be justified for a crusade.

507
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,640
Do you want to fight back?

508
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,030
Do you want to

509
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,720
protect the Goddess with the fleshes

510
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,720
of your people and soldiers?

511
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,240
Your Majesty!

512
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,240
Have you forgotten your

513
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
original purpose to find the Goddess?

514
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,400
I will protect the people of Zhaodu.

515
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,000
I won’t abandon Linglong, either.

516
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,590
I will stop whoever

517
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,920
wants to kill her.

518
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,590
Zhaodu is besieged by Shixu.

519
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,400
We need to take a detour.

520
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,270
It is expected

521
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,920
to take us more time.

522
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,070
What on earth is Shixu?

523
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,720
An enormous abyss

524
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,510
that is a shield to guard

525
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,070
and isolate Zhaodu.

526
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,830
But it takes only one day

527
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,680
by Weisheng Yan’s fish boat.

528
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,270
Then let’s use

529
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,270
Weisheng Yan’s fish boat.

530
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,830
Yin Zhuang,

531
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,310
where did you go last night?

532
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:32,920
Weisheng Yan,

533
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,480
we won’t go back.

534
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,480
Your engagement with Yin Zhuang

535
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,400
is hereby canceled.

536
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,030
You have no relation with each other

537
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,270
from now on.

538
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,030
Our wedding is already known

539
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,550
by most people of Suchuan

540
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,110
and all the big clans are expecting it.

541
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,160
Your cancellation of the engagement

542
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,510
will undermine the Yin’s reputation.

543
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,590
Moreover,

544
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,720
your stay at my mansion

545
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,790
is also widely known.

546
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,480
If you leave now,

547
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,830
how will you be viewed by others?

548
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,270
Weisheng Yan,

549
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,000
she just doesn’t want to marry you.

550
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,590
Do you think

551
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,720
it is meaningful

552
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,680
to talk about nonsense?

553
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,790
Just be a man

554
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,270
and let her go.

555
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,200
Yin Zhuang is my fiancée,

556
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,920
and it has nothing to do with you.

557
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,440
It has

558
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
something to do with me.

559
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,160
Look here.

560
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,440
This is a pair of Yin Yang Bracelets

561
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,720
made of the Yin’s heirloom.

562
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,750
Yin Zhuang

563
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,030
is my girl now.

564
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,880
Do you know

565
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,680
what fate really means?

566
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,680
Regardless of your wealth,

567
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,680
Yin Zhuang

568
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
is mine.

569
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,960
Yin Zhuang!

570
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,510
A trade

571
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,510
will be completed one day.

572
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,590
What if I use force to keep you here?

573
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,550
You can’t.

574
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,680
It is alleged to protect true love.

575
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,400
I will show you

576
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,590
the real meaning of an inborn couple.

577
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,270
Incredible!

578
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,270
This is

579
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,510
really invaluable.

580
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,240
This is the power

581
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,680
that guards love.

582
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,790
If you don’t explain,

583
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,960
it will look more marvelous.

584
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,240
Weisheng Yan,

585
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,920
that is the end of it.

586
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,030
You can leave.

587
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,350
I will remember you.

588
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,240
Weisheng Yan,

589
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,000
wait a minute.

590
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,510
I… I want to borrow something from you.

591
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,310
Don’t go too far.

592
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,240
Bullshit!

593
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,920
You almost killed me twice.

594
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,830
It is not too much

595
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,160
for me to ask something from you.

596
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,680
Do you want to borrow my boat
for Zhaodu?

597
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,110
It is too late.

598
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,400
What? What do you mean?

599
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,270
Marquis Pingjiang
has borrowed all my boats

600
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,110
and left not even a single one for me.

601
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,030
What?

602
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,550
Zhu Xi borrowed fish boats?

603
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,270
He wants

604
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,920
to launch a sneak attack on Zhaodu.

605
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,590
Linglong…

606
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,000
Chief Priest, aren’t you afraid of

607
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,790
being mistaken as my partner

608
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,030
by asking me to your divine palace

609
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,270
in public?

610
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,030
Zhu Xi,

611
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
listen.

612
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,030
Never harm the Goddess.

613
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,920
Are you too old

614
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,880
or have you gone blind and deaf?

615
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,150
It is Fei Tian instead of me

616
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,510
who wants to harm the Goddess.

617
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,920
Your enemy is Fei Tian.

618
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,480
Fei Tian has established

619
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,400
an execution ground for your Goddess.

620
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,840
If you want to save her,

621
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,880
just go to Fei Tian.

622
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,110
It is senseless

623
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,840
to come to me for it.

624
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,840
It is all

625
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
because of you.

626
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,920
Listen.

627
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,360
I don’t mean

628
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,190
today.

629
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,710
It is

630
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,360
all about seventeen years ago.

631
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,510
It seems you

632
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,630
know much about it.

633
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,320
Why don’t you tell the truth?

634
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,150
Is it because you can’t say

635
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,000
or you don’t want to say?

636
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,760
Maybe

637
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,150
they are all waiting for you to speak.

638
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,440
Whether she is the Goddess or a monster

639
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,550
will be proven
on the execution ground.

640
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,150
If she can prove herself as the Goddess,

641
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,880
I promise

642
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,800
I will certainly be her subject.

643
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,150
Will Fei Tian

644
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,000
do the same?

645
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,070
Zhu Xi,

646
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,150
what on earth are you going to do?

647
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,710
How come you don’t realize it?

648
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,840
I am a loyal official, right?

649
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,400
How can I tolerate His Majesty

650
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,360
being fooled by a monster?

651
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,880
I want

652
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,480
to clear

653
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,590
the evil people

654
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,440
beside His Majesty.

655
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,710
Take care.

656
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:26,630
Okay.

657
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,960
Weisheng Yan didn’t cheat us this time.

658
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,070
Why are you laughing?

659
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,630
It is really a good play

660
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,230
just now.

661
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,030
I did it

662
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,320
just to convince him.

663
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,630
I take back what I said yesterday.

664
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,710
What?

665
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,840
You did

666
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,230
know something.

667
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,670
Okay,

668
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,760
we have no time to waste.

669
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,320
We must get the boats right away.

670
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,320
Well…

671
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,280
Is what Weisheng Yan said
about the boats

672
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,110
credible?

673
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,590
Whether it is credible or not,

674
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,190
we must break

675
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,110
Zhu Xi’s troops firstly.

676
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,440
I have an idea.

677
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,760
I will use this to guide the fires here

678
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,280
and keep it on fire

679
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,400
to drive all of them away.

680
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,190
Come on.

681
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,030
What’s up?

682
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,800
Why doesn’t it work?

683
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,960
Mr. Wu Yan said

684
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,360
the two bracelets needed

685
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,960
to accumulate powers

686
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,760
for some time after use.

687
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,480
It seems

688
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,440
they haven’t recovered.

689
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,760
Well… I didn’t expect such a time limit.

690
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,800
Don’t think you can guard true love

691
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,280
just by using physical materials.

692
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,760
Let’s go.

693
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,800
Just follow me.

694
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,840
My brother’s power

695
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,000
has no time limit.

696
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,710
Let’s go.

697
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,190
No, no. There are so many people here.

698
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,000
Who is that?

699
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,070
Get away.

700
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,400
No admission here.

701
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,230
I am rushing against time

702
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,710
and won’t show mercy.

703
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,000
I hope you know it.

704
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,030
You won’t escape!

705
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,320
Hurry up.

706
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,030
Close your eyes.

707
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,030
Xiao.

708
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,070
Leave someone to row the boat.

709
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:48,840
Go.

710
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,230
Go and row the boat.

711
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,280
Wu Yuan?

712
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,110
You are too late.

713
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,590
I have been waiting for long.

714
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,320
Escaping with other's wife?

715
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,400
What’s up?

716
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,070
Your Highness!

717
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,590
You are not needed here.

718
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,110
Be dismissed.

719
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,190
Wait.

720
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,150
I almost forgot it.

721
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,030
Please give it to Weisheng Yan.

722
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:34,920
Thanks.

I have brought you
the pork cake I made myself.

728
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,710
Only after leaving Fire Tribe

729
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,150
did you find

730
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,230
pork cake was unique to our tribe.

731
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:21,880
Thanks.

732
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,510
Despite our frequent quarrels before,

733
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,630
we have grown up together.

734
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,480
If there were afterlife,

735
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,230
don’t be a monster.

736
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,400
Afterlife?

737
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,360
Why did you help Zhu Xi?

738
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,000
I can’t allow you to harm our tribesmen

739
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,030
and more innocent people.

740
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,230
Yes.

741
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,510
To you,

742
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,840
I am just a monster

743
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,110
whose coughing

744
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,190
will spread plagues now.

745
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,800
Not even the prison guard

746
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,880
dares to deliver foods to me,

747
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,190
let alone you.

748
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,030
Just help yourself.

749
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,230
I…

750
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:25,960
I am leaving now.

751
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,630
Zhu Xi

752
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,510
really has

753
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,670
spent much on me.

754
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,030
Weisheng Yan never fails to revenge.

755
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,150
He won’t let you go away easily

756
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,590
as you have taken away his wife.

757
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,840
I haven’t lived a better life anyway.

758
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,510
Why are you here?

759
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,550
According to Marquis Pingjiang’s order,

760
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,230
I need to go to Zhaodu

761
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,920
and kill your daughter.

762
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,070
Linglong

763
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,190
is just a tool of Zhu Xi

764
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,070
to replace Yuan Yi,

765
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:31,440
right?

766
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,150
Why?

767
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,880
Linglong and her mother

768
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,960
are just different from others.

769
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,630
I don’t believe in Goddess

770
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,400
and they aren’t monsters.

771
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,280
They are just different from others.

772
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,440
Why are they treated in this way?

773
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,510
Zhaodu

774
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,960
honors Linglong as its Goddess

775
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,000
just to re-establish

776
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,320
the ruling authority of the Yuan family.

777
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,880
Zhu Xi wants to kill Linglong

778
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,590
just to replace Yuan Yi.

779
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,190
Goddess

780
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,150
is already a legend

781
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,400
dating back to five hundred years ago.

782
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,150
Your daughter

783
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,590
must be eliminated

784
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,630
before he can replace the Yuan family.

785
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,800
So

786
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,880
the plague in Pingting 17 years ago

787
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,880
is just a fraud

788
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,440
created by Zhu Xi

789
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,400
to slaughter all aliens like her,

790
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,400
isn’t it?

791
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,760
Your Jin’er is possibly

792
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,360
the only person who survived.

793
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,360
Jia’s daughter

794
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,320
has been taken by Zhu Xi to Zhaodu.

795
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,150
She is different from
Linglong and Jin’er.

796
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,800
But she is also taken as a monster.

797
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,710
Jia has hidden her for 17 years.

798
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,670
Why was she

799
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,800
discovered by Zhu Xi this time?

800
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,550
Is it because of me?

801
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,480
Who

802
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
has been tracking me?

803
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,070
Is that you?

804
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,880
Don’t disembark at Zhaodu.

805
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:42,920
Otherwise,

806
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,710
I will kill you.

807
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:51,400
