<i>Episode 14</i>

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,360
Is that woman

25
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,750
Zhu Xi’s people?

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:27,630
Yes.

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,520
Reliable?

28
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,280
Isn’t this boat

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,310
prepared by Weisheng Yan?

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,430
Yin Zhuang’s bracelets

31
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,710
were made by her grandfather.

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
They both

33
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,560
taught me the same thing.

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,310
In Pingting,

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
nobody is reliable.

36
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,590
It is really ridiculous.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
Although you helped her get away,

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,750
her reputation was tainted by you.

39
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,080
You should

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,520
take responsibility for it.

41
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,520
Yin Zhuang is an innocent girl.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,150
You must explain clearly

43
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,750
what happened last night.

44
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,150
I… I…

45
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,910
Otherwise,

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,960
I will punish you.

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,560
Yin Zhuang!

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,680
Xiao, look here.

49
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,710
These are peppers grown
on Bright Moon Island

50
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,800
and these

51
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,000
are all specialties from there.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
What are you doing in the kitchen?

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,750
Cooking.

54
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,870
Cooking?

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
We will certainly have a hard battle

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
on the trip to Zhaodu.

57
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,280
How can we win if we are hungry?

58
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,680
I really feel so happy

59
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,910
to see you like this.

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,430
I know.

61
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,150
If I did marry Weisheng Yan,

62
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,360
do you want to kill him?

63
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,590
Doesn’t he deserve it?

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,960
Who knows?

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,840
It has nothing to do with me.

66
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,680
But I have never believed

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
you would marry Weisheng Yan.

68
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,920
Am I not a good actor?

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,070
No.

70
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,630
Yin Zhuang,

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,430
promise me.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,270
Never do anything

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
not good for yourself in the future.

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,750
Just be yourself.

75
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,270
Okay, Xiao,

76
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,630
I am not such a good girl

77
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,310
as you imagine.

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,190
I just wanted to marry a rich person

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
and help you out.

80
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
It is not a big trouble for me indeed.

81
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,040
Promise me.

82
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,480
I have never felt sorry

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,270
for marrying Weisheng Yan.

84
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,630
Without a try,

85
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,560
I may feel sorry in the future.

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,430
I may wonder why I hadn’t

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
tried my best

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,270
to help my brother realize his dreams?

89
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,430
We would live on

90
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,480
Bright Moon Island for our life.

91
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,480
The coming back of the Goddess

92
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,000
is just another new message

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,270
brought by a traveler.

94
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,630
We can’t even

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,480
distinguish if Zhu Xi’s killing of God

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,510
is true or false.

97
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,390
We won’t go to Zhaodu and

98
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,750
guard the Goddess and His Majesty

99
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,390
as what we are doing now.

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,120
So

101
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,680
I have just followed my heart

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,920
to marry Weisheng Yan.

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,680
I’m also following my heart
to leave him.

104
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,920
I will never feel sorry

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
for my choices.

106
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,830
So I won’t feel sad.

107
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,920
Aren’t you the same kind of person?

108
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,190
To others,

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
it looks so ridiculous that

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,870
you have given up

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,240
your empery of Pingting

112
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,430
and gone to Zhaodu to guard

113
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,920
a declining king.

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
But I know

115
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,480
it is a supreme honor

116
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,190
for you.

117
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,950
My sister

118
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,800
has grown up.

119
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,560
You know it

120
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,160
even better than I do.

121
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,950
Without such an excellent brother,

122
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,920
I can’t feel so free
to do whatever I like.

123
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,310
Yin Zhuang,

124
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,120
what happened

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,270
last night?

126
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,630
Nothing special.

127
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,630
What do you think happened then?

128
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,310
I will support you

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
whatever you do in the future.

130
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,830
Maybe…

131
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,190
I think…

132
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,040
What do you think?

133
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,480
Nothing.

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,310
Let’s talk about it in the future.

135
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,510
Linglong,

136
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,360
are you a monster

137
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,120
or the Goddess?

138
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,680
It is really a pity

139
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,720
that I haven’t shown

140
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,390
this beautiful dress to my father.

141
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,510
Where are you going?

142
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,440
Zhaodu.

143
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,440
We are visiting His Majesty.

144
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,790
Do you have any imperial edict?

145
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,000
No.

146
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,320
Without an imperial edict,

147
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,510
you won’t be admitted.

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,720
Please go back.

149
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,670
I am the Goddess’s father.

150
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,000
Zhu Xi wants to kill my daughter

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,790
and attack Zhaodu.

152
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,750
What else do you have to say?

153
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,030
Today,

154
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,030
another person disguised as the Goddess

155
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,630
will be decapitated.

156
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,000
I have kept in mind

157
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,480
the looks

158
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,910
and also the names

159
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,120
of half the people here.

160
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,510
Two days ago,

161
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,120
you took me as your Goddess

162
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,080
and paid tribute to me wherever I was.

163
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,510
Why are you lowering your heads?

164
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,750
Don’t feel ashamed.

165
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,480
You should feel proud instead.

166
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
You will decapitate a monster

167
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,720
who has brought disasters
to the state and the people.

168
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,360
You are all witnesses,

169
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,790
and the heroes of Suchuan.

170
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,200
Moreover,

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,720
the person there,

172
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
Marquis Pingjiang!

173
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,750
People say you have

174
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,480
the greatest military power

175
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,720
and the richest fief in Suchuan.

176
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,510
But to me,

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,200
you are just rubbish.

178
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,200
You want to kill me

179
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
because you are afraid of me.

180
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,440
How much do you fear me?

181
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,030
Am I still a big threat to you

182
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,440
even if I am at the edge of death now?

183
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,360
How dare you say that!

184
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,200
Finally,

185
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,240
I want to blame the Goddess.

186
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,510
You aren’t a monster.

187
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,630
You are just a joke.

188
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,510
If you all claim

189
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,440
to kill the monster,

190
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,960
I will satisfy your wish.

191
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,440
Kill me

192
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,670
and terminate this farce.

193
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,390
Come on.

194
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,200
Report!

195
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:33,910
What’s up?

196
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,030
Have you got it?

197
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,000
Chief Priest,

198
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,870
thank you for helping me

199
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,240
and trusting me.

200
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,870
I just can’t help you complete

201
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,840
the Ritual of Eternity.

202
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,200
I am really sorry.

203
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:04,910
Stop it!

204
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,200
What do you have to say?

205
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,550
Fei Tian!

206
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,670
Do you know

207
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,480
what you are doing now?

208
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,270
I am decapitating a liar.

209
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you oppose it?

210
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,270
I will prove

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,910
if she is real or fake

212
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,630
at the Ritual of Eternity.

213
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,750
If she

214
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,750
is a fake one,

215
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
she will be at your disposal then.

216
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,270
I won’t oppose it anymore.

217
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,150
Since the very beginning, I have felt

218
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,080
she is a liar.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
Moreover, Marquis Pingjiang

220
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,120
has shown the best evidence,

221
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,390
but she can’t prove herself.

222
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,510
Chief Priest,

223
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,390
tell me your justification

224
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,360
to hold

225
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,630
the Ritual of Eternity.

226
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,600
Fei Tian,

227
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,720
you are utterly wrong!

228
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,670
For Suchuan and His Majesty,

229
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,390
I’m willing

230
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,910
to bear all responsibilities.

231
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,030
Stop!

232
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,480
Zhu Xi,

233
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,390
she isn’t a monster.

234
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,840
I will make a thorough investigation

235
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,960
into the causes of the plague

236
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,480
seventeen years ago

237
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,840
and provide an explanation to you all.

238
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,150
But never do anything

239
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,720
before that.

240
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,600
Your Majesty.

241
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,240
If you still need further evidence,

242
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,480
just come back to Pingting with me

243
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,360
and see the troubles of people

244
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,200
left by the monster then.

245
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,360
Okay?

246
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,480
Zhu Xi,

247
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
do you remember this?

248
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,360
You are really a young talent.

249
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,270
Not even I have discovered

250
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,510
your good trick.

251
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,270
I didn’t expect

252
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,080
the closest mentor of my son

253
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,840
was your people.

254
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,600
Me too.

255
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,000
I didn’t expect

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,720
you could find the survived monsters

257
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,790
seventeen years ago.

258
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,790
Let’s get straight to the point.

259
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
Is my son okay?

260
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,720
You will know it

261
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,870
when you return to Pingting

262
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,870
after the Ritual of Eternity.

263
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,480
You and Fei Tian

264
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,510
have planned it for the monster

265
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,750
in the past eight years.

266
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,320
Do you think it is worthwhile?

267
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,270
You know

268
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,160
she isn’t a monster.

269
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,830
But Suchuan doesn’t know it.

270
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,790
If Your Majesty
already has an arrangement,

271
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,160
I will

272
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,400
leave first.

273
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,310
Your Majesty,

274
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,070
I think

275
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,200
if her identity

276
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,510
is still in doubt,

277
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,270
why not allow her to prove herself

278
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,920
and clear the doubts of all?

279
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,680
Linglong,

280
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,590
whatever may come out,

281
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,270
you will always have my thanks.

282
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,720
Linglong!

283
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,510
Wu Yuan,

284
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,750
set sail.

285
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,590
There are Moon Guards here.

286
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,200
Rush over.

287
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,310
Pillar of Eternity.

288
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,680
The Pillar of Eternity is illuminated!

289
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,480
Please forgive me, Goddess!

290
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,240
Please forgive me, Goddess!

291
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:26,590
Please forgive me, Goddess!

292
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,790
Do you see it?

293
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,030
Kneel down!

294
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,240
Your Majesty!

295
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,510
I

296
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,070
am guilty!

297
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,440
This…

298
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,830
Is the punishment of the Goddess!

299
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,000
Zhu Xi has committed

300
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,110
a severe crime

301
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,680
by calumniating the Goddess.

302
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,590
Your kind lenience is anticipated!

303
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,720
Your Majesty!

304
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,920
Shall we

305
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,640
forgive him?

306
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,400
No.

307
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,160
No.

Goddess has arrived!

Universal celebration!

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,590
Welcome, Goddess!

Welcome, Goddess!

Congratulations on Your Majesty!

Welcome, Goddess!

Congratulations on Your Majesty!

330
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,440
Linglong,

331
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,440
you’ve succeeded!

332
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,880
I have seen it.

333
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,240
-I…
-Don’t show off hastily.

334
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Drink it up first

335
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,480
to replenish yourself.

336
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,400
Did I look very cool just now?

337
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,920
Were they

338
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,200
impressed by my power?

339
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,680
I’m starving.

340
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,680
Answer my question.

341
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,310
Did I look very cool?

342
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,030
You still remember it?

343
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,680
Yes.

344
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,160
When I transformed

345
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,310
last time,

346
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,590
I felt as if I had lost my memory.

347
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,070
But I remembered it clearly

348
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,350
this time.

349
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,750
It shows that

350
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,310
you are already the Goddess.

351
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,920
But

352
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,030
I must still blame you.

353
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,920
Fei Tian already

354
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,590
told me your plan.

355
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,200
I don’t think it is appropriate

356
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,400
to make such a big fuss

357
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,030
just to force the Chief Priest

358
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,240
to tell the truth.

359
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,830
Previously

360
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,510
we already discovered that

361
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,240
the Tianqi followers dispatched

362
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,160
to Fire Tribe had died successively.

363
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,640
Zhu Xi further

364
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,790
revealed the Pingting monster

365
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,720
seventeen years ago.

366
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,350
All the doubts are oriented

367
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,240
to what happened seventeen years ago.

368
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,480
The Chief Priest

369
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
must know something

370
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,400
that he hesitates to say.

371
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,920
But you even kept it a secret to me.

372
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,200
Tell you?

373
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,270
You almost spoiled it up

374
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,400
even if I hadn’t told you.

375
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,550
The Chief Priest was about
to tell the truth,

376
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,720
but you persuaded Zhu Xi to retreat.

377
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,750
Tell me.

378
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,480
How did you force Zhu Xi to retreat?

379
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,830
It isn’t important.

380
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,550
Answer me.

381
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,830
Is it within your plan

382
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,200
that Fei Tian let the guillotine fall?

383
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Fei Tian...

384
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,110
She

385
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,310
really wanted to kill me.

386
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,200
Crazy!

387
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,270
How dare

388
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:32,880
you risk your life that way?

389

507

But the Goddess

516
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,070

517
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,590
Linglong is just a carrier

518

519
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,640

523
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,160
It is my fault.

524
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,200

your increasing love for Linglong,

530

532
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,790
Linglong already said you had secrets,

533
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,160

554
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,360

557

559
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,070
His Majesty has preferred

560

561
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,190

563
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,480

564
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,760
Maybe you can

567
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,480
My dream

568

570
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,400

the battle for empery

573
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,590

576

were forced to hide and rest

584
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,480
at the most perilous cliff

585
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
to avoid hunting.

586
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,630
They couldn’t escape disasters

587
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,400
from time to time.

588
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,150
Civilization is progressing

589
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,190
and conquest replaces massacre.

590
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,230
The wings that can fly over ravines

591
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,760
and convey messages are better

592
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,230
than the ornaments on the wall.

593
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,920
Later on,

594
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,840
the Moon Tribe was gradually used

595
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,070
as the messenger

596
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,070
and left the cliff.

597
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,590
Therefore,

598
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,760
the Moon Tribe got out of miseries.

599
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,760
No.

600
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,360
Although we became the messenger,

601
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,230
we didn’t gain an equal footing

602
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,590
with the human beings.

603
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,510
The human beings mounted

604
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,230
a special iron ring on our wings.

605
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,190
We could still fly.

606
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,070
But we would feel

607
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
extreme pains

608
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,360
at each flip of wings.

609
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,960
Only when we were back

610
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,960
beside our master

611
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,000
would the master remove the ring

612
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,190
to give us a momentary break.

613
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,840
At that time,

614
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,110
the Moon Tribe just changed

615
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,960
from being the prey

616
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,480
into slaves.

617
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,510
Generations of the Moon Tribe

618
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,840
were born into this world.

619
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,510
But they were shackled

620
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,510
from the time of birth.

621
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,110
His Majesty was crowned at nine

622
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,800
and he is the last blood

623
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
of the Yuan family.

624
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,110
But His Majesty

625
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,710
released the first edict

626
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,400
to award the Moon Tribe

627
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,480
with the same status as all others

628
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,510
in Suchuan

629
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,000
despite all objections.

630
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,400
People of the Moon Tribe

631
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,190
were no longer slaves.

632
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,800
Only with His Majesty’s support

633
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,920
can the Moon Tribe

634
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,670
live in Suchuan with real freedom.

635
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,550
After the war,

636
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,440
His Majesty appointed me
as the prime minister

637
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,360
and Suchuan

638
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,360
had someone of the Moon Tribe as
the prime minister for the first time.

639
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,190
Goddess,

640
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,710
the Moon Tribe has never
believed in god.

641
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,960
The Moon Tribe only owes

642
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,590
to the royal family

643
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,190
or the Yuan family.

644
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,590
I didn’t expect

645
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,590
Yuan Yi to be so smart

646
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,920
at the age of eleven.

647
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,360
Sorry,

648
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,800
I have

649
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,190
misunderstood you.

650
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,070
No,

651
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,280
I have misunderstood you instead.

652
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,030
Report.

653
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,030
Goddess.

654
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,670
Minister Fei.

655
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,920
The Moon Guards intercepted

656
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,000
a fish boat breaking into Zhaodu

657
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,000
and caught two men and two women.

658
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,920
One of them

659
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,070
claimed to be the Goddess’s father.

660
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,480
My father has come!

661
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,630
Where is he?

662
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I didn’t dare to take him here
without approval

663
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,550
and he is currently
kept by the Moon Guards.

664
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,800
Take me there now.

665
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,760
Beware of fraud.

666
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,030
I will go and check first.

667
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,480
Your Highness!

668
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,670
It is ready now.

669
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,920
Have Pingting’s fish boats set sail?

670
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes.

671
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,150
The girl is mature now.

672
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,800
We can’t wait any longer.

673
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,070
But…

674
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,440
She is the real Goddess.

675
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,000
Are you sure to kill her?

676
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,230
Weisheng Yan said this sword was made

677
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,360
by the Fire Tribe with Earth Fire

678
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,440
five hundred years ago.

679
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,320
Do you know

680
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,070
how many monster heads I have

681
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,590
cut off with it seventeen years ago?

682
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,880
Great power, Your Highness!

683
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Tonight,

684
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,880
I will allow it to suck

685
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,150
the blood of the Goddess again.

686
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,880
What a big pair of wings!

687
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,110
You must be the manager here.

688
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,480
Where is Linglong?

689
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,110
Where is she?

690
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
Are you the father of Linglong?

691
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,150
I am her father.

692
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,030
My name is Huotu Xin.

693
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,320
The Yins?

694
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
Yin Xiao, Yin Zhuang?

695
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,510
You must be Minister Fei.

696
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,280
Minister Fei?

697
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,840
His Majesty talked about you.

698
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,030
Who are you?

699
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,000
I am a nobody.

700
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,150
I am just a boatwoman.

701
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,670
Madam,

702
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,320
just forget her.

703
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,280
It doesn’t matter who she is.

704
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,400
Madam,

705
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,760
are you the manager here?

706
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,590
I have something very important
to tell you.

707
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,510
Listen,

708
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,030
Linglong is in great danger.

709
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,190
Don’t lock me up here.

710
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,670
Allow me to meet her now.

711
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,190
I was just notified

712
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,360
somebody claimed
to be the father of the goddess.

713
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,510
I was worried it was a fraud.

714
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,230
But you look like the real one.

715
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,480
No fraud, no fraud.

716
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,280
Just take it easy.

717
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,360
Your daughter is very safe.

718
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,480
She is

719
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,030
the Goddess of the whole Suchuan now.

720
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,920
She is in danger

721
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,760
only because she is the Goddess.

722
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,840
Goddess!

723
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,800
Has Minister Fei returned?

724
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,760
Not yet.

725
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,800
This is comfort tea delivered here

726
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,920
at the order of His Majesty.

727
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,670
You performed magic just now

728
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
and it can help you replenish energies.

729
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,110
Where is His Majesty?

730
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,400
He seems to be with the Chief Priest.

731
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,000
Don’t worry, Goddess.

732
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,440
Drink the tea first

733
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,590
and replenish your energies.

734
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,190
Zhu Xi wants

735
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,280
to kill Linglong

736
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,070
after she is apotheosized.

737
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,110
Did you hear about it in jail?

738
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,670
He told me personally.

739
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,440
How did you escape

740
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,190
from the jail of Zhu Xi?

741
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,710
I…

742
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Somebody rescued me.

743
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,400
It is incredible that

744
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,710
somebody can take away a prisoner

745
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,190
from the jail of Zhu Xi.

746
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,880
Who saved you?

747
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,840
How?

748
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,840
You don’t know him even if I tell you.

749
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,590
I must know him if he is able

750
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,150
to save someone from Zhu Xi’s jail.

751
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,510
There is no time.

752
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,920
His army

753
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,760
will arrive soon.

754
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,440
Can you take me

755
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,230
to see Linglong first?

756
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,760
Don’t worry.

757
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,800
She is very safe in Zhaodu.

758
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,550
Zhu Xi was shocked

759
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,670
by her mightiness just now.

760
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,480
I don’t think

761
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,800
he will take actions so quickly.

762
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,550
Moreover, he has only

763
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,000
slightly more than 100 people with him.

764
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,550
They are being supervised
by the Moon Guards

765
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,800
and won’t threaten us in any way.

766
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,480
Don’t be cheated by him.

767
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,190
Linglong’s Ritual of Eternity is

768
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,000
the best chance for him to take actions.

769
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,670
If he can kill the Goddess on the altar,

770
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,590
he will be able to replace Yuan Yi

771
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,710
in the most stunning way.

772
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,840
You can ask them.

773
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,400
Zhu Xi has borrowed

774
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,110
all the fish boats of Weisheng Yan

775
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,510
and what we have is just one of them.

776
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,880
Other boats will possibly

777
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,590
arrive soon.

778
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,190
Zhu Xi does want to attack Zhaodu.

779
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,280
Somebody.

780
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,920
Keep a close eye

781
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,030
on the defenses around Zhaodu and

782
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,230
report to me upon anything abnormal.

783
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,880
Ask all people of the Moon Tribe

784
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,880
to gather with the Moon Guards.

785
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,000
All the guards in all four directions

786
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,840
must watch out and

787
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,880
shoot down any fish boat of Zhu Xi

788
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,840
upon discovery.

789
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,360
No fish boat is permitted

790
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,550
to pass the Moon Guards.

791
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,840
Yes.

792
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,920
If Zhaodu isn’t safe

793
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,150
as you said,

794
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,030
the Moon Guards must be

795
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,590
the safest place
for its unique location.

796
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,440
Just wait here

797
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,030
and I will dispatch someone
to take Linglong here.

798
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,630
Let’s figure out Zhu Xi’s plan

799
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,760
before any further arrangement.

800
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,280
Thanks, Minister Fei.

801
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,440
Linglong.

802
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,670
Linglong!

803
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:00,630
Where is the Goddess?

804
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,360
Just now a Moon Guard reported

805
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,320
the Goddess’s father
had come to Zhaodu

806
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,760
and the Goddess had gone to meet him.

807
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:08,710
What?

808
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,480
Your Majesty!

809
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,480
The Goddess isn’t found.

810
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,000
Your Majesty!

811
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:21,880
Your Majesty!

812
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,440
Not found.

813
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
This is Zhaodu.

814
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,230
It is my territory.

815
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,230
Go and search again!

816
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,230
Aye.

817
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,840
Your Majesty!

818
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,510
Marquis Pingjiang is gone, too.

819
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,000
What?

820
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,760
Your Majesty!

821
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,280
Both Linglong and Zhu Xi are gone.

822
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,880
According to Linglong’s father,

823
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,230
Zhu Xi may attack Zhaodu at any time.

824
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:46,960
I shouldn’t have

825
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,710
spared his life.

826
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,070
Zhu Xi is well prepared for it.

827
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,230
All Guards of Immortal Blood.

828
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,190
Please listen.

829
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,480
Distribute my order

830
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,630
to guard the city gate strictly

831
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,670
and never admit anybody to go in and out.

832
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:04,960
Aye.
