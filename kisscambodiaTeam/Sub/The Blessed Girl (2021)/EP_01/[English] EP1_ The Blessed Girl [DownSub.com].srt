=The Blessed Girl=

22
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,260
=Episode 1=

23
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,470
I’m Linglong,

24
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,190
surnamed Huotu,

25
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,510
born into the Fire Tribe.

26
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,920
My father said

27
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,310
every life in our tribe

28
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,070
is a gift from ancestors,

29
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,120
but other tribesmen said

30
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,830
I was only born

31
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,560
because my father

32
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,120
broke ancestors’ rules.

33
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,800
By the way, his name is Huotu Xin.

34
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,870
He can bake meat pies,

35
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,750
but

36
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,830
the dough can be hard

37
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,600
and the meat stuffing salty.

38
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,510
His fresh ground soybean milk

39
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,560
always contains dregs.

40
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
He can cook everything

41
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,190
including all that you’ve eaten

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,310
or not.

43
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,270
Over the past 16 years,

44
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,680
he’s done all the cooking.

45
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,680
I’m the luckiest girl

46
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,270
to be able to enjoy the food he makes.

47
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Linglong,

48
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,510
rise and shine, sleepyhead.

49
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,390
Today is your big day.

50
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,310
Linglong.

51
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,000
Linglong!

52
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,950
Father.

53
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,160
Father.

54
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,270
Father!

55
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,070
Father.

56
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,830
I didn’t mean to

57
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,240
sneak out behind your back.

58
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,480
You stayed up late last night.

59
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,800
I didn’t want to wake you up.

60
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,000
Would you rather

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,830
see me worrying?

62
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,870
I know, I know.

63
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,240
You’re

64
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,190
quite fragile.

65
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,070
I must protect

66
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,950
your feelings,

67
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,510
right?

68
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,310
You little troublemaker!

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,160
I knew

70
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,000
you went to the Glory Rock,

71
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,680
didn’t you?

72
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,240
I’m a big girl now.

73
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,870
You can stop worrying too much.

74
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,240
I can take care of myself.

75
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,870
Really?

76
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,800
Even adults wouldn’t go uphill

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,870
before dawn.

78
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,600
It’s slippery and dangerous,

79
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,070
you know?

80
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
Could you protect yourself?

81
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,630
Look,

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,190
I was there to pick

83
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,510
the first Dormant Lotus

84
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,600
blooming towards the sun

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
on the Glory Rock.

86
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,040
Isn’t it beautiful?

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,430
It is.

88
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,830
I’m giving it to Mother.

89
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,560
This is my first time

90
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,190
seeing her.

91
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,270
Linglong.

92
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,950
Father!

93
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,680
Stop there.

94
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,630
-Catch me if you can.
-Stop!

95
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,190
Come here.

96
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:34,700
(Beloved Wife Jin’er)

97
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,390
Mother,

98
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,480
wait for me.

99
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,040
I’ll see you later.

100
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,270
Don’t be so sure.

101
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,560
Only if you pass the test

102
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,510
will you be on the Mountain Team

103
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,870
and go to the Flame Chilling Wall.

104
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,630
Don’t let your mother down.

105
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,830
Of course I won’t!

106
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,270
Ever since the Earth Fire Test was held,

107
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,600
no one has passed with flying colors.

108
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,120
That’s because I haven’t taken it.

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,950
That’s my girl.

110
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,070
Moon Grass!

111
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,920
You found it!

112
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,390
Seeing the rain

113
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,480
last night, I thought

114
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,070
there’d be some this morning.

115
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,830
Look at you!

116
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,270
You also went uphill before dawn.

117
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,270
Alright. Enough.

118
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,040
Eat it while it’s hot.

119
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,360
What do you think?

120
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,680
Is it good?

121
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,910
Just relax.

122
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,150
Focus on the Test.

123
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,440
Don’t feel pressured.

124
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,960
You don’t need a clean sweep

125
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,320
to be on the Mountain Team.

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
If I didn’t make it,

127
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,440
you’d be the one to blame

128
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,790
for being a bad teacher.

129
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,550
I’m a bad teacher?

130
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
You know what?

131
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,960
When I was

132
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,270
in the team,

133
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,720
I was the best firefighter.

134
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,390
Or your mother wouldn’t have

135
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,120
fallen for me at first sight.

136
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,960
Didn’t you say

137
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,080
that was because you were handsome?

138
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,670
I can be both.

139
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,840
Father,

140
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,480
why did Mother

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,720
go there?

142
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,480
Others all say...

143
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,480
What do they know?

144
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,320
They’re a bunch of green-eyed bumpkins

145
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,360
because I married your mother.

146
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,550
Your mother gave birth to you.

147
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,840
That’s all you need to know.

148
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,870
I’m no longer a kid

149
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,910
and I deserve the truth.

150
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,030
I made this for you.

151
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,910
It’s beautiful and useful.

152
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,320
You’ll be invincible in it.

153
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,390
Take it.

154
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,910
Father.

155
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,000
Put it on,

156
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
pass the test

157
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,150
and see for yourself.

158
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,320
If you find your mother,

159
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
ask her for me

160
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
why she went there that day.

161
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,240
By that day,

162
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,440
he meant the day I was born.

163
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,120
The place my mother went

164
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,550
is called Flame Chilling Wall

165
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,870
built by our ancestors.

166
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,870
Behind that wall

167
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,360
is the Earth Fire
that once destroyed everything.

168
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
It’s

169
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,360
the most terrifying place in the world

170
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,910
and it’s off-limits.

171
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,080
Only the bravest ones

172
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,240
chosen by the Mountain Team

173
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,790
have access to it.

174
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,840
Of course my father was one of them

175
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
while my mother

176
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,910
wasn’t even born here.

177
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,720
That day,

178
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,750
Father broke the rules

179
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,480
by going through the Wall with Mother

180
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,550
and stepping into the Earth Fire.

181
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,030
500 years ago,

182
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,550
the Earth Fire

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,510
turned our tribe into hell.

184
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,840
By going through the Wall,

185
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
we could go back to that day

186
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,360
and witness

187
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,670
that apocalypse as if

188
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,270
the world had stopped 500 years ago.

189
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,390
No one knows the origin of that fire

190
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,630
or my mother’s background.

191
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,270
That day,

192
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,480
only Father and I came back.

193
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,720
Tribesmen never gave their blessings

194
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,200
to my parents’ marriage

195
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,390
or my birth.

196
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,510
My father was the bravest man here

197
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,030
who had taken the Mountain Team

198
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,480
to extinguish countless fires.

199
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,600
But ever since that day,

200
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,960
he hasn’t been near
the Flame Chilling Wall again

201
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,870
as if he abandoned his duty

202
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,600
to guard the Wall and fight fires

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,360
and forgot my mother.

204
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
But not me.

205
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,790
I’ve waited for 16 years,

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
for this very day

207
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,600
to be on the Mountain Team

208
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,510
so that I can put out
the Earth Fire behind the Wall

209
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,000
and find out everything about my mother.

210
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,840
Today is the day.

211
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,840
I’ll pass the Earth Fire Test.

212
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,270
The Huotus will come back

213
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,390
as heroes of the Mountain Team

214
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,840
and leave our names

215
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,510
on the Glory Rock.

216
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,720
Fire never dies!

217
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,390
Fire never dies!

218
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,670
Do you recognize this?

219
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,840
Flammable Stone!

220
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,510
Such stones with inexhaustible energy

221
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,960
used to be our treasure

222
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,870
and laid the foundation

223
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,790
of our former glory

224
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,630
but they can destroy us as well

225
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,720
as they keep the Earth Fire on

226
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,200
for 500 years.

227
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,960
Flammable Stones

228
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,550
are right under our feet
in the mountains.

229
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,240
Such mines

230
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,240
are all over our tribe.

231
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,000
We can live

232
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,720
to this day

233
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
because our ancestors

234
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,150
built the Flame Chilling Wall

235
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,240
at the cost of their lives

236
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,630
to cut off the mines underground

237
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,600
and seal the Earth Fire

238
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,630
in the Wall.

239
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,670
As their descendants,

240
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,870
we cannot hide
outside the Wall they built

241
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,600
just to make ourselves safe.

242
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,120
Make it stop!

243
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,870
To quench the Earth Fire,

244
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,510
we must find every Flammable Stone mine,

245
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,390
cut them off one by one

246
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,390
until

247
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,000
the last Flammable Stone

248
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
is dug out.

249
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,910
Then

250
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,030
the Earth Fire

251
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,600
will be gone forever.

252
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,670
That’s

253
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,270
the mission we’re born with.

254
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,200
-Fire never dies!
-Fire never dies!

255
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,000
You should know

256
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,080
this is the most dangerous job.

257
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,790
-Also the most glorious one.
-Also the most glorious one.

258
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
Has she no shame

259
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
signing up for the Test?

260
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,550
Well,

261
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,960
I won’t lose

262
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,150
to that oddball.

263
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:14,910
Linglong,

264
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,270
we trust you

265
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,390
and we have nothing to worry about,

266
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,360
right?

267
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:19,480
Yes.

268
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:21,960
Alright.

269
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,390
Prove yourself

270
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,550
in the Test.

271
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,200
Remember,

272
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,670
there are no rules

273
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,150
in the Test.

274
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,910
Don’t get killed

275
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,840
and put out the Earth Fire.

276
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,550
That’s it.

277
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:35,750
But

278
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,390
every judgment,

279
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,600
decision

280
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,390
and move you make

281
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,030
will determine

282
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,480
if you’re qualified to

283
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,030
be on the Mountain Team,

284
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,480
go to the Flame Chilling Wall

285
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,480
and carry on the great mission

286
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,200
our ancestors left undone.

287
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,150
Get yourselves ready.

288
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,200
Follow me.

289
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,150
Prove yourselves.

290
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,120
-Come on!
-You can do it!

291
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,870
Pass the Test! Make us proud!

292
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,000
You must win!

293
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,790
Linglong,

294
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,870
the result doesn’t matter.

295
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,150
I’ll cook your favorite food

296
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,030
and wait for you at home.

297
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,510
I’ll pass the Test.

298
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,000
I know. Go ahead.

299
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,630
You’ll pass it!

300
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,030
I’ll only say this once

301
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,390
because the Earth Fire

302
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,630
won’t give you a second chance.

303
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,600
Centered around the Hawkeye Peak,

304
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
within the 2.5-kilometer radius,

305
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,320
at the long and narrow valley corridor,

306
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,670
there’s simulated Earth Fire

307
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,360
made with fire powder everywhere.

308
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,960
Your task

309
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,840
is to identify the fire route,

310
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,790
block the Earth Fire

311
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,030
and destroy the center of it.

312
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,030
If the fire powder has covered

313
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,080
half of your body,

314
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,510
you’ll be deemed as burned

315
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,960
and eliminated immediately.

316
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,630
Come on!

317
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,270
Come. Why did you stop?

318
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,840
Are you sure we should follow her?

319
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,670
What if we catch bad luck?

320
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,360
Nonsense!

321
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:54,960
Be careful!

322
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,400
You’re welcome.

323
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,400
Linglong, you Huotus

324
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,160
are as good as they say.

325
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,830
I heard a lot from my father

326
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,830
that when your father
was on the Mountain Team,

327
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,310
he put out 18 fires in a row

328
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,830
without losing a hair.

329
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,960
What else did your old man say?

330
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
He also said,

331
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,480
“what a shame”.

332
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,240
Focus.

333
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,510
This isn’t over yet.

334
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,920
Look over there.

335
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,000
Every fire

336
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,510
points to that direction.

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,160
The center must be there.

338
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,310
This could be our chance to win.

339
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,790
Didn’t your father say

340
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,880
the Huotus

341
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,270
are born to win?

342
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,200
The three of us will

343
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,960
destroy the center and be winners.

344
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,720
Xia Ling’s team
has put out another fire.

345
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,350
Most fires on the east side
of the Hawkeye Peak are out.

346
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,920
No one on the two teams is burned.

347
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,720
All of them

348
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,200
have great potential.

349
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,000
No one caught the fire?

350
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,110
They’re swift,

351
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,830
especially Linglong and her members.

352
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,640
They’ve done it

353
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,400
quickly and accurately.

354
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,440
Maybe they’ll all survive.

355
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,960
Since when

356
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,790
was the Earth Fire so nice to people?

357
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,350
Change of plan.

358
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,070
Activate the Burning Ring.

359
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,720
Something is wrong.

360
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,200
What’s up?

361
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,350
If the two fires join each other,

362
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,680
we’ll be trapped inside.

363
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,350
Run!

364
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,030
Go!

365
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,720
Go on!

366
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,680
Hurry up and go!

367
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,480
Luckily, you took the precaution

368
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,680
by using two Stone Freezing Balls.

369
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,750
Goodness!

370
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,310
That was close.

371
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,270
According to my father,

372
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,550
that’s the Burning Ring.

373
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,790
If we got trapped,

374
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,110
we’d be dead for sure.

375
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,240
My father has never said that.

376
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,480
Safety matters the most.

377
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,440
We’ve put out tons of fires.

378
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,720
Destroying the center
is almost impossible.

379
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,440
Anyway,

380
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,680
no one has ever won.

381
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,200
All we need

382
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,880
is a spot on the Mountain Team.

383
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,590
No.

384
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,000
I must win.

385
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,920
More are coming

386
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,750
our way, I think.

387
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,030
There are no rules in the Test.

388
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,920
No rules?

389
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,160
Listen,

390
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,750
hide yourselves.

391
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,480
Don’t go anywhere

392
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,400
near the fire.

393
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,880
Protect yourselves first.

394
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,240
We’ll win.

395
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,400
Fine.

396
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,400
What if Xia Ling

397
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,030
puts out more fires

398
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,790
than us?

399
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,480
That’s not going to happen

400
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,960
because I’m here.

401
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,550
Where are you going?

402
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,160
To fight fires.

403
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,510
Linglong,

404
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
shouldn’t you be with your team members?

405
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,880
What are you doing here?

406
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,720
To extinct the Earth Fire.

407
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,880
What’s your plan?

408
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,750
You’re the real source

409
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,160
of the Earth Fire.

410
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,590
Once I get you,

411
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,350
the Fire will die out.

412
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,830
Let’s see.

413
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,240
Why did you do that?

414
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,720
You said

415
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,310
there are no rules in the Test.

416
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,200
The same goes for the real Earth Fire.

417
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,640
All we need to do

418
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,270
is to put it out.

419
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,550
But you’ve

420
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,270
got burned.

421
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,830
If there’s a chance

422
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
to quench

423
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,350
all the fires within the Wall,

424
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,310
won’t you risk your life?

425
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,310
That’s what

426
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,400
a qualified Mountain Team member

427
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,350
should do,

428
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:02,960
am I right?

429
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,790
Linglong.

430
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,200
Congratulations!

431
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,920
You’re the first one ever

432
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,960
to have put out the Fire completely.

433
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,510
Unfortunately,

434
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,310
you can’t be

435
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,640
on the Mountain Team.

436
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,310
She’s never allowed
to go to the Flame Chilling Wall?

437
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,350
After discussion,

438
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,310
the Elders and I

439
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,960
have reached that decision

440
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,270
and notified Chi Fang.

441
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,350
Even if

442
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,680
she passed the Earth Fire Test?

443
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,510
She won’t.

444
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,110
You...

445
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,160
Huotu Xin, what are you doing?

446
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
Do you know

447
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,070
how much this means to her?

448
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,200
I do.

449
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
This is for the sake
of you and our tribe.

450
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,960
Back then,

451
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,680
you disregarded the rules

452
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,400
and married an outsider,

453
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,880
leading to a huge mess.

454
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,720
We cannot afford another risk.

455
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,110
The past is the past.

456
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,400
Can’t you let it go?

457
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,030
Linglong

458
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,550
carries the blood of a foreign tribe.

459
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,270
Once she went there

460
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,720
and offended the ancestors,

461
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,720
there could be dire consequences.

462
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,110
How could she offend them?

463
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,830
Tell me about it!

464
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:13,920
What’s her surname?

465
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,550
It’s Huotu!

466
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,440
Ancestors couldn’t be
happier seeing her.

467
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,160
The Huotus

468
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,510
inherit that surname from
the great Founding Father

469
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,200
of our tribe, Huotu Ke.

470
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,920
Shut up!

471
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
I won’t!

472
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,790
I’m surprised that you still remember

473
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,480
Huotu is our Founding Father’s surname.

474
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,720
But look at you!

475
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,920
What’s wrong with me?

476
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,920
You abdicated your responsibility

477
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,160
for a foreign woman,

478
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
and left the Mountain Team

479
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,400
to babysit

480
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,480
your daughter at home.

481
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,400
Are you still a Huotu?

482
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,880
I won’t change my decision.

483
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,830
Period!

484
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,830
Huotu Xin.

485
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,400
Leader.

486
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,960
Is Linglong back yet?

487
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,920
Linglong?

488
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,400
What happened?

489
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,480
She was upset

490
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,830
because she didn’t make the cut

491
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,830
and she quarreled with Xia Ling.

492
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,830
I’m worried...

493
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,480
If anything happens to her,

494
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,830
I’ll make all of you pay!

495
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
Huotu Xin!

496
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,480
What did you tell him?

497
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,640
I said

498
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,000
Linglong

499
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,000
put out all the fires alone.

500
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,160
Did you activate the Burning Ring?

501
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:38,480
Yes,

502
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,590
I did.

503
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,640
How did she succeed?

504
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,400
Father.

505
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,160
Will your name

506
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,830
be carved on the Glory Stone?

507
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,590
Me?

508
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,680
I can’t care less about that.

509
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,400
But I care.

510
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,350
Ever since the first time
you took me here

511
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,720
and told me stories

512
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,200
about those ancestors on the Rock,

513
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:42,880
this place

514
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,030
has become my favorite.

515
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,200
I have tons of

516
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,070
other stories.

517
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,510
We can go to the White Forest next time.

518
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,510
I’ll tell you a story

519
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,590
about the Deer Hunter.

520
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,350
Did they cast me out

521
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,720
because of

522
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,830
what happened to Mother?

523
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,160
Of course not.

524
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,200
You’re a terrible liar.

525
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,790
Do you really think

526
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,200
you’ve grasped the gist

527
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,920
of the Earth Fire

528
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,920
just because you found a loophole?

529
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,310
Hadn’t I done that,

530
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,000
no one would’ve won.

531
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,350
That’s why

532
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,510
no one did.

533
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,920
Because it’s never
about winning or losing.

534
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,070
It’s about life.

535
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,270
When the Earth Fire was blazing,

536
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,240
tens of thousands of our ancestors

537
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,920
sacrificed their lives

538
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,200
to build the Flame Chilling Wall.

539
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,480
Why?

540
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,000
That wasn’t

541
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,270
to seal the Fire

542
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,750
or put their names

543
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,160
on the Glory Rock.

544
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,310
They did that

545
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,590
to protect those

546
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,960
outside the Wall.

547
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,160
Even the wisest ancestor

548
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
didn’t know

549
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,750
when the Earth Fire would stop.

550
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,310
If everyone

551
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,270
threw themselves

552
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
into the fire like you

553
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,270
only to win,

554
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,030
what would happen?

555
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,240
There’d be no one left

556
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,680
to fill the cracks

557
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,070
on the Flame Chilling Wall.

558
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,510
The Earth Fire would burst out someday

559
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,110
and set not only our tribe

560
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,750
but also the entire Suchuan on fire.

561
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:43,550
That

562
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,110
would be a real catastrophe.

563
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,110
This test

564
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,790
is lesson one of the Mountain Team.

565
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,480
It teaches you

566
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
that life is more important

567
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,270
than putting out the Earth Fire.

568
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,510
That’s ancestors’ teaching.

569
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,960
So

570
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,920
it’s fair that you lost.

571
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,790
Don’t blame others for it.

572
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,440
But

573
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
that’s

574
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,240
different

575
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
from what Chi Fang said.

576
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,000
What does he know?

577
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,510
Were I still on the Team,

578
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,350
he wouldn’t

579
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,590
become the team leader.

580
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,680
I don’t believe you.

581
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,640
I swear

582
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,400
to all the ancestors on the Rock

583
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,350
that everything

584
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,070
I said

585
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,830
is nothing but the truth.

586
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,480
You know, your mother

587
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,590
isn’t behind the Flame Chilling Wall.

588
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,240
She’s in your heart

589
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,720
keeping you company.

590
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,750
I understand, Father.

591
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
I’d like to hang out here for a while.

592
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,590
Just go home without me.

593
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
It’s... It’s getting dark.

594
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,160
Please!

595
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,480
Fine, alright.

596
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,680
Just a little while.

597
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,000
I’m leaving.

598
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,830
Come home

599
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,550
before it’s dark.

600
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,510
Fine.

601
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,640
-Or the food will get cold.
-I know.

602
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,150
No sign of her.

603
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,280
I looked everywhere but didn’t see her.

604
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,030
Don’t panic.

605
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,590
Our village is small.

606
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,030
She must be somewhere nearby.

607
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,150
Where are you going?

608
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,630
To find my daughter.

609
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,480
Do you know where she is?

610
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,360
We’ve got so many men looking for her.

611
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,440
You won’t help me.

612
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,920
What’s that supposed to mean?

613
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,400
Aren’t we helping you now?

614
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,070
No one wants her to get hurt.

615
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,190
She must’ve

616
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,030
gone to the Flame Chilling Wall.

617
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,360
What?

618
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,190
What are you waiting for?

619
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,550
Go there now!

620
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,800
Follow me!

621
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,510
Leader,

622
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,920
you aren’t mad at her?

623
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,760
Not now.

624
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,760
We’ve got more important things to do.

625
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,800
Shizi,

626
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,550
hey,

627
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,760
when can we stop doing this?

628
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,880
Stop whining.

629
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,190
There’s no one down there.

630
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,150
Go down and stand guard.

631
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,150
It’s late.

632
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,920
Who’d go through the Wall?

633
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,880
Do you still have liquor?

634
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,070
Let’s drink.

635
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:04,800
Danzi!

636
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,840
Look.

637
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,880
Anyone?

638
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,670
Leader.

639
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,230
What...? What brings you here this late?

640
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,110
Did Linglong go inside?

641
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,000
Has anyone got in?

642
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,480
I don’t think so.

643
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,400
You don’t think so?

644
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,360
I don’t know.

645
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,320
Even if she’s inside,

646
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,960
the fires there are unpredictable.

647
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,230
Without our fire map,

648
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,030
she won’t get to the Palace of Flames.

649
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,550
Have you forgotten about the Test?

650
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,360
Huotu Xin!

651
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,320
You came faster than I thought.

652
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,110
Perfect timing. Let’s go.

653
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,190
It’s dark.

654
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,320
We can come again next time.

655
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,190
You’re lying again.

656
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,190
Linglong!

657
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,030
Father.

658
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,920
I don’t get to

659
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,360
come here again, do I?

660
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,670
I’ve promised Mother.

661
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,280
I just want to see

662
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,510
the place where she passed away.

663
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,110
I’m always eager...

664
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,230
To see for myself.

665
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,110
Do you know

666
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,920
your mother

667
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,960
once looked at me in the same way?

668
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,510
She begged me to bring her here.

669
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,840
Although we weren’t together

670
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,150
for too long,

671
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,150
every moment we shared

672
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,280
is the most precious memory

673
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,360
to me.

674
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,030
It’s irreplaceable.

675
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,150
But that one is the only exception.

676
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,550
I regret it a million times

677
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,590
and I’ll never

678
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,960
forgive myself for it.

679
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,280
I wish I could

680
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,840
undo what I did.

681
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,070
Linglong,

682
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,320
you’re

683
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,110
everything I have now.

684
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,150
I cannot

685
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,510
have another regret.

686
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,320
Well then,

687
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,960
stay close to me.

688
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,360
Linglong!

689
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,150
Stop!

690
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,110
Linglong!

691
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,280
Linglong!

692
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:43,840
Linglong!

693
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,670
Linglong, where are you?

694
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,320
Linglong!

695
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,550
Linglong!

696
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,110
Come back!

697
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,800
It’s dangerous!

698
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,550
Linglong!

699
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,710
Linglong!

700
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,630
Linglong!

701
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,760
Linglong!

702
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,030
Linglong!

703
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,670
Linglong!

704
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,070
Linglong, watch out!

705
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,280
Father!

706
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,150
Hang in there!

707
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,230
Linglong.

708
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,320
Everything will be fine.

709
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,590
I’m here.

710
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,190
Come, Linglong.

711
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,230
Linglong.

712
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,630
Leader, what’s that?

713
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,150
Does that come from
the Palace of Flames?

714
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,710
What...?

715
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,150
What’s that, Leader?

716
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,550
Is that ancestors’ warning?

717
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,230
What should we do, Leader?

718
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,400
Say something, Leader!

719
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,800
Be careful!

720
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,150
What’s that?

721
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,440
No idea.

722
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,800
What is that thing?

723
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,320
Leader, what’s that?

724
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,110
Should we attack?

725
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,320
Is it the Fire Demon?

726
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,510
A monster!

727
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,280
Be careful. Watch out.

728
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,550
Kill her.

729
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,920
Stop!

730
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:17,400
Run!

731
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,400
Linglong, it’s me!

732
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,190
I’m your father, Linglong!

733
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,800
Wake up!

734
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,320
Stop!

735
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Don’t hurt her.

736
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,510
Relax.

737
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,480
I won’t.

738
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,710
She won’t hurt others either.

739
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,710
Do you recognize me?

740
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,360
He’s your father.

741
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,230
You shouldn’t have hit him.

742
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,150
You can cure him,

743
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,550
right?

744
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,440
Linglong,

745
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,800
is it you?

746
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:39,880
Cover her.

747
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,590
Linglong.

748
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,630
Linglong.

749
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,230
You’re fine. Everything is fine.

750
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,840
Where’s that monster?

751
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,440
Be careful.

752
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,320
That’s not a monster.

753
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:15,110
Don’t be scared

754
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:17,230
or try to hurt her.

755
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,920
You should be in awe of her

756
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,190
because

757
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,280
she’s your Goddess.

758
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,360
It’s true that Goddess

759
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,150
has never left.
