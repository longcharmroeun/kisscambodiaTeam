<i>Episode 16</i>

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,470
Your Majesty.

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
Everyone’s here?

26
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,680
Father.

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,190
What’s going on?

28
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,190
Why are we

29
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,080
in the Fire Tribe?

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,960
Because

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,150
we’re fleeing.

32
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Greetings to Your Highness.

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,910
Greetings to Chief Priest.

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,840
Weisheng Yan.

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,150
Good for your winning game.

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,150
I don’t understand

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,030
what you said.

38
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,030
Why would Wu Yuan help them leave?

39
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,240
Well.

40
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,310
I really don’t know.

41
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,680
I’m doing my best to support you.

42
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,190
My loyalty

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,360
is known by all.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
Weisheng Yan.

45
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,710
Compared with your scheme,

46
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,430
your little humbleness

47
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,910
is ridiculous.

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,960
Looks like Marquis Pingjiang

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,630
only has

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,150
such ungrateful guys.

51
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,560
Listen, Zhu Xi.

52
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,430
All people in Suchuan

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,430
have known Goddess has come again.

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,910
His Majesty

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,150
is the chosen emperor.

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,470
The emperor who is blessed by Goddess

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,070
is not the one who

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,870
can be controlled by vassals anymore.

59
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,240
If you hurt Goddess again,

60
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,160
you are the enemy of Tianqi

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,480
and the world.

62
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,800
The enemy of the world?

63
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,800
After the birds were killed,

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,310
a fox is still left behind.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,630
Such a trouble it is.

66
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,430
The situation is not stable yet.

67
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,560
You still need some friends.

68
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,480
You are right.

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,310
But this friend can only be used,

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
but not trusted.

71
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,070
If I guess it right,

72
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,560
all of you

73
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,360
will be sentenced to be

74
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,720
the wanted criminals who

75
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,870
created rebellion

76
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
and abducted His Majesty.

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,390
I will not

78
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,680
allow anyone to frame them up.

79
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,190
That’s my thought, too.

80
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,870
Don’t speak weirdly.

81
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,510
Just tell us.

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,680
I’m

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,040
not a smart guy.

84
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,560
But it’s better than him.

85
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,190
I don’t know

86
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,120
about the court or political tactics.

87
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,950
You smart ones

88
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,360
can analyze for me.

89
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,920
Zhu Xi and Chief Priest work together.

90
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,390
What’s their purpose?

91
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
To kill Fei Tian,

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,720
wipe out the forces around His Majesty,

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,920
and finally

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,390
control His Majesty

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,630
and the entire Suchuan.

96
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,560
Then why didn’t he

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,390
just kill His Majesty

98
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,830
and replace him?

99
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,000
Since ancient times, the Yuan family

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,240
has been the emperor

101
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,750
of the world.

102
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,720
God chose the emperor.

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,310
How can he be replaced?

104
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,830
You indeed belong

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,390
to the oldest noble family in Suchuan.

106
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,360
You think exactly the same

107
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,360
with Zhu Xi.

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,390
So,

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,870
Zhu Xi wanted to kill me

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,070
so as to get rid of the God
who chose the emperor.

111
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,920
But Chief Priest wanted to kill Fei Tian

112
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,830
to help me become Goddess.

113
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,360
Though they worked

114
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
together to kill Fei Tian,

115
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
their purposes

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,560
are totally different.

117
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,870
Smart girl.

118
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,800
But it’s a pity that

119
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,600
Suchuan can’t allow

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
such a smart Goddess to live.

121
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,240
But Weisheng Yan is different.

122
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,950
Weisheng Yan,

123
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,920
no matter what method you use,

124
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,390
the news that His Majesty is missing

125
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,390
can’t be leaked,

126
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,310
and His Majesty

127
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,830
can’t show up outside Zhaodu.

128
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,800
Bring His Majesty back

129
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,600
before the old fox does.

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,750
Aye.

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,190
I want to see the Goddess,
alive or dead.

132
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,160
But His Majesty

133
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,160
must be safe and sound.

134
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,190
Your loyalty

135
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,750
shall be learned by the world.

136
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
Weisheng Yan.

137
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,270
What’s this?

138
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,310
The throne.

139
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,270
Whose throne is it?

140
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,560
The emperor of Suchuan, of course.

141
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,720
Since it is a throne,

142
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,240
a man

143
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,680
must sit on it.

144
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
An alive one.

145
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,630
Though you put enough gold on it,

146
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,190
it can’t receive people’s reverence,

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,510
let alone to govern the country.

148
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,390
It’s indeed no use

149
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,840
of putting gold on the throne,

150
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,390
but when they are put
in people’s pockets,

151
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,360
they can drive them to do a lot.

152
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
As to that,

153
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,000
you and I

154
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,630
become friends because of gold,
don’t we?

155
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,240
Friends?

156
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,750
Weisheng Yan.

157
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,870
Remember.

158
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
Between the honorable and the humble,

159
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,840
there will be no friends.

160
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,270
There are

161
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,910
only usefulness

162
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,600
and uselessness.

163
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,270
It’s lucky that

164
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,910
you are a useful man.

165
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,870
Thanks, Your Highness.

166
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
The noble, God and throne.

167
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
They’re all Weisheng Yan’s enemies.

168
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,320
No matter which of them succeeds,

169
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,240
it’s the same for Weisheng Yan.

170
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,240
But he’s also a man

171
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,390
who won’t do anything unprofitable.

172
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,080
So

173
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,120
if he can work with Chief Priest

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,840
and Zhu Xi,

175
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,270
he must have a bigger plan.

176
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,270
If we can know

177
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,720
what Weisheng Yan’s plan is,

178
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,000
and make use of it,

179
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,910
maybe we still have a chance
to change the situation.

180
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,750
You are all smart.

181
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,720
It’s indeed not a good idea

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,390
to fight against you.

183
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,630
But

184
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,790
why are we in the Fire Tribe?

185
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,480
Because all secrets

186
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,840
are in the Fire Tribe,

187
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,600
related to you.

188
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,960
I don’t know what Weisheng Yan’s

189
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,000
purpose is,

190
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,270
and if His Majesty finding Linglong

191
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,390
has anything to do with him.

192
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,030
But I know

193
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,840
he has a thorough plan.

194
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,270
And Linglong

195
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,550
is an important part of the plan.

196
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,910
He’s the person who secretly drives

197
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,200
Linglong to go to Zhaodu to be the Goddess.

198
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,790
Since Linglong was born,

199
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,600
Weisheng Yan has been
paying attention to her.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,150
Since I was born?

201
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,120
Yes.

202
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,390
Or even earlier.

203
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,270
To the time

204
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,840
when your mother came to the Fire Tribe.

205
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,270
My mother

206
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,240
was related

207
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,240
to all of this?

208
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,270
It’s possible that

209
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,360
your mother came to the Fire Tribe

210
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,390
to find the Palace of Flames.

211
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,080
If you say so,

212
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,750
everything can be explained,

213
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,670
no matter the monster girl

214
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,550
that Zhu Xi brought

215
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,440
or the thing that Tianqi followers

216
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,720
sent by Chief Priest to the Fire Tribe

217
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,550
died one by one.

218
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,870
All we have investigated in Zhaodu

219
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,320
directs to 17 years ago,

220
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
or actually

221
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,150
the Fire Tribe 17 years ago.

222
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,030
What’s in the Palace of Flames?

223
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,390
Why are you looking at me?

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,960
I’ve never been there, either.

225
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,960
Though it’s Weisheng Yan’s boat,

226
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,910
I feel

227
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,480
kind of reluctant to throw it.

228
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,630
The boat is too conspicuous.

229
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,270
Do you still hurt?

230
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,440
Much better.

231
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,150
Well.

232
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,510
Wu Yuan’s medicine

233
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,480
is quite good actually.

234
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,320
Sure.

235
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,440
The medicine

236
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,240
can grow flesh on the dead body.

237
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,480
Save it when you use.

238
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,390
It’s the only bottle.

239
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,480
I took it from Weisheng Yan’s.

240
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,790
I finally come back home!

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,550
So nice.

242
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,720
We’ve been out for long.

243
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,150
How come I never heard you said

244
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,360
you missed home?

245
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,240
It’s…

246
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,200
It’s because I’ve been with you

247
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,960
all the time.

248
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,750
Wherever you are is my home.

249
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,030
You clever girl.

250
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,600
It’s true.

251
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,390
Linglong,

252
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,670
I’m sorry.

253
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,030
I failed to give you

254
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
what I promised.

255
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,080
Not that.

256
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,120
You give a better me.

257
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,240
Let’s go home.

258
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,790
Go.

259
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,480
This way.

260
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,840
What’s in your bag?

261
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,440
Weisheng Yan’s gifts to me.

262
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,870
You’re not willing to

263
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,870
throw Weisheng Yan’s gifts?

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,840
They’re innocent.

265
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,510
Why throw them?

266
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,910
The boat,

267
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,600
the medicine,

268
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,360
and this.

269
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,870
How many stuffs have you taken

270
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,870
from Weisheng Yan?

271
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,720
Next time I’ll take his life.

272
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,870
Let’s go.

273
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,000
I’m starving.

274
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,480
She does recognize the way.

275
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,790
An old horse always knows the way.

276
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,240
Wait.

277
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,960
What’s the matter?

278
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,910
Someone’s there?

279
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,550
Why are you being so shocked?

280
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,320
Can you wait here?

281
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,870
We haven’t been home for long.

282
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,840
There must be a mess.

283
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,320
Let me clean it first.

284
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,720
Look what time it is.

285
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,960
There are so many of us.

286
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,150
We can’t be seen by the Leader.

287
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,550
Go, go, go.

288
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,270
No way.

289
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,550
Clean it up first.

290
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,960
Clean… Clean it up.

291
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,440
Wait a minute.

292
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,630
What are you doing?

293
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,000
Go.

294
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,440
I’m back.

295
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,870
I’m back, too.

296
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,630
It’s nice to be home.

297
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,000
It looks fine.

298
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,960
Not a mess.

299
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,960
I’ll go to call them in.

300
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,840
What?

301
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,750
Change your clothes first.

302
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,000
You’re right.

303
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,720
Change clothes.

304
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,120
Huotu Xin

305
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,440
is quite pitiful.

306
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,550
Why is that?

307
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,670
Could Jin’er marry him

308
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,910
for going to the Palace of Flames?

309
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,390
Could it be that

310
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,960
she had never loved him?

311
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,440
Yet Huotu Xin has kept the secret

312
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,320
alone for so many years

313
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,120
from Linglong.

314
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,120
If you think so,

315
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,510
don’t you feel he’s pitiful?

316
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,870
This is the responsibility

317
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,080
a man should take.

318
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,480
It’s not easy, is it?

319
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,270
I haven’t worn these clothes for long.

320
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,910
How’s it?

321
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,240
Do I look handsome with these?

322
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,750
Yes.

323
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
My father is the most handsome.

324
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,600
I’m not used to seeing you wearing

325
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
the clothes to clean the floor yet.

326
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,150
What?

327
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,200
You don’t want Yuan Yi

328
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,960
to see this?

329
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,270
After staying in the palace,

330
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,030
you hate our shabby home?

331
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,080
With guests coming,

332
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,840
I should clean it up.

333
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,630
Move away.

334
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,390
I’m cleaning the floor.

335
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,510
Have you

336
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,550
fallen in love with him?

337
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,870
I don’t know.

338
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,360
You… You don’t know?

339
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,030
How can you

340
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,000
not know it?

341
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,390
So…

342
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,120
So you like him?

343
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,790
Whatever you say.

344
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,320
You… You didn’t deny me!

345
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,030
Alright, Father.

346
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,030
Yuan Yi just lost Fei Tian

347
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,240
and Zhaodu.

348
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,390
Don’t talk nonsense before him.

349
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,160
Now

350
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,920
it’s not the time to talk about this.

351
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,750
Now it’s not the time?

352
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,440
So it means

353
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,400
there will be the time.

354
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,680
Sorry to keep you waiting.

355
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,000
Where’s Wu Yuan?

356
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
She said she didn’t want to
go to your house.

357
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,830
You’ll see her in the Palace of Flames.

358
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,790
Well.

359
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,240
Didn’t she say she’s starving?

360
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,350
Why didn’t you watch her?

361
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,750
You seem to care about her a lot.

362
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,240
She’s been suspicious.

363
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,510
We should be

364
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,480
cautious, right?

365
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,510
Okay.

366
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,070
I’ll find her then.

367
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,110
Alright. It’s fine.

368
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,790
She’s not a noisy girl.

369
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,310
She’s not used to being treated well.

370
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,440
A hardy girl as she is.

371
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,310
Linglong has almost done
with the cleaning.

372
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,720
Let’s be ready.

373
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,240
And we can go to
the Palace of Flames soon.

374
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,000
Yuan Yi.

375
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,200
Follow me.

376
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,680
To where?

377
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,830
Let’s go to survey
in the Flame Chilling Wall.

378
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,030
Have you decided how to tell Linglong?

379
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,160
I will.

380
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,400
Why do you stop?

381
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,160
Come here.

382
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,400
I have something to tell you.

383
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,510
Do you see the necklace that

384
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,070
Linglong is wearing?

385
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,480
Yes.

386
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,790
Do you want me

387
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,070
to send some jewelries to Linglong

388
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,510
to please her first,

389
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,880
and then tell her the truth?

390
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,750
What are you thinking?

391
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,510
Is my daughter that kind of person?

392
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,590
So you are…?

393
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,590
Linglong’s power is controlled.

394
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
It’s related to the necklace.

395
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,720
It’s possible that

396
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,680
the necklace

397
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,240
has suppressed her power
inside the body,

398
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,350
controlled Goddess’ power,

399
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,000
and helped her retain her original look.

400
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Where did you

401
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,240
get this necklace?

402
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,510
Linglong’s mother,

403
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,440
Jin’er, left it.

404
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,270
Who on earth is

405
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,070
Linglong’s mother?

406
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,240
17 years ago,

407
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,270
Jin’er came to the Fire Tribe

408
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,480
with the secret in her body.

409
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,160
It’s ridiculous that

410
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,590
though I stayed with her all day,

411
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,550
I never found

412
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,920
any difference inside her body.

413
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,790
And

414
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,750
once I also thought

415
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,200
she was a monster.

416
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,830
The Goddess you believed in

417
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,510
is indeed a monster

418
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,110
in Jin’er’s eyes.

419
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,400
She must have known some truth.

420
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,000
So she came to the Fire Tribe

421
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,720
to look for a way of removing the power.

422
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,960
So you’re taking them
to the Palace of Flames

423
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,400
not because of Weisheng Yan,

424
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,680
but for Linglong.

425
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,720
Both of that.

426
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,070
After all,

427
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,310
all these

428
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,920
seem to direct to Weisheng Yan.

429
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,270
I also want to help you.

430
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,110
Once you have no trouble,

431
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,110
Linglong has less to worry about.

432
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,110
But does Linglong

433
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,640
know it?

434
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,110
Linglong

435
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,160
never believed that

436
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,510
her mother is a monster.

437
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,310
So

438
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,000
she’s trying hard

439
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,920
to become the Goddess

440
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,920
to prove to everyone.

441
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,880
Sorry.

442
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,000
When Linglong was born,

443
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,880
Jin’er must have found

444
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,000
something weird in her.

445
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,110
So she broke into the Palace of Flames

446
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,030
at any risk.

447
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,790
If Jin’er told me

448
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,920
the truth at that time,

449
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,160
I can face it with her.

450
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,160
In that case,

451
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,480
at least Linglong

452
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,200
still has Mother now.

453
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,750
She must be afraid

454
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,510
that the truth will hurt you.

455
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,830
But we are family.

456
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,310
Families are supposed

457
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,270
to face difficulty

458
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,270
and help each other,

459
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,200
aren’t they?

460
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,400
But for 16 years,

461
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
you also haven’t told Linglong
the truth.

462
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,000
Jin’er and I both made mistakes.

463
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,790
I hope you

464
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,720
will not do that again.

465
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,440
I’ve told you

466
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,750
Linglong’s secret.

467
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,920
Are you

468
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,240
taking me as your family?

469
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,030
Honestly,

470
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,310
after going through all these,

471
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,110
I can also tell that

472
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,000
you

473
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,030
are a nice boy.

474
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,920
So I’ve made up my mind.

475
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,750
After all these are gone,

476
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,680
I will let Linglong

477
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,110
take you as her brother.

478
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,310
You can become sworn brother and sister.

479
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,750
Alright.

480
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:52,830
Go back.

481
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,350
Brother and sister?

482
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,270
Wait.

483
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,960
Aren’t we going to survey

484
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,400
in the entrance
of the Flame Chilling Wall?

485
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,680
There’s no need to survey.

486
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,400
I will take you in.

487
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,480
Your Majesty.

488
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,400
Why are you here?

489
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,480
Yin Zhuang was worried.

490
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,350
She asked me to have a check.

491
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,440
It’s my place.

492
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,400
What’s the worry for?

493
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,830
This is from Yin Zhuang.

494
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,240
Thanks then.

495
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,720
Thank Yin Zhuang, too.

496
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,000
How’s the entrance?

497
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,270
It… It’s good.

498
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,640
Is it right, brat?

499
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,400
Yes.

500
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,000
Go.

501
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,960
Huotu Xin.

502
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,240
We are men.

503
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,550
Whenever it is,

504
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,960
we should take the country
as a priority.

505
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,680
You stopped Gu Shi with your own power.

506
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,960
I respect that.

507
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,790
But now Zhaodu has been occupied,

508
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,880
and His Majesty is in exile.

509
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,200
In this moment,

510
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,030
you can’t give up your responsibility

511
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,790
for your own love.

512
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,590
Why are you

513
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,350
telling me this suddenly?

514
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,480
Nothing.

515
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,830
I just want to remind you.

516
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,830
Did you overhear my talk with Yuan Yi?

517
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,270
Overhear?

518
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,550
No.

519
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,070
What did you say about Yin Zhuang?

520
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,240
Yin Zhuang?

521
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,480
What’s wrong with Yin Zhuang?

522
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,750
Nothing.

523
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,160
Now many things are happening.

524
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,070
Don’t talk nonsense to His Majesty.

525
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,680
I didn’t talk nonsense.

526
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,590
Subordinates should share
His Majesty’s worry,

527
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,790
crack down the plots,

528
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,400
and help His Majesty take Zhaodu back.

529
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,790
I was just talking with him

530
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,830
about something between men.

531
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,350
It has nothing to do with state affairs.

532
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,310
I am talking with you

533
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,160
exactly about the things between men.

534
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,590
Yin Xiao.

535
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,310
You

536
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,720
are a good subordinate

537
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,790
and a good man.

538
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,200
All you said are right.

539
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,480
But I…

540
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,960
I don’t have so many wishes.

541
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,160
I only hope I can be like a common man

542
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,310
to manage my small home

543
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,030
and live my normal life

544
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,480
thoroughly and earnestly.

545
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,750
The others have nothing to do with me.

546
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,640
Common man?

547
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,110
You are

548
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,200
a quite common man.

549
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,240
I’ll take it as a praise.

550
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
That’s not what I mean.

551
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,550
I’m saying that

552
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,920
you’ve had a

553
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,880
cute daughter,

554
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,400
and a small home worth protecting.

555
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:44,960
Yeah.

556
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,590
But sometimes I will still think that

557
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,000
if it can be better.

558
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,680
Why are you still unsatisfied?

559
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,750
As to men,

560
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,000
though you have the world,

561
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,030
you also hope

562
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,070
when you come back,

563
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,000
someone is waiting for you.

564
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,110
When you open the door,

565
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
the dishes have been ready.

566
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,750
You’re back.

567
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,030
Come to have the meal then.

568
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,030
Why are you looking at me?

569
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,070
Sit… Sit down.

570
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,070
Why are you staring at me?

571
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,000
Sit down.

572
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,000
So many dishes.

573
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,880
You cooked them all?

574
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,440
Not at all.

575
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,680
Linglong said

576
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,070
she wanted Yuan Yi to taste

577
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,880
-the Fire Tribe’s dishes.
-Here.

578
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,310
Taste it.

579
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,510
It’s much better

580
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,590
than the dishes in Zhaodu.

581
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,400
When have you become so diligent?

582
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,240
Have your meal.

583
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,830
Taste it first.

584
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,240
Yin Zhuang made it.

585
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,510
The Bright Moon Island’s specialty.

586
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,030
Fried chili.

587
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,920
Taste it.

588
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,790
Is it from the Bright Moon Island?

589
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,640
I need to taste it then.

590
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,000
Is it good?

591
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,070
Yeah.

592
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,590
Is it hot?

593
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,550
No.

594
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,440
Taste it.

595
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,680
Let me have a try.

596
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,030
Brat, go taste it.

597
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,590
Is it hot?

598
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,830
I drink it first. I drink it first.

599
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,790
Give me, Father.

600
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,000
Water.

601
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,070
Come back.

602
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,880
Is it that hot?

603
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,310
Water. Where’s water?

604
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,680
Water. Water. Water.

605
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,110
It’s not hot at all.

Yuan Yi, finish them.

657
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,510
I…

658
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,480
What’s the “ah” for?

659
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,480
How can an emperor waste food?

660
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,110
Father.

661
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,790
This is also made by Yin Zhuang.

662
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,640
Eat it.

663
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,070
And this one.

664
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,720
Taste it.

665
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,480
Is it good?

666
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,680
Yes.

667
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,310
Have you figured out
how to go to the Palace of Flames?

668
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,310
With my help,

669
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,160
you can just rest assured.

670
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,110
We…

671
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,590
Well…

672
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,240
Yuan Yi,

673
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,590
look at the flame.

674
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,680
You know what?

675
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,550
I’m kind of happy now.

676
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,960
Before,

677
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,400
here

678
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,830
hides the secret of my own.

679
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,240
But now,

680
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,070
the truth in the Palace of Flames

681
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,030
is connected with both of us.

682
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,590
It feels

683
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,070
like

684
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,400
the two destinies

685
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,350
are bound to be connected.

686
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:26,880
Linglong.

687
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,880
I have to tell you something.

688
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,160
I…

689
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,550
My father succeeded.

690
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,720
The guards were transferred away.

691
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960
If you have anything,

692
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,720
tell me later.

693
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,510
Let’s go.

694
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,920
This is

695
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,480
indeed amazing.

696
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Now the bracelet has nothing to do

697
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
with Weisheng Yan.

698
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,310
Do you still feel embarrassed

699
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,310
when using it?

700
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,510
I do.

701
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,480
It’s your dowry after all.

702
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,270
If some day you find

703
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,030
your beloved,

704
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,510
but I’m still wearing it,

705
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,880
your brother will cut my hand off.

706
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,960
Well.

707
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,350
If I have my beloved one,

708
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,830
you need to be careful then.

709
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,830
Go.

710
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:28,880
Father.

711
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,000
Good job!

712
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,640
Wu…

713
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,920
Where are the others?

714
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,510
I left her in your home.

715
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,070
I can’t trust her.

716
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,160
Just a few of us go in?

717
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,550
Didn’t you say it’s your place?

718
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,920
Brat,

719
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,750
when I fought

720
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,880
against the Earth Fire,

721
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,790
you were still a little kid.

722
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,270
Do you know what’s most important

723
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,240
to get inside the Wall?

724
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,510
The top priority

725
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,440
is to trust each other in the team.

726
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,110
Or we can’t do anything well.

727
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,880
Hope when we’re back
from the Palace of Flames,

728
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,000
I can be proven to be wrong.

729
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,480
No quarreling.

730
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,000
If someone finds us,

731
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,440
we can’t do anything then.

732
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,920
Don’t forget what’s

733
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,590
the most important task.

734
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,240
Alright, Father.

735
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,440
Let’s go in.

736
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,830
Be careful.

737
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,070
Xiao.

738
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,750
You shouldn’t have done that.

739
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,000
You come here in person.

740
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,270
I think

741
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,000
I should help you here.

742
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,240
If it’s not for the Fire Tribe
and the Flame Chilling Wall,

743
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,790
the Earth Fire

744
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,640
must plunge the people in Suchuan
into misery and suffering.

745
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,030
You are Suchuan’s heroes.

746
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,550
But how did

747
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,270
the Earth Fire be ignited?

748
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,110
Under the ground,

749
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,350
there’s a rich lode of Flammable Stones.

750
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,640
The Flammable Stones keep burning.

751
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,030
So the Earth Fire can’t be put out.

752
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,400
Why did the lode

753
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
of Flammable Stones be ignited?

754
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,400
It can’t ignite itself, can it?

755
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,270
No one knows.

756
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,680
Go.

757
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,110
Don’t tell him now.

758
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,110
Why?

759
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,510
To protect my father.

760
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,240
If he knows

761
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,160
the Earth Fire was set on
by our ancestors,

762
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
he may get crazy.

763
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,480
It’s too cruel

764
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,030
for him.

765
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,200
But you have made it through.

766
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,830
That’s because

767
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,480
you were with me.

768
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,880
But you dared to plan

769
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,750
on hiding from me.

770
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,960
I haven’t forgiven you for that yet.

771
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,070
Yuan Yi.

772
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,840
In the world,

773
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,320
except for my father,

774
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,550
I trust you the most.

775
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
So no matter what

776
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,150
happens in the future,

777
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,550
you can’t hide from me anymore.

778
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,280
So do I.

779
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,150
We can face everything together.

780
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,400
You two,

781
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,190
why are you so sluggish?

782
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,230
Quick.

783
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,190
Linglong.

784
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,510
It’s the place.

785
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,590
Be careful.

786
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,190
Mother!

787
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,110
I promised you

788
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,110
I would come to see you.

789
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,480
Here I am.

790
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,280
Linglong,

791
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,920
when did you get the Dormant Lotus?

792
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,920
When you were sleeping.

793
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,840
Whatever you want to tell your mother,

794
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,630
you can tell her now.

795
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,320
Do you want me to step away?

796
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,550
No.

797
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,670
I have something to ask you.

798
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,280
Do you know

799
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,840
Yin Zhuang likes you?

800
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,280
I know.

801
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,000
But I can’t believe that.

802
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,440
Do you like her?

803
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,590
I…

804
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,110
In front of my mother,

805
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,960
you mustn’t lie.

806
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,800
I dare not like her.

807
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,110
You’re lucky to have me
to be your daughter.

808
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,880
I’ll take care of it.

809
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,280

Let’s go.

837
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,230
To the Palace of Flames.

838
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,550
What’s wrong with your face?

839
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,150
Maybe it’s burned by the Earth Fire.

840
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,030
You Fire Tribe’s men

841
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,360
can endure the heat the most, can’t you?

842
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,110
Maybe I haven’t been here for long.

843
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,710
Alright.

844
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,110
Just take us to the Palace of Flames.

845
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,360
Where is

846
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,070
the entrance?

847
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,920
Didn’t I tell you?

848
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,590
I’ve never been there.

849
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,920
So I don’t know

850
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,710
where is the entrance.

851
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,590
What did you say?

852
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,440
The gate of the Palace of Flames

853
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,230
was destroyed by the Earth Fire
several hundred years ago.

854
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,190
If we go there,

855
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,320
we may need to climb the mountain.

856
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,800
I know a secret pass.

857
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,230
There’s really a road here.

858
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,440
Stay close.

859
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,070
I only brought one Fire Spear.

860
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,070
Your clothes.

861
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,440
It’s so beautiful.

862
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,360
It’s glowing silk.

863
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,800
I was so afraid of darkness
when I was little,

864
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,070
my father used Yetan’s silk

865
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,800
to make the clothes

866
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,440
for us,

867
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,920
so as to help me resist

868
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
my fears of darkness.

869
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,360
Yetan?

870
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,920
Where is it?

871
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,800
In the most northern place.

872
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,070
It’s far beyond Suchuan.

873
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,320
I haven’t heard it for long that

874
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,880
someone is coming from the place.

875
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:35,960
Follow up!

876
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,960
You two.

877
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,440
You two can glow!

878
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,800
Since they two can glow,

879
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,630
you two stay close to us.

880
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,190
Exactly.

881
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,550
It’s the way.

882
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,440
It’s exactly the same
with Huotu Ke’s description.

883
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,360
Let’s go, Father.

884
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,670
When we are in the Palace of Flames,

885
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,760
you can be so helpful.

886
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,800
Let’s go.

887
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,670
So amazing.

888
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,030
Do you wear the clothes

889
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,630
all the time as you grow up?

890
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,230
Every time when we got taller,

891
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,230
Juan would

892
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,760
pull the glowing silk out carefully

893
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,320
and put it on our new clothes.

894
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,480
Xiao.

895
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,030
What’s this?

896
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,190
Huotu Xin.

897
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,550
What’s this?

898
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,710
Yeah. What’s this?

899
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,360
This is…

900
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,110
It

901
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,480
looks like the Flammable Stone.

902
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,280
But…

903
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,030
It’s the Flammable Crystal.

904
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,670
What?

905
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,670
It’s the most valuable treasure
of the Fire Tribe,

906
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,110
and the source of energy.

907
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,760
In ancient times,

908
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,400
the ancestors of the Fire Tribe

909
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,360
used the Flammable Crystals

910
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,760
to get the unparalleled power

911
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,710
of quenching stones

912
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,320
in entire Suchuan,

913
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,920
and built the brilliant

914
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,800
Jinshi City.

915
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,590
It’s the treasure in the Fire Tribe.

916
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,510
You don’t know it?

917
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,510
He is not to blame.

918
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,760
Even if in the Fire Tribe,

919
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,800
only the noble were allowed to get in

920
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,550
to the Palace of Flames.

921
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,510
Even in ancient times,

922
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,320
common people were not allowed in.

923
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,230
What… What common people?

924
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,550
Our family name is Huotu.

925
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:10,880
Our ancestor

926
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,360
is Huotu Ke, the great Founding Father
of the Fire Tribe.

927
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:18,880
Yeah.

928
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,630
So now you are in the Palace of Flames.

929
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,070
It’s also the origin
of the Earth Fire, isn’t it?

930
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,110
Only if the Flammable Crystal
is burning,

931
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,070
the Earth Fire

932
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,440
can never be put out.

933
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,000
Be careful.

934
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,320
We are at the top now.

935
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,280
The Palace of Flames should be up above.

936
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,400
We’re really in.

937
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,510
Like I said,

938
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,360
the map of Suchuan

939
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,400
is all in Yuan Yi’s head.

940
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,280
Even so, I won’t accept him.

941
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,880
I… It’s weird.

942
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,800
How come there is such a road?

943
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,150
Huotu Ke built it

944
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,840
to escape from the Palace of Flames.

945
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,110
Maybe

946
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,400
since he quenched

947
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,280
the Spirit Stone,

948
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,400
he’s foreseen the Earth Fire disaster.

949
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,190
What do you mean?

950
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,360
Just gossips.

951
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:05,670
We can talk about it later.

952
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
Going to the Palace of Flames
is more important.

953
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,320
What’s the next step?

954
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,440
Your Majesty.

955
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,440
It’s a fork here,

956
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,800
like a maze.

957
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,920
It confuses us.

958
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,920
From here,

959
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,920
I don’t know the next move, either.

960
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,440
Just take the time
to find the way slowly.

961
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,400
We can surely find it.

962
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,030
Father is right.

963
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,280
How about we separate to find it?

964
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,480
It’s faster.

965
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,840
In case

966
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,360
we can find each other,

967
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,590
Yuan Yi and I

968
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:43,510
will be waiting here for you.

969
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,960
Yin Zhuang,

970
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,110
you and my father have bracelets.

971
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,190
You can take care of each other.

972
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,400
You two are a team.

973
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,230
Go to that way.

974
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,510
Yin Xiao.

975
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,590
You go that way alone.

976
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,320
Don’t run about then.

977
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,000
What’re you looking at?

978
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,840
Let’s go.
