You’re still unrepented.

58
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,030
Do you want to die with Huotu Ke?

59
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,110
Father.

60
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,180
You know it clearly,

61
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,900
Huotu Ke was wronged.

62
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,500
I’m not your father.

63
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,260
The Yins

64
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,860
has no such a daughter as you.

65
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,470
I won’t

66
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,230
let you kill him.

67
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,500
Yin Jia.

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,820
We will always be together.

69
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,550
No.

70
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,630
I curse you.

71
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,110
I curse the Yins,

72
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,710
the Yuans.

73
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,990
I curse every one of you.

74
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,270
I swear,

75
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,540
ten years,

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,110
a hundred years,

77
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,740
or a thousand years,

78
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,420
till Suchuan is destroyed,

79
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,580
I must take revenge for Huotu Ke.

80
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,110
I must take revenge for Huotu Ke.

81
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,300
Where’s my father?

82
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,630
I’ve never hurt innocent people.

83
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,710
You saw it, didn’t you?

84
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,510
You make me dream.

85
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,180
It’s not a dream.

86
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,550
It’s my memory.

87
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,140
Where did your necklace

88
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,940
come from?

89
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,910
My mother left it to me.

90
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,420
What about yours?

91
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,470
Does it have anything to do

92
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,140
with my dream?

93
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,350
None of your business.

94
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,540
So,

95
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,190
was Huotu Ke

96
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,780
really wronged?

97
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,580
You saw it.

98
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,710
The Earth Fire trial was full of lies.

99
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,790
That’s what you want me to see.

100
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,030
How do I know if it was real or not?

101
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,990
Those are my memories

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,950
left by Huotu Ke.

103
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,780
Every bit,

104
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,380
every piece of it,

105
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,460
is an irreplaceable treasure to me.

106
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,590
It’s everything to me.

107
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,620
How dare you say it’s not real!

108
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,230
So you try to kill Yuan Yi

109
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,620
to avenge Huotu Ke’s death?

110
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,620
Yuan Tu was the real criminal.

111
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,070
In order to quench the Spirit Stone,

112
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,110
he didn’t hesitate
to ignite the Earth Fire,

113
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,990
plunging the Fire Tribe
into misery and suffering.

114
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,780
At last,

115
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,590
he and my father

116
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,070
let Huotu Ke

117
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,190
bear the blame.

118
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,620
What was the Earth Fire trial?

119
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,350
It was actually the sin

120
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,740
of the Yuans and the Yins.

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,350
But Yuan Yi isn’t Yuan Tu.

122
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,860
The descendants of the Fire Tribe

123
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,590
have been trapped

124
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,060
by Earth Fire for generations,

125
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,780
and they must

126
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,110
atone for the crime

127
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,500
that they didn’t commit.

128
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,620
We don’t fight against the Earth Fire

129
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,460
to atone for our crime.

130
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,710
That’s the glory of Fire Tribe.

131
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,780
What a surprise!

132
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,350
In the end, it’s a girl of Fire Tribe

133
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,510
that tries to defend the Yuans.

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,470
The necklace left by Huotu Ke

135
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,230
is to keep

136
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,180
the good memories

137
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,950
of you two.

138
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,950
It’s not used to carry the hatred.

139
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,700
What do you know?

140
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,180
I know a lot.

141
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,100
If Yuan Yi is killed today,

142
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,650
I must try to kill you

143
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,500
to avenge his death.

144
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,130
I won’t care if I must

145
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,260
give up my own life.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,740
However,

147
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,110
Yuan Yi certainly
doesn’t want me to do so.

148
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,420
And my father,

149
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,830
if I give up my life

150
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,710
that he has prized above

151
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,910
his own life,

152
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,070
he’ll never forgive me.

153
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,030
In the past 500 years,

154
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,590
you’ve been

155
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,910
stayed at the deserted

156
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,540
Palace of Flames alone.

157
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,510
It must be

158
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,790
more painful than death, isn’t it?

159
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,500
If Huotu Ke knew it,

160
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,380
wouldn’t he be more miserable than you?

161
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,860
If you kill Yuan Yi now

162
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,540
and shout,

163
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,900
“Huotu Ke, I’ve avenged your death!”

164
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,670
Could he hear you?

165
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,110
If you shout,

166
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,830
“I’ve cleared your name!”

167
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,310
Will people of Suchuan know it?

168
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,310
Killing Yuan Yi

169
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,180
is to vent your own hatred

170
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,940
or to clear

171
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,990
Huotu Ke’s name?

172
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,230
No.

173
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,470
It only makes you

174
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,350
a king slayer.

175
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,740
And Huotu Ke

176
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,150
was still the criminal
who ignited the Earth Fire.

177
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,230
At that time,

178
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,740
there would be no one

179
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,830
to prove his innocence.

180
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,780
But if you keep Yuan Yi alive

181
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,230
and tell him the truth,

182
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,550
he will help you

183
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,470
to absolve Huotu Ke.

184
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,470
Yuan Yi is the emperor.

185
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,780
If anyone

186
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,510
can rewrite history,

187
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,350
it must be Yuan Yi.

188
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,310
Do you want me to trust
the descendants of the Yuans?

189
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,660
Believe me.

190
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,590
Yuan Yi isn’t Yuan Tu.

191
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,060
He is a kind and upright man.

192
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,110
Then I’ll let you know

193
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,300
how many lies the Yuans told.

194
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,860
See by yourself.

195
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,660
What is this?

196
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,780
Goddess,

197
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,260
can’t you recognize the Gods?

198
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,740
They were

199
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,540
the piously worshipped Gods

200
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,470
killed by the Yuans.

201
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,860
Didn’t His Majesty tell you,

202
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,120
the day you

203
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,500
become the real Goddess

204
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,150
is the day

205
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,790
you vanish completely as a human?

206
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,500
What are you talking about?

207
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,860
Being parasitic on young girls’ bodies,

208
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,950
taking young girls’ lives,

209
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,620
could it be called Goddess?

210
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,830
You’re just a

211
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,500
human sacrifice for them.

212
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,820
You’re not even a monster.

213
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,500
It can’t be true.

214
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,830
I have the power of the Goddess.

215
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,740
I saved my father.

216
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,860
Really?

217
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,430
Did you really save your father,

218
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,190
or was it the fate of the Yuans?

219
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,790
Goddess

220
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,380
is just the Yuans’ puppet,

221
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,550
and a faithful dog.

222
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,430
Honorable God,

223
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,230
the Yuans’ chosen throne,

224
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,990
and the great dynasty

225
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,110
is based on

226
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,270
the sacrifices of

227
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,590
countless young girls like you.

228
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,260
The myth went on and on

229
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,990
until the great Emperor Yuan Tu
ascended the throne.

230
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,260
Yuan Tu feared the truth
would eventually be revealed.

231
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,150
He feared all day and couldn’t sleep.

232
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,420
Finally,

233
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,150
he made

234
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,820
the craziest decision.

235
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,110
To kill all the Gods

236
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,070
and make it a myth forever.

237
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,220
Here

238
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,500
is the place where
Yuan Tu slaughtered the Gods.

239
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,340
Only the roaring flames of Earth Fire

240
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,510
could kill you completely.

241
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,140
Earth Fire

242
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,630
rose from the slaughtering,

243
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,870
and it will last forever.

244
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,990
This is the truth of Earth Fire.

245
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,190
Isn’t it pathetic?

246
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,500
As a Goddess,

247
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,060
you’re used by the Yuans.

248
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,620
In the end,

249
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,670
you’ll be thrown away

250
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,180
like garbage.

251
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,790
Yuan Tu wouldn’t think of it himself.

252
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,780
After 500 years,

253
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,710
they eventually reappeared.

254
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,780
Again,

255
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,740
they stand in front of the Gods’ tomb.

256
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,390
The Yuans

257
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,340
built a dynasty with countless girls,

258
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,580
and covered up their lies

259
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,070
with the faith of the Fire Tribe.

260
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,390
This

261
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,020
is the truth.

262
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,990
So,

263
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,430
Goddess,

264
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,470
do you think

265
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,100
I can believe a man of the Yuans?

266
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,740
When it lights up,

267
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,190
the Fall of God in Suchuan
which has lasted for 500 years,

268
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,910
will end in my hands.

269
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,860
After that, Suchuan

270
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,950
will belong to you and me.

Listen to me.

I’m here to help you.

274
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,260
Weisheng Yan.

275
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,260
Seeing you here

276
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,020
doesn’t surprise me at all.

277
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,540
I was kind of hoping

278
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,340
to see you here.

279
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,350
Huotu Xin.

280
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,950
I’m really here to help you.

281
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,710
Don’t hurt me.

282
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,950
Drop the act.

283
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,150
You know I can’t

284
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,110
do you any harm.

285
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,420
But I can see anger

286
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,310
in your eyes.

287
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,700
Where’s Linglong?

288
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,470
Linglong?

289
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,060
Yin Jia is taking care of her.

290
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,060
Weisheng Yan,

291
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,470
tell me.

292
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,580
How can I rescue Linglong?

293
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,230
I’m begging you.

294
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,060
I’ve fought with you.

295
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,260
I know I’m no match for you.

296
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,870
I don’t want to be your opponent.

297
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,470
As long as you can save Linglong,

298
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,740
I’ll do whatever you ask me to do.

299
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,790
It’s too late.

300
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,390
It’s not.

301
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,030
The secret here can

302
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,260
make one live for 500 years.

303
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,230
I’m sure it can save Linglong, too.

304
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,430
Right?

305
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,540
So you want to do business with me.

306
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,740
But you don’t have any capital.

307
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,550
I…

308
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,340
I can take Linglong away

309
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,950
from Fire Tribe,

310
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,060
and from Suchuan.

311
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,420
Don’t you want Zhaodu?

312
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,300
I’ll take Yuan Yi away, too.

313
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,230
He’ll listen to Linglong.

314
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,340
Weisheng Yan,

315
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,300
you can take everything you want.

316
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,300
I only want Linglong.

317
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,340
Huotu Xin.

318
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,500
You were a tough man who didn’t give in

319
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,430
to Zhu Xi’s cruel torture.

320
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,950
What happened to you?

321
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,300
I…

322
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,820
I can’t save my daughter.

323
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,390
I can’t…

324
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,910
I can’t let Linglong become a monster.

325
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,990
You mean Jin’er, don’t you?

326
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,790
Well,

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,740
Jin’er listened to me at the beginning

328
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,740
and went to Fire Tribe.

329
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,510
Because she knew

330
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,380
only the Palace of Flames
had a way to save her.

331
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,230
Who was Jin’er actually?

332
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,110
Did she

333
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,540
have anything to do with you
or with the secret here?

334
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,630
Whoever she was,

335
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,950
whatever she would do,

336
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,780
it doesn’t matter anymore,

337
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,860
does it?

338
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,390
She was dead.

339
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,990
But fortunately,

340
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,590
she left a daughter

341
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,940
in the world.

342
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,740
Linglong.

343
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,590
She goes even further

344
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,020
than her own mother.

345
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,740
Did you see?

346
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,230
Jin’er’s appearance.

347
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,780
Isn’t Linglong like her very much?

348
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,910
I’m begging you.

349
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,620
Look.

350
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,390
I’ve never been your opponent.

351
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,350
The reason Wu Yuan

352
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,540
brought you here this time

353
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,260
is because only Yin Jia

354
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,580
can save Linglong.

355
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,860
Didn’t Wu Yuan tell you?

356
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,950
I’ve been helping you.

357
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,310
Weisheng Yan, you know it.

358
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,500
I don’t believe

359
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,620
every word you said.

360
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,100
But,

361
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,270
only you can save Linglong.

362
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,470
So it doesn’t matter.

363
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,260
I don’t care even if you let me

364
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,790
work like a horse.

365
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,500
Whatever you let me do,

366
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,670
as long as you can kill

367
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,070
the monster in Linglong’s body

368
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,500
and give her back to me,

369
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,940
I’ll listen to you.

370
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,670
It’s a deal then?

371
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,030
Actually, as for Jin’er’s death,

372
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,190
I blamed myself, too.

373
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,870
I don’t want Linglong

374
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,110
to repeat her mother’s tragedy.

375
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,350
This place isn’t good for walking.

376
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,780
What did you say just now?

377
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,710
You would do anything for me,
wouldn’t you?

378
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,590
Why don’t you help me

379
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,500
pave a trail first?

380
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,850
♪Paint a picture of spring♪

381
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,240
♪Fragrant flowers fall to the ground♪

382
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,230

Oh, by the way,

404
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,430
stay away from Yin Zhuang
from now on.

405
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,540
Except for Yin Zhuang,

406
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,230
I don’t need you to do anything.

407
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,190
You’re useless to me.

408
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,950
I keep you alive,

409
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,630
but you don’t appreciate it.

410
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,580
I’ll never leave Yin Zhuang.

411
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,430
The body works very well.

412
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,500
I don’t want to give it back to you yet.

413
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,870
Then I’ll stay here

414
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,710
for the rest of my life.

415
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,950
What did you say?

416
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,100
Say it again.

417
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,030
I said,

418
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,500
I’ll stay here

419
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,260
for the rest of my life.

420
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,950
I’ll remain at my sister’s side.

421
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,140
I’ll try every means

422
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,020
to drag you out of

423
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,670
Yin Zhuang’s body.

424
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,150
Even if

425
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,870
I become a ghost

426
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,140
like you.

427
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,110
Xiao.

428
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,910
Xiao, don’t.

429
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,300
Xiao, forget about me.

430
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,390
Yin Zhuang.

431
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,100
It was so touching.

432
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,470
It gives me pain

433
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,900
not to let your sister hear it.

434
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,820
But your sister fully

435
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,500
focuses on the Fire Tribe man.

436
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,230
Even if I give her back to you,

437
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,990
one day,

438
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,740
she’ll still leave you.

439
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,310
Can you bear it?

440
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,820
But I can

441
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,100
let you and your sister

442
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,460
be together forever.

443
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,500
Do you want to see

444
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,470
Yin Zhuang’s body?

445
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,500
Stop it!

446
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,060
Get the hell out of her body!

447
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,630
Xiao.

448
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:52,950
Xiao.

449
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,350
What happened?

450
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:54,940
Xiao.

451
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,260
Yin Zhuang.

452
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,580
I…

453
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,990
Can you still slap her?

454
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,020
I’m begging you.

455
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,430
Don’t do this to her.

456
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,060
Help me,

457
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,660
and I’ll let you and your sister

458
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,110
be together forever.

459
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,950
Linglong.

460
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:07,910
Linglong.

461
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,270
Father.

462
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,070
Are you all right?

463
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,180
Did the strange woman do anything…

464
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,020
Why is your face so dirty?

465
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,020
I…

466
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,740
I’m fine.

467
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:20,910
I’m fine, too.

468
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,260
I’m very well.

469
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,710
You…

470
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,260
Why are you here?

471
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,150
When I was born,

472
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,820
it was shining, wasn’t it?

473
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,100
It’s called Pillar of Eternity.

474
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,550
There is another one in Zhaodu.

475
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,540
But it’s bigger than this one.

476
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,830
Yuan Yi said,

477
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,020
through the pillar, Goddess shows

478
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,500
its divine power to Suchuan.

479
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,990
If I turn into Goddess now,

480
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,910
it must shine.

481
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:54,950
Linglong,

482
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,910
there’s one thing

483
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,740
I must tell you.

484
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,260
I know.

485
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,270
All the time,

486
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,070
I’ve been trying to prove

487
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,900
my mother wasn’t a monster.

488
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,710
Me neither.

489
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,430
Do you know, Father?

490
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,340
Yuan Yi is like

491
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,020
a beam of light

492
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,540
that comes into my life.

493
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,780
I left Fire Tribe

494
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,110
for Zhaodu.

495
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,230
I tried my best to be Goddess.

496
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,270
Because I want everyone to know

497
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,580
what Yuan Yi said was true.

498
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,300
But in the end,

499
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,540
I’m still a monster.

500
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:48,990
No.

501
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,230
Linglong,

502
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,340
you’re not.

503
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,460
That night on the fish boat,

504
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,660
Yuan Yi told you all of it, didn’t he?

505
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,060
I wonder why he is so weird

506
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,780
recently.

507
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,620
He must want to tell me these, too.

508
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,390
Father, you did a great job this time.

509
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,500
You didn’t try to take me away

510
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,140
or go to beat Yuan Yi

511
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,910
in a rage.

512
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,780
You trust us.

513
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,950
It makes me happy.

514
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,190
Thanks, Father.

515
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,670
Don’t worry.

516
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,270
I will find a way.

517
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,430
I will.

518
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,900
I have an idea.

519
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,060
I have an idea

520
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,260
to bring Yin Zhuang back

521
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,230
as well as to save Yuan Yi.

522
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,790
What’s that?

523
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,340
Yin Jia is in

524
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,430
the necklace around her neck.

525
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,270
Yin Jia.

526
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,790
This is Memory Crystal.

527
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,860
It can keep all your

528
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,830
good memories.

529
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,830
Even if Heaven rends asunder
and Earth cracks,

530
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,790
everything is destroyed,

531
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,620
or we were both gone,

532
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,310
our good memories kept in it

533
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,060
will last forever.

534
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,620
Forever?

535
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,260
It

536
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,620
is our eternity.

537
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,700
Yin Jia.

538
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,390
Weisheng Yan.

539
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,020
Haven’t you left?

540
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,710
I have a present

541
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,380
that I forgot to give you.

542
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,590
I don’t need it.

543
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,870
The necklace around your neck

544
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,190
is too old.

545
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,470
It’s not secure.

546
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,030
You will go out of

547
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,740
the Palace of Flames in the future.

548
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,110
In case anything unexpected happened,

549
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,470
even the Memory Crystal isn’t lost,

550
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,620
it may fall to the ground.

551
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,220
It’s not good to get it bumped.

552
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,310
This necklace

553
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,710
is made of the best

554
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,820
hard gold in Suchuan.

555
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,820
It is anti-fire-and-water.

556
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,830
It can’t be broken by
hard metal and stone.

557
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,060
It not only represents
my good intention,

558
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,060
but could also help you

559
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,220
to protect the great

560
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,460
Memory Crystal.

561
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,580
Then come and put it on me.

562
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,500
Yes.

563
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,220
As the treasure of Fire Tribe,

564
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,820
the Memory Crystal was only

565
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,350
used to keep some memories.

566
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,710
But you actually use it to

567
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,820
keep your consciousness

568
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,910
in order to make yourself immortal.

569
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,140
It’s astonishing.

570
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,430
The power of consciousness

571
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,710
is the only thing of the Yins

572
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,100
that is valuable to me.

573
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,990
Unfortunately,

574
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,470
the Yins had lost

575
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,140
the great power in the end.

576
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,500
It’s retribution.

577
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,790
Yin Jia isn’t a ghost.

578
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,190
She is kind of some

579
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,620
memory

580
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,740
or consciousness in the necklace.

581
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,540
What do you mean?

582
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,430
I don’t know why,

583
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,830
but I’m sure,

584
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,870
if you destroy Yin Jia’s necklace,

585
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,470
you can save Yin Zhuang.

586
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,740
Do you remember?

587
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,990
Yeah.

588
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,180
Go to save her now.

589
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,060
Yin Zhuang is waiting for you.

590
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,710
Well, where’re you going?

591
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,860
Yuan Yi is waiting for me, too.

592
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,580
I just saw

593
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,430
you played tricks on Yin Xiao.

594
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,100
Although it was interesting,

595
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,100
it was a little frivolous

596
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,350
of you to do that.

597
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,060
Aren’t you happy?

598
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,910
After all, you’re using
Yin Zhuang’s body.

599
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,910
I don’t care.

600
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,950
The body

601
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,110
is not mine.

602
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,390
It’s just

603
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,180

604
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,060

everything is destroyed,
