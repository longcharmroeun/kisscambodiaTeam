<i>Episode 15</i>

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,590
It’s time.

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,590
Or

26
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,150
I should send you off Zhaodu first.

27
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,630
After all, we don’t have enough

28
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,240
forces in Zhaodu.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,150
What if…?

30
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,030
Though we have few forces in Zhaodu,

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,630
we have a friend.

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,710
However,

33
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,430
he hasn’t agreed to work with us.

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,470
When he received my gift,

35
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,840
he’ll definitely agree.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,080
Let’s see

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,710
how powerful the Earth Fire will be

38
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,280
after it breaks through the Wall.

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,310
Xiao.

40
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,240
What’s that?

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,310
It’s Moon Guards’ flame path.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,470
Moon Guards

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
are isolated in the Abyss.

44
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,630
Though they’ve stepped away
from the harassment on land,

45
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,800
they still need to be cautious
of the Evil Souls.

46
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,240
When it gets dark,

47
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,310
they’ll ignite two flame paths

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,120
to keep away from the Evil Souls.

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,400
No.

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,910
I know what they’re going to do.

51
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,840
Actually Zhu Xi doesn’t have any forces.

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,560
All these

53
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,680
are their cover.

54
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,710
What do you mean?

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,310
Zhu Xi

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,240
let you go to Zhaodu to
give the information on purpose.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,310
The fish boat army is a cover.

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,150
The real purpose is to

59
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,680
transfer all Fei Tian’s

60
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,310
Moon Guards from Zhaodu.

61
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,000
Transfer them from Zhaodu?

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
As everyone knows,

63
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,360
to get Zhaodu,

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,430
you must get rid of the Moon Guards.

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
It’s not safe here.

66
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,280
Go!

67
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,360
Yin Zhuang.

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,070
Go.

69
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,720
It’s the same with
that of the Earth Fire.

70
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,240
Flammable Stones.

71
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
They’re from the Fire Tribe.

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,750
Weisheng Yan.

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,270
Chief Priest,

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,430
it’s all done.

75
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,750
Where do you put them in?

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,870
Tianqi Cemetery.

77
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
We must make sure Zhu Xi can’t

78
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,360
find Goddess.

79
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,680
Yes.

80
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
To save Goddess,

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,430
it’s time for us

82
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,390
to be bad guys.

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,240
Your Majesty.

84
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:53,720
Quick.

85
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,830
Send His Majesty in.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
What’s going on?

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,630
The Moon Guards’ castles around Zhaodu

88
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,510
have all been destroyed.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,510
Our tribesmen

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
have mostly died.

91
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,310
Send all people out

92
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,920
to save them in all efforts!

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,310
No injured ones shall be left behind!

94
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,720
Yes!

95
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,240
Wait!

96
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,000
Your job is

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,920
to save His Majesty

98
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,000
and the capital city.

99
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,190
Fei Tian!

100
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,070
I see.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
You can be relieved, Minister Fei.

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,430
Now

103
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,000
no matter how many Moon Guards’ feathers

104
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,630
have been on fire,

105
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
I shall set on the same number of

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,070
fires of revenge to Pingting!

107
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,390
Zhu Xi.

108
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,310
It’s my vow of the revenge

109
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,270
on you!

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,750
It’s quiet in Zhaodu.

111
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,680
So weird.

112
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,630
Yin Zhuang.

113
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,750
Wait for us on the boat.

114
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,950
But…

115
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,750
It’s fine.

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
It will protect me.

117
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,160
Huotu.

118
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,600
Xia Ling?

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,360
This way.

120
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,920
This way.

121
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,040
How would you be here?

122
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,360
It’s a long story.

123
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,830
Huotu, Ling…

124
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,430
It doesn’t matter. Go ahead.

125
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,950
Linglong was caught by them.

126
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,480
Where’s she now?

127
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,680
I’ll take you there.

128
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,270
Okay.

129
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,390
Go.

130
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,920
Something bad may also happen
to His Majesty.

131
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,480
We can meet in the hall directly.

132
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,430
Be careful.

133
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,390
Let’s go.

134
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,390
Did Zhu Xi take you here?

135
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,630
Did they make things difficult
for our tribesmen?

136
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,320
No.

137
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,150
It’s me.

138
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,630
I wanted to be the hero

139
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,200
to kill the monster

140
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,270
for the tribesmen.

141
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,120
She’s left the Fire Tribe.

142
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,240
Why can’t you let her go?

143
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,480
It’s my fault.

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
But I saw it clearly.

145
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,790
Linglong is indeed the Goddess.

146
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,390
Huotu, let’s go.

147
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,960
It’s here.

148
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,550
Linglong was kept inside.

149
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,840
Why didn’t you tell His Majesty?

150
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,510
People here seem to respect Goddess.

151
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,270
But they try to hurt her secretly.

152
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:21,960
Linglong?

153
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,550
Linglong?

154
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
Linglong?

155
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,120
Father!

156
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,510
Linglong?

157
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,000
Linglong?

158
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,670
Linglong?

159
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,240
Father!

160
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,510
Father, I’m Linglong!

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,910
I’m here!

162
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,600
Father!

163
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,200
Linglong!

164
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:58,910
Father!

165
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,750
Don’t worry.

166
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,390
I’ll get you out soon!

167
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,200
Father!

168
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,030
Linglong!

169
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,630
Step back!

170
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,670
Father.

171
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,910
Father.

172
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,000
Father.

173
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,000
It’s alright.

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,870
It’s alright. It’s alright.

175
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,200
You hold me too tight.

176
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,390
I am almost strangled to death.

177
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,960
Father.

178
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,270
It’s such a thick wall.

179
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,320
Father.

180
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,910
It’s my fault.

181
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,120
It’s your fault?

182
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
Why is it your fault?

183
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,840
I will never leave you again.

184
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
You don’t know.

185
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,120
I feel proud of you.

186
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,600
When I was in Pingting,

187
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,630
so many people were following behind me,

188
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,790
trying to flatter me.

189
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,440
They even wished me to be their father.

190
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,750
Nonsense!

191
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,790
Alright.

192
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,750
It’s alright.

193
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,630
It’s too dangerous here.

194
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,320
We should leave quickly.

195
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,630
Father.

196
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,120
I can’t run away now.

197
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,720
I can’t leave Yuan Yi

198
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,630
alone here.

199
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,320
Do you think

200
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,360
I’m here to take you to run way?

201
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
I have

202
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,790
no more wishes this life,

203
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,320
I only want you to live

204
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,510
a healthy and happy life.

205
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,600
I didn’t want you to leave before,

206
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,510
because I’m afraid in this big world,

207
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,200
I can’t protect you.

208
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
But now,

209
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,480
you’ve grown up.

210
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,000
You know what you want to do.

211
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,320
I

212
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,120
can’t protect you forever.

213
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,120
But at least now,

214
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,870
look,

215
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,000
am I powerful again?

216
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,000
Such a thick wall.

217
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,270
I entered through it.

218
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,150
Alright. Alright.

219
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,960
It’s okay.

220
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,030
Go.

221
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,320
Huotu!

222
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,720
Linglong.

223
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,200
Xia Ling.

224
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,080
They found us.

225
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,910
We need to leave now.

226
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,480
Okay.

227
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,030
Go.

228
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,240
This is…

229
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,550
He had been careless.

230
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,320
So I took the chance.

231
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,480
It’s these people

232
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,440
who deluded me to Zhaodu

233
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,000
to identify Linglong as a monster.

234
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,440
I…

235
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,080
Never mind.

236
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,200
It’s gone.

237
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,790
Zhu Xi’s men have taken actions.

238
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,670
Is it Zhu Xi who kept you here?

239
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,270
I don’t think so.

240
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,790
It’s Tianqi Cemetery.

241
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,910
I think it’s Chief Priest
who hid me here.

242
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,480
But he will not hurt me.

243
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,630
So he’s trying to protect me.

244
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,550
But it’s unnecessary.

245
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,360
Zhu Xi won’t be able to

246
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,720
make trouble in Zhaodu.

247
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,550
Linglong,

248
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,670
Fei Tian’s Moon Guards

249
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,200
have been all injured.

250
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,960
What?

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,870
Zhu Xi’s men

252
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,550
will attack Zhaodu in any minute.

253
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,630
So Chief Priest hid me

254
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,720
first.

255
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,240
He must have known

256
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,360
Zhu Xi’s plan.

257
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,550
Can it be that

258
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,360
Zhu Xi and Chief Priest

259
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,510
are a team?

260
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,720
They did it together?

261
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,270
It’s impossible.

262
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,480
Chief Priest won’t kill me.

263
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,440
He won’t hurt Yuan Yi, either.

264
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Moon Guards…

265
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,910
They’re going to kill Fei Tian!

266
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,600
Minister Fei.

267
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,390
Minister Fei.

268
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,670
Run!

269
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,000
The Moon Tribe held His Majesty!

270
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,790
Fei Tian was trying to kill the Goddess!

271
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
The evidence is conclusive!

272
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,870
The treason crime is unforgivable!

273
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,270
All Moon Tribe’s men

274
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,910
shall die!

275
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,910
Chief Priest,

276
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,360
are you insane?

277
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,630
Your Majesty,

278
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,510
you can sentence me later.

279
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,270
But today,

280
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,240
I’d rather give my life

281
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,120
to wipe out the criminals.

282
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,670
I should have figured it out.

283
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,790
To wipe me out,

284
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,550
you’re even willing to work with Zhu Xi.

285
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,750
Fei Tian.

286
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,080
It’s your death day.

287
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,910
You?

288
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,600
What are you doing?

289
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,750
You want to rebel?

290
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,600
The Moon Tribe plots treason!

291
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,150
Fei Tian shall be sentenced to death!

292
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,270
Protect His Majesty!

293
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,840
Fei Tian is arbitrary and domineering,

294
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,750
and blasphemes Goddess!

295
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,870
She’s committed a death crime!

296
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,870
People in the city all want
to kill her tribesmen.

297
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,000
Now the Goddess comes again.

298
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,270
Whoever kills her

299
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,120
will get the Goddess's redemption!

300
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,360
Who dares?

301
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,000
Yin Xiao.

302
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:53,960
Go!

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,670
Fei Tian, go!

304
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,790
They will not make it hard on me.

305
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,960
But losing you

306
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,390
will be my real desperate plight.

307
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,830
We can’t let Fei Tian go!

308
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,400
It’s been a long time.

309
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,000
Minister Fei.

310
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,680
It’s

311
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,400
you.

312
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,920
You never expected that
I can still fly, right?

313
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,350
Fei Tian.

314
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,240
Fei Tian.

315
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,590
Fei Tian.

316
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,110
No.

317
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,790
Your Majesty.

318
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,550
Someone!

319
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,920
Someone!

320
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,000
Yuan Yi.

321
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,030
Yuan Yi.

322
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,830
Your Majesty.

323
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,480
You can

324
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
become a

325
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,550
res...

326
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,750
pectable

327
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,960
emperor.

328
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,000
I’m so proud of it.

329
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,880
No.

330
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,680
Don’t say this.

331
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,830
Hold on.

332
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Hold on.

333
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,160
Linglong.

334
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,200
Here.

335
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,640
I’m here.

336
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,550
Go.

337
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,400
Take His Majesty away.

338
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,310
Promise me

339
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,920
to take good care

340
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,750
of His Majesty.

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,350
I can save you.

342
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,110
Wait a minute.

343
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,480
Your Majesty.

344
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,830
Protect yourself well.

345
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,640
Fei Tian.

346
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,830
Fei Tian, I can save you.

347
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,880
Sword.

348
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,400
Do you have a sword?

349
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,270
Yuan Yi.

350
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,310
Stab me, Yuan Yi.

351
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,270
Yuan Yi!

352
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,240
What’re you doing?

353
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,590
What are you doing?

354
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,750
I need to save Fei Tian.

355
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,200
Why stab you with a sword?

356
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,310
-I’ll explain it later.
-Are you crazy?

357
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,030
No!

358
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,310
-I won’t listen! It’s late!
-Explain to me first!

359
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:33,790
Father!

360
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,400
-I want to save Fei Tian!
-No!

361
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,960
Explain to me first!

362
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
-Enough!
-Father!

363
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,070
I can save…

364
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,960
Fei Tian!

Moon Guards!

Surrender yourselves!

Yuan Yi. What are you going to do?

370
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,680
Don’t stop me.

371
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,750
Don’t be impulsive.

372
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,790
Let’s go first!

373
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,880
I won’t leave.

374
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,440
Calm down.

375
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,680
I won’t leave Zhaodu!

376
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,510
Listen.

377
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,110
If you are controlled by Zhu Xi,

378
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,440
who can exonerate the crime

379
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,160
for the Moon Tribe?

380
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,000
You want Fei Tian

381
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
to bear the accusation of treason

382
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,960
in the record?

383
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,510
The Moon Guards safeguard Zhaodu

384
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,270
and protect you.

385
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,750
But they’ll be called traitors

386
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,240
and cursed by posterity after they die.

387
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,200
If you insist on staying in Zhaodu,

388
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,310
the sacrifice the Guards make

389
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,830
will truly become a joke.

390
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,310
In the name of Goddess, I promise

391
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,880
we will be back.

392
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,550
Protect the Goddess!

393
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,310
Bring His Majesty back!

394
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,270
Linglong,

395
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,030
go.

396
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,350
What’s wrong?

397
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,960
Surprise?

398
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,070
I’ve told you.

399
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,070
Don’t touch

400
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,720
my man.

401
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,110
Father!

402
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,200
Go.

403
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,270
Get on the boat.

404
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,640
Fei Tian

405
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,480
finally can be with Master Fozhuan.

406
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,070
Don’t follow him!

407
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,160
Maybe

408
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,350
he just wants to cry alone

409
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,200
and don’t want us to see it.

410
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,790
The top priority

411
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,960
is to discuss

412
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
where to go next.

413
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,640
It’s not a solution

414
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,960
to keep flying here.

415
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,440
Yeah.

416
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,830
I’ve promised Fei Tian

417
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,110
to guard Yuan Yi for her.

418
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,000
When Yuan Yi comes out,

419
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,000
we need to prepare

420
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
a complete plan for him.

421
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,240
Alright.

422
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,480
Let’s discuss

423
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,590
the plan.

424
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,400
Before that,

425
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,030
we need her to tell us the truth.

426
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,880
Huotu Xin.

427
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,110
I saved

428
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,200
you and your daughter again.

429
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,310
What’re you doing, Huotu Xin?

430
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,880
If she’s not willing to tell the truth,

431
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,720
it’s useless even if you kill her.

432
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,440
You think you know me well?

433
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,920
What the heck do you know?

434
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I didn’t say I want to know you.

435
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,310
If you still won’t tell us the truth,

436
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
you have no more chance to talk.

437
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,200
You like the truth that much?

438
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Then your sister

439
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,480
does marry the right one.

440
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,240
Miss Wu Yuan,

441
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,310
if your grandfather knows

442
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,030
you are serving Weisheng Yan

443
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,790
for him,

444
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,550
he must feel uneasy.

445
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,400
I was the same, too.

446
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,640
I was so stupid before.

447
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,510
If I sacrifice myself to ask

448
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,400
Weisheng Yan to support my brother,

449
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,310
in the end,

450
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,920
it must bring misery to us all.

451
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
So I’ve made up my mind

452
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
that I must leave Weisheng Yan

453
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,880
to live my own life.

454
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,750
I hope

455
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,550
you can also leave him.

456
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,550
Even if I tell you,

457
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,480
do you know if it’s true or not?

458
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,160
Because you can only tell us the truth.

459
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,960
Why?

460
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,830
I remember when we were
in the Fire Tribe,

461
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,480
you said

462
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,440
you wanted to keep me to make a deal.

463
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,000
My father told me

464
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,440
you did that to save your grandfather.

465
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,590
But whatever Weisheng Yan

466
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,720
is plotting,

467
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,550
it can’t be a favor to me.

468
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,070
But I

469
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,270
am the one
who can save your grandfather.

470
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,720
If I’m willing to help you,

471
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,880
you must be able to
make a choice easily, right?

472
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah.

473
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,030
We’re different from
Weisheng Yan, right?

474
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,750
At least we wish your grandfather
to be good.

475
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,830
You’re different from Weisheng Yan.

476
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,590
If you were at least half cruel as him,

477
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,200
will you

478
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,110
be in this situation?

479
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,680
You remember how to use it?

480
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,030
I’m tired.

481
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,720
I’ll go to sleep first

482
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,510
before reconsidering it.

483
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,550
Well.

484
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,270
His Majesty

485
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,750
is not so well right now.

486
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,960
If something bad happens to him,

487
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,240
you must be blamed for it.

488
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,200
You know what?

489
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,750
This time my father

490
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,310
didn’t ask to take me away.

491
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
He promised that

492
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,760
he will find the evidence

493
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,920
of Zhu Xi’s rebellion

494
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,070
and help me complete

495
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,550
what I want to do.

496
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,070
He said for these years,

497
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,760
he’s the only one coming out
of the Fire Tribe.

498
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,880
He can’t embarrass our tribesmen.

499
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
If it’s not that you took us out,

500
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,710
which allowed him

501
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,070
and I

502
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,360
to have experienced all these,

503
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,670
he may never

504
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,920
say that.

505
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,030
Actually me too.

506
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,670
Before,

507
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,190
I always tried to

508
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,320
get more recognition from others.

509
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,550
But if you didn’t take me
to experience this,

510
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,320
I may never know that

511
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,710
even if all are denying me,

512
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,030
I can still be happy.

513
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,510
I’m so happy that

514
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,190
I can be by your side.

515
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,670
You’re back.

516
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,190
You don’t allow others to disturb him,

517
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,320
but you can’t help to do so.

518
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,760
If Yin Zhuang knows that,

519
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,000
she must laugh at you.

520
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,510
How is he?

521
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,230
Yuan Yi?

522
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,150
Why are you here?

523
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,590
Where’s Linglong?

524
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,280
You can take her away.

525
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,590
What did you say?

526
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,030
Now Zhaodu has been occupied,

527
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,440
I’m in exile with the emperor.

528
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,150
Zhu Xi must tell others

529
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,360
we are traitors.

530
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,150
Do you want me to go back
to the Bright Moon Island?

531
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,800
You can always figure
out what I’m thinking.

532
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,280
Sure.

533
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,880
We are related after all.

534
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,000
But I

535
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,190
never know

536
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,550
what you’re thinking.

537
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,590
So I make you

538
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,000
suffer a lot.

539
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,230
Xiao.

540
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,320
You’ve changed.

541
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,510
What?

542
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,190
Now you’re willing to show weakness.

543
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,440
You’re trying to ask me

544
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,630
my true feelings, aren’t you?

545
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,480
You don’t want

546
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,360
me to feel wronged for you anymore.

547
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,320
Right?

548
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,030
Yes.

549
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,760
I don’t want to guess it anymore.

550
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,630
Xiao.

551
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,480
I told you.

552
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,510
No matter I choose to
get married or run away,

553
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,230
it’s all my choice.

554
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,110
So later on,

555
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,230
whatever you do,

556
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,590
don’t push me away,

557
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,070
or

558
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,230
treat me scrupulously.

559
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,150
The future path

560
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,840
will be so hard.

561
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,630
So you mean

562
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,960
Linglong

563
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,070
will be assimilated

564
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,280
by the Goddess?

565
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,150
If she gets more mature,

566
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,400
in the end,

567
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,230
she will lose herself.

568
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,800
It’s like

569
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,440
she’s eaten by the Goddess.

570
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,920
It’s different.

571
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,880
What’s the difference?

572
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,590
Does

573
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,150
Linglong know?

574
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,190
When I know it, it’s too late.

575
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,800
I don’t expect your forgiveness.

576
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,190
But please trust me.

577
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,030
I don’t want to lose her, either.

578
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,110
You don’t

579
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,920
want your Zhaodu?

580
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,590
I won’t trade it with Linglong.

581
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,030
Brat.

582
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,550
It’s rare that we can get along well.

583
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,360
So,

584
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,070
do you have any solutions?

585
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,190
Not yet.

586
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,710
But she can’t transform anymore.

587
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:24,800
Or else…!

588
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,670
Do you know

589
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,190
till now,

590
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,510
Linglong has been

591
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,960
trying to figure some ways

592
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,030
to help you take Zhaodu back?

593
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,670
She’s doing everything to help you.

594
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,030
So,

595
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,880
should you

596
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,920
repay her in the same way?

597
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,150
I will.

598
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,070
Brat,

599
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,440
at that time,

600
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,710
you coaxed her out.

601
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,960
Now you can’t throw her back to me.

602
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,840
Be a man.

603
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,230
Take your responsibility.

604
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,590
Think it well

605
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,960
about how to tell her.

606
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,280
Remember

607
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,400
not to make her sad.

608
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
You’re telling me this. Does it mean

609
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,480
that you’re committing her to me?

610
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,000
You bastard!

611
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,110
What’re you thinking?

612
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,030
Well.

613
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,360
What are you doing?

614
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:55,760
We…

615
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,230
I told you to take care of your wound.

616
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,360
How can you even beat him?

617
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,320
-I…
-You even bully him.

618
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,320
I didn’t.

619
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,000
No.

620
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,110
You fell down yourself?

621
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,110
Yeah.

622
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,760
No.

623
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,920
Does it hurt?

624
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,400
Never mind.

625
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,960
Let me check.

626
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,880
I’m fine.

627
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,320
It doesn’t hurt.

628
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,150
I just applied the medicine.

629
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,920
Huotu Xin.

630
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,960
I’ve known that.

631
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,480
What were you arguing for exactly?

632
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,110
I thought

633
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,590
you were going to

634
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,440
cry alone.

635
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,920
Sorry to keep you worried.

636
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:52,880
I’m okay.

637
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,440
Have you figured it out?

638
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,760
What’s your plan?

639
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,070
Actually we have discussed it.

640
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
We weren’t discouraged.

641
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,110
We’ve decided

642
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,510
to find the evidence of Zhu Xi

643
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,230
and Chief Priest’s rebellion first.

644
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,150
And then…

645
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:11,960
Well.

646
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,070
I’ll also try hard

647
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,440
to learn how to control Goddess's power.

648
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,710
Goddess and the emperor

649
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,230
are destined

650
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,960
to fight together.

651
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,590
So,

652
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,630
don’t worry.

653
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,190
I will never lose you.

654
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,070
Why

655
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:44,760
are you

656
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,230
suddenly…?

657
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,710
Father.

658
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:57,880
What’re you doing?

659
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,280
I…

660
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:00,670
What are you doing?

661
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,960
I’m serious.

662
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,960
Aren’t you having a headache?
