<i>Episode 17</i>

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,920
Here,

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,150
we must take care.

26
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,950
Come on.

27
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,470
What… What is up?

28
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,230
Nothing.

29
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,840
Take care.

30
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,640
Yin Zhuang.

31
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,310
I recommend

32
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,200
we touch the bracelets.

33
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,310
It is very dangerous here.

34
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,350
They can protect us

35
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,870
if the Earth Fire rushes in later.

36
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,310
Okay.

37
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,790
I…

38
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,000
suddenly

39
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,680
feel like pissing.

40
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,800
Okay.

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
Just wait for me here.

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Don’t go away.

43
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,430
Yin Zhuang.

44
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,520
Yin Zhuang.

45
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,680
Yin Zhuang?

46
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,390
Wu Yuan?

47
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,070
Why are you here?

48
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,950
Did you see Yin Zhuang?

49
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,190
They have found the entrance.

50
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,720
Yin Zhuang is waiting for us in there.

51
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,510
Let’s enter right away.

52
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,510
Welcome back

53
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,310
to the world of mortals.

54
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,390
What’s up?

55
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,830
Are you lost?

56
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
Yin Zhuang?

57
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,630
How did you like the meal yesterday?

58
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,110
I didn’t eat it.

59
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,150
Why don’t you acknowledge it

60
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,720
if you ate it?

61
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,800
Okay.

62
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,720
You didn’t eat it.

63
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,120
Let me tell you a secret.

64
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,150
That meal was personally

65
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,150
cooked by Yin Zhuang for you.

66
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,720
Remember to thank her later.

67
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,040
Okay.

68
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,240
I know Yin Xiao

69
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,320
was a little too harsh on you before.

70
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,390
But you are also to blame for it.

71
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,000
You shouldn’t have kept offending him.

72
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,000
But it is his fault
to leave you this time.

73
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,000
We have blamed him

74
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,870
and Yin Zhuang has blamed him too.

75
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,510
Forget it.

76
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,870
I don’t care anyway.

77
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,750
When you meet him again,

78
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,480
talk to him peacefully.

79
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,560
Yin Zhuang.

80
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,070
Whose dress is it?

81
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,360
It is my dress.

82
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,670
But,

83
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you were wearing another one.

84
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,360
Linglong,

85
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,350
she is a little strange.

86
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,950
Are you scared, Your Majesty?

87
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,000
Scared of me

88
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,870
or this place?

89
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,960
Goddess is enough to protect you

90
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,270
even if she is half as mighty.

91
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,120
Don’t be scared.

92
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,440
Yin Zhuang,

93
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
are you kidding me?

94
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,840
Kidding you?

95
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,710
Of course not.

96
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,520
I am lauding you.

97
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,280
I have never seen

98
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,280
a girl with such a perfect combo

99
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,590
of body and soul

100
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,960
in the past centuries.

101
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,630
You are almost comparable

102
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,360
with the God of Emperor Yuan Tu.

103
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
But

104
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,800
why is the Goddess in your body

105
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,040
suppressed?

106
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,750
Are you

107
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,560
afraid of its power?

108
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,510
You have many secrets

109
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,600
on you.

110
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,790
That is why we came to

111
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,670
the Palace of Flames for an answer.

112
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,470
Do you forget it?

113
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,360
Answer?

114
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,560
I wonder
how Your Majesty thinks about it.

115
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,070
Yin Zhuang,

116
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
what nonsense are you talking about?

117
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,030
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

118
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,720
It is up to you

119
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
how to treat your own Goddess.

120
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,030
I am sorry for that.

121
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,080
What is wrong with you?

122
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,030
I don’t quite understand

123
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,080
what you talked about just now.

124
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,000
Where is my father?

125
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
Why are you alone?

126
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,830
Go towards the fire.

127
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,350
Your father is waiting for you

128
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,870
at the Palace of Flames.

129
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,440
Where are they?

130
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,360
Linglong?

131
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,480
Linglong?

132
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,480
Yuan Yi?

133
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,510
Linglong?

134
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,560
Where are they?

135
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,840
I have come with you all the way here.

136
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,790
How can I know it?

137
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,720
Er…

138
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,870
Where is Yin Zhuang?

139
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,240
Yin Zhuang.

140
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,630
Yin Zhuang!

141
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,430
Yin Zhuang!

142
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,600
Yin Zhuang!

143
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,870
Yin Zhuang!

144
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,150
Why did you change your clothes?

145
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,560
They have gone there.

146
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,680
Just follow the light

147
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,080
and they will be waiting for you

148
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,510
at the Palace of Flames.

149
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,000
Then

150
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,480
won’t you go with us?

151
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,480
Yin Zhuang,

152
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,080
wait!

153
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:00,790
Yin Zhuang.

154
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,270
Stop!

155
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,960
Don’t go there.

156
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,470
It is a trap.

157
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,510
Wu Yuan,

158
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,600
what’s up?

159
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,480
What are you talking about?

160
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,120
That person

161
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,080
isn’t Yin Zhuang.

162
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,750
Who is she if she isn’t Yin Zhuang?

163
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,910
Wu Yuan, no more kidding.

164
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,630
Let’s go. Hurry up.

165
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,310
Silly.

166
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,270
What a silly man you are!

167
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,550
Yin Xiao is right.

168
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,480
Wu Yuan.

169
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,440
I know you are wronged.

170
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,280
We will all say sorry to you

171
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,610
when we are back.

172
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,120
Linglong is still waiting for me now.

173
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,670
Let’s go.

174
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
Save yourself first,

175
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,440
Huotu Xin.

176
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,310
Nobody can be saved.

177
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,240
All people will die except Linglong.

178
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,070
What do you mean?

179
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,270
Die!

180
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,680
They will die, don’t you know it?

181
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,430
They will all die here.

182
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,360
What happened?

183
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
Who is threatening you?

184
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,200
Yin Zhuang is dead.

185
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,120
I killed her.

186
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,480
Then…

187
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,560
who was that person?

188
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,120
I don’t know.

189
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,080
But Weisheng Yan

190
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,320
must be the person behind all these.

191
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,360
Everything,

192
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,800
including taking you here,

193
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,510
was arranged by him.

194
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,480
Huotu Xin.

195
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,240
Huotu Xin, don’t go there.

196
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,320
You can’t defeat Weisheng Yan.

197
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,430
Weisheng Yan?

198
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,320
Yes,

199
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,320
I have been working for him.

200
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,510
Why?

201
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,590
Because only he can

202
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,960
control Linglong.

203
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,870
Only he can help me.

204
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,080
Will Linglong be in danger?

205
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,070
No.

206
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,440
He will allow Linglong to survive.

207
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,750
Is there a way to save Linglong

208
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,480
at the Palace of Flames?

209
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,510
I am afraid

210
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,870
only Weisheng Yan knows it.

211
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,510
Why do you tell me about it?

212
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,600
I know you won’t believe me.

213
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,350
But I don’t expect you

214
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,830
to die without knowing the truth.

215
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,870
Huotu Xin.

216
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,440
Do you remember it, Huotu Xin?

217
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,750
When I was at the Fire Tribe,

218
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,070
I told you not to go back.

219
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,720
I…

220
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,870
I believe you.

221
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,240
But I won’t give up on Linglong.

222
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,910
Never.

223
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,320
If we can meet again,

224
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,830
maybe you will see

225
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,030
a different me.

226
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,590
Yin Zhuang!

227
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,640
Huotu Xin!

228
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,480
Do you hear me?

229
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,030
Are you lost?

230
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,960
Yin Zhuang.

231
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,600
Follow the light.

232
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,590
No.

233
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,200
You are not Yin Zhuang.

234
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,840
Although

235
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,750
Yin Zhuang looks strange,

236
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,710
she has pointed out the right way.

237
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,790
But where is my father?

238
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,360
This is the palace

239
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,480
of the deceased king of Fire Tribe.

240
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,720
The palace of Fire Tribe

241
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,670
are comparable with those of Zhaodu.

242
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,910
Yes.

243
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,160
But they were all destroyed

244
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,160
by Huotu Ke for the ruling of the state.

245
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,750
As the legend goes,

246
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,880
in the reign of Huotu Ke,
his Jinshi City

247
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,110
claimed half the wealth of Suchuan,

248
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,720
and was almost as rich as

249
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,790
Zhaodu of Emperor Yuan Tu.

250
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,320
But

251
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,710
his yearning for the Spirit Stone

252
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
finally destroyed him.

253
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,600
Is the pursuit of unlimited power

254
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,600
his way of ruling?

255

256
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,910
Actually,

257
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,110
I wonder if I am the same as Huotu Ke.

258
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,680
Is my previous desire for God power

259
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,480
the source of all disasters?

260
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,880
Am I wrong

261
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
in my pursuit of the ruling way?

262
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,800
Yuan Yi,

263
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,830
don’t you believe me anymore?

264
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,590
No.

265
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,680
I had believed I must make a choice

266
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,240
between Suchuan and you

267
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,270
even until yesterday.

268
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,270
But now I realize

269
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,920
the God power

270
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,680
shouldn’t be the thing I am pursuing.

271
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,110
Why are you all

272
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,920
saying something

273
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,190
I don’t understand here?

274
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,240
Are you hiding something

275
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,350
from me?

276
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,480
I have considered it for long.

277
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,240
Today,

278
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,070
I will tell you all the truth.

279
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,000
After that,

280
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,030
I will make a choice with you.

281
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,360
Then,

282
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,390
I hope you won’t be the Goddess.

283
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,000
Instead,

284
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,390
you will be someone more important.

285
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,400
What a perfect couple!

286
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,960
Yin Zhuang.

287
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,280
Linglong!

288
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,270
Linglong!

289
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,640
Yin Zhuang!

290
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,960
Yin Zhuang!

291
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,950
Your words are really touching,

292
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,790
Your Majesty.

293
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,320
If Emperor Yuan Tu

294
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,310
had shared the same feeling then,

295
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,750
these disasters

296
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,030
wouldn’t have occurred.

297
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,070
Why do you keep talking about the past?

298
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,750
What did you find
at the Palace of Flames?

299
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,590
There are too many secrets

300
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,310
at the Palace of Flames and

301
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,960
they have been covered for too long.

302
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,560
So long

303
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,550
that I almost don’t believe

304
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,480
they will be uncovered

305
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,000
one day.

306
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,400
I wonder which one

307
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,670
Your Majesty wants to hear first.

308
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,750
Have you really discovered anything,

309
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,830
Yin Zhuang?

310
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,880
Do you know the secrets of Weisheng Yan?

311
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,000
Weisheng Yan?

312
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,830
Compared with the things here,

313
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,240
Weisheng Yan is nothing.

314
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,870
What is it then?

315
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,830
Don’t worry.

316
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,790
Wait until all people are here.

317
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,030
My father…

318
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,440
He will arrive soon.

319
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:30,960
Your Majesty,

320
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,800
please take your throne.

321
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,200
This is Huotu Ke’s throne.

322
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,280
Yes.

323
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,150
If you don’t see everything here

324
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,400
from the eye of Huotu Ke,

325
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,790
how can you really

326
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,160
feel what he felt?

327
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,430
Yuan Yi?

328
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,920
Yuan Yi.

329
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,320
Linglong, danger!

330
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,270
Don’t get close to Yin Zhuang!

331
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,720
Stand up!

332
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,360
Linglong.

333
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,510
Don’t go there, Linglong.

334
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,000
Don’t go up there.

335
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,590
What’s going on?

336
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,150
Yuan…

337
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,120
Your Majesty.

338
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,550
Do you feel the pain

339
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,200
of Huotu Ke?

340
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,720
I have done

341
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,000
what you asked me to do.

342
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,510
Well done!

343
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,510
You should give me

344
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,070
what you promised me.

345
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,510
Don’t worry.

346
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,310
Let me tell you a story first.

347
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,480
What is the most touching love

348
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,640
you have ever seen?

349
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,550
The one I have seen

350
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
happened right here.

351
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,240
It is a story about a boy of Huotu

352
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,160
and a girl of the Yin family.

353
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,560
Your flowers,

354
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,910
your grass,

355
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,000
your mountains,

356
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,150
your sky and clouds,

357
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,790
your smell,

358
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,480
your voice,

359
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,480
the air you breathe,

360
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,510
I will remember everything

361
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,270
about you.

362
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:14,830
Yuan Yi.

363
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,120
Don’t touch him.

364
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,510
His Majesty is still alive.

365
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,000
But if you touch him,

366
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,630
he will die.

367
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,040
You…

368
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,040
Linglong, don’t go there.

369
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,750
Linglong!

370
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,240
I will never

371
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,030
allow Yuan Yi to die.

372
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
Die?

373
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,960
He deserves much more than death.

374
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,720
I want him

375
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
to see the land

376
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,880
ridden with his sins to suffer

377
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,880
from the scorching of Earth Fire,

378
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,630
and slowly

379
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,310
wither here

380
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,470
a few hundred years later.

381
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,920
What are you talking about?

382
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,110
Yin Zhuang,

383
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,750
what’s wrong with you?

384
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,240
I am not Yin Zhuang.

385
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,670
But the bracelet you wear

386
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,400
won’t tell a lie.

387
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,720
It is not easy

388
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,880
to remove the bracelet.

389
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,270
Will the same tragedy

390
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,550
happen again?

391
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,750
She isn’t Yin Zhuang.

392
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:19,920
No,

393
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,320
I am not Yin Zhuang.

394
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,550
I am Yin Jia.

395
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,840
Yin Jia?

396
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,350
A girl of the Yin Family

397
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,550
who loved Huotu Ke so crazily.

398
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,550
Huotu Ke

399
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,790
was a figure five hundred years ago.

400
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,630
This story

401
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,030
must be older than the Earth Fire.

402
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,720
And they are the same violent.

403
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,240
It

404
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,830
can’t even be extinguished today.

405
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
Yin Jia

406
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,590
is a name

407
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,150
that the Yin family wishes

408
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,440
to eliminate from its history.

409
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,710
To the Yin family,

410
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
it is a name

411
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,720
full of sins,

412
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,310
humiliation,

413
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,830
and dirtiness.

414
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,680
But to the Huotu family,

415
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,000
she is the only

416
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,150
and the holiest

417
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,000
savior.

418
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,910
Blood.

419
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,240
Yin Jia.

420
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,630
Who is Yin Jia then?

421
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,510
She was the ancestor of the Yin Family.

422
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,390
Ancestor?

423
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,800
No.

424
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,910
The Yins doesn’t have such an ancestor.

425
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,640
A girl of the Yins

426
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,830
who became an enemy of the family,

427
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,550
abandoned her noble blood and reputation

428
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,960
and even killed her father

429
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,030
just to follow Huotu Ke.

430
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,960
Wasn’t Huotu Ke

431
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,310
the person who

432
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,310
ignited the Earth Fire?

433
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,550
If the whole world believes

434
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,310
your beloved

435
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,030
commits an unforgivable crime

436
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,440
and only you know he doesn’t,

437
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,520
what will you do then?

438
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,550
-Kill him.
-Kill him.

439
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,030
-Decapitate.
-Kill him.

440
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,240
-Kill him.
-Kill him right away.

441
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,030
-Kill him.
-Kill him.

442
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,550
-Kill him.
-Decapitate him right away.

443
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,150
Huotu Ke of the Fire Tribe

444
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,910
has ignited the Earth Fire,

445
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,270
harmed the living beings

446
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
and offended the God.

447
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
If all people

448
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
are murderers of your beloved,

449
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,200
what will you do then?

450
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,750
Huotu Ke of the Fire Tribe

451
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,430
has ignited the Earth Fire,

452
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,000
harmed the living beings

453
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,000
and offended the God.

454
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,640
Will you rival with the world

455
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,150
just for him?

456
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,750
Huotu Ke of the Fire Tribe

457
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,750
has ignited the Earth Fire,

458
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,390
harmed the living beings

459
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,390
and offended the God.

460
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,030
This little blood

461
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,120
isn’t enough.

462
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,480
It isn’t your blood,

463
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,960
nor your body.

464
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,030
Come out here.

465
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,120
Where is your power?

466
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Can’t you move?

467
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,350
You lost the power of your ancestor.

468
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,840
And have no reverence to your ancestor.

469
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,000
The Yins

470
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,920
is really a miserable

471
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,910
and absurd family.

472
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,160
If your beloved

473
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,670
becomes a scapegoat of history,

474
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,200
what will you do then?

475
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,670
Who on earth are you?

476
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,190
Why do you want to hurt Yuan Yi?

477
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,200
Yin Jia,

478
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,590
a sinful girl

479
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,920
driven out by the ancestor

480
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,440
of the Yins five hundred years ago.

481
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,070
Five hundred years ago?

482
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,680
Nonsense!

483
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,840
How can a person
be five hundred years old?

484
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,000
Live?

485
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,080
It can’t be called “live”.

486
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,440
She is a phantom

487
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,400
living in the shadow of history.

488
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,110
Sinful girl.

489
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,390
Sinful girl.

490
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,110
Sinful girl.

491
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,960
Exactly.

492
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,030
I am a sinful girl indeed.

493
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,880
I have become sinful

494
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,160
as I am a girl of the Yins.

495
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,910
Like Your Majesty,

496
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,070
we are all the offspring of sinners.

497
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,200
I will never allow you to harm Yuan Yi.

498
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,110
Linglong.

499
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,510
Goddess?

500
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,550
She is just a crazy dog

501
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,150
of the Yuan family.

502
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,070
Let go of her.

503
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,150
Don’t come here.

504
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,630
I… I am coming to save you.

505
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,400
Linglong.

506
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,920
Linglong.

507
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,440
Linglong!

508
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,510
Linglong.

509
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,920
Release His Majesty.

510
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,160
Do you really want to harm your sister?

511
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,480
Yin Zhuang!

512
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,110
Do you hear me, Yin Zhuang?

513
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,400
Yin Zhuang.

514
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,670
What a pitiful person.

515
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,360
Your Majesty.

516
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,190
Do they know the great sins

517
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,920
they are trying to guard?

518
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,440
Huotu Ke is wronged.

519
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,710
He

520
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,230
was just another wronged soul

521
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,670
in the history of the Yuans.

522
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,240
The real source of the Earth Fire

523
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,960
is Emperor Yuan Tu,

524
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,320
the ancestor of Yuan Yi

525
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,830
and the greatest emperor of Suchuan.

526
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,000
Huotu Ke,

527
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,710
I have avenged for you.

528
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,670
You have made a long-term plan

529
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,960
just to

530
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,510
attract His Majesty here

531
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,070
and avenge for Yin Jia.

532
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,670
Why did you do it?

533
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,630
If I say

534
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,070
I was moved

535
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,840
by Yin Jia’s love story.

536
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,550
Will you believe it?

537
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,870
Do you know love, too?

538
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,590
Do I know?

539
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,280
Yes, I know.

540
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
But I have never seen it.

541
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,280
Why did you do it

542
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,720
on earth then?

543
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,630
Why?

544
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,800
Of course for a transaction
with Yin Jia.

545
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,360
Then,

546
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,280
what about the others?

547
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,670
Will Yin Jia kill them too?

548
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,030
Or

549
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,630
will you kill them?

550
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,320
It depends on their choice.

551
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,630
Do you know why I cured

552
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,750
your grandfather’s disease?

553
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,150
Because

554
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,030
I want you to have a weakness

555
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,510
in the world.

556
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,120
If you wish to get out of my control,

557
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,880
you need to refrain yourself

558
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,590
and don’t leave any new weakness.

559
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,630
Wu Yuan,

560
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
to people like us,

561
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,070
love

562
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,800
is just useless.

563
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,710
Your Majesty.

564
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,000
Congratulations!

565
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,750
You have taken revenge.

566
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,280
Please

567
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,830
honor your promise.

568
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,400
Is this the Spirit Stone?

569
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,390
Exactly.

570
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,310
This is the Spirit Stone that

571
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,800
has the power to kill the God,

572
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
and Emperor Yuan Tu

573
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,360
has tried his best to obtain even

574
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,080
at the cost of igniting the Earth Fire.
