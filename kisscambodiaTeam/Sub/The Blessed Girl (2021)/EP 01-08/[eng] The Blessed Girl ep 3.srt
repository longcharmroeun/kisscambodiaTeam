<i>Episode 3</i>

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,590
So,

25
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,280
the light in the Palace of Flames

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,470
is because of me?

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,000
Only when the power of the Goddess
is felt,

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,560
the Pillar of Eternity

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,800
gives out light like that

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,520
to show the existence of the Goddess.

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,030
Sixteen years ago, when you were born,

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,680
it gave out light once.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,710
When you transformed,

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,630
it proved again that you’re the Goddess.

35
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,030
If you are really the king of Suchuan,

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,030
why did you conceal it?

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,430
Simply speaking,

38
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,630
the current situation
of Suchuan is complicated.

39
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,400
Many people want to replace me.

40
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,240
That’s why you need me.

41
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,280
But that’s not the only reason.

42
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,240
If you are the king,

43
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,150
where is your queen?

44
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,190
I don’t have one yet.

45
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,520
Not yet?

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,430
Besides,

47
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,590
did I look beautiful

48
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,840
when I transformed?

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,030
Yes.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,630
That’s the prettiest thing
I’ve ever seen.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,960
Thing?

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,560
No.

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,360
The prettiest person.

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,150
Well,

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,030
did I look better than

56
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,750
what I look like now?

57
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,960
What you look like now

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,710
is the most beautiful.

59
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,150
Stop!

60
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,040
What?

61
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,000
Don’t you want to find your daughter?

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,920
Who on earth are you?

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,360
What do you want?

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
To find your daughter.

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,270
She’s not here.

66
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,750
Yeah.

67
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,630
But so long as you’re my hostage,

68
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,510
she is sure to come here for you.

69
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,680
Linglong,

70
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,360
do you believe

71
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,120
all that I say?

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,630
Em.

73
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,600
That’s why I take you here.

74
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,870
To see the Glory Rock.

75
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,310
Only when standing here and
looking at it,

76
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,390
do I know if I’m really

77
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,270
willing to leave here.

78
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,390
Every time I stand here,

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,160
I can hear it whispering.

80
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,870
It’s the echo of the strikes that
Earth Fire did on it

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,720
in the past five hundred years.

82
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,600
It’s the memory that lights up

83
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,630
the life of people in Fire Tribe.

84
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,950
I only saw records

85
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,720
on the Flame Chilling Wall

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,240
in the old scrolls.

87
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,070
But the shock I feel when I see it

88
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,000
is more vivid than when I read

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,390
the words in the scrolls.

90
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,040
That’s not the real Flame Chilling Wall.

91
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,510
This is.

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
Every name on it

93
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,920
is a wall that prevents

94
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,070
the Earth Fire from going further.

95
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,600
Here is the real

96
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,680
Flame Chilling Wall of Fire Tribe.

97
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,630
Only warriors who have
fought with the Earth Fire

98
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,830
are qualified to engrave their names

99
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,830
on the Glory Rock.

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,070
But do you know?

101
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,750
On the rock,

102
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,390
there will no longer exist

103
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,480
my father’s name.

104
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,680
Maybe there won’t be mine.

105
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
If I’m really the Goddess,

106
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,480
then

107
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,480
can I put out the Earth Fire?

108
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,560
I don’t know.

109
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,510
But there must be a way.

110
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,000
All the time,

111
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,360
to find the Fire Demon,

112
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,600
put out Earth Fire,

113
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,600
and carve my name on Glory Rock

114
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,950
are the biggest wishes

115
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,830
of my life.

116
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,600
But I want to thank you.

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,920
If you hadn’t come here

118
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,600
and tell them I was the Goddess,

119
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,160
maybe I

120
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,950
would have been treated as

121
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
a monster like my mother,

122
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,870
or even

123
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,680
would have been killed.

124
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,270
No. You wouldn’t.

125
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,120
You are the Goddess

126
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,040
who will not be hurt by mortals.

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

128
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,950
My father

129
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,190
won’t let anyone hurt me.

130
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,120
In Zhaodu, your imperial city,

131
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,870
is there a Glory Rock, too?

132
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,480
If I’m really the Goddess

133
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,390
who can save Suchuan,

134
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,080
will my name

135
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,390
be engraved on it, too?

136
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,320
There isn’t a Glory Rock in Zhaodu.

137
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,510
But

138
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,390
I’ll build one for you.

139
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,150
I’ll build a Glory Rock

140
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,150
that only belongs to you.

141
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,150
I believe you.

142
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,240
I’ll let everyone know

143
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,030
I’m not a monster.

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,630
Next,

145
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,670
the most difficult thing is

146
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,790
to persuade my father.

147
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,270
Let’s go.

148
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,390
Linglong.

149
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,480
Tanmiao?

150
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,670
Are you here alone?

151
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,790
You got better?

152
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,750
Who is he?

153
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,630
He...

154
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,150
He is my savior.

155
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,790
Don’t tell anyone

156
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,550
that you saw us.

157
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,600
Remember?

158
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:23,910
Yes.

159
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:32,850
Hush.

160
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,510
Just stay here

161
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,360
and wait for my father...

162
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,790
Come in.

163
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,510
Come in.

164
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,080
When my father comes back,

165
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,000
I’ll explain to him.

166
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:53,910
Come.

167
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Sit down.

168
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,440
You must be hungry.

169
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,360
If your father doesn’t agree,

170
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,840
will you go with me?

171
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,480
He will agree.

172
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,670
There is no room for me here.

173
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,720
He won’t let me be wronged.

174
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,000
It’s because your people

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
don’t really know about you.

176
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,120
Soon

177
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,270
they will get to know you again.

178
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,360
I think so, too.

179
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,600
Why don’t you sit down?

180
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,750
You must be tired these days.

181
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,840
Would you like to...?

182
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,200
Who made my bed this messy?

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,630
I... I’m not like this usually.

184
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,960
It must be my father.

185
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,600
Hold on.

186
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,360
Wait a minute.

187
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,910
It’s done.

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,480
Don’t worry.

189
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,120
It is messy

190
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,200
but clean.

191
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,670
It’s fine.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,910
I had a good rest.

193
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,630
I’m not tired.

194
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,390
Well, it’s up to you.

195
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:50,870
Are...

196
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,120
Are you uncomfortable?

197
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,320
I.. I’m okay.

198
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,360
I just...

199
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,320
just...

200
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,840
It’s the first time...

201
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,960
the first time...

202
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,510
The first time what?

203
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,120
It’s the first time

204
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,870
I go into the Goddess’s room.

205
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,080
Yes.

206
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,910
I used to believe that

207
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,360
the Goddess should be worshipped

208
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,440
in Tianqi Temple.

209
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,840
Isn’t it surprising?

210
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,360
I used to believe that

211
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,910
the emperor should be worshipped
on the throne.

212
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,080
But I didn’t expect

213
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,550
to see an emperor

214
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,870
in a room of a country girl.

215
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,320
Yes.

216
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,480
Did you sleep well?

217
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,910
Are you okay?

218
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,480
What are you doing?

219
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,790
What are you afraid of?

220
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,270
I’m not a bad guy.

221
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,480
I won’t hurt you.

222
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,240
Don’t come over!

223
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,630
What if I must?

224
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
What do you want to do?

225
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,200
You can’t do it.

226
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,120
What do you want?

227
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,080
There must be a misunderstanding.

228
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,510
Well...

229
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,030
Who are you?

230
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
I’m here to help you

231
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,390
and your daughter.

232
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,030
I don’t believe you.

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,670
Don’t be a stingy man.

234
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,750
If I don’t coax you,

235
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
will you go with me?

236
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,960
Trust me.

237
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,320
Don’t go back to Fire Tribe.

238
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,240
It’s for your own good.

239
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,910
At present, Fire Tribe,

240
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,320
is the most dangerous place

241
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,550
for you and your daughter in Suchuan.

242
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,440
The Leader of your tribe believes

243
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,360
Linglong is a monster.

244
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,240
He won’t let you go.

245
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Maybe Linglong

246
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,550
has already been locked up.

247
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,510
No need to care about our tribe.

248
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,790
Fine.

249
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,510
Even if you’re not afraid of them,

250
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,030
I’m telling you

251
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,080
the men of Marquis Pingjiang
will be here soon.

252
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,910
What monkeys?

253
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,360
It’s a praise to you Fire Tribe members

254
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,630
to say you’re ignorant.

255
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,510
You only know Earth Fire.

256
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,240
Let’s just say

257
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,270
Zhu Xi, Marquis Pingjiang,

258
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,550
is the “Earth fire” of Suchuan.

259
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,840
Besides,

260
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,200
in this world,

261
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,270
there is no Flame Chilling Wall
to stop him.

262
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,150
What will he do?

263
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,080
Take your daughter away.

264
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,790
Why does he do this?

265
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,360
Why?

266
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,030
Don’t ask why.

267
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,870
Are you going to reason with him?

268
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,120
Tell me something useful,

269
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,080
such as the conversation
between only you two,

270
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,670
so Linglong can believe me.

271
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,150
I’ll bring her here for you.

272
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,960
I don’t buy your words.

273
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,600
Okay.

274
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,000
Then go and see yourself.

275
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,080
Why is there no food?

276
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,240

I’ll go for a look.

290
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,510
Go and search!

291
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,000
Leader?

292
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,070
Take Linglong away.

293
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,830
Leader, listen to me.

294
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,790
Take them away!

295
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,240
I...

296
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,270
Chi Fang.

297
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
Listen to me.

298
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,550
It’s not what you think.

299
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,920
Chi Fang.

300
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,310
Linglong.

301
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,830
It’s Leader’s order.

302
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:48,790
Well...

303
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,000
Close the gate.

304
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,550
Be at ease.

305
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,750
My father will find me

306
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,720
at the cost of ruining the tribe.

307
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,790
Uncle Xin!

308
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,640
Tanmiao.

309
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,310
Uncle Xin.

310
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:14,830
What happened?

311
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,400
Linglong...

312
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,480
Linglong was taken away by Leader.

313
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,160
Where are they taking her to?

314
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
I don’t know.

315
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,880
Leader and his men

316
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,310
were very fierce.

317
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,070
And,

318
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,200
there is also a man.

319
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,830
That bastard!

320
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,960
Who are they?

321
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,160
The men of Marquis Pingjiang
will be here soon.

322
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,750
Their purpose

323
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
is to take your daughter away.

324
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:44,790
Tanmiao,

325
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,270
go back and tell Leader that

326
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,110
strangers are coming
to take Linglong away.

327
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,550
Let him hide Linglong quickly.

328
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,200
Do you hear it?

329
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,480
Do you hear it?

330
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,350
Go now.

331
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,270
Okay.

332
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,440
It is the territory of Fire Tribe.

333
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,440
No matter who you are,

334
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,160
we don’t welcome strangers.

335
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,680
Are people of Fire Tribe

336
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,000
all rude to guests?

337
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,640
It’s really impolite

338
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,830
to come here rashly.

339
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,640
Okay.

340
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,030
I’ll give you

341
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,830
a gift.

342
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,590
I’ll repeat it.

343
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,240
Fire Tribe

344
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,480
doesn’t welcome any stranger.

345
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,920
Is it the Fire Spear?

346
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,830
I don’t seem

347
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,350
to know how to use it.

348
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,070
I still like to use

349
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,750
a knife.

350
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,590
You’ll be my gift of greeting.

351
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,920
Let’s go.

352
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,510
Take us to Fire Tribe.

353
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,720
Don’t leave anyone.

354
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,440
Women and children, go into the wall.

355
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,400
Bring enough food.

356
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,830
Don’t come out without my order.

357
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,200
Don’t be careless.

358
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,270
Leader.

359
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,030
Leader.

360
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,030
Is it all done?

361
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,830
Yes.

362
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,920
They are locked in a deserted mine
of the ancestors.

363
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,270
No one can find them.

364
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,680
There is enough food and water.

365
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,640
Don’t worry.

366
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,240
It’s just these few days.

367
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,200
They will be able to survive.

368
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,310
Leader.

369
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,030
You’re making a big deal out of it.

370
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,720
What are you afraid of?

371
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
I don’t know.

372
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,200
Maybe I worry too much.

373
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,640
Did you find Huotu Xin?

374
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,350
No.

375
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,550
Who are they? Why are they here?

376
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,720
Let go of me.

377
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,750
Let go of me.

378
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,510
Mother.

379
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,480
Mother!

380
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,640
Help me!

381
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,680
Tanmiao. Tanmiao.

382
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,110
-Madam. Don’t go. Don’t go.
-Mother!

383
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,790
-Stop her!
-Who are you?

384
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,750
What do you want?

385
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,750
Help me!

386
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,200
Mother!

387
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,480
Who are you?

388
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,240
Why do you hurt my people?

389
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,720
Are you the leader?

390
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,350
Yes.

391
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,400
I’m here for someone on behalf of
Zhu Xi, Marquis Pingjiang.

392
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,960
As long as you don’t seek troubles,

393
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,270
I’ll just take the person away.

394
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,830
I won’t cause you any trouble.

395
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,640
Otherwise...

396
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,640
Huotu Xin, what are you...?

397
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,070
I only want the person I want.

398
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,440
Take her to me,

399
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
and everyone will be fine.

400
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,400
Who do you want?

401
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,070
I don’t know.

402
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,160
If there is such a person,

403
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I’ll release her.

404
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,720
Okay.

405
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,350
Tell me.

406
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,440
Who lit up the Pillar of Eternity?

407
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,160
The Pillar of Eternity?

408
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,400
What’s that?

409
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,160
I don’t know.

410
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,590
Do you know what it is?

411
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,240
I don’t know. I don’t know.

412
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,680
Who made that light?

413
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,070
Or

414
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,640
among your people,

415
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,000
does someone feel

416
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,160
something wrong in his body recently?

417
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,550
Bring the person to me.

418
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,310
You see?

419
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,880
All our people are here.

420
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,160
Is there the one you are looking for?

421
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,590
They are looking for

422
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,310
a girl named Linglong.

423
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,720
Why are you so slow?

424
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,920
She must have gone.

425
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,550
I’m fast enough.

426
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,030
You didn’t watch her carefully.

427
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,750
Don’t blame me.

428
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,510
You are here to arrest someone.

429
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,440
If you don’t catch her,

430
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,110
go to explain to Marquis Pingjiang
yourself.

431
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,240
Did you hear that?

432
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,400
A girl named Linglong.

433
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,270
If you have any

434
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,110
news about her,

435
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,310
tell me.

436
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,640
Or you will

437
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,720
end up like him.

438
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,960
Be polite

439
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,550
to these people.

440
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,350
If it’s not them,

441
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,680
your grandparents would have been

442
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,110
burned to death by Earth Fire.

443
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,160
Are you okay?

444
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,680
Don’t be afraid.

445
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,720
You have me.

446
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,550
You won’t die.

447
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,000
Just look for the person you want.

448
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,200
Don’t cause troubles

449
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,750
and ruin the reputation of
Marquis Pingjiang.

450
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
The girl you are talking about

451
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,030
is also the one we are looking for.

452
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,550
We don’t know where she went.

453
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,510
I swear.

454
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,550
Okay.

455
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,110
I believe you.

456
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,160
Then I’ll wait here.

457
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
You’ll help me get her back.

458
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,070
Everyone.

459
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,590
Go get Linglong back.

460
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,830
Wait.

461
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,440
The men go to find Linglong while

462
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,680
women and children stay here.

463
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,510
Stay with me.

464
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,030
Are you okay?

465
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,440
How do you feel?

466
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,180
What happened?

467
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:36,960
Leader.

468
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,350
They can’t move.

469
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,200
Father.

470
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,720
Help me!

471
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,350
I can’t move.

472
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,200
Don’t hurt them.

473
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,110
I rushed here

474
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,310
and I’m already exhausted.

475
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,640
If I fall down,

476
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,400
I can’t protect them.

477
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,680
So,

478
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,000
you must

479
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,030
be quick.

480
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay.

481
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,440
Look for her!

482
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,790
Take Linglong back for me!

483
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,750
Don’t worry.

484
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,030
You lit up the Pillar of Eternity.

485
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,920
Zhaodu must have got the news.

486
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,880
The Chief Priest knows I’m here.

487
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
They will come soon to help us.

488
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,440
I’m not worried.

489
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,440
I am recalling.

490
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,400
Recalling what?

491
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,160
How did I become the Goddess?

492
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,920
Or

493
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,790
how do I use the power of the Goddess?

494
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,920
Do you know it?

495
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,400
In fact,

496
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,070
being chosen by Goddess
is only one condition.

497
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,160
To complete

498
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,960
the fusion with Goddess

499
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,480
is not easy.

500
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,510
Do you believe in Goddess?

501
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,590
I...

502
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,400
I even don’t know what Goddess is.

503
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,240
It’s okay.

504
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,350
When we go back to Zhaodu,

505
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,400
I’ll explain it to you.

506
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,790
But I can’t wait for that time.

507
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,880
My father hasn’t come to rescue me.

508
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,510
Something must have happened to him.

509
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,240
Do you know

510
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,880
why I transformed that night?

511
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,200
It may be because

512
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,440
you were burned by Earth Fire,

513
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,200
and you lost consciousness.

514
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,030
Then Goddess could temporarily

515
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,000
take over your body

516
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,200
and protect you.

517
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,240
I lost consciousness, and then

518
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,920
Goddess came to protect me.

519
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,720
Knock me out,

520
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,000
and the power of Goddess

521
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,720
can be activated.

522
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,750
Then we can go out.

523
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:04,640
No way.

524
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,110
I can’t do that.

525
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,310
Why?

526
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,680
You said that

527
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,750
your bloodline of the Yuan family

528
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,160
is linked to the mind of the Goddess.

529
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,030
You are the only one

530
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,030
who can communicate with Goddess.

531
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,680
Are you afraid that I’ll hurt you?

532
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,240
No.

533
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,240
I don’t.

534
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,640
I can’t do something

535
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,550
offensive to Goddess.

536
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,270
Absolutely not.

537
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,510
Fine.

538
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:26,920
You can’t.

539
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,200
Then I’ll knock myself out.

540
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,550
Linglong.

541
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,680
What are you doing?

542
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,000
Let go of me!

543
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:31,790
Let go.

544
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,790
Calm down.

545
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,480
Linglong.

546
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,110
Linglong.

547
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:37,920
Leader?

548
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,310
Don’t cry.

549
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,070
It’s fine. There, there.

550
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,640
Don’t cry.

551
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,240
Don’t cry.

552
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,070
Now you trust me?

553
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,350
Why didn’t you tell on me?

554
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,270
You still don’t believe me?

555
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,480
I went to your house
and got the clothes.

556
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,110
I like it.

557
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,070
Change it.

558
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,790
Look at the blood stains.

559
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,110
I care about you so much.

560
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,310
What are you doing?

561
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,880
When your daughter is here,

562
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,000
you won’t want her

563
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,070
to see you being like this.

564
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,750
Where is Linglong?

565
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,960
Where is she?

566
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:49,880
I don’t know.

567
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,270
But

568
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
as long as you are here,

569
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,200
she will definitely come.

570
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,750
Can your wound be cured

571
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,030
by your daughter?

572
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,160
She doesn’t know medicine.

573
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,030
How can she cure me?

574
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,840
What are you doing?

575
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,920
I have a crush on him.

576
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,230
Be nice to him.

577
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,670
Leader.

578
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,590
It isn’t the way back to the city.

579
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,070
Where are you taking us to?

580
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,360
We won’t go back.

581
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,760
And you can’t go back.

582
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,360
Tomorrow

583
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,630
there is a boat from Weisheng
in Pingting.

584
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,190
It’s right by White Forest Lake.

585
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,000
I did the Flammable Stone business

586
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,070
with them.

587
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,150
I intended to

588
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,880
ask your father to help me.

589
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,920
But it seems that he can’t.

590
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,230
I’ll try to get you on board.

591
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,840
Never come back.

592
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:06,960
Why?

593
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,400
Where’s my father?

594
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,480
What happened?

595
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
A group of terrible strangers came

596
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,190
and asked to take you away.

597
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
The women and children

598
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,630
in the tribe become hostages.

599
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,320
Your father

600
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,110
is also in their hands.

601
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,800
Linglong.

602
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,070
You know.

603
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,230
Your father never wants to
see you have any accident.

604
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,630
So,

605
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,960
you have to leave quickly.

606
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,630
Go as far as possible.

607
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,030
Who are those strangers?

608
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,800
It is said that they are

609
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,400
the men of Marquis Pingjiang.

610
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,760
Marquis Pingjiang, Zhu Xi?

611
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,150
Do you know him?

612
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,190
Will he obey your orders?

613
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,280
Who are you?

614
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,150
If it’s really Zhu Xi,

615
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,840
I’m afraid it won’t be easy

616
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,550
for you to escape.

617
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,630
No way.

618
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,710
I must go back to rescue my father.

619
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,760
Linglong.

620
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,030
Will you be of any help?

621
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,030
Leader.

622
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,480
You haven’t seen their means.

623
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,400
It’s not a game for kids.

624
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,360
Linglong.

625
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,480
You know your father’s temper.

626
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,670
If you don’t go,

627
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,360
when it’s late,

628
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,400
I can’t help you.

629
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,400
As for your father,

630
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,030
I will find another way to save him.

631
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,360
Listen to me.

632
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,710
Kid.

633
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,110
If you don’t say,

634
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,630
I won’t force you.

635
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,550
I treated you that way before

636
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,360
is because I had to protect
our people.

637
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,000
Please forgive me.

638
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,190
But from today,

639
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,280
please

640
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,280
protect Linglong well.

641
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,070
Can you promise me?

642
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,630
I respect Linglong’s wish.

643
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,670
I can’t go.

644
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,440
Linglong.

645
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,760
If you let me go first,

646
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,960
and then save my father,

647
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,550
even if you succeed,

648
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,230
our men are still here.

649
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,190
They will come back to revenge.

650
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,110
Linglong.

651
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:15,760
You...

652
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,440
Anyway, I’m half an outsider.

653
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,840
What I do

654
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,360
has nothing to do with Fire Tribe.

655
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,000
So,

656
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,320
my father

657
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,760
will be saved by myself.

658
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,110
From now on,

659
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,400
I’m no more a member of Fire Tribe.

660
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,760
No matter what you do,

661
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,280
I’ll support you.

662
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,400
Leader.

663
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,440
Tell me

664
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,710
what means they used.

665
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,320
It’s her.

666
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,800
Release them all.

667
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,590
Release them.

668
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,080
Great!

669
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,960
Go home with Mother.

670
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,670
Hurry up.

671
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,400
Are you okay? Go quickly.

672
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,070
Go home.

673
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,150
Go fast.

674
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,150
And him.

675
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,320
Him?

676
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,880
Someone of us has a crush on him.

677
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,400
So...

678
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,230
He can’t go.

679
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,110
Bring the girl here.

680
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,070
Okay.

681
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,550
Who are you?

682
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,710
Why were you looking for me?

683
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,190
Who dares to be rude to me?

684
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,030
Little girl.

685
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,480
Don’t be presumptuous in front of me.

686
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Since you came to me,

687
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,880
you should have known who I am.

688
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,550
If I’m not willing to come here,

689
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,230
can the people of Fire Tribe

690
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,280
catch me?

691
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,230
Your name.

692
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,800
Is that all?

693
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,400
That’s all.

694
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,480
Here is my silver bullet!

695
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,000
Linglong!

696
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:19,880
Linglong!

697
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:41,800
Linglong!

698
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,440
If I let him control me,

699
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,590
it means I’m unconscious.

700
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,670
If I’m in danger,

701
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,840
the power of the Goddess will
protect me.

702
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:06,840
Right?

703
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,000
Theoretically

704
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,480
it is.

705
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,400
Okay.
