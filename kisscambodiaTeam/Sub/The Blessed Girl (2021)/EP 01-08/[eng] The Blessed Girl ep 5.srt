24
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,710
You… You…

25
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,400
Listen to me.

26
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,240
I… I…

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,470
I’ve made a deal with your sister

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,750
that if I combed her hair,

29
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,470
she’d allow us to get on the ship.

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Just let my father go first.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,150
We mean you no harm.

32
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,030
Please listen to us.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:37,960
Xiao.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,840
What they said is true.

35
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,280
I had a deal with them.

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,840
Be careful not to hurt him.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,190
He has two kids here.

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes. Right.

39
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,470
How

40
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,430
would you guys

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,240
deal with stowaways?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,590
Throw them off the ship.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,680
You can’t drop us off.

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,430
Don’t drop us off.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,870
I’ve added fuses

46
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,910
in the Flammable Stone on the ship.

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,000
If you drop me off,

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,960
the entire ship will be burnt to ashes.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,150
I knew what you’re capable of.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,470
To protect ourselves,

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,190
I have to take such action.

52
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,400
I’m going to throw

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,360
the cargo from Fire Tribe

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,190
off the ship.

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Wait. Wait!

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,520
I was lying!

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,190
That’s not true!

58
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,030
There’s no fuse.

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,960
I… I…

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,910
I have other reasons.

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,120
I… I have no way to go.

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,030
As you see,

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,870
those violent and wicked people

64
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,120
are chasing us.

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,360
Why?

66
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,680
Because…

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,030
Because…

68
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,280
Because they want to catch my daughter.

69
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,120
Why?

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,150
If your daughter did something wrong,

71
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,590
they have a right to take her.

72
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,000
Of course not!

73
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,470
You are from Fire Tribe, right?

74
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,960
How would you mess up
with Marquis Pingjiang?

75
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,150
Because

76
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,430
Marquis Pingjiang

77
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,870
has taken a fancy

78
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,870
to my daughter Linglong.

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,830
Marquis Pingjiang

80
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,120
wanted to take her back
as his concubine.

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,390
That’s too much!

82
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,120
Linglong is just a kid.

83
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,560
That’s right.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,830
She is just a little girl.

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,270
So you should know

86
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,800
that we have no way to go.

87
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,390
You believe him?

88
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,480
You cajole Yin Zhuang to lie with you.

89
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,240
It’s unforgivable.

90
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,950
Father.

91
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,870
How can you still not tell the truth?

92
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
I’ve told you.

93
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,000
No one can lie

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,920
before the Yin family’s judgment.

95
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,950
I was telling the truth!

96
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,950
I was not lying!

97
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
It’s because I lighted
the Pillar of Eternity.

98
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,800
Linglong.

99
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:00,920
Go on.

100
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,190
A few days ago,

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,830
we still lived a common life
in Fire Tribe.

102
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,390
Later on,

103
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,720
when I went to Earth Fire,

104
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,870
I lighted the Pillar of Eternity
somehow.

105
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,310
And then they came to Fire Tribe.

106
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,950
They used women and children

107
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,120
to threaten my tribe members
for taking me,

108
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,160
and almost killed my father.

109
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,040
I don’t know

110
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,000
why they did that.

111
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
But if I didn’t go,

112
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,310
my tribe would be in danger.

113
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,160
So I sneaked into your ship.

114
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,630
It’s said that the Yins are good at
distinguishing the good from the bad.

115
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,430
Then show me

116
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,310
what you can do.

117
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,430
The Pillar of Eternity will

118
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
only be lightened for the Goddess.

119
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
I hope it’s true.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,430
Though what she said is weirder
than that of her father,

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
I believe she’s telling the truth.

122
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,310
Yin Zhuang believes you.

123
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
It means that you’re not lying.

124
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:18,800
Father.

125
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,720
They are strange.

126
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,070
Step away from them.

127
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,190
Go.

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,720
Father.

129
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,750
Are you okay?

130
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,830
How can you tell him that?

131
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
My intuition.

132
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,630
It’s better than your story anyway.

133
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,950
Now that the Yins believe you,

134
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,190
I have no reason to doubt you then.

135
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,070
Thank…

136
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,000
-Huotu Xin!
-Father!

137
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,630
Linglong!

138
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,720
Linglong!

139
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,240
Father!

140
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,680
Linglong!

141
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,360
Father!

142
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,560
Father!

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,630
What did you do?

144
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,310
Father!

145
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,800
Father!

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,720
No matter what reasons they said,

147
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,480
they are stowaways.

148
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,680
Moreover,

149
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,310
they’ve messed up
with Marquis Pingjiang.

150
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,120
Bringing them will only get

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,270
our business in Pingting involved,

152
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,040
or worse, get Master involved.

153
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,680
But how can you do that?

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
It’s so brutal.

155
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,310
You can bring them.

156
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,070
Anyway, when we arrive Pingting,

157
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,600
we’ll take them to Marquis Pingjiang.

158
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,390
Land right now.

159
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,630
Save my father!

160
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,240
Even if you can find him,

161
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
he may have been broken.

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,310
Land.

163
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,920
It’s an order.

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
You’re the offspring of the Yins.

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,870
You must recognize it.

166
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,480
Your Majesty.

167
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,360
Fine.

168
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,160
Land.

169
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Find Huotu Xin.

170
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:06,720
Father.

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,430
We still have hope.

172
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,630
You once saved your father.

173
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,920
You can do it.

174
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,030
Xiao.

175
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,360
Be careful.

176
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,600
Control it.

177
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,120
Steer well.

178
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,030
Land.

179
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,200
No way.

180
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,240
It has lost control.

181
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,510
What happened?

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,360
I don’t know.

183
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,510
The thunderstorm is so heavy

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,870
that Goldfish stopped working.

185
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,120
Move.

186
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,120
Quick.

187
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,960
Open all side sails.

188
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,670
Yes!

189
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,870
Open all side sails!

190
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,030
Open all side sails!

191
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,960
Don’t panic.

192
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,720
It’ll be okay after the thunderstorm.

193
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,550
Hold me tightly.

194
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,550
Juan.

195
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,840
Juan is still in the room.

196
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,080
Don’t worry.

197
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,720
I’ll protect you.

198
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
If I’m hurt,

199
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,510
you must save me.

200
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:14,960
Yin Zhuang.

201
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,670
Juan.

202
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,390
Don’t get close to the edge
of the Abyss.

203
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,670
Juan…

204
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,200
She…

205
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,720
I saw Juan

206
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,790
falling down to the Abyss.

207
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,480
Xiao.

208
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,440
How would it happen?

209
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,360
Everything was fine.

210
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,120
Juan… She…

211
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,080
Sorry.

212
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,270
I didn’t manage to save Juan.

213
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,600
It’s lucky that

214
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,270
you’re alive.

215
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,600
What I mean is…

216
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,630
Sorry for your loss.

217
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,440
You are alive.

218
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,150
Yes.

219
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,150
I was born to be lowly.

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,870
I have to learn how to survive.

221
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,480
As the ship owner,

222
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,000
at the most dangerous moment,

223
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,200
you left your crew and guests behind

224
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,480
and sought for your own living.

225
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,320
I need to take you two to Pingting

226
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,600
to finish the wedding
of your sister and my master.

227
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,870
As a servant,

228
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,630
you risked your masters’ life

229
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,480
at danger.

230
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,870
Seems that you didn’t take good care

231
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,840
of your own master, either.

232
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,360
The top priority now

233
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,000
is His Majesty’s life.

234
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,510
What’s that?

235
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,240
Trackers.

236
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,270
Seems that

237
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,120
what we met

238
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,720
is not a normal thunderstorm.

239
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,150
When we arrive Pingting,

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,080
you should

241
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,600
apologize to Marquis Pingjiang.

242
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,870
Yuan Yi.

243
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,000
Yuan Yi.

244
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,390
Yuan Yi.

245
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:37,910
Yuan Yi.

246
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,390
Are you okay?

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,630
What about you?

248
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,630
You saved me again.

249
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,270
It seems that

250
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,840
you saved me this time.

251
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,200
What’s this?

252
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,360
Trackers.

253
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:07,960
Your Majesty.

254
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,360
You are all alive.

255
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,790
What a good luck.

256
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
I failed to protect Your Majesty.

257
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,390
I’m culpable.

258
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,440
Never mind.

259
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,000
It’s good that you all are okay.

260
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,670
We are in a more urgent situation now.

261
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,790
Our location has been exposed.

262
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,270
We must withdraw immediately.

263
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,150
No.

264
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,750
I have to find my father first.

265
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You’re so lucky

266
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,390
to survive.

267
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,600
You did something

268
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,550
to the ship, didn’t you?

269
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,640
Where are the two kids?

270
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,880
I see no kids.

271
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,440
Only we three here.

272
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,640
You two keep looking.

273
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,200
Xiao.

274
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,000
No need to show mercy this time.

275
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,070
Father!

276
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,350
Father!

277
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,200
Yin Xiao is capable.

278
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,960
Don’t worry.

279
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,640
Let’s find your father first.

280
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,110
What’s the sound?

281
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,070
It may be

282
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,680
the Evil Soul.

283
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,000
Evil Soul?

284
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,200
Evil Souls are real?

285
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,240
You know Evil Souls?

286
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,960
The seniors in my tribe said

287
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,440
Evil Souls are the most horrible

288
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,310
monsters in Suchuan.

289
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,240
But no one has ever seen them.

290
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,720
We are in Scale Valley.

291
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,880
It’s close to the edge of the Abyss.

292
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,240
Caravans often

293
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,790
disappear here out of the void.

294
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,640
It’s said that

295
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,110
they met Evil Souls.

296
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,440
The ship crashed here.

297
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,640
They must have planned it early.

298
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,350
Zhu Xi.

299
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,750
It’s daytime now.

300
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,920
Evil Souls will not show up.

301
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,590
Only if we step away from the Abyss,

302
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,550
can we stay safe.

303
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,200
What if my father is in there?

304
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,240
I need to find him quickly

305
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,640
in case he meets Evil Souls.

306
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,350
Crap.

307
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,240
Run.

308
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,350
Found them.

309
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,240
Catch them up.

310
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,000
Xiao.

311
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,550
Take Yin Zhuang away.

312
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,350
Xiao.

313
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:16,920
Don’t worry.

314
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,640
I will take her

315
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,270
to Pingting safely.

316
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,030
-Go.
-Xiao.

317
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:22,720
Go.

318
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,510
You go first,

319
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,200
or I’ll be distracted.

320
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,880
Go.

321
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,030
No.

322
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,880
You surely are worthy of being a Yin.

323
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,720
I can’t control you wholly.

324
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,200
You know how to control minds.

325
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,960
Are you familiar with it?

326
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,880
How dare you copy

327
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,240
the Yin family’s power.

328
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,960
Now let me show your power

329
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,880
in front of you.

330
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,070
Xiao!

331
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,310
What the heck?

332
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,830
<i>Last night</i>

333
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,720
Father!

334
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,880
You have wings?

335
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,160
You…

336
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,310
Do you belong to
the legendary Moon Tribe?

337
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,270
Did you save me just now?

338
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,440
Thank you. Thanks so much.

339
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,160
No need to thank me.

340
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,200
They want you to be alive.

341
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,830
They?

342
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,590
Who’s them?

343
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,590
When you’re
in Marquis Pingjiang’s death row,

344
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,030
you’d rather fall to your death here.

345
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,550
Big wings.

346
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,830
Do you

347
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,070
hatch them out?

348
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,880
Or what?

349
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,110
Are you born to know how to fly?

350
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,830
Linglong!

351
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,880
Let me go!

352
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,720
My daughter is on the above.

353
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,000
I know.

354
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,400
Didn’t you say you want us to be alive?

355
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,680
Go to save her then.

356
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,790
Or she’ll fall down.

357
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,070
What’s the use of catching me?

358
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,920
Go to save her.

359
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,920
Linglong!

360
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,110
Linglong!

361
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,830
Take Yin Zhuang and go.

362
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,510
Xiao.

363
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,070
Don’t worry.

364
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,480
I will take her to Pingting safely.

365
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,200
-Go.
-Xiao.

366
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,240
Go.

367
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,720
You go first,

368
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,400
or I’ll be distracted.

369
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,200
Go.

370
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,550
No.

371
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,880
You surely are worthy of being a Yin.

372
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,000
Where’s Linglong?

373
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,440
I can’t control you wholly.

374
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,830
Now let me show your power

375
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,920
in front of you.

376
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
The bastard.

377
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,510
Xiao!

378
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,110
What the heck?

379
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,200
Where’s Linglong?

380
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,440
Linglong.

381
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,830
Are you okay?

382
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,440
I’m fine.

383
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,440
Who’s there?

384
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,590
Who are you?

385
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,680
What are you doing?

386
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,830
Someone’s killing us.

387
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,590
Who?

388
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,030
Who’s killing you?

389
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,240
What’s the matter, sirs?

390
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,270
Have you seen two kids?

391
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,110
A boy and a girl.

392
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,960
Ye… Yes.

393
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,550
They’re

394
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:43,960
over there.

395
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,640
They ran towards that direction.

396
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,590
Yes. It’s there.

397
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,830
I think

398
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,350
they are on your carriage.

399
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,790
No, no, no. I dare not.

400
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
No. They are not there.

401
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,160
I…

402
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,270
My carriage is empty.

403
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:54,880
I’m the only one here.

404
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,440
You dare lie to us.

405
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,960
It’s a waste of time.

406
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,640
Exactly.

407
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
I told you that the carriage is empty.

408
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
You didn’t trust me.

409
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
Nowadays,

410
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,720
you don’t even have

411
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,680
the least of reverence

412
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,550
for the God.

413
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,070
Don’t try to frighten us.

414
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,310
Now that you can’t hear

415
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,310
a plaintive cry from human,

416
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,720
I will show you

417
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,550
the fury of God.

418
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,440
Who are you?

419
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:21,920
You.

420
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,750
Do you have reverence for God?

421
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,720
Yes.

422
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,200
Yes, I do.

423
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,440
Then ran away now.

424
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,270
May God bless you.

425
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,200
Hope you can still live to tomorrow.

426
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,640
It’s okay!

427
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,240
Thank you.

428
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,750
Greetings to Your Majesty.

429
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,000
Who are you?

430
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,350
I am Fozhuan.

431
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,350
Fozhuan?

432
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,480
Master.

433
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,750
You must save my father.

434
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,750
You’re such a great master.

435
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,110
You can surely save my father.

436
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,200
Please.

437
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,480
Wait a minute.

438
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,160
Wait a minute.

439
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,000
Your Majesty.

440
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,160
Do you remember me?

441
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,960
It doesn’t matter.

442
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,680
Your Majesty,

443
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,030
why are you here?

444
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,720
You’re mistaken.

445
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,510
If you say so.

446
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,590
Master.

447
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,000
What did you say?

448
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,640
My father was pushed down

449
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,920
from the ship.

450
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,310
We must find him.

451
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,030
You can save him, can’t you?

452
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,880
The ship?

453
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,830
Linglong!

454
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,200
Linglong!

455
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,750
Linglong!

456
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,200
Linglong!

457
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,160
Linglong!

458
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,880
Linglong!

459
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,590
Linglong!

460
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,350
Here!

461
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,510
I found her.

462
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,270
Over there.

463
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,310
Where?

464
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:11,920
That’s great.

465
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,750
That’s great.

466
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,160
Where?

467
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,270
Over there.

468
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,200
Linglong.

469
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,270
Linglong.

470
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,400
Wait.

471
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,000
How about doing me a favor?

472
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,400
Yin Zhuang.

473
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,550
Are you okay?

474
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,720
I’m good.

475
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,510
We found your father.

476
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,680
You found him?

477
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,070
Where is him?

478
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,240
What’s wrong with my father?

479
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,830
What’s wrong with my father?

480
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,160
Father.

481
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,480
Are you alright?

482
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,590
Father.

483
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Wake up.

484
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,240
Father.

485
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,070
Yuan Yi.

486
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,440
Yuan Yi, help me.

487
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,960
Help me summon the Goddess out.

488
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,920
I want to save my father.

489
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:08,830
Father.

490
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,920
Father.

491
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,640
Master.

492
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Please help me save my father.

493
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,110
You can surely save him.

494
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,240
Bring his life back.

495
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:19,920
Father.

496
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,920
This man

497
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
fell from the sky?

498
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,160
He has a complete body.

499
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,830
No blood here.

500
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,310
You find it interesting

501
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,960
to lie to your daughter?

502
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,960
You… You…

503
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,640
You know nothing.

504
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,680
Linglong.

505
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,960
Look, I’m fine.

506
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,200
You tricked me, Huotu Xin!

507
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,030
Linglong.

508
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,640
Don’t be angry.

509
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,880
How did you feel?

510
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,550
Did you think I’m the most important

511
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,750
and the others can be left behind?

512
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,510
At that moment,

513
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,510
you can’t trick yourself.

514
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,070
Save it.

515
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,350
There.

516
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
There.

517
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,160
Don’t you feel happy

518
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,480
when knowing I’m okay?

519
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,750
Don’t fake it.

520
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,960
Here. Give me a hug.

521
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,440
I…

522
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,550
I thought…

523
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,070
There. There.

524
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,400
Good girl.

525
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,640
There. There.

526
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,240
Everything’s fine.

527
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,110
They’re so close.

528
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,480
There. There.

529
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,160
Look. I’m fine.

530
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,720
I am a lucky man.

531
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,830
Just now I also helped

532
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,350
the brother in poker face.

533
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,440
You’re smiling, aren’t you?

534
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,720
Linglong.

535
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,160
Who’s he?

536
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,440
Yeah.

537
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,510
Should I introduce myself first?

538
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,000
Father.

539
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,720
Drink it.

540
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,070
What’re you doing? Hurry up.

541
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,240
They will catch us up soon.

542
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,720
No hurry.

543
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,000
Just a moment.

544
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:16,480
Your Majesty.

545
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,510
If what he said is true,

546
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,830
Moon Tribe

547
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,920
can’t be trusted.

548
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,960
Why would I lie to you?

549
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,000
Or why

550
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,400
didn’t I die

551
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,550
when falling from such a high place?

552
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,790
It’s true.

553
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:32,830
Report.

554
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,110
Minister Fei,

555
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,160
no word is heard from His Majesty.

556
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,030
Hope that no word

557
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,310
is the best news.

558
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,070
Add more force

559
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,000
to find His Majesty quickly.

560
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,550
Yes.

561
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,200
Your Majesty.

562
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,640
Where are you?

563
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,310
Your Majesty,

564
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,070
do you recognize it?

565
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,550
This is

566
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,110
a feather from Fei Tian?

567
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,510
Yes.

568
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,750
Fozhuan.

569
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,480
Oh, I remember it.

570
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,070
Are you the disciple
who was dispelled from Tianqi

571
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,590
because you had a secret crush
on Fei Tian?

572
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,720
Why do you have Fei Tian’s feather?

573
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,350
You stole it?

574
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,270
It…

575
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,480
How can it be that I stole it?

576
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,680
Well.

577
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,880
The bastards in Zhaodu

578
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,830
must be jealous of me.

579
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,000
So they slandered me.

580
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,070
How dare they.

581
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,750
I’ve heard a lot about you.

582
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,920
I didn’t expect that

583
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,400
I can see you in person.

584
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Your Majesty.

585
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,790
Don’t believe

586
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,640
the rumors.

587
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,550
I am extremely serious

588
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,550
towards Fei Tian.

589
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,070
Who is Fei Tian?

590
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,640
The leader of Moon Tribe.

591
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:13,830
My minister.

592
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,590
She’s a woman?

593
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:17,880
Yes.

594
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,480
Right.

595
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,920
She has been long believing that

596
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,160
she can be the most important person

597
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,640
by His Majesty’s side.

598
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,030
I also trusted that

599
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,960
she can do that.

600
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,510
What’s this?

601
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,510
Guiding Stone.

602
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,200
Split a complete Guiding Stone

603
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,920
into two pieces.

604
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,200
They will

605
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,590
guide the one

606
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,350
to find the other.

607
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,440
With it,

608
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,920
the travelers afar

609
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,480
can always find their home.

610
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,590
Before,

611
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,400
in Jinshi City,
where our ancestor was living,

612
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,030
there’s a variety of

613
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,830
interesting stones.

614
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,790
This

615
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,590
may be

616
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,720
brought out at that time.

617
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,750
That’s where Zhaodu is located.

618
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,550
Yes.

619
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,960
Will Fei Tian

620
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,070
receive your signal?

621
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,880
Yes.

622
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,280
Fei Tian sent me the feather as a gift.

623
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,070
She told me

624
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
no matter when

625
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,800
and no matter where,

626
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,320
as long as I need her,

627
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,030
she will show up by my side.

628
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,320
Over a decade has gone by.

629
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,280
I never imagine that

630
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,280
I can see you again.

631
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,710
Fozhuan.

632
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,760
Everyone is fine?

633
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,070
We should drink some wine together.

634
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,440
Where are Zhu Xi’s men?

635
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,320
You beat them away, didn’t you?

636
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,360
You bastard.

637
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,110
Bastard.

638
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,280
You should remember.

639
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,360
Human’s life is never inferior.

640
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,110
I was doing my duty.

641
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,230
I had no intention of killing.

642
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,190
Now you’re doing good,

643
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,320
and I’ve done my job well.

644
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,550
Isn’t it a win-win result?

645
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,190
You…!

646
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,360
Don’t be angry with him.

647
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:17,880
Xiao.

648
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
I remember Father told us that

649
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,960
the one who can light up
the Pillar of Eternity is the Goddess.

650
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,550
Is Linglong the Goddess?

651
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,030
Whether she is the Goddess,

652
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,710
it depends on if Zhaodu accepts her.

653
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,070
Let’s stop guessing that.

654
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,110
But

655
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,590
it’s His Majesty who found her.

656
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,840
Actually, His Majesty can’t decide it.

657
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,920
Wow.

658
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,440
Master has so much stuff.

659
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,550
They are so lovely.

660
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,670
I hope they can always be fine.

661
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,550
What’s the matter?

662
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,670
Is it okay?

663
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,550
What are you doing?

664
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,960
Cooking.

665
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,920
Do you know fire will

666
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,760
attract our enemies’ attention?

667
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
I need to cook something nice
for Linglong.

668
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,920
She’s growing up.

669
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,070
She didn’t have something nice to eat

670
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,320
and she was frightened.

671
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,510
I must cook for her

672
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,150
to replenish the nutrition she needs.

673
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,110
What’s more important now?

674
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,360
Just a moment.

675
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,920
Please keep an eye on the enemies.

676
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,550
What do you want to cook?

677
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,960
Can we have it?

678
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,670
Yes.

679
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,630
It’s for us all.

680
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,760
I heard from Linglong that

681
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,030
you can make nice fish soup.

682
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,550
Can I taste it?

683
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,110
You…

684
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,880
Are you good at swordsmanship?

685
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,320
Would you help me catch two fishes?

686
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
I can make it with fishes.

687
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,590
Xiao.

688
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,000
I’ll help him.

689
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,280
It can be finished before it’s dark.

691
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,110
Has Your Majesty thought about

692
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,070
what

693
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,320
Zhaodu means

694
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,110
to her?

695
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,280
As long as I can find her,

696
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,360
I will confront everything

697
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,440
with her.

698
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,230
But does she know?

699
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,110
I will find a chance

700
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,440
to tell her.

701
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,630
Maybe it’s too long.

702
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,110
The Goddess has been a legend.

703
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,510
I can’t even

704
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,110
believe that

705
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,480
the Goddess will get out from the void

706
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,510
into the human world.

707
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,710
Maybe the people in the world

708
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,760
haven’t been well-prepared.

709
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,320
Maybe even the Goddess herself

710
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,360
has not been well-prepared yet.

711
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,590
Being the Goddess

712
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,800
is never an option.

713
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,400
Just like I am the king.

714
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,000
Well.

715
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,840
I, Fozhuan,

716
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,360
would escort the Goddess

717
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,440
to Zhaodu

718
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,510
even I have to risk my like.

719
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,630
Linglong.

720
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,550
Tell me.

721
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,400
When can I

722
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,840
have the power of a Goddess?

723
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,880
No hurry.

724
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,110
When we arrive in Zhaodu…

725
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,920
I can’t wait any more.

726
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,400
When I thought my father

727
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,320
was dead,

728
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,880
why can’t I do anything?

729
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,760
Do I

730
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,110
really have the power you said?

731
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,030
Am I really the Goddess?

732
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,280
You surely are.

733
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,230
We’ve seen it.

734
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,960
Do you forget that?

735
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,710
What happened today

736
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,400
will happen a lot more, right?

737
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,440
I want to go with you

738
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,590
to Zhaodu so much.

739
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,440
I also expect

740
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,230
what will happen next

741
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,110
and whom we will meet.

742
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,110
But

743
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,230
if the cost

744
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,030
is my father,

745
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,280
I’d rather go nowhere

746
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,880
and stay in my tribe forever.

747
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,670
I understand.

748
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,800
You can’t understand.

749
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,760
You’re born to be king.

750
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,840
You have had so many things
since you were born.

751
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,000
To be a king,

752
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,840
His Majesty has also lost a lot.

753
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,400
Fozhuan!

754
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,840
Your Majesty,

755
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,960
just now you said

756
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,840
you will confront everything

757
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,110
with the Goddess.

758
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,230
It’s true that

759
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,550
from ancient times,

760
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,320
the Yuan family has been chosen

761
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,590
to be the only king in Suchuan.

762
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,510
But after the Goddess descended,

763
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,710
Suchuan has been disintegrating

764
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,710
and vassal states have been rising.

765
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,000
Though Zhaodu

766
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,960
is the capital of Suchuan,

767
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,920
and I am

768
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,480
the king of Suchuan,

769
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,920
actually…

770
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,280
So

771
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,590
last time

772
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,510
you said your parents…

773
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,280
I wasn’t born in Zhaodu.

774
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,280
My father

775
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,440
is the lord of a fief

776
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,630
in northern Suchuan.

777
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,000
The king at that time

778
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,440
was my uncle.

779
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,360
Soon after I was born,

780
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,880
my uncle died of illness.

781
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,030
As his only successor,

782
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,230
I was sent to Zhaodu.

783
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:07,920
Back then, Fei Tian

784
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,960
was my father’s retainer.

785
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,070
To protect me,

786
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,000
my father ordered her

787
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,230
to accompany me to Zhaodu.

788
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,400
But after that,

789
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,550
the news came that

790
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,800
Ransu people in the north invaded,

791
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,070
my father died in the battles,

792
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,320
and no one in the family survived.

793
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,510
I was young.

794
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,880
I can only remember Fei Tian

795
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,030
kept telling me that,

796
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,280
Your Majesty,

797
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,070
remember,

798
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,920
you are the last decedent
of the Yuan family.

799
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,920
Sorry.

800
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,150
I shouldn’t

801
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,880
have said that.

802
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:58,920
Now the world is disintegrating.

803
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,550
People are suffering.

804
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,710
My experience is nothing.

805
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,110
But I hope

806
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,400
all these

807
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,190
can come to an end in my hands.

808
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,280
Have you

809
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,230
come back

810
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,440
to your hometown in the north?

811
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,800
Ever since I can remember,

812
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,510
I have been in Zhaodu.

813
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,440
Zhaodu is good.

814
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:28,800
You will like it.

815
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,510
I heard from Fei Tian that

816
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,000
when His Majesty came to Zhaodu,

817
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,840
he felt depressed all the time

818
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,150
and cared no state affairs.

819
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,440
But when His Majesty

820
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,030
stood on the Calculator

821
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,320
and the Star Map shone for him,

822
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,670
His Majesty

823
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,480
stopped being depressed.

824
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,920
In his three-year ruling,

825
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,190
he promoted Moon Tribe,

826
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,480
cleared old parties,

827
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,230
