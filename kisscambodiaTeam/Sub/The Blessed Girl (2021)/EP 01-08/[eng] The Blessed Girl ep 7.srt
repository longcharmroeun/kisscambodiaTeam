<i>Episode 7</i>

24
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,430
Put them down.

25
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,280
My name is Huotu

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,030
Linglong.

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,310
What’s your name?

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,590
My name is Ziyuan.

29
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,080
Are they

30
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,870
your friends?

31
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,430
They are…

32
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,400
Yes,

33
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,430
we are all servant girls

34
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,800
dispatched to your palace.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
Why did they leave then?

36
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,080
There are so many dishes here.

37
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,470
Let’s eat together.

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,910
Miss.

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,470
As servants, we eat in the wing room.

40
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,400
Wing room?

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
I think we are of a similar age.

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
I hope to eat with you

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,190
in the wing room later.

44
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,360
Take these with you.

45
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,120
Miss,

46
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,400
never do that.

47
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,310
Okay.

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Why the people in Zhaodu also avoid me?

49
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,510
How can I finish

50
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,720
a full table of dishes?

51
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,430
His Majesty is coming!

52
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,560
Yuan Yi,

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,310
you are finally here.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,190
I have figured out an idea for you.

55
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,430
What idea do you have for me?

56
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,720
You have fled for me.

57
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,270
Fei Tian was angry with you

58
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,040
all the way along for it.

59
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,430
She will surely blame you after return.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,310
I have an idea for you

61
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,070
so that Fei Tian won’t blame you.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,830
What are you drawing?

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,480
Look,

64
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,830
you may

65
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
pretend

66
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,270
to have been hurt for me.

67
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,190
First,

68
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,480
she must feel sad for your injury.

69
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,360
Second,

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,240
she will carry

71
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,310
out her anger on me.

72
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,830
You won’t be blamed in that case.

73
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,310
Playing sick is a trick

74
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,000
that has never failed on my father.

75
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,390
Fei Tian

76
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,270
looks even harsher than my father.

77
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,560
But all parents

78
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,720
love and care for their kids.

79
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,920
They are generally the same.

80
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,510
Linglong,

81
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,000
you don’t have to do that.

82
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,000
It doesn’t matter.

83
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,270
I am a guest anyway.

84
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,510
She can do nothing about me.

85
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,240
Maybe

86
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,870
I am Goddess.

87
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Just take it easy.

88
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,920
I am more experienced than you

89
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,920
in dealing with parents.

90
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,680
Look.

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,870
Linglong,

92
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,950
I am the emperor.

93
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,750
Even if I make any mistakes,

94
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,560
nobody dares to blame me.

95
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,190
Not even

96
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,390
Fei Tian?

97
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,680
She won’t blame me.

98
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,720
But she has even more horrible ways.

99
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,750
You don’t know Fei Tian much.

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
Your plans won’t work on her.

101
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,390
You will know it later.

102
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,600
You have written down all the plans

103
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,750
to gloss it over with Fei Tian?

104
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,190
No.

105
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,190
These are all my plans

106
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,950
to become Goddess the soonest

107
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,600
and receive my father to Zhaodu.

108
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,560
Are you worried about your father?

109
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,630
Is it because of Master Fozhuan?

110
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,270
What’s the use of worrying?

111
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,160
Look,

112
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,120
this is a letter I wrote to my father.

113
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,510
Can you dispatch someone

114
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,800
to deliver it to Pingting?

115
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,310
I have sent someone to Pingting

116
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,390
to tell your father that you’re safe.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
I believe he will receive

118
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,190
the letter soon.

119
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,430
Let’s go.

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,390
I will show you around Zhaodu.

121
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,480
Linglong.

122
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,720
Welcome to Zhaodu.

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,720
How powerful is the Moon Tribe!

124
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,310
The Moon Tribe is the last barrier
for the royal family.

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,430
We have to thank Fei Tian for it.

126
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,630
Fei Tian…

127
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
I still don’t have a chance

128
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,120
to apologize to Fei Tian.

129
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,360
Master Fozhuan

130
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,510
died for his faith.

131
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,240
It is not your fault.

132
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,240
Moreover, Fei Tian is someone

133
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
who controls her emotions well.

134
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,920
Yuan Yi,

135
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,560
have you ever loved someone?

136
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,680
No.

137
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,950
If you haven’t

138
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,630
fallen in love with a girl;

139
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,240
if you haven’t anticipated so much

140
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,150
for seeing her again;

141
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,270
if you haven’t

142
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,320
vowed to abandon the world

143
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,390
just to make her happy

144
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,670
and smile;

145
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,840
or if you haven’t had the determination

146
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,150
to overcome all difficulties

147
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
just to see her.

148
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,270
If you haven’t had any of such feelings,

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,670
you will never feel

150
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,870
identified with Fei Tian.

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,630
Maybe

152
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,200
you are right.

153
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Then

154
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,670
have you had any such feelings?

155
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,200
No.

156
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,790
But I have imagined

157
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,670
and anticipated that.

158
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,030
Later,

159
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,480
I found such feelings

160
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,670
in the eyes of Fei Tian.

161
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,510
You are right.

162
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,240
What’s up?

163
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,870
What do the chimes mean?

164
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,270
The funeral of Tianqi Gang.

165
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,720
Get away.

166
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,480
Fei Tian.

167
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,200
I am already

168
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,790
fed up with

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,080
your arrogance

170
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
at the court.

171
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,870
Today,

172
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,320
you sounded the Tianqi Bell

173
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,630
without permission

174
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,080
and even intended to break into my

175
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,440
Tianqi Cemetery.

176
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,750
You have

177
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,870
gone too far.

178
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,030
I am justified

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,390
to sound the bell.

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,960
Who is in the coffin?

181
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,870
Fozhuan.

182
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,320
Fozhuan?

183
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,120
He died?

184
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,720
No hypocrisy.

185
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,240
You are liable

186
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,790
for his death in part.

187
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,840
Were it not for you,

188
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,790
he wouldn’t have left Zhaodu.

189
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,790
How did he die?

190
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,630
Does it make any difference to you?

191
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
You know it is Fozhuan.

192
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,240
Please dismiss your disciples.

193
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,240
No.

194
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,790
Fozhuan

195
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,320
is no longer a Tianqi disciple.

196
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,750
He can’t be buried in Tianqi Cemetery.

197
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,240
Do you think I wish to bury him

198
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,080
with those corrupted disciples

199
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,270
and believe in

200
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,480
the nonsense of serving God?

201
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,840
If it is his last wish,

202
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,960
I must help him fulfill it.

203
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,270
Nonsense!

204
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,320
Fozhuan

205
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,480
has abandoned his status

206
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,910
as a disciple of Tianqi.

207
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,000
He won’t be admitted

208
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,150
into Zhaodu alive,

209
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,320
nor be qualified

210
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,360
to be buried in the Tianqi Cemetery.

211
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,200
You can’t break my rules

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,790
even if you are the minister.

213
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,240
Your rules are nothing to me.

214
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
I must bury him

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,910
here today.

216
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,960
Who dares to stop me!

217
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,390
Stop her.

218
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,360
Stop!

219
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,670
Your Majesty!

220
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,030
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

221
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,030
Great to see you, Your Majesty!

222
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,320
Your Majesty!

223
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,600
Fei Tian is…

224
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,550
Fei Tian,

225
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,120
let’s go back.

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,440
Okay.

227
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
I will go back

228
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,480
after I bury Fozhuan.

229
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
I understand your feelings.

230
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,240
If you really understand,

231
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,600
don’t stop me

232
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,360
this time.

233
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,790
You haven’t changed

234
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,630
in these years.

235
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,480
You have always violated the rules

236
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,320
and lost yourself

237
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
for anything

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,240
relating to Fozhuan.

239
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,390
Yes, exactly.

240
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,790
Don’t you realize that

241
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,480
you have ruined Fozhuan

242
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,790
simply for what you have done.

243
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,480
He used to be my best disciple

244
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,750
and should have become our master.

245
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,440
But he lost his life-time glory

246
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,000
just for you.

247
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,670
Finally, he only ended up

248
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,000
in a mud-covered corpse.

249
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,240
No.

250
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,320
Fozhuan didn’t ruin his life.

251
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,080
He sacrificed his life

252
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,750
simply to deliver God to Zhaodu.

253
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,480
He is more qualified than anyone else

254
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,270
to be buried in the Tianqi Cemetery.

255
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,270
What’s God?

256
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,480
Who are you on earth?

257
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,320
-Retreat from here.
-I…

258
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,510
It is none of your business.

259
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,390
Fei Tian,

260
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,910
who is she?

261
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,390
Your Majesty.

262
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
Please take her away.

263
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,750
I won’t leave here.

264
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,790
Master Fozhuan

265
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,870
died just to save me.

266
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,840
If it is so important for him

267
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,200
to be buried in the Tianqi Cemetery,

268
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,000
it will certainly

269
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,440
be my business.

270
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,000
I am Goddess.

271
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,320
What?

272
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,790
Now, in the name of God, I order you

273
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,870
to bury Fozhuan in the Tianqi Cemetery.

274
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,600
Help me.

275
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Help me.

276
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,670
Hungry?

277
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,670
This is the dish I have prepared for you
at the request of the Marquis.

278
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,270
I know it.

279
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,600
It is called the Last Meal,

280
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,200
isn’t it?

281
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
It is never so easy

282
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,670
to kill me through poisoning.

283
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,440
It is a misunderstanding.

284
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,550
The Marquis never uses poisons.

285
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,910
It is a great tonic.

286
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,150
It is a rare chance

287
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,750
for common people to have it.

288
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,390
This tonic works to

289
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,120
make you fitter

290
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,360
and smarter.

291
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,480
Moreover,

292
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,960
all your sensory organs

293
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:50,720
will become

294
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,480
even more acute.

295
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:54,910
When the Marquis

296
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
is exercising any punishment on you,

297
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
you won’t faint away immediately.

298
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,080
I…

299
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,360
What is the sound?

300
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,870
It doesn’t sound like a human being.

301
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,840
It is a sound of a brass bull.

302
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,360
Brass bull?

303
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:14,960
Exactly.

304
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,550
Cast a big hollow bull

305
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,360
with brasses.

306
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,720
The Marquis

307
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,750
puts a man into the bull’s belly

308
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,390
and a fire basin under it.

309
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,550
When the brass bull is heated up,

310
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,510
the man will have

311
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,120
a miserable experience in it.

312
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,960
His screams

313
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,240
will be amplified via the bull head

314
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,910
and sound like the screams

315
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,080
as you’re hearing.

316
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,910
Listen, listen.

317
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,200
Listen to this sound.

318
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,910
Do you want to see it?

319
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,720
What on earth

320
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,910
does the Marquis want?

321
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,600
Ask him to visit me here

322
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,910
or take me to him.

323
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,320
-Marquis Pingjiang is coming!
-I…

324
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Don’t make a fuss

325
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,030
without the Marquis’ permission.

326
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,440
Just answer his questions.

327
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,510
Got it?

328
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,790
Okay?

329
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,150
Greetings to Your Highness.

330
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,790
Are you Zhu Xi?

331
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,080
What do you want?

332
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,960
Do my daughter and I know you?

333
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,600
What on earth do you want then?

334
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,390
Why are you looking for my daughter?

335
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,670
I am talking to you.

336
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,000
Is there
any misunderstandings between us?

337
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,150
Make it clear if so.

338
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,550
If you have any questions,

339
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,480
just go and ask

340
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,360
Weisheng Yan.

341
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,030
He certainly knows it all.

342
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,510
Buddy!

343
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,000
Is the Marquis deaf?

344
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,800
Hushed!

345
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,310
No?

346
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,590
Do you hear me?

347
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,440
It is too noisy.

348
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,030
What is that?

349
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,160
What are you doing?

350
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,160
What are you doing?

351
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,310
You…

352
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,510
You…

353
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,590
What on earth are you doing?

354
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,480
Why is this comb so blunt?

355
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,000
Even if a person is washed

356
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,240
with boiling water for three times,

357
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,110
you still can’t peel his flesh

358
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,720
with this comb.

359
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,790
I will sharpen it right away.

360
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,920
I will sharpen it right away.

361
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,480
The spiked pile is full
of wooden spikes.

362
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,880
The intestines will be shredded by it.

363
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,720
Moreover,

364
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
the tongue hook

365
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,750
must be more carefully designed

366
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,590
as it is put in mouth.

367
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,000
Look at this bone saw.

368
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,030
It is already curled up.

369
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,750
The flesh will be mashed

370
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,790
before it reaches the bone.

371
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,070
Look at those mice.

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,790
They are as fat as

373
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,240
you guys are.

374
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,750
Do you think they will be interested

375
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,310
in the human beings upon release?

376
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,110
Do you use torture devices

377
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,200
like this normally?

378
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,640
My reputation

379
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,480
will just be damaged by it.

380
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,030
Take it easy, Your Highness!

381
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,240
I will find a good solution.

382
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,400
Go and check

383
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,680
if he is dead or has confessed.

384
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,750
Yes.

385
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,640
Remember,

386
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,960
be sure to clean away

387
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,880
the blood and flesh

388
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,830
in the brass bull.

389
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
He is an important guest here.

390
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,240
Take good care of him.

391
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,440
Yes.

392
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,510
Is it okay to treat an important guest
this way?

393
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,110
Do you think you can hoax

394
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,240
and fool me this way?

395
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,750
Goddess is your daughter.

396
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,310
Who dares to fool you?

397
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,830
Do you know what is most important

398
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,720
between people?

399
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,830
What is that?

400
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,070
It is trust.

401
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,790
It pays heavily

402
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,960
for two strangers

403
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,070
to trust each other.

404
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,160
I have many questions for you.

405
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,030
But without any payment,

406
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,960
how can I trust

407
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,510
what you say?

408
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

409
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,200
I hope

410
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,880
we can trust each other

411
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,400
next time when we meet.

412
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,790
Clean up the torture tools
before I come again.

413
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,310
Yes.

414
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,750
Is your daughter

415
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,830
really Goddess?

416
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,270
She isn’t Goddess at all.

417
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,510
She is just an unknown little girl.

418
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,200
Fei Tian,

419
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,640
how dare you disrespect
Goddess that way?

420
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,270
As the chief priest,

421
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,400
you will just harm the reputation

422
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,350
of Tianqi if you pay tribute

423
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,590
before further confirmation.

424
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,160
How did you find her?

425
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,200
You purposefully covered the reason

426
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,590
of His Majesty’s long absence
from the court

427
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,720
simply because of it, right?

428
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,270
It has nothing to do with you.

429
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,790
If she is really Goddess,

430
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,720
has there been anything else more

431
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,920
important to me and the Tianqi Gang

432
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,830
in the past five hundred years?

433
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,310
It is just her allegation.

434
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,270
In the past hundreds of years,

435
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,240
many fake Gods and Goddesses

436
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,550
have been decapitated

437
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,480
on the scaffold of Zhaodu.

438
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,440
There isn’t any God in the world.

439
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,160
It is just

440
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,110
an illusion

441
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,750
of old diehards like you

442
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,110
in the divine palace.

443
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,200
Fei Tian,

444
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,350
how dare you

445
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,680
profane Goddess with such words?

446
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,960
With the arrival of Goddess,

447
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,510
Suchuan will be revived.

448
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,000
It is good news

449
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,680
to be celebrated by all of us.

450
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,350
But you just

451
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,070
doubted about Goddess.

452
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,480
Are you doubting about

453
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,270
His Majesty too?

454
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,590
Can the revival of Suchuan

455
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,550
be realized by

456
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,750
old diehards like you

457
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,790
who keep praying in the divine palace?

458
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,680
It is all because of

459
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,160
His Majesty’s diligence,

460
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,160
the royal guards’ royalty

461
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,550
and also

462
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,030
the Moon Tribe people’s

463
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,830
dedicated efforts in various states.

464
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,000
Only through their efforts

465
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,590
can the vassals

466
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,030
returned to Zhaodu

467
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,590
Revival of Suchuan

468
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,830
and our great success

469
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,550
can never rely on

470
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,310
Gods or ghosts.

471
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,920
Fei Tian,

472
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,030
you keep talking about such nonsense

473
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,350
for fear of His Majesty’s reluctance

474
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,510
to rely on the Moon Tribe
and deprival of your powers

475
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,200
upon Goddess’s return to Suchuan.

476
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,440
I am afraid

477
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,240
it is because you

478
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,750
see the hope

479
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,160
of gaining powers again.

480
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,160
It is Goddess’ power.

481
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,640
It is beyond our control,

482
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,960
and your doubt.

483
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,270
I see.

484
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,640
What do you see?

485
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,030
Master Fozhuan protected me

486
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,680
out of his faith.

487
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
They strived for me

488
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,960
just for power.

489
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,240
My father is right.

490
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,590
Why are you looking at me that way?

491
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,830
I didn’t expect you had such an idea.

492
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,400
Do you think

493
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,350
I am just a foolish girl

494
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,720
who is completely ignorant?

495
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,720
Fei Tian isn’t a powerful minister.

496
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
She did it just to protect me,

497
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,440
so did the chief priest.

498
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,830
Since my childhood,

499
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,070
the chief priest has taught me

500
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,160
everything about God.

501
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,000
So who do you support?

502
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,310
Who do I support?

503
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,110
Who do you support,

504
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,160
Fei Tian or the chief priest?

505
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,880
As the emperor,

506
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,030
I shouldn’t use anyone simply out of
my personal preference.

507
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,160
I must listen to others’ opinions

508
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,030
and maintain balance.

509
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,790
I see.

510
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,590
I choose Fei Tian.

511
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,110
What?

512
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,920
The chief priest has blind trusts
in Goddess

513
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,750
and can hardly be impartial.

514
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,750
Fei Tian doubts about me.

515
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,160
It is good

516
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,960
because I don’t know

517
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,200
what Goddess really means

518
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,160
and what Goddess can do.

519
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,550
If I can convince Fei Tian,

520
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,640
I will convince myself better.

521
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,240
I didn’t expect

522
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,550
you really didn’t choose someone

523
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,440
out of your personal preference.

524
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,400
What is your plan then?

525
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,030
That is just your Goddess.

526
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,110
She isn’t Goddess of Suchuan.

527
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Nonsense!

528
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,240
This girl is Goddess!

529
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:50,960
-You said she was…
-Stop quarreling.

530
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,200
Your Majesty!

531
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,920
Your Majesty!

Allow Linglong to prove

534
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,030
if Goddess is true or false.

535
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,160
How can she prove it?

536
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,790
Ritual of Eternity.

537
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,680
Ritual of Eternity

538
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,000
is the best way
to reveal the trails of God.

539
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,070
If Linglong can illuminate

540
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,000
the Pillar of Eternity of Zhaodu,

541
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,000
she can not only prove herself,

542
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,790
but declare to all people of Suchuan

543
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,070
that Goddess

544
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,640
has come again.

545
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,160
No.

546
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960
I honor your order, Your Majesty!

547
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,310
I will do it right away.

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,880
Immediately!

549
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,920
Your Majesty,

550
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,350
it is not a joke.

551
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,240
I have seen Linglong lighting up the

552
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,440
Pillar of Eternity of the Fire Tribe.

553
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,310
Trust me.

554
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,750
It is time to show to

555
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,240
the unruly vassals

556
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,440
that the emperor of Suchuan

557
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,350
has cooperated

558
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,550
with Goddess

559
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,590
again.

560
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,030
Your Majesty,

561
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,750
how did the chief priest

562
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,110
fool you?

563
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,270
Why are you so stubborn?

564
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,590
Don’t you find

565
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,880
anything strange in it?

566
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,440
Why did the chief priest

567
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,680
suddenly lead you to the Fire Tribe?

568
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,720
Why did Zhu Xi show up there?

569
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,720
Isn’t there any plots

570
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,270
behind so many coincidences?

571
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,440
Moreover,

572
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,200
how can you trust

573
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,310
an unknown little girl

574
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,510
and ignore

575
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,960
the security of Suchuan?

576
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
You are Goddess.

577
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,720
Prove to me right now.

578
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,880
I…

579
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,790
Now I am

580
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,270
not very good at it.

581
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,110
Little girl,

582
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,400
you should take a second thought.

583
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,350
If you fail to light up
the Pillar of Eternity

584
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,720
at the Ritual of Eternity,

585
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,110
I will kill you.

586
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,350
Yuan Yi has told me.

587
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,510
I will make preparations.

588
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Good job.

589
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,000
But the Ritual of Eternity

590
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,960
is never a possibility.

591
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,640
Linglong.

592
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,070
Why don’t you agree?

593
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,510
Please allow me to have a try.

594
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,640
Whatever consequences there may be,

595
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,590
I will bear them myself.

596
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,480
Do you think I will care about you?

597
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Why don’t you agree then?

598
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,510
I know

599
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,590
you hate me because of

600
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,240
the death of Master Fozhuan.

601
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,400
But he sacrificed his life

602
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,350
to deliver me to Zhaodu.

603
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,110
So please give me a chance

604
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,680
at least to prove he didn’t die in vain.

605
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,640
Do you think I am angry with you

606
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
because of Fozhuan’s death?

607
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,640
If Fozhuan didn’t sacrifice his life

608
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,400
to protect you,

609
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,350
I would have decapitated you

610
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,920
and asked a guard to put it on the spear

611
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,110
to show to everybody of Suchuan.

612
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,070
I want everyone

613
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,270
in Suchuan to see it clearly

614
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,310
and to make sure nobody dares

615
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,880
to play such a trick again.

616
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,310
You won’t scare me!

617
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,000
I won’t give up!

618
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,960
I won’t give up.

619
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,200
Never.

620
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,830
Go and prepare the logs

621
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,030
and kerosene.

622
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,920
The Marquis will come at any time.

623
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,510
Yes.

624
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,110
Don’t cheat me.

625
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,590
Can you really honor

626
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,960
your promise to me?

627
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,640
Otherwise,

628
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,720
I would be the one

629
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,590
in the brass bull.

630
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,110
Jia,

631
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,310
I didn’t lie to you.

632
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,000
My daughter really cured me.

633
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,000
But I can’t promise

634
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,070
she can also cure your daughter.

635
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,310
Goddess

636
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,720
is omnipotent.

637
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,110
Hushed!

638
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,920
Okay, no problem.

639
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,070
I have tried all medicines

640
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,640
to cure my daughter’s disease.

641
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,830
But

642
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,960
none of them worked.

643
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,240
My wife

644
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
died early.

645
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,590
We have a child.

646
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,350
Although

647
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,550
she survived the big plaque

648
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,720
17 years ago,

649
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,590
she developed

650
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,510
this strange disease.

651
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,240
She has endured the pains every day

652
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,030
in the past ten years and more.

653
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,070
She feels painful.

654
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,030
But I am even more painful.

655
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,350
So long as you can

656
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,960
cure her disease,

657
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,270
I would do anything for you.

658
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,590
Can I drink some water?

659
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:50,960
Okay.

660
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,720
I will fetch you some water.

661
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,030
Come on,

662
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,000
Jia,

663
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,400
do you know

664
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,310
a girl named Jin’er?

665
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,790
She is also a native of Pingting

666
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,640
but was lost 17 years ago

667
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,000
possibly

668
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,590
at the age of 18 then.

669
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,240
Well,

670
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,960
I have no idea.

671
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,960
You…

672
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,720
Please think it over.

673
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,070
Her name is Jin’er,

674
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,720
a very pretty girl.

675
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,550
Jin’er,

676
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,270
a native of Pingting

677
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,920
Well, I…

678
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,440
Don’t know.

679
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,310
Impossible!

680
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,960
If a girl is lost,

681
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,270
all our villagers will search for her

682
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,030
at our village.

683
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,240
How is it possible you have no idea?

684
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,400
Pingting has a big population.

685
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,790
It is just a girl who is lost.

686
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,680
Nobody will care even

687
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,590
all residents along a street

688
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,640
are gone.

689
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,960
Many people died at the plague

690
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,590
17 years ago.

691
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,030
The street was full of orphans.

692
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,480
It is not a big deal

693
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,310
that a girl

694
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,750
was lost then.

695
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,160
Have you ever

696
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,720
seen a big monster in Pingting?

697
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,790
A monster with horns on head

698
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,270
and shells on body,

699
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,350
whose screams

700
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,000
are unbearable to the human being.

701
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,400
Well, I…

702
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,160
I don’t know.

703
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,880
Drink water.

704
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,000
Drink some more water.

705
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,350
Somebody must know it other than me.

706
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,510
So long as your daughter,

707
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,240
no, so long as Goddess
saves my daughter,

708
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,550
I will excavate the corpse of anyone

709
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,400
who died some hundred years ago

710
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,790
for you, let alone finding a girl.

711
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,350
Quieter, quieter!

712
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,070
Quieter!

713
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,030
Thank you.

714
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,830
Let’s escape first.

715
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:46,960
Okay.

716
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,830
Hold on for a little more while.

717
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,310
I will be back tonight.

718
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,550
Take good care of yourself.

719
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,240
Okay.

720
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,310
I hope there is still time for it.

721
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,110
Dispatch the fastest pigeon

722
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,830
to notify various local Tianqi’s priests

723
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,830
and declare

724
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,480
on the Ritual of Eternity.

725
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,510
I must make it known

726
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,790
to all people of Suchuan

727
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,590
that Goddess

728
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,310
will come again soon.

729
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,200
But Fei Tian…

730
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,750
Forget her.

731
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,160
Goddess will naturally dispel

732
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,110
all doubts.

733
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,160
I am afraid the pigeon may be

734
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,270
intercepted by the Moon Guards.

735
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,640
What?

736
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,590
Your new divine music score was

737
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,270
intercepted on the way to Pingting.

738
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,270
My brothers and I were interrogated

739
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,750
by the Moon Guards one by one.

740
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,110
It was hard to finally convince them

741
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,310
it was just a score

742
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,400
instead of any secret signals.

743
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,880
Release all pigeons then.

744
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,880
I don’t think the Moon Guards

745
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,960
can intercept them all.

746
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,440
That is really too much.

747
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,000
Yes.

748
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,400
Goddess?

749
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,830
Go away.

750
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,840
Goddess!

751
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,440
Chief priest!

752
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,710
What can I do for you, Goddess?

753
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,880
May I show you
around the divine palace

754
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,960
and tell you the great achievements
of the historic Gods?

755
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,670
Or…

756
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,320
You don’t have to.

757
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,280
I have come here for one thing.

758
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,360
Bury Master Fozhuan in Tianqi Cemetery.

759
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,880
Well…

760
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,880
Are there any problems?

761
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,880
Tianqi abides by the divine doctrines

762
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,070
and I never dare to violate them.

763
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,960
But Fozhuan

764
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,030
chose to be exiled

765
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,480
and he isn’t qualified

766
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,630
to serve Gods and Goddesses.

767
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,710
Will you dishonor

768
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,510
the order of Goddess?

769
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,070
No, no.

770
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I say he is qualified.

771
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,960
You are just Goddess of me

772
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,480
instead of all people of Suchuan now.

773
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,510
Even Fei Tian…

774
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,710
Is it a deal between you and me?

775
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,230
No, no.

776
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,880
Sorry, Goddess.

777
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,070
Is there any other way out?

778
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,480
Unless

779
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,480
Fozhuan is qualified as a God servant.

780
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,360
Who is a God servant?

781
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,960
Anyone who believes in God

782
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,760
and is enlightened by God can be

783
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,070
buried in Tianqi Cemetery after death.

784
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,000
Moreover,

785
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,630
a God servant enjoys a higher grade

786
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,670
of funeral than the chief priest.

787
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,110
Master Fozhuan is certainly enlightened

788
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
and he is a God servant.

789
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
He needs to prove himself.

790
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,440
He is dead now.

791
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,030
How can he prove himself?

792
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,670
God will leave a message.

793
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,670
It is just pure empty talk

794
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
from you.

795
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Sorry, Goddess.

796
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,070
Goddess,

797
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,550
don’t be angry.

798
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,190
After the Ritual of Eternity,

799
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,630
all the people of Suchuan

800
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,550
will be at your service.

801
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,510
I must get Fei Tian’s approval first.

802
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,190
Am I Goddess

803
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,030
or not?

804
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,360
They just expect me
to receive the approval of Fei Tian.

805
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,000
They are all

806
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
so shrewd.

807
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,670
Linglong,

808
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,670
have you visited the chief priest?

809
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,070
How did you know it?

810
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,400
The peach is a tribute
of the Tianqi Gang.

811
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,630
But

812
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,360
I always believe the chief priest loves

813
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,280
to eat it personally.

814
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,230
I…

815
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,840
They keep a close eye on me now.

816
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,960
Fei Tian must feel very angry to know

817
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
you left the palace for me.

818
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,920
If my father had such a team,

819
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
I would also have a long tail behind me

820
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,760
wherever I go.

821
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,480
Do you like it?

822
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,590
I can organize a team of guards for you.

823
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,960
No, no.

824
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,400
I can protect myself.

825
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,800
Tell me.

826
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,280
What did the chief priest say?

827
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,030
He said nothing.

828
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,440
He is a firm believer
in the divine doctrines

829
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,840
and always abides by the gang rules.

830
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,960
It is never possible

831
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,230
to change his faith.

832
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,440
How did you put it there?

833
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,110
Use a crystal blunderbuss.

834
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,960
What’s up?

835
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,320
Crystal blunderbuss?

836
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,590
It sounds

837
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,070
okay.

838
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,150
But

839
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,550
can you do it?

840
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,590
I…

841
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,360
This apparel

842
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,190
only works to make me an ornament.

843
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
May I ask them to…?

844
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:20,630
Take it for me.

845
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,110
Close your eyes and turn around!

846
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,280
Linglong,

847
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,190
what are you doing?

848
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,190
What are you doing? You scared me.

849
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,510
Please

850
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
pull down your dress first.

851
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,960
Wait a minute.

852
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,440
Okay.

853
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,000
Linglong,

854
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,280
it is not the Fire Tribe.

855
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,400
I know.

856
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,840
It is Zhaodu.

857
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,190
It is your territory.

858
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,550
They must obey you.

859
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,480
I finally understand
the worries of your father.

860
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,360
Look.

861
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,150
Within one hundred steps,

862
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,710
I can throw a Stone Freezing Ball

863
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,360
into the bowl-size center of fire.

864
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,400
I have prepared it for 16 years

865
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,150
in order to join the Mountain Team.

866
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,710
Okay.

867
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,360
Then,

868
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,280
please make your orders.

869
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,880
Are you okay?

870
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,920
Don’t speak later.

871
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,110
Your voice is easily identified.

872
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,510
Can you manage it?

873
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:36,800
Nothing can stop me

874
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,400
in my life.

875
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,360
Let’s go.

876
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,320
We are coming
for two crystal blunderbusses

877
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,590
and two crystal letters.

878
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:02,960
Show me the approval.

879
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,000
Wait.

880
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,190
What is that?

881
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,710
How dare you ask for them

882
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,800
without knowing the approval?

883
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,190
Don’t you have one?

884
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,960
I can issue one to myself.

885
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,360
Do you have the approval?

886
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
Without an approval,

887
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,590
you won’t take anything away from me.

888
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:40,590
Let’s go first.

889
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:45,630
Wait a minute.

890
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,110
Bro,

891
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,440
do you still remember how Minister Fei

892
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,510
was angry When His Majesty sneaked

893
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,510
out of the palace?

894
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,760
Of course, I remember.

895
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,360
All the guards

896
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,800
were punished in the imperial city.

897
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,070
My leader was directly dismissed

898
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,760
and returned home for farming

899
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,280
even if he had guarded

900
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,440
the imperial city for decades.

901
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,670
I have a secret message for you.

902
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,760
His Majesty is gone again.

903
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,030
What?

904
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,840
Why did you tell me the message?

905
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,030
I am just a warehouse keeper.

906
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,710
It is no use telling me.

907
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:35,960
His Majesty is absent

908
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,400
and we can’t get the approval.

909
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,590
But we are in a hurry to deliver
the message and find His Majesty.

910
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,800
You know the truth now but

911
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,760
you refuse to give us
the crystal letters.

912
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:43,710
If Minister Fei must

913
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,480
hold someone responsible one day,

914
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,510
I am afraid

915
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,550
you may be the one.

916
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,110
Okay, okay,

917
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,480
I will give them to you right away.
