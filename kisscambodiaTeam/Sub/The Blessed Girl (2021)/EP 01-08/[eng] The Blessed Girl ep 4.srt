00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,870
Linglong!

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,190
Get her!

26
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,750
Take me hostage!

27
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,400
Hurry! Take me hostage!

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,030
Stop!

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,960
Don’t… Don’t move!

30
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,870
Don’t move!

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,520
Put your swords down!

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,280
Now what?

33
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:25,910
Leave here!

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,560
Go!

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,030
Move away!

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,000
Back off!

37
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,430
You okay?

38
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,190
Follow me.

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,400
Move away!

40
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,120
Hurry!

41
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,800
Go!

42
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,120
Linglong,

43
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,920
you’re awake.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,390
Father.

45
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,120
How do you feel, Linglong?

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,040
You alright?

47
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,390
Are you still feeling unwell?

48
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,390
We did it?

49
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,870
Great!

50
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,270
Are my tribesmen alright?

51
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
They’re alright.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,360
Great!

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,240
Brat,

54
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,950
now she’s fine.

55
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,870
Why are you

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,800
still holding her hands?

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
What do you want?

58
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,680
What about you?

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,870
How long do you want to hug me?

60
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,270
Who is she?

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,750
I don’t know her.

62
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,160
Who do you work for?

63
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,920
I work for you.

64
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,360
Don’t talk nonsense.

65
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,310
Then who is she?

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,040
I don’t know her.

67
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,360
Why did you help us?

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,390
To

69
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
make you owe me one.

70
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,950
What do you want me to do?

71
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Can you heal his wound?

72
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,240
You’re injured, Father?

73
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,040
I’m fine.

74
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,720
It’s just

75
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,600
a scratch.

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
You call this a scratch?

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,390
It’s fine. It’s fine.

78
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,950
Let me take a look.

79
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,600
You see?

80
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,920
My daughter has grown up.

81
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,360
She cares so much about me.

82
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,800
It’s really good.

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,070
Knock it off.

84
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,800
Don’t move.

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,240
Let me take a look.

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,680
You know what?

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Some herbs are all I need

88
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,680
to heal the wound.

89
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,830
There’s no need to worry about it.

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,360
Can you heal it?

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,830
She didn’t know how to do it.

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,310
I

93
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,680
might

94
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,800
not be able to do that now.

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,920
It’s alright. It’s alright.

96
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,830
When can you do it then?

97
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,600
I’m not sure about that.

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,000
Good girl.

99
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,430
My skin is thick.

100
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,720
I’ll recover in two days.

101
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,360
I’ll pick some herbs
in the mountains myself.

102
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,160
Forget it then.

103
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,070
Now you’ve got no use

104
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,040
for me at all.

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,070
I’m fine.

106
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,680
It’s alright. It’s alright.

107
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,000
You can

108
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,120
pay me back in the future.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,510
You should go now!

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,190
The soldiers will be here soon.

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,390
However,

112
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,390
where can you go?

113
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,750
I’m afraid you can’t
go back to Fire Tribe now.

114
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,390
This medicine can heal your wound.

115
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,430
I guarantee your skin will become

116
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,480
as delicate as before.

117
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,720
I’ll go back then.

118
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,430
Don’t forget me.

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,270
Only... Only a fool will believe you!

120
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,070
Damn your medicine!

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,390
What’s the relationship

122
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:17,870
between you two?

123
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,190
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,870
You were wearing

125
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,830
a different outfit yesterday.

126
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,390
So many things happened,

127
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,430
yet you still had time
to change your clothes?

128
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,160
I changed my clothes because...

129
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
What are you implying?

130
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,160
Speaking of which,

131
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
what’s your relationship?

132
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,310
Why did he come back?

133
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,600
Brat,

134
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,360
you didn’t take my words

135
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
seriously at all, did you?

136
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,600
Father,

137
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,800
Yuan Yi helped me save you.

138
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,240
Him?

139
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,160
Again!

140
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,390
Not a big deal!

141
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,310
We’re not safe yet.

142
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,920
Let’s leave here first.

143
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,750
Leave here?

144
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,600
Is it that simple?

145
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,600
Where can we go?

146
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,070
We can’t even go home now.

147
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,190
It was all your fault.

148
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,950
We can...

149
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,870
How about we

150
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,750
hide in the Wall for a while?

151
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,920
Father,

152
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,270
we’re not going back to the Fire Tribe.

153
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,390
Then where are we going?

154
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,510
Leader has had it all arranged.

155
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,480
Chi Fang!

156
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,150
There you are!

157
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,480
Chi Fang,

158
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,840
where are the other tribesmen?

159
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,080
Are they alright?

160
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,550
Don’t worry.

161
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,390
All of them are alright.

162
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,030
Leader has found a safe place

163
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,790
for them to stay.

164
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,750
Those bad guys

165
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,670
will not find them.

166
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,720
That’s great.

167
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,200
Hasn't the ship arrived yet?

168
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,840
Not yet.

169
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,550
Ship?

170
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,960
What ship?

171
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,630
What are inside the boxes?

172
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,790
Those are Flammable Stones

173
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,840
to be sold.

174
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
We’re waiting for the buyer’s ship.

175
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,440
We can hide in the ship

176
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,600
and then leave here.

177
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,720
You!

178
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,000
What is that?

179
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,870
How come the fish is flying?

180
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,320
That’s a ship of Weisheng Yan’s.

181
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,480
Only the Weisheng family

182
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
has a ship like this in Suchuan.

183
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,910
A flying ship?

184
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,630
Who is Weisheng Yan?

185
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,270
The richest man in Suchuan.

186
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,870
A fish that can fly?

187
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,240
I never knew there were
such things in the world.

188
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,750
Suchuan is very big.

189
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,510
There’re many wonders you don’t know.

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,390
I’ll show you around.

191
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,550
I also want to take a look.

192
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,240
Um…

193
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,240
You can sneak in

194
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,270
when we load up the ship later.

195
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,120
Where are we going?

196
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,510
Did I permit it?

197
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,360
Did you ask my opinion?

198
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,080
Father,

199
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,240
I know that

200
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,030
you disagree to this,

201
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,150
but,

202
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,080
are you willing to let me
board the ship alone?

203
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,390
If I stay here,

204
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,480
I’d put the whole tribe

205
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,510
in danger.

206
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Everyone will help me

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,030
if I want to leave.

208
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,320
You can’t stop me.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
Then I’ll try and see if I can.

210
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,080
Alright. Alright.

211
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,840
Huotu Xin,

212
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,000
Linglong has already

213
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,240
grown up.

214
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Bug off.

215
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,600
Don’t make trouble.

216
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,000
You!

217
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,240
It’s all right.

218
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,840
Linglong,

219
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,150
I want to say sorry to you

220
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,630
about the Earth Fire Test.

221
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,120
I haven’t given up yet.

222
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,390
I’ll definitely find the way

223
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,480
to extinguish the Earth Fire.

224
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,510
Good.

225
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,200
Here.

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Your sword.

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,600
Take it.

228
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,750
Thank you.

229
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,030
Sorry for what we’ve done to you.

230
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,720
It’ll be a tiring journey.

231
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,440
Be careful.

232
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,000
Father!

233
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,000
Don’t try to leave me behind

234
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,000
no matter where you go.

235
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,030
I never thought about that!

236
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,030
But how’re we supposed

237
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,870
to board the ship?

238
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,670
Over here.

239
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,150
Be careful!

240
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,720
Okay.

241
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,200
Be careful!

242
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,510
Okay.

243
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,200
Be gentle!

244
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,750
What if you break them?

245
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,150
Over here.

246
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
Put this on the top.

247
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,600
Be gentle!

248
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,670
Okay. Okay.

249
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,150
Be gentler.

250
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,910
Seems this one’s very heavy.

251
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,840
Sir,

252
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,360
the stones are all here.

253
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
You said you don’t want money.

254
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,910
How can I explain it to my master?

255
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,960
It’s all right.

256
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,910
Leader said

257
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,840
it’d be all alright

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
if you can bring the rest of the things

259
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,270
on the list to us next time.

260
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,750
Our tribe

261
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,120
seldom interacts with outsiders.

262
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,000
We have no use for money.

263
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,000
Fine.

264
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,320
I’ll tell our master this when I’m back.

265
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,030
Okay.

266
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,240
Our tribe

267
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,510
hasn’t been at peace lately.

268
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,750
You should depart soon

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
if there’s nothing else to do.

270
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,200
Okay.

271
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,750
Please be quiet.

272
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,550
Miss Yin doesn’t feel well.

273
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,630
She just fell asleep.

274
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,440
Okay.

275
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,360
Sorry. Sorry.

276
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:39,960
Never mind.

277
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,870
I have several guests
from Bright Moon Island.

278
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,200
I’ll go take a look.

279
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,720
Go ahead.

280
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,960
It’ll be a bumpy journey.

281
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,840
Please be careful!

282
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,600
Father.

283
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,000
Over here.

284
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,510
Help me!

285
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,630
Brat, you’re so immoral!

286
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:22,870
Hide!

287
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,030
Search the ship!

288
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,000
Search the ship!

289
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,790
Yes!

290
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,320
Who are you?

291
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,480
None of your business.

292
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,670
Do you know whose ship this is?

293
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,200
Who cares?

294
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,790
What are you doing?

295
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,550
Let him be.

296
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,840
Just search the ship.

297
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,440
It’s her again!

298
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:24,960
Hurry!

299
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,000
Make room! Make room!

300
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,360
Make room! Make room!

301
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,080
I can’t close it, Father!

302
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,390
Do you still remember who I am?

303
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,360
You...

304
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,480
Someone!

305
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,600
-Go inside to search!
-Shh!

306
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,910
No one’s here!

307
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,590
Yes!

308
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,550
What about now?

309
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,750
You owe me another one.

310
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,110
Now you know who’s reliable,

311
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,270
and who treats you well, right?

312
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,510
Wait a minute.

313
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,110
What’s your name?

314
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,750
Wu Yuan.

315
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,030
Did you find them?

316
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,750
No.

317
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,590
Keep searching.

318
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,110
Yes!

319
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,550
Can you keep it quiet?

320
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,000
You woke Miss Yin up.

321
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,550
Nothing.

322
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
Not even a dead mouse.

323
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,270
Keep searching.

324
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,640
Weisheng Yan’s ship

325
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,440
appeared here for no reason.

326
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,160
There must be something fishy.

327
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,750
Why don’t you search them yourself?

328
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,110
What?

329
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,480
You’re afraid of that little girl?

330
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,640
Report!

331
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,110
We’ve found nothing.

332
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,720
I told you to keep it quiet!

333
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,640
Can’t you understand?

334
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,920
Who the heck are you?

335
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,590
Bug off!

336
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,030
What?

337
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,480
You should use honorifics

338
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,240
when talking to the elderly.

339
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,880
Don’t you know?

340
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,480
My sister is resting.

341
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,480
If you don’t know

342
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,550
how to keep quiet,

343
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,790
I can teach you.

344
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,750
Xiao,

345
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,110
I’m fine.

346
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,030
Don’t fight with them.

347
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,510
It’s windy outside.

348
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,720
You should go inside.

349
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,830
So handsome!

350
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,110
Who is he exactly?

351
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,980
<i>Not long ago</i>

352
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,240
Xiao,

353
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,030
can I change

354
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,270
my hairstyle?

355
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,000
You don’t like it?

356
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,240
It’s the hairstyle Mother taught us.

357
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,480
I just want to

358
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,000
try a new one.

359
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,830
But this is

360
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,350
the only one I can do.

361
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,510
Juan.

362
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,750
Come on in.

363
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,680
Greetings!

364
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,880
My master is so lucky!

365
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,480
Is my hairstyle

366
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,070
a bit outdated?

367
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,070
It’s indeed

368
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,350
not the most fashionable hairstyle

369
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,720
in Pingting.

370
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:41,960
What is it?

371
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,790
Here’s the thing.

372
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,200
Our ship

373
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,510
will stop by the Fire Tribe’s

374
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,880
White Forest Lake later.

375
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,070
We’ll pick up some goods

376
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,240
and take them to Pingting.

377
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,960
Yin Zhuang has a head disease.

378
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,590
She doesn’t feel comfortable on ship.

379
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,790
I hope we don’t stop

380
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,830
during the journey.

381
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,070
This...

382
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,590
Our ship

383
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,070
is indeed poorly adorned.

384
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,790
It’s too shabby for the future

385
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,400
female master of the Weisheng family.

386
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,000
Please bear with it.

387
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,960
We don’t need your ship

388
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,270
to manifest our nobility.

389
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,400
Yes!

390
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,880
Yes!

391
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,030
Besides the Yuan family,

392
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,310
no families in Suchuan

393
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,640
are qualified to

394
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,830
hold a candle to the Yin family.

395
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,400
You!

396
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,640
Tell me your name!

397
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,720
Yin Xiao

398
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,000
from the Yin family.

399
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,030
What did he say?

400
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,440
I think he said

401
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
the Yin family.

402
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,110
Xiao,

403
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,160
stop fighting.

404
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,680
I’m going to get married.

405
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,310
I shouldn’t see too much blood.

406
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,550
I’ll be back in a moment.

407
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,200
I’ll wait for you here then.

408
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,880
I came to arrest people

409
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,270
on Zhu Xi, Marquis Pingjiang’s order.

410
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,920
Forgive me for offending the descendants

411
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,830
of the Yin family.

412
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,440
We’re on the land of the Fire Tribe.

413
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,440
Since when

414
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,240
Marquis Pingjiang got to govern it?

415
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,960
Seems you’ve been away for too long.

416
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,830
I heard the Yin descendants

417
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,000
wandered across many remote islands,

418
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,550
so it’s understandable you’re not

419
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,270
familiar with the current situation

420
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,510
of Suchuan.

421
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,240
I guess

422
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,920
you’re going to Pingting, right?

423
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,960
How about this?

424
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,400
You can come to me

425
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,480
whenever you need anything.

426
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,510
If we had a chance to meet again...

427
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,200
Xiao!

428
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,590
Miss Yin,

429
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,350
your brother knows what he’s doing.

430
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,750
Go ahead if you still want to

431
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,880
search the ship,

432
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,550
but please keep it quiet.

433
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,550
No need.

434
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,000
I believe this is a misunderstanding.

435
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,680
Alright then.

436
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
See you again.

437
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,920
There are such people out there!

438
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,680
Shh.

439
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,350
Lower your voice.

440
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,160
Look

441
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,680
how ignorant you are!

442
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,750
You know them?

443
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,000
I didn’t expect the Yin family

444
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,030
has a descendant like him.

445
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,110
What’s special

446
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,310
about the Yin family?

447
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,200
It’s one of the oldest families
in Suchuan.

448
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,920
It’s also known as a divine tribe,

449
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,680
along with the Yuan and Li families.

450
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,110
The Yin family once held the position

451
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,960
of Judicial Director.

452
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,110
They can

453
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,640
perceive the emotions of others

454
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,750
and even control their wills.

455
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,200
It’s said that

456
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,750
no guilty person

457
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,510
can escape their judgement.

458
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,720
That’s why

459
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,310
he could control that sword

460
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,240
at will?

461
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,070
Control others?

462
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,880
Then isn’t he just like

463
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,960
that weirdo with a stone
embedded on his head?

464
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,030
You mean Gu Shi?

465
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,720
Those are

466
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,640
imitators of the Yin tribesmen.

467
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,350
They rely on implanted objects
in their bodies

468
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,880
to enhance a certain strength.

469
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,680
But the Yin tribesmen are different.

470
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,790
It’s flowing in their blood.

471
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,680
It’s a born strength inherited from God.

472
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,510
Innate.

473
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,640
It’s undoubted.

474
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,830
Just like you.

475
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,350
But after the Fall of God,

476
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,920
the Yin family’s power also disappeared

477
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,830
and they gradually met their downfall.

478
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,480
Only an

479
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,550
ancient noble surname was left.

480
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,550
Then,

481
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,240
will he take your orders?

482
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,030
We will no longer

483
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,350
need to hide here

484
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,310
if we have his help.

485
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,590
I have control over things in Zhaodu,

486
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,920
but not things

487
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
outside of Zhaodu.

488
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,510
Who on earth are you?

489
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,880
Now you want to know?

490
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,830
The journey is still very long.

491
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,880
I’ll tell you later.

492
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,200
Father,

493
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,680
it’s going up!

494
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,200
Have you seen it?

495
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,640
You let them go like this?

496
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,400
Even if the Yin family has waned,

497
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,240
you still

498
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,000
have no confidence to beat him.

499
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,070
I indeed have no confidence.

500
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,160
If the descendants of the Yin family
go to Pingting,

501
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:06,960
they’ll

502
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,000
pose a threat to the Marquis.

503
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,720
But they’ve left,

504
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,510
in a flying ship.

505
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,750
A flying ship?

506
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,830
It’s easier to kill them in the sky.

507
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,000
Get up.

508
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,070
Here is a knife

509
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,070
that can cause thunderstorms.

510
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,550
Go to Scale Valley

511
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,550
and knock down the ship.

512
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,880
Keep the man from the Fire Tribe alive.

513
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,160
He’s useful.

514
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,790
Scale Valley?

515
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,440
Evil Souls hang around out there.

516
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,750
There’s also something you’re afraid of?

517
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,920
Mortals are all
afraid of the Evil Souls.

518
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,880
What if

519
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,750
the girl is really on the ship?

520
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,640
The Marquis wants her alive.

521
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,880
Will Goddess die that easily?

522
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,200
Don’t you

523
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,400
want to see how capable she is?

524
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,780
<i>Hold. It’s this girl.</i>

525
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,270
That’s how it went.

526
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,480
I secretly left Zhaodu
and came to the Fire Tribe

527
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,790
after hearing the words
of Tianqi’s chief priest.

528
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,270
I didn’t expect

529
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,270
I would actually find Linglong.

530
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,070
Well,

531
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,440
how did you find the Palace of Flames?

532
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
In the library of Zhaodu,

533
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,590
there’re many books about

534
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,310
the Fire Tribe.

535
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,240
I can remember everything I see,

536
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,310
be it text or maps.

537
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,680
Now you know?

538
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,160
I’m an emperor in Suchuan.

539
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,270
Just ignore him.

540
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,270
He’s never been

541
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,720
so far away from home.

542
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,550
Right.

543
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,510
I’ve never left our home,

544
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,790
and I never wanted to leave.

545
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,440
You’ve seen

546
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,790
how scary those people

547
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,240
who came to the Fire Tribe were!

548
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,920
It’s dangerous outside!

549
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,000
But,

550
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,790
there’s also a lot of fun outside.

551
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,000
And things we’ve never seen before!

552
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,440
For example,

553
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,400
this flying ship.

554
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,640
There’re also good people

555
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,030
out there.

556
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,590
For example,

557
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,920
Yuan Yi.

558
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,640
Don’t worry.

559
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,440
I’ll protect you.

560
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,240
Zhaodu will be your new home.

561
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,920
We don’t need your protection.

562
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,270
I also don’t trust you.

563
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,680
If you don’t trust Yuan Yi,

564
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,240
why do you trust that woman?

565
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,030
When did I trust her?

566
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,510
You don’t?

567
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,480
Then why did you use this medicine?

568
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,350
I... I...

569
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,790
You applied the medicine
for me, alright?

570
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,680
By the way,

571
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,270
don’t trust him so easily.

572
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,510
If he really is an emperor,

573
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,880
since now he’s so far away from Zhaodu,

574
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,110
those people in Zhaodu

575
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,590
would search all over Suchuan for him.

576
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,550
In fact,

577
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,110
many people in Suchuan want to

578
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,680
replace me.

579
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,400
Zhaodu couldn’t let the news out.

580
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,200
Linglong,

581
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,110
will you choose me

582
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,550
or him?

583
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,830
What are you saying, Father?

584
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,680
Isn’t it obvious?

585
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,030
Even if he is an emperor,

586
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,070
he might lose his position soon.

587
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,000
Why did he come to you?

588
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,550
He wants you to help him
keep his position.

589
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,790
He’s using you.

590
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,880
And these things

591
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,110
are all life-critical.

592
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,750
I feel scared upon the thought of it.

593
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,720
Listen,

594
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,720
if you are in any danger,

595
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,480
I’ll protect you

596
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,160
at the cost of my life.

597
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,240
I...

598
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,590
Alright.

599
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,000
I know that

600
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,270
no one could change your mind

601
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,680
if you’ve made up your mind

602
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,790
even when you were a kid.

603
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,880
So,

604
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,960
will you choose me or him?

605
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,230
Make your choice.

606
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,440
Father!

607
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,440
You got it wrong.

608
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,710
Linglong is the Goddess of Suchuan.

609
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,510
Her position is much higher

610
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,150
than mine.

611
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,150
It’s not she’s going to protect me,

612
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,480
but everyone in Suchuan is
going to protect her.

613
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,590
There’s no need to explain to him.

614
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,480
He is fooling around.

615
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,150
Father,

616
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,630
don’t you want to find out

617
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Mother’s secret?

618
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,630
Have you ever thought

619
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,070
if I really am the Goddess of Suchuan

620
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,000
like Yuan Yi said?

621
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,440
Then it’s impossible that my mother

622
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,150
was a monster.

623
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Who was she?

624
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,840
Why did she come to the Fire Tribe?

625
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,920
Where did she come from?

626
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,840
Don’t you

627
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,070
want to know?

628
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
She’s your mother.

629
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,400
Who else could she be?

630
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,320
Now only Yuan Yi can help me

631
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,630
understand the power in my body,

632
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,000
and guide me to become Goddess.

633
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,150
As long as he can help,

634
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,000
I’m sure I can find out the truth,

635
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,230
and even,

636
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,030
the way

637
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,280
to extinguish the Earth Fire.

638
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Maybe

639
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,070
that was also the reason

640
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,440
why my mother came to the Fire Tribe.

641
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,360
It’s possible.

642
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,110
Goddess is the guardian
of the entire Suchuan.

643
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,710
Right!

644
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,320
There’s no way that

645
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,070
my mother was a monster.

646
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,320
She came to our tribe

647
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,920
to help them extinguish the Earth Fire.

648
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,150
I have to prove it

649
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,480
and tell our tribesmen the truth.

650
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,110
Miss,

651
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,630
where are you from?

652
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,550
Pingting.

653
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,880
Pingting?

654
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,510
Is this ship going to Pingting?

655
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,320
Right.

656
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,800
But don’t worry.

657
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,880
Fei Tian’s secret sentinels in Pingting

658
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,150
will pick up us soon

659
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,000
and escort us to Zhaodu.

660
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,030
Let’s go to Pingting then.

661
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,190
But,

662
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,230
you have to listen to me.

663
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,760
After we arrive at Pingting,

664
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,000
I’ll find a job first.

665
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,760
Let’s keep a low profile for a while.

666
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,400
We’ll make a new plan

667
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,280
after this period.

668
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,590
We’re not going to Zhaodu.

669
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,920
You want to stay in Pingting?

670
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,840
Isn’t this ship going to Pingting?

671
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,230
Don’t you know

672
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,590
Zhu Xi, Marquis Pingjiang,
controls Pingting?

673
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,150
Those after Linglong

674
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,760
all came from Pingting.

675
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,480
Pingting

676
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,440
is the capital of Pingjiang.

677
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,920
Then...

678
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,920
Then...

679
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,400
Then... Then...

680
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,230
Then

681
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,030
will you choose me or him?

682
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,110
You...

683
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,550
You came back to this question again!

684
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,000
No, I...

685
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,630
Brat,

686
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,000
why are you blushing?

687
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
What’s it got to do with you?

688
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,110
Am I blushing?

689
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,710
Huotu Xin!

690
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,150
How can you call me that?

691
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,670
Behave!

692
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,440
Come at me if you’re angry!

693
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,070
-Come at you, you dirty brat?
-Stop quarreling!

694
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,960
You even carry a weapon!

695
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,630
What do you want?

696
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,190
Give it to me!

697
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,230
Don’t be so impulsive!

698
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,230
Let go!

699
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,360
-Don’t be so impulsive!
-Shh!

700
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:19,880
Lower your voice!

701
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,360
As stowaways,

702
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,840
shouldn’t you keep it quiet?

703
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,840
Who are you?

704
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,800
Do you know how they

705
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
treat stowaways?

706
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,590
They’ll throw them out.

707
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,550
I knew someone snuck in.

708
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,110
I didn’t expect

709
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,880
you brought two kids with you.

710
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,030
You’re so reckless.

711
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,590
You’ll get them killed.

712
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,110
Keep quiet!

713
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,800
I’ll kill you

714
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,360
if you tell anyone

715
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,510
we’re here.

716
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,880
Didn’t

717
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,280
my brother save you just now?

718
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,550
Don’t you remember?

719
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,320
He asked them to search the ship!

720
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,440
I heard that.

721
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,480
Where are those people then?

722
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,710
They...

723
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,510
They...

724
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,840
Father,

725
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,230
is it appropriate to point your sword

726
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,550
at a girl like this?

727
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,280
Oh yeah?

728
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,480
My name is Huotu Linglong.

729
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,190
This is my father Huotu Xin.

730
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,000
We’re from the Fire Tribe.

731
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,230
I apologize to you for my father.

732
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,150
You don’t need to be afraid of him.

733
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,840
He likes to bluff,

734
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,840
especially before beautiful girls.

735
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,440
Don’t talk nonsense.

736
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,760
My name is Yin Zhuang.

737
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,000
Sis Yin Zhuang?

738
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,710
What are you doing?

739
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,000
I’m warning you,

740
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,840
don’t come close.

741
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,400
Your hairstyle is pretty.

742
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,480
Who did it for you?

743
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,360
What is it?

744
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,110
I don’t know how to say it.

745
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,800
You better come and see for yourself.

746
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,510
You must keep your words.

747
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,110
I’ll do a hairstyle for you,

748
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,110
and you’ll keep us safe.

749
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,440
Did he

750
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,150
do hairstyles for you all the time?

751
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,070
My mother passed away early.

752
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,760
My father did it for me.

753
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:20,710
Does it look good?

754
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,360
Does it look good?

755
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,670
Very good.

756
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,800
Very good.

757
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,440
If we

758
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,550
have a daughter in the future,

759
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,670
we’ll wear the same hairstyle.

760
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,230
What is it?

761
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,480
Doesn’t it look good?

762
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:49,760
Very good.

763
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,960
Very good.

764
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,000
Crap!

765
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,110
What?
