<i>Episode 8</i>

24
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,030
Oh, my God.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,680
If you want this,

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,150
I can ask others to get it.

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,960
Why should we make so much ado?

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
I don’t want others to know

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,630
it’s us who get this.

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
Why is this so heavy?

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,400
It’s lucky we are not caught.

32
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,590
If anyone discovers

33
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,680
I pretend to be a guard,

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,030
they may think I am absurd.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,030
Do you know

36
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,280
how the children in our tribe

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,080
speak of me?

38
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,190
They said,

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,150
even pigs team up with me,

40
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,710
and enter the Flame Chilling Wall,

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,430
they won’t lose a single hair.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,590
Do you know what pigs are?

43
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,750
Yes.

44
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,190
I... I don’t mean that.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,750
Look, the pigs

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,560
can do nothing.

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
But I have another thing.

48
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,560
I need your help.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,520
What will you do again?

50
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,240
It’s not difficult, nor dangerous.

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,750
I’m the Emperor of Suchuan.

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,520
A man should be prudent and dignified,

53
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,960
act magnanimously,

54
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,080
and keep his words.

55
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,520
I will never do

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
what I did today.

57
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,630
Come down.

58
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,190
What I ask you to do now

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
is absolutely magnanimous.

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,400
Say it.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,360
Lure Fei Tian away for me.

62
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,280
I want to enter her room.

63
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,360
Linglong.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,520
Do you have any misunderstandings to

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,120
the word “magnanimous”?

66
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,710
I...

67
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,710
What are you doing?

68
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,270
You want to play the woman?

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
I am not Huotu Xin.

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,950
Right.

71
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,870
You are not my father.

72
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,680
Only he can see me play the woman.

73
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,600
Anyway,

74
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,510
I won’t do anything sneakily

75
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,630
for you anymore.

76
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,390
It’s not to help me.

77
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,600
It’s to help Master Fozhuan.

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,390
Remember, this is the last time.

79
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,830
I thought after you died,

80
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,680
I can finish your wish for you.

81
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
I never expected

82
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,680
the old man would aim at me.

83
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,830
It’s fine.

84
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,950
We can’t stay together when we’re alive.

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,070
But

86
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,040
we can be buried together after death.

87
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,430
I don’t believe in your God.

88
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,720
So I have to leave you

89
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,630
in the cave at Moon Tribe.

90
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,070
If you can speak now,

91
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,830
you must argue with me.

92
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,190
When you were alive,

93
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
I abandoned you.

94
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,240
But I keep you after you died.

95
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,310
Will you blame me?

96
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,360
Fozhuan.

97
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,830
Yuan Yi,

98
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,800
I must make Master Fozhuan

99
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,190
bury in the Tianqi Cemetery.

100
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,630
Fei Tian.

101
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,430
Come in, Your Majesty.

102
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,630
Your Majesty.

103
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,310
Come with me.

104
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,510
I have something to discuss with you.

105
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,270
Your Majesty,

106
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,430
if it’s about the Ritual of Eternity,

107
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,680
I

108
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,670
will never agree with it.

109
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,030
I want to discuss

110
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,910
the matter about Marquis Pingjiang.

111
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,790
Master Fozhuan,

112
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,030
you can rest assured.

113
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,440
I will protect

114
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,030
your beloved Fei Tian for you.

115
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,080
You’re dead,

116
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,720
but I still need your help.

117
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,870
I’m so sorry.

118
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,320
Jia.

119
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Slow down.

120
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,200
Drink slowly.

121
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,670
Jia.

122
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,910
How will you take me out?

123
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,390
Get into its belly.

124
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,600
You

125
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,600
must ask Goddess

126
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,480
to cure my daughter.

127
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,510
Fine.

128
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,870
I am Jia,

129
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,600
living beside the stone monkey,

130
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,670
outside the third gate tower
in southern city

131
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,360
The house with a red door

132
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,270
is my home.

133
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,080
Do you remember?

134
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,200
Yes.

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,240
You’re lucky.

136
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,750
The Marquis didn’t remember you

137
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,720
for a whole day.

138
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,150
I’ll go have a check.

139
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
Get in it quickly.

140
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,000
Fine.

141
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:20,870
J...

142
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,790
This is what hope brings.

143
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,960
Even you don’t know whether it’s true,

144
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,670
you will still fight for it
with your life.

145
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,790
A man believes your daughter’s story.

146
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,630
He dares to rescue my prisoner.

147
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,870
If one thousand persons believe it,

148
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,720
they will break my city gate,

149
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,030
and occupy my city.

150
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,790
The greater God is,

151
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,510
The more terrible his killer is.

152
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,270
What are you going to do?

153
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,080
Nothing is more shocking

154
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,870
than killing Goddess

155
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,030
at the house of worship.

156
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,670
This useless Jia

157
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,630
nearly got me killed.

158
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,320
Did you count

159
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,320
how many times is it?

160
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,790
Who’s it?

161
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,790
Did you think of me?

162
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,630
It's you!

163
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,550
Why it's you again?

164
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,750
I’ve stayed there for a whole day,

165
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,240
and ate nothing.

166
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,870
How come

167
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,550
you don’t ask a word

168
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,270
about me?

169
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,630
Why are you staying there?

170
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,720
Do you think I like staying in it?

171
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,600
If I were burned to death by Zhu Xi,

172
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,960
can you see me now?

173
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,550
Since you're so poor,

174
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,440
I will

175
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,750
show my mercy on you again.

176
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,080
Thank you.

177
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,720
I never expected you’ll save me again.

178
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,750
What is my name?

179
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,670
My name.

180
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I’ve told you that.

181
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
If you forget,

182
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,600
I will leave now.

183
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,200
Wu...

184
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,790
Wu Yuan

185
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,440
You’re lucky.

186
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:28,630
Done!

187
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,440
Let’s go!

188
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,390
Aren’t you afraid of Zhu Xi?

189
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,600
Yes.

190
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
I’m so afraid that

191
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,870
my hands are trembling.

192
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,750
I’ll try my best to fight out.

193
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,150
Let’s meet at the gate.

194
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,670
Forget it.

195
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,870
You’ve caused Jia’s death.

196
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,360
Don’t implicate me now.

197
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,120
You wait here.

198
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,270
I’ll go clear the way.

199
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,270
Southern city,

200
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,480
outside the third gate tower,

201
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,670
beside the stone monkey,

202
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,270
the house with a red door.

203
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,550
I remember it.

204
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,670
Look at me.

205
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,480
After you see the dead persons’ face,

206
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,550
and look at me again,

207
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
do you think I’m more beautiful?

208
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,360
The...

209
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,510
The...

210
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,480
They are killed by you?

211
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,000
Why?

212
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,600
You can’t bear it?

213
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,510
If so,

214
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,030
how can you live in Pingting?

215
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,550
You killed so many people.

216
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,030
Why there is no blood on your clothes?

217
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,670
I am a girl.

218
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,200
Let’s go now!

219
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,200
If we don’t,

220
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,440
when the next shift comes,

221
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,390
we can’t leave anymore.

222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,510
Alright.

223
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,480
This way.

224
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,510
You run your guts out.

225
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,360
Where are you going?

226
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,480
Leave here far away.

227
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,480
Do you know the way?

228
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,750
When the Earth Fire is out of control,

229
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,350
just run away,

230
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,550
to any direction.

231
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,960
The farther, the better.

232
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,510
Listen.

233
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,160
Do the people in your Fire Tribe

234
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,240
know nothing

235
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,200
unrelated to the Earth Fire?

236
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,720
What do you mean?

237
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,200
We have run around

238
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,240
the prison of Marquis Pingjiang

239
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,510
for eight times.

240
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,200
What?

241
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,070
This is a ring road.

242
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,550
How could it be?

243
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
How could it be?

244
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,920
I used to run

245
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,000
by looking at trees and stones.

246
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,510
Here is no tree or stone.

247
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,920
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

248
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,350
I thought you have your idea.

249
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:45,830
I...

250
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,240
I...

251
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,070
I...

252
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,350
Well...

253
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,200
Well...

254
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,310
Are you really coming to help me?

255
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,480
Yes.

256
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,750
What can I do for you?

257
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,310
Find my daughter.

258
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,640
Fine. Where to find her?

259
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,200
Zhao...

260
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,590
I see.

261
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,240
These are all your tricks.

262
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,440
Just like you did in the Fire Tribe.

263
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,240
It’s the same.

264
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,510
The purpose is...

265
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,310
To ask me to find Linglong,

266
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,590
right?

267
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,030
The cruel torture in brass bull

268
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,030
is just a disguise.

269
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,920
Even Jia didn’t save me,

270
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,510
you will release me.

271
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,920
Look.

272
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,000
Look at you.

273
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,070
Your clothes are so clean,

274
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,510
without any blood.

275
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,240
Because you didn’t kill anyone.

276
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,790
Those people were just

277
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,880
cooperating with you,

278
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,640
right?

279
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,350
Good!

280
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,720
You get it so fast.

281
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,830
Never believe anyone.

282
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,200
This is the only principle

283
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,400
to live in Pingting.

284
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,590
Keep it in mind.

285
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,200
But Zhu Xi should have known

286
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,680
Linglong was going to Zhaodu long ago.

287
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,790
What are you doing?

288
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,350
The letter in your pocket

289
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,400
was copied by Weisheng Yan

290
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
and sent to Zhu Xi long ago.

291
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,270
But

292
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,270
it seems Linglong doesn’t want

293
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,350
you to find her in Zhaodu.

294
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,510
She hopes you to stay at Pingting

295
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,790
and find a girl named Jin’er.

296
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,110
Who’s Jin’er?

297
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,720
Linglong’s mother?

298
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,680
None of your business.

299
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,880
This is Pingting.

300
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,000
You can’t hide any secrets.

301
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Well... Then…

302
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,160
What... What do you want to do?

303
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,270
Why did you save me once and again?

304
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,070
Can’t you make it out?

305
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,070
If so,

306
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,920
just follow me.

307
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,880
You’ll know it one day.

308
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,750
You have a lot

309
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,790
to learn in Pingting.

310
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,350
Maybe when I’m happy one day,

311
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,880
I’ll help you find Jin’er.

312
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,160
Fine.

313
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,440
I’ll follow you.

314
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,350
Really?

315
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,110
Take me a pair of shoes first.

316
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,590
The hunters may come soon.

317
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,550
I can’t do it. It hurts!

318
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,350
I can’t walk anymore.

319
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,440
Do you want shoes or life?

320
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,400
Shoes for keeping life.

321
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,790
Alright.

322
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,440
Wait for me here.

323
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,680
Be quick.

324
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,750
I’m waiting here for you.

325
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,960
I can go now.

326
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,480
You fool!

327
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
This is Pingting!

328
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,590
You are alone!

329
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,920
You can’t live here!

330
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,070
I can’t live if I trust you.

331
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,830
This is a letter from my daughter.

332
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,680
How come all of you can read it?

333
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,310
Silly girl.

334
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,270
You’ve grown up.

335
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,790
You’d rather cheat me to Pingting

336
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,510
than taking me to Zhaodu.

337
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,960
Do you think
I can’t protect you anymore?

338
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,110
To be Goddess

339
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,160
is really more important than me?

Chief Priest!

Why are you in such a hurry?

344
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,350
Goddess asked you
to meet her at Tianqi Cemetery.

345
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,590
Tianqi Cemetery?

346
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,510
What to do?

347
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,350
Goddess said,

348
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,160
it’s time to hold a funeral for Fozhuan.

349
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,440
Your Majesty.

350
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,480
Fei Tian,

351
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,640
what do you want to do?

352
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,640
I know as much

353
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,160
as you do.

354
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,310
Goddess.

355
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,400
What does she want to do?

356
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,400
She said,

357
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,480
if she can’t bury Fozhuan

358
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,960
in Tianqi Cemetery,

359
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,240
She’ll make the same platform

360
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
to burn herself.

361
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,550
Goddess,

362
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,070
you can’t do that.

363
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,880
Don’t you want to witness

364
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,000
Goddess’ power?

365
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,440
Fozhuan died for his faith.

366
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,790
He gave his life

367
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,550
to Goddess.

368
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,550
This is

369
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,880
the ceremony Goddess welcomes him.

370
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,240
Fozhuan gave his life

371
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,880
to Goddess.

372
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,640
Immortals will give him

373
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
the equal glory.

374
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,590
Chief Priest.

375
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,680
This is the sign of Goddess.

376
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,480
Now,

377
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,030
can we bury Master Fozhuan

378
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,440
as a God servant in Tianqi Cemetery?

379
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,030
Yes!

380
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,590
Good.

381
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
I agree to hold the Ritual of Eternity.

382
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,720
But

383
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,480
if you can’t prove you're Goddess

384
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,790
at the Ritual of Eternity,

385
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,070
it means you’re a liar,

386
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,000
and you’ll be sentenced to death.

387
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,270
Do you agree?

388
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,720
I agree.

389
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,510
Your aim is perfect!

390
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,270
It’s nothing,

391
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,270
just one of my required skills.

392
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,510
What do you think?

393
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,550
Want to learn?

394
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,590
I can teach you.

395
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,310
Watch carefully.

396
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,510
Like this?

397
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,680
I underrated you.

398
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,720
It’s nothing.

399
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,830
It is just

400
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,160
one of my required skills.

401
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,720
How about

402
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,920
we play a game?

403
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,550
How?

404
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,400
Your turn!

405
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,110
Come on!

406
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,750
Don’t shoot me!

407
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,160
Why don’t you do it by rules?

408
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,070
Rules don’t say I can’t hold it.

409
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,790
Let’s begin!

410
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,640
I’ll see how you shoot.

411
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,480
Would you like me to move closer?

412
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,240
What are you doing?

413
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,350
You break the rules.

414
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,480
Rules don’t say

415
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,960
I can’t move closer.

416
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,350
You are shameless.

417
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,000
You did it first.

418
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,110
Take the apple out.

419
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:45,640
I

420
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,350
will

421
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,880
not!

422
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,790
Take out or not?

423
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,640
I won’t take out!

424
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,440
Alright. I give up.

425
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,790
You mean it?

426
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,590
A bet is a bet.

427
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,960
What do you want?

428
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,270
Well...

429
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,070
I have to think it over.

430
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,960
It’s a promise from

431
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,880
the Emperor of Suchuan.

432
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,270
I’ll use it at critical moment.

433
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,960
Linglong...

434
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,830
Will you abandon me?

435
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,920
Linglong...

436
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,680
Ling...

437
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,960
I’ve slept for so long.

438
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,790
Little girl.

439
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,510
What... What’s wrong?

440
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,030
I... I’m not cold.

441
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,160
I... I’m not cold.

442
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,200
Take it. Take it.

443
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,550
Alright, alright.

444
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,440
Thank you.

445
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,510
By the way,

446
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,680
do

447
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,750
you know the way to Zhaodu?

448
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,480
It doesn’t matter.

449
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,710
This is Pingting.

450
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,880
Sir.

451
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,920
What do you think of this?

452
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
My chicken is big and fat.

453
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,550
Come have a look.

454
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,320
Come help me.

455
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,550
I’m coming.

456
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,800
Excuse me. Excuse me.

457
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,070
Come on, this way.

458
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,230
Don’t run.

459
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,590
Wait for me.

460
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,230
What are you doing?

461
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,150
Are you blind?

462
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,110
Sorry.

463
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,670
Look at this.

464
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,190
These birds

465
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,550
are good.

466
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,190
Idiot!

467
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,960
Idiot!

468
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,550
Idiot!

469
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,630
Be careful.

470
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,550
You nearly break it!

471
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,630
It's you again, little girl.

472
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,280
You

473
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,440
are looking for me?

474
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,280
Well...

475
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,190
Alright.

476
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,150
I should return this to you.

477
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,590
You take it. Take it.

478
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,360
I…

479
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:37,960
Alright.

480
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,590
Alright.

481
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,440
Thank you.

482
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,070
I

483
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,110
have something to do.

484
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
I can’t play with you.

485
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,230
You come back

486
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,630
to your father and mother.

487
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,480
Come on.

488
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,760
Well...

489
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,000
What... What’s wrong?

490
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,280
Little girl.

491
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,440
Where is your family?

492
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,400
Did you get lost?

493
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,630
Where is your father?

494
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,230
Died.

495
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,840
Well... Where is your mother?

496
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,280
You...

497
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,070
Don’t cry.

498
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:25,960
Don’t...

499
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,630
Don’t cry. Don’t cry.

500
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,670
Alright, alright.

501
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,400
Don’t cry. Don’t cry.

502
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,110
Come on.

503
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,760
I’ll give you a twirl.

504
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,000
It’s alright.

505
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,590
Stop crying.

506
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,150
My daughter Linglong

507
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,070
is like you in her childhood.

508
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,800
When she’s crying,

509
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,800
I’d pick her up and hold her high,

510
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,880
and she’ll be fine after a twirl.

511
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,510
Am I right?

512
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,000
Well...

513
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,360
Little girl.

514
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,070
Do you know the way to your home?

515
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,280
What should I do then?

516
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,400
Bun!

517
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,920
Steaming hot buns!

518
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,400
Wear it. Wear it.

519
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,760
I’m not cold.

520
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,630
Wear it.

521
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:14,920
Here.

522
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,030
Done.

523
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,150
Where are we going?

524
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,190
You are hungry, aren’t you?

525
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,510
I haven’t eaten anything for two days.

526
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,590
Here, sir.

527
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,480
Your buns!

528
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,320
Thank you.

529
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,880
Wait for a moment.

530
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,710
Boss.

531
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,360
Sir.

532
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,440
What do you want?

533
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,190
Your buns

534
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,150
are bought with money, right?

535
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,710
You must be joking.

536
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,760
At my stall,

537
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,510
five coins can buy

538
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,440
two meat buns

539
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,510
or six vegetable buns.

540
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,190
See?

541
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,880
What do you want?

542
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,440
I

543
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,280
don’t have money.

544
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,480
But

545
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,670
here.

546
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,230
What do you mean?

547
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,670
Give me ten buns.

548
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,630
Take this blood stone as proof.

549
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,710
According to the rule of our Fire Tribe,

550
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,760
I will return ten buns

551
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,000
within ten days

552
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,150
and take back my blood stone.

553
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,320
Let’s go.

554
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,510
Let’s go.

555
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,030
I know

556
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,960
ten buns don’t worth

557
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,760
my blood stone,

558
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,150
but

559
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,630
it's a special situation.

560
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,360
I have no other idea.

561
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,670
It's done!

562
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,230
Go!

563
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,440
You beggar!

564
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,630
You fool!

565
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,920
Don’t beat him! Don’t!

566
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,440
Go!

567
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,190
You can refuse the deal.

568
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,550
Why you beat her?

569
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,400
You bastard!

570
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,440
Don’t beat me!

571
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,510
You even beat a kid. Are you a man?

572
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,670
You bastard!

573
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,920
You beat a kid!

574
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,670
Your food

575
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,230
doesn’t match my blood stone.

576
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,880
We won’t eat it.

577
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,590
Let’s go.

578
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,760
In the future,

579
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,960
don’t eat anything

580
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,150
