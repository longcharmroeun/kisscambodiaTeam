24
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,280
Master.

25
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,400
It smells so good.

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,310
Thank you.

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,190
It’s okay.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,710
Xiao.

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,150
It’s really delicious.

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,910
Linglong.

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,150
You didn’t lie to me.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,190
It’s really good.

33
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,470
Father.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,470
Mother was like

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,310
Yin Zhuang, right?

36
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,030
What?

37
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,030
If her brother hears this,

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,870
he’ll freak out again.

39
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,240
Father.

40
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,630
You didn’t like anyone

41
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,520
in the tribe,

42
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,310
and you couldn’t do that.

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,310
But now you’re out,

44
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,560
have you ever thought of

45
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,360
finding me a mother?

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,120
You...

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
What about your mother?

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
I’m sure she would wish us happiness.

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,710
I think

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,360
you should think about it.

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,630
She’s going to get married.

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,400
What?!

53
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,680
Did you get it wrong?

54
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,830
Intentional, I said.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,630
Well...

56
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,160
The ship owner was intentional.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,040
I didn’t mention Yin Zhuang.

58
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,390
Why are you nervous?

59
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,160
Leave me alone.

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,870
Yin Zhuang.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,160
You really go to Pingting
to get married?

62
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,950
Yes.

63
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,600
My future husband

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,430
is waiting for me in Pingting.

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,560
Have you

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,750
seen him?

67
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,920
Do you like him?

68
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,510
No.

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,510
Then why do you want to marry him?

70
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,600
Because

71
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,800
he is the richest man

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,750
in Suchuan.

73
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,920
Rich...

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,270
Then you’ll marry him?

75
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,720
What’s the money for?

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,750
You’ll see

77
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,430
when you’re out.

78
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Money can

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,240
do a lot of good.

80
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,510
Don’t worry.

81
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,800
I’m here.

82
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,160
You don’t need money.

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,160
Guy.

84
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,480
I told you.

85
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,600
We’re

86
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,630
not going to Zhaodu.

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,510
Father.

88
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,600
No one mentioned this.

89
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,070
I’m afraid of his bad memory.

90
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,720
So tell me.

91
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,600
If we don’t go to Zhaodu,

92
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,510
where should we go?

93
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,920
Suchuan is so big.

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,480
There are so many places to go.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,870
Linglong will return to Zhaodu with me.

96
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,430
No.

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,160
I’m afraid of death.

98
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,560
She must go with me.

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
Just stop that.

100
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,360
Come on, sit down.

101
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,480
After this meal,

102
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,190
we can go wherever we want.

103
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,630
Merry meet, merry part.

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,830
As a man,

105
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,070
how can you only care
about your own safety?

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,190
Is it wrong for me

107
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,040
to fear death?

108
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,750
Who will take care of my daughter
if I’m gone?

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,070
You’re right.

110
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,070
We all know that.

111
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,920
But please stop fighting

112
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,190
and just eat.

113
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,160
She must

114
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
go with me.

115
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,800
She is my daughter.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
It’s not up to you.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,360
Xiao.

118
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,510
Huotu Xin.

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,750
Your soup is really delicious.

120
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,240
I want to have another bowl,

121
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,240
okay?

122
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,240
Your Majesty.

123
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,750
Don’t worry.

124
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,560
What’s the difference

125
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,560
between you and

126
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,430
those who come to grab her?

127
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,920
You’ll scare them.

128
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,950
It’s no use arguing.

129
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,750
I still have to decide

130
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,120
my own business.

131
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,430
Linglong.

132
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,390
Don’t worry, Father.

133
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,000
No matter what,

134
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,160
you are the most important.

135
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,950
You’re my top priority.

136
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,870
Linglong.

137
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,390
You told me...

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,510
Just stop.

139
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,390
I can’t see my father get hurt anymore.

140
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,160
Yeah, that’s

141
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
what a daughter should say.

142
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,870
The rabbit is okay.

143
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,360
Delicacy

144
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,390
must be cherished.

145
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,630
God gave it to us.

146
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,360
We can discuss everything

147
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
after the meal,

148
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,240
right?

149
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:44,750
Try it.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,390
No.

151
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,510
Have a bite.

152
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:50,680
Try it.

153
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,680
-Here it is, Father.
-Here it is.

154
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,750
-The master baked it.
-Eat more.

155
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,750
After all these work,

156
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,560
you’re not full, right?

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,190
Only when you are full

158
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,000
can you protect Linglong,

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,360
right?

160
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
Thank you, Master.

161
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,270
Your Majesty.

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,270
No.

163
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,680
I’ll eat the rest.

164
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,190
Try it.

165
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,680
It’s delicious.

166
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,680
If you are sleepy, go to sleep.

167
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
I’ll be watching.

168
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,190
I’m not sleepy.

169
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
I have to watch my daughter.

170
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,360
As the saying goes,

171
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,630
the concern of the thief is even worse.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,550
Right?

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,670
You’re awake?

174
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,870
Master.

175
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
You said to look at me,

176
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,790
but you slept deeper than me.

177
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,600
Yin Xiao.

178
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,390
Have you been here all night?

179
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,390
We can’t let up.

180
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,240
Yes.

181
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,240
Sleep in the wild
for the first time, right?

182
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
I never thought that

183
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,550
I could fall asleep out of my bed.

184
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,080
Yin Zhuang also slept so soundly.

185
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,390
She’s nothing like a squeamish girl.

186
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,080
Her suffering

187
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,270
doesn’t show on her face.

188
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,440
Is that why

189
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,670
she wants to marry the rich guy?

190
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,630
You’re too young.

191
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,270
You don’t understand.

192
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,790
I want to see the Evil.

193
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,870
I’ll take you there.

194
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,240
Master.

195
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
What’s on the other side?

196
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,390
It’s the guard ring,

197
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,630
the barrier guarding Zhaodu.

198
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,150
So what’s down here?

199
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,480
Maybe

200
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,510
only Evil Soul

201
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,630
knows that.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,030
Master Fozhuan.

203
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,510
What’s

204
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,670
Goddess?

205
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,670
The Goddess

206
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
is the guardian sent by the Immortals

207
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,670
to Suchuan.

208
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,080
What’s

209
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,670
her power?

210
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,840
Can she put out the Earth Fire?

211
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,440
So

212
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,240
why does Suchuan need Goddess?

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,670
Even if you could put out
the Earth Fire,

214
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
of all the sufferings in this world,

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,910
could only one Goddess save them?

216
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,670
So the power of the Goddess

217
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,750
is not important.

218
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,870
Yesterday,

219
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,670
you saw me rise from the dead

220
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,670
and scatter enemies with Fire, right?

221
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,200
What do you feel?

222
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,510
I...

223
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,720
Hope.

224
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,390
Because I think

225
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
you can save my father.

226
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,120
Yeah.

227
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,870
At that time,

228
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,150
you didn’t know where your father was,

229
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,910
whether he was alive

230
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,790
or dead.

231
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,870
But

232
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,910
you’ll keep looking for him.

233
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,790
Because you believe in a power

234
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,870
and see hope.

235
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,910
Hope

236
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,390
is the power of Goddess.

237
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,630
I think

238
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,080
I got it.

239
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,480
Oh.

240
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,720
Come here.

241
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,000
I’ll tell you a secret.

242
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,550
You know what.

243
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,510
It’s all a lie.

244
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,420
Shh.

245
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,670
Keep your voice down.

246
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,840
Look.

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,390
The knife

248
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,000
goes in here

249
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,480
and out here.

250
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,200
I had already

251
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,390
shrunk down to this side.

252
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,630
The blood is fake.

253
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,320
Well...

254
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,000
Then...

255
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
What about the Fire?

256
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,390
I secretly sprinkled

257
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,150
fire powder on him.

258
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,960
Only

259
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,000
a little spark...

260
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,120
So

261
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,440
you can’t spell at all.

262
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,550
I’m an ordinary person,

263
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,960
so there are no spells.

264
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,550
But if you believe it,

265
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,240
it’s true.

266
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,600
Over the years,

267
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,600
with these little tricks,

268
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,720
I’ve really saved

269
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,960
a lot of lost people.

270
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,550
Oh, yeah,

271
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,080
and this.

272
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Look at it.

273
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,150
Yuan Yi’s Star Map.

274
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,750
You...

275
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,030
Look at this.

276
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,440
What you saw before

277
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,030
was all the phantom it projected.

278
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,200
It’s made by

279
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,790
the descendants of Li,

280
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,270
the only one in Suchuan.

281
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,120
Even Yuan Yi was cheated by you.

282
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,200
His Majesty can do it.

283
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
But only on the Calculator,

284
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,840
that’s the real miracle.

285
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,150
Master.

286
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,720
You got kicked out of

287
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,870
Tianqi Sect

288
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,480
because of these heresy?

289
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,870
How can you believe these rumors?

290
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,600
I...

291
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
I really left on my own will.

292
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,080
And,

293
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,000
Fei Tian and I

294
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,270
are in love.

295
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,630
I think

296
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,480
I understand your words.

297
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,840
You are a smart girl.

298
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,510
Oh, and

299
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,200
I’ll keep the secret.

300
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,480
You learned so fast.

301
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,030
Remember.

302
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,080
Mystery

303
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,360
is the first rule of

304
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,600
being a Goddess.

305
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:02,960
Linglong.

306
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,320
Is my father awake?

307
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
Yuan Yi and my brother went
to find Linglong.

308
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,320
Aren’t you worried?

309
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,870
What to worry about?

310
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,030
Didn’t you hear her words?

311
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,790
I’m her

312
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,200
first priority.

313
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,030
And I tell you.

314
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,790
Linglong,

315
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,080
whatever she decides,

316
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,080
no one could change it.

317
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,870
Aren’t you afraid
she’ll change her mind?

318
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,360
I tell you.

319
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,200
Kid.

320
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,320
You can’t force her,

321
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,840
the more you force her,

322
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,910
the more she’ll turn against you.

323
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,150
So,

324
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,630
you need to give her some space.

325
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,960
Oh, you know how to raise a kid.

326
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,510
When you have kids,

327
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,440
you’ll understand.

328
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,750
I want to

329
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,630
have a daughter

330
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,030
like Linglong.

331
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,670
Have you considered it?

332
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,910
I’ve been thinking your words.

333
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,790
As a Goddess,

334
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,510
I have no choice,

335
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,080
but I can’t let my father
get hurt again.

336
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,080
Linglong.

337
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,360
I’m here.

338
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,080
You’ll be safe.

339
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,790
I mean,

340
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,390
I’m leaving my father.

341
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,910
As long as he’s with me,

342
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,150
he’s in danger.

343
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,790
Only on the way to Zhaodu,

344
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,750
there are so many blockers.

345
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,030
In Zhaodu,

346
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,910
it’ll be more dangerous.

347
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,270
I’ll go to Zhaodu with you,

348
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,120
but my father

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,510
can’t go.

350
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,320
Yin Xiao.

351
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,150
Can you grant me a request?

352
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,120
Before I truly become the Goddess,

353
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,120
please protect my father

354
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,200
and don’t let him get hurt.

355
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,270
Okay.

356
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
What’s your plan?

357
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,120
I...

358
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,200
I have an idea.

359
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,550
How dare he come here!

360
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,680
Don’t worry.

361
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,030
He can help us.

362
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,790
How long have they been there?

363
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,880
Why haven’t they come back?

364
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
The radishes are all boiled to a pulp.

365
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,720
They’ll be back soon.

366
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,200
It’s not far from here.

367
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,550
Again?

368
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,350
Yin Zhuang.

369
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,480
Wait here for me.

370
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,350
I’ll go find them.

371
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,240
I’ll go with you.

372
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,030
Father.

373
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,110
Father.

374
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,270
Get up here.

375
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,640
The trackers are here again.

376
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,160
How did you get up there?

377
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,270
Don’t get on their boat.

378
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,110
If you don’t come up, it’s too late.

379
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,510
The trackers are over there.

380
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,440
Right?

381
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:56,750
Well...

382
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,830
Get up here.

383
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,070
We’ll talk about it up here.

384
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,550
Get up first.

385
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,400
OK, let’s go.

386
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,000
Where is Linglong?

387
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,030
Don’t worry.

388
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,480
They’re safe.

389
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,440
Come with me.

390
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,030
Hurry up.

391
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,160
Wait a moment.

392
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,830
I’ll go get them.

393
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,070
I’m sorry.

394
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,350
Father.

395
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,960
He’ll be furious.

396
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,200
With Yin Xiao there,

397
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,350
he’ll be fine.

398
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,000
You left him a letter.

399
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,750
Your father will understand you.

400
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,310
When you see him again,

401
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,350
he’ll know

402
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,070
you are right.

403
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,880
Yes,

404
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,440
definitely.

405
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,200
I worked hard

406
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,720
to get her here,

407
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,310
and you let her go?

408
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,880
She’ll be much helpful in Zhaodu

409
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,510
than in Pingting.

410
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,240
What’s your plan?

411
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,240
Weisheng Yan.

412
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,880
As the richest man in Suchuan,

413
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,510
why don’t you spend more money

414
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,830
to buy a good smoke?

415
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,750
As a girl,

416
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,310
why don’t you bring a handkerchief?

417
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,510
She’s your bride?

418
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,030
Beautiful?

419
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,110
But her brother is fierce.

420
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,030
Yeah.

421
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,680
If her brother knows that

422
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,790
you are Weisheng Yan,

423
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,750
happy event will also become a funeral.

424
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,110
Since he would marry his sister to me,

425
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,830
he would never ruin his career

426
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,270
over such a trifle.

427
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,640
He is now in favor of His Majesty,

428
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,790
will he care about you?

429
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,720
Yin and Yuan teamed up again.

430
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,440
Even you didn’t expect it, right?

431
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,000
Or,

432
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,720
when I followed him,

433
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,510
you knew he was His Majesty?

434
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,960
I don’t know everything.

435
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,880
Remember?

436
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,480
This time, even I

437
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,880
almost got killed.

438
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,830
Now that you’ve let her go,

439
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,440
what about what you promised me?

440
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,070
She’s no use to you now.

441
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,750
Only if she’s recognized by Zhaodu

442
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,550
can she be valuable.

443
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,240
How do I explain to Zhu Xi
when I go back?

444
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,750
Her father is here.

445
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
This Fire Tribe man

446
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,160
is your answer to Marquis Pingjiang.

448

Linglong.

449
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,830
Are you okay?

450
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,400
I don’t know if

451
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,640
my father’s used to

452
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,400
Pingting’s food.

453
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,110
If you regret it,

454
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,590
I’ll send someone to take him to Zhaodu.

455
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,640
No.

456
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,030
Thank you.

457
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,000
When you go through a real separation,

458
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,680
you’ll grow up.

459
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,750
And then,

460
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,110
you’ll find that

461
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,030
all the gatherings and separations

462
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,750
are wonderful.

463
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,830
Fei Tian is coming soon.

464
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,270
Master, are you nervous?

465
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,480
Why me?

466
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,160
Ah.

467
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,480
I never

468
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,680
thought of seeing her again.

469
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,030
Has she told you about me?

470
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
I only heard your name

471
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,200
mentioned by the Chief Priest

472
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,310
when he was teaching the little ones.

473
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,480
He still remembers me.

474
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Tell me

475
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,030
your story.

476
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,270
My story

477
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,720
is very old-fashioned.

478
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,790
We

479
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,510
fought and fought

480
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
and finally fell in love.

481
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,440
For her,

482
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,200
I almost

483
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,920
broke

484
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,550
all the rules.

485
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,110
Although Fei Tian

486
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,750
is a woman,

487
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,440
she has great ambitions.

488
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,200
At that time, she had just

489
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,440
found her footing in the court.

490
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,720
Tianqi couldn’t tolerate

491
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,000
her Moon Tribe growing stronger.

492
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,000
My relationship with her

493
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,110
has become more of an obstacle.

494
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,830
Later, I realized that

495
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,160
only by leaving her

496
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,110
can I make her.

497
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,030
And then?

498
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,400
And here we are.

499
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,070
Over the past ten years,

500
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,880
I’ve been traveling in Suchuan

501
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,880
and preaching.

502
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,110
She

503
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,640
became the first Moon Prime Minister

504
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,750
of Suchuan.

505
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,160
No wonder Fei Tian

506
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,030
has never considered

507
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,750
marriage.

508
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,920
I thought she was all about politics.

509
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,160
Fozhuan.

510
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,830
I’ll preside over your marriage

511
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,270
back to Zhaodu.

512
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,270
After so many years,

513
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,480
I don’t expect this.

514
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,590
Have you never thought about

515
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,680
marrying her?

516
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,030
As long as

517
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,680
I can

518
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,440
see her wings one more time,

519
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,550
falling from the sky

520
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,790
to my side,

521
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,590
I’ll be satisfied.

522
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,550
Run.

523
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,720
Run!

524
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,920
Master Fozhuan.

525
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,400
Master Fozhuan.

526
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,960
Fozhuan.

527
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,680
You...

528
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,790
You’re lying again?!

529
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,070
Master, you know spells, right?

530
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:19,880
Stand up.

531
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,030
Master.

532
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,400
Go.

533
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,790
What about your spells?

534
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,160
Stand up quickly.

535
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,440
I can.

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,720
I can.

537
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,270
I can.

538
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,720
Fozhuan said...

539
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,030
How can you play tricks?

540
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,790
Kill the man.

541
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,270
Take the woman.

542
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,480
Stop.

543
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,510
Fei Tian.

544
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
Fei Tian.

545
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,000
Seeing His Majesty,

546
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,000
kneel down.

547
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,270
His Majesty.

548
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,000
Your Majesty.

549
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,110
It’s you again.

550
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,200
What are you doing?

551
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,510
Where is Linglong?

552
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,590
She has gone.

553
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,200
Gone?

554
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:23,750
You...

555
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,160
You...

556
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,480
You...

557
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,440
Where did you get her?

558
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,640
Don’t be angry

559
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,680
and allow me to make something clear.

560
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,830
Your daughter left

561
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,920
on her own will.

562
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,070
And,

563
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,830
she begged me to do her a favor.

564
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,030
Look.

565
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,750
Fire Tribe script.

566
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,160
Linglong’s handwriting.

567
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,920
I can’t imitate this, right?

568
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:51,880
Oh, by the way,

569
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,510
the Yin siblings did their part.

570
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,790
Is that clear?

571
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,480
A show

572
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,640
of solidarity with you,

573
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,310
it must be hard for them.

574
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,510
Linglong.

575
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,440
Daughters are all like this.

576
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,000
Go out.

577
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,920
Get married.

578
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,590
They’ll leave their parents
sooner or later.

579
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,350
Let it go.

580
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,270
Where is Yin Xiao?

581
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,030
Get him over here.

582
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,400
He’s not awake yet.

583
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,240
I can’t believe

584
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
you guys

585
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,440
are stronger.

586
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,960
OK.

587
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,720
I believe you.

588
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,960
You

589
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,720
untie me first.

590
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,000
I can’t do that.

591
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,160
You’d better put the letter away,

592
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,790
in case Marquis Pingjiang gets it.

593
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,480
What do you mean?

594
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,680
We’re almost at Pingting.

595
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,550
What are you doing?

596
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,440
I warn you.

597
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,830
I know who you are.

598
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,110
Weisheng Yan.

599
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:56,920
You...

600
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,200
I’m not scaring you.

601
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,350
If you do anything to me,

602
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,270
I tell you,

603
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,550
you’ll come to a bad end.

604
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,000
Believe it or not.

605
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,000
I tell you,

606
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,480
I’m not scaring you.

607
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,200
How do you tell?

608
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,550
I know now.

609
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,920
Then I can’t tolerate you.

610
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,270
Are you awake?

611
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,640
Where are we?

612
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,590
It seems

613
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,000
we’ve arrived.

614
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,400
-Here is...
-Shh...

615
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,160
You’re awake.

616
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,680
You’ve been waiting at the door?

617
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,440
Yes.

618
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,110
I don’t dare to bother you.

619
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,270
Why stun us?

620
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,550
I’m really sorry.

621
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,270
I’m afraid that the Fire Tribe man

622
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,110
learned that his daughter had left him

623
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,110
and gone to Zhaodu,

624
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,590
he would make trouble on the boat.

625
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,550
In order to avoid

626
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,920
collateral damage to you,

627
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,720
I made this move.

628
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Linglong has gone to Zhaodu?

629
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,680
As a servant,

630
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,640
you’re too bold.

631
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,510
That’s why

632
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,680
I’m fighting for my life.

633
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,510
You

634
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,160
hated me so badly,

635
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,200
and were forced to board the ship.

636
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,200
I’m afraid that

637
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,240
if something happened on the way,

638
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,350
I can’t safely bring you to Pingting

639
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,680
to meet my host.

640
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,400
Excuse me.

641
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,000
Is this the home of Weisheng Yan?

642
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:49,720
Yes.

643
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,200
My host has been detained on the road.

644
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,880
Please forgive.

645
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,070
Where is Huotu Xin?

646
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,400
He’s in the guest room.

647
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,640
Don’t worry.

648
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,640
Take me to see him.

649
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,400
Okay.

650
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,030
Follow me.

651
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,550
I’ll be back soon.

652
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,070
Take care of Miss Yin Zhuang.

653
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,200
-Yes.
-Yes.

654
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,880
Please.

655
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,640
Please.

656
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,350
Right here.

657
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:10,960
Where’s he?

658
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,400
Help.

659
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,280
Help.

660
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,110
Help.

661
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,110
Help me.

662
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,880
Lord.

663
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,070
Marquis is waiting for you.

664
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,670
Help.

665
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,960
What happened?

666
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,630
Where’s he?

667
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,400
I...

668
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,230
I don’t know.

669
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:40,840
Well...

670
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,550
He was just screaming for food.

671
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,070
Damn.

672
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,510
Go find him.

673
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,000
Yes.

674
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,880
I’m really sorry.

675
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,360
I didn’t know he was in such a hurry.

676
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,510
What for?

677
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,550
I gave him Linglong’s letter.

678
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,110
This Fire Tribe man

679
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,070
is very brutal,

680
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,000
not as good as you.

681
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,070
You saw what he did to me.

682
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,110
I can’t bear the guilt of

683
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,710
stealing his daughter.

684
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,360
But don’t worry.

685
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,030
As long as he’s in Pingting,

686
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,480
my host would

687
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,590
find him.

688
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,880
We’ll get him back sooner or later.

689
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,590
Of course you can find him.

690
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,710
It’s your place,

691
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,550
right,

692
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,800
Weisheng Yan?

693
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,920
I dare not deceive you.

694
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,110
You condescend

695
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,510
along the way,

696
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,920
pretending to be the ship owner,

697
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,550
pretending to be humble,

698
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,840
for what?

699
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,280
You’re joking.

700
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,840
Even if I don’t pretend,

701
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,150
you’re still honorable.

702
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,920
I’m still humble.

703
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,590
To observe us.

704
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,230
You’re so wise.

705
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,360
What’s your conclusion?

706
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,230
Yin Zhuang is worth marrying,

707
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,400
and Yin Xiao

708
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,550
is worthy of support.

709
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,920
Do you think

710
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I’ll marry my sister

711
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,480
to you?

712
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,760
Please come with me.

713
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,440
Please see.

714
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,960
That’s

715
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,000
our vault,

716
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,150
and this key

717
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,320
is the only way into it.

718
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,280
Then you have to put it away.

719
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,510
Even a man

720
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,070
can disappear in your house,

721
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,510
let alone

722
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,150
the little key.

723
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,590
You’re joking.

724
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,000
Even if an outsider gets this key,

725
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,920
it is useless.

726
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,070
Because the lock of the vault

727
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,480
is bound to my blood,

728
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,280
and cannot be opened

729
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,000
by the key alone.

730
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,320
And I’m

731
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,150
the only Weisheng

732
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,190
in this world.

733
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,320
So,

734
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,630
my child will be

735
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,110
the second person in this world

736
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,760
who can use this key.

737
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,960
Weisheng Yan.

738
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,480
Your most precious thing

739
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,280
is hanging on the mountain,

740
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,190
and mine

741
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,630
should be living in freedom.

742
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,150
You trade it for Yin Zhuang,

743
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,400
then you’re underestimating her.

744
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,480
In three days,

745
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,360
bring Huotu Xin here.

746
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,320
I’ll take her out of Pingting.

747
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,510
Live in freedom?

748
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,670
That’s what Yin Zhuang wants?

749
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,070
What’s that golden thing?

750
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,920
Miss.

751
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,320
That’s host’s vault.

752
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,400
Vault?

753
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,920
Yes.

754
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,150
Weisheng Yan...

755
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,110
Yin Zhuang’s expectation

756
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,630
of marrying Weisheng Yan,

757
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,150
as the ship owner,

758
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,840
is clear to me.

759
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,590
Is she expecting me?

760
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,360
Of course not.

761
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,440
She hasn’t even seen me.

762
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,480
So,

763
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,030
what does she want?

764
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,590
If you insult Yin Zhuang one more time,

765
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,000
I’ll cut your tongue.

766
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,400
Our marriage

767
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,280
was appointed by your father
before he died.

768
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,550
As her brother,

769
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,000
in spite of your father’s will,

770
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,630
you ruined the life she desires

771
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,480
just for your own selfishness.

772
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,630
Who insults Yin Zhuang?

773
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,760
Have you ever wondered

774
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,150
what is her happiness?

775
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,800
Yin Xiao’s sister for a lifetime?

776
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,000
Mrs. Weisheng?

777
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,320
Or

778
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,190
both?

779
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,280
I’ll treat her well.

780
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,670
Weisheng Yan.

781
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,920
Why do you want to marry her?

782
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,110
To

783
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,710
keep it for my child.

784
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,630
I built the vault there,

785
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,110
holding the only key

786
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,550
in my hand.

787
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,670
You think it’s foolproof?

788
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,030
Of course not.

789
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,800
If Marquis Pingjiang

790
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
wants what’s inside,

791
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,760
he doesn’t need the key.

792
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,150
You’re right.

793
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,230
No matter how much money

794
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,400
I hide in there,

795
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,510
it’s not on me.

796
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,110
I’m always

797
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,150
a humble civilian.

798
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,710
The only reason I still own it

799
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,550
is because

800
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,440
he needs me

801
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,400
to generate more money for him

802
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,000
until I’m not useful

803
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,360
anymore.

804
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,070
When that day comes,

805
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,110
I’m afraid my blood

806
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,400
will be mixed

807
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,000
in the roadside mud.

808
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,710
So

809
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,030
I need your surname.

810
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,230
My fortune

811
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,110
can help the Yins

812
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,670
return to the top of Suchuan.

813
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,320
In this world,

814
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,710
the strongest bond

815
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,630
is mutual need.

816
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,030
Her child

817
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,000
will have the most wealth

818
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,800
in Suchuan.

819
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,150
At that time,

820
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,440
only you can protect him.

821
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,150
But what you said,

822
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,510
I don’t care at all.

823
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,030
Yin Zhuang.

824
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,880
Mr. Yin.

825
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,670
This way, please.

826
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:04,920
Yin Zhuang.

827
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,710
Yin Zhuang.

828
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:13,480
Xiao.

829
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,880
Look over there.

830
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,800
Do you know what that is?

831
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Weisheng Yan’s vault.

832
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,960
You already know that?

833
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,800
Then guess

834
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,230
how much money is there?

835
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,590
Is that

836
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,670
important?

837
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,110
He’d have to be rich

838
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,360
to build

839
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,230
a vault like this.

840
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,630
I never thought

841
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,000
his home

842
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,480
would be like this.

843
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,070
Xiao.

844
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:50,710
You wanted to

845
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,760
tell me something?

846
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:53,400
No.

847
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,190
You met Weisheng Yan, right?

848
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,320
I thought

849
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,880
you had a falling out

850
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,110
with him.

851
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,230
Xiao.

852
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,440
Please get along well with him.

853
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,630
Or I’ll be caught

854
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,510
between my husband and you.

855
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,440
By the way.

856
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:22,630
Where’s Huotu Xin?

857
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:23,920
He has left.

858
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,230
Left?

859
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,920
To Zhaodu?

860
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,960
I’m not sure about this,

861
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,230
but I’ll find out.

862
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,000
Linglong entrusted us.

863
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,670
We can’t ignore him.

864
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,840
Xiao.

865
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,030
You helped Linglong leave?

866
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,440
If Linglong

867
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:46,840
is the Goddess,

868
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,400
then going to Zhaodu

869
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,760
is her only choice.

870
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,320
Linglong

871
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,670
is really a great child.
