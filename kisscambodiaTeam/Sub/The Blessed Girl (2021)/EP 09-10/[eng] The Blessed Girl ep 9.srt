24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,560
Fozhuan

25
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,520
was buried on top of Tianqi Cemetery,

26
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,030
way above

27
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
the deceased Chief Priests.

28
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,590
He once told me

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,120
that place was the closest to God.

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you.

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
Did Fozhuan

32
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
teach you those tricks?

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,120
You...

34
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,840
You knew already?

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,560
Of course.

36
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,840
You’re like a younger version of him.

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,150
Yuan Yi is right.

38
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,470
No one can fool you.

39
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,150
I thought

40
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,310
I did a flawless job.

41
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,400
Even Chief Priest held that bead,

42
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
and called it

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,870
Master Fozhuan’s core.

44
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,560
He kept yelling

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,080
that’s the holy treasure of Tianqi Sect.

46
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,310
Let him be if he insists on

47
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,520
enshrining Fozhuan’s thingy.

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,910
Fozhuan would be glad

49
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,240
that his trick fooled those old farts

50
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,470
even after his death.

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,630
Inside is

52
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,960
his ashes.

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
Did you mean to tell me the truth?

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,750
Tricks, however good they seem,

55
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,310
can’t be used on the one he loved.

56
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,120
You still have my feather.

57
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,190
I once heard from seniors

58
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,830
that nothing

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,270
could separate those in love,

60
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,720
not even death.

61
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,920
He’d turn into the spring breeze,

62
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,680
the summer rain

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,950
and find you again.

64
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,160
Do you also believe in that?

65
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,720
That’s a way

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
to make one feel better, isn’t it?

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,430
Yes.

68
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,600
At least, breeze and rain

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,310
sound much comforting

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,190
than ashes.

71
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,430
Thanks.

72
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,680
But

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
he is dead.

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,560
His life ends in this urn.

75
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,120
He wouldn’t return in any form.

76
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,560
Minister Fei,

77
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,430
words had gotten out

78
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,430
that the Ritual of Eternity

79
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,360
would be held in Zhaodu.

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,040
What?

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,630
Every fiefdom has announced it.

82
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,630
Those old dogs!

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,800
You may leave.

84
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,920
All their eyes are on you.

85
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,430
Do you know what that means?

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,950
I...

87
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,800
Over the past 500 years,

88
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,190
Suchuan has been under the Yuans’ rule

89
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,800
as they’re the royals of Immortal Blood.

90
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,360
Despite fierce wars among others,

91
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,310
the Yuans are unaffected

92
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,430
in Zhaodu.

93
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,310
The chosen one by God

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,870
is the last force

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
to maintain Suchuan’s balance.

96
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,480
I can be of help to Yuan Yi, right?

97
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,430
Why are people in awe of God?

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,720
Because in this world,

99
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,920
there is no God.

100
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,480
Out of sight, out of doubt.

101
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,510
God is merely a symbol,

102
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,950
a deterrent.

103
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,600
Others dare not to dethrone Yuan Yi

104
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,360
for fear of God.

105
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,190
Once the Ritual of Eternity completes,

106
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,630
won’t it enhance God’s influence

107
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,680
and make him more powerful

108
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,830
than a mere symbol?

109
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,680
No, you aren’t a symbol.

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,830
You’re flesh and blood

111
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,800
and visible.

112
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,360
Once you lose,

113
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,680
then

114
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,720
hundreds of years of reverence

115
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,920
towards the Yuans

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,270
will collapse.

117
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
By that time,

118
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,040
enemies all over Suchuan

119
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,070
will flood in.

120
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,070
That’s the direst consequence

121
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
of the Fall of God.

122
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,310
Those things

123
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,190
have never...

124
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,720
They’ve never occurred to you, right?

125
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,190
Then

126
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,630
why did you agree to hold that ritual?

127
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,600
I was

128
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,310
trying to stop Yuan Yi

129
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,390
from looking for God.

130
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,720
I once assumed

131
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,480
you were hired by Chief Priest

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,430
or Zhu Xi.

133
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,630
But...

134
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,480
I want to see the one Yuan Yi chose.

135
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,040
I won’t fail.

136
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,560
Thank you.

137
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,720
Don’t get me wrong.

138
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,870
I’m not helping you.

139
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,040
If you can’t prove yourself

140
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,920
at the Ritual

141
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,800
or fail to overwhelm everyone

142
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,390
with a miracle,

143
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
I’ll have to

144
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,240
execute you for deception

145
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,800
for the sake of

146
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,560
the Yuans and Suchuan.

147
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,120
Thank you for telling me all that.

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,430
It’s

149
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
totally different

150
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,750
from what Yuan Yi said

151
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,870
or what I imagined.

152
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,750
I’ve been burned by the Earth Fire

153
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,000
and hunted by Zhu Xi,

154
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,560
but never have I

155
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,830
been this scared.

156
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,430
My father is right.

157
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,040
But that’s fine.

158
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,070
Because

159
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,040
I’m Goddess.

160
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,120
Ah!

161
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Goddess.

162
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,030
She touched my hand.

163
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,720
Let me touch it!

164
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,480
Let me!

165
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,240
Please!

166
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,550
No.

167
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,910
Come on

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,480
Linglong.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,000
You’ve started to get the hang of it.

170
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,440
You’re right.

171
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,360
The world that accepts me

172
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,080
is indeed different.

173
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,720
I wish my father

174
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,670
could see this, too.

175
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Put these on.

176
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,910
They’re for me?

177
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,750
Just my size.

178
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,080
There are

179
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,150
good people in Pingting after all.

180
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,720
Sir,

181
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,240
thank you

182
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,440
for your kindness.

183
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,550
I’ll

184
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,120
repay you for it someday.

185
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,320
Sure.

186
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,080
Keep that in mind.

187
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,240
By the way,

188
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,270
may I ask you a question?

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,720
Do you know Zhaodu?

190
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,750
Are you going there?

191
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,270
It’s far from here.

192
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,150
Could you tell me the direction?

193
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,550
Good.

194
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,000
What are you doing?

195
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,200
Isn’t this how people
greet each other here?

196
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,720
Knock it off!

197
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,910
But

198
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,630
weren’t you...

199
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,550
You said you’d repay me, didn’t you?

200
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,960
There’s no such thing as a free meal.

201
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,440
You mean

202
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,750
I have to pay,

203
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,750
right?

204
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
I don’t have...

205
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,320
Sir,

206
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,910
in the Fire Tribe, we call it a...

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,200
Blood Stone.

208
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,720
It’s not worth a bun in Pingting.

209
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,030
No one wants it.

210
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,510
Then...

211
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,790
What do you want?

212
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,600
Come on! Hurry!

213
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes. Throw it in!

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,360
Go on!

215
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,120
Good.

216
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,550
Now, add some water.

217
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,270
Yes, water.

218
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,670
I mean water. Over there.

219
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,320
Sir,

220
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,240
what’s all this for?

221
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,270
I’m forging a weapon.

222
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,000
They’ve lost

223
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,200
their courage.

224
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,150
Such a battle had never been seen

225
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,480
that Kunwu’s cavalrymen swept
the West Border

226
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,510
like the sandstorm.

227
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Sand raised by hoofs

228
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,270
pierced Suchuan troops’ hearts

229
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,550
like sharp arrows.

230
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,870
Despite blood gushing out of

231
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,320
Emperor Yuan Qian’s wounds,

232
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,200
he stood still with his sword.

233
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,840
He knew

234
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,270
what behind him

235
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,360
was Suchuan.

236
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,510
God lifted the Nu River,

237
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,870
and made it fall

238
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,320
over Kunwu troops’ heads.

239
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,150
Soon, sand turned into mud.

240
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,240
The ferocious cavalrymen

241
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,960
were waist-deep in the mudbath.

242
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,720
Emperor Yuan Qian’s Sword of Kings,

243
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,550
blessed by God’s power,

244
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
was shining radiantly.

245
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,360
Thus, warriors of Suchuan

246
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,480
regained their courage.

247
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,960
That

248
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,360
was God

249
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,870
and his supreme power.

250
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,000
Sir,

251
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,000
what are those in your ears?

252
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,720
I mean your ears...

253
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,830
Look!

254
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,480
You were saying?

255
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,720
Never mind.

256
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,960
No wonder

257
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,790
you were the best blacksmith

258
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,350
in Pingting.

259
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,590
Load one stone

260
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,510
into it,

261
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,240
it can shoot 50 times.

262
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,400
Incredible!

263
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,200
I wish

264
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,880
I could have more of it.

265
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,830
You want more?

266
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,680
No problem.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,550
I can make you 50.

268
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,510
50!

269
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,000
Really?

270
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,160
Will your granddaughter agree to that?

271
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,310
Even this one

272
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,960
is made behind her back, right?

273
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,030
Don’t worry. I can handle it,

274
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,640
young man.

275
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,240
Forget it.

276
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,310
I wouldn’t dare tick her off.

277
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,830
Others begged me to make it,

278
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,680
but I said no.

279
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,110
It must be fate

280
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,400
that brought us to meet.

281
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,480
Make up your mind.

282
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,920
Do you want more or not?

283
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,960
Are you messing with me?

284
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,830
No, no, no.

285
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,000
I wouldn’t dare.

286
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,310
Aside from your granddaughter,

287
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,270
given

288
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,070
your condition,

289
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,720
I’m concerned...

290
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Don’t be.

291
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,960
I have help.

292
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,200
Is he your apprentice?

293
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,830
Be careful with it.

294
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,000
Not exactly.

295
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,070
Just a handyman.

296
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,160
What say you?

297
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,400
Alright.

298
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,750
I’ll pay

299
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,680
two gold coins

300
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,240
per piece you make.

301
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,790
Is that fair?

302
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,440
Two gold coins?

303
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,920
I’m not that expensive.

304
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,880
Excuse me?

305
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,160
It’s a deal.

306
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,270
100 gold coins

307
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,790
for 50 pieces.

308
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,790
I need a deposit, though.

309
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,960
Pay me

310
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,880
30...

311
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,440
No, 50 percent first.

312
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Deal.

313
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,880
Are you drained?

314
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,240
No.

315
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,750
Jade

316
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,270
can be found in the Fire Tribe, too.

317
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,310
It’s beautiful

318
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,160
but too fragile.

319
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,240
Can I turn this sword

320
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,480
into the unbreakable Sword of Kings?

321
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,830
Not now,

322
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,880
I’m afraid.

323
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,240
It’s not even dark

324
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,920
and you already

325
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,830
dozed off.

326
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,590
Ritual of Eternity isn’t a game.

327
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,830
Your tricks

328
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,680
won’t work there.

329
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,070
If you fail,

330
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,310
even I can’t help you.

331
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,590
Are you reprimanding me

332
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,880
as an emperor?

333
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,270
It’s not my fault.

334
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,240
Your story is too boring.

335
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,110
Story?

336
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,200
Is that what you think?

337
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,160
Am I wrong?

338
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,000
These…

339
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,920
These,

340
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,880
all of them

341
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,160
and books over there

342
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,440
tell nothing but stories, right?

343
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,160
About those things you said,

344
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
such as battling with the emperor,

345
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,000
helping him beat back enemies,

346
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,240
treating his wounds,

347
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,270
blessing Sword of Kings with power,

348
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,880
aren’t all those stories

349
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,830
between God

350
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,960
and the emperor?

351
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,440
They’re a whole,

352
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,510
safeguarding Suchuan together.

353
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,510
Honestly,

354
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,750
they can’t help me in any way.

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,480
Back in the Fire Tribe,

356
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,790
if you ask a senior,

357
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,160
he can go on and on

358
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,240
for a whole night about how warriors

359
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,920
battled the Earth Fire.

360
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,400
But nothing

361
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
explains

362
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,750
the origin of the Earth Fire

363
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,030
or why it’s been on for 500 years.

364
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,110
Yours are just the same.

365
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,070
None of them answers

366
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,640
where God is from.

367
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,830
Sometimes,

368
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
answers can’t solve problems.

369
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,240
Sir,

370
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,510
so you’re a blacksmith,

371
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,110
quite a skilled one, actually.

372
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,440
Are you also familiar with those skills?

373
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,640
I’m not,

374
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,750
but my tribesmen are.

375
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,070
Now, they can only

376
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,350
patch things up.

377
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,110
Techniques ancestors created

378
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,200
are long lost.

379
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,240
I know.

380
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,200
Ancient Fire Tribesmen developed tons of

381
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,440
excellent quenching and forging skills.

382
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,400
At that time, Jinshi City

383
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,070
was our shrine.

384
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,590
Most techniques are gone

385
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,350
but weapons ancestors forged

386
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,440
have been passed down.

387
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,920
My Fire Spear

388
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,070
is one of them.

389
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,350
Once I find my daughter,

390
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,440
you’re welcome

391
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,000
to go to our tribe

392
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
and have a look
at our ancestors’ legacies.

393
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,110
You’re going to love them.

394
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,070
I’d better stay away

395
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,510
from that sinful land.

396
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,750
How...? How is it sinful?

397
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,640
You don’t understand.

398
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,790
It’s none of your business.

399
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,960
Here.

400
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,200
No, no, no.

401
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,920
Sir,

402
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,750
that’s too generous of you.

403
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,000
I can’t thank you enough

404
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,270
for saving my life

405
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,640
and I’m obligated to help you.

406
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,070
I can’t take your money.

407
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,880
Sorry, I can’t take it.

408
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,790
That’s not for you.

409
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,590
Go to the store across the street.

410
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,590
Pick up two jars of liquor

411
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,680
and a roasted chicken.

412
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,000
Ask them for the change.

413
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,070
Put the hat on

414
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,680
to cover yourself.

415
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,030
Don’t you dare escape.

416
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,240
One step to the side

417
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,590
and I’ll shout.

418
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,070
You’re

419
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,550
worth ten gold coins.

420
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
You can’t get out of Pingting.

421
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,480
You know who I am?

422
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,110
Of course.

423
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,750
Or would I’ve brought you back?

424
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,000
Where else could I

425
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,160
get free help?

426
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,070
Go ahead.

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,720
I’ve...

428
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,440
I’ve learned about

429
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,510
the Fire Demon in your tribe.

430
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,400
It’s said she set the Earth Fire.

431
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,350
My father said

432
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,680
seniors made that up.

433
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,920
It’s not true.

434
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,510
Are you always afraid

435
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,070
it is true?

436
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,680
You’re hell-bent on
putting out the Earth Fire

437
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,510
to prove

438
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,550
your mother isn’t the Fire Demon, right?

439
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,920
No!

440
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
How could a Fire Demon

441
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,070
give birth to Goddess?

442
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,550
I said

443
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,680
it’s a cooked-up story.

444
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,510
Fine.

445
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,920
Let’s say it is.

446
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,750
What do you want to know?

447
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,110
I’ll tell you everything.

448
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,110
I have tons of questions.

449
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,000
What is God?

450
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,240
Why is it me?

451
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,240
Where is God from?

452
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,160
Did another God give birth to him?

453
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,550
If my mother was a God,

454
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,200
what about my grandmother?

455
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,790
My father is an ordinary person.

456
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,510
So

457
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,310
could a God and a person

458
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,880
create another God?

459
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,720
I’ve...

460
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
Never considered their reproduction.

461
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,160
I’m serious.

462
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,960
Why are you blushing?

463
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,000
It’s...

464
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,310
It’s never crossed my mind

465
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,480
that Goddess would discuss that with me.

466
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,160
Propagation is of great significance.

467
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,110
The Fire Tribe is sparsely populated

468
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,030
and fighting fire is dangerous.

469
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,270
We need enough populations

470
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,200
to guard the Flame Chilling Wall.

471
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,400
Unlike my father

472
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,920
who only has one daughter,

473
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,400
most families have more than one kid.

474
00:25:59,440 --> 00:25:59,830
But

475
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,550
that doesn’t

476
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,790
concern you royals,

477
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,510
does it?

478
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,510
No wonder Gods are almost extinct

479
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,070
and you’re the sole heir to the Yuans.

480
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,640
I... I’m sorry.

481
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,440
I... I crossed the line.

482
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,680
What’s up?

483
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,480
Nothing.

484
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,960
You seem spirited

485
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,750
when you’re on that subject.

486
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,510
Not true.

487
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,030
But I guess

488
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,920
you’re right.

489
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,790
This morning,

490
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,830
when I helped a maid up

491
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
by touching her slightly,

492
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,440
she became excited and yelled

493
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,880
she was blessed by Goddess.

494
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,920
Others around were eager to touch her

495
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,550
to share my blessing.

496
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
God can’t be touched

497
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,920
by ordinary people easily.

498
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,160
Of course, they were grateful.

499
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,680
When I was young,

500
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,510
people in my tribe

501
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,590
forbade their children
from playing with me.

502
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,830
They were avoiding me

503
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,110
and calling me an evil demon.

504
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,640
Because of that,

505
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,880
my father had tons of fights with them.

506
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
He called that

507
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,440
exercise.

508
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,270
Soon,

509
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,160
people of Suchuan will know the new you.

510
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,270
Then

511
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,720
we can visit your mother together.

513
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,400
Master,

514
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
news came from Zhaodu.

515
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,960
Chief Priest has notified

516
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,790
every branch of Tianqi Sect

517
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,880
that Ritual of Eternity
will soon be held

518
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,920
to announce
God’s reappearance in Suchuan.

519
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,070
That’s fast.

520
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,000
Linglong

521
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,200
is as good

522
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,400
as I expected.

523
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,110
Do you also believe in that?

524
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,720
It’s been over 500 years

525
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,030
since the last Ritual of Eternity.

526
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,960
How come people still buy that?

527
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,240
That’s why

528
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,440
we should support

529
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
our young Goddess.

530
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,590
Moon Guards tried to intercept letters

531
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,920
Chief Priest sent to all fiefdoms

532
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,270
but some still got out.

533
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,640
They’ve already known

534
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,240
we’re going to hold Ritual of Eternity

535
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,070
and they’ll use that as an excuse

536
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,480
to come to Zhaodu

537
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,590
and see

538
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,270
if Goddess is real.

539
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,200
I’m not afraid of them.

540
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,960
They refused to come

541
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,640
even if I summoned them.

542
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,240
This time, I can

543
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,510
use this chance

544
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,750
to show them how powerful Zhaodu is.

545
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,550
Fei Tian,

546
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,830
isn’t that

547
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,680
what we need Goddess for?

548
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,160
So, to you,

549
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,920
she represents Zhaodu’s power?

550
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,200
Fei Tian,

551
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,000
I appreciate all that you’ve done

552
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,790
for my family.

553
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
But we both know

554
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,790
however hard we try,

555
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,270
it doesn’t change the fact

556
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,720
that Zhaodu is isolated

557
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,030
and the Yuans are declining.

558
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,590
Linglong is our hope
to turn things around.

559
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,790
Trust me.

560
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,160
We’ll prove it to you.

561
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,200
Suchuan is yours, Your Majesty.

562
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,920
You don’t need to prove anything

563
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,550
to anyone.

564
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,070
As per the late emperor’s will,

565
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,720
I’ve found teachers for you

566
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,680
to study history, the art of war,

567
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,240
and politics.

568
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,440
I’ve rectified the court

569
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,830
and eliminated the corrupted.

570
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,400
Whatever happens in Zhaodu

571
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,830
and whatever decision

572
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,880
you make,

573
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,510
I’ll support you

574
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,400
as always.

575
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,400
But

576
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,350
I fear that I’ll disappoint you.

577
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,830
I’m

578
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,400
a member of the Moon Tribe.

579
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,070
You know,

580
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,590
we don’t worship God

581
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
but the emperor only.

582
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,110
If you do care about her,

583
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,270
make sure of her safety first.

584
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,240
If she fails at the Ritual of Eternity,

585
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,240
you’ll

586
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,270
have her killed.

587
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,680
Fei Tian!

588
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,070
Zhaodu is my city.

589
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,720
Linglong is my girl.

590
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
No one can hurt her.

591
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,920
Go get prepared.

592
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,880
Those of the Chamber of Commerce

593
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,310
will come and make a scene again.

594
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,960
They’re really

595
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,640
giving me a headache.

596
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,270
Ritual of Eternity is a huge event.

597
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,440
Marquis Pingjiang will
take advantage of it

598
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,680
to rake in money.

599
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,070
Those merchants’ pockets

600
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,720
have almost been emptied

601
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,270
by all sorts of taxes he concocted

602
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,270
over the years.

603
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,440
They can’t wait for you

604
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,160
to marry Miss Yin

605
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
and gain her family’s support

606
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,240
to back the Chamber of Commerce

607
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,750
and battle Marquis Pingjiang.

608
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,400
Where are the two siblings?

609
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,070
Touring around the city

610
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,680
as you asked.

611
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,350
I want to eat this.

612
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,720
Lanterns!

613
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,160
All new lanterns!

614
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,750
Miss, would you like a lantern?

615
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,310
It’s of the latest style.

616
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,720
Round lanterns!

617
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,070
It tastes so good!

618
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,070
This place was the size of tofu

619
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,240
from Weisheng Yan’s place.

620
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
I didn’t know it’d be

621
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,270
so crowded and bustling

622
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,720
until we came here ourselves.

623
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,030
Back on the Bright Moon Island,
I heard Pingting was big

624
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,960
but it’s actually bigger than I thought.

625
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,920
How could we find Huotu Xin

626
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,920
in such a large city?

627
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,960
Just wait and see

628
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,790
if Weisheng Yan is a man of his word.

629
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,750
Weisheng Yan?

630
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,200
Yin Zhuang,

631
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,270
do you know

632
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,270
what kind of person he is?

633
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,510
He’s rich.

634
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,200
We’ve stayed

635
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,830
at his house for days

636
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,590
without seeing him once.

637
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,030
Don’t you find that strange?

638
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,830
I’m too busy

639
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,030
getting used to new things here

640
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,350
to think about him.

641
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,590
I still think

642
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
it’s a hasty decision

643
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,640
for you two to get married.

644
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,440
Xiao, you’re thinking too much.

645
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,310
Father’s decision

646
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,510
can’t be wrong.

647
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,440
But he has...

648
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,310
Left us.

649
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,480
Alright.

650
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,400
I know

651
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,640
you hate to see me leave,

652
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,750
don’t you?

653
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,790
I knew it.

654
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,350
But

655
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,160
I can’t stay with you forever.

656
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,110
Soon, I’ll become

657
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,200
too old

658
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
to get married.

659
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,310
No, you won’t!

660
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,720
Yes, I will.

661
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,830
I know that for a fact.

662
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,550
Girls should

663
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,680
have a grand wedding

664
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,110
in the most beautiful gown

665
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,590
when they’re the prettiest.

666
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,880
Look.

667
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,440
We’re in Pingting,

668
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,360
the richest city in Suchuan,

669
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,320
and the place you need to conquer.

670
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,590
Xiao,

671
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,880
I’m just a girl.

672
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,800
All I need

673
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,230
is to live a well-off life

674
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,590
and not to bring shame on our family.

675
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
But you’re different.

676
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,110
You’re the eldest son.

677
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,920
It’s your responsibility

678
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,440
to revitalize the Yin family.

679
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,360
Do you remember

680
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,230
what Juan said on the fishing boat?

681
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,070
This is Pingting,

682
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,480
not Bright Moon Island.

683
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,550
So

684
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,760
you should learn

685
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,150
to let me go.

686
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,510
How do I look?

687
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,110
You look great.

688
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,280
Let’s go.

689
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,920
He’s handsome!

690
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Look how adorable

691
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,150
the local girls are.

692
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,280
You should

693
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,150
look around

694
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
and meet new people.

695
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,550
I know.

696
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,480
Come.

697
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,880
Let’s go shopping.

698
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,510
Look,

699
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:30,880
these are

700
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,110
the finest fabrics.

701
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,630
This one is good.

702
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,550
I like it.

703
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,190
Take a look.

704
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,760
Are there other fabrics?

705
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,110
What about those in this color?

706
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
The pattern is nice.

707
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,840
That’s not to my taste.

708
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,630
There’s more over there.

709
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,000
Xiao,

710
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,440
these fabrics are beautiful!

711
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,190
I can’t imagine how gorgeous

712
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,670
the dresses made of these will look.

713
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,230
Choose any fabric you like.

714
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,360
I’ll bag it for you.

715
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,630
Thanks.

716
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,030
Let me see those in different colors.

717
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,880
Look at these.

718
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,550
Sure.

719
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,360
Miss,

720
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,710
are you into this fabric?

721
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,360
You have good taste.

722
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,190
There’s only one piece

723
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,550
in town

724
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,840
and it’s been made into a dress.

725
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,590
Miss,

726
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,440
you can try it on.

727
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,630
Can I?

728
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,280
Someone must’ve

729
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,590
ordered that dress.

730
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,630
Don’t worry.

731
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,760
Feel free to try it on.

732
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,070
If you don’t like it,

733
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,670
we have other styles for you to choose.

734
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,400
Go put it on if you like.

735
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,030
Bring me the dress.

736
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:46,710
Yes.

737
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,960
Do I look good?

738
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,960
Xiao,

739
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,710
you don’t need to buy it for me.

740
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,400
It’s on the house.

741
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,400
This dress

742
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,760
is made for you.

743
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,280
What do you mean?

744
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,030
Is it you in the drawing?

745
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,480
That’s...

746
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,840
We have dresses your size

747
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,110
made of all kinds of fabrics

748
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,630
in our store.

749
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,670
Not just us.

750
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,550
A few days ago,

751
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,800
every store in town

752
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,360
received your portrait.

753
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,440
Wherever you go

754
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,070
and whatever you like,

755
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,710
we’ve had everything ready for you.

756
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,630
No wonder it fits me perfectly.

757
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,710
Is all that Weisheng Yan’s arrangement?

758
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,030
Yes.

759
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,230
He’s

760
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,280
surprisingly considerate.

761
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,480
Miss,

762
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,480
would you like matching headwear?

763
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,840
It’ll make you look

764
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
even better.

765
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,000
Why not?

766
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,760
That dress

767
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,840
is yours.

768
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,710
The fabric left will be destroyed.

769
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,150
That’s unnecessary.

770
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,440
Don’t waste it.

771
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,800
Weisheng Yan

772
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,670
doesn’t allow others

773
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,190
to wear the same dresses as yours.

774
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,760
Weisheng Yan,

775
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,440
when will it be?

776
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,070
Soon.

777
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,630
Marquis Pingjiang

778
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,480
is one step away

779
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,110
from emptying my vault himself.

780
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,920
Yes, Weisheng Yan.

781
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,670
Over the past year,

782
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,960
he’s taken money

783
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,480
from my business

784
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,320
in all kinds of names.

785
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,440
Now,

786
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,360
Zhaodu is suddenly

787
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,760
holding some

788
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,280
Ritual of Eternity.

789
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,760
Who knows

790
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,440
how much more he needs

791
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,590
to present Goddess in Zhaodu?

792
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,400
Just wait for it!

793
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,030
Goddess is Suchuan’s guardian.

794
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,030
No disrespect is allowed.

795
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,550
Guardian my foot!

796
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,150
If Goddess could keep me
from being robbed,

797
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,440
I’d fall prostrate in worship.

798
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,480
I don’t buy those corny tales.

799
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,230
The Yuans

800
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,230
must be cornered by the nobility

801
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,630
and they’re desperate

802
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
to assert their dominance.

803
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,480
Back to business.

804
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,960
Don’t go off-topic.

805
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,150
I’m asking you.

806
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,230
Tell me,

807
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,110
when are you

808
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,230
going to marry Miss Yin?

809
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,920
Aren’t you going to

810
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,960
other stores?

811
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,670
No.

812
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,320
They all have my portraits.

813
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,760
If I go,

814
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,400
more things will go to waste.

815
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,110
However rich Weisheng Yan is,

816
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,400
it’s wrong to squander money like this.

817
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,760
I’ll talk to him.

818
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,590
Ritual of Eternity.

819
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,150
What is that?

820
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,800
It’s to announce God’s reappearance.

821
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,480
Bullcrap!

822
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,320
There’s no God

823
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,150
in the world.

824
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,400
There is.

825
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,630
According to my grandfather,

826
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,920
our ancestors

827
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,320
used to be God’s servants.

828
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,510
<i>Notice</i>
Back in the day,

829
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,230
God could control the weather.

830
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,510
God or no God,

831
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,150
it has nothing to do with us.

832
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
That’s wrong.

833
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,280
It’s said

834
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,800
God’s reappearance is a warning.

835
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,670
Those bad people

836
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,510
will get punished.

837
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,150
Let’s go.

838
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,550
Linglong did it.

839
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,880
She was accepted by Zhaodu.

840
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:22,800
Yes.

841
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,070
But she still has to

842
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,710
go through the Ritual of Eternity.

843
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
With God’s reappearance,
the Yuans’ rejuvenation

844
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,880
and our family’s resurgence,

845
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,320
restoring Suchuan to its former glory

846
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,710
can be expected.

847
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,400
Look around.

848
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,000
Does anyone care about that?

849
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:44,920
We still

850
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,230
have a long way ahead.

851
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,070
It must be tough for Linglong

852
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,920
to be in Zhaodu alone.

853
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,590
We must find Huotu Xin quickly.

854
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,320
Look.

855
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:03,340
<i>Wanted Reward: Ten coins.</i>

856
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,710
Zhu Xi has made Huotu Xin a wanted man.

857
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,110
Isn’t he in danger?

858
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,150
Yin Zhuang,

859
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,150
go back first.

860
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,360
I’ll go ask around.

861
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,320
Xiao,

862
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,000
are you letting me

863
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,760
go back alone?

864
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,280
Aren’t you worried about my safety?

865
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,670
See those two?

866
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,150
They’re Weisheng Yan’s men.

867
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,440
They’ve been following us all day.

868
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,110
You’re safe with them.

869
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,710
Be careful.

870
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,230
Weisheng Yan,

871
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,840
you’ve promised us

872
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,710
that you’ll hook on to the Yins

873
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,150
to battle Marquis Pingjiang.

874
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,880
That’s why we invested

875
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,030
in your chamber.

876
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,000
It’s been days

877
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,230
since Miss Yin arrived.

878
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,550
Nothing has happened.

879
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,190
What’s going on?

880
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,550
Has she

881
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,710
turned you down,

882
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,590
Weisheng Yan?

883
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,510
Did you use the Yins

884
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,480
to coax us into investing in you?

885
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,630
The Yins are going downhill

886
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,710
but they’re still the oldest

887
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,150
and most prestigious family in Suchuan.

888
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,840
What’s that saying?

889
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,000
A lean camel is bigger than a horse.

890
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,960
As lean as it is,

891
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,360
it doesn’t eat dog food.

892
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,440
Shut up.

893
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,670
Don’t show off your ignorance.

894
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,230
Anyone else is better than you.

895
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,230
You’re simply jealous because

896
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,880
he’s getting married with Miss Yin.

897
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,550
You... You stay out of it.

898
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,070
It’s for everyone’s sake.

899
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,760
We all have concerns,

900
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,400
right?

901
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,070
It’s the heiress to the Yins.

902
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,230
A Yin, you know?

903
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,960
She isn’t like those harlots

904
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,320
you can buy in brothels.

905
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,230
Her family is renowned.

906
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,320
You know what?

907
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,960
That chick at Fuyan House

908
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,590
is as good as Miss Yin

909
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,590
if not better.

910
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,550
Her pretty face

911
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,030
and dainty hands...

912
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,840
Master! Master!

913
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,440
Weisheng Yan,

914
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,630
are they all your friends

915
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,360
in the Chamber?

916
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,880
It’s dry lately.

917
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,030
Make some tea

918
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,000
with the green tea I brought from home

919
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,400
for everyone

920
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,480
to taste.

921
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,440
Yes.

922
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,710
Miss... Miss Yin Zhuang.

923
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,070
Greetings, Miss Yin.

924
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,400
I apologize

925
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,670
for barging in like this.

926
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,670
My brother and I are new here.

927
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,150
I appreciate your hospitality these days

928
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,760
and I should’ve

929
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,670
visited you long ago.

930
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,800
That’s too kind of you.

931
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,880
We owe you an apology.

932
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,070
In this case,

933
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,510
should I leave

934
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,190
so that

935
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,670
you can continue

936
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,800
discussing your business

937
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,230
or may I stay

938
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,960
so that we can discuss

939
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,400
our marriage together?

940
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,400
I’ll

941
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,320
see you around.

942
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,030
Good day.

943
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:46,510
Miss Yin.

944
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,440
-Let’s go.
-How gorgeous!

945
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,630
Come on.

946
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,630
Take your eyes off her.

947
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
She’ll never be yours.

948
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,670
What a beauty!

949
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,030
-She’s incredible!
-Enough!

950
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,670
She’s prettier
than those in the drawings.

951
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,670
Go date your chick in the brothel.
