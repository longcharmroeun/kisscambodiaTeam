<i>Episode 10</i>

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
Miss, you are back so early?

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Early?

26
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,840
If I’m a little late,

27
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,400
I can’t see this.

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
Miss, don’t get mad.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,910
I didn’t mean to hide it from you.

30
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,520
It’s just you boarded
the ship hurriedly,

31
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,240
mistaking me as the ship owner.

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,560
And later,

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,710
there were so many accidents.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,190
I didn’t find a chance

35
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,470
to explain this to you.

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,030
So you decided to

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,240
use these to please me in Pingting

38
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,360
before telling me the whole thing?

39
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,560
Well...

40
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,280
Is it useful?

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,590
You’re as noble as a fairy.

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,840
I’m afraid you mind I’m a businessman,

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,310
old and ugly.

44
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,910
Don’t pretend to be modest anymore.

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,080
Since I agreed to your proposal,

46
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,240
I will do everything I can

47
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,240
to help you,

48
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,520
including your Chamber of Commerce.

49
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,190
Of course.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,590
as your wife,

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,470
I will get what I want,

52
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,800
right?

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,430
Of course.

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,080
But

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
before making a deal with me,

56
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,710
you’d better think it through.

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,030
You started from scratch and

58
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,120
became the richest person in Suchuan.

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
Everyone knows your story.

60
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,680
As you said,

61
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,520
to make a deal with you,

62
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,750
of course I’ve thought it thoroughly.

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,030
What do you mean?

64
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,360
I will be your good wife,

65
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,240
but you have to help my brother

66
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,120
revive the Yins.

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,830
Since it’s a business,

68
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,920
the more you pay,

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
the more your brother

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
will get.

71
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,120
Here is all I have.

72
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,950
you can see it clearly.

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
You can get anything

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
as you want.

75
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,310
Then I have to think it over.

76
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,510
How about making babies?

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
It’s perfectly justified.

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,920
It’s not one, two, or three,

79
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,800
but nine in total.

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,720
It depends on your ability.

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
Good.

82
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,390
Out of home,

83
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,560
you’re Mrs. Weisheng,

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,920
Yins’ daughter.

85
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,800
I’ll pretend to respect you like guests,

86
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,390
and treat you with courtesy.

87
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
What you eat, wear and use

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,430
will be the best.

89
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,510
But you should know,

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,870
I offer you the most expensive clothes

91
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
is to allow you to act as

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,750
a noble lady.

93
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,510
When at home,

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
you’re my wife.

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,680
You have to do

96
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,680
what I ask you to.

97
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,680
Okay.

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
What are you waiting for?

99
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,720
Take off.

100
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,240
I mean,

101
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,270
take off your clothes.

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,750
Continue.

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,390
Enough, enough.

104
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,070
I can’t pretend anymore.

105
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,310
I’m so sorry.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,310
I just want to have a try.

107
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,240
I’ve never ordered

108
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,310
a noble lady before.

109
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,560
I’m a little slaphappy.

110
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,240
Sorry.

111
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,310
But

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,190
Miss Yin Zhuang,

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,270
you are a little different

114
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,510
from what I expected.

115
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,160
But you are exactly what

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,950
I thought you were.

117
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,950
Anyway, I don’t care.

118
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,800
I just need you to fulfill

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,920
your promise to the Yins.

120
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,720
Besides,

121
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,310
I want you to promise me

122
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,160
another condition.

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,310
What’s it?

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,750
In front of my brother,

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,630
you should care about me, protect me,

126
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,480
and take good care of me.

127
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,480
Okay.

128
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,270
I promise.

129
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,310
Miss, where are you going?

130
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,680
Continue to go shopping.

131
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,160
I won’t save money for you.

132
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,950
I will never break

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,120
my promise to the Yins.

134
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,270
How do you know my size?

135
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,310
Eye survey.

136
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:23,750
Continue! Continue! Continue!

137
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,270
Who are you?

138
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,790
Who are you?

139
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,790
Take me to him.

140
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,390
He is not here.

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
Wanted?

142
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,200
<i>Wanted</i>
This Wanted...

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,750
I saw many robbers acting like a cop.

144
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,600
Say.

145
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,840
Where is he?

146
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,200
He’s rescued by someone.

147
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
No one knows where he is now.

148
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,790
Rescued?

149
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:25,960
By whom?

150
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,550
I don’t know.

151
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,910
I really don’t know.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,600
The shift on duty that day

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,670
were killed by the Marquis.

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,120
Please spare my life.

155
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
I really don’t know.

156
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,000
It has nothing to do with me.

157
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
I really don’t know.

158
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,360
What a spacious house!

159
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,440
Come here!

160
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,200
You sleep here tonight.

161
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,670
Tidy it now.

162
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,200
It’s clean.

163
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,320
Why do you shake it?

164
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,510
So... Sorry.

165
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,240
Are you alright?

166
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,320
Do you need a physician?

167
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,200
No need.

168
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,510
Come on, tidy it and have a rest.

169
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,270
Tomorrow,

170
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,550
we’ll continue the work.

171
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,750
Sir,

172
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,960
I... I tell you,

173
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,550
I...
I really have something urgent to do.

174
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,670
I can’t help you work.

175
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,120
None of my business.

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,440
Sir,

177
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,750
I... I am a wanted criminal.

178
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,200
If the soldiers find that

179
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,030
I’m here with you,

180
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,030
it’s bad for you.

181
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,150
It’s none of your business.

182
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,910
Sir, I really can’t persuade you.

183
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,840
What about this?

184
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,870
I’ll help you work for more days,

185
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,670
and deliver the goods for you.

186
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,480
It’s my reward to you.

187
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,320
But

188
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,440
can you do me a favor?

189
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,870
I’d like to ask you something.

190
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,750
Seventeen years ago,

191
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,720
in Pingting,

192
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,840
a girl named Jin’er got lost.

193
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,150
Do you know?

194
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,270
There are so many girls

195
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,320
named Jin’er.

196
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,630
How do I know?

197
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,480
Well, wait for a moment.

198
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,790
What a trouble!

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,720
Wait for a moment.

200
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,320
Not long, not long.

201
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,840
I’ll finish soon.

202
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,150
Sir,

203
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,720
you’re a blacksmith.

204
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,960
Have you seen

205
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,150
such a tattoo?

206
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,510
What did you draw?

207
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,360
I don’t understand.

208
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,240
Look... Look carefully.

209
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,440
Have you seen it?

210
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,550
How can you make a deal with me?

211
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,790
If you don’t want to work here,

212
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,960
just go back

213
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,030
to Zhu Xi’s prison.

214
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,320
Go.

215
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,150
If I really want to leave,

216
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,270
you can’t stop me.

217
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,390
You can have a try!

218
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,600
I...

219
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,720
Boss, bill.

220
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,600
Sir.

221
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,840
You needn’t pay the bill.

222
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,630
You have my portrait, too?

223
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,960
Who are you?

224
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,150
Starlight Sword.

225
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,200
Surely you’re Mr. Yin Xiao.

226
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,670
You’re from Moon Tribe.

227
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,120
I have a letter from Zhaodu.

228
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,320
Please

229
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,270
send my apologies

230
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,320
to His Majesty and Linglong.

231
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,480
I will find Huotu Xin

232
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,000
and protect him.

233
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,870
No news is good news.

234
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,790
Both Zhu Xi and Weisheng Yan
are looking for him.

235
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,840
It means

236
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,480
he’s safe now.

237
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,150
Is Linglong

238
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,790
really the Goddess?

239
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,870
She needs to prove it

240
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,270
by the Ritual of Eternity.

241
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,840
Will she be put to death

242
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,720
if she fails?

243
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,240
You’re moving
under the monitor of Zhu Xi.

244
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,600
You must be careful.

245
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,240
Lord.

246
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,910
Go,

247
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,750
send this letter to Zhaodu.

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,960
Everything goes well in Pingting.

249
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:26,790
Aye.

250
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,360
Well,

251
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,390
the messenger from Moon Tribe...

252
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,270
You still need my instruction?

253
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,150
No.

254
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,910
Linglong,

255
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,480
why are you having a meal here?

256
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,440
What are you reading?

257
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,870
Nothing.

258
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,600
If I eat in my room,

259
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,630
a lot of maids would stand there,

260
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,440
offering dishes

261
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,720
or passing towel for me.

262
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,960
I’m not used to it.

263
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,750
No one dares to enter your study.

264
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,120
You can ask them to leave.

265
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,390
Then they will stand at the door,

266
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,790
looking at me,

267
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,790
waiting for me to finish.

268
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,480
Don’t you think it’s suffering?

269
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,670
Even so, you can’t sit on the bookshelf.

270
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,150
There are so many reports on your desk.

271
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,150
I dare not sit there.

272
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,360
Alright.

273
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,870
I’ll ask them

274
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,390
to send my dishes here.

275
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,320
Let’s eat together.

276
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,030
If so, a lot of people will come here

277
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,000
to serve you.

278
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,440
I’m leaving now.

279
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,240
What’s wrong?

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,720
Am I annoying you?

281
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,440
If you don’t like others to serve you,

282
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
how did you get this bowl of food?

283
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,790
It looks good and tasty.

284
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,360
I got it in the kitchen.

285
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,750
Linglong,

286
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,270
you are the Goddess.

287
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,120
How can you steal food from the kitchen

288
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,910
just because you don’t want trouble?

289
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,270
It’s not the first day you know me.

290
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,350
Or

291
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,110
do you think I’m

292
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
not dignified and good-mannered?

293
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,440
It’s against the rule?

294
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,200
Rule?

295
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,830
Even I dare not set a rule for you.

296
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,270
Who dares

297
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:16,880
in Suchuan?

298
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,750
I’ll get another bowl for you next time.

299
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,830
Where is Weisheng Yan?

300
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,400
Mr. Yin Xiao.

301
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,110
Master is at Miss Yin’s room.

302
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,960
I didn’t ask

303
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,200
anything about this necklace.

304
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I just had a glance at it.

305
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,240
How do you know I like it?

306
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,270
If I’d like to,

307
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,000
I would know it.

308
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,880
If so,

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,590
I dare not go shopping in the future.

310
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,960
If only you like it.

311
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,110
I know you want to please me.

312
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,680
But it’s not good

313
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,110
to our Yins’ reputation.

314
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,880
If it causes rumors,

315
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,550
how could my brother

316
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,030
build prestige in Pingting?

317
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,240
That’s right.

318
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,720
It’s my fault.
I just want to please you.

319
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,960
I didn’t think so much.

320
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,070
I’ll put it on.

321
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,440
Speaking of your brother,

322
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,960
I have to think about

323
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,070
how to make him forgive me.

324
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,750
Don’t worry.

325
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,830
As long as I like it,

326
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,640
my brother will understand.

327
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,880
That’s good.

328
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,510
That’s good.

329
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,960
Do you like it?

330
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,640
Of course I do.

331
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,270
This is the life I dreamed of.

332
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,750
Yin Zhuang,

333
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,920
I will let you live

334
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
a life you never imagined before.

335
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,830
I believe you.

337

My brother has already left.

338
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,440
I know.

339
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,070
So you have to listen to me.

340
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,790
It’s really beautiful.

341
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,160
Your handkerchief

342
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,440
is beautiful.

343
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,830
You mean this?

344
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,030
This fire

345
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,440
is the pattern of our Fire Tribe.

346
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,160
Looks good, right?

347
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,270
This is made by my father.

348
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,030
If you like it,

349
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,590
I can ask my father to make one for you.

350
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,790
I don’t need

351
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,640
a handkerchief

352
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,640
made by your father.

353
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,030
What?

354
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,160
Nothing.

355
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,000
You have finished reading

356
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,110
so many books?

357
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,400
What are you looking for?

358
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,350
Nothing.

359
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,830
Well...

360
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,270
Did you read this book?

361
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:23,480
Yes.

362
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,240
I’ve read the name list

363
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,720
of the ladies to be your wife, too.

364
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,270
No wonder you behave so strangely today.

365
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,240
Is it that you heard I chose some ladies

366
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,310
and you are jealous?

367
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,350
Whether you have a wife or not

368
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,720
has nothing to do with me.

369
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,550
You remind me of that.

370
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,720
In a few months,

371
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Chief Priest will start to

372
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,030
choose ladies for me again.

373
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,240
In fact,

374
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,510
all of these ladies are

375
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,880
dignified, good-mannered,

376
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,350
sweet and elegant.

377
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,160
Even a duke’s daughter

378
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,960
put a handkerchief

379
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,110
in her name card.

380
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,350
You want this?

381
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,510
Give me.

382
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,240
Get it!

383
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,510
How come you hit me?

384
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,000
What’s wrong?

385
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,550
Didn’t you ask what I’m reading?

386
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,750
This is

387
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,880
the name list of Tianqi’s followers.

388
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,400
What’s wrong?

389
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,920
Are you

390
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,400
looking for this?

391
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,030
There must be a problem.

392
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,960
Sixteen years ago,

393
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,350
Zhaodu got the news that

394
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,590
Pillar of Eternity was lit
at Fire Tribe,

395
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,240
and sent some people to check it,

396
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
but nothing was found.

397
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,160
Yes.

398
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,920
So I checked the record.

399
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,160
A total of nine followers

400
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,480
were sent to Fire Tribe back then.

401
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,200
But these nine people

402
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,960
died in ten years

403
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,790
because of illness

404
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,440
or accident.

405
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,310
No one is alive now.

406
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,550
You mean

407
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,880
Chief Priest is hiding something?

408
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,960
It’s only him who knows it.

409
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,640
Goddess,

410
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,830
I can’t answer

411
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,510
your question.

412
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,550
You don’t know

413
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,240
how the Goddess comes from, either?

414
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,070
If you don’t know,

415
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,350
how can you be sure I’m the Goddess?

416
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,510
Goddess

417
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,310
is linked by blood

418
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,720
with the royals of the Yuans.

419
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,160
His Majesty found you.

420
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,640
It’ll never be wrong.

421
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,550
But His Majesty found me

422
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,680
under your instruction,

423
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,790
didn’t he?

424
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,640
No, no, no.

425
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,000
In the unseen world,

426
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,920
it’s the Goddess

427
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,310
who guided His Majesty.

428
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,070
But isn’t it you who

429
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,880
told His Majesty that

430
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,590
sixteen years ago,

431
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,310
Pillar of Eternity was lit
at Fire Tribe?

432
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,270
Yes.

433
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,920
If so,

434
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,550
the Goddess is so important to Suchuan.

435
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,350
Did you send anyone

436
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,480
to check it at the Fire Tribe?

437
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,000
Of course.

438
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,920
But

439
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,510
we had found nothing.

440
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,790
If we had the news

441
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,310
of the Goddess that year,

442
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,880
Tianqi

443
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,830
needn’t wait for so long

444
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,270
before you arrive here.

445
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,590
Found nothing?

446
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,590
It’s an important matter that

447
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
Pillar of Eternity was lit.

448
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,640
Back then,

449
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,510
the followers sent to Fire Tribe

450
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,070
were grouped by three people.

451
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,110
They monitored each other.

452
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,750
After returning to Zhaodu,

453
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,680
they were separated

454
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,270
and described the situations
in Fire Tribe.

455
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,640
I’ve checked

456
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,270
those records,

457
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,240
but there is nothing unusual.

458
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,680
Goddess,

459
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,070
do you want to check them?

460
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,830
No need.

461
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,680
I’ve checked them.

462
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,790
You’re brilliant.

463
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,830
But

464
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,200
since I was born,

465
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,310
I’ve never left Fire Tribe.

466
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,110
Why didn’t I hear

467
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,110
someone went there

468
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,400
and looked for the Goddess?

469
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,400
Well,

470
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,270
I’m afraid only the then Chief Priest,

471
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,680
my master,

472
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,440
knew the answer.

473
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,440
Your master?

474
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,720
Where is he?

475
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,590
My master

476
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,200
is buried

477
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,240
below Fozhuan’s tomb.

478
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,590
Linglong,

479
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,270
do you have the answer?

480
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,200
Nine people

481
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,510
died successively in ten years.

482
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,200
It’s definitely not a coincidence.

483
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,070
What on earth did they find?

484
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,400
Do you still think

485
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,200
Chief Priest is hiding something?

486
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,750
My intuition tells me that

487
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,480
Chief Priest surely knows something.

488
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,880
Intuition?

489
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,070
Why are you laughing?

490
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,480
My intuition is really...

491
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,110
Accurate?

492
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,350
Anyway,

493
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,310
it’s my intuition to follow you.

494
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,400
Do you think it’s accurate or not?

495
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,310
Yes.

496
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,440
Father,

497
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,680
I’ve sworn that

498
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,680
I can revive the Yins

499
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,350
by myself.

500
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,110
But you still decided to

501
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,350
marry Yin Zhuang to Weisheng Yan.

502
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,270
When you were alive,

503
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,720
I couldn’t stop you from doing so.

504
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,160
Now you’re not here,

505
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,030
I still can’t stop it.

506
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,270
You said,

507
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,440
I don’t know

508
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,310
what Yin Zhuang’s felicity is.

509
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,680
Yes.

510
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,000
I don’t know.

511
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,240
But do you really know?

512
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,110
It’s too cold.

513
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,240
Too hot!

514
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,000
The members of Fire Tribe
are born to resist heat.

515
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
Even you ask me to
put my hands in boiling water,

516
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,880
I won’t feel hot.

517
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,400
Take it.

518
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,160
What...

519
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:52,790
What’s it?

520
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,960
Measure the temperature with it.

521
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,160
It’s too hot when it turns dark.

522
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,960
It’s good if it doesn’t change.

523
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,960
What does this mean?

524
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,590
That’s killing hot!

525
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,070
Are you going to scald me to death?

526
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,310
Come on! Be quick!

527
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,160
Don’t waste time.

528
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,830
Unsatisfied.

529
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,680
Thinking I’m slow.

530
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,790
Why not ask your granddaughter
to look after you?

531
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,680
These are city guards.

532
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,350
Curfew time.

533
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,200
Don’t run about.

534
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,030
They come at the right time.

535
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,680
Sir,

536
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,590
I won’t stay here anymore.

537
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,510
I’m leaving now.

538
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,110
If you want to shout,

539
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,160
please be louder.

540
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,030
Are you mad?

541
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,750
Come back.

542
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,550
Come back.

543
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,640
Are you crazy?

544
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,960
Sir.

545
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,750
Shout!

546
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,200
Send me out!

547
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
You can get ten coins.

548
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,920
I... I don’t want it.

549
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
You... Come back.

550
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,590
If you don’t shout,

551
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,240
I’ll do it.

552
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,070
What will you shout?

553
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,110
Help!

554
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Catch the criminal!

555
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,550
Here’s the criminal!

556
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,480
Here.

557
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,550
Help!

558
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,590
Here’s the criminal!

559
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,680
Here’s the criminal!

560
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,350
Don’t shout!

561
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,550
My silly son is drunk.

562
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,110
Mistake!

563
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,960
-It’s not a mistake!
-Mistake!

564
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,960
I’m the criminal!

565
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,510
Catch me!

566
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,310
Please leave now!

567
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,000
Follow us!

568
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,590
You bastard!

569
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,960
Didn’t your mother teach you
to respect the seniors?!

570
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,240
He’s my man.

571
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,550
Get lost!

572
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,350
Yes!

573
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,510
Wu Yuan.

574
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,920
It’s really you.

575
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,880
Sir.

576
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,720
Your granddaughter is back.

577
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,200
You know it?

578
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,790
Of course I do.

579
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,240
I’m not stupid.

580
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,480
I tell you!

581
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,750
If you dare to put my grandfather
in danger again,

582
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:53,960
I’ll kill you!

583
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,960
You think I’m dangerous.

584
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,920
If you think so, you should ask

585
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,960
your grandfather to stay away from me.

586
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,160
How do you know it?

587
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,030
This drug can cure your wound.

588
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,160
You’ll be recovered

589
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,350
as well as before.

590
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,750
I didn’t think this drug bag

591
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,590
is yours long ago.

592
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,270
Say it.

593
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,510
Tell me everything

594
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,270
you know.

595
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,030
I won’t escape anymore.

596
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,480
You were caught at Zhu Xi’s prison.

597
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,880
You’re still keeping my drug bag.

598
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,310
Do you really

599
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,200
have feelings for me?

600
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,790
Do you think any man

601
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,960
can be induced by you?

602
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,750
Do you only know this trick?

603
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,200
Your grandfather is watching.

604
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
As a woman,

605
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,830
do you know what shame is?

606
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,200
Shut up your dirty mouth!

607
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,550
You...

608
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,550
Grandpa!

609
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,200
Look.

610
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,590
Your grandfather can’t watch it anymore.

611
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,480
Leave here now.

612
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,960
I won’t help you anymore.

613
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,960
Help me?

614
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
Aren’t you ashamed?

615
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,440
Since the first day I met you,

616
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,590
I was wanted

617
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,670
by various people.

618
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,400
Only you are helping me, right?

619
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,550
I think,

620
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,840
you’re the most vicious one.

621
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,190
I said shut up your dirty mouth!

622
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,150
Get lost now!

623
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,710
Showed your true colors?

624
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,000
Let your grandpa see

625
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,800
what kind of person you are!

626
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,110
You... You...

627
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,510
You...

628
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,070
You...

629
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,480
Grandpa!

630
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,280
Are you alright? Grandpa!

631
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,280
Grandpa!

632
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,320
Are you alright?

633
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,280
-Sir, are you alright?
-Grandpa.

634
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,150
Go!

635
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,800
Grandpa.

636
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,880
Grandpa.

637
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,480
Go.

638
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,030
Grandpa.

639
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,670
Take a deep breath.

640
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,480
Take a deep breath.

641
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,590
Grandpa.

642
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,070
Come on.

643
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,070
Take a deep breath.

644
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,280
Here I come.

645
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,590
Here.

646
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,360
Inhale.

647
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,230
Breathe in.

648
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,360
What are you doing?

649
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,880
I... I’m saving him.

650
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,280
What’s this?

651
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,360
Breathe in. Inhale.

652
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,150
Cattle sand.

653
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,190
Cattle sand?

654
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,400
Cattle sand is poisonous.

655
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,000
He’ll be fine.

656
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,710
Don’t do it!

657
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,480
Get off him!

658
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,840
Grandpa.

659
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,800
Are you alright?

660
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,190
Grandpa.

661
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,440
He’s fine.

662
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,440
Are you alright?

663
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,320
What... What’s wrong?

664
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,320
From now on,

665
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,800
don’t speak with

666
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,480
my granddaughter like this!

667
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,840
What do you know?

668
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,280
You know nothing.

669
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,760
Grandpa, calm down.

670
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,710
Calm down.

671
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,190
Calm down.

672
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
One, two, three, four...

673
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,710
ten coins, no more, no less.

674
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,880
Do you have a heart?

675
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,550
Why did you sell our daughter?

676
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,110
Return this money to them.

677
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,710
Get away!

678
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,360
Return to them! Return to them!

679
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,360
Come. Go!

680
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,440
Mother!

681
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,960
Let’s go!

682
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,320
No!

683
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,880
Don’t catch her! Let me go!

684
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,360
I’ve never paid ten coins

685
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,630
for such a small girl.

686
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,920
-Don’t catch her!
-Mother!

687
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,760
Be content!

688
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,920
-She’ll have good clothes.
-Let me go!

689
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,070
She’ll live a better life than you.

690
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,630
Mother!

691
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,110
-Mother!
-Give me my daughter!

692
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,630
Mother!

693
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,670
You cried.

694
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,360
No. Just a nightmare.

695
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,590
You lied.

696
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,030
You dreamed sad things?

697
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,960
What are you doing here?

698
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,630
Is it related to your parents?

699
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,630
I’m quite familiar with the way

700
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,550
you behaved in your dream and the voice.

701
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,360
Linglong is like you in her childhood.

702
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,590
But

703
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,590
she never admitted

704
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,400
she dreamed of her mother,

705
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,070
but she called her mother in her dream.

706
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,070
Listen,

707
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,190
I only have my grandpa.

708
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,840
No parents.

709
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,670
Sorry.

710
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,880
I shouldn’t have said that

711
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,630
to you

712
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,480
in front of your grandpa.

713
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,000
After all,

714
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,000
you saved me many times.

715
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,800
It’s nothing.

716
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,630
After all,

717
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,590
what you said is right.

718
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,840
Yesterday...

719
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,550
Were you going to thank me

720
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,670
for saving your grandpa?

721
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,070
I wanted to ask you

722
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,480
why cattle sand can save my grandpa?

723
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,670
I don’t know.

724
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,440
We all use this in Fire Tribe.

725
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,320
It seems your grandpa

726
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,360
is seriously ill.

727
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,960
You said

728
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,190
you want to make a deal with me.

729
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,030
Is it you want to ask Linglong

730
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,840
to save your grandpa?

731
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,840
If you want help, just tell me.

732
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
Why do you make such a detour?

733
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,630
If I told you directly,

734
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,590
would you help me?

735
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,190
Of course.

736
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,630
You won’t

737
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,710
get anything from me.

738
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,190
Would you help me?

739
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,960
How could you think this way?

740
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,320
In this world,

741
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,440
no one will help others for nothing,

742
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,360
except my grandpa.

743
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,630
The people in Pingting

744
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
are quite different

745
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,110
from those in Fire Tribe.

746
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,230
A letter from Zhaodu.

747
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,280
This is a copy.

748
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,400
The original is kept by Yin Xiao.

749
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,550
Yin Xiao?

750
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,630
By the way,

751
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,440
how’s Yin Xiao’s sister?

752
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,590
She’s at Weisheng Yan’s mansion,

753
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,000
busy preparing for her wedding.

754
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,710
Weisheng Yan is not a good guy.

755
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,000
I boarded on his ship accidentally

756
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,400
and ends like this.

757
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
And it’s him who sent me to Zhu Xi.

758
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,960
How could Yin Zhuang marry him?

759
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,070
How do you know

760
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,280
what kind of people the Yins are?

761
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,000
How much do you know about them?

762
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,630
In Yin Xiao’s letter to Zhaodu,

763
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,880
he didn’t mention
you’re wanted by Zhu Xi.

764
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,070
Didn’t he?

765
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,030
Yes.

766
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,320
Really?

767
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,190
Yes.

768
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,840
That...

769
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,840
That’s good. That’s good.

770
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,480
If he said that,

771
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,000
Linglong will worry about me.

772
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
It’s good he didn’t.

773
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,230
Stupid.

774
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,480
Speaking of Zhu Xi,

775
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,670
you should be his subordinate.

776
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,550
Why?

777
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,630
You are afraid of him?

778
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,840
You are useless to him.

779
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,880
What he wants is your daughter.

780
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,670
After I visited his Pingting city,

781
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,760
I know better what kind of person he is.

782
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,510
So it seems

783
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,280
Linglong had better stay in Zhaodu.

784
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,320
It’s much safer than here.

785
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,760
Right?

786
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,670
If

787
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,510
your daughter is the Goddess,

788
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,840
there is

789
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,150
no safe place for her

790
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,590
in Suchuan.

791
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,150
What on earth is the Goddess?

792
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,030
Goddess

793
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,360
is a tool to help others realize

794
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,400
desires and ambitions.

795
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,920
Why should it be Linglong?

796
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,030
You’re her father.

797
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,710
You should find the answer by yourself.

798
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,150
No.

799
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,150
I have to go to Zhaodu.

800
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,360
You must help me.

801
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,320
It’s bad to send you to Zhaodu.

802
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,630
I’ll go out for a while.

803
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,000
Help me look after my grandpa.

804
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,630
Look,

805
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,880
it’s good

806
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,280
you behave like this.

807
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,710
What?

808
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,230
Ask me for help.

809
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,630
It’s good you say it directly.

810
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,000
It’s what you should do.

811
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,800
I...

812
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,760
Last evening,

813
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,230
who made my grandpa so angry?

814
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,480
When my grandpa wakes up,

815
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,320
just do whatever you can

816
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,030
to please him.

817
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,590
If you can’t make him happy,

818
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,590
you’ll be dead.

819
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,880
Where are you going?

820
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,280
You made a trouble yesterday.

821
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,840
I have to deal with it.

822
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,360
If you believe me,

823
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,710
don’t go to Zhaodu,

824
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,030
because you and your daughter

825
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,840
are the biggest weaknesses
of each other.

826
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:26,800
Our plan

827
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,670
is to send Huotu Xin to Zhaodu,

828
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,920
not hiding him.

829
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,960
If I don’t do something

830
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
to make him believe me,

831
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,230
your plan can’t be finished.

832
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,030
He looks stupid.

833
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,190
Actually,

834
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,440
he’s very clever.

835
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,000
Zhu Xi will go to Zhaodu soon.

836
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,710
What to do?

837
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,480
You have to ask him.

838
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,800
I mean

839
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,630
what do you want me to do in Zhaodu?

840
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,150
I really like talking with you.

841
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,670
Greet your grandpa for me.

842
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,510
My grandpa is getting worse.

843
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,480
It seems this medicine doesn’t work.

844
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,110
So you have to hurry.

845
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,510
Don’t think falsely that

846
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,800
you did something for him,

847
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,360
and he’ll ask his daughter
to cure your grandpa.

848
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,110
The Goddess won’t act

849
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,510
according to the will
of ordinary people.

850
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,190
You let Linglong go,

851
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,480
and then Huotu Xin,

852
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,760
making them gather at Zhaodu.

853
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,280
What do you want to do?

854
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
You needn’t know.

855
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,840
Just remember,

856
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,630
it’s only me who can cure your grandpa.

857
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,190
your grandpa.
