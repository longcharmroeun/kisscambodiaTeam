24
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,240
Girl,

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,000
I am not a monster.

26
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,100
Girl,

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,310
I am not a monster.

28
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,380
Girl,

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,630
don’t be scared.

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,470
I have dispelled all the evil people.

31
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,190
I am not a monster.

32
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,910
Don’t be scared.

33
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,080
Your father

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,280
saved my life.

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,100
Are you Jia’s daughter?

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,780
I am not a monster.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,800
What is your name?

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,800
Don’t kill me.

39
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,630
I am not a monster.

40
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,150
I am not a monster.

41
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,960
I am not…

42
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,870
Don’t kill me.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,360
-Don’t kill me.
-Who is going to kill you?

44
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,840
I… I am not coming to kill you.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,910
I am coming to help you.

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,520
Your father

47
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,280
died to save me

48
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,190
because he believed I could help you

49
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,310
cure your disease.

50
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,150
I am not a disease.

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
Are you hiding

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,120
because you don’t want others
to see how you look?

53
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,150
Girl,

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,870
let me tell you a story.

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,120
Both my wife and daughter can transform.

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,960
They look even weirder than you

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,960
after transformation.

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,780
Look,

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
so I am not afraid of you at all.

60
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,000
Your father said

61
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,240
you started to look like this

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,560
after you got sick 17 years ago.

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,340
Is it true?

64
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,300
No.

65
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,710
It is not a disease.

66
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,870
My father didn’t know.

67
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,680
I am not who I am.

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,120
I am not a disease.

69
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,430
Not a disease?

70
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,560
What is it then?

71
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,590
Girl,

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,080
you…

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,240
Do you know a girl named Jin’er?

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,910
She

75
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,120
may be a little older than you.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,080
Jin’er?

77
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,820
Yes.

78
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,590
She is much prettier than me.

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,030
They all love her.

80
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,310
Who are they?

81
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,870
You know Jin’er?

82
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,400
All love her.

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,720
Do you also love her?

84
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,160
Do you also want to kill me?

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
You also want to kill me!

86
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,480
-I don’t want to kill you.
-Come and kill me!

87
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,510
-I don’t want to kill you.
-Come and kill me!

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,190
I am a monster.

89
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,270
-Come and kill me!
-Girl.

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,750
I... I won’t.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,510
I also want to kill myself.

92
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,390
Calm down.

93
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,630
Put down the knife.

94
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,160
I am not who I am.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,920
I can’t kill myself.

96
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,360
Father.

97
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,040
I want to die.

98
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,070
Girl, calm down.

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,720
Give me the knife.

100
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,000
Come on.

101
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,830
Come on.

102
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,040
Give me the knife.

103
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,390
Do you also want to kill me?

104
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
Come and kill me!

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
Come and kill me!

106
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,830
Come and kill me!

107
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
Kill me.

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,950
Just kill me.

109
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,800
Come and kill me.

110
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,510
Father.

111
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,750
Help me.

112
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,560
Hey, girl.

113
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,800
Do you really know Jin’er?

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Can you tell me

115
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,560
who on earth she is?

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,750
Let me out.

117
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,120
Just kill me.

118
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,630
Come and kill me.

119
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,120
Just kill me.

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,240
Master,

121
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,680
the thing that Marquis Pingjiang wants

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,720
is ready now.

123
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,920
Has he boarded?

124
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,860
Yes.

125
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,000
He chose your fish boat.

126
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,310
One more thing,

127
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,630
Ms. Yin Zhuang visited

128
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,000
all foundries in Pingting today.

129
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,000
What did she do there?

130
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,240
She showed two very ugly crystal stones

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,950
with mediocre textures and asked them

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,070
to make a pair of bracelets

133
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,870
as her dowry.

134
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,040
It happened suddenly

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,510
and no workshop owner dared to

136
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,920
accept her order.

137
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,830
Everybody is waiting outside.

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,720
Please kindly provide your advice.

139
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,270
What kind of crystal stone?

140
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,190
Nobody knows it,

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,680
but they all claim it to be valueless.

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,190
Ms. Yin Zhuang insisted it was

143
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,310
an heirloom of the Yin Family.

144
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,390
Just ask Mr. Liu to take the order

145
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,070
and present it to me.

146
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes.

147
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,310
Ms. Yin Zhuang is really a wise girl.

148
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:57,780
Master.

149
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,620
Master.

150
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,720
What’s up? Why are you in a hurry?

151
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,310
Ms. Yin Zhuang

152
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,980
she…

153
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,630
She visited Wu Yan’s jewelry workshop.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,620
What?

155
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,720
Why did she go there?

156
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,920
None of our foundries

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,630
dared to take her order.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,870
But Tan the shoe repairman

159
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,160
outside Lan’s jewelry workshop

160
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
gave her a hint,

161
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,360
telling her that Wu Yan

162
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,240
was the best jewelry maker in Pingting.

163
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
<i>Bracelet</i>
What a diehard!

164
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,510
<i>Bracelet</i>
I should have killed him

165
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,070
when I took over his workshop then.

166
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,870
Is she alone?

167
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,190
Where is Yin Xiao?

168
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,950
Master,

169
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,680
Yin Xiao is still inquiring about

170
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
the whereabouts of Huotu Xin.

171
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,750
Keep a close eye on him.

172
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,060
Aye.

173
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:40,950
Prepare the carriage.

174
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,160
Marquis Pingjiang is waiting for me.

175
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,190
Heirloom.

176
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,560
Are you treasures
only in the countryside?

177
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,240
In Pingting,

178
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
nobody knows you.

179
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,630
This is your last hope.

180
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Just cheer up.

181
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,680
Anybody here?

182
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Anybody here?

183
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,550
May I know

184
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,510
if it is the workshop of Master Wu Yan?

185
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,240
Yin Zhuang?

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,670
Huotu Xin?

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,790

a smooth

192
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,840
Weisheng Yan,

193
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,030
I haven’t used your fish boat
for some days

194
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,510
and it looks even more magnificent.

195
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,510
You are almost

196
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,510
as majestic as I am.

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
They are all prepared
for Your Highness.

198
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,030
Everything at my home

199
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,870
belongs to Your Highness.

200
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,510
Really?

201
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,550
I thought you had

202
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,080
prepared them for the Yin Family.

203
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
Your Highness
has the highest esteem today

204
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
and your territory

205
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,960
covers half of Suchuan.

206
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,270
The daughter of the Yin family

207
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,200
married to a merchant

208
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,750
miserably,

209
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
and became a civilian.

210
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,480
How can the Yin family
be comparable with Your Highness?

211
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,320
Weisheng Yan,

212
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,720
you have made unknown sacrifices

213
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,390
on your way to becoming
Suchuan’s rich merchant in Pingting.

214
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,790
But I know it well.

215
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,480
So my advice for you is that

216
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,150
focus on your own business,

217
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,840
never indulge yourself in girls

218
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,030
and become lost among them.

219
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,480
None of them is real.

220
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,910
Thanks for your advice, Your Highness.

221
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,000
Where is the thing I want?

222
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,240
I gathered the best jewelry makers

223
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,670
in Pingting to make it the soonest.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,790
There is never a mistake.

225
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,000
What is that?

226
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
Does Your Highness

227
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,870
take any gift on the trip to Zhaodu?

228
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,390
A grand gift.

229
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,900
Master!

230
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,140
Where are you going?

231
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,200
Look for Yin Zhuang.

232
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,320
I am afraid she is in danger.

233
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,620
You…

234
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
How come did you get here?

235
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Is anybody following you?

236
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,360
Are you sure

237
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
you are alone?

238
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,870
I can put my hand away.

239
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,960
But you must promise me

240
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,720
not to yell

241
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,200
and shout.

242
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,000
Dude,

243
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,270
you are dating a girl so soon

244
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,320
after you came here.

245
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,600
You are mistaken, sir.

246
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,240
No.

247
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
We have been looking for him.

248
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,200
Looking for him?

249
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,200
Girl,

250
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:57,910
please.

251
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,360
This way, please.

252
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,030
Please, please.

253
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,840
How did you come here?

254
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,910
Are you really coming for

255
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,870
jewelry making instead of me?

256
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,600
It is said

257
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,630
he is the best jewelry maker
in Pingting.

258
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,910
Are you really not coming for me?

259
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,960
Weisheng Yan doesn’t know I’m here?

260
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,870
It is just a coincidence.

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,550
But my brother did look for you.

262
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,240
He even broke into
the jail of Marquis Pingjiang

263
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,000
If so,

264
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,750
will Marquis let him leave safely?

265
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,870
Weisheng Yan spent a lot.

266
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,240
Then why didn’t your brother

267
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,440
say the same

268
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,480
in his letter addressed to Zhaodu?

269
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,240
He said I was safe and sound here.

270
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,720
It will spare Linglong’s worries

271
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,910
and it is not a mistake.

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,790
-But…
-No.

273
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
In his reply letter to Zhaodu,

274
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
my brother only told the truth.

275
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,390
We lost you

276
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,080
and we all felt sorry.

277
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,480
He even asked His Majesty for a penalty.

278
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,390
Sir,

279
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,480
what she said

280
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,200
is different from
what your granddaughter said.

281
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,240
Who shall I trust then?

282
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,750
Trust her.

283
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,320
Thanks, Sir.

284
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,870
But,

285
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,630
my granddaughter must have

286
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,630
her reasons to do that.

287
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,030
Do you still not trust me now?

288
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,720
I… I do.

289
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,840
Just let go of me then.

290
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,790
I didn’t mean to not trust you.

291
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,270
I just don’t trust Weisheng Yan.

292
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,000
He gave me to Zhu Xi

293
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,790
and cheated you.

294
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,150
It seems

295
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,550
he is really a tricky and cunning guy.

296
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,840
Maybe you have been used by him

297
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,000
without realizing it.

298
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,510
I know.

299
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,030
You know?

300
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,000
You still married him if you knew it?

301
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,000
It is my own business.

302
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,840
Moreover,

303
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,440
all merchants are profiteers.

304
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,620
Girl,

305
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,550
where did you get

306
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,080
the two crystal stones?

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,150
They are our ancestral treasures

308
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,960
passed down through generations.

309
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,320
Originally,

310
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,030
it is

311
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,550
my brother…

312
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,360
You…

313
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,200
You…

314
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,030
Don’t you expect

315
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,240
to

316
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,910
make something out of it?

317
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,030
I want to make a pair of bracelets

318
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,000
as my dowry.

319
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,870
But all the workshops in Pingting

320
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,120
claimed it was valueless.

321
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
But this is all

322
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,320
I can give you.

323
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,080
Those mediocre official craftsmen

324
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,510
know nothing about it

325
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,960
and they are valueless actually.

326
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,600
But I have changed my mind.

327
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:50,870
I don’t like to make anything.

328
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,360
Let’s go back to my brother.

329
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,200
Girl,

330
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,320
why…

331
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,510
Why don’t you change your mind?

332
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,870
What a pity!

333
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,270
You don’t trust me.

334
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,390
Nobody except me

335
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,550
in Suchuan

336
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,670
is qualified to make a jewelry

337
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,480
out of the two crystal stones.

338
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,480
No, I…

339
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,270
No more nonsense!

340
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,320
I won’t return them to you. I…

341
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,080
I can’t tolerate

342
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,960
to see those mediocre craftsmen

343
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,120
spoil them.

344
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,550
They can be invaluable

345
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,390
only in my hand.

346
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,270
Just take it easy, girl.

347
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,080
I will give you

348
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,120
the best dowry

349
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,240
in Suchuan.

350
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,150
Wait for me.

351
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,510
Sir!

352
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,150
No more nonsense.

353
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,750
Sir.

354
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,960
It is not your property anyway.

355
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,390
Stop your nonsense!

356
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,030
Sir.

357
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,120
I have a question for you.

358
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,910
Go ahead.

359
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,080
I visited Jia’s home.

360
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,630
There must be something wrong

361
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,720
with his daughter.

362
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,600
But it is not a disease.

363
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
Do you know anything

364
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,790
about the plague

365
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,080
seventeen years ago?

366
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,200
The plague seventeen years ago

367
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,000
is nothing compared with

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,790
the two stones.

369
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Just forget it.

370
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,510
Are they your stones?

371
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,510
They are not yours.

372
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,590
Are you nuts, old man?

373
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,350
Just return them to the owner.

374
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,000
I am doing it for her good.

375
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
After my work is finished,

376
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,440
she will know it all.

377
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,160
But she didn’t approve it.

378
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Okay, just go away.

379
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,270
Don’t interfere with me.

380
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,310
Girl, get onto the sedan.

381
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,980
Look,

382
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
he seems bewitched

383
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,070
and turns a deaf ear to me

384
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,830
when he looks at the two stones.

385
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,240
Just go and take them back yourself.

386
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,510
A person will forget himself

387
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,590
only when he sees his beloved.

388
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,000
It is for him then.

389
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,920
You changed your mind?

390
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,750
Only someone who knows them

391
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,790
can realize their value.

392
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,960
There are liquors here.

393
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
I couldn’t drink liquors so freely

394
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,160
on Bright Moon Island before.

395
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,240
Weisheng Yan’s people are

396
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,440
everywhere in Pingting.

397
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,270
It is a good place for drinking indeed.

398
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,640
Why are you laughing?

399
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,070
I didn’t expect that

400
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,030
an aristocratic girl

401
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,270
drank liquors this way.

402
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,400
How do you think

403
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,270
an aristocratic girl should drink then?

404
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,350
You are the only one I know.

405
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,550
According to the rules of aristocrats,

406
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,790
I shouldn’t get drunk

407
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,720
even after a whole night’s drinking.

408
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,680
Zhu Xi already set out for Zhaodu

409
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,550
with his people.

410
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,620
Report.

411
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,380
What’s up?

412
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,940
Your Majesty,

413
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,030
everything is clear around Zhaodu.

414
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,480
No ambushing army is there.

415
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,510
Zhu Xi’s entourage was found

416
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,480
some tens of kilometers away,

417
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,680
but they had only
one hundred people or so.

418
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,070
They have arrived,

419
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,480
but no message

420
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,880
has been received from Pingting.

421
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,980
It seems

422
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,720
the previous messages from Pingting

423
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,200
are not reliable.

424
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,720
Zhu Xi has made preparations for it.

425
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,550
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

426
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,480
Whatever trick Zhu Xi may have,

427
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,960
he has just

428
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,510
one hundred people or so.

429
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,310
It is not a big deal.

430
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,200
Yuan Yi,

431
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,110
what happened?

432
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,510
Zhu Xi is coming.

433
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,240
That quick?

434
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,270
But you just arrested

435
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,440
Marquis Shuo yesterday, right?

436
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,750
Fei Tian,

437
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,860
I will

438
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,270
arrange for the defense now.

439
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,510
You look worried.

440
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,920
The one I am going to marry

441
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,270
is the richest person in Suchuan.

442
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,440
Look at what I have

443
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,400
on me.

444
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,110
They are all gifts from him.

445
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,440
He can give my brother a hand

446
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,550
and guarantee a good life for me.

447
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,030
No other man

448
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,030
is a better husband than him for me.

449
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,960
So I must be the happiest girl

450
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,000
in the world.

451
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,830
How can I feel worried then?

452
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,640
What are you doing then?

453
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,680
I am happy.

454
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,480
After the jewelry is finished,

455
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,350
I will offer it

456
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,310
to Weisheng Yan as my dowry.

457
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,920
We are going to get married.

458
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Don’t you feel happy for me?

459
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,110
A happy drink

460
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,310
isn’t taken this way.

461
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,480
Please tell me

462
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
how a happy drink should be taken.

463
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,720
Let me tell you.

464
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,110
A happy drink should be taken

465
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,590
when somebody is talking

466
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,750
and drinking with you.

468
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,960
Greetings, Minister Fei.

469
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,240
You finally thought of me.

470
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,440
What?

471
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,030
Are you going to kill me?

472
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,640
Not the right time.

473
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,680
Do you mean

474
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,880
you have some questions for me?

475
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,830
Whether I kill you or interrogate you,

476
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,400
just be sure

477
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,920
you won’t

478
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,640
suffer less pain.

479
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,750
Tell me,

480
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,640
what on earth does Zhu Xi plan to do?

481
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,310
Isn’t it clear enough

482
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,070
what Marquis Pingjiang wants to do?

483
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,200
He wants to kill Linglong.

484
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Does Zhu Xi believe she is Goddess too?

485
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,550
Does it matter

486
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,720
if he believes or not?

487
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,680
Have you witnessed her power?

488
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,640
I have.

489
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,400
It is an invincible power.

490
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,240
Otherwise,

491
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,400
Fozhuan wouldn’t

492
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,960
have died for her.

493
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,960
What they say
about Minister Fei is true.

494
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,640
You don’t seem to be so ruthless.

495
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,960
Kill me!

496
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Kill me!

497
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,340
<i>Bracelet</i>

498
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,400
Master.

499
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,640
No action.

500
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,590
It seems my worries are in vain.

501
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,830
Zhu Xi doesn’t plan on any action.

502
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,000
Then

503
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,830
Ms. Yin Zhuang is still in there?

504
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,440
I don’t know.

505
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,070
I have never seen you

506
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,790
like this.

507
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,980
Master.

508
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,920
Please remain calm and sober.

509
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,920
I suggest

510
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,480
you go in and have a look.

511
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,350
If I go in now,

512
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,590
my care for her will be too evident.

513
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,030
Master, you are kindhearted.

514
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,310
When a servant girl was lost last time,

515
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,350
you dispatched lots of people

516
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,550
in search of her.

517
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,310
Moreover,

518
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,720
she is your wife-to-be.

519
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,550
Don’t flatter me again.

520
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,350
Or just pack up and go back home.

521
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,680
Yes.

522
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:24,830
Then?

523
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,400
What to do then?

524
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,440
How can I continue

525
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,510
if you laugh that way?

526
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:30,750
Okay,

527
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,070
I won’t laugh any more.

528
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,740
Then,

529
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,830
Linglong was upset

530
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,790
hearing the words of that boy.

531
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,510
She hates to hear

532
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,720
bad words against her mother the most.

533
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,790
Guess what happened

534
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,720
after that?

535
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,830
What happened?

536
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,550
From then on,

537
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,070
she would pour liquors of Fire Tribe

538
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,550
into the fish pond of his family

539
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,790
at daybreak every day,

540
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,920
and his fish

541
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,510
would jump out of the pond crazily.

542
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,160
The boy had to

543
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,070
catch the fish jumping out of the pond

544
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,200
beside the pond every morning

545
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,640
without knowing the reason.

546
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,790
It is so lucky that Linglong

547
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,460
has such a father as you.

548
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:08,790
Tell me

549
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,920
something about your parents.

550
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,310
Just forget them.

551
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,790
It gets dark so early.

552
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,070
Is it time for you to go back now?

553
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,510
Do you plan to escape

554
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,750
from the wedding by hiding here?

555
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,270
How about you?

556
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,550
What are you escaping from
by hiding here?

557
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,580
I…

558
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,110
I am running away from fate

559
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,440
instead of a wedding.

560
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,750
I am not running away from fate here.

561
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,270
I have

562
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,480
very important things to do here.

563
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,060
Really?

564
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,550
I appreciate that.

565
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,880
Just allow me to be free for a night.

566
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,580
Okay.

567
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,000
Will you

568
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,110
escape with me?

569
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:52,820
No.

570
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,830
I mean

571
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,310
you don’t have to face a dilemma

572
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,720
if you don’t like the marriage.

573
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,920
You can choose to be single.

574
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,960
Weisheng Yan

575
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,830
isn’t a good guy anyway.

576
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,750
I don’t mean to be single.

577
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,110
No more pretending.

578
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,510
You don’t know me.

579
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,750
I really don’t understand.

580
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,160
Just think about it.

581
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,920
You are an aristocratic girl

582
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,070
and look so…

583
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,820
What?

584
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,440
I...

585
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,940
mean...

586
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,880
not

587
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,500
bad.

588
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,720
You racked up your mind

589
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,110
just for this word?

590
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,000
I mean

591
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,790
you don’t have to face a dilemma

592
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,590
if you don’t want to marry him.

593
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,590
You are the apple
of your brother’s eye.

594
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,550
If he knows you don’t want to marry,

595
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,030
he won’t allow it.

596
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,200
My brother?

597
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,960
My brother is really a powerful man,

598
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,340
isn’t he?

599
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,110
He can defeat anyone

600
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
in Suchuan

601
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,680
basically within three moves.

602
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,720
So he has always protected me

603
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,110
since my childhood.

604
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,030
But do you know

605
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,640
who can guard his dreams?

606
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,880
Anyone

607
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,270
who can be herself freely

608
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,160
must have someone

609
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,750
to protect her behind her.

610
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,070
I don’t want to always

611
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,960
hide behind my brother.

612
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,880
I hope to stand

613
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,790
in front of him and protect him

614
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,110
as he has done to me.

615
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,440
Must it be realized by marriage?

616
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,400
I can understand your sorrows.

617
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,270
By so doing,

618
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,830
you will not only

619
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,750
marry someone you don’t love,

620
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
but also lose the chance to love

621
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,110
who you really love in the future.

622
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,270
Lose the chance to love who I love?

623
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,680
I have a question for you.

624
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,160
Did you marry

625
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,960
someone who you love?

626
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,880
We didn’t care about it then.

627
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,480
Maybe I was too young to realize it.

628
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,880
Moreover,

629
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,350
there isn’t any girl like Jin’er

630
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,510
at Fire Tribe.

631
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,480
But

632
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,110
she really gave me

633
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
someone whom I love most.

634
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,400
You are lucky

635
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,510
if so.

636
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,310
Not everyone is so lucky

637
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,550
to have such a daughter

638
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,880
as Linglong.

639
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,110
You are an expert in comforting others.

640
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,270
Guard the jail carefully and

641
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,000
prevent intrusion of Zhu Xi’s people.

642
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,220
Aye.

643
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,260
Fei Tian,

644
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,920
I am coming to discuss with you.

645
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,160
Zhu Xi has chased me all the way

646
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,350
from Fire Tribe to Zhaodu.

647
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,640
He came here hurriedly and strangely

648
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
and it must be a well-prepared trip.

649
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,550
I don’t know

650
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,480
the purposes of his trip,

651
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,640
but we must take some actions.

652
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,510
You have come to the wrong place.

653
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,310
If you have a solution,

654
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,880
just talk to His Majesty

655
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,920
and Chief Priest.

656
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:42,920
You are right.

657
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,350
I came to you

658
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,030
because all people in Suchuan

659
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,750
know they will help me.

660
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,000
You said you admired Linglong

661
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,790
as she could

662
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,230
do anything she likes

663
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,150
when I was beside her.

664
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,630
Don’t you hope

665
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,070
to have such a person beside you?

666
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,030
It is not up to me.

667
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,670
I don’t mean

668
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,880
a family member.

669
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,710
Can Weisheng Yan

670
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,110
do this for you?

671
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,630
It is not my duty

672
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
to consider it.

673
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,280
Yin Zhuang…

674
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,920
Do I look

675
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,070
very lousy today?

676
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,190
One certainly looks very lousy

677
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,710
when she pretends to be happy

678
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,510
just for the happiness of others.

679
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,630
I am not the one you said.

680
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
The one who will marry Weisheng Yan

681
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,800
isn’t you either.

682
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,280
It is me

683
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,760
when the sun rises tomorrow.

684
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,320
Master,

685
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,360
how do you feel?

686
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,190
Why am I

687
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,110
so eager to kill someone?

688
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,320
But Marquis Pingjiang allows

689
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
the man from Fire Tribe to survive

690
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,150
as he is useful.

691
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,670
If Master is to blame…

692
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,110
No,

693
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
I have many ways

694
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,280
to deal with him.

695
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,190
I will do it right away.

696
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,230
Do you think

697
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,800
how worried a brother will feel

698
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,360
if his sister stays outside overnight?

699
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,590
I see.

700
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,110
I seem…

701
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,230
I seem to have drunk too much.

702
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,590
Impossible!

703
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,800
You haven’t drunk much.

704
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,060
Hey,

705
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,480
are you OK?

706
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,670
Wake up.

707
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,760
Wake up.

708
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,000
Why did you get drunk so easily.

709
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,780

I really feel

Girl,

769
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,590
do you know

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,710
how miraculous

771
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,920
are the two crystal stones

772
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,320
you gave me?

773
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,190
It doesn’t matter if you don’t know,

774
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,630
because

775
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,840
nobody except me

776
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,070
can release their powers.

777
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,590
Just get straight to the point.

778
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,150
How are they special?

779
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,590
One is Yin and the other is Yang.

780
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,110
Just touch them slightly and

781
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,000
the Yang bracelet
will control water and fire.

782
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,510
Even an ordinary person

783
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,320
can become a great master

784
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,190
after wearing it.

785
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,920
You touched them just now,

786
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,960
but nothing has happened.

787
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,760
Moron.

788
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,030
I haven’t worn it.

789
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,360
A man wears the Yang bracelet

790
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,630
and a woman wears the Yin bracelet.

791
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,440
They will be empowered

792
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,550
only upon a touch.

793
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,030
How about the Yin bracelet?

794
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,360
Isn’t it empowered?

795
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:26,960
No.

796
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,840
It is my dowry.

797
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,840
Why isn’t the Yin bracelet empowered?

798
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,800
Silly girl.

799
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,280
The Yin bracelet can protect you.

800
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,150
So long as you wear it,

801
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,480
when you and your lover

802
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,590
are together,

803
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,920
together,

804
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,000
nobody

805
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,230
can harm you.

806
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,710
Who can harm her?

807
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,550
She is going to marry

808
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,800
someone who is rich

809
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,630
and tricky.

810
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,000
Her brother is a Kungfu master.

811
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,630
Sir, you don’t know her brother.

812
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,220
Her brother…

813
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,480
You have stayed outside overnight.

814
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,260
Your brother…

815
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,480
Sir,

816
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,440
what other powerful treasures

817
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,760
and weapons do you have?

818
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Show them to me now.

819
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,920
Hurry up.
