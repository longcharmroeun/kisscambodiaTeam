<i>The Blessed Girl</i>

23
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,260
<i>Episode 11</i>

24
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,750
What are you thinking about?

25
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,120
I’m thinking

26
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,590
what it’d look like if it’s lighted up.

27
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,680
Before I found you,

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,840
I had imagined that

29
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,960
so many times.

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,630
What about after?

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,870
After?

32
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,080
When it’s lighted up,

33
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,190
posterity will remember
the moment forever.

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,800
Suchuan has gone through
Fall of God for 500 years.

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,470
I will break it.

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,710
After that, Suchuan

37
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,840
will be revived in our hands.

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,910
It sounds you’re so confident.

39
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,800
Aren’t you afraid I can’t do that?

40
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,360
Are you worried?

41
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,310
Surely I do.

42
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,870
Now there’re many mysteries.

43
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,960
All clues are pointing to Chief Priest.

44
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,590
But whatever I do,

45
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,710
I can’t make him talk.

46
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,590
Dukes are coming soon.

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Of course I’m worried.

48
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,680
How about I marry you?

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,080
Are you sick?

50
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,400
How can you say that?

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,680
If I marry you,

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,150
you’ll be the empress of Suchuan.

53
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,750
Whether you can do it or not,

54
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,310
no one dares to give you a hard time.

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,430
In that case,

56
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,360
the officials

57
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,430
don’t have to

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,960
choose ladies for me each year.

59
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you…?

60
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
Are you using me as a shield?

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,750
Goddess and empress.

62
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,630
Isn’t it remarkable?

63
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,840
There may be

64
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,190
no one to object me.

65
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,950
My father.

66
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,070
That is to say,

67
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,040
you agree with me?

68
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,070
I’m leaving.

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,000
This is mine then.

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,270
Why

71
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,160
do you have it?

72
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
The servant girl told me

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,390
you are embroidering a handkerchief
for me.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,430
I’ve waited for a long time,

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,950
but I didn’t see you giving it to me.

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,750
I’m afraid you can’t finish it,

77
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,120
and almost sent some men to help you.

78
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,830
No need.

79
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,160
I’m capable…

80
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,830
Yes, you are.

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,920
Give it to me.

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,870
Your embroidering skills

83
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,190
are good indeed.

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,480
But

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,270
is it you?

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,680
It looks exactly like you.

87
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,630
It’s your Yuan family’s badge.

88
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,190
When I finish,

89
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,040
you’ll know how marvelous it is.

90
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,750
Give it to me.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
I don’t care about how marvelous it is.

92
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,680
What matters is that you gave it to me.

93
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,310
Who said that it’s for you?

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,190
You just robbed it.

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,510
Is it not for me?

96
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,520
Yeah.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,560
Then

98
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,270
are you embroidering my family badge

99
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,190
for yourself?

100
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,120
I…!

101
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,270
Sir, you’re awake.

102
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,000
Great.

103
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,800
Do you feel better?

104
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,190
I prepared porridge

105
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,430
and some dishes for you.

106
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,480
It’s a pity that you can’t drink now.

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,680
What’s wrong?

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,830
Are you still angry with me?

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,000
I’ve apologized to Wu Yuan.

110
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,120
She’s forgiven me.

111
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,120
Leave.

112
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,310
Go.

113
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,720
You can leave.

114
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,310
I can’t.

115
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,480
I promised Wu Yuan
to take good care of you.

116
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,510
I’m sorry for you, too.

117
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,830
I’ve made my apologies to you.

118
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,870
If you still feel angry,

119
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,720
and want to scold me,

120
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,120
you can eat some porridge.

121
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,630
As the old saying goes,

122
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,160
you can scold someone badly only
with your stomach full.

123
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,950
Is it right?

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,560
However,

125
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,510
to be honest,

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,630
it’s

127
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,360
also your granddaughter’s fault.

128
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,000
My granddaughter’s fault?

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,430
What’s her fault?

130
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,120
She saved you and took you in.

131
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,360
What’s her fault?

132
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,720
Do you know she works for Zhu Xi?

133
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,950
Do you know how bad Zhu Xi is?

134
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,390
If you worry about your granddaughter,

135
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,120
you should control her more often.

136
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,190
Pooh!

137
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,750
Do…

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,430
Do you…

139
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,270
Do you know...

140
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,720
Alright. Alright.

141
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,800
what she has been through?

142
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,160
-Easy. Easy.
-Do you know that?

143
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,040
Easy.

144
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,310
Tell me then.

145
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,720
What has she been through?

146
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,160
Forget it. Forget it.

147
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,510
It’s none of your business.

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,310
Tell me.

149
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Is it that

150
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,160
she lost her parents since little?

151
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,160
So did Linglong.

152
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,070
Her mother was gone when she’s born.

153
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Kids like them

154
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,270
are hard to control.

155
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,870
I also spend all my efforts

156
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,000
to raise her up.

157
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,430
When she’s little, she’s also wayward.

158
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,070
But the more she’s like that,

159
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,560
the more we parents need to control her.

160
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,680
Did I

161
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,830
say something that irritates you?

162
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,160
But I was telling the truth.

163
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,750
It’s the parents’ fault

164
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,190
if their kids go wrong.

165
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,720
Alright.

166
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,000
Well.

167
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,000
Let me tell you about

168
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,320
my granddaughter,

169
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,240
Wu Yuan.

170
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,960
Actually she

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,840
is not my biological granddaughter.

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,750
When she’s little,

173
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,630
her parents sold her to others

174
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,600
for ten gold coins.

175
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,750
It’s worth the same as your life.

176
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,030
She was sold to

177
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,550
a brothel.

178
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,750
Do you know what’s a brothel?

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,150
Don’t your Fire Tribe have one?

180
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,320
No.

181
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,840
Here

182
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,080
it has

183
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,790
all forms of torture that

184
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,440
you can imagine.

185
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,440
It’s even much crueler

186
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
than you can imagine.

187
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
But Wu Yuan was tough.

188
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,320
Soon

189
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
a plague broke out in Pingting.

190
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,600
All men in the brothel were dead.

191
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,870
Only she survived.

192
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,870
Just after she got out from dead bodies,

193
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,030
she went to Pingting,

194
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,320
the human purgatory.

195
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,720
The Earth Fire is horrible.

196
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,030
But the evils in people’s hearts

197
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,510
are more horrifying.

198
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,600
In Pingting,

199
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,750
secret deals are around all city.

200
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,150
Sometimes,

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,240
to deceive the public,

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,320
they would hire kids

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,790
to do the most horrible business.

204
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,790
You dare to rob me?

205
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,440
Here!

206
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,000
You want to die?

207
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:40,960
Go!

208
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,440
Go away!

209
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,150
Catch him!

210
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,550
Take the stuff.

211
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,440
Stop!

212
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,480
Go!

213
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,600
Give me my bag!

214
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,000
You’ve met Pingting’s kids.

215
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,630
To survive,

216
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,150
they can do everything.

217
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,960
Even an adult

218
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,550
finds it hard to survive here.

219
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,910
But she made it.

220
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,630
Did she…

221
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,080
Did she kill people

222
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,120
at that little age?

223
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,510
How come

224
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,440
she became your granddaughter?

225
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,320
There was a period that

226
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,670
Weisheng Yan wanted to monopolize

227
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,720
the entire forging industry in Pingting.

228
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,960
Many blacksmiths didn’t agree to join in

229
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,000
and died a violent death.

230
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,840
Though they were so cautious,

231
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,510
you could still

232
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,030
hear men dying.

233
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,600
That day she showed up in my shop

234
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,240
with her sick body,

235
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,550
looking like a mess.

236
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,080
If she were not seriously ill that day,

237
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,840
perhaps

238
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,120
I would have been dead

239
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,240
under her innocent eyes.

240
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,550
You’re awake.

241
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,510
Alright.

242
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,120
Let’s take the medicine.

243
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,030
I’ll go to take a bowl.

244
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,840
What happened later?

245
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,440
After a few days,

246
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,870
she showed up again.

247
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,030
Here.

248
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,150
Take it.

249
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,360
Drink.

250
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,320
It’s bitter in the first sip.

251
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,120
But it will taste better.

252
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,440
Okay.

253
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,480
Look how dirty you are.

254
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,270
Kid.

255
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,550
Wait a minute.

256
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,550
Here.

257
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,080
In that period,

258
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,080
I can see many kids walking around.

259
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,910
But the shop

260
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,000
was quite peaceful.

261
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,910
Weisheng Yan seems to have forgotten me.

262
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,360
And Wu Yuan also seems

263
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,720
to have forgotten me.

264
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,000
Later on,

265
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,390
I saw her hiding in the street corner,

266
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,840
but wasn’t willing to come out.

267
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,840
I brought her back to the shop.

268
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,000
You’ve finished changing?

269
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,790
Let me have a look.

270
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,150
It’s quite fit.

271
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,030
You must be hungry.

272
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,270
I’ll get you something to eat.

273
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,790
After that,

274
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,030
I hadn’t seen her for long.

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,390
But one day,

276
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,270
she appeared

277
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,390
suddenly before me.

278
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,200
Ten gold coins.

279
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,320
Can I buy you?

280
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,910
It turned out that she still remembered

281
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,600
because of ten gold coins, she separated

282
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,320
with her families when she’s little.

283
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,390
She thought that

284
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,390
only if she had ten gold coins,

285
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
can she buy her families back.

286
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,510
She was taking me as her family.

287
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,720
You made up the story, right?

288
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,780
I…

289
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,510
I wish it’s just a story I made up.

290
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,640
But…

291
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,640
But…

292
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,500
For…

293
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,750
For Wu Yuan,

294
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,350
her story

295
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,590
is far less than her experience!

296
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:25,980
Her…

297
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,000
Her experience!

298
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,750
Sir.

299
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,000
I’m sorry.

300
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,110
Sorry.

301
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,480
Sorry.

302
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,820
Lord,

303
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,550
Marquis has been waiting for you.

304
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,820
Please.

305
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,400
Your Highness,

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,030
all are ready.

307
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,110
Well done.

308
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,590
Your Highness,

309
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,880
I always think

310
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,110
he’ll be a trouble.

311
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
He is a trouble indeed.

312
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,350
A big trouble that we send to Zhaodu.

313
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,920
Father.

314
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,960
Greetings to Father.

315
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,830
How’s your lesson going?

316
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,510
I’ve learned to the second volume
of the books on the art of war.

317
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,110
This is the thing that

318
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,720
you asked your mother for.

319
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,350
Thank you, Fath…

320
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,110
Keep it in mind.

321
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,790
A man can strive for what he wants

322
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,920
with blood

323
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,550
but never with tears.

324
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,030
You understand?

325
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
Then I can strive for it with your love.

326
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,960
I have so many children.

327
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,510
But I can’t do anything with him.

328
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,590
He’s smart and talented.

329
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,400
People will surely like him.

330
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,200
The first gift for Zhaodu.

331
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,880
I think they must have received it.

332
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,880
Hope Goddess likes it.

334
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,030
Greetings to Your Majesty.

335
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,550
You may rise.

336
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,030
Thanks, Your Majesty.

337
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,680
I’ve never

338
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,350
seen some of you.

339
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,270
It must be your first time to Zhaodu.

340
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,400
Your Majesty.

341
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,270
My legs have been painful these years.

342
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,310
So I haven’t come to court for long.

343
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,160
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

344
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,350
Marquis De,

345
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,960
a few days ago,

346
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
I saw you were drunk

347
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,640
in Marquis Pingjiang’s banquet.

348
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,640
You insisted on dancing

349
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,070
with a singer.

350
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,640
Why are your legs painful now?

351
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,750
Did you sprain your legs because

352
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
you danced too much that day?

353
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,790
Everyone,

354
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,920
we’re here in Zhaodu

355
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,000
to meet the Goddess, aren’t we?

356
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,750
It’s no need

357
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,960
to use the highfalutin excuses

358
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,200
to fool His Majesty.

359
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
After a long time,

360
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,880
Marquis Shuo’s comments

361
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,480
are still so trenchant.

362
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,590
Forgive me.

363
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,160
Did I say something wrong?

364
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,750
I’ve been living leisurely
and carefreely these years.

365
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,550
I beg Your Majesty’s pardon.

366
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,240
You haven’t come to Zhaodu for long.

367
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,960
It’s common that you forget the rules.

368
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,190
No worry.

369
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,240
You have plenty of time

370
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,750
to learn it slowly.

371
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,240
You may rise.

372
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,880
Thanks, Your Majesty.

373
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,480
It’s Suchuan’s luck

374
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,550
to see you living in peace.

375
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,030
Marquis Shuo.

376
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,030
I remember

377
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,720
you’ve finished the building that you

378
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,440
built for Zhu Xi’s banquets.

379
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,050
Yes.

380
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,570
Your Majesty.

381
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,920
If it’s called Flowers Pavilion,

382
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,920
it sounds so girlish.

383
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,480
How about

384
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,240
changing to Talents Pavilion?

385
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,070
What do you think, Marquis Shuo?

386
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,400
Thanks for the name, Your Majesty.

387
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,110
But

388
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,160
why doesn’t Marquis Pingjiang come?

389
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,160
Though Your Majesty lives in the palace,

390
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,960
you know what happens elsewhere.

391
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,400
I’m so impressed.

392
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,160
As you can know Flowers Pavilion,

393
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,110
the name that I mentioned

394
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,960
only once to servants,

395
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,310
why do you bother asking us

396
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,590
why Marquis Pingjiang doesn’t come?

397
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,790
Marquis Shuo,

398
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,680
don’t be so rude.

399
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,440
His Majesty doesn’t scold me.

400
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,270
What’s your rush?

401
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,030
Speaking of politeness,

402
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,310
I am more thoughtful than you are.

403
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,070
Your Majesty,

404
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,000
I brought a gift to Goddess this time.

405
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,310
What is this?

406
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,270
Goddess comes back

407
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,480
and the world is celebrating it.

408
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,070
However,

409
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,200
Goddess was born

410
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,480
in the body of a guilty girl
of Fire Tribe.

411
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,310
I’m so worrying

412
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,350
that the guilty girl of Fire Tribe

413
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,750
would sully Goddess.

414
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,000
I

415
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,640
spent a lot of money on

416
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,070
the bell that can remove evils
to Goddess.

417
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,160
What did you say?

418
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
What

419
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,480
guilty girl of Fire Tribe?

420
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,110
Marquis Shuo,

421
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,240
stop your nonsense.

422
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,480
What are you talking about?

423
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,000
Your Majesty,

424
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,070
doesn’t Goddess know

425
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,480
her ancestor’s guilt?

426
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,000
It’s in the history.

427
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,750
It’s not worth mentioning.

428
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,550
He can go on.

429
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,070
Goddess

430
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
allows no lies.

431
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,200
Goddess, you don’t know.

432
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
The Earth Fire in Flame Chilling Wall

433
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
was set on by the Fire Tribe’s ancestor

434
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,750
for their selfish desires.

435
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,240
Your tribesmen have been guarding it.

436
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,350
It’s not an honor

437
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,880
but an atonement for the ancestors.

438
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,030
And

439
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,310
the one set on the Earth Fire

440
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,960
was the former emperor of Fire Tribe,

441
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,310
Huotu Ke.

442
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,310
People with the name Huotu

443
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,350
are unforgivable.

444
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,640
Goddess,

445
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,920
as long as you put on my bell,

446
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,480
the guilt the ancestor committed

447
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,960
has nothing to do with you then.

448
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,270
Bring you stuff

449
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,160
and get out of here.

450
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,200
Goddess,

451
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
we are caring about you.

452
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
If you are guilty,

453
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,880
it may affect

454
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,640
your reputation.

455
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,480
There is no such a thing.

456
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,030
Goddess

457
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,160
will not be affected

458
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,030
by this trifle.

459
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,880
If Goddess is

460
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,830
indeed so powerful as the legend says,

461
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,920
today

462
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,440
why don’t you just show us?

463
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

464
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,610
Do you agree?

465
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,460
Yes.

466
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,090
I

467
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,070
will send out my order when I’m back.

468
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,920
The entire city

469
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,400
shall eulogize Goddess’ work

470
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,510
and believe in Goddess.

471
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,030
If anyone

472
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,000
dares to doubt Goddess,

473
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,590
he shall be sentenced to death.

474
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,110
If Goddess blesses anyone

475
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,240
depends on Goddess will.

476
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,920
Even His Majesty

477
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,400
has to pray for that.

478
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,480
How dare you ask Goddess

479
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,750
to prove herself?

480
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,110
Chief Priest is right.

481
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,510
If we want Goddess’ blessing,

482
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,590
we must pray sincerely.

483
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,310
I

484
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,680
pray for Goddess’ blessing.

485
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,590
I pray for Goddess’ blessing.

486
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,790
I pray for Goddess’ blessing.

487
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,400
Your blessing will be brought
back to our vassal states

488
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,480
and spread to all.

489
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,400
Enough!

490
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,510
You talk sheer nonsense,

491
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,550
offend your superiors,

492
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,640
incite others

493
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,790
and slander Goddess.

494
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,070
With any of them,

495
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,480
I can order to kill you.

496
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,260
Someone!

497
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,440
Take him away!

498
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,640
Your Majesty,

499
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,750
Marquis Shuo behaves impolitely,

500
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,680
but it’s not such a big crime.

501
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,420
Please

502
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,960
reconsider it, Your Majesty.

503
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,350
Please reconsider it!

504
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,770
So,

505
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,160
you all think

506
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,110
offending Goddess

507
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,790
and damaging her reputation

508
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,000
are not such a big crime?

509
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,030
Take them all away then!

510
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,240
Keep a close watch on them!

511
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,000
Without my orders,

512
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,720
no one can step out of Zhaodu.

513
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,720
Your Majesty,

514
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,960
we are here to pay our respects.

515
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,070
All know it.

516
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,160
If we can’t go back,

517
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,110
who dares

518
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,750
to come to Zhaodu again?

519
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,350
Can’t go back?

520
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,880
It’s you

521
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,160
who worship Goddess so much

522
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,590
after seeing her.

523
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,920
You’re willing to pray in Tianqi.

524
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,110
I won’t kill you.

525
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
The Fall of God will be ended soon.

526
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,830
Goddess is coming back.

527
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,000
This is just the beginning.

528
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,440
I will save you

529
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,750
to see the light in Ritual of Eternity.

530
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,920
But if you

531
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,030
dare to offend Goddess again,

532
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,680
I can’t protect you more

533
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,240
if Goddess punishes you.

534
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,880
Take them away!

535
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,200
Um…

536
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,510
Linglong!

537
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,160
Keep a close watch on Tianqi.

538
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,720
If someone steps out of the court,

539
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,880
kill him!

540
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,870
Fire Tribe.

541
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,200
Where are the books of Fire Tribe?

542
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,110
Fire Tribe.

543
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,400
Fire Tribe.

544
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,750
Fire Tribe.

545
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,070
Fire…

546
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,750
Fire Tribe.

547
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,440
Were they lying to me?

548
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,880
Were they making it up to question me?

549
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,510
Weren’t they?

550
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,270
You said you will not lie to me.

551
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,490
Linglong.

552
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,350
Answer me!

553
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,000
Don’t just call my name!

554
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,680
Where are the books of Fire Tribe?

555
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,510
Calm down.

556
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,620
Give it to me.

557
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,550
You look

558
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
just like what they want you to look.

559
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,000
Jinshi City used to be

560
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,750
the most prosperous place in Suchuan.

561
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,440
It’s the Fire Tribe’s ancestors’ credit.

562
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,720
Yeah.

563
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,820
No one

564
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,590
can be good at mining
and quenching skills

565
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,790
as your ancestors did.

566
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,350
The Founding Father Huotu Ke
was born for it.

567
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,720
So many people gave all out

568
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,240
only for getting a stone he quenched.

569
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,350
Under his leading,

570
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,310
Jinshi City had attracted
numerous people.

571
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,790
He’s the first man
with his name written on Glory Rock.

572
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,830
But obsession

573
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,240
is the root of disasters.

574
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,270
To quench the legendary stone of life,

575
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,920
Spirit Combing Stone,

576
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,200
Huotu Ke made a reckless move.

577
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,960
He mined in the deep center
of the earth,

578
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,200
and used Earth Fire’s power.

579
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,110
And Earth Fire

580
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,440
destroyed everything.

581
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,340
No.

582
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,510
Not everything.

583
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,720
It destroyed

584
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,400
the civilization that Huotu Ke built,

585
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,960
not Huotu Ke himself.

586
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,790
Before him,

587
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,350
Suchuan had never had

588
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,550
such a prosperous Jinshi City.

589
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
After him,

590
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,480
no one was able to build

591
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,790
such a remarkable Flame Chilling Wall.

592
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,160
But my surname is Huotu.

593
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,590
If Huotu Ke is guilty,

594
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,200
how come my father doesn’t know?

595
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,960
My tribesmen have been guarding

596
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,720
the Wall for generations.

597
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,440
How come they don’t know?

598
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,880
When the Wall locked the Earth Fire,

599
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,510
Huotu Ke alone

600
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,030
went to Zhaodu to ask for punishment.

601
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,270
He was willing to take the blame

602
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,240
and accept curses in all ages,

603
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,000
but only asked for hiding the truth

604
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,550
so that the decedents of Fire Tribe

605
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,200
can safeguard the glory
of protecting the Flame Chilling Wall.

606
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,400
The Earth Fire

607
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,750
was just Huotu Ke’s guilt.

608
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,270
But it’s the entire Fire Tribe’s glory.

609
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,150
That day,

610
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,030
in the study,

611
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,510
you asked if I have anything to ask you.

612
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,150
Were you trying to tell me

613
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,670
about the Earth Fire Judgement?

614
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,550
So

615
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,920
this is the origin of Earth Fire.

616
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,760
Indeed.

617
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,480
It’s none of my business.

618
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,110
It’s someone else’s fault.

619
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,710
What does it have to do with me?

620
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,840
If my father is here,

621
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
he must say so.

622
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,880
When I was little,

623
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,110
Mountain Team came to him one day.

624
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,880
They wanted to put out
a center of the fire.

625
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,030
But they were short-handed.

626
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,590
Since I was born,

627
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,070
my father stepped away
from the Earth Fire

628
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,960
as far as he can.

629
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,760
My father didn’t agree

630
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,320
and said their fire map was wrong.

631
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,550
He persuaded them not to go.

632
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
In that mission,

633
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,800
two tribesmen were dead.

634
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,670
The Earth Fire got
a small hill collapsed.

635
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,280
The bodies were not found.

636
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,150
Their fire map was really wrong.

637
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,710
But the tribesmen scolded and sneered

638
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,280
my father for his selfishness
and weakness.

639
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,230
I can still remember

640
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,400
that day the sun was big,

641
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
and it was so hot.

642
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,030
The women who tried to get into my home

643
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,190
were wearing sweat or tears.

644
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,030
My father was standing at the door.

645
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,800
I felt he’s extraordinarily tall.

646
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,400
His cries were like

647
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,280
falling from the sky.

648
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,230
Alright!

649
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,840
None of my business!

650
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,760
It’s not my fault.

651
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,760
What does it have to do with me?

652
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,630
Huotu Xin.

653
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,070
Save them, please.

654
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,150
-Please save them.
-Huotu Xin.

655
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,110
After that,

656
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,320
my father left me with three-day food

657
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,280
and went out with his Fire Spear.

658
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,710
Three days later at night,

659
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,070
my father brought the two bodies

660
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,800
back to the village.

661
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,190
Huotu Xin.

662
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,360
My father said

663
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,760
they had promised to each other.

664
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,000
If whoever died in the Wall,

665
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,710
the one alive

666
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,230
should bring their bodies back.

667
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,840
He also said...

668
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,480
What they did has nothing to do with me.

669
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,710
But what I said

670
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
was real.

671
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,670
Those might be the most heroic words

672
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,000
I’ve ever heard.

673
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,760
My ambition

674
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,190
is to put out the Earth Fire.

675
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,360
As to who set on it,

676
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,960
it has nothing to do with me.

677
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,230
You’re indeed Huotu Xin’s daughter.

678
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,550
Yeah.

679
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,440
Huotu Xin’s daughter

680
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,920
will not be scared away

681
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
by their words.

682
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,280
Sir.

683
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,670
The stone monkey outside the third
gate tower in the southern city.

684
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,440
Do you know it?

685
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,070
Do you know how to get there?

686
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,190
What?

687
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,070
You want to go out?

688
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,880
Wu Yuan said you can’t go out.

689
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,480
A man was killed

690
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,400
by Zhu Xi

691
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,320
because of saving me.

692
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,280
His daughter is seriously ill.

693
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,440
I need to go to visit her.

694
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,030
A little girl in Pingting

695
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,710
fooled you easily.

696
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,360
Did you forget?

697
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,590
Actually Pingting is not that horrible.

698
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,280
Those people that I’ve met in the way,

699
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,280
no matter they’ve helped me or hurt me,

700
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,360
like

701
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,230
Wu Yuan,

702
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,920
you,

703
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,000
and Jia,

704
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,710
or even the little girl

705
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,840
who used me to get reward money,

706
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,070
and no matter they’re good or evil,

707
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,280
all are doing it

708
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,800
for the person they love.

709
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,190
When we were in the Fire Tribe,

710
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,840
they said Linglong and Jin’er
were monsters.

711
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,440
And now we came to Zhaodu.

712
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,480
Linglong was worshiped as Goddess

713
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,400
and became the hope of Suchuan.

714
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,360
Sometimes,

715
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,110
is it so distinct from good and evil?

716
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,360
You all told me

717
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,550
not to trust anyone in Pingting.

718
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,150
But I think

719
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:20,620
people

720
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,590
are trusting me here.

721
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,550
Sir.

722
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,840
If Linglong can cure your disease,

723
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,280
I will definitely help you.

724
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:30,670
I’m not sick.

725
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,150
You’re the one who’s sick.

726
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,640
Fine.

727
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,590
I am.

728
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,880
Then I’m leaving.

729
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,550
Wait.

730
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,510
I’ve told you so much.

731
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,070
Do you still want to stop me?

732
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,110
The stone monkey outside the third
gate tower in southern city.

733
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,190
Do you know how to get there?

734
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:02,630
Xiao.

735
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,840
What’re you doing?

736
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,880
Here you are.

737
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:09,940
No.

738
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,190
This treasure has been passed by

739
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,840
for generations in the Yin family.

740
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,000
It is

741
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,920
only passed to the eldest legal son.

742
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,510
It’s for you
and my future sister-in-law.

743
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,360
When I was little,

744
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,760
Father didn’t even allow me
to have a look.

745
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,670
What do you give me for?

746
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,480
As a dowry.

747
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,190
I don’t really need it.

748
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,840
Look at all the rare treasures

749
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,550
in Weisheng’s family.

750
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,230
Weisheng Yan

751
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,840
also gave me many of them.

752
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,760
In recent days,

753
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,360
what I put on

754
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,000
and wear

755
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,150
almost weighs me down.

756
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,150
Even if I change
three different clothes a day,

757
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,510
I figure that

758
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,670
I can’t try all of them in my life.

759
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,550
But this is all

760
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,710
I can give you.

761
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,090
Alright.

762
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,440
This is our ancestors’

763
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,280
blessing.

764
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,360
It can protect the Yins

765
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,590
for generations and generations.

766
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,840
I heard from Mother that

767
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,630
there is a pair

768
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,110
of Guardian Stones

769
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,440
to bless lovers

770
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,030
for a lifelong

771
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,630
companionship.

772
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,790
Now

773
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,400
it’s passed to you.

774
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,000
But Xiao,

775
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,230
you are wrong.

776
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,070
This is not what you can only give me.

777
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,840
You are the guardian of my life.

778
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,190
Silly girl.

779
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,440
Open it.

780
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
Xiao, did you take it wrong?

781
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,320
No way.

782
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,070
I’ve never seen it before.

783
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,920
But

784
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,960
if they’re the family heirloom,

785
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,630
it would be so ugly.

786
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,520
Yin Zhuang,

787
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,510
these are the heirloom.

788
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,480
I see.

789
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,390
Get out!

790
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,010
Who are you?

791
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,070
Let go of me!

792
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:49,840
Father!

793
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,920
What are you scared of?

794
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,360
Let go of me!

795
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,230
Your father will not come back.

796
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,710
From now on,

797
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,630
you’ll be all alone.

798
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,960
Who can take care of you?

799
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,550
I

800
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,230
will take you to a wonderful place.

801
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,360
The men there

802
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,480
will love you much more.

803
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,320
No!

804
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,880
No!

805
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:06,710
Let go of me!

806
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,800
This is for you.

807
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,000
The men there

808
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,360
will give you more money.

809
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,510
I’m trying to be nice to you.

810
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:14,670
I told you.

811
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:15,880
Your father’s head has been

812
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,510
hanging on the city wall for days.

813
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,880
No one in Pingting dares to
care about your life.

814
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,070
Why does she look like this?

815
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,400
With this horrible face,

816
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,960
who will pay for her?

817
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,590
No wonder Jia had hidden her for years.

818
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,440
Jia’s daughter

819
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,400
was so beautiful before.

820
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,920
Why would she turn into this look?

821
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:39,760
Only if she can give birth,

822
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,000
people will buy her.

823
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,880
This look…

824
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,390
Go away.

825
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,400
I dropped this.

826
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,030
Give me that.

827
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,400
I heard that

828
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,630
you’re going to sell her to a brothel?

829
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,920
What brothel?

830
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,760
It’s Fuyan House.

831
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,710
You must have gone there.

832
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,230
Never.

833
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,710
That makes sense.

834
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,800
If a handsome man like you

835
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,320
ever came,

836
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,760
I will definitely remember.

837
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,280
What?

838
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,800
You’re interested in the girl?

839
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,030
Let me told you.

840
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,510
She’s still a

841
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,190
virgin…

842
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,280
You bastard.

843
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,710
You dare to take our Fuyan House’s girl?

844
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,360
Beat him to death!

845
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,060
Where’s the money?

846
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,590
No spitting!

847
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,360
Get away!

848
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,960
Damn it.

849
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,670
What the heck is it?

850
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,590
Stop talking.

851
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,510
Her father has gone.

852
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,710
She will be ours sooner or later.

853
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,280
We can sell her to a demote place

854
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,360
and still benefit from it.

855
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,800
Who are you?

856
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,280
What do you want?

857
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,480
Are you a team with the man?

858
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,320
He?

859
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,550
How can I be a team with him?

860
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,150
He’s such a busybody.

861
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,280
How come

862
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,590
there is such a busybody

863
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,760
in Pingting?

864
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,440
You’ve never known that, right?

865
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,280
Me neither.

866
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,320
Whoever sells women

867
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,440
shall die.
