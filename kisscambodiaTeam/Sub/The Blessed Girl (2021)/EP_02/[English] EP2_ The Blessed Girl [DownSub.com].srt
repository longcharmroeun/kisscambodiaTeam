00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,300
(A few months ago
Zhaodu, the capital)

24
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,710
All good.

25
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,280
Summon Fei Tian.

26
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,030
Your Majesty.

27
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,630
Did you activate the Calculator again?

28
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
I’m ready

29
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,190
to receive the nobility

30
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,840
coming to the capital to pay respects.

31
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,400
They’ve left.

32
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,360
Left?

33
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,030
I asked them to leave

34
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,120
to protect Your Majesty.

35
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,360
I’m old enough

36
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,750
to deal with them.

37
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,560
Your Majesty, do you remember

38
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,310
when was the last time

39
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,240
they came

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,510
to pay respects to you?

41
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,240
When was that?

42
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,190
I barely

43
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,160
remember their looks.

44
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,680
Why did they flood in

45
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,000
all of a sudden?

46
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,360
They came to check

47
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,830
if I could still keep the throne.

48
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,190
What are you going to do?

49
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,310
They’ll see

50
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,560
I carry the Yuan’s bloodline.

51
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,680
I am the chosen one.

52
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,120
No one can replace me.

53
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,560
Your Majesty,

54
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,310
are you

55
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,680
going to play tricks on them

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,390
with the Calculator?

57
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,870
Tricks?

58
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,680
It’s Immortals’ legacy!

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
You said it yourself

60
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,160
it’s a legacy.

61
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,680
God’s gone for 100 years

62
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,560
without any trace.

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,000
Back in the ancient Suchuan,

64
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,430
God

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,390
only existed in stories.

66
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,000
Your Majesty,

67
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,000
a state’s prosperity

68
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,120
lies in humans

69
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,240
instead of Gods.

70
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,600
It’s true!

71
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,040
Our ancestor and God

72
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
used to fight side by side

73
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,040
to seal the Evil Soul underground

74
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,270
and bring peace and unification

75
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,000
to this once

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
uncivilized and blood-stained land.

77
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,750
They drove out

78
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,750
enemies over and over.

79
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,870
Because of them,

80
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,680
Suchuan has been in peace

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,560
for a thousand years.

82
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
That’s all the more reasons for you

83
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,040
to work harder as the emperor

84
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,830
to not lose your state

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,430
to others.

86
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,430
Work harder?

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,680
The nobility has risen to power

88
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,190
over the last hundred years.

89
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,480
My decrees couldn’t
even get out of the capital.

90
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,070
Right now, what Suchuan needs

91
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,430
isn’t a diligent

92
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,800
but weak emperor

93
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,390
but the one blessed by God.

94
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,190
You’re the last descendant

95
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,270
of the Yuans.

96
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,750
I, Fei Tian,

97
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,040
and the Moon Tribe

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,680
will safeguard you and Zhaodu

99
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,680
as long as we can breathe.

100
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
Good day, Your Majesty.

101
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,560
You don’t believe in God?

102
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
He’s not here

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,040
at the moment!

104
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,120
It’s true that Goddess

105
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,920
has never left.

106
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,040
They’re back.

107
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,830
What happened?

108
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,510
Don’t know.

109
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,270
What’s wrong? Is she alright?

110
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,120
Is something wrong?

111
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,800
No idea.

112
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,680
Go get the physician.

113
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,630
No need.

114
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,720
Look, they’re back.

115
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,800
Don’t say a word to Linglong

116
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
about what happened earlier.

117
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:50,830
Leader,

118
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,160
is that monster

119
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,160
the Fire Demon?

120
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
Shut your mouth!

121
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,270
Would you still be on your feet

122
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,870
if it was a monster?

123
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,390
Chi Fang,

124
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,390
go with him.

125
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

126
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,070
Take this.

127
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,430
Leader,

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,920
what about him?

129
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,630
Sweetie,

130
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,670
don’t scare me.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,840
I promised your mother

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,030
that I’d take good care of you.

133
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,550
You...

134
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,670
Huotu Xin,

135
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,080
open up.

136
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,670
You aren’t alone.

137
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,630
We’re here to help.

138
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Open the door,

139
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,320
Huotu Xin!

140
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,720
What?

141
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,600
How’s Linglong?

142
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,200
She’s fine.

143
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,550
About that thing...

144
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,440
What thing?

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,360
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,790
Linglong needs to rest.

147
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,720
Leave her alone.

148
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,360
Huotu Xin!

149
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,510
Huotu Xin!

150
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,120
Hey,

151
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,960
who are you?

152
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,270
You...

153
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,360
You aren’t a member of our tribe, right?

154
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,840
I’ve got lost.

155
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,390
Miss,

156
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,960
where are you from?

157
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,630
Pingting.

158
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,550
Pingting?

159
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,510
Linglong!

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,720
Father.

161
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,910
How do you feel?

162
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,670
I think

163
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,670
I had a dream,

164
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,120
a bad one.

165
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,630
In the dream,

166
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,870
I hurt you.

167
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Silly girl.

168
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,150
Look at me.

169
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,270
I’m strong as an ox.

170
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,550
It was

171
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,120
like a dream,

172
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
but

173
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,910
too real to be one.

174
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,870
I’m sorry, Jin’er.

175
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,600
I wasn’t there with you

176
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,480
when Linglong was born.

177
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,240
Huotu Xin!

178
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,670
There you are!

179
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,390
Your wife is giving birth.

180
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,320
She’s in labor. Go home quickly!

181
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,270
Hurry up, Huotu Xin!

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The midwife is already there.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,790
Run faster!

184
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,200
Why are you leaving?

185
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,000
Monster!

186
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,550
You have a monster at home!

187
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,000
Why must we go there?

188
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,510
The Earth Fire

189
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,440
behind the Flame Chilling Wall

190
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
can kill people.

191
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,080
Besides,

192
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,790
outsiders

193
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,150
aren’t allowed to be there.

194
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,390
Ancestors made that rule

195
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,390
when the Wall was built.

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
No one has ever broken it.

197
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,320
You’ve already broken the rule once

198
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,550
by marrying me, right?

199
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,630
They aren’t the same things.

200
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,320
Jin’er,

201
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,320
why do you

202
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,600
insist on going there?

203
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,080
You can tell me.

204
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,480
I’ll explain it to others.

205
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,150
Don’t worry.

206
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,240
I’ll let you know

207
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,200
when we get to the Palace of Flames.

208
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,720
No entry is allowed there.

209
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,670
It’s a deathtrap inside.

210
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,960
Why must we take such a risk

211
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,390
with our baby?

212
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,240
It’s for me

213
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,630
and her.

214
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,320
Trust me.

215
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,200
I’ll tell you everything there.

216
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,320
Let’s go.

217
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,200
Be careful.

218
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,080
Jin’er,

219
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,630
the entrance is right ahead.

220
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
We must be more careful.

221
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,440
This way.

222
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,910
Slowly.

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,670
Be careful!

224
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,600
My baby!

225
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,000
My baby!

226
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,270
No!

227
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,480
No!

228
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,790
This is for her.

229
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,870
She’s going to need it someday.

230
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,240
Jin’er!

231
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,910
Jin’er!

232
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,600
Jin’er!

233
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,240
Jin’er!

234
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,110
You are...

235
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,200
This is for her.

236
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,510
She’s going to need it someday.

237
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,550
You knew what would happen,

238
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,880
didn’t you?

239
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,160
Come on.

240
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,550
I know you’re awake.

241
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,310
Stop pretending.

242
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,480
Finish this bowl of noodles first.

243
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,510
You do this every time
when you’re in trouble.

244
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,350
Aren’t you hungry?

245
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,200
Doesn’t it smell good?

246
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,720
Do you want it?

247
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,830
You can’t hold it.

248
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,440
Father.

249
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,920
Go on.

250
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,400
Why did you stop?

251
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,550
Go back to sleep.

252
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,880
Father,

253
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,960
you won’t punish me

254
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
while I’m still weak, will you?

255
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,680
Fill yourself up.

256
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,240
Once you’re done,

257
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,880
think carefully

258
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,510
about what you should say to me.

259
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,030
Isn’t this mother’s necklace?

260
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,310
Eat up.

261
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,310
Who are you?

262
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,310
What are you doing over there?

263
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,550
All done.

264
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,590
Bring it on.

265
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
I’m at your disposal.

266
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,270
Your chin almost touches the floor.

267
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,920
You can’t even look at me?

268
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,480
Look up.

269
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,920
What were you thinking?

270
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,240
You almost made my heart stop.

271
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,030
Thank goodness, you’re safe.

272
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,070
This necklace

273
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,750
had been with your mother

274
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,030
the whole time

275
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,750
until she left it to you

276
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,440
before she passed away.

277
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,720
You didn’t get to see her inside,

278
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,960
but her necklace

279
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,550
will protect you instead.

280
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,640
I knew

281
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,510
-you wouldn’t punish me.
-Oh, stop it.

282
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,110
Knock it off.

283
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,790
Just save it.

284
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,480
You do this every time.

285
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,550
So do you, right?

286
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,240
What about me?

287
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,790
Seriously, are you not going to tell me

288
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,240
about last night?

289
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,030
Are you

290
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,880
avoiding it again

291
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,510
just like how you avoid
what happened to mother?

292
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,550
Are you going to

293
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,310
keep that to yourself forever

294
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,350
without telling anyone?

295
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,200
Linglong!

296
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,960
you’re still young.

297
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,310
I’m not, father.

298
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,750
I can tell

299
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,440
the strange glance

300
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,640
they shot at me

301
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,510
as if

302
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,400
I were

303
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,270
a public enemy

304
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,920
without knowing it.

305
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,920
Linglong...

306
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,720
The longer you keep me in the dark,

307
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,640
the more I’m eager to know the truth

308
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,510
and put myself in grave danger.

309
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,640
Would you rather

310
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,480
see me risk my life

311
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,240
and get injured again?

312
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,510
Of course not.

313
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,640
Then tell me

314
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,920
what happened last night

315
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,200
after I got burned

316
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,680
by the Earth Fire.

317
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,590
How come there isn’t even a scratch

318
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,110
on me?

319
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,830
Are you sure

320
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,160
you don’t remember anything?

321
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,550
Yes.

322
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,720
I might have

323
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,960
seen a boy.

324
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,440
Who is he?

325
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,110
You

326
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,200
don’t know him?

327
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,000
Good. Great.

328
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,510
I was about to

329
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,440
ask you about your relationship.

330
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,680
So he’s a stranger to you.

331
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,550
That’s a relief.

332
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,880
I was worrying for nothing.

333
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,160
Your Majesty.

334
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,830
Chief Priest,

335
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,000
were God here,

336
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,960
would the Pillar of Eternity shine?

337
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,830
In ancient times,

338
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,400
every year at the Ritual of Eternity,

339
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,590
God

340
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,960
would follow Heavenly Immortals’ will

341
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,350
and spread out

342
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,590
their grace through the Pillar.

343
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,070
Then

344
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,200
it would shoot its light up to the sky.

345
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,200
Pillars all over Suchuan

346
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,790
would resonate with it

347
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,310
and bestow such light

348
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,160
on every corner of the land.

349
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,160
At that time,

350
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,070
the sky

351
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,720
became incredibly magnificent.

352
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,720
Would Immortals

353
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,590
receive my prayers?

354
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,750
How come God no longer descends

355
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,550
to guard the Yuans?

356
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,240
The Yuans are the royals
of the Immortal Blood.

357
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,720
Your reign

358
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,510
is the proof of God’s existence.

359
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,720
Royals of the Immortal Blood?

360
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,550
Maybe

361
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,750
God is expecting

362
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,830
a great emperor.

363
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,270
Your Majesty,

364
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,270
16 years ago,

365
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,480
one Pillar of Eternity somewhere

366
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,160
did shine.

367
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,000
Really?

368
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,830
Scouts didn’t return

369
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,830
with any information,

370
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,200
but I believe

371
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,310
that was

372
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,640
God’s message to us.

373
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,440
I’ll find you!

374
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,750
So,

375
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,440
who are you?

376
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,550
What do you know?

377
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,550
How’s

378
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,160
that girl?

379
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,400
You know Linglong?

380
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,270
Yes.

381
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,270
We’ve known each other

382
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,030
since ancient times.

383
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,550
Utter nonsense!

384
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,070
You...

385
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,160
Be specific.

386
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,400
You mean that monster

387
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,000
or Linglong?

388
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,310
Monster?

389
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,270
It’s understandable

390
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,830
that you don’t recognize her.

391
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,440
Goddess has been away

392
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,350
from you for so long

393
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,070
that you no longer remember her.

394
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,590
Are you saying

395
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,030
that monster

396
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,160
is Linglong?

397
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,030
If Huotu Xin

398
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,110
hears that baloney,

399
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,240
he’d whack him for sure!

400
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,240
Chi Fang,

401
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,720
what do you think?

402
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,270
It’s kind of ridiculous.

403
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,240
But given what happened back then...

404
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,000
Haven’t Huotu Xin

405
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,680
done enough ridiculous things?

406
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,160
I guess

407
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,720
only he

408
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,400
can tell us the truth.

409
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,160
This time,

410
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,110
he can’t get away from it.

411
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,270
He didn’t say it 16 years ago.

412
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,750
Would he

413
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,110
do it now?

414
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,680
Look,

415
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,590
we can’t keep him here.

416
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,160
I agree.

417
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,400
Leader!

418
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,400
Leader!

419
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,310
Calm down.

420
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,200
Tell me everything bit by bit.

421
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,960
Shizi...

422
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,590
He... He’s dead.

423
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,790
Linglong.

424
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,160
Linglong.

425
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,200
Xin.

426
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,920
Is Linglong alright?

427
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,070
She’s fine.

428
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,750
That’s good.

429
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:02,720
Come with me.

430
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,790
Did you see them

431
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,550
bringing back

432
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,110
an outsider?

433
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,960
I didn’t.

434
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,680
But my father said

435
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,110
there was a stranger in the dungeon.

436
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,110
Tanmiao,

437
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,640
could you do me a small favor?

438
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,480
No problem.

439
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,880
I need to

440
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
ask that stranger a few questions.

441
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,680
Could you distract
your father for a while?

442
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,350
It’s all for Linglong.

443
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,920
Fine.

444
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,550
Are you expecting questions from me?

445
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,070
Don’t you have any?

446
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,750
Kids these days

447
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,920
are so cunning!

448
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,510
My daughter wants to know

449
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,680
who you are,

450
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,110
but I

451
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,590
have no interest in that,

452
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,880
let alone

453
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,000
what you’re up to

454
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,160
or what you know.

455
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,400
On the contrary,

456
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,880
people with such information

457
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,510
should disappear for good.

458
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,880
I don’t want anyone

459
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,070
to know about that.

460
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,920
What are you doing?

461
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,720
Hold on.

462
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,000
You saved my daughter,

463
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,400
so I owe you one.

464
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,480
But our Leader

465
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,790
doesn’t think so.

466
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,640
I know him well.

467
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,720
It’s just a matter of time

468
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,680
before you’re burned to death.

469
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,590
Follow me

470
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,550
if you want to live.

471
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,720
Wait.

472
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,480
Hang on.

473
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,070
This is it.

474
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,550
Go back to where you belong.

475
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,160
Don’t you want to know the truth?

476
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,030
Didn’t you

477
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,720
call Linglong Goddess?

478
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,400
Do you know what that means?

479
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,200
All I know is she’s my daughter.

480
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,350
She has nothing to do with other things.

481
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,070
Listen,

482
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,750
keep your mouth shut.

483
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,960
Or I won’t be easy on you.

484
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,440
You don’t need to tell me that.

485
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,960
I’ll leave

486
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,550
only if you join me.

487
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,550
Join you?

488
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,830
On what ground?

489
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,920
I saved you

490
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,510
and Linglong.

491
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,110
If she transforms herself again,

492
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,160
only I can protect her in Suchuan.

493
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,790
Your tribesmen

494
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,310
have known

495
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,030
that she’s that monster.

496
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Do you think your Leader

497
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,030
will allow you to stay here any longer?

498
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,680
You told them?

499
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,680
It’s the first time in 500 years

500
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,440
that God has descended to Suchuan again

501
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,200
in your daughter’s body.

502
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,070
Nothing is better than that.

503
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,960
Whatever happens

504
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,830
to my daughter

505
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,350
stays in my family.

506
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,480
You’d better leave.

507
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,270
Don’t ever come back again.

508
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,070
Understand?

509
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,030
She should go with me.

510
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,880
She doesn’t belong here.

511
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,030
She doesn’t belong to you alone.

512
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:55,960
Brat,

513
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,590
I’m warning you

514
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,720
that if you harass Linglong again,

515
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,640
I’ll burn your whole family to ashes!

516
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,720
Not before you know who I am first.

517
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,630
As a Fire Tribesman,

518
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,110
you’ve never

519
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,030
gone out yourself or with Linglong

520
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,110
in your entire life, right?

521
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,670
Yes. So what?

522
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,440
Please hear me out.

523
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,590
You think

524
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,800
by living in seclusion in the mountains

525
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,840
with your tribesmen,

526
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,800
Linglong can live a peaceful life

527
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,800
despite all those secrets about her?

528
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,280
Last night,

529
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,400
the Pillar of Eternity
outside the Palace of Flames was lit up.

530
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,920
You saw that, didn’t you?

531
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,840
It already

532
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,030
happened once

533
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,030
16 years ago

534
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,880
when Linglong

535
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,630
was born, right?

536
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,070
You’ve tried so hard

537
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,110
to bury that.

538
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,360
Zhaodu took that one

539
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
as a mistake

540
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,110
but that very Pillar of Eternity

541
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,800
has shone again.

542
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,030
How long can you keep that secret?

543
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,550
Pillar of Eternity.

544
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,110
What is that?

545
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,760
What’s that ray of light
got to do with Linglong?

546
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,920
Now, you want to know?

547
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,960
Cut to the chase.

548
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,630
Answer me!

549
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,670
I’ll tell you

550
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,110
but you have to believe me.

551
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,440
She should leave with me

552
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,960
because she could be in danger anytime.

553
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,920
What danger?

554
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,230
Do you see that twinkle?

555
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,480
It comes from the Flying Crystal

556
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,070
outsiders use to send messages.

557
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,030
I bet

558
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,360
I’m not the only one

559
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480
knowing that secret.

560
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,400
Linglong!

561
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,440
Leave us alone,

562
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,480
or I’ll kill you!

563
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,510
Think hard.

564
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,920
What would

565
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
the great Emperor Yuan Tu do?

566
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,630
Hey.

567
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,360
I knew my father was unable to change.

568
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,920
He said he’d ask you about the truth

569
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,110
but he didn’t follow through.

570
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,360
You must’ve known

571
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,670
that I’m Linglong,

572
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,710
and

573
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,880
what’s your name?

574
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,190
Yuan Yi.

575
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,000
That’s my name.

576
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,480
Yuan Yi,

577
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,440
thanks for saving me.

578
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,110
It’s done by a saber.

579
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,800
Saber?

580
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,150
Not that monster?

581
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,070
It’s not our saber?

582
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,550
No.

583
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,320
It’s been over 500 years.

584
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,840
