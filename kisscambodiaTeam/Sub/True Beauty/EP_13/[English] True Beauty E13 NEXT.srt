EPISODE 13

2
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:20,568
Angel? What a joke.

3
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,408
WELCOME TO SEBOM HIGH SCHOOL'S
ADMISSION INFORMATION SESSION.

4
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,478
- It's Ju Kyung.
- Hey, it's Lim Ju Kyung.

5
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,987
Seriously?

6
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:48,188
Ju Kyung. Is this really you?

7
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:53,228
The real face of Saebom High's Lim Ju Kyung.

8
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,837
She was the dumpling girl
before she transferred.

9
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:57,667
You guys will faint when you see this.

10
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,108
She's mad ugly. It's all makeup.

11
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:08,608
This is too much.

12
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:21,888
- No way.
- What a joke.

13
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:30,668
Look at this. My gosh.

14
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,267
Unbelievable.

15
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:42,817
Ju Kyung.

16
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:52,227
Ju Kyung.

17
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:58,798
Ju Kyung.

18
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:10,178
Lim Ju Kyung.

19
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:15,178
An angel? As if.

20
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,917
Drag her along.

21
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:21,518
No, let go of me.

22
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:23,317
Let go!

23
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:32,297
I thought it was Han Seo Jun you were dating.

24
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:34,368
But Lee Soo Ho?

25
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,167
- Seriously?
- What a flirt.

26
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:39,067
How did you seduce him
with this face of yours?

27
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:41,338
No way.

28
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:42,778
Does he know your real face?

29
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:44,537
If not, he'll dump you.

30
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:48,208
But if he does know? How
are we to interpret that?

31
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:51,547
An angel, my foot.

32
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:53,787
Grab her.

33
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:54,947
What are you doing?

34
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,317
- Stand still!
- Come on.

35
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:58,857
We just want to look at your real face.

36
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:01,387
- No, don't!
- But it'll be fun.

37
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:02,958
Don't!

38
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:05,498
- Unbelievable.
- Darn.

39
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,238
Is that her?

40
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,338
- No, don't!
- Why not?

41
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:13,268
Her skin already looks different.

42
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:15,208
- What a joke.
- Don't!

43
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,477
- Seriously.
- Are you kidding me?

44
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,537
Just look at this.

45
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:19,808
- No way.
- Can you believe it?

46
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:22,977
Get your hands off her.

47
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:34,857
Ju Kyung? Ju Kyung!

48
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,327
Ju Kyung. Out of my way!

49
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:42,697
Ju Kyung? Ju Kyung!

50
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:48,438
Where are you off to?

51
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:50,877
Are you crying?

52
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:55,748
Hey, Ju Kyung!

53
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,317
- Have you seen Ju Kyung?
- Did you two argue again?

54
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:05,488
Did you see her or not?

55
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,227
She ran that way...

56
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,797
Whatever. Who cares if they argue?

57
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:15,768
Seo Jun! You won't believe
this about Lim Ju Kyung.

58
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:19,208
Don't ever mention her to me
again. I'd rather not care.

59
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:22,037
Just take a look at this. Here.

60
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:25,477
SHE'S MAD UGLY. IT'S ALL MAKEUP.

61
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:29,747
SHE'S MAD UGLY. IT'S ALL MAKEUP.

62
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,388
BOYFRIEND

63
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,427
The fact that Lee Soo Ho's dating you...

64
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:18,898
makes him seem like a loser too.

65
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:20,628
BOYFRIEND

66
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:22,198
4 MISSED CALLS, BOYFRIEND 3

67
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:38,477
- Did you see that video?
- Of course.

68
00:05:38,477 --> 00:05:40,347
I can't believe we almost fell for it.

69
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:42,218
Angel Lim Ju Kyung? As if.

70
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,557
Tell me about it. Look how ugly she is.

71
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:45,658
Seriously.

72
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:46,958
Darn it.

73
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:48,758
- What did you just say?
- What?

74
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:50,227
- I dare you to repeat that.
- What?

75
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:51,297
Darn it!

76
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,727
Are you kidding me?

77
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:56,597
- Hey...
- What's your problem?

78
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,408
- Shouldn't we call the teacher?
- Guys, stop it.

79
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:00,537
What?

80
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:02,338
- Say that again.
- What?

81
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:03,908
I dare you to say it again!

82
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,977
- Say that again!
- Say what again?

83
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,047
Lim Ju Young, stop. Just stop!

84
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:13,218
Don't.

85
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:20,588
Have a seat.

86
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:28,468
Calm down and let your anger subside.

87
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,867
There you go. Good job.

88
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,307
I'm upset about what happened to Ju Kyung,

89
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,948
but violence should never be the answer.

90
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:45,347
They say, "Not even a flower
should be used as a weapon."

91
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:49,057
Anything can be solved through words.

92
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:52,958
Hand.

93
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:57,758
When did you become a puppy?

94
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,468
Here. I saw scars on your hand.

95
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:13,977
She's unrecognizable, don't you think?

96
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:15,648
My eyes nearly popped out.

97
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,247
- What happens now?
- Beats me.

98
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,287
- Is it something entertaining?
- Hello, sir.

99
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:21,718
- It's this way.
- I know.

100
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,117
It's time for the morning assembly.

101
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,597
I don't see Ju Kyung or Soo Ho.

102
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,597
Maybe they went on a date.

103
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:42,838
Mr. Han, I think Ju Kyung
is going to be absent today.

104
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:45,107
I wonder if she's sick.

105
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,448
By any chance, is she absent because of me?

106
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:48,908
Hee Kyung.

107
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:51,318
- Hello.
- Mr. Han?

108
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:52,378
We're dating.

109
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:54,187
Why do you have to date my homeroom teacher?

110
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:55,987
This is going to make my
school life so uncomfortable.

111
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:00,687
Mr. Han, Seo Jun is absent too.

112
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,028
- He's absent too?
- Yes.

113
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:10,537
It's Han Seo Jun.

114
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,867
What's he doing here?

115
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:13,307
He's so good-looking.

116
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:15,408
- Who is he?
- I don't know. He's so handsome.

117
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:16,477
Is he from Saebom High School?

118
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:23,477
Hey, Seo Jun.

119
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:24,878
I heard you asked for me. Why?

120
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,088
I told you I won't stand still if
you did this kind of thing again.

121
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,357
And what exactly are you going to do to me?

122
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,417
Delete it while I'm being nice.

123
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,258
- Delete what?
- The video you showed me yesterday!

124
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:37,258
You uploaded that on our school community.

125
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:38,898
What? Your school community?

126
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:40,628
What are you talking about?

127
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:44,498
Someone uploaded that on
your online school community?

128
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,837
My gosh, that's unbelievable.

129
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,537
You came here because of that?

130
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:50,608
Well, I'm sorry to tell
you this, but it wasn't me.

131
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,648
- It wasn't you?
- No, it wasn't.

132
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,478
Dumpling doesn't even go to our school.

133
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:56,518
Why would I upload it on
your online school community?

134
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:00,518
No one else would do that garbage but you.

135
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:04,488
That's not true.

136
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:09,297
How do you think I found out
that Lim Ju Kyung was Dumpling?

137
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:16,797
Will I...

138
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,207
be able to get married?

139
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:43,228
The guardian card?

140
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:45,197
Mr. Prince, is Ju Kyung here?

141
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:47,427
No.

142
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:05,518
My goodness. Hey, Soo Ho.

143
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,248
Hello, by any chance...

144
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:10,258
My gosh, why do you look so haggard?

145
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:12,417
- Is your leg okay?
- Yes, is Ju Kyung...

146
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:16,098
How's Joo... I mean, how's your father doing?

147
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:17,927
I guess he's doing okay.

148
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:20,998
I shouldn't have asked.

149
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:23,937
- By any chance, did Ju Kyung...
- What? Ju Kyung?

150
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,768
Never mind. I'll be off now.

151
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:29,337
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

152
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,138
Don't skip meals!

153
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:33,648
And be careful of cars. You don't
want to get into another accident.

154
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:38,547
Shouldn't he be at school right now?

155
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,417
I wonder why he came here.

156
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:46,258
Ju Kyung, that brat.

157
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,667
My gosh, she must've bought
more makeup products.

158
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,228
What's this?

159
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,197
STUDENT REGISTRATION CARD

160
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:08,577
"COSMETOLOGIST LICENSE WRITTEN TEST BOOK"

161
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,077
That little...

162
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:14,988
Soo Ah, you really didn't know?

163
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:17,158
You and Ju Kyung were best friends.

164
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:19,187
Best friends, my foot.

165
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,327
- Come on.
- She acted like she was pretty...

166
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:22,998
and even became our school model?

167
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:25,128
- I know, right?
- How did she end up dating Soo Ho?

168
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:26,228
- I'd never be able to do that.
- I'm sure he didn't know...

169
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,268
how she looked like with no makeup on.

170
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:29,398
- Do you want to make a bet?
- Watch what you say.

171
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:34,868
What was that?

172
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:39,408
Follow me outside.

173
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:42,378
- Why?
- Do you want me to say it here?

174
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,317
The class is about to start.

175
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:50,957
Just follow me outside.

176
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,888
- What's going on?
- Hey, stop him.

177
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:58,898
- Shouldn't we stop him?
- What's going on?

178
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:00,728
Let go of me.

179
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:04,498
Were you always a piece of trash?

180
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,167
- Delete the video.
- No.

181
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,508
"No"?

182
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,307
Why do you care?

183
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:17,478
What do you think Soo Ho would
think of you if he finds out?

184
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:21,287
Delete the video before I
go and tell him it was you!

185
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:23,158
Go ahead and tell him. I'm not scared.

186
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,488
- What?
- Plus, I can't delete it.

187
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,827
It's not like deleting it
is going to change anything.

188
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,528
Everyone in the school
has watched it already.

189
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:33,628
Why are you doing this?

190
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,268
Is it because of Soo Ho?

191
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:39,437
Do you think he'll even think of
you as a friend if he finds out?

192
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:40,567
"A friend"?

193
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,638
I don't want to stay as his friend
only to like him one-sidedly...

194
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:46,148
like you're doing with Ju Kyung.

195
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:49,748
I bet you think...

196
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:53,047
you destroyed Ju Kyung by doing this.

197
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,187
But you just destroyed yourself.

198
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,378
- Cho Rong.
- Yes?

199
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,547
- Come outside.
- Let me just get this...

200
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,077
precious poop out.

201
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:22,478
Just get out there already.

202
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,018
Gosh.

203
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:29,858
- My gosh.
- Hey, what are you doing?

204
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:33,128
I heard only the school community
webmaster can delete the posts.

205
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:34,128
Who's the webmaster?

206
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:35,587
How would I know?

207
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:36,927
Why don't you know?

208
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,567
I don't even know when this
poop is going to come out!

209
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:40,898
Then hurry up and find out.

210
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:43,837
How do you expect me to find
out who the webmaster...

211
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:45,768
Wait a minute, Seo Jun.

212
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,108
What do you have anything to do with this?

213
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:50,337
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you're being...

214
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:53,077
No way. Do you like Ju Kyung?

215
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:55,478
Cut the nonsense. Just find out who it is.

216
00:13:55,478 --> 00:13:58,317
How am I supposed to find out, you dumb punk?

217
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,457
What's the matter with your class?

218
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,898
I heard two of your students...

219
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,297
didn't come to school without notice.

220
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:15,327
That's probably because their
homeroom teacher is too busy dating.

221
00:14:15,827 --> 00:14:16,967
"Dating"?

222
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:23,937
Hee Kyung, do you think we were too selfish?

223
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:56,608
Hey, kid.

224
00:14:58,378 --> 00:14:59,978
You know this is the last stop, right?

225
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,327
Where are you? Ju Kyung.

226
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:17,758
Just tell me where you are.

227
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:18,957
GIRLFRIEND

228
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:29,367
Hey, kid.

229
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:31,397
You're still here?

230
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:33,468
You missed the last bus.

231
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,438
It's too late. You should go home.

232
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:36,537
It's cold outside.

233
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,037
You should hurry up and go home.

234
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:42,247
Go home, okay? My goodness.

235
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:47,818
BOYFRIEND: JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.

236
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:49,318
YOU HAVE 4 MISSED CALLS.

237
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,457
You will be directed to voicemail.

238
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:32,657
Ju Kyung, where are you?

239
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,068
Where are you?

240
00:17:35,627 --> 00:17:38,098
Just tell me where you are, okay?

241
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,318
- Hello?
- Is your sister home yet?

242
00:17:57,657 --> 00:17:59,117
No, she isn't.

243
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,988
Where is she at this hour?

244
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,157
Got it.

245
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:20,278
Ju Kyung!

246
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:28,248
Ju Kyung.

247
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:20,367
Ju Kyung.

248
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:26,177
Ju Kyung.

249
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,540
"COSMETOLOGIST LICENSE WRITTEN TEST BOOK"

250
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,550
STUDENT REGISTRATION CARD

251
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:45,382
Ju Kyung, is that you?

252
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:47,832
Where did you go with your phone off?

253
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:48,862
The study room.

254
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:50,901
- Don't you lie to me!
- Honey.

255
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,731
You went to this makeup academy, didn't you?

256
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,141
I wondered where you were
until late every night.

257
00:19:57,471 --> 00:19:58,542
Let's talk later.

258
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:01,441
Where did you get the money to pay for this?

259
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,012
I've had a really tough day.

260
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:07,012
- Let's talk tomorrow.
- Answer me!

261
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:09,812
Where did you get the money to
do this garbage behind my back?

262
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,352
You're home.

263
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:15,052
- I got a job.
- What?

264
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:17,522
A job?

265
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,032
You got a job instead of working?

266
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:23,901
Who said you could do this?

267
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,431
I said let's talk tomorrow. Leave me alone!

268
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:28,272
Yes, honey. Let's talk tomorrow.

269
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,641
- Yes, Mom.
- Shut it.

270
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:34,112
Say you won't do this
stupid makeup stuff. Now!

271
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:37,782
Why...

272
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:41,252
Why must it be makeup?

273
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:46,322
Do you want to end up like me?

274
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:53,832
Demand a refund tomorrow.

275
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:56,961
No. I'll do it myself.

276
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,201
If you do this again,

277
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,332
I'll kick you out of this house. Got that?

278
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:01,971
Why must you do this too?

279
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:04,671
I want to do it. What's so wrong with that?

280
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:08,171
Why does everyone tell me no?

281
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:12,112
I want to do what I want
and see the person I like!

282
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:14,711
Can't I be happy?

283
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:16,612
Don't I have that right?

284
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:20,451
You brat! Get back here!

285
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:22,421
- Honey. Honey.
- Ju Kyung!

286
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:25,762
- Honey.
- Let go of me!

287
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:27,961
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

288
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:45,082
Ju Kyung.

289
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:14,572
She's dating Soo Ho with this
face? They are not a good match.

290
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:16,371
Soo Ho, get it together, man.

291
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:18,681
Shouldn't we get a new model for the school?

292
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:20,582
What if people call us the ugly school?

293
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:22,181
What an easy life thanks to makeup.

294
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,752
Compared to her, I have the face of an angel.

295
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:26,852
I'd kill myself if there
were a video like this of me.

296
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:29,752
Who posted this? Isn't this school violence?

297
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,231
I'll kill everyone who posts
nasty comments after me.

298
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:47,012
Look at his face.

299
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:54,451
"I'll kill everyone who posts
nasty comments after me."

300
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:56,612
How cringy.

301
00:22:56,612 --> 00:23:00,391
"I'll kill everyone who posts
nasty comments after me."

302
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:01,852
Shut it.

303
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:03,421
"Shut it."

304
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:07,492
Why you... Cho Rong. Cho Rong!

305
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,431
Did you find the webmaster?

306
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:10,832
Wait.

307
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:16,471
Tell me who the webmaster is, and
you get a date with Han Seo Jun.

308
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:18,572
- Not a joke.
- Seo Jun.

309
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,441
What will you do once we find the webmaster?

310
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,812
Are you her knight in shining
armor who will save her?

311
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:25,181
- Seo Jun likes...
- Hey.

312
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:27,752
- Eat this.
- Ju Kyung!

313
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:29,282
Where?

314
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,951
Hi, I'm Ju Kyung. Hi, Seo Jun.

315
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:34,552
I'm not that easy.

316
00:23:48,832 --> 00:23:51,572
Please wait for the next signal.

317
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:26,141
Why are you calling? To hear my voice first?

318
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:28,911
Stop.

319
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:31,411
Don't cross the street.

320
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:34,012
Let's talk like this.

321
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:37,951
I'll lose my resolve if I see your face.

322
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:39,421
What do you mean?

323
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:43,252
Let's...

324
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:48,461
- break up for a while.
- What?

325
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:50,961
Out of the blue? Why?

326
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:52,832
I don't think this is right.

327
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,572
I didn't know it would
hurt Ju Kyung this much.

328
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:59,002
Had I known you were her sister,

329
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,542
I wouldn't have even started it.

330
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:03,671
That's overkill.

331
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:05,411
Who breaks over something like this?

332
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:09,082
I... I'm being transferred next year.

333
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:10,921
In a year's time.

334
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,792
Exactly at this hour on this day next year,

335
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:16,721
if we still love each
other in a year from now,

336
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:19,921
let's get back together then.

337
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:21,332
What? A year?

338
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:24,362
Stop. Stop.

339
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:26,201
Please stop.

340
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:32,901
Goodbye.

341
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:41,352
Joon Woo!

342
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:43,481
Han Joon Woo!

343
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:47,252
What kind of a breakup is this?

344
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:55,161
Soo Ho.

345
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:00,901
- Why have you come?
- I've known you for years.

346
00:26:01,832 --> 00:26:04,802
I felt I should apologize
for causing you pain...

347
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,242
with Se Yeon's matter.

348
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:09,911
You should apologize to
him and his family, not me.

349
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:12,681
You're right. I went to them...

350
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:14,582
and begged for forgiveness.

351
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:17,322
I'll live in repentance
for the rest of my life.

352
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:21,522
Soo Ho. Your father really...

353
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:23,421
didn't know.

354
00:26:24,862 --> 00:26:27,231
He took the fall for it though.

355
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:31,701
Even in the past. He never crossed the line.

356
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:33,931
Why are you the one explaining that to me?

357
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:35,572
He may not be good at expressing it,

358
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:37,302
but he cares deeply for you.

359
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:38,842
That I know.

360
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:42,742
So resent me all you want,

361
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:45,681
but not your father.

362
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:49,911
I wanted to tell you that...

363
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:53,522
after hearing how much pain this brought you.

364
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,552
I'll get going.

365
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:10,842
Are you free today?

366
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:14,711
I'm leaving the country soon and
would like to see you before I do.

367
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:19,042
- Soo Ho!
- Where's Ju Kyung?

368
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:21,881
She'll probably be skipping school today too.

369
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,812
Then tell her to pick up her phone.

370
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,881
I doubt she's in a position to do so.

371
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,022
Aren't you going to school?

372
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,391
All this because I forbid you
from taking makeup classes?

373
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:34,532
Why is she suddenly being a moody teenager?

374
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:36,131
Just head to the salon.

375
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:38,661
I'll have a quiet talk with her later.

376
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,431
RESTRICTED ACCESS

377
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:42,832
Then tell her I'll be
waiting at Prince Comics.

378
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:46,042
Gosh. You really must love her.

379
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:48,012
Skipping school yet again?

380
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,042
No, just get to school.

381
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,141
I'll tell my dad to have
her answer her phone...

382
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:54,282
once she calms down a bit.

383
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:57,582
Off we go.

384
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:03,691
Hold on. Which brand are those sneakers from?

385
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:07,161
That was immature of me, right?

386
00:28:07,431 --> 00:28:08,532
Forget I said anything.

387
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:13,931
The online bulletin board has been firing up.

388
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:17,032
- My goodness.
- Look at all these hate comments.

389
00:28:17,842 --> 00:28:20,441
We should probably shut
down the school website.

390
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:21,572
I guess we should.

391
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:23,141
Gosh.

392
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:26,181
Is this why she was absent
from school yesterday?

393
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:28,881
How are we supposed to handle this?

394
00:28:29,612 --> 00:28:31,721
The kids in the video aren't
students at our school,

395
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:33,052
so we can't call a committee hearing.

396
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:36,721
And how are we supposed to
find out who posted this?

397
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,421
What about Ju Kyung? Is
she not at school today?

398
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:40,992
No.

399
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:43,292
And we have a student
refusing to come to school.

400
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:46,032
The incident seems to be of grave nature,

401
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:49,032
so you should discuss this
with Ju Kyung's parents.

402
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:50,971
Yes, sir.

403
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:55,911
Han Joon Woo, did you have
to overreact like that?

404
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:57,312
In a year's time.

405
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:59,481
If we still love each
other in a year from now,

406
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:01,451
let's get back together then.

407
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:05,252
Hee Kyung, do you have the
materials for the meeting?

408
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:10,661
A year, my foot!

409
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:12,691
Darn it.

410
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:14,792
Okay, take all the time you want.

411
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:19,002
REAL FACE, MONSTER

412
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:27,002
Look at what they did to her face.

413
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:30,371
- Soo Ho, it's you.
- Hey.

414
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,042
Watch what you say, okay?

415
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:37,621
UGLY FACE! ROTTEN SMILE!

416
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:38,822
Who on earth did this?

417
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:41,852
Why not just rip it off?

418
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:46,992
SUPER UGLY!

419
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:48,231
How's Ju Kyung?

420
00:29:52,302 --> 00:29:55,901
The one who uploaded that video of her...

421
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:57,941
I know.

422
00:29:58,742 --> 00:29:59,871
You do?

423
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:10,252
I love you so much, oh dear

424
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:13,681
You're too pretty, what do I do?

425
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,822
My eyes already need cleansing.

426
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:19,522
I'm not in the mood to laugh, so stop.

427
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:22,762
How about a smile? I'd love to see it

428
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,102
Just smile for me, giggle!

429
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:28,332
Leave it to you to make me smile.

430
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:29,471
You laughed!

431
00:30:29,572 --> 00:30:32,141
I love it that you smiled

432
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:33,701
Oh, dear

433
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:35,141
What do I do?

434
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,312
I'm thrilled

435
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:39,681
You're too pretty, what do I do?

436
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:43,812
Soo Ah, I love it that you smiled

437
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:45,082
Oh, dear

438
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:48,221
I'm on the moon, my gosh

439
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:51,391
Guys, take your seats
for the morning assembly.

440
00:31:01,602 --> 00:31:04,201
Once again, Ju Kyung is absent today.

441
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:07,242
Mr. Han, will we be choosing
a new face for the school?

442
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,312
- Kids have been wondering.
- Exactly.

443
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:12,181
How can Ju Kyung be the face of our school?

444
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:14,112
- I know.
- Right?

445
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:15,451
Gosh.

446
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:18,481
Is that why you ripped all her posters off?

447
00:31:21,492 --> 00:31:23,391
You know why she isn't at school today...

448
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:25,421
and must be aware of...

449
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:26,992
how she's feeling right now.

450
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:30,562
But I see that no one's worried about her.

451
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:35,032
I'm disappointed in you all.

452
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:37,032
Your actions terrify me.

453
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:39,772
How can you laugh at a video...

454
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:40,971
of your friend being humiliated like that?

455
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:45,242
Is the pain that Ju Kyung had to suffer...

456
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:47,282
just a joke to you?

457
00:31:54,752 --> 00:31:56,522
Ju Kyung, have you eaten anything?

458
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:57,891
Don't tell me you're still crying.

459
00:31:57,891 --> 00:31:59,921
- It's Lee Soo Ho.
- Do you think it's true?

460
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:00,961
I doubt they're dating.

461
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,532
Yes, Ju Kyung and I are dating.

462
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,532
- What?
- No way.

463
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:08,471
Soo Ho, don't you have anything to say to me?

464
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:10,171
Like what?

465
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:13,602
Why didn't you tell me
that you two were dating?

466
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:16,242
After all I did to bring you two together?

467
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:17,681
It killed me inside...

468
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:20,381
to know that she had rejected you!

469
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:22,411
Being worried...

470
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:25,481
kept me up at night. I
thought I was your friend.

471
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,552
Right. Sorry about that.

472
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:29,352
Ju Kyung wanted to keep it a secret.

473
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:30,891
Do you know what's more upsetting?

474
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:33,961
Han Seo Jun seemed to be
aware of you two dating.

475
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,231
So?

476
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:37,762
You make up and now I'm kicked to the curb?

477
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:40,802
Who would you save if Seo Jun and I...

478
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:42,032
- were both drowning?
- You.

479
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,002
Me? Really?

480
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:45,102
Seo Jun's good at swimming.

481
00:32:45,102 --> 00:32:46,971
You'll still save me first, right?

482
00:32:48,871 --> 00:32:52,282
- So...
- Yes, my friend. Ask me anything.

483
00:32:52,282 --> 00:32:55,381
What's the best way to lift
up a girlfriend's mood?

484
00:32:55,752 --> 00:32:58,381
I wasn't going to tell you this, but...

485
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:01,921
RESTRICTED ACCESS

486
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:04,891
Ju Kyung, don't you want anything to eat?

487
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:09,661
I taped back the student registration card...

488
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:12,032
for your makeup classes.

489
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:15,231
I'll persuade your mother on this,

490
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:18,742
so please come out and
eat something. Ju Kyung?

491
00:33:20,242 --> 00:33:21,372
Ju Kyung...

492
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:28,552
Check out that smell.

493
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:32,722
Can this look any better? I
bet it's driving you crazy.

494
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:34,992
Welcome to "Dad's Delicious Food Trip".

495
00:33:34,992 --> 00:33:38,392
The pork belly grilled by
me couldn't be juicier.

496
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:40,092
This looks amazing.

497
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:43,331
Come on out. How can you persuade
your mom on an empty stomach?

498
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:45,631
Don't you want her approval?

499
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:47,831
Okay, let me take a bite first.

500
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:50,472
You won't believe how good this is.

501
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,802
I've never tasted pork belly quite like this.

502
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:56,311
Is this pork belly or ice cream?

503
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:59,912
Come on out and have the
pork belly I grill...

504
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,251
that melts in your mouth.

505
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:07,892
Seo Jun! Seo Jun...

506
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,291
- I...
- What?

507
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:14,021
What are you saying?

508
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:15,992
Is it huge?

509
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,362
Is it your stomach?

510
00:34:18,302 --> 00:34:19,302
Is it about a university?

511
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:22,472
It's about the school community!

512
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:24,702
- Found...
- You found...

513
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:27,142
You figured out who the webmaster is?

514
00:34:27,142 --> 00:34:28,412
Who is it?

515
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:34,142
FRESHMAN, JIN HUI JEONG

516
00:34:37,552 --> 00:34:39,322
Seo Jun, wait.

517
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,052
Wait for me!

518
00:34:42,052 --> 00:34:44,092
- Stop it.
- Get back here!

519
00:34:45,162 --> 00:34:47,592
Let go of me, you crazy cow!

520
00:34:47,592 --> 00:34:48,731
I know it was you.

521
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:51,762
I don't care if you received a
tip. How dare you post that online!

522
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:53,802
Take it up with the one
who actually posted it!

523
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:55,802
Who am I to censor everything?

524
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,472
- Why that little...
- Let go of me!

525
00:34:58,242 --> 00:35:00,242
Didn't you tell me that
violence wasn't the answer?

526
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:02,171
Not even a flower should
be used to hit people.

527
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:04,481
And who on earth are you? Let go of me!

528
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:06,612
Get your hands off her!

529
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:08,952
- What...
- No way.

530
00:35:08,952 --> 00:35:10,112
It's Han Seo Jun.

531
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:11,322
Seo Jun...

532
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:14,552
Yes, it's Han Seo Jun!

533
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:18,322
- It's Han Seo Jun!
- Who are you to butt in, brother?

534
00:35:18,592 --> 00:35:19,662
Brother?

535
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:21,162
Did you know?

536
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:23,362
What did you just say to my sister?

537
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:25,331
Sister?

538
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,331
He's her brother?

539
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,171
Han Go Woon's his sister?

540
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:31,441
A crazy what?

541
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:32,501
- No way.
- My gosh.

542
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:41,251
Are you the webmaster of
the online school community?

543
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:43,552
Yes.

544
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:45,921
You'll take the video down, right?

545
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:51,262
Unbelievable. I told you not
to make it known at school.

546
00:35:51,762 --> 00:35:54,021
Was I supposed to stand by and do nothing?

547
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:56,191
I held back, you know.

548
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:57,631
You should've held back more.

549
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:02,702
By the way, why don't you want
people to know I'm your brother?

550
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,901
- Are you ashamed of me?
- You're clueless.

551
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,572
You...

552
00:36:06,572 --> 00:36:08,872
It'll be like middle school all over again.

553
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:10,112
Girls will ask me to set them up with you...

554
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,581
and pick on me for not looking like you.

555
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:13,682
Tell me who they are and I'll...

556
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:16,651
Forget it. Don't ever set your
foot on the freshman floor again.

557
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,021
Go Woon!

558
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:21,592
Fly, don't you dare follow me.

559
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:24,992
Why not? I thought you were
deeply worried about me.

560
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,122
You.

561
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,992
What... What?

562
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,231
Are you still bothering her?

563
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:33,262
Must I teach you a lesson?

564
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:34,572
Why though?

565
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:36,572
Am I not even allowed to like her?

566
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:38,342
Haven't you ever liked anyone before?

567
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,171
Do you think I can just
stop loving her just...

568
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:43,142
because you tell me not to?

569
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:44,941
I have no control over my feelings, okay?

570
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:51,881
Bye then.

571
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:12,372
I'm sorry.

572
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:22,112
Did something happen between you guys?

573
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:24,782
What? No, why?

574
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:27,222
Never mind.

575
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:31,052
That video of Ju Kyung got
deleted from the school community.

576
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,691
Really? That's great.

577
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,492
Let's go.

578
00:37:51,782 --> 00:37:52,811
Soo Ho.

579
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:55,782
Gosh, you came again?

580
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:58,251
I told you I'll let you know
once Ju Kyung feels better.

581
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:01,222
Why don't you just set up a
tent in front of our house?

582
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:02,952
Can you give her this?

583
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:04,492
This is a nice gesture,

584
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:06,921
but she won't even come out of her room.

585
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,592
Then she wouldn't have eaten.
Are you going to let her starve?

586
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:11,901
It's nice that you're looking out for her,

587
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:14,331
but my job isn't to run your errands.

588
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,331
Do you want me to pay you?

589
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:25,342
Do you want my shoes?

590
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:28,412
Soo Ho, I'd love to have...

591
00:38:29,782 --> 00:38:32,552
No, wait. I shouldn't use my
sister to get what I want.

592
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:35,722
Give me that. I just need
to give it to her, right?

593
00:38:54,372 --> 00:38:55,572
Ju Kyung.

594
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:57,572
Ju Kyung.

595
00:39:00,912 --> 00:39:03,552
Gosh, you're so quiet in there.

596
00:39:05,322 --> 00:39:08,452
Is she thinking of doing
something bad to herself?

597
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:11,921
Ju Kyung! No!

598
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:16,492
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung, no!

599
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:17,901
Ju Kyung... What?

600
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:21,532
What are you doing?

601
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:24,432
Ju Kyung, you startled me!

602
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:27,242
Hey, wait.

603
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:30,242
Soo Ho bought you this.

604
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:33,041
You should have a bite.

605
00:39:37,952 --> 00:39:40,421
Soo Ho's been waiting for
you ever since yesterday.

606
00:39:40,651 --> 00:39:42,452
At least pick up his calls.

607
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:13,981
I've been meaning to
come to see you, Mr. Han.

608
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:16,251
I found out...

609
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:18,492
that Ju Kyung wants to learn makeup.

610
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:20,691
You have no idea how
frustrated I am right now.

611
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:21,791
She even got a part-time job...

612
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,191
and enrolled herself into
an academy behind my back.

613
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:24,802
My goodness.

614
00:40:25,162 --> 00:40:26,631
Did you know about this?

615
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:29,372
Ma'am, the thing is,

616
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:32,441
that's not why I wanted to meet you today.

617
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:35,612
That's not why?

618
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:41,311
This might shock you.

619
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,881
But I feel like you should know
what Ju Kyung's going through...

620
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:48,021
since you're her mother.

621
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:14,981
Is...

622
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:17,581
Is this Ju Kyung?

623
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,291
Are you sure this isn't fake?

624
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:31,802
Is this really my daughter?

625
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:37,771
Ju Kyung...

626
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:57,291
Ju Kyung?

627
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,001
Hey.

628
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:10,068
Did you wait out in the
cold? You should've called.

629
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:12,907
I came to ask you something.

630
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:16,237
You came to ask me something?

631
00:42:17,278 --> 00:42:19,248
I know it can't be you.

632
00:42:20,878 --> 00:42:23,117
But I couldn't stop imagining stuff.

633
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:26,847
Soo Jin.

634
00:42:29,688 --> 00:42:30,887
It wasn't you, right?

635
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,657
You're the only one...

636
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:39,998
who knows my secret including the fact...

637
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:42,298
that I'm dating Soo Ho.

638
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:47,007
I couldn't think of anyone
else who knows that.

639
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,608
But still, it wasn't you, right?

640
00:42:51,478 --> 00:42:53,577
You weren't the one who uploaded
that post online, right?

641
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:55,617
If you don't think it
wasn't me, why are you here?

642
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,787
Because I wanted to hear it from you.

643
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:06,287
I'm sorry. I can't tell
you what you want to hear.

644
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:09,327
Why?

645
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:13,228
Why did you do that?

646
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:17,398
Why would you do something like that to me?

647
00:43:17,737 --> 00:43:19,967
Because I hated seeing you with him.

648
00:43:22,677 --> 00:43:23,807
What?

649
00:43:24,077 --> 00:43:25,177
You came to our school
because you got bullied...

650
00:43:25,177 --> 00:43:26,478
at Yongpa High School, right?

651
00:43:27,077 --> 00:43:28,947
Why don't you go ahead and run away again?

652
00:43:29,577 --> 00:43:30,748
You're good at doing that.

653
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:33,987
Run as far as you can and hide...

654
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:36,117
so no one finds you.

655
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:38,458
That's all I have to say to you.

656
00:44:50,827 --> 00:44:54,938
LIM JU KYUNG'S SPOT. SIT WITHOUT
PERMISSION, AND GET A HAIRY BUTT!

657
00:45:22,298 --> 00:45:24,458
I organized all the books. Is there
anything else you want me to do?

658
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,927
You don't need to do anything.
Just read the comic books.

659
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:29,398
I need to do something to kill time.

660
00:45:29,398 --> 00:45:31,907
Why are you killing time here?

661
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:34,338
Be honest with me. Ju Bal
dumped you, didn't she?

662
00:45:34,338 --> 00:45:35,608
- No.
- Gosh, come on.

663
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:38,577
If a guy waits night and day in
front of his girlfriend's house,

664
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:40,478
that's always why.

665
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:41,677
That's not it.

666
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:44,018
You're frustrated, right?

667
00:45:45,518 --> 00:45:46,648
Pick a card.

668
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:49,287
I'll tell you how Ju Bal feels.

669
00:45:49,617 --> 00:45:50,688
I'm good.

670
00:45:50,787 --> 00:45:53,057
You have to kill time anyway.

671
00:45:53,057 --> 00:45:54,287
Pick one.

672
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:12,278
Wait. That's the Lovers card.

673
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,018
What does it mean if you
pick it up upside down?

674
00:46:15,518 --> 00:46:16,617
Hold on.

675
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:26,787
THE LOVERS

676
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:30,427
UPSIDE DOWN: PARTING

677
00:46:59,487 --> 00:47:01,827
- Ju Kyung.
- Where did you go?

678
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,827
Out front.

679
00:47:04,298 --> 00:47:05,367
Did you eat?

680
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:06,867
I'm not hungry.

681
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:11,097
Why not? You brat...

682
00:47:17,307 --> 00:47:18,608
My baby.

683
00:47:20,248 --> 00:47:21,378
Mom.

684
00:47:22,617 --> 00:47:24,278
Mom went to your school today.

685
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:29,887
Why didn't you tell me?

686
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,327
You should've told me.

687
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,757
Why did you keep it pent up all by yourself?

688
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:38,057
Because I knew you'd do this.

689
00:47:38,697 --> 00:47:39,898
How could I tell you?

690
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,197
Even still! You should've told me!

691
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:47,768
I had no idea that was happening to my baby.

692
00:47:58,248 --> 00:47:59,487
Who was it?

693
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,287
I'm going to get them
back. Tell me. Who was it?

694
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:06,458
- Mom.
- Mom. Stop crying.

695
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,057
You'll upset Ju Kyung.

696
00:48:10,827 --> 00:48:14,068
It must've been so painful for my baby.

697
00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:22,478
Did...

698
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:26,778
the kids hit you?

699
00:48:27,878 --> 00:48:29,478
Where did they hit you?

700
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,588
Tell me now.

701
00:48:33,887 --> 00:48:36,958
No. They didn't hit me.

702
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:39,887
It's in the past. I'm fine.

703
00:48:41,557 --> 00:48:42,697
I'm fine.

704
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:50,967
My baby.

705
00:48:53,668 --> 00:48:55,037
I'm so sorry.

706
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:21,898
I didn't know because she was always smiling.

707
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:27,068
It's because I killed her self-esteem.

708
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,838
She was too scared to tell her own mom.

709
00:49:31,608 --> 00:49:32,778
It's all my fault.

710
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:35,077
Why is it your fault?

711
00:49:38,887 --> 00:49:40,418
We got pregnant with Ju Young...

712
00:49:40,987 --> 00:49:43,088
right after we had Ju Kyung,

713
00:49:43,518 --> 00:49:46,757
so we left her with my parents to raise her.

714
00:49:47,657 --> 00:49:50,398
That's why people said she was adopted.

715
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,467
She received no love at home,
so she got no love elsewhere.

716
00:49:58,137 --> 00:50:00,807
It's my fault for not raising her nicely...

717
00:50:01,438 --> 00:50:05,108
or treating her like she was precious.

718
00:50:05,478 --> 00:50:07,007
Whom else could I blame?

719
00:50:09,418 --> 00:50:10,617
It's my fault.

720
00:50:11,648 --> 00:50:13,548
You had to work your fingers to the bone...

721
00:50:14,148 --> 00:50:16,418
and had no time to look after
the kids. It's my fault.

722
00:50:17,487 --> 00:50:19,557
I yelled at her for wearing makeup.

723
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:24,028
That was why she got so upset
when I threw out her makeup.

724
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:34,168
I'm sorry I didn't know.

725
00:50:37,907 --> 00:50:39,108
It's nothing.

726
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:41,847
Ignore what those kids say.

727
00:50:42,548 --> 00:50:44,518
You decide your own worth.

728
00:50:44,717 --> 00:50:48,287
If you're confident, no one
can touch you. Understand?

729
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:54,427
Stop crying, and go to sleep.

730
00:52:03,128 --> 00:52:04,128
Get out.

731
00:52:04,398 --> 00:52:05,827
- Why?
- Get out.

732
00:52:08,298 --> 00:52:10,768
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

733
00:52:10,768 --> 00:52:12,108
Seriously.

734
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:25,117
Will you remove your glasses?

735
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:35,728
I think it'll cost quite a bit.

736
00:52:36,557 --> 00:52:40,197
Just make her beautiful. Like an angel.

737
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:42,367
- An angel.
- Mom.

738
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:47,938
First, she already has double eyelids,

739
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:51,507
so we can alter the shape of
the eyes to make them stand out.

740
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:55,978
We'll slit the inside and the outside.

741
00:52:56,617 --> 00:52:59,688
We'll make them bigger. Like the beauty apps.

742
00:52:59,987 --> 00:53:03,088
As for her nose, we'll add silicone...

743
00:53:03,088 --> 00:53:04,717
to raise the bridge.

744
00:53:04,717 --> 00:53:07,487
As for the tip, we'll cut off
a piece from the left ear,

745
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:10,398
implant cartilage to make it stand up...

746
00:53:10,557 --> 00:53:13,597
She has such a cute nose though.
It's like a clove of garlic.

747
00:53:13,967 --> 00:53:16,298
People complimented her nose all the time.

748
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:20,068
From a medical perspective,

749
00:53:21,137 --> 00:53:22,708
it is not a pretty nose.

750
00:53:24,978 --> 00:53:27,478
Also, we'll slice her hairline...

751
00:53:27,478 --> 00:53:28,778
and give her a facelift.

752
00:53:28,918 --> 00:53:31,418
We'll make it as tight as
possible and sew it on.

753
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:32,847
Then we'll take fat from the butt...

754
00:53:33,548 --> 00:53:36,588
and inject it into the
forehead, chin, and cheeks.

755
00:53:39,157 --> 00:53:41,487
With a full face fat transplant,

756
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:44,728
her flat face will have a
more three-dimensional look.

757
00:53:44,728 --> 00:53:46,728
Why does she need that?
She isn't a westerner.

758
00:53:48,068 --> 00:53:51,168
We'll grind down the entire
surface of her jaw...

759
00:53:51,268 --> 00:53:52,938
and carve out her cheekbones...

760
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:56,077
Why would you grind her face?
It's not a coffee bean or a spice.

761
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:58,778
That will give her a
narrower jawline. The v-line.

762
00:53:58,878 --> 00:54:02,007
You need a wider jawline for good fortune.

763
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,018
What do you want from me?

764
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:06,818
If you want to make this face pretty,

765
00:54:06,818 --> 00:54:09,418
you need to change everything.

766
00:54:09,418 --> 00:54:10,987
This isn't a renovation.

767
00:54:10,987 --> 00:54:12,458
What do you mean, change everything?

768
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,588
She'll become pretty if
you cut, carve, and grind?

769
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:17,557
Who sets the standard for
what's pretty and ugly?

770
00:54:17,557 --> 00:54:19,628
My daughter is pretty in my eyes.

771
00:54:19,628 --> 00:54:22,697
Mom. Stop that. Let's go.

772
00:54:22,697 --> 00:54:24,737
My gosh. Do you want to see it?

773
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:27,307
For this face to become pretty like this,

774
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:30,378
you have to change everything about it.

775
00:54:30,378 --> 00:54:34,048
Oh my gosh. This is the face we
get after spending all that money?

776
00:54:34,048 --> 00:54:36,617
She looks like this with just makeup on.

777
00:54:36,617 --> 00:54:38,378
What is this?

778
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:40,987
Plastic surgery is not as good
as my daughter's makeup skills.

779
00:54:42,018 --> 00:54:44,858
Let's go. Why would we put a
knife to this perfectly good face?

780
00:54:46,728 --> 00:54:47,827
But...

781
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:53,628
What? An angel?

782
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:13,518
I heard that video spread
all over the school.

783
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:18,287
Don't worry.

784
00:55:18,387 --> 00:55:21,157
I'll transfer you to a school
where nobody knows you.

785
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:23,827
What?

786
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:46,347
Why don't you go ahead and run away again?

787
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:48,318
You're good at doing that.

788
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:50,617
Run as far as you can and hide...

789
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:52,787
so no one finds you.

790
00:55:53,427 --> 00:55:54,757
That's all I have to say to you.

791
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:04,398
Ju Kyung's here.

792
00:56:15,148 --> 00:56:16,278
Were you crying?

793
00:56:17,048 --> 00:56:18,177
No.

794
00:56:21,018 --> 00:56:22,757
So why won't you let me see you?

795
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:26,188
Because I'm sorry.

796
00:56:26,628 --> 00:56:28,998
- About what?
- Because of me,

797
00:56:29,498 --> 00:56:31,697
kids have been making fun of you too.

798
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:35,737
It's why I can't look at you.

799
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,998
I'd still like to see you.

800
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:45,507
I waited for you here all day, my squirrel.

801
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:51,378
How can that not make you laugh? Meow.

802
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:55,387
Those jokes are old, you know.

803
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:00,487
- You still don't get it.
- What?

804
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:07,028
I'm so glad.

805
00:57:10,037 --> 00:57:11,498
I missed you so much.

806
00:57:27,287 --> 00:57:29,088
- Let's go outside.
- What?

807
00:57:29,287 --> 00:57:30,958
You can't hide here forever.

808
00:57:31,188 --> 00:57:32,327
Let's go.

809
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:40,068
Are you exhausted already?

810
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:42,798
Yes. Why don't we go back down?

811
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:47,608
- Put some muscle into it.
- I can't.

812
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:51,338
I've been starving all day,
so I'm lacking the energy.

813
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:55,177
- That leaves only one option.
- Yes, let's walk back down.

814
00:57:56,778 --> 00:57:58,778
I said we should walk back down!

815
00:57:59,818 --> 00:58:01,887
- I'm heavy, you know.
- Let's go.

816
00:58:02,248 --> 00:58:03,887
I said I'm heavy.

817
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:11,597
What do you think? Isn't it nice up here?

818
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:14,597
Yes, it is.

819
00:58:15,938 --> 00:58:18,637
Why did you run off that day?

820
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:22,978
You have me by your side now,

821
00:58:24,938 --> 00:58:26,148
so why did you run off?

822
00:58:29,278 --> 00:58:30,447
You're right.

823
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:32,748
I ran off again.

824
00:58:35,347 --> 00:58:37,117
I guess I wanted to hide.

825
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:39,827
Why would you hide when
you did nothing wrong?

826
00:58:39,858 --> 00:58:41,257
Because it's humiliating.

827
00:58:43,298 --> 00:58:44,528
The kids...

828
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:47,628
now know what I really look like.

829
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:51,597
What do I do?

830
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:56,177
Are you saying you look fake with makeup on?

831
00:58:58,778 --> 00:59:02,418
No matter how you look, makeup or no makeup,

832
00:59:03,478 --> 00:59:05,048
you're always you.

833
00:59:08,717 --> 00:59:10,458
So this is what I once read.

834
00:59:11,188 --> 00:59:14,757
Do you know which country
produces the tastiest tomatoes?

835
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,557
Spain.

836
00:59:20,467 --> 00:59:22,028
- Really?
- Yes.

837
00:59:22,128 --> 00:59:26,007
The soil there is the hardest
for tomatoes to survive on,

838
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:27,907
which made them that way.

839
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:31,077
How so? It's not the best condition to grow.

840
00:59:31,938 --> 00:59:33,307
That's exactly why.

841
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:36,818
Trying to survive the toughest terms...

842
00:59:37,418 --> 00:59:41,188
makes them tastier and richer.

843
00:59:42,987 --> 00:59:44,157
I see.

844
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:48,958
You know how fruits...

845
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:52,128
that aren't conventionally
pretty taste sweeter.

846
00:59:54,197 --> 00:59:55,798
I'm sure that's the case with people too.

847
00:59:58,467 --> 01:00:00,338
Are you trying to tell me that I'm ugly?

848
01:00:00,907 --> 01:00:01,967
Yes.

849
01:00:03,278 --> 01:00:06,478
I'm only joking. I guess
I don't know everything,

850
01:00:08,907 --> 01:00:10,947
but you're stronger than you think you are.

851
01:00:13,847 --> 01:00:15,048
You're even stronger than me.

852
01:00:22,028 --> 01:00:25,057
I'm going to try and be stronger now too.

853
01:00:54,688 --> 01:00:56,498
Why on earth am I here?

854
01:00:59,327 --> 01:01:02,298
They fit perfectly. You can
walk toward me in these.

855
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:04,737
I'll be good to you.

856
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:06,637
So be with me, Joon Woo.

857
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,048
My two feet...

858
01:01:13,978 --> 01:01:15,978
keep walking toward you, Hee Kyung.

859
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:29,827
Oh, no.

860
01:01:34,998 --> 01:01:36,938
- Hee Kyung.
- Hey.

861
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:39,307
What brings you by my office?

862
01:01:39,307 --> 01:01:41,307
Your agency's being sued for various charges.

863
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:44,208
Are you heading home?

864
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:46,878
You get hungry around this time of the day.

865
01:01:47,447 --> 01:01:49,048
Why don't we grab some dinner?

866
01:01:49,278 --> 01:01:51,378
I don't see why I'd go to dinner with you.

867
01:01:51,717 --> 01:01:55,088
Why can't you? It's not like
I'm asking you out again.

868
01:01:55,117 --> 01:01:57,257
It's only an innocent meal.

869
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:59,188
Wait, are you seeing someone?

870
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:00,628
A boyfriend?

871
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:09,168
Of course not.

872
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:13,108
For a year, I won't be able to say that I do.

873
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:15,938
Sure, let's grab dinner. Where should we go?

874
01:02:15,938 --> 01:02:18,278
You like spicy food, so how about that?

875
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:19,347
Sounds good.

876
01:02:28,018 --> 01:02:29,018
Thank you.

877
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:15,798
Are you all right?

878
01:03:15,798 --> 01:03:21,208
LIM JU KYUNG

879
01:03:27,507 --> 01:03:28,878
Is Lim Ju Kyung all right?

880
01:03:28,878 --> 01:03:31,818
LEE SOO HO

881
01:03:31,818 --> 01:03:33,248
The video was taken down.

882
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:36,688
LEE SOO HO

883
01:03:48,168 --> 01:03:49,568
Are you going to skip school tomorrow?

884
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:53,208
My mom offered to let me transfer schools.

885
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,367
What?

886
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:56,537
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

887
01:03:56,978 --> 01:03:59,278
I doubt we have any money to move again.

888
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:04,918
I don't want to go back in there.

889
01:04:06,148 --> 01:04:08,148
Seeing how heartbroken my mom is upsets me,

890
01:04:08,548 --> 01:04:11,088
and I feel sorry for doing this to her.

891
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,028
So you'll stay out all night?

892
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:17,128
I wouldn't mind that.

893
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:20,998
I'll head inside.

894
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:24,137
Wait.

895
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,137
Here.

896
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:33,507
It's up to you...

897
01:04:33,907 --> 01:04:37,577
to make sure that Ju Kyung
sleeps without worrying tonight.

898
01:04:48,327 --> 01:04:50,327
- I'll see you tomorrow then.
- Sure.

899
01:04:51,298 --> 01:04:52,967
I'll head inside now.

900
01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:23,498
BOYFRIEND

901
01:05:23,498 --> 01:05:24,597
JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.

902
01:05:36,068 --> 01:05:40,248
I love you so much, oh dear

903
01:05:40,248 --> 01:05:43,918
You're too pretty, what do I do?

904
01:05:43,918 --> 01:05:46,117
How about a smile?

905
01:05:46,347 --> 01:05:47,818
I'd love to see it

906
01:05:48,018 --> 01:05:50,487
Just smile for me

907
01:06:00,268 --> 01:06:03,967
You're too pretty, what do I do?

908
01:06:04,197 --> 01:06:07,137
I love it that you smiled

909
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:08,637
Oh, dear

910
01:06:28,587 --> 01:06:32,828
I love you so much, oh dear

911
01:06:32,828 --> 01:06:37,167
You're too pretty, what do I do?

912
01:06:37,268 --> 01:06:39,398
Just smile for me

913
01:06:39,398 --> 01:06:40,837
I'd love to see it

914
01:06:48,578 --> 01:06:52,917
I love you so much, oh dear

915
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:56,887
You're too pretty, what do I do?

916
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:59,217
How about a smile?

917
01:06:59,217 --> 01:07:00,587
I'd love to see it

918
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:03,158
Just smile for me

919
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:05,057
Giggle

920
01:07:18,908 --> 01:07:20,247
I guess he's gone.

921
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:27,717
Soo Ho.

922
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:36,528
What are you doing outside?

923
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:39,297
What's this?

924
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:42,768
I'll be off now.

925
01:07:48,538 --> 01:07:50,137
You should go back inside.
You'll catch a cold.

926
01:07:50,238 --> 01:07:51,307
Okay.

927
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:53,377
Good night.

928
01:07:54,978 --> 01:07:56,007
Good night.

929
01:08:46,467 --> 01:08:48,398
It may not be easy right now,

930
01:08:49,228 --> 01:08:52,097
but I think it'll be nice to talk it out.

931
01:08:58,438 --> 01:09:01,948
I'm leaving the country soon and
would like to see you before I do.

932
01:09:02,908 --> 01:09:05,448
I don't want you to regret anything.

933
01:09:16,898 --> 01:09:18,028
Thank you.

934
01:09:34,078 --> 01:09:35,207
Hey, Soo Ho.

935
01:09:35,278 --> 01:09:38,318
I'm in front of your place. Are you home?

936
01:09:38,318 --> 01:09:39,478
My place?

937
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:43,788
- You're in front of my place?
- Yes.

938
01:09:43,988 --> 01:09:46,757
My goodness, I'm at the airport.

939
01:09:47,087 --> 01:09:49,427
I'll be in the States for a while.

940
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:52,927
- The reporters in Korea...
- When are you coming back?

941
01:09:53,328 --> 01:09:55,597
I need to take care of
some stuff at the office,

942
01:09:55,597 --> 01:09:57,337
so I'll be back next month.

943
01:10:00,307 --> 01:10:01,467
Soo Ho.

944
01:10:03,578 --> 01:10:07,478
How would you like to live
with me in the States?

945
01:10:08,108 --> 01:10:09,578
You can study music there.

946
01:10:09,578 --> 01:10:10,717
No, I'm not interested.

947
01:10:10,978 --> 01:10:12,417
Let's meet when you come back.

948
01:10:13,148 --> 01:10:14,347
You can...

949
01:10:16,148 --> 01:10:17,587
buy me something delicious.

950
01:10:20,427 --> 01:10:22,688
- I'll hang up now.
- Soo Ho.

951
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:28,127
Okay, I'll see you when I come back to Korea.

952
01:10:41,307 --> 01:10:42,507
- Mr. Kang.
- Yes?

953
01:10:42,507 --> 01:10:43,717
Have a restaurant booked...

954
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:45,018
- the day I come back to Korea.
- Okay, sir.

955
01:10:45,278 --> 01:10:46,917
Actually, never mind. I'll book it.

956
01:10:47,518 --> 01:10:49,587
Just tell me what kids like these days.

957
01:10:49,688 --> 01:10:50,788
Okay, sir.

958
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,618
- Is that Lee Joo Hun?
- Isn't that Lee Joo Hun?

959
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:02,097
Come and eat breakfast.

960
01:11:02,698 --> 01:11:04,438
Gosh, it smells amazing.

961
01:11:04,837 --> 01:11:06,438
Did the smell seep into your room?

962
01:11:06,438 --> 01:11:08,038
Yes, is it someone's birthday today?

963
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:10,337
No, it's for Ju Kyung.

964
01:11:10,438 --> 01:11:12,337
She hasn't eaten for days.

965
01:11:14,778 --> 01:11:18,347
I see you cooked bulgogi,
Ju Kyung's favorite.

966
01:11:19,278 --> 01:11:21,387
There's even japchae.

967
01:11:21,387 --> 01:11:24,717
Gosh, Mom cooked Ju Kyung's favorite dishes!

968
01:11:30,757 --> 01:11:31,858
Ju Bal.

969
01:11:31,858 --> 01:11:34,728
DO NOT ENTER

970
01:11:34,728 --> 01:11:37,297
Ju Kyung, come down and eat.

971
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:40,408
Ju Kyung?

972
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:44,807
Ju Bal, why aren't you answering?

973
01:11:46,847 --> 01:11:49,207
What? When did she leave?

974
01:12:05,297 --> 01:12:06,728
- My gosh.
- Seriously?

975
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,177
She came looking like that?

976
01:12:38,097 --> 01:12:39,358
She has no makeup on.

977
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:40,698
She's wearing no makeup?

978
01:12:52,978 --> 01:12:54,148
Hey, look.

979
01:12:57,518 --> 01:12:58,618
Seriously?

980
01:12:59,217 --> 01:13:00,417
She's so brave.

981
01:13:13,057 --> 01:13:14,097
She has no makeup on.

982
01:13:14,828 --> 01:13:16,097
Look at her.

983
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:31,847
Hey, Ju Kyung.

984
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:33,318
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

985
01:13:34,217 --> 01:13:36,188
Ju Kyung, you're amazing.

986
01:13:36,188 --> 01:13:37,717
I admire you so much.

987
01:13:41,658 --> 01:13:42,957
Soo Ah.

988
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:46,427
Soo Ah! Soo Ah!

989
01:13:46,528 --> 01:13:47,728
Where are you going?

990
01:13:47,728 --> 01:13:48,797
Soo Ah!

991
01:13:49,427 --> 01:13:51,568
Soo Ah! Soo Ah!

992
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:53,307
Soo Ah!

993
01:14:00,807 --> 01:14:03,478
Hey, I heard Ju Kyung came
to school with no makeup on.

994
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:05,318
Where does she get that confidence from?

995
01:14:05,318 --> 01:14:07,587
But do you really think she's dating Soo Ho?

996
01:14:07,587 --> 01:14:08,788
I saw her with no makeup on earlier,

997
01:14:08,788 --> 01:14:10,158
and she looked worse than in the photo.

998
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:12,087
I bet they broke up after
he saw her bare face.

999
01:14:12,257 --> 01:14:13,757
Who would date a girl like her?

1000
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:15,957
Isn't Soo Ho a little out
of it these days as well?

1001
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:17,497
Remember what happened to his dad?

1002
01:14:17,497 --> 01:14:19,997
He must be dating anyone because
he's not in his right mind.

1003
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,398
I can't believe you said that.

1004
01:14:21,898 --> 01:14:23,667
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1005
01:14:24,898 --> 01:14:25,997
Seriously?

1006
01:14:26,097 --> 01:14:27,368
Hey, look.

1007
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:42,788
Hey, you!

1008
01:14:44,658 --> 01:14:45,957
Take back what you just said.

1009
01:14:46,688 --> 01:14:48,158
- Who are you?
- Who is she?

1010
01:14:48,858 --> 01:14:50,127
Ju Kyung?

1011
01:14:51,297 --> 01:14:53,728
You must be nuts to go
around with no makeup on.

1012
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:57,297
Aren't you going to take it
back? Fine. I'm dating Soo Ho.

1013
01:14:57,637 --> 01:14:59,497
Soo Ho is my boyfriend!

1014
01:14:59,497 --> 01:15:00,667
Who is she?

1015
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:03,677
Is that good enough for you?
Does that satisfy your curiosity?

1016
01:15:03,877 --> 01:15:05,578
- She must be nuts.
- Yes, it looks like it.

1017
01:15:06,408 --> 01:15:09,677
He doesn't judge people
based on their appearances.

1018
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:12,247
He likes me for who I am.

1019
01:15:12,578 --> 01:15:15,318
He's incomparable to girls like you
who have horrible personalities.

1020
01:15:15,488 --> 01:15:18,488
So don't badmouth him just
because he's dating me.

1021
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:20,028
From now on, come and talk to me in person.

1022
01:15:20,028 --> 01:15:21,828
I'll deal with you myself. Do you understand?

1023
01:15:21,828 --> 01:15:23,858
- She's amazing.
- She's so brave.

1024
01:15:24,757 --> 01:15:27,368
And if you have time to
judge other people's looks,

1025
01:15:27,368 --> 01:15:28,868
why don't you use that
time to study a bit more?

1026
01:15:28,868 --> 01:15:30,637
Do you know which king
comes after King Sejong?

1027
01:15:30,738 --> 01:15:32,497
- I bet you don't!
- Isn't it Sin Saimdang?

1028
01:15:32,837 --> 01:15:34,807
You're so dumb. Get out of my way.

1029
01:16:35,997 --> 01:16:37,877
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE HAN
WI FOR HIS APPEARANCE.

1030
01:17:01,228 --> 01:17:02,758
EPILOGUE

1031
01:17:02,758 --> 01:17:04,697
I'm hungry.

1032
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:07,367
Hey. Should we get tteokbokki?

1033
01:17:07,598 --> 01:17:08,668
- Okay.
- Okay.

1034
01:17:09,397 --> 01:17:10,668
Hey.

1035
01:17:12,768 --> 01:17:14,537
Can I join you?

1036
01:17:14,668 --> 01:17:17,338
What? But you're not our friend.

1037
01:17:18,537 --> 01:17:20,678
- What's her problem?
- I know, right?

1038
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:22,577
Let's go.

1039
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:33,962
COMICS

1040
01:17:34,688 --> 01:17:35,987
Are you crying?

1041
01:17:40,827 --> 01:17:43,897
Is it because the story is scary?

1042
01:17:45,968 --> 01:17:47,668
It's okay. Don't cry.

1043
01:17:47,867 --> 01:17:51,508
It isn't scary at all. Look, I'm a squirrel.

1044
01:17:51,577 --> 01:17:53,647
A squirrel. A squirrel.

1045
01:17:54,647 --> 01:17:57,878
Isn't that funny? Meow. I'm a cat.

1046
01:17:58,077 --> 01:18:00,418
Meow. I'm a cat. Meow. I'm a cat.

1047
01:18:02,518 --> 01:18:05,588
You're smiling. I'm a squirrel.

1048
01:18:05,588 --> 01:18:06,987
I'm a squirrel.

1049
01:18:07,428 --> 01:18:11,558
Did you know? If you cry then
laugh, you'll get a hairy butt!

1050
01:18:12,758 --> 01:18:16,228
I'm a squirrel. A squirrel.

1051
01:18:29,308 --> 01:18:31,855
TRUE BEAUTY

1052
01:18:32,317 --> 01:18:34,647
<i>I'll only listen to people who like me.</i>

1053
01:18:35,247 --> 01:18:37,487
<i>I won't run away or hide anymore.</i>

1054
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:41,258
<i>Ju Kyung, did you see the
post on the Community?</i>

1055
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:43,897
<i>How will Soo Jin show her
face around school now?</i>

1056
01:18:44,357 --> 01:18:47,468
<i>Can I tell Ju Kyung how I feel?</i>

1057
01:18:48,027 --> 01:18:49,098
<i>What?</i>

1058
01:18:50,938 --> 01:18:52,138
<i>Ju Kyung!</i>

1059
01:18:53,138 --> 01:18:54,537
<i>Why didn't you answer your phone last night?</i>

1060
01:18:55,838 --> 01:18:56,978
<i>Soo Ho!</i>

1061
01:18:56,978 --> 01:18:59,577
<i>Where are you going? Why
are you running away?</i>

1062
01:18:59,737 --> 01:19:01,777
<i>Let's break up.</i>
