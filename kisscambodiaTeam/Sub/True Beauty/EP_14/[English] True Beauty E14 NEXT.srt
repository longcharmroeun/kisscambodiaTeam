EPISODE 14

2
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:31,878
I heard Ju Kyung came to school...

3
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:33,417
- with no makeup on.
- But do you really think...

4
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:35,077
she's dating Soo Ho?

5
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:36,247
I saw her with no makeup on earlier,

6
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:37,518
and she looked worse than in the photo.

7
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:39,018
I bet they broke up after
he saw her bare face.

8
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:40,057
Who would date a girl like her?

9
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,557
Isn't Soo Ho a little out
of it these days as well?

10
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:43,128
Remember what happened to his dad?

11
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:45,598
He must be dating anyone because
he's not in his right mind.

12
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:46,958
I can't believe you said that.

13
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:48,827
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

14
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,497
- Seriously?
- Hey, look.

15
00:01:59,107 --> 00:02:00,307
Hey, you!

16
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,777
- Take back what you just said.
- Ju Kyung?

17
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:07,777
You must be nuts to go
around with no makeup on.

18
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:10,148
Fine. I'm dating Soo Ho.

19
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:12,287
Soo Ho is my boyfriend!

20
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:14,388
Is that good enough for you?
Does that satisfy your curiosity?

21
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:16,057
- She must be nuts.
- Yes, it looks like it.

22
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:19,997
He doesn't judge people
based on their appearances.

23
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:22,467
He likes me for who I am.

24
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:25,668
He's incomparable to girls like you
who have horrible personalities.

25
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:28,698
So don't badmouth him just
because he's dating me.

26
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,407
From now on, come and talk to me in person.

27
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:32,337
I'll deal with you myself. Do you understand?

28
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:34,638
And if you have time to
judge other people's looks,

29
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:36,307
why don't you use that
time to study a bit more?

30
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:37,948
Get out of my way.

31
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,217
They must really be dating.

32
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,358
I'm so jealous.

33
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:33,398
Let's go.

34
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:46,817
Hey, you're here.

35
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:49,187
- What should we eat today?
- Tteokbokki!

36
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,988
- I know a good place nearby.
- Really? Let's go there.

37
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,587
A boyfriend? Of course not.

38
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,777
This is a sweet ride you have.

39
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,247
- Your career must be going strong.
- Do you like it?

40
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:19,377
Yes.

41
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:21,247
Do you want it?

42
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,348
How cute.

43
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:30,257
From this moment on, you'll be my grapefruit.

44
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,267
But I'm her grapefruit!

45
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:42,067
My heart nearly jumped out of my chest.

46
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,437
I'd love to eat a grapefruit.

47
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,877
I love grapefruit, that's all.

48
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:56,588
Are they really dating? Lucky her.

49
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:00,618
Us dating is no longer a secret.

50
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:05,088
Yes. Today's the day I reveal
my relationship with you...

51
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:06,728
and my bare face.

52
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:08,957
Are you all right?

53
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:10,627
No.

54
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:13,437
My heart shriveled to the size of a bean.

55
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:15,908
Then why didn't you put on makeup as usual?

56
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,108
Go Woon once said to me,

57
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:25,278
if I hate how I look just
because others tease me,

58
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:28,178
it's the same as admitting that I'm a loser.

59
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:31,348
So from now on,

60
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,788
I'm only going to listen
to people who like me.

61
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:38,827
I won't care about whatever
people say about me...

62
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:40,928
when they know about me.

63
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:44,298
I won't ever run away or hide again.

64
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:45,868
That's why I'm here wearing my bare face.

65
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:48,897
I see you've all grown up.

66
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:55,947
Yes, Mom. Ju Kyung's fine. The
Divine Soo Ho is by her side.

67
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:57,978
What? The Divine Soo Ho?

68
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:58,978
So don't worry.

69
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,218
Are you sure no one's bullying
her? I don't need to go, right?

70
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:03,817
Okay.

71
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:05,858
Is Ju Kyung doing okay?

72
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:08,158
Ju Young says she looks okay,

73
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:10,127
but who knows how she
might be feeling inside?

74
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:12,798
She'll be fine. She's your daughter.

75
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:18,668
Why are you here?

76
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,897
Just go!

77
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:22,807
Gosh.

78
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,137
- Go! Leave!
- What's he doing?

79
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,738
- Go!
- Is he talking to us?

80
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:31,447
Stop trying to sway me, and just leave!

81
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:33,317
Go!

82
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:34,747
What kind of a lunatic...

83
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,418
Mr. Han?

84
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:41,257
"Mr. Han"?

85
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,488
Hello.

86
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:48,127
You're not allowed to park here.

87
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,127
So seeing this car parked here...

88
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:52,428
makes me feel sad.

89
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:54,838
Goodbye.

90
00:06:57,267 --> 00:07:00,238
Who gets so angry over a parked car?

91
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:01,637
Does he have anger management problems?

92
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,678
No, he has cuteness management problems.

93
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:08,478
Gosh, look.

94
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,288
- My gosh.
- Unbelievable.

95
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:17,288
- My gosh.
- Seriously?

96
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:18,428
They're so cute.

97
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,897
- Did you see that?
- My gosh.

98
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:24,497
I can't believe this.

99
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,267
My gosh.

100
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:30,108
They're unbelievable.

101
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:35,978
My gosh, I'm so jealous of her.

102
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,488
Ju Kyung, I worried about you a lot.

103
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:46,718
You were really cool earlier.

104
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:52,528
- Hello.
- Hello.

105
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:54,627
Let's go home now, guys.

106
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,928
Mr. Han, school just started.

107
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:58,168
Yes, I know.

108
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,738
- What?
- What?

109
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:04,338
You're not supposed to be in
our class, so please leave.

110
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,207
Mr. Han, she's Lim Ju Kyung.

111
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,377
Yes, I know.

112
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,877
- Ju Kyung?
- Yes?

113
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:12,408
Ju Kyung, is that you?

114
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:14,647
- Yes.
- Ju Kyung...

115
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:17,387
Ju Kyung, I'm so glad you're back.

116
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:19,557
I mean...

117
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:24,228
I was... I was so...

118
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:26,858
I was so worried about you.

119
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,127
- My gosh.
- Is he crying?

120
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:31,428
Don't cry!

121
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,497
My gosh.

122
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:33,798
Don't cry, Mr. Han.

123
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,938
Is he really crying?

124
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,907
I'm sorry, guys.

125
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,177
I just can't believe Ju
Kyung is finally back.

126
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:44,078
- Don't cry! Don't cry!
- Don't cry! Don't cry!

127
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,808
- Cheer up!
- Don't cry!

128
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,147
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:49,948
That's it for today.

130
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:52,488
Don't cry, Mr. Han.

131
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:04,267
I can't believe you thought
of coming to school like that.

132
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:06,968
What?

133
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:11,108
Are you trying to put on a show
in front of everyone in school?

134
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:16,708
Were you so desperate to attract attention?

135
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:21,177
Have you suddenly become brave
now that you're dating Soo Ho?

136
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:24,318
Soo Jin!

137
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:28,657
Are you serious?

138
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,058
- Soo Ah.
- Soo Jin.

139
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,497
You're the worst.

140
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:36,667
You should be apologizing to her on
your knees. But what did you say?

141
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,228
Did you seriously just say that to her?

142
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,997
Why should I apologize?

143
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,968
Because you were the one who
uploaded her photos and video.

144
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:46,708
- What's going on?
- Hey, stop him.

145
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,078
- That's not good.
- Should we stop him?

146
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:49,808
- Shouldn't we stop him?
- What's going on?

147
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,147
- You want me to stop him?
- Go on.

148
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:52,448
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

149
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:53,647
I bet you think...

150
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:56,948
you destroyed Ju Kyung by doing this.

151
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,017
But you just destroyed yourself.

152
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:13,397
At first, I tried to understand.

153
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:16,667
I figured you might've gotten angry
because you had feelings for Soo Ho.

154
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,407
So I thought you'd at least
be regretting it right now.

155
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:22,137
Ju Kyung wasn't coming to school,

156
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:23,877
so I thought you'd feel bad about it...

157
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:26,118
and be worried about her.

158
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:27,877
So...

159
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:30,887
I waited for you to apologize to her.

160
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,688
But were you always such a horrible person?

161
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,558
Yes.

162
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:39,358
It turns out I was.

163
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,838
Soo Ah!

164
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:09,257
Soo Ah!

165
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:18,667
Soo Jin.

166
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,037
Why do you keep crossing the line?

167
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,767
Is there something going on at home?

168
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:25,507
Is it because of your dad?

169
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:27,438
What does it matter to you?

170
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:29,747
I just can't seem to understand.

171
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:32,007
You were never like this.

172
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:35,848
Is this what you really want?

173
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:39,688
- Yes.
- I know you're lying.

174
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:41,387
I know you're also going to regret it.

175
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:42,988
So it's not too late.

176
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:45,287
Go and apologize to Ju Kyung.

177
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:48,397
- Apologize and...
- Don't tell me what to do.

178
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,108
Soo Ah.

179
00:11:58,068 --> 00:11:59,677
Soo Ah, wait.

180
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:04,377
Soo Ah, I'm sorry.

181
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:05,478
Let go of me.

182
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:09,478
I'm so sorry for not telling you.

183
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:14,188
But I was worried we might no
longer be friends if I told you.

184
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:19,958
Ju Kyung, what did you take me for?

185
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:22,198
Did you even think of me as your best friend?

186
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,927
That's why I couldn't tell you.

187
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,938
But you told Soo Jin.

188
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:31,407
You told her everything,
but you kept me in the dark.

189
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:35,777
You thought I'd turn my back on you
if you showed me your bare face?

190
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,277
I know I may seem a little
thoughtless at times,

191
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:42,647
but how could you think I'd be so shallow?

192
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,887
I'm sorry, Soo Ah.

193
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,558
I was so eager to help you get a boyfriend,

194
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:55,027
but you didn't even tell
me you were dating Soo Ho.

195
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:59,527
Did I have to find out about him
through the online school community?

196
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:02,397
I'm sorry, Soo Ah.

197
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:16,988
What do you think made her become like that?

198
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:19,147
Nothing made her become like that.

199
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:21,417
She just chose to be that kind of person.

200
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:24,627
How could she do that to you?

201
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,297
Soo Jin let go of our hand.

202
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,468
I guess we didn't mean...

203
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:35,267
anything to her.

204
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:43,478
Let me look at you properly.

205
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:45,978
Why did you try so hard
to keep it a secret...

206
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,387
You'll become prettier once
you take care of your skin.

207
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,257
Start going to the dermatologist,

208
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:57,488
drink a lot of water, and
start taking vitamins.

209
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:58,958
Then it'll get better. Don't worry.

210
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:03,698
And you'd better tell me
everything from the start.

211
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:05,167
When did you and Soo Ho
start dating each other?

212
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,997
Who was the first person to
confess? Is he nice to you?

213
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:10,308
Is Lee Soo Ho, that sociopath, mean to you?

214
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:12,868
No, he's not mean to me.

215
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:13,907
You have no right to smile yet.

216
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,777
You need to tell me every little detail.

217
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:17,247
We'll have to stay up all night, okay?

218
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:21,247
What did this mean?

219
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,988
Gosh, take it off already. That's disgusting.

220
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,047
Didn't you give it to
me because you liked me?

221
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,188
What are you talking about?

222
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:29,088
Let me ask you one last time.

223
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:32,558
Don't you feel a little motivated
to let me into your heart?

224
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:35,328
- No, not really.
- No. I want you to prove it.

225
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:38,968
If you really have no
feelings for me whatsoever,

226
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,137
I want you to step on me.

227
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:44,238
Gosh, think about it carefully.

228
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:46,308
I'm asking you this for the last time.

229
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,688
I don't want to stay as his friend
only to like him one-sidedly...

230
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,127
like you're doing with Ju Kyung.

231
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:24,377
Hey, are you okay?

232
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:28,517
Are you crying?

233
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:31,647
I'm sure I didn't hit you that hard.

234
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:32,747
Seo Jun.

235
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:35,118
What am I going to do?

236
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,387
What?

237
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,797
Did you get rejected by Go Woon?

238
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:44,328
I like her so much.

239
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,797
But she doesn't like me at all.

240
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:50,068
My heart flutters every time I see her.

241
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:52,637
So how can I stay friends with her?

242
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:54,938
You're right.

243
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:58,507
I know I'll be really good to
her if I become her boyfriend.

244
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:00,848
Exactly.

245
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:04,747
I never knew how painful it
was to have a crush on someone.

246
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,228
Like I knew?

247
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,797
But do you know something?

248
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:17,267
A person who tries everything has no regrets.

249
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:22,438
Now that I've been rejected
after officially asking her out,

250
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:26,208
I think I can finally move on.

251
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,517
When did you two start dating?

252
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:41,787
It hasn't been very long.

253
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:43,728
Ever since the class trip.

254
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:45,228
Since back then?

255
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:46,458
Why you...

256
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:50,427
Hey. I have a question.

257
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:52,468
When was your first kiss?

258
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:53,968
During the school trip...

259
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:55,968
You idiot.

260
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,838
Why are you asking that?

261
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,838
- What?
- You jerk.

262
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,037
Even I think that's wrong.

263
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:02,777
You guys hate everything I do.

264
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:05,547
"The snow must have tried again and again"

265
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,917
"To make a flower bloom
on the swaying branch"

266
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,717
"It must have knocked again and again"

267
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:16,788
"It must have danced again and again"

268
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:20,758
"It must have slipped hundreds of times"

269
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,477
"Look at the beauty that it
finally succeeded in blooming"

270
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:39,177
"Every spring, the branches burst open"

271
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:42,877
"The most beautiful wounds
from where they were burned"

272
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:45,548
"They burst open"

273
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:49,157
"The most beautiful wounds
from where they were burned"

274
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:51,127
What do you think?

275
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:03,137
- Are you sleepy?
- Yes.

276
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,568
I couldn't sleep much.

277
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:08,477
I'll take a nap in the
music room. You go eat.

278
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:11,977
I can't do that. Wait
there. I'll bring you food.

279
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,618
No, it's okay...

280
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:17,108
What...

281
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:19,008
Hey. You're up.

282
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:20,977
When did you get here?

283
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:23,447
You woke me up.

284
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,147
You must be tired,

285
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:28,717
Soo Ho's cousin.

286
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:33,048
I wasn't trying to lie to you.

287
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:34,358
I wasn't fooled.

288
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,588
You and Soo Ho were so
obvious that you were lying.

289
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:40,298
What? You knew back then?

290
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:47,838
What? What do you want to say?

291
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,407
You don't look that different
with or without makeup.

292
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,538
How could I have been fooled?

293
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:56,207
I don't get it.

294
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:58,808
Thanks.

295
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,278
You're ugly just the same.

296
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:02,748
Stop teasing me.

297
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,217
I heard you made them...

298
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,217
take down my video.

299
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:13,127
Thanks.

300
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:15,657
No problem.

301
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,085
How cute. I'm so jealous.

302
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,885
I wish I had a girlfriend too.

303
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:32,155
Are you going on a date today?

304
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:35,294
Where to? Want me to tell you
some of the best date spots?

305
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,694
I know how to run searches too.

306
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:39,895
Those places are all advertisements.

307
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:43,534
Most of them are places
that girls can't stand.

308
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:46,135
This guy knows absolutely
nothing about dating.

309
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:48,234
Really?

310
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,774
Let's see which places he looked up.

311
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:53,845
Let's see.

312
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:58,244
What do you think?

313
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:01,355
- Not bad.
- Not bad.

314
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:03,524
- You did well.
- He says you did well.

315
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:07,294
- Hold on. Wait. What is this?
- I love you so much

316
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:08,855
Oh dear

317
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:11,125
You're too pretty

318
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,764
- Oh my gosh.
- Hey.

319
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:16,734
You cutie pie.

320
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,464
You have everything planned.

321
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:20,504
Hard on the outside, soft on the inside.

322
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:22,075
- Right?
- A total softy.

323
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:23,944
- Oh dear
- Oh dear

324
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,105
- Oh dear
- Quiet.

325
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:28,514
- Oh dear
- Oh dear

326
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,514
- Our softy.
- Bye.

327
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,284
- Ju Kyung.
- Oh dear

328
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,044
- Oh dear
- Oh dear

329
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:34,954
- Ju Kyung.
- Yes?

330
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,954
I'm taking Ju Kyung today.

331
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:39,925
Sorry. I'll call you.

332
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,954
Oh no, what will you do?

333
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,224
- Oh dear
- Oh dear

334
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:45,065
We'll play with you

335
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:46,264
- Oh dear
- Oh dear

336
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:49,335
- We'll play with you
- Oh dear

337
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:50,865
- Oh dear
- Oh dear

338
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:55,774
- Oh dear
- Oh dear

339
00:22:58,804 --> 00:22:59,905
Awesome.

340
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:02,815
They look so hot in the cover picture.

341
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:03,885
Awesome.

342
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:07,115
How long has it been since
Crash released a new song?

343
00:23:07,115 --> 00:23:09,315
You look so cute,

344
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:12,425
but you like hard rock? It's so unexpected.

345
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:16,155
- Two corndogs please.
- That looks good.

346
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:18,925
Thank you.

347
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,095
Thank you.

348
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:22,395
Let's go.

349
00:23:22,464 --> 00:23:25,034
- Let's see what's in Hye Min's bag.
- Let's see.

350
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:26,974
- That hurts.
- It hurts?

351
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:28,804
- Will you beat her up for me?
- I'll kill her.

352
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,744
What was that? Did they just
take a kid from our school?

353
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,454
Where are you going?

354
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:46,024
- Ju Kyung!
- I'm starving.

355
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:47,925
Five corndogs please.

356
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,524
Wait for me!

357
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:56,395
Five orders of tteokbokki too.

358
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,304
Darn it.

359
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:01,375
Darn it.

360
00:24:01,504 --> 00:24:02,774
Take this.

361
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:04,075
Flip and kick.

362
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,774
Yes. Take that.

363
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:06,815
When are you guys leaving?

364
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:08,645
Yes! Quiet. After this.

365
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:10,815
This is important. Don't talk to us.

366
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:13,484
- Darn it.
- Darn it!

367
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:17,185
Let's see how much money she has.

368
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:21,194
You said you'd leave me alone.

369
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:22,694
That you'd let me go.

370
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,964
That was if you had dug up dirt...

371
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:27,065
on Ju Kyung.

372
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,165
But you did absolutely nothing.

373
00:24:30,504 --> 00:24:31,534
Am I wrong?

374
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:33,264
Hey, Park Se Mi!

375
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,575
Ju Kyung?

376
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:44,115
It's Dumpling.

377
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:48,355
Good timing. I've been
meaning to go see you anyway.

378
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,355
Let Hye Min go.

379
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:53,625
What if I refuse?

380
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,994
Hye Min, come here.

381
00:24:58,325 --> 00:24:59,625
You're not going anywhere.

382
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:01,835
Look at her.

383
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:06,264
So you're dating Lee Soo Ho while
keeping Han Seo Jun by your side.

384
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:07,974
Our Ju Kyung has grown up.

385
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,605
The video and photos of you
were posted online, right?

386
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,544
Your life is completely ruined.

387
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:18,145
It's not like you can
be reborn though, right?

388
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,444
You!

389
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,694
Darn it.

390
00:25:28,554 --> 00:25:30,764
It must be a death wish that you have.

391
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,794
The ones with the death wish are you three.

392
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:35,764
Take this!

393
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,905
This is an unfair fight!

394
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:39,635
You...

395
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,875
Does your mom know what you're up to?

396
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:44,244
Leave my mom out of this.

397
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:46,444
One, two, three, head!

398
00:25:48,974 --> 00:25:50,714
You've grown some balls, have you?

399
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,454
What on earth do you have in there? It hurts.

400
00:25:56,185 --> 00:25:58,024
You little cheeky...

401
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:00,954
You're dead meat!

402
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:13,135
Left... And right leg...

403
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,635
Punch!

404
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:16,804
- And that.
- Hey, give me a chance.

405
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,244
Are you seriously hitting me?

406
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,244
Okay!

407
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:28,155
You big fat dumpling!

408
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:31,925
How dare you.

409
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,554
Take that.

410
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:36,425
- And that!
- All right.

411
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,794
Nice!

412
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:42,935
Give me that.

413
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:46,635
You think you can take me on?

414
00:26:46,635 --> 00:26:48,004
Challenge accepted.

415
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:49,435
- Bring it on.
- Go get him.

416
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:50,845
Go, Soo Ho.

417
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,024
You!

418
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,794
What? Wait!

419
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:12,895
That's it. Nice one!

420
00:27:20,504 --> 00:27:21,675
- You won.
- Okay!

421
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:24,875
Soo Ho!

422
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,645
Take that, Hyun Kyu.

423
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:31,345
- That hurts.
- Let go, darn it.

424
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,585
- Let go of me.
- Let go!

425
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:36,815
What is all this? Get away from her!

426
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:39,385
Unbelievable.

427
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,325
- Let go of me.
- You jerk...

428
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,865
Hey, brother.

429
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:51,105
Who do you think you are coming
at students of Saebom High?

430
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:58,175
I'll take care of things, so get going.

431
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:09,484
So...

432
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,784
Thanks, Ju Kyung.

433
00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:13,454
Don't ever go with them again.

434
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:15,895
Just call the police if
they try to drag you away.

435
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:19,425
Got it. Anyway, Se Mi
doesn't scare me anymore.

436
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:21,165
She seemed beatable back there.

437
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:24,835
I don't know why I've been so scared of her.

438
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:26,665
I should've stood up for myself sooner.

439
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:30,175
I know. I should've done that sooner too.

440
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:37,845
Oh, no. I just got this today!

441
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:40,954
I'm sorry for not being able to protect you.

442
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:42,254
I bet it hurt.

443
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:45,085
- Oh, no.
- Unbelievable.

444
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:46,984
Would you like to have this instead?

445
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,454
I normally buy two, you see.

446
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:52,794
Really? You're giving this to me?

447
00:28:52,794 --> 00:28:54,794
Thank you so much!

448
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:57,065
The snacks will be on me, okay?

449
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:02,835
By the way, are you perhaps
a member of Gelatin?

450
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:05,744
Yes, a third-generation
Gelatin. What about you?

451
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:08,145
- Me too. No way!
- Really?

452
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:09,615
It's so good to meet you.

453
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,145
Did you manage to buy tickets...

454
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:13,244
- for the year-end concert?
- Yes, in section A.

455
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:14,784
No way. Me, too!

456
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:17,784
- Really?
- We can go together!

457
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:19,685
I can't believe it.

458
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,194
It's pretty, isn't it?

459
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,865
What a waste though.

460
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:27,595
It was a memory I never wanted to remember.

461
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,704
But what's different now...

462
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:33,764
is that I'm not alone anymore.

463
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:46,484
But it's late.

464
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,085
Are you having fun?

465
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,784
Have you had dinner?

466
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:54,395
You haven't been answering my calls.

467
00:29:54,855 --> 00:29:56,024
Should I pick you up?

468
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,565
It's quite late, you know.

469
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:01,565
- You...
- Sure are...

470
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:02,794
The clingy type.

471
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:07,504
Just eat instead of peeking at my phone.

472
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:10,744
Let her have fun and relieve stress.

473
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:13,204
There's no need be like a stalker, you know.

474
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:15,575
She'll call once she finds the time.

475
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:17,284
You're obsessing.

476
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,645
- But I'm worried.
- You worry me more.

477
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,855
I was like this too during the early stages.

478
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:25,024
I'd call and text her
whenever I found a moment.

479
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,494
She nearly dumped me after a week.

480
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:29,954
Soo Ah said...

481
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:33,125
I was making her grow sick and tired of me.

482
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:35,165
- What?
- Even though...

483
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:36,635
you love her endlessly,

484
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:39,234
- don't let it show all at once.
- don't let it show all at once.

485
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:42,405
That's how she won't get sick of you.

486
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:43,504
Exactly.

487
00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:45,244
Wait, you should write this down.

488
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,875
Go home now, okay?

489
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:49,845
- Why?
- We haven't finished the chicken.

490
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:58,585
Soo Ah, are you having fun?

491
00:30:58,585 --> 00:31:00,925
I've been missing you like crazy!

492
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:05,464
Sure thing, darling. I'll
be there to pick you up.

493
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:10,034
Don't make her get sick and tired of you.

494
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,905
Soo Ho, I may not be an expert of dating,

495
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:17,274
- but it seems to me that..
- Aren't you leaving too?

496
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:21,514
I'll pick up my pace.

497
00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:45,605
I should call Soo Ho.

498
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,135
No.

499
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,534
No...

500
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:40,925
Soo Ah?

501
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:47,365
Seriously? At this hour?

502
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,595
Text me, will you?

503
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:49,935
I think my phone's busted.

504
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,804
No, it's fine. It's working just fine!

505
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:54,905
If it weren't, how would you
have been able to call me?

506
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:56,304
By the looks of it,

507
00:32:56,304 --> 00:32:57,944
I can make calls, but not receive them.

508
00:32:57,944 --> 00:32:58,974
You're making me feel sick and tired of you.

509
00:32:58,974 --> 00:33:01,075
Just go to sleep before you kill me too.

510
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:02,315
Hey, but...

511
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:03,774
Unbelievable.

512
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:06,284
Yoo Tae Hoon!

513
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,195
Could he still be asleep?

514
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:35,445
GIRLFRIEND

515
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:52,324
I already mopped the floor today, so save it.

516
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:55,165
You already work hard, so I wanted to help.

517
00:33:55,565 --> 00:33:57,565
- Is there anything I can do?
- No.

518
00:33:57,565 --> 00:33:58,935
Still, Mom.

519
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:00,775
I'll tidy that up for you.

520
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:02,275
You're only giving me a headache, so go home.

521
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,344
Mom, you see,

522
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,915
- I...
- Ju Kyung,

523
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:11,884
check under the chair.

524
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:14,215
What? Why?

525
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:16,185
Just do as you're told, will you?

526
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:23,324
What's this?

527
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:28,864
Mom!

528
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:31,835
To get certified, you need to
pass a performance test too.

529
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,005
It also requires a lot of equipment,

530
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,505
so how can you possibly pay
for it all working part-time?

531
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,375
Are you saying you approve of me...

532
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:41,074
studying makeup?

533
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:42,415
Quit that part-time job too.

534
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,114
Now that you've made up your mind,

535
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:47,045
put in your hardest work...

536
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,985
and be as popular as that Selena you like.

537
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:51,384
Got it?

538
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,784
Mom!

539
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:56,494
Stop it. This isn't cute, you know.

540
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,125
I promise I'll do my best, Mom.

541
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:00,695
I love you, Mom.

542
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:03,565
Gosh, you're tickling me.

543
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:05,965
- Goodness, get off me already.
- Thank you.

544
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,335
- My gosh, it tickles so much.
- Thank you.

545
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:10,534
Stop it!

546
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:13,145
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

547
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,844
- What?
- Why didn't you pick up yesterday?

548
00:35:16,844 --> 00:35:19,315
I was out having fun. Why
are you being so clingy?

549
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:20,715
You're always calling me and texting me.

550
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,585
I want a little freedom.

551
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:27,525
What's that supposed to mean? Are
you saying we should break up?

552
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,695
You're really exhausting.

553
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:33,295
What did you say?

554
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:39,304
I'm not like him. What do you
say? Do you want to hop on?

555
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:41,235
- Sure.
- Don't go.

556
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:43,005
Don't go. Don't go.

557
00:35:43,904 --> 00:35:44,904
Ju Kyung.

558
00:35:46,174 --> 00:35:47,244
Ju Kyung!

559
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,085
No!

560
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,125
MISSED CALL: GIRLFRIEND

561
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,994
What? She called me?

562
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:05,965
What a lousy dream.

563
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,514
GIRLFRIEND

564
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:27,185
- Hello?
- Last night...

565
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,185
What time did you go home?

566
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,415
Why didn't you call me on your way home?

567
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:31,025
I'm not asking for an apology.

568
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:33,384
But you should've called. I waited all night.

569
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:35,295
Hearing your voice makes
me miss you even more.

570
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:37,594
Let's meet up and talk. I
was just about to go see you.

571
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,195
- You...
- Sure are...

572
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:40,264
The clingy type.

573
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:43,565
Where are you?

574
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,404
My class is about to start.
I'll call you after I'm done.

575
00:36:46,764 --> 00:36:48,634
What? But...

576
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:58,315
Hello, everyone.

577
00:36:58,315 --> 00:36:59,884
- Hello.
- Hello.

578
00:36:59,945 --> 00:37:01,954
You need to take into consideration...

579
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:04,054
that the human face is three dimensional.

580
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:07,724
Highlight the parts that
are more prominent...

581
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:09,125
by applying a thicker base.

582
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:13,165
And the skin is thinner
around the eyes and mouth,

583
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:15,134
so you need to apply a thinner base...

584
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:17,094
to prevent it from looking
too flat. Do you agree?

585
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,065
- Yes.
- Now try it on your partners.

586
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:20,264
- Okay.
- Okay.

587
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:34,815
Hello, I'm the person
you called. Where is he?

588
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:36,884
Over there. He's knocked out.

589
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:38,525
- Thank you.
- No problem.

590
00:37:43,154 --> 00:37:44,494
Joon Woo.

591
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:47,295
Wake up. Grapefruit.

592
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:49,594
Grapefruit. Grapefruit.

593
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:51,764
Did you call me?

594
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:57,375
Hey, it's my girl.

595
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:58,574
Goodness.

596
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:02,945
Or are you not my girl anymore?

597
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:05,215
After all, we've broken up.

598
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,244
My goodness.

599
00:38:10,485 --> 00:38:12,284
What can I do to make you mine?

600
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:13,985
Unbelievable.

601
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,424
Don't think about running
away. You just wait.

602
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:23,195
I'll make you mine again after a year.

603
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:35,474
I can't believe this man.

604
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,806
INSTANT NOODLES, BUY 1 GET 1 FREE

605
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,795
I picked them up first.

606
00:38:53,494 --> 00:38:55,094
- What...
- Let go.

607
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:02,704
Okay. After you.

608
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:04,605
- Whatever.
- You can take them.

609
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:10,074
Why does he look so familiar?

610
00:39:11,085 --> 00:39:13,114
- Honey, try this.
- Co...

611
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:15,415
- Take a bite.
- Columbus Park!

612
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:17,154
Stop right there!

613
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,855
- What... What...
- Hey, you.

614
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:20,125
- It's Columbus Park.
- Stop!

615
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,695
Hey! Stop! Get over here!

616
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:27,324
There we go.

617
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:29,695
You're too pretty

618
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:32,764
What do I do?

619
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:35,534
What do you do? Just get in the car.

620
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:37,744
Okay, there you go.

621
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:41,674
How were you going to wait for a
year when you can't even last a day?

622
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:43,775
Stop!

623
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,384
- What's that noise?
- Please stop him!

624
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,284
- Please stop him!
- My gosh.

625
00:39:57,965 --> 00:39:59,965
My goodness, thank you.

626
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:01,994
Mom. Dad.

627
00:40:02,264 --> 00:40:03,364
Hee Kyung.

628
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:10,534
Grapefruit.

629
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:21,255
Hey, Soo Ho. Pretty good.

630
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:23,384
Hey, you're here.

631
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,355
Why aren't you on a date? It's the weekend.

632
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:30,054
Ju Kyung's busy.

633
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,824
Are you upset because you guys couldn't meet?

634
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:33,494
I'm not upset.

635
00:40:33,494 --> 00:40:35,364
I wonder why she didn't meet
you even though she's busy.

636
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:38,404
She can't be sick of your looks already.

637
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:41,275
Why would she get sick
of it? Why are you here?

638
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:43,875
No reason. I was just bored.

639
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,074
But why do you learn
martial arts at the dojo?

640
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:47,375
I could've taught you instead.

641
00:40:47,974 --> 00:40:49,074
What do you know?

642
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,284
There's nothing to learn.
Fighting is about instincts.

643
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,284
Instincts, my foot. It's all about skills.

644
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:58,525
Did you see that? It's all about instincts.

645
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,125
No matter how good you may be,

646
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,724
you can never beat someone who
was professionally trained.

647
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:03,824
- What if I take you down?
- What?

648
00:41:03,824 --> 00:41:05,424
What will you do if I
manage to take you down?

649
00:41:06,494 --> 00:41:07,665
You must be really bored.

650
00:41:08,195 --> 00:41:09,835
The first person to take the
other person down is the winner.

651
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:12,034
The loser has to grant the winner a wish.

652
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,335
- What do you say?
- You'll lose everything, you know.

653
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:16,904
Just worry about yourself.

654
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:20,804
No rules. Just a three-second takedown.

655
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,074
Deal.

656
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,415
1, 2,

657
00:41:59,514 --> 00:42:00,884
2.25,

658
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,685
- 2.5...
- You...

659
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:05,154
Are you taking your anger out on me?

660
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:09,424
Three.

661
00:42:14,594 --> 00:42:16,235
Couldn't you let me win?

662
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:21,775
What do you say? Do you
want to take lessons here?

663
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:24,404
Forget it. Gosh, what are
you going to make me do?

664
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:26,474
Hurry up and tell me.

665
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:33,284
I whisper words of love

666
00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:35,815
As if it's natural

667
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:52,864
You walk toward me

668
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:56,904
From afar

669
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:06,945
How am I going to express

670
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:10,855
How much my heart flutters

671
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:13,884
You

672
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:19,264
Stole my heart

673
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:22,565
From the moment we first met

674
00:43:23,264 --> 00:43:29,235
And you gave me an incurable illness

675
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,875
I wish to be your flowerpot

676
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:36,875
I pray every day

677
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:43,154
I wish to be your flowerpot
on your windowsill

678
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,824
I don't care if I can't talk

679
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,195
I don't care that I can't ask for anything

680
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:57,034
All I need is your smile
and care from time to time

681
00:43:57,195 --> 00:44:00,264
I'll be able to see you sleep

682
00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:07,005
For as long as I want

683
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,445
- Encore! Encore!
- That was great.

684
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:16,355
- Here's your pizza.
- Thank you.

685
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,384
I'm never going to make a bet with you again.

686
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,054
- Were you hungry?
- I did Jiu-Jitsu and sang.

687
00:44:23,355 --> 00:44:24,654
Of course, I'm hungry.

688
00:44:24,654 --> 00:44:28,065
By the way, your vocal skills
aren't as good as before.

689
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:32,235
What are you talking about? I
have a more deep and manly voice.

690
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:35,974
Exactly. Why don't you use
that deep and manly voice...

691
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,574
to sing?

692
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:40,704
It's too late.

693
00:44:41,204 --> 00:44:43,014
- It's not too late.
- I'm not interested.

694
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:50,114
I want you to sing again.

695
00:44:52,784 --> 00:44:55,594
I'm sure Se Yeon would want the same thing.

696
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:04,134
What would you have asked for if you had won?

697
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:05,764
Do you want to know?

698
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:07,435
Let's hear it.

699
00:45:09,634 --> 00:45:12,904
I was going to ask you if I
could tell Ju Kyung how I feel.

700
00:45:17,074 --> 00:45:18,545
I wanted to ask for your permission.

701
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:20,384
You did?

702
00:45:20,915 --> 00:45:23,884
Yes. I want to have her reject
me so that I can move on.

703
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:35,034
YOUNG MAN PIZZA

704
00:45:35,594 --> 00:45:37,435
From what he said,

705
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:41,534
it sounded like he got scammed
by Mr. Won and is penniless.

706
00:45:42,074 --> 00:45:44,904
He wouldn't be in Korea if he had money.

707
00:45:44,904 --> 00:45:46,474
He would've fled long ago.

708
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:50,074
Still, since we handed
him over to the police,

709
00:45:50,244 --> 00:45:51,744
he'll pay for what he did.

710
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:55,454
I thought I'd get my money
back if we found him.

711
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:58,054
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

712
00:45:58,585 --> 00:46:01,654
This was fate. Take it as your lot in life.

713
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:06,295
At least we moved away
from Ju Kyung's bullies.

714
00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:09,195
And Hee Kyung ended up meeting her man too.

715
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:10,465
Am I right?

716
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,465
She's right. If Ju Kyung
hadn't transferred to Saebom,

717
00:46:13,465 --> 00:46:15,474
I never would've met my Grapefruit.

718
00:46:15,835 --> 00:46:17,005
But...

719
00:46:18,105 --> 00:46:20,074
when will our Grapefruit wake up?

720
00:46:20,174 --> 00:46:21,474
He keeps sleeping.

721
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:34,284
Did you wait long?

722
00:46:34,855 --> 00:46:35,994
No.

723
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:38,594
I should charge.

724
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,235
Did you order already? It looks good.

725
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:44,034
I ordered it for myself.

726
00:46:46,534 --> 00:46:49,235
What's wrong? Are you mad at me?

727
00:46:49,235 --> 00:46:50,974
- No.
- Then are you annoyed?

728
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,375
No. Do you think I'm the type
to get annoyed over nothing?

729
00:46:55,074 --> 00:46:56,844
You're obviously annoyed.

730
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:58,715
I see. Okay.

731
00:46:59,844 --> 00:47:02,154
You must not be happy to see me.

732
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:04,284
Then I'll just go.

733
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:05,424
Go where?

734
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:09,554
Should I stay?

735
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,125
What's wrong?

736
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,364
Why are you annoyed?

737
00:47:17,994 --> 00:47:19,665
You really won't tell me?

738
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,634
Why? We never had a proper
date since we started dating.

739
00:47:23,634 --> 00:47:24,974
I prepared all of this for you,

740
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:26,105
but you're always too busy.

741
00:47:26,105 --> 00:47:28,105
Tae Hoon says I'm too clingy.

742
00:47:28,105 --> 00:47:29,645
Seo Jun wants to ask you out.

743
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:31,844
I'm a total mess inside.

744
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,454
- What?
- I love you.

745
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:41,795
I love you, Ju Kyung.

746
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:45,665
Hey... If you say that so suddenly...

747
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:46,924
Then?

748
00:47:48,835 --> 00:47:50,195
It makes my heart flutter.

749
00:47:50,395 --> 00:47:52,735
How was your first day of class? Was it fun?

750
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:56,204
Yes. It's an intro class,
but everyone was like a pro.

751
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,744
I'm the only one who didn't
take the written exam yet.

752
00:47:58,744 --> 00:48:01,105
So I have to work hard
and pass on my first try.

753
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:03,715
Should we go somewhere
after your written exam?

754
00:48:03,844 --> 00:48:05,715
- Where?
- Somewhere you want to go.

755
00:48:08,855 --> 00:48:10,284
Should we go to the beach?

756
00:48:10,284 --> 00:48:12,724
We can take an early morning
bus to see the winter sea.

757
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:14,884
Okay. Let's do that.

758
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:19,224
Can I really not eat this?

759
00:48:19,224 --> 00:48:20,395
I got it for you...

760
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,264
You really were annoyed.

761
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:25,605
No. I meant we can eat it
together. Both you and I.

762
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:27,505
You take a bite, and I take a bite.

763
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:29,505
You skipped your tutoring session again.

764
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:32,704
Were you not scolded enough last time?

765
00:48:33,174 --> 00:48:34,344
Are you rebelling?

766
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:37,645
What is your problem? Answer me!

767
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:41,244
Give me your phone.

768
00:48:42,454 --> 00:48:45,454
- Why?
- What losers do you hang out with,

769
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:47,355
that you're so undisciplined?

770
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:51,355
Or is it because you're seeing
some punk? I need to check.

771
00:48:51,454 --> 00:48:53,695
- Hand over your phone!
- No.

772
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,335
Hand it over now!

773
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:01,065
You crazy little...

774
00:49:01,435 --> 00:49:02,474
Honey.

775
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:10,474
Let's go.

776
00:49:12,815 --> 00:49:13,884
Do you have it?

777
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:15,985
Okay.

778
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:17,114
I'm hungry.

779
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:21,284
Here. Dad, your rice

780
00:49:21,284 --> 00:49:22,355
Thanks.

781
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,824
- Soup bowls.
- Please help.

782
00:49:24,824 --> 00:49:26,895
- Okay.
- Here's yours.

783
00:49:29,695 --> 00:49:31,094
Grapefruit, let's eat.

784
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:35,335
Here.

785
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:36,335
Thank you.

786
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:38,474
Eat up, son.

787
00:49:38,704 --> 00:49:40,704
Son... Son?

788
00:49:40,775 --> 00:49:43,945
Son? He's Grapefruit. Grapefruit.

789
00:49:43,945 --> 00:49:46,614
Father. I'm not a grapefruit.

790
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:47,744
"Father"?

791
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:49,755
Your cheeks are all red like a grapefruit.

792
00:49:51,724 --> 00:49:54,224
We don't have to call you
"Mr. Han" at home do we?

793
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,594
- Right, future brother-in-law?
- That's excessive.

794
00:49:56,954 --> 00:50:00,264
Why did you break up because
of me? I feel bad now.

795
00:50:00,594 --> 00:50:03,665
The school year's over now and I'm
moving up a grade, so it's okay.

796
00:50:03,665 --> 00:50:06,605
Ju Kyung. I am so embarrassed.

797
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:08,605
Don't be. You'll be family soon.

798
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,804
Son.

799
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:14,945
Hee Kyung, what happened to me?

800
00:50:15,005 --> 00:50:17,114
What else? You're trapped now.

801
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:18,514
Eye booger.

802
00:50:21,514 --> 00:50:24,014
Eat up. Eat. Let's eat, Grapefruit.

803
00:50:24,014 --> 00:50:25,685
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

804
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,565
Seriously. I can't believe it.

805
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:51,607
- Here she is.
- Hey.

806
00:50:56,848 --> 00:51:00,087
Ju Kyung, have you seen the online community?

807
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,487
The online community?

808
00:51:04,587 --> 00:51:05,728
Look at her.

809
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,368
I misjudged her.

810
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:10,998
She's so selfish.

811
00:51:10,998 --> 00:51:13,038
Overheard in the girls' bathroom.

812
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:15,208
Kang Soo Jin from class
2-5 is a frightening witch.

813
00:51:15,268 --> 00:51:18,438
She's the one who uploaded the
video and pictures of Lim Ju Kyung.

814
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:21,578
They were best friends,
but she got jealous...

815
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,377
that Soo Ho was seeing her, and betrayed her.

816
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,777
I didn't make it up.

817
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:27,647
I witnessed another friend
lashing out at Kang Soo Jin.

818
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,587
She's like the villain in a drama.

819
00:51:29,688 --> 00:51:32,918
What is she, a psychopath?
Talk about a top-level traitor.

820
00:51:33,618 --> 00:51:35,728
- Oh my gosh.
- How could she do that?

821
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:37,458
To a friend of all people.

822
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,228
She betrayed a friend because of a guy?

823
00:51:39,228 --> 00:51:41,527
She's terrible. I totally misjudged her.

824
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:43,897
Don't you feel sorry for Ju Kyung?

825
00:51:43,897 --> 00:51:44,998
I know.

826
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:46,498
That witch.

827
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,638
Was she the one who took that
photo of Ju Kyung and Soo Ho?

828
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,138
Are you a stalker?

829
00:51:52,138 --> 00:51:53,578
You're mad scary.

830
00:51:53,638 --> 00:51:56,248
How will Soo Jin show her
face at school ever again?

831
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:58,147
It'll be hard.

832
00:51:58,147 --> 00:51:59,518
- She's like a criminal.
- That's right.

833
00:51:59,518 --> 00:52:00,947
That psycho.

834
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:04,688
I bet you think you destroyed Ju Kyung.

835
00:52:05,618 --> 00:52:07,018
But you just destroyed yourself.

836
00:52:07,717 --> 00:52:10,087
She's a total stalker.

837
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,587
She's leaving.

838
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,168
Where is she going?

839
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,138
Soo Jin!

840
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:26,078
Where are you going?

841
00:52:27,737 --> 00:52:29,248
Why are you running away?

842
00:52:34,177 --> 00:52:37,848
Do you still have nothing to say to me?

843
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:41,927
Don't you feel bad at all?

844
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:45,558
No. I don't feel bad.

845
00:52:48,728 --> 00:52:49,927
Still,

846
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,237
I don't want to lose you like this.

847
00:52:55,368 --> 00:52:57,967
So I want to reach out one last time.

848
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,308
Because I don't want to regret it later.

849
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:05,748
Soo Jin, let's not do this.

850
00:53:14,618 --> 00:53:16,357
Do you think I'll take your hand?

851
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:22,027
Do you really believe we can
go back to the way we were?

852
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,277
Ju Kyung, right?

853
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:37,908
It's good to meet you.

854
00:53:42,788 --> 00:53:43,817
Let's go.

855
00:55:01,058 --> 00:55:02,768
Eyeshadow, mascara...

856
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:11,168
And both cheeks...

857
00:55:22,788 --> 00:55:26,587
COSMETOLOGY CERTIFICATE EXAM

858
00:55:31,357 --> 00:55:32,427
Didn't you do well?

859
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:36,268
It's all right. You'll do better next time.

860
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:38,527
I passed!

861
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:41,938
Good job.

862
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:45,308
- I passed.
- I'm proud of you.

863
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:47,507
I even guessed one correctly.

864
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:49,447
- You got lucky.
- Right.

865
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:51,507
You're squeezing the air out of me.

866
00:55:56,647 --> 00:55:59,357
Tiger energy boost. Roar!

867
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:01,257
Wait, is it recyclable?

868
00:56:05,257 --> 00:56:06,397
Who cares? I'm done with it.

869
00:56:16,638 --> 00:56:21,478
CONTACTS, LIM JU KYUNG

870
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:28,377
You must be at ease now
that the exam is over.

871
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:30,047
This is only just the beginning.

872
00:56:30,288 --> 00:56:32,458
I hear the written test isn't even that hard,

873
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:34,857
so I'll have to give it my
all on the performance test.

874
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:36,427
So much for dates then.

875
00:56:37,328 --> 00:56:39,197
You should study for your exams too.

876
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:42,627
You don't seem to have been
doing much of that lately.

877
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:46,438
I've been too occupied by
a certain Lim Ju Kyung.

878
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,567
Just a second.

879
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:53,607
It's Seo Jun.

880
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,217
Hello?

881
00:57:03,188 --> 00:57:05,087
Are you done with your exam?

882
00:57:05,087 --> 00:57:06,688
How else would I be picking up?

883
00:57:07,288 --> 00:57:08,757
Why do you ask?

884
00:57:10,257 --> 00:57:12,127
I was hoping to see you.

885
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:14,328
Right now?

886
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:18,268
But I'm with Soo Ho. Can he come too?

887
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:21,138
No, just you and me.

888
00:57:21,697 --> 00:57:22,808
I have something to say.

889
00:57:23,868 --> 00:57:25,978
Well, this isn't a good time...

890
00:57:25,978 --> 00:57:28,177
Remember the wish you said you'd grant me?

891
00:57:29,248 --> 00:57:31,848
I'll text you the address. Meet me there.

892
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:36,447
Hey, Seo Jun.

893
00:57:37,947 --> 00:57:39,888
- What's with him?
- What did he say?

894
00:57:40,987 --> 00:57:43,288
He wants to tell me something in person.

895
00:57:43,857 --> 00:57:45,257
I'll tell him maybe next time.

896
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:48,627
Go ahead.

897
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,067
- What?
- Talk to him.

898
00:57:58,538 --> 00:57:59,607
Seo Jun!

899
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,177
Why were you waiting out in the cold?

900
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:05,478
Gosh, you now have a red nose.

901
00:58:10,388 --> 00:58:12,118
Anyway, what was so urgent?

902
00:58:22,527 --> 00:58:23,797
Let's go eat something.

903
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:38,748
This is on you, right?

904
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:41,777
You should've wished for
something more expensive.

905
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:43,547
This is what you like though.

906
00:58:43,547 --> 00:58:46,118
You're right. I could have this all week.

907
00:58:49,888 --> 00:58:51,558
What is it that you want to say to me?

908
00:58:52,598 --> 00:58:54,857
Did you ask me out just to make me buy this?

909
00:58:57,027 --> 00:58:58,627
- I need relationship advice.
- What?

910
00:58:59,197 --> 00:59:00,297
Really?

911
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:05,638
I'm not exactly an expert on the subject.

912
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:09,507
Lay it on me. I'll try and be helpful.

913
00:59:11,908 --> 00:59:14,217
- There's this girl I like.
- Right.

914
00:59:16,788 --> 00:59:17,987
But I'm going to move on.

915
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:20,158
Why? Have you told her how you feel?

916
00:59:20,987 --> 00:59:22,058
No.

917
00:59:22,288 --> 00:59:23,857
But you're already moving on?

918
00:59:24,987 --> 00:59:26,297
She has a boyfriend.

919
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,967
Why did it have to be a
girl who's already taken?

920
00:59:33,038 --> 00:59:34,168
Do you like her a lot?

921
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:37,138
Yes, a lot.

922
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:38,638
Oh, dear.

923
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:41,638
Then steal her away.

924
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:44,947
Should I?

925
00:59:45,607 --> 00:59:47,317
Who is it though? Does she go to our school?

926
00:59:48,478 --> 00:59:50,748
Forget it. It's a secret.

927
00:59:57,087 --> 00:59:58,257
You...

928
00:59:59,857 --> 01:00:00,958
No way.

929
01:00:09,408 --> 01:00:10,438
Is it Soo Ah?

930
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:14,237
Don't you dare steal her away. Poor Tae Hoon.

931
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:15,478
No.

932
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:18,447
- It's not her.
- It's not?

933
01:00:20,518 --> 01:00:23,188
She must be some girl for
you to have a crush on.

934
01:00:23,547 --> 01:00:25,018
She must be beautiful.

935
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:28,688
Yes, she is.

936
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:30,987
I have high standards, you know.

937
01:00:31,888 --> 01:00:34,527
Then you should've told her sooner
and made her your girlfriend.

938
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:39,797
Do you think she would've
come to me if I did?

939
01:00:40,797 --> 01:00:42,768
What good is all this now, right?

940
01:00:43,538 --> 01:00:46,277
I can't really help you,
so another portion...

941
01:00:47,007 --> 01:00:50,107
No, wait. I'll buy anything
here you wish to eat.

942
01:00:50,677 --> 01:00:53,047
- Can we get two more portions?
- Sure.

943
01:00:53,348 --> 01:00:55,118
Could she be any more clueless?

944
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:58,087
Want some fritters? What
else should we order?

945
01:01:27,677 --> 01:01:28,848
It smells nice.

946
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:48,168
Option 1, 2, or 3.

947
01:01:49,908 --> 01:01:51,067
Which one do you like the most?

948
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:29,277
Did I make you wait long?

949
01:02:30,578 --> 01:02:33,248
I bet I owe it to your hair. It's pretty.

950
01:02:34,177 --> 01:02:37,288
I called to say I was running
late, but you didn't pick up.

951
01:02:37,317 --> 01:02:39,418
- I left my phone at home.
- What?

952
01:02:43,058 --> 01:02:44,427
- Here.
- What's this?

953
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,927
This... Did you knit this yourself?

954
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,868
Someone asked me to do it
by handing me some yarn.

955
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:54,498
I never asked for anything.

956
01:02:54,797 --> 01:02:57,538
It was just to help you ease your mind.

957
01:02:57,938 --> 01:03:01,038
It's pretty though. It's
prettier than what you can buy.

958
01:03:01,808 --> 01:03:02,848
Let me.

959
01:03:07,177 --> 01:03:08,447
There.

960
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:11,688
- How do I look?
- Pretty.

961
01:03:14,587 --> 01:03:16,228
Our bus is here. Let's go.

962
01:03:29,837 --> 01:03:30,868
There.

963
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:43,288
Feeding the sheep has made me hungry too.

964
01:03:43,918 --> 01:03:45,748
I heard your stomach rumble earlier.

965
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:47,357
The sheep made that noise.

966
01:03:48,018 --> 01:03:50,857
I'm going to upload the
photos on social media.

967
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:54,697
NEW POST

968
01:03:56,768 --> 01:03:58,427
Why aren't you uploading
a photo of us together?

969
01:03:58,697 --> 01:04:01,467
What? I figured you might not like it.

970
01:04:02,098 --> 01:04:03,237
I'm fine with it.

971
01:04:04,938 --> 01:04:06,177
Then can I upload it?

972
01:04:09,038 --> 01:04:11,078
Lovestagram. Couples trip.

973
01:04:11,177 --> 01:04:13,918
Boyfriend. Healing. Couple photo.

974
01:04:14,118 --> 01:04:15,248
There we go.

975
01:04:16,947 --> 01:04:18,047
We look nice.

976
01:04:21,018 --> 01:04:22,087
What do you want to eat?

977
01:04:22,828 --> 01:04:23,927
What should we eat?

978
01:04:37,038 --> 01:04:38,138
Why are you smiling?

979
01:04:38,268 --> 01:04:40,478
- Are you making me look weird?
- No.

980
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:41,777
Let me see.

981
01:04:42,408 --> 01:04:43,647
Let's show each other at the same time.

982
01:04:44,277 --> 01:04:46,078
1, 2, 3.

983
01:04:50,518 --> 01:04:51,618
What...

984
01:04:53,788 --> 01:04:56,288
I thought you were good at everything.

985
01:04:57,158 --> 01:04:58,257
It's cute.

986
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:00,127
It looks nice.

987
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:01,257
Let me see mine.

988
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,168
Looks nice, right?

989
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:05,728
The nostrils are a bit...

990
01:05:05,967 --> 01:05:07,897
I'm not done yet.

991
01:05:09,337 --> 01:05:11,038
Just a second. I'll reduce them a bit.

992
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,618
Be careful.

993
01:05:25,918 --> 01:05:26,987
Watch out.

994
01:05:51,377 --> 01:05:52,507
Here we go again.

995
01:05:54,478 --> 01:05:55,547
Is it fun?

996
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:33,588
Hello. Long time no see.

997
01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:35,588
Yes, long time no see.

998
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,658
Hey, why are you talking
to me with no honorifics?

999
01:06:37,658 --> 01:06:38,727
Because that's how you're talking to me.

1000
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:40,097
You're Ju Kyung's friend.

1001
01:06:40,258 --> 01:06:41,758
I'm her older sister.

1002
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,397
You're Ju Kyung's older sister?

1003
01:06:45,097 --> 01:06:46,197
Yes.

1004
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:49,267
Why am I seeing two beautiful men?

1005
01:06:49,267 --> 01:06:51,008
Am I in paradise?

1006
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,008
Hee Kyung!

1007
01:06:59,147 --> 01:07:01,017
So you're that lady who
got drunk and threw a fit?

1008
01:07:01,678 --> 01:07:02,788
Throw a fit?

1009
01:07:03,618 --> 01:07:05,618
- You saw me do that?
- What brings you here?

1010
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:07,687
You're a star, Seo Jun.

1011
01:07:08,187 --> 01:07:09,288
What are you talking about?

1012
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,557
Don't you know that you're
all over the internet...

1013
01:07:12,557 --> 01:07:14,998
including Newstagram? Here. Take a look.

1014
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:18,897
You stole my heart

1015
01:07:18,897 --> 01:07:20,968
- What about it?
- What do you mean?

1016
01:07:21,868 --> 01:07:23,567
You're still not interested
in becoming a singer?

1017
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:25,708
Are you going to keep working here part-time?

1018
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,578
If you want to become a cafe owner,
then I'll support your dream.

1019
01:07:27,578 --> 01:07:29,647
But i heard you wanted to become a singer.

1020
01:07:30,048 --> 01:07:33,847
Do you really think I'll sign a
contract with that agency again?

1021
01:07:34,178 --> 01:07:35,317
Why not?

1022
01:07:35,777 --> 01:07:38,248
As you already know, all
the executives got replaced.

1023
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:41,618
Move Entertainment has changed.
We're not like how we used to be.

1024
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:45,027
Why are you so desperate to convince me?

1025
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:50,227
Because I got a hunch.

1026
01:07:50,428 --> 01:07:53,538
I saw a video of you as a trainee
back when I was looking for Leo.

1027
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,008
Why don't you start singing again?

1028
01:07:57,508 --> 01:07:59,237
I want you to sing again.

1029
01:07:59,807 --> 01:08:02,607
I'm sure Se Yeon would want the same thing.

1030
01:08:05,508 --> 01:08:06,548
What do you say?

1031
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:11,947
- Hello?
- Seo Jun, are you with Soo Ho?

1032
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:05,368
- Let's take another photo.
- A photo?

1033
01:09:05,368 --> 01:09:06,637
- Yes.
- I'll bring your cell phone.

1034
01:09:06,637 --> 01:09:07,708
Just a second.

1035
01:09:21,317 --> 01:09:24,828
SOO HO...

1036
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:32,727
SOO HO, I LOVE YOU.

1037
01:09:34,968 --> 01:09:36,038
Ju Kyung.

1038
01:09:38,567 --> 01:09:39,708
What did you write?

1039
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:41,277
SOO HO, I LOVE YOU.

1040
01:09:44,107 --> 01:09:46,477
- Too bad you didn't get to see it.
- What did you write?

1041
01:09:46,477 --> 01:09:47,947
It's a secret.

1042
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:52,147
- Stand there.
- Okay.

1043
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:57,288
Your phone is dead.

1044
01:09:57,658 --> 01:09:59,998
I guess we took too many photos earlier.

1045
01:10:00,798 --> 01:10:03,027
We won't get to take any photos by the sea.

1046
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:04,727
Why don't we come back and take
photos here a little later?

1047
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,397
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1048
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,137
- Let's look for a charger.
- Okay.

1049
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:14,908
Soo Ho!

1050
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,347
Soo Ho!

1051
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:19,817
The phone is turned off. You
will be directed to voicemail.

1052
01:10:19,817 --> 01:10:21,418
Why aren't they both picking up?

1053
01:10:23,817 --> 01:10:26,088
Seo Jun, what's up?

1054
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,258
Are you with Soo Ah?

1055
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:29,958
Ask her if Ju Kyung is with Soo Ho right now.

1056
01:10:31,788 --> 01:10:32,857
What? The sea?

1057
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:37,968
- It looks delicious.
- Let's eat.

1058
01:10:43,538 --> 01:10:44,668
Try this too.

1059
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:46,637
It's delicious.

1060
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:48,807
I think I have two stomachs.

1061
01:10:48,807 --> 01:10:51,048
I ate a tone of tteokbokki
yesterday with Seo Jun,

1062
01:10:51,048 --> 01:10:52,208
but I can still eat more.

1063
01:10:52,477 --> 01:10:54,618
- Did the conversation go well?
- Yes.

1064
01:10:55,647 --> 01:10:57,218
He wanted to ask for my
advice on someone he likes.

1065
01:10:59,987 --> 01:11:03,187
Do you think he likes Soo Ah?

1066
01:11:05,487 --> 01:11:06,557
What?

1067
01:11:06,697 --> 01:11:08,397
That's going to make things so complicated.

1068
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:11,128
But he said he doesn't like
her, so I should believe him.

1069
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:14,038
This one is ready to eat.

1070
01:11:21,937 --> 01:11:23,048
Why are you laughing?

1071
01:11:23,477 --> 01:11:25,508
- It's a pity I can't take a photo.
- Why?

1072
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,777
- Is there something on my face?
- Come here.

1073
01:11:35,288 --> 01:11:37,187
- You're good now.
- You smudged it, didn't you?

1074
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:39,187
- Yes.
- Seriously?

1075
01:11:39,187 --> 01:11:40,227
What?

1076
01:11:40,227 --> 01:11:41,557
Try the noodles. It's really good.

1077
01:11:46,328 --> 01:11:47,538
Why won't they both pick up?

01:11:57,008 --> 01:11:59,508
- Aren't you cold?
- No, I'm good.

1081
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:01,878
Let's come back once it gets warm.

1082
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:04,288
Okay. Let's do that.

1083
01:12:06,817 --> 01:12:08,017
Hey.

1084
01:12:09,288 --> 01:12:13,027
The stuff I wrote earlier on the sand...

1085
01:12:14,857 --> 01:12:15,928
It was actually...

1086
01:12:41,118 --> 01:12:42,387
Why are your eyes closed?

1087
01:12:49,968 --> 01:12:53,737
Gosh, it stings. There was sand in my eyes.

1088
01:12:53,998 --> 01:12:56,168
- What were you thinking about?
- What?

1089
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:58,567
I was thinking about the sand in my eyes.

1090
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:01,078
My goodness.

1091
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,668
- Watch your hands.
- Okay.

1092
01:13:34,607 --> 01:13:35,977
It's pretty.

1093
01:13:38,477 --> 01:13:40,418
Let's take a photo.

1094
01:13:40,548 --> 01:13:41,647
Sure.

1095
01:13:41,748 --> 01:13:43,048
I'll bring your cell phone from the charger.

1096
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:45,248
Just a second.

1097
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:56,767
Is it fully charged?

1098
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,838

1099

What are you doing here?

1101
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:12,307
Why aren't you checking your phone?

1102
01:14:12,678 --> 01:14:13,678
What is it?

1103
01:14:13,878 --> 01:14:14,977
Soo Ho.

Soo Ho, it's time to go.

1108
01:15:43,368 --> 01:15:45,838
Go home. I'll go.

1109

I'll call you when I land.

1117
01:16:44,328 --> 01:16:45,368
Bye.

1118
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,408
Oh no.

1119
01:17:28,637 --> 01:17:30,548
What if he passes away?

1120
01:17:32,508 --> 01:17:34,178
Poor Soo Ho...
