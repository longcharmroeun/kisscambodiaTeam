The phone is turned off...

6
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,260
Do you have anything to say to your victims?

7
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,999
Are the claims true?

8
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:58,499
Please say a few words to your disappointed fans.

9
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,329
What do you have to say for yourself?

10
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,335
- Do you have any words? - Over here!

11

Where are you going?

12
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:07,834
To Soo Ho.

13
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,334
What?

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,844
He'll believe in me. His trust will be enough...

15
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,814
to get through to his dad.

16
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,480

I'm sorry.

25
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,154
Soo Ho.

26
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:34,554
You must be happy even after killing your friend.

27
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,089
Is it because of the helmet?

28
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:06,554
No.

29
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,355
- I came to eat with you. - Seriously?

30
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:17,095
Seo Jun!

31
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,445
Are you serious?

32
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,545
Hit me.

33
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,915
Go ahead and hit me.

34
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,614
Hey!

35
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,714
What do you think you're doing?

36
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,855
Back away from each other!

37
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,375
Seo Jun, what's the matter with you?

38
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,904
You wanted to be an idol star, but did you quit...

39
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,075
and decide to be a gangster instead?

40
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,650
How dare you start a fistfight at school?

41
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,485
Right, sir? I was totally shocked myself.

42
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:46,129
I saw them fighting each other,

43
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,230
and I almost threw up what I was eating.

44
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,195
- Get lost! - Yes, sir.

45
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,894
Goodbye.

46
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,925
What if this causes to gather a school violence committee?

47
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,394
Do you want to get expelled?

48
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,265
I started the fight, sir.

49
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,109
My goodness, Soo Ho.

50
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:03,235
Why are you defending him?

51
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:06,650
My gosh, you took a leave of absence because of your mother's illness,

52
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,875
and this is what you do?

53
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:11,920
Your mother must be extremely upset because of how you behave.

54
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,619
I can already guess why your mother got sick.

55
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,815
Sir, I think that's enough.

56
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:23,730
My goodness. Soo Ho already agreed to forgive him.

57
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,059
So let's wrap it up.

58
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,730
There's no need to gather a school violence committee.

59
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,865
Don't you think so?

60
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,704
You punk!

61
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,109
Soo Ho, you have a math competition in two days.

62
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:38,879
So you should take good care of your condition.

63
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,844
You can go back to your classroom.

64
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,255
You punk!

65
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,030
What's with that look? How dare you glare like that!

66
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,164
- You little... - Sir, that's enough.

67
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,195
Hurry up and apologize!

68
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,635
Are you okay?

69
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,404
Oh, you got hurt.

70
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,575
You should've broken an arm or something.

71
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,175
Then I would've won the math competition.

72
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,315
Get lost if you're going to talk nonsense.

73
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,615
Or you should've just beat him to a pulp.

74
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,485
You should've taught him a lesson so he'd never bother you again.

75
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,755
Why did you even bother to learn Jiu-Jitsu?

76
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,059
You may be tall,

77
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,125
but you're weak on the inside just like in elementary school.

78
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,265
What happened between you and Seo Jun?

79
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,964
Is this about Jeong Se Yeon?

80
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,575
Hey. Apply this.

81
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,520
I heard the two guys fought because of her.

82
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,615
Are they in a love triangle? Unbelievable.

83
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,815
What's going on?

84
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:02,055
I heard you got asked out by both Soo Ho and Seo Jun.

85
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,830
Which one are you going to choose?

86
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,224
Come on. Tell us.

87
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,340
What are you talking about?

88
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,135
Let's hear the drum roll.

89
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,704
Is it going to be Soo Ho or Seo Jun?

90
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:20,879
Which person are you going to choose?

91
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,044
- Who will it be? - Tell us.

92
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,714
Just go vote for Eighteen on "M Countdown".

93
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,485
It's not what you think. Why would they like me?

94
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:31,985
Maybe they just fought because they hate each other.

95
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,755
- No way. - No.

96
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:40,224
But here's the question. Why did Mr. Han...

97
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,334
sit next to Ms. Lim?

98
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,805
- That's what I want to know. - Cut it out.

99
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,235
Gosh, that's enough. Let's just believe what she says.

100
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:54,109
Go back to your classes.

101
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:55,505
- My gosh. - Why?

102
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,445
Just get out of here.

103
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,084
- Get out. - My gosh.

104
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,454
You're going through this because you're pretty.

105
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,284
If an average-looking girl was sitting there,

106
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,084
no one would've started such a rumor.

107
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,495
It must be exhausting.

108
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,094
I can't believe this is happening.

109
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:17,439
When it comes to stuff like this,

110
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,910
it might've been better when no one even cared about me.

111
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,565
- It's Soo Ho. - Soo Ho is here.

112
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,735
- What's going on? - What happened?

113
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:32,485
Soo Ho.

114
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,615
Can we talk for a moment?

115
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,024
Soo Ho.

116
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,729
Who do you think you are to mess with Seo Jun?

117
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,429
You audacive punk.

118
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,495
- "Audacious". - It's audacious.

119
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,034
Is that the right word?

120
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:50,265
Whatever.

121
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,569
What will you do if Seo Jun gets disciplined because of you?

122
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:56,280
You held him by his collar first, so it was self-offense.

123
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,235
- "Self-defense". - Yes, it's self-defense.

124
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,380
Is that what it is?

125
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,705
Are you pretending to be gangsters?

126
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,715
Where do you think you're going?

127
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,444
You're crossing the line.

128
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,284
- He's crossing the line. - Don't stop him.

129
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,194
- What should we do? - Do you work out?

130
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:22,735
- My gosh, will you step in already? - Okay, you got it.

131
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:23,995
Gosh...

132
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,335
My gosh, you little...

133
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:29,574
That's enough.

134
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:36,975
It's like you guys are here to catch a pig.

135
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,245
You darn punks!

136
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:43,684
Are you fighting again?

137
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,729
- Hello, sir. - It's not what you think.

138
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,885
- Be quiet! - Why did he have to overreact?

139
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:53,965
You guys are always in a group looking for trouble.

140
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,370
- We were just working out. - Cut the nonsense!

141
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,694
I can tell you never work out!

142
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,705
Hey. My gosh.

143
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,674
Let's see what you've got.

144
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,544
Soo Ho, I let you off the hook because I didn't want to kill you.

145
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:13,784
- Seriously. - I don't think he can hear you.

146
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,684
I'll go tell him.

147
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,255
- Soo Ho! - Man Sik... Man Sik.

148
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,130
I... I have a muscle cramp.

149
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,694
- A muscle cramp? - I have a muscle cramp.

150
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,824
- Let's go! - Call 911.

151
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,694
- Are you okay? - The back of my neck hurts.

152
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,934
Hello?

153
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:33,635
Seo Jun.

154
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:38,835
What do you want from me?

155
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,345
What do I want?

156
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,074
Stay out of my sight.

157
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,085
If you don't want to see me, don't come near me.

158
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,644
I have no reason to avoid you.

159
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,855
You brazen punk.

160
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,955
But then again, that's who you really are.

161
00:10:58,229 --> 00:10:59,394
That day,

162
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,564
when Se Yeon came to see me...

163
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,664
What?

164
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,044
Isn't it too late to give me an excuse?

165
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,385
Do you know...

166
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,314
what that poor guy said to me that day?

167
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,015
He said...

168
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:27,585
you'd believe in him.

169
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,495
Without even knowing that you're a cold-hearted and selfish jerk,

170
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,335
he counted on you and ran over to see you.

171
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,304
So don't ever...

172
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,335
say his name again.

173
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,684
Bring Se Yeon back.

174
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:29,914
Bring him back!

175
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,054
Bring him back!

176
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,324
Bring Se Yeon back, you jerk!

179
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,280

("The Cursed Mask")

181
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:41,024
Is it because the story is scary?

182
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,095
It's okay. Don't cry.

183
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,299
It isn't scary at all.

184
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:51,164
Look, I'm a squirrel. A squirrel.

185
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,939
Isn't that funny?

186
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,240
Meow. I'm a cat.

187
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,034
Meow. I'm a cat.

188
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,020
You're smiling. I'm a squirrel.

189
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,345
I'm a squirrel.

190
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:08,620
Did you know? If you cry then laugh,

191
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,314
you'll get a hairy butt!

192
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,630
I'm a squirrel. A squirrel.

193
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,554
A squirrel.

194
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,694
Soo Ho.

195
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,265
I was walking by and saw you inside.

196
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,434
Here. Drink it.

197
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,975
I saw Seo Jun leave earlier. Did you clean all by yourself?

198
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:37,078
Why did you let him leave?

199
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,644
Why were you fighting like little kids?

200
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,154
Never mind. I shouldn't talk.

201
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,054
I just fought with my brother not long ago.

202
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,255
I fight at least once a day myself.

203
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:55,524
When my brother and I fight,

204
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,495
our mom makes us do something to make up.

205
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,934
"I love you."

206
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,674
We have to say that...

207
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,005
and clip each other's toenails...

208
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,774
- like this. - Toenails?

209
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:15,490
If you clip each other's toenails, it gets all tickly.

210
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,184
So you naturally make up.

211
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,654
Did you just laugh?

212
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,400
I've never seen you laugh.

213
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,434
No, I didn't.

214
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,505
I don't know what happened,

215
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:39,209
but if you need someone to talk to later on, just let me know.

216
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,105
You can vent to me.

217
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:46,914
There's nothing I can't do for the Divine Soo Ho.

218
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,914
What? The Divine Soo Ho?

219
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,715
The kids said your nickname was the Divine Soo Ho.

220
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,824
Didn't you know, Divine Soo Ho?

221
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,424
I'm not divine.

222
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,755
Don't call me that.

223
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,924
Why not? You are the Divine Soo Ho to me too.

224
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,635
The merciful divinity that keeps my no-makeup face secret.

225
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,015
Are you that worried?

226
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,444
About what?

227
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,355
Your no-makeup face.

228
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,725
Don't all girls look different with makeup on?

229
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,424
Don't say that to other people.

230
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,664
I'm extreme. It's like night and day.

231
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,894
I can't really tell.

232
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,804
Are you blind? How could you not tell?

233
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,579
I studied and practiced so much to create that look.

234
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:48,904
I'm transforming this face.

235
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,644
Did you hurt your lip?

236
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,914
That must hurt.

237
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:11,034
Don't read adult comics.

238
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:19,749
You should go home. Look at the time. Go. Get going.

239
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,509
- It's not even 8pm. - So go home and study.

240
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,820
A student shouldn't be at a comic book shop.

241
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,814
You get bad grades, don't you? What place are you in?

242
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,915
I do not!

243
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:30,189
Who's after Sejong the Great? Three seconds.

244
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:32,090
- 1, 2, 3. - Gojong...

245
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,090
What happened to the 400 years? You really must have bad grades.

246
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,495
Go home. Go.

247
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:38,495
- Wait... - Go home and study.

248
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,634
She says whatever she feels like.

249
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,114
Oh my gosh.

250
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,245
That's so dangerous.

251
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,185
Ju Kyung.

252
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:11,324
Me? What?

253
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,655
Are you going out with Soo Ho?

254
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:14,425
I am not.

255
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,034
- Are you really not? - Definitely not.

256
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:20,005
I am not.

257
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,834
Looking at you, I don't think you are either.

258
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,505
What? What did he see?

259
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,314
- Oh my gosh. - Look.

260
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,544
- Is her nose bleeding? - It's so red.

261
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,015
Darn it.

262
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,859
Hey, hey, hey, Lee Soo Ho

263
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,465
Hey ho, hey ho, yahoo

264
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,165
Hey.

265
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,435
He'll never play along no matter how much My Hoonie tries.

266
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,584
This classroom looks like my pimples.

267
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,685
I don't know when they'll pop.

268
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,884
I said to buy me food. What's taking him so long?

269
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,844
Is he shy?

270
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,525
I'll give him one more day.

271
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,829
The function of x is seven.

272
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:42,394
So what's the value when x is six?

273
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,594
Naturally, it's seven.

274
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:47,640
Because the value of the function is always seven.

275
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,735
Okay, who wants to solve the next problem?

276
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,644
I'm the fool for asking.

277
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,078
How about our math geniuses, the Soo-Soo couple?

278
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,374
Come out. Problems 1 and 2.

279
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,545
And...

280
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,055
our new girl. Lim Ju Kyung. Try problem three.

281
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,725
No. No way.

282
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,295
Hey. Soo Ho.

283
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,334
Help me.

284
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,505
At least the rule.

285
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,505
Divine Soo Ho.

286
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,184
I knew it.

287
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,654
You'll win the math competition this year too.

288
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:19,025
The principal has high hopes for you.

289
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,624
You have to do well.

290
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:23,594
You need to feel the pressure, okay?

291
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,864
It changes the mood of the school board.

292
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,295
Okay?

293
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,475
This is the limiting value of my despair.

294
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:40,945
Ju Kyung?

295
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:44,084
The problems are different. What's the point in looking?

296
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,285
Right?

297
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,955
Seo Jun must know the answer.

298
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,965
Seo Jun, come out and solve it for her.

299
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,195
That won't work on me. Come on out.

300
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,104
Yes.

301
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,305
Why you...

302
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,245
Hurry up.

303
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:18,545
I guess I can't go to college by flunking math.

304
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,884
Just get good scores on other subjects.

305
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,059
I'll never make it into college.

306
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,555
Why don't you join our math academy?

307
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,124
Both Doo Jin and Soo Ho take classes there.

308
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:28,630
- Should I? - Yes.

309
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,670
My mom did tell me to find a math class to take.

310
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,465
Then join us. You can join our study session too.

311
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,470
I couldn't be more grateful.

312
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,809
Soo Ho, want to join a study?

313
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,334
We have room for one more.

314
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,039
No.

315
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,979
My mom will only approve if you study with us.

316
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,205
Then tell her I am.

317
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,414
You want me to lie to her?

318
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:48,844
Just join us instead.

319
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:53,015
He's always playing hard to get.

320
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:54,660
It's what I expected.

321
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,485
It'll be just us three and my Hoonie.

322
00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:00,055
Got it. We'll begin the sessions once Ju Kyung joins our math class.

323
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,360
Skip classes to go on dates with Tae Hoon...

324
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,424
- and you're out. - Got it.

325
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:08,594
By the way, I gave your number to the guy I'm setting you up with.

326
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,235
- Already? - Yes.

327
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:12,934
He'll call you soon. Anyway, look.

328
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,235
Isn't he handsome?

329
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,748
It's about having a good personality.

330
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:18,104
Meet him a few times before you date him.

331
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,515
But I'm not ready for this yet.

332
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,319
Maybe I should meet him to be free of all these rumors?

333
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,084
That's right. Nice thinking.

334
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,184
He's already head over heels for you.

335
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,864
What...

336
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,334
Why are you...

337
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,664
The comic book store.

338
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,205
You read a lot of them, you know.

339
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,674
How you're top of the class is a mystery.

340
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,174
Here. Good luck on your exam tomorrow.

341
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,574
I don't have a sweet tooth.

342
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,485
I see.

343
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:07,324
I heard that you're competing with mathletes from all over the country.

344
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,169
What are the questions like? The ones from our mock CSAT tests?

345
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,765
Do you get quizzed on unions and intersections of sets?

346
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,634
I bet that's all the math you know.

347
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,664
As if. That's what we learn in freshman year.

348
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,574
What's the formula for the equation of a circle?

349
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,249
Math is my weakest subject.

350
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,545
Which king ruled after King Sejong?

351
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,620
Ambushing me by changing the subject...

352
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,749
makes me forget what I know.

353
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:32,914
You don't know, do you?

354
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,460
(Ji Woo Hyeon)

355
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,255
The blind date guy texted me.

356
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,660
Hi, I'm Ji Woo Hyeon.

357
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,955
When should we meet?

358
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,624
Will you go on a blind date when you barely study?

359
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,394
Life experience can also teach you something.

360
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,670
(Hi, I'm Lim Ju Kyung.)

361
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,940
Besides, who knows?

362
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,410
I may get to receive private lessons...

363
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,009
from my boyfriend who attends Hanguk University.

364
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,680
Getting a boyfriend could lead to better grades.

365
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,809
How about tomorrow? When are you free?

366
00:24:58,809 --> 00:24:59,945
Tomorrow?

367
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:02,979
People go on blind dates in the evening, right?

368
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,920
No, during the day when it's bright outside.

369
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,515
Oh, I see.

370
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,955
I prefer midday.

371
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,354
- You seem thrilled. - As if.

372
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,025
This is because you and Seo Jun chose to argue in my face.

373
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,295
It led to weird rumors.

374
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,594
Why did you agree to the date when you don't want to?

375
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:27,074
It's not that I don't want to. I'm just nervous.

376
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,005
You see, it'll be my first time...

377
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,275
being alone with a guy outside of school.

378
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,174
What about me then?

379
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,299
Seriously? How could you grab my face...

380
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,164
like it's some pumpkin rolling down an alley?

381
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:52,265
I have eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

382
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,205
Hey. It's the movie I wanted to see.

383
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,055
I thought you were off to the comic book store.

384
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,084
What's with him?

385
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,495
Good luck on your exam tomorrow.

386
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,640
(VIP Ward)

387
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,805
- Mom! - Seo Jun?

388
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:39,279
Did you meet with the doctor?

389
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,215
Why did you come here instead of going home after school?

390
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,785
Don't tell me you rode your motorcycle here.

391
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,745
I told you I was done with it.

392
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,725
Ms. Mi Hyang, why are you being a worry-wart?

393
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:53,089
What did the doctor say?

394
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,729
The transplant is taking well...

395
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:57,124
and my numbers are all good.

396
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,824
I was told not to skip my medicine.

397
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:03,035
That's great! We should grab something nice to eat...

398
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,870
- and call Go Woon out. - Maybe next time.

399
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,535
I have someplace to be today.

400
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,205
Where?

401
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,049
Must you make a mess in here like this?

402
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:14,079
These are the candles I made at the culture center.

403
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,979
Hand them out to your regulars.

404
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:18,390
I'll try selling them officially if they respond well to them.

405
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,755
Can you please not do anything officially?

406
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,124
But I love the calming scents.

407
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,555
I only receive aroma oil massages, you know.

408
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,025
What's the scent, Mr. Lim?

409
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,930
The scent is from flowers of ylang ylang trees.

410
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,539
It's especially good at...

411
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:36,839
lowering blood pressure and balancing your hormones.

412
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,410
- Ylang ylang... - Scoot off, will you?

413
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,035
Sure, I'll hurry off.

414
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,410
Gosh, how handsome.

415
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,975
Just gazing at him will get you your fill.

416
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:47,650
- Why keep nagging him though? - If it weren't for his looks,

417
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,815
I would've dumped him years ago.

418
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:53,860
Unbelievable.

419
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,555
You're back as Ju Kyung again.

420
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,955
I honestly couldn't tell with all the makeup.

421
00:27:58,529 --> 00:27:59,884
That's some magical power you have.

422
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,495
It's called the Ju Kyung Magic.

423
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,200
I washed my face, so give me a facial.

424
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,739
I already told you I can't. Besides, I'm super busy.

425
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:10,739
Go home and study.

426
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:11,940
But it won't take long.

427
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,164
Hyun Sook!

428
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:17,644
My gosh. Mi Hyang, is that you?

429
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,515
What on earth is he doing here?

430
00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:23,844
But I have no makeup on.

431
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,485
This is my son.

432
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:30,725
Hello, ma'am.

433
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,394
My gosh. Goodness gracious.

434
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:38,124
How on earth can one be so handsome?

435
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:42,394
There's my second daughter...

436
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:59,844
Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?

437
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,184
Get up, Ju Kyung!

438
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,285
Lim Ju Kyung?

439
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,329
You look way better now that you're not on dialysis.

440
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:15,995
Surgery went well thanks to my doctor.

441
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,210
I got lucky.

442
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,965
I'm happy for you.

443
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,579
Have you been well, Hyun Sook?

444
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:22,634
Of course., I have.

445
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,604
Unbelievable.

446
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:33,315
Mom, I'm going home.

447
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,620
Will you frighten the neighbors at this hour?

448
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,815
Wash your face first.

449
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,394
Then I have to put on my makeup at this late hour.

450
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,614
Being that pretty must make you popular at school.

451
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:44,785
You must be close to Seo Jun since you're classmates.

452
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:49,555
No, we're not.

453
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:53,268
They can be starting today then.

454
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,535
You both clearly have everything going for you.

455
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:00,834
Since we said hello, come by the house tomorrow.

456
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,775
I'll cook you a meal.

457
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:05,674
But I'm studying with friends tomorrow.

458
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:07,614
She's going on a blind date.

459
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:10,945
A blind date at your age?

460
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,489
Now I get why you desperately wanted a facial.

461
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,525
Come on. You only get to be young once.

462
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,955
I'd love my Seo Jun to have a girlfriend,

463
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,025
but all he loves to do is riding his motorcycle.

464
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:26,065
Although, he quit recently.

465
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:27,765
He rides it all the time.

466
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,134
- He sped... - Hey!

467
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:31,965
He sped past me...

468
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,910
and almost hit me too.

469
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,610
Are you kidding me? You promised.

470
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,104
How can I not ride what I own? Riding the bus is a waste of money.

471
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,674
So much for the tough-guy act.

472
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:44,190
He's as soft as my brother in front of his mother.

473
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,684
You leave me with no choice.

474
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,414
Ju Kyung, could you do me a favor...

475
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,584
and stop him from riding his motorcycle?

476
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:55,455
Let me know immediately if you ever spot him on it.

477
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:57,999
Mom, there's no need to...

478
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,765
So you'll break our promise?

479
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,295
Could you do that for me?

480
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,035
Of course. I won't let you down.

481
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:16,745
I guess I can't hang around here with no makeup on anymore.

482
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,785
I almost got caught.

483
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,285
Hey, you.

484
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,525
You'd better not say anything funny to my mom.

485
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,854
What... What do you mean? About your motorcycle?

486
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,894
- I already promised your mom... - And?

487
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,265
What do you mean "And"? What else is there?

488
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,174
- That you got beaten up by those... - What?

489
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:46,805
If that's not it...

490
00:32:46,979 --> 00:32:50,275
What else could you have done wrong?

491
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:55,055
That you almost got disciplined for fighting with Soo Ho?

492
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,455
I will never tell her any of that.

493
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,795
I'm really good at keeping secrets.

494
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,575
He's a real troublemaker.

495
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,575
This is hilarious.

496
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:34,299
When you go on blind dates,

497
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:37,865
you're not able to look at a mirror in front of your date that often.

498
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
"I have a blind date today."

499
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,834
"So let's try wearing a different color."

500
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,465
"I should try a different kind of makeup."

501
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,374
I'm sure some of you think that way.

502
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,905
Hey, you. No. Don't use that color.

503
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,275
Stop moving right now.

504
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,819
Even if it's a special day, you shouldn't wear...

505
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,249
This isn't the eye shadow that I normally wear.

506
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,660
Then your makeup will look really awkward,

507
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,624
and it'll turn out bad.

508
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,930
Just stick to the stuff that you normally use.

509
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,724
Instead, emphasize the details,

510
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,434
and do your best to look lovely.

511
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:35,454
"I've heard a lot about you, Woo Hyeon."

512
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,184
"Woo Hyeon"? Isn't that too friendly?

513
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:41,655
Or should I call him by his last name?

514
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,965
No, that's a bit weird. What should I call him?

What's there to study?

526
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,859
You're so annoying.

You act like you didn't study, but I bet you'll ace the test.

Aren't you sick of saying that every time we take a test?

531
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,439
I take my test here. Good luck.

Hello.

00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,804
It's nice to meet you. Take a seat.

538
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,345
Okay.

539
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,885
You look prettier than your photos. I almost didn't recognize you.

540
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,684
Gosh, that can't be.

541
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,084
I'm serious.

542
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,224
- Can I speak to you comfortably? - Sure. Go ahead.

543
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:29,454
What do you want to drink? The bubble tea is delicious here.

544
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:31,164
Yes. I like it.

545
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,235
You just made my heart flutter. Did you just say you like me?

546
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,465
I meant I like bubble tea.

547
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:41,675
It was a joke.

548
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,525
Welcome.

549
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,494
- 1 popcorn and 2 colas, please. - Okay.

550
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:06,525
I'll buy this. You paid for the movie tickets.

551
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,264
Today's our first date, so I'll pay for everything.

552
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,934
That way, I'll get to see you next time.

553
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:15,180
"Next time"? Does that mean he wants to meet again?

554
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,735
Here's your popcorn.

555
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,345
How quick.

556
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:01,914
Are there no customers?

557
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,914
That darn jerk.

558
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,124
- What's going on? - What is he doing?

559
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:41,295
Hey, I can't see anything.

560
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,854
Who are you?

561
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,394
Do you know him?

562
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:48,565
No, how would I know him?

563
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,394
I'm sorry.

564
00:39:53,709 --> 00:39:56,075
Gosh, I shouldn't be here right now.

565
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:57,474
Ha Ru!

566
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,704
Dan Ho! Dan Ho!

567
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:11,124
What are you doing?

568
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,655
Go away.

569
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,365
I'd walk you home if I could, but I have a school gathering.

570
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,434
I'm sorry.

571
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,540
It's okay. You should go.

572
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,735
Thank you.

573
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,509
Will we able to meet again?

574
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:32,775
What?

575
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,545
Sure.

576
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,215
Was I too straightforward?

577
00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:41,454
I'll contact you later.

578
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,715
Have a safe trip home.

579
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:47,755
Okay.

580
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,054
Bye.

581
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:05,505
Why am I being a loser?

582
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,815
What's the matter with me?

583
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,815
Hey, baby. Where are you?

584
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,045
I'm already here.

585
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,755
Ta-da.

586
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:18,184
- Hey, honey. - Baby, when did you get here?

587
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,425
Did I keep you waiting?

588
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:21,695
I missed you so much, so I came early.

589
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,825
Let's go.

590
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,239
How was it? How did he look? What did you guys eat?

591
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,970
What's his personality like? Are you going to meet him again?

592
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,639
You're asking me so many questions. He did ask if we could meet again.

593
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,034
It looks like you might hit it off.

594
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:40,009
(How was it? How did he look? What did you guys eat?)

595
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:42,845
Did you get home? I miss you already.

596
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,290
He just texted me. What do I say? How should I reply?

597
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,060
Hey, calm down. Don't reply right away.

598
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,359
Wait until you text him back.

599
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,269
I can't do that. He'll get upset if he thinks I'm ignoring him.

600
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,965
Don't even look at your cell phone. It's time to play hard to get.

601
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:02,865
"Playing hard to get"?

602
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:05,469
Doesn't it hurt? Are you sure it feels nice?

603
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,604
Yes.

604
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,775
- Does it feel good? - Yes, it does.

605
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:12,775
So you won't contact me, is that it?

606
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:15,220
Should I just go to the school?

607
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,945
I'm home.

608
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:18,985
That looks good.

609
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:22,520
Where did you go dressed up so pretty?

610
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,815
That dress.

611
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:25,755
I...

612
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:27,584
I haven't seen it before.

613
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,095
It's pretty.

614
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:31,769
Thanks.

615
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,164
You went on a blind date, didn't you?

616
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,100
You're going out already?

617
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,235
A blind date?

618
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,865
Mom. Soo Ah says...

619
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,439
you can push off studying, but you don't push off romance.

620
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:45,950
Give me a break.

621
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:49,379
If you'd study and get into college, I'd set you up...

622
00:42:49,379 --> 00:42:50,974
with a boy like Seo Jun.

623
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,890
- Seo Jun? - He's a total delinquent.

624
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,989
A delinquent? Ju Kyung, no. Not a delinquent.

625
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:59,054
What do you mean? He's such a kind boy.

626
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:02,325
Mi Hyang was hospitalized for months after her kidney transplant,

627
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,700
and he took care of her the entire time.

628
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,164
He worked several jobs to pay for his tuition, his spending money,

629
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,764
and his mom's hospital bills.

630
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:10,140
Really?

631
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,034
He'd be perfect if he didn't ride a motorcycle.

632
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:15,905
Mi Hyang is very nervous about that.

633
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,304
Her husband died in a car accident.

634
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,684
Don't let Seo Jun know that you know.

635
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,244
- Really? - Yes.

636
00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:29,715
If he's such a good son, why won't he listen to her?

637
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:37,230
- Hello? - Congratulations.

638
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,399
- Darn it. - You've been selected...

639
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:40,264
That's not the call I want.

640
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,534
You morons! Do you want to lose your lives as collateral?

641
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:46,910
I'm so mad.

642
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,505
Give me that. Darn it.

643
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,045
I keep losing more and more.

644
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,184
Mona Lisa,

645
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,954
I feel your pain.

646
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,095
Oh my. It's hot.

647
00:44:15,899 --> 00:44:16,899
Gosh!

648
00:44:16,899 --> 00:44:18,865
When sparks fly up again,

649
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,664
we'll go steady.

650
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,175
No.

651
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:30,675
Anyway, she told me to buy her food.

652
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:53,264
That's refreshing.

653
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,104
Did something good happen to you?

654
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,974
Did someone ask you out?

655
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,815
Well. Actually...

656
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:05,985
I went on a blind date.

657
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:09,160
I think it went well.

658
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,089
Nice. You're all grown up. You're even going on blind dates.

659
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:14,184
My makeup skills turned my life around.

660
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,060
- Anyway. - Yes?

661
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,164
How long do you have to wait before replying to play hard to get?

662
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,529
Soo Ah told me to wait for a long while.

663
00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:21,934
It has been 30 minutes.

664
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,635
I don't play hard to get. I just go forward.

665
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,540
Don't make him wait. Reply right away.

666
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,934
- Right? - Right.

667
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,175
I take it back that I miss you.

668
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,720
Actually, I have a girlfriend.

669
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,684
I'm a piece of garbage. I wanted to cheat with you.

670
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,950
I apologize.

671
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,144
What's this?

672
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:43,120
You were rejected.

673
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,520
Who rejects a girl like that?

674
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,684
Rejected?

675
00:45:46,689 --> 00:45:48,425
- I was rejected? - I mean,

676
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:51,465
if he doesn't like you, he should say it wasn't meant to be.

677
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,025
That's all.

678
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:54,600
What garbage.

679
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,834
I see.

680
00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:58,664
I was rejected.

681
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:00,804
No wonder.

682
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:03,635
How could I get a guy with this face?

683
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,845
Blind dates rarely work out.

684
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,715
Forget him.

685
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,045
Nice.

686
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:18,160
"Hello. You told me to buy you food,"

687
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,930
"but I'd be taking your precious time,"

688
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,394
"so it would be rude of me. I'll reimburse you instead."

689
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,865
"Send me your account number"?

690
00:46:26,669 --> 00:46:27,939
What? What account number?

691
00:46:27,939 --> 00:46:29,095
You were rejected.

692
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,905
Rejected?

693
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,664
He rejected me?

694
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,104
No guy has ever done that to me.

695
00:46:40,149 --> 00:46:42,075
You can get rejected with a face like that?

696
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:47,589
Then how much prettier do I have to get?

697
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:48,815
Seriously.

698
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:51,215
Let me take a dump, will you?

699
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,655
Get out!

700
00:46:57,759 --> 00:47:01,095
How do I tell Soo Ah that I was rejected?

701
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,405
Caught you red-handed.

702
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:10,439
What are you doing?

703
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:13,075
Your mom said to stop riding your motorcycle.

704
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:14,879
I'm seriously dumbfounded.

705
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:17,080
You shouldn't ride it if your mom tells you not to.

706
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,644
Are you my mom's Mafia?

707
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,350
Mafia?

708
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,554
- You mean "spy". - Same difference.

709
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,255
They're both bad guys.

710
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:29,695
You're not the only one who has one.

711
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,525
I have one too.

712
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,295
Delete it while I'm being nice.

713
00:47:36,299 --> 00:47:38,965
Hey. Hey, Seo Jun! Seo Jun!

714
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,934
- What? Get away from me. - Delete it. Delete it now!

715
00:47:43,814 --> 00:47:45,809
I wasted so much energy.

716
00:47:50,484 --> 00:47:52,420
You were about to put your face stamp on my uniform again.

717
00:47:54,325 --> 00:47:55,489
Sorry.

718
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:58,989
Don't let your eyes wander.

719
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:00,960
What?

720
00:48:01,935 --> 00:48:03,595
I mean, don't get distracted.

721
00:48:03,595 --> 00:48:05,804
- You should study instead... - There you go again.

722
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:07,064
I memorized it all.

723
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:09,374
Taejo, Jeongjong, Taejong, Sejong, Munjong, Danjong, Sejo

724
00:48:09,374 --> 00:48:11,739
Yejong, Seongjong, Yeonsangun, Jungjong, Injong, Myeongjong, Seonjo

725
00:48:23,455 --> 00:48:25,579
- Honey. - Yes?

726
00:48:26,185 --> 00:48:27,789
Aren't you going to protect my face?

727
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:30,124
Don't get too close when we take selfies.

728
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:31,520
It's obvious when I edit it.

729
00:48:33,794 --> 00:48:35,889
I feel like I'm going out with two girls.

730
00:48:36,595 --> 00:48:39,059
The Soo Ah in front of me and the Soo Ah on Stargram.

731
00:48:40,865 --> 00:48:43,869
Then break up with the one in front of you, and date via DM.

732
00:48:44,175 --> 00:48:45,570
No.

733
00:48:46,144 --> 00:48:48,670
How can I break up with someone this cute?

734
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:56,155
Ju Kyung with a fling.

735
00:48:56,155 --> 00:48:58,584
A fling? It's not a fling.

736
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:00,225
I thought you were meeting again.

737
00:49:00,225 --> 00:49:01,650
Didn't you hit it off?

738
00:49:02,725 --> 00:49:06,520
Well... I heard from him after I chatted with you.

739
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:08,989
And...

740
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:12,000
he's kind of weird.

741
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:14,259
Why? What did he say? Let me see.

742
00:49:17,075 --> 00:49:18,300
Here.

743
00:49:19,604 --> 00:49:21,710
"I take it back that I miss you."

744
00:49:21,745 --> 00:49:24,170
"Actually, I have a girlfriend."

745
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:26,639
"I'm a piece of garbage. I wanted to cheat with you."

746
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:28,280
"I apologize."

747
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:30,849
- What a punk. - Were you rejected?

748
00:49:32,254 --> 00:49:34,524
How do you get rejected so quickly?

749
00:49:34,524 --> 00:49:36,194
- How does that happen? - It's too quick.

750
00:49:36,194 --> 00:49:37,520
Love isn't that easy.

751
00:49:38,464 --> 00:49:39,659
So funny.

752
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:44,630
That high school girl? I'm not sure.

753
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:48,630
She has a nice body, but her face is okay.

754
00:49:49,274 --> 00:49:51,444
But she's so naive.

755
00:49:51,444 --> 00:49:53,539
She'll be really easy.

756
00:49:55,144 --> 00:49:56,909
I'll play with her for a bit.

757
00:49:58,444 --> 00:49:59,579
Who are you?

758
00:49:59,785 --> 00:50:01,214
Hey!

759
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:02,650
Take that back right now.

760
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:06,550
I take it back. I take back everything I said.

761
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:08,789
I take it back. Satisfied? Okay, then...

762
00:50:09,194 --> 00:50:10,520
(Sung Nyung)

763
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:12,289
(Third Auntie: Home yet? Miss you.)

764
00:50:12,624 --> 00:50:13,860
What's your problem?

765
00:50:13,865 --> 00:50:15,530
Hey! Ouch! Wait!

766
00:50:16,234 --> 00:50:18,104
That hurts. I have a bad shoulder.

767
00:50:18,104 --> 00:50:19,259
You scumbag.

768
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:26,500
Ta-da.

769
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:29,009
Nice.

770
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:37,880
What is he doing? Is he showing them my picture?

771
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:41,119
- What is that? - Oh my gosh.

772
00:50:41,225 --> 00:50:43,225
- Really? - No, no.

773
00:50:43,225 --> 00:50:44,389
For real?

774
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:52,530
What...

775
00:50:53,265 --> 00:50:54,730
- Hold it right. - Hey!

776
00:50:56,035 --> 00:50:57,199
Hey.

777
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:58,874
Darn it.

778
00:50:58,874 --> 00:51:00,070
Ju Kyung!

779
00:51:01,175 --> 00:51:03,139
Hey! Ju Kyung!

780
00:51:03,575 --> 00:51:05,444
Give it back when I'm being nice. Give it back.

781
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:07,440
I said, give it back!

782
00:51:10,584 --> 00:51:12,820
- Hand it over. - Hand over what?

783
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:15,349
I saw you take it.

784
00:51:18,564 --> 00:51:20,989
- What are you doing? - I could ask you the same thing.

785
00:51:26,635 --> 00:51:28,000
Stop!

786
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:31,539
You're about to fight in front of me again, right?

787
00:51:36,175 --> 00:51:37,984
Please don't.

788
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:39,845
Here's your key.

789
00:51:39,845 --> 00:51:42,885
Now get away from each other. You go that way and you go that way.

790
00:51:42,885 --> 00:51:45,119
And I'll go this way!

791
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:56,265
Our tutor makes it easy to understand.

792
00:51:56,265 --> 00:51:58,699
Will my days as a loser in math finally be over?

793
00:51:59,064 --> 00:52:01,369
You can do it, you know.

794
00:52:01,604 --> 00:52:04,070
So don't give up. We both shouldn't.

795
00:52:04,874 --> 00:52:06,845
- Got it. - So Soo Jin,

796
00:52:06,845 --> 00:52:09,670
can my friend from Shinhwa High for Boys join?

797
00:52:10,944 --> 00:52:13,784
Shinhwa High for Boys? Who is this so-called friend?

798
00:52:13,785 --> 00:52:16,854
A trillion question marks are dancing in my brain right now.

799
00:52:16,854 --> 00:52:18,024
Why let a stranger join us?

800
00:52:18,024 --> 00:52:20,524
Isn't it obvious? For Ju Kyung to flirt with.

801
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:22,250
Dating is a must

802
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:25,219
Marriage is optional, amor fati

803
00:52:37,274 --> 00:52:39,345
What on earth? I thought you weren't interested.

804
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:41,340
I never said I wouldn't join though.

805
00:52:42,044 --> 00:52:43,539
- What? - My gosh.

806
00:52:44,144 --> 00:52:46,980
The two smartest kids in our class are in our study group.

807
00:52:47,644 --> 00:52:49,679
We're like the Avengers.

808
00:53:01,225 --> 00:53:02,989
How can you not know the basics?

809
00:53:04,834 --> 00:53:06,960
Well, that's how I am.

810
00:53:11,175 --> 00:53:14,599
As N tends to infinity, it ends up being N over N squared.

811
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:16,570
That's 1 over N, so the limit value is 0.

812
00:53:16,914 --> 00:53:20,780
Meanwhile, if it's N squared over N, the value will be N...

813
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:24,009
which will go to infinity.

814
00:53:31,624 --> 00:53:33,964
- What is it? - How can you fit all this...

815
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:35,759
in the small head of yours?

816
00:53:36,495 --> 00:53:38,659
How smart are you? Do you have an IQ of over 150?

817
00:53:38,734 --> 00:53:40,699
Why can't you focus even for a few minutes?

818
00:53:41,104 --> 00:53:43,734
I bet you have a two digit IQ. FYI, a dolphin's IQ is 80.

819
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:45,475
- Are dolphins that smart? - Work hard...

820
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:46,570
if you want to be smarter.

821
00:53:49,544 --> 00:53:50,909
Focus.

822
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:56,050
So what will the answer be?

823
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:15,170
Lucky her.

824
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:19,940
When did you and Soo Ho get so close?

825
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:22,770
He's not the type to help others study.

826
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,469
Is this what you call being close?

827
00:54:26,015 --> 00:54:28,150
- From his standard. - Well, you see...

828
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:32,980
Actually, I don't know why.

829
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:37,150
Maybe it's because I'm pretty awful at math.

830
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:40,989
Trying to show off, is he?

831
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:48,059
Guys, to celebrate our first study session...

832
00:54:48,635 --> 00:54:51,000
- Let's go karaokeing. - I'm in.

833
00:54:51,774 --> 00:54:53,004
You've been waiting for this, haven't you?

834
00:54:53,004 --> 00:54:55,110
Come on, let's go!

835
00:54:55,544 --> 00:54:56,969
You're not going, are you?

836
00:54:58,484 --> 00:54:59,980
A few minutes won't hurt.

837
00:55:03,285 --> 00:55:06,624
- Jjin, jjin, jjin, jjin, it's real - Jjin, jjin, jjin, jjin, it's real

838
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:08,920
- It's the real deal - It's the real deal

839
00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:13,659
- The real deal is here - The real deal is here

840
00:55:15,734 --> 00:55:18,730
- Jjin, jjin, jjin, jjin, it's real - Jjin, jjin, jjin, jjin, it's real

841
00:55:19,135 --> 00:55:21,929
- It's the real deal - It's the real deal

842
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:26,144
- We'll love with passion - We'll love with passion

843
00:55:26,144 --> 00:55:28,975
- Cheer up, baby, cheer up, baby - Cheer up, baby, cheer up, baby

844
00:55:28,975 --> 00:55:31,239
Cheer up!

845
00:55:31,345 --> 00:55:34,179
A girl shouldn't give out her heart so easily

846
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,115
You'll end up liking me more

847
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:39,524
No, I'm all right, so don't feel burdened

848
00:55:39,524 --> 00:55:43,055
I don't have a boyfriend anyway

849
00:55:43,055 --> 00:55:46,194
But why haven't you said anything yet?

850
00:55:46,194 --> 00:55:49,265
- When I see you - When I see you

851
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:53,030
- Every time I see you - Every time I see you

852
00:55:53,035 --> 00:55:56,635
- Like a cold dish of naengmyeon - Like a cold dish of naengmyeon

853
00:55:56,635 --> 00:56:00,239
- The noodles are icy - The noodles are icy

854
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,314
- Still, I love you - Still, I love you

855
00:56:02,314 --> 00:56:04,745
- Nice! - Hey, yo!

856
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:08,380
- Sweet young lady - Hey, you, hey

857
00:56:08,414 --> 00:56:11,480
- You - Hey, fire!

858
00:56:13,885 --> 00:56:15,349
My friend

859
00:56:17,095 --> 00:56:21,929
At times, I forget

860
00:56:23,435 --> 00:56:29,130
I meet with friends like I'm not fazed

861
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:31,429
Gosh, he's good.

862
00:56:32,175 --> 00:56:33,739
He could be a singer.

863
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:35,539
Too much

864
00:56:35,814 --> 00:56:39,280
- The song sounds familiar though. - The longing feeling

865
00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:41,340
Where have I heard it before?

866
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:46,179
How do you do?

867
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:49,894
How have you been?

868
00:56:49,894 --> 00:56:53,765
It doesn't seem

869
00:56:53,765 --> 00:56:55,989
Like I'm all right

870
00:57:00,205 --> 00:57:03,405
Being away for so long brought me back to new faces.

871
00:57:03,405 --> 00:57:06,199
- You're so handsome. - I'm in awe!

872
00:57:06,705 --> 00:57:09,610
We should all grab dinner sometime so that I can learn their faces.

873
00:57:10,975 --> 00:57:12,380
Let's have a seat then.

874
00:57:12,414 --> 00:57:14,280
- Shall we begin the meeting? - Sure.

875
00:57:17,314 --> 00:57:18,754
In memory of Jeong Se Yeon...

876
00:57:18,754 --> 00:57:20,155
on the first anniversary of his death,

877
00:57:20,155 --> 00:57:21,955
we propose the release of an album.

878
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:24,055
Rather than promoting the comeback N-6IX...

879
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:25,920
without Se Yeon,

880
00:57:26,024 --> 00:57:29,194
we believe it'll be better to comfort his fans and teammates...

881
00:57:29,194 --> 00:57:31,829
with a night to remember him.

882
00:57:32,734 --> 00:57:36,304
These are the song we found in the file Se Yeon left behind.

883
00:57:36,305 --> 00:57:37,900
Se Yeon wrote the lyrics...

884
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:40,599
and the song was written by someone named Leo.

885
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:42,869
I like the song.

886
00:57:43,975 --> 00:57:45,210
Leo, is it?

887
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:49,055
The songwriter's identity is still a mystery,

888
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,650
so we've been trying to track him down.

889
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:03,829
Isn't that Seo Jun's motorcycle?

890
00:58:06,405 --> 00:58:08,059
Is he somewhere nearby?

891
00:58:12,374 --> 00:58:13,739
I was right.

892
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:16,239
I see he rode it again.

893
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:19,179
This darn motorcycle.

894
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:21,409
Han Seo Jun, you jerk.

895
00:58:22,055 --> 00:58:23,780
I'll mangle it up.

896
00:58:24,285 --> 00:58:25,449
What do you think you're doing?

897
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:29,489
What? It's nothing.

898
00:58:31,055 --> 00:58:32,325
What did you do to my motorcycle?

899
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:33,659
I didn't even touch it.

900
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:35,759
Darn.

901
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:41,805
Hey, come here for a second.

902
00:58:41,805 --> 00:58:43,270
What? Why?

903
00:58:48,944 --> 00:58:50,070
What is it?

904
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,710
I thought it'd be better to talk here.

905
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:57,184
- Must it be said in secret? - Yes.

906
00:58:57,185 --> 00:59:00,179
Hold on. Seo Jun, is that you?

907
00:59:03,925 --> 00:59:05,394
You of all people?

908
00:59:05,394 --> 00:59:06,590
Surprise.

909
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:09,130
You piece of crap.

910
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:12,429
You...

911
00:59:12,705 --> 00:59:14,699
Why did he of all people had to show up here?

912
00:59:15,604 --> 00:59:16,635
Hold on a second.

913
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:19,369
Why did you bring a girl down a dark alley?

914
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:21,739
Get going.

915
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,940
What do I do?

916
00:59:28,185 --> 00:59:30,914
- What... - Get him!

917
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:33,980
- Get him. - Stop!

918
00:59:34,955 --> 00:59:37,050
Get back here!

919
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:41,590
Get back here.

920
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:45,500
- Stop right there. - Hey!

921
00:59:58,544 --> 01:00:00,679
Get back here!

922
01:00:02,484 --> 01:00:04,679
- After them. - Darn it.

923
01:00:07,425 --> 01:00:09,024
- Stop! - Over here.

924
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:11,420
- Get them. - Where are they?

925
01:00:12,124 --> 01:00:13,389
Seriously?

926
01:00:26,644 --> 01:00:28,369
Where did they go?

927
01:00:36,984 --> 01:00:38,349
- What the... - Where did they go?

928
01:00:45,064 --> 01:00:47,889
Wait. He goes to Saebom High too.

929
01:01:02,314 --> 01:01:04,039
They're gone. The coast is clear.

930
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:08,079
Hey, I told you to leave. Why did you drag me away?

931
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:10,079
What would those guys think?

932
01:01:13,124 --> 01:01:14,524
What would they think?

933
01:01:14,524 --> 01:01:17,420
Wouldn't they think it's weird if we ran away?

934
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:19,920
Are you dumb or what?

935
01:01:20,624 --> 01:01:22,893
I saved you from trouble, and you call me dumb?

936
01:01:22,894 --> 01:01:25,305
Hey! Do you know who comes after Sejong the Great?

937
01:01:25,305 --> 01:01:27,630
- Gojong. - What happened to the 400 years?

938
01:01:27,765 --> 01:01:29,730
- You're dumber than I am. - What?

939
01:01:31,135 --> 01:01:33,770
Who are you? Why did you chase us?

940
01:01:36,975 --> 01:01:38,170
Where are you going?

941
01:01:38,374 --> 01:01:39,579
Are you Seo Jun's friend?

942
01:01:40,115 --> 01:01:41,880
Or are you his minion?

943
01:01:43,615 --> 01:01:44,914
- Get out of my way. - Come on.

944
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:47,849
I'll let you leave if you call him here.

945
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:51,750
- Why should I do that? - I'm sure he'll show up...

946
01:01:51,865 --> 01:01:53,159
if his friend calls.

947
01:01:53,394 --> 01:01:55,194
- Don't you think so? - He won't answer my call.

948
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:56,559
Then let's check.

949
01:01:57,194 --> 01:01:58,460
Take his cell phone.

950
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:00,659
Let's see. Just a second.

951
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:03,730
It's here.

952
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,039
Did you just stop me?

953
01:02:08,305 --> 01:02:09,469
Let go.

954
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,380
Gosh, seriously?

955
01:02:14,345 --> 01:02:15,610
What are you doing?

956
01:02:15,615 --> 01:02:17,449
- Get up. - Where do you think you're going?

957
01:02:17,455 --> 01:02:19,050
Let go. Let go!

958
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:21,550
You little punk.

959
01:02:24,425 --> 01:02:27,464
- Hey, hold him tight! - Hold him!

960
01:02:27,464 --> 01:02:28,889
- You go. - My gosh.

961
01:02:29,365 --> 01:02:30,694
- I'm sorry! - Are you kidding me?

962
01:02:30,694 --> 01:02:32,929
You aim for the top, I'll aim for the bottom.

963
01:02:33,564 --> 01:02:35,829
Get off me! Get off!

964
01:02:36,075 --> 01:02:37,273
Let go!

965
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:38,429
Let go of me!

966
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:42,909
Hey, hold onto him!

967
01:02:44,814 --> 01:02:46,144
Hold him tight!

968
01:02:46,144 --> 01:02:47,940
Hold onto him! Stay still!

969
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:54,449
You must be out of your mind. Do you have a death wish?

970
01:02:55,794 --> 01:02:56,825
What are you doing?

971
01:02:56,825 --> 01:02:58,664
Darn it. Let's get out of here.

972
01:02:58,664 --> 01:02:59,889
Let's go.

973
01:03:13,004 --> 01:03:14,139
Hey.

974
01:03:14,644 --> 01:03:15,745
What do you want?

975
01:03:15,745 --> 01:03:17,914
Can you lend me money?

976
01:03:17,914 --> 01:03:19,009
No.

977
01:03:19,185 --> 01:03:22,254
My friends left with my bag because I didn't show up.

978
01:03:22,254 --> 01:03:24,550
My cell phone and wallet are all in my bag.

979
01:03:24,615 --> 01:03:26,449
Good going.

980
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:29,725
I saved you, so just think of it as repaying me.

981
01:03:29,725 --> 01:03:32,293
Can you please just lend me the bus fare?

982
01:03:32,294 --> 01:03:33,690
Repay you? Are you joking?

983
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:35,460
No. You can walk home.

984
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:38,929
You cold-hearted jerk.

985
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:49,739
Hey.

986
01:03:51,914 --> 01:03:53,444
Hop on before I change my mind.

987
01:03:53,444 --> 01:03:54,610
Really?

988
01:03:55,455 --> 01:03:56,710
Thank you.

989
01:04:00,854 --> 01:04:02,520
How do I get on this thing?

990
01:04:04,495 --> 01:04:05,920
Like this?

991
01:04:06,725 --> 01:04:07,920
Hold on tight.

992
01:04:23,374 --> 01:04:30,909
(Prince Comics)

993
01:04:42,365 --> 01:04:44,389
Here. Thanks.

994
01:04:45,664 --> 01:04:48,230
If you really thank me, delete the photo.

995
01:04:50,405 --> 01:04:51,599
Ju Kyung.

996
01:04:57,874 --> 01:05:00,179
I went through all that mess to make sure they don't meet.

997
01:05:00,214 --> 01:05:02,009
Were you guys married in your past lives?

998
01:05:02,984 --> 01:05:04,210
It's you again?

999
01:05:04,214 --> 01:05:06,449
- Why did you give her a ride? - What about you?

1000
01:05:06,754 --> 01:05:08,050
Why were you waiting for her?

1001
01:05:12,294 --> 01:05:16,090
Okay, guys. Why don't we all go home?

1002
01:05:16,095 --> 01:05:17,095
It's late.

1003
01:05:17,095 --> 01:05:19,334
You go that way, and you go that way.

1004
01:05:19,334 --> 01:05:20,829
Let's go different ways.

1005
01:05:21,905 --> 01:05:23,070
Hey.

1006
01:05:24,104 --> 01:05:25,329
Hee Kyung.

1007
01:05:27,274 --> 01:05:28,500
What am I seeing?

1008
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:32,539
Why am I seeing two beautiful men?

1009
01:05:36,555 --> 01:05:37,949
Am I dead?

1010
01:05:38,314 --> 01:05:40,250
Am I in paradise?

1011
01:05:41,885 --> 01:05:43,050
Hee Kyung.

1012
01:05:43,794 --> 01:05:44,949
Hee Kyung.

1013
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,360
Let's go!

1014
01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:52,659
I'll help you guys make a debut!

1015
01:05:52,705 --> 01:05:53,860
Hee Kyung.

1016
01:05:55,874 --> 01:05:57,374
This is crazy.

1017
01:05:57,374 --> 01:06:00,170
Will you please wake up?

1018
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,139
I'll kill you if you puke.

1019
01:06:04,615 --> 01:06:05,980
Let's take her home.

1020
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:07,809
Why do I need to go? Hey.

1021
01:06:08,314 --> 01:06:09,650
Why do I need to help?

1022
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:10,980
My gosh, darn it.

1023
01:06:11,254 --> 01:06:13,420
Hee Kyung, you're dead once you wake up.

1024
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:15,794
Let's go!

1025
01:06:15,794 --> 01:06:17,454
Shut her mouth. Just try shutting her mouth.

1026
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:18,690
Come on!

1027
01:06:19,595 --> 01:06:21,820
Let's get going!

1028
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:25,999
We're home. This is it.

1029
01:06:26,664 --> 01:06:28,135
Thank you so much.

1030
01:06:28,135 --> 01:06:30,200
I'll never forget this, guys.

1031
01:06:30,275 --> 01:06:31,429
No!

1032
01:06:56,864 --> 01:06:57,935
I'm so sorry.

1033
01:06:57,935 --> 01:06:59,660
I'll wash it nice and clean. No.

1034
01:06:59,664 --> 01:07:01,764
I'll just burn this and get you a new one.

1035
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:03,330
I'm so sorry. Bye, guys.

1036
01:07:19,555 --> 01:07:20,749
Soo Ho.

1037
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,160
Do you like Ju Kyung?

1038
01:07:32,404 --> 01:07:34,530
- What? - Don't you like her?

1039
01:07:38,574 --> 01:07:39,770
What about you?

1040
01:07:40,275 --> 01:07:42,339
Why do you keep hanging around her?

1041
01:07:45,485 --> 01:07:46,740
Do you like Ju Kyung?

1042
01:07:51,555 --> 01:07:52,820
I think I might.

1043
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:29,450
(Unstoppable energy)

1044
01:08:34,124 --> 01:08:35,320
(Test ID: Lee Soo Ho)

1045
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:52,009
What are you doing? Where are you going?

1046
01:09:04,855 --> 01:09:08,490
(Unstoppable energy)

1047
01:09:09,735 --> 01:09:10,990
Do you like Ju Kyung?

1048
01:09:49,305 --> 01:09:50,469
Here. Take it.

1049
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:53,504
- What? - You told me to stop...

1050
01:09:53,504 --> 01:09:54,839
riding my motorcycle.

1051
01:09:55,975 --> 01:09:57,240
Did you hear that?

1052
01:09:59,414 --> 01:10:02,910
Starting from today, I'm only going to listen to you.

1053
01:10:07,784 --> 01:10:09,794
What was that? Did he just ask you out?

1054
01:10:09,794 --> 01:10:11,990
Does Seo Jun like Ju Kyung?

1055
01:10:12,254 --> 01:10:13,490
I can't believe this.

1056
01:10:14,324 --> 01:10:15,660
Seo Jun.

1057
01:10:15,895 --> 01:10:17,089
Don't go.

1058
01:10:20,935 --> 01:10:22,629
- Let me just... - Just don't go.

1059
01:10:49,695 --> 01:10:50,935
(We thank Kim Hye Yoon and Lee Jae Wook...)

1060
01:10:50,935 --> 01:10:52,290
(for their special appearance.)

1061
01:11:14,084 --> 01:11:16,889
(True Beauty)

1062
01:11:17,855 --> 01:11:19,089
Sit.

1063
01:11:19,364 --> 01:11:22,089
- You put on that mask... - Pork cutlet.

1064
01:11:22,294 --> 01:11:24,059
Now Lee Soo Ho and Han Seo Jun?

1065
01:11:24,195 --> 01:11:25,559
I'm going to punch your mouth.

1066
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:26,730
What?

1067
01:11:27,464 --> 01:11:29,570
Look at that!

1068
01:11:32,105 --> 01:11:33,999
Don't run away because you're scared.

1069
01:11:34,744 --> 01:11:35,910
Hey.

1070
01:11:35,914 --> 01:11:37,809
It was all my fault.

1071
01:11:38,015 --> 01:11:41,080
But don't toy with Ju Kyung.

1072
01:11:41,584 --> 01:11:42,910
Oh no.
