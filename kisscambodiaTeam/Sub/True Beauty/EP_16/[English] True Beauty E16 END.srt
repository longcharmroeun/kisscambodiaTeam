00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,899
FINAL EPISODE

2
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:18,830
You didn't have to walk me home.

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,670
It's because we're a guy and a girl today.

4
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,740
I wouldn't if we were friends.

5
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,681
You live too close to the station.

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,550
What do you mean? It's so far.

7
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:35,821
No, it isn't. It's super close.

8
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,720
We're here.

9
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,590
Get home safely.

10
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:43,361
Ju Kyung.

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,790
Yes?

12
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:49,001
I'm...

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,001
using my wish.

14
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:16,232
PRINCE COMICS

15
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,621
Seo Jun, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:51,531
We still have a few dates left.

17
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,430
You should head inside.

18
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,571
Do you still like Ju Kyung?

19
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:39,840
Did you ask her out?

20
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,111
No. We're going out.

21
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,221
I know you're lying.

22
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:51,650
What do you know?

23
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:58,590
I told you I met her yesterday.

24
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,661
Why did it have to be yesterday?

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,430
- Because of the first snow.
- What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,101
You guys aren't going out, are you?

27
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:12,270
You must be a little nervous.

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,780
- No.
- You little punk.

29
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,821
I can't believe they hugged each other.

30
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:02,261
But we broke up.

31
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,861
I haven't missed you at all.

32
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:46,901
Hey, you're up.

33
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

34
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,940
Who gave you these flowers?

35
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,310
Do you have a boyfriend?

36
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:54,041
No.

37
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:56,711
I saw it in your room, and I brought it out.

38
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,180
I didn't want it to wither.

39
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,651
I totally forgot about it.

40
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:09,390
Flowers are pretty when they're in a vase.

41
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:12,430
But I feel bad for them when they
wither without receiving any love.

42
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,911
Are you busy?

43
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,310
I'm at your agency.

44
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,880
Can we meet after you finish practicing?

45
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,250
I'll wait for you in the lobby.

46
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:42,161
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU IN THE LOBBY.

47
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,841
Seo Jun.

48
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,781
Why didn't you leave
after seeing me not reply?

49
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,450
You've been waiting here for hours.

50
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,810
Well...

51
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,880
- You see...
- Yes, I see you. What is it?

52
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,021
Did you eat?

53
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,890
Should we go eat?

54
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,390
Are you asking me out on a date?

55
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,291
I'm busy today.

56
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,961
I need to tell you something.

57
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:21,200
You can save that for next time.

58
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:23,260
I'm too busy today...

59
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,870
to go on a date.

60
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,630
Let's just settle with this.

61
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:45,721
Seo Jun.

62
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,161
By the way, did you hear?

63
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,760
Soo Ho's going back to the States tonight.

64
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,000
- What?
- He apparently came here...

65
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,300
to take care of things
after his dad got better.

66
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:02,341
You'd better get going if you want
to catch him before he leaves.

67
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,940
Why are you just standing there?

68
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:09,341
You should get going. You
don't want to miss him.

69
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:14,651
Go. Get going already.

70
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,221
Go on.

71
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,050
See you.

72
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:50,851
The doors are closing.

73
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,890
What's this?

74
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:29,260
Why are you suddenly studying so hard?

75
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,291
Blow out the candle. I'm
not going to sing a song.

76
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,900
Happy birthday to you

77
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,711
Happy birthday to you

78
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,170
I thought you weren't going to sing.

79
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:51,510
Ju Kyung.

80
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:53,111
Yes?

81
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
Which number are you going to pick
for the questions you don't know?

82
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,351
Let's see. Number three?

83
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,750
Then I should pick
everything else but that one.

84
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,861
Wait.

85
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,961
Here.

86
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:07,691
Don't get too nervous and good luck.

87
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:09,331
Thanks.

88
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,140
Here. Good luck to you too.

89
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,941
Okay.

90
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,341
2021 COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC ABILITY TEST

91
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,611
Here we go.

92
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:29,351
1, 2, 3.

93
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,250
- You guys.
- Why do you all look so awkward?

94
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,290
You guys look too sad.

95
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,620
- Look more natural.
- Okay, fine.

96
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,390
- Let's be cute.
- Ready?

97
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,290
- 1, 2, 3.
- Goodbye, Saebom High School!

98
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,130
- Okay.
- Ju Kyung.

99
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:40,961
Aren't you going to take a photo with me?

100
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:42,201
My gosh, Seo Jun.

101
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,801
Why are you interrupting?

102
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,301
Okay, Seo Jun.

103
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,471
We'll take a photo of you
together. Stand right here.

104
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,400
- Go on.
- Stand there.

105
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,571
- My gosh.
- Nice shot.

106
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,711
- Get ready.
- Stand close to each other.

107
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:55,481
- Stand close.
- 1, 2, 3.

108
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,581
My gosh.

109
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,910
- My gosh, come on.
- Give me a proper pose.

110
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:02,650
- Let's try one more time.
- Hey, let's take a proper photo.

111
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,790
Here we go. 1, 2, 3.

112
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,140
Soo Ho's going back to the States tonight.

113
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,091
BICYCLE CROSSING

114
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:01,170
Taxi!

115
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,711
Taxi!

116
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:10,250
My gosh.

117
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,701
Soo Ho! Soo Ho!

118
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:26,301
Are you gone already?

119
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,000
You jerk.

120
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,540
Why did you come back if
you were going to leave?

121
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,841
Why did you follow me around?

122
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:38,410
My gosh.

123
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,851
Ju Kyung.

124
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:48,420
Don't go.

125
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,601
Please don't go.

126
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,301
I won't let you go.

127
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,971
So please don't leave.

128
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:09,140
I'm not going anywhere.

129
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,311
Don't you dare.

130
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,620
So don't cry.

131
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,301
- Don't go.
- I won't.

132
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,941
I didn't show it,

133
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:39,510
but I was insanely nervous.

134
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,740
- About what?
- That you'd refuse...

135
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,951
to see me.

136
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,010
Liar.

137
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,520
It's true.

138
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,221
You were planning to leave today.

139
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,551
What do you mean?

140
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,321
I heard you were going
back to the US tonight.

141
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,861
Why would I?

142
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,530
What's with your luggage?

143
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,601
I was unpacking.

144
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:05,801
What do you mean? Seo Jun
said you were going back...

145
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,841
He said that?

146
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:15,941
Well...

147
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:18,211
Did you run over here thinking I was leaving?

148
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,451
- No, that's not it.
- To stop me?

149
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,981
That's not it.

150
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:25,951
Ju Kyung. Ju Kyung!

151
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,790
- Why are you running away?
- I am not.

152
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,030
Didn't you come to see me?

153
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:37,760
I have to go home. It's very important.

154
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,801
That's not the way.

155
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:44,841
I'll take you home.

156
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:51,380
Do you hate me?

157
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:54,681
Won't you let me see your face?

158
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,750
You were coming back anyway.

159
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,150
You came back anyway.

160
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,490
So why did you do that?

161
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,160
Because it would be...

162
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:09,931
too hard for you to wait.

163
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:13,101
It was much harder...

164
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:16,201
than waiting.

165
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,721
It was...

166
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,691
so hard for me too.

167
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,760
That's why...

168
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,101
I was looking for a way to come back.

169
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,801
Even if my dad didn't wake up,

170
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:49,071
I would've come back to you.

171
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,941
What if I had gotten over you?

172
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,811
I would've followed you around.

173
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,111
What if I still said no?

174
00:14:57,611 --> 00:14:59,510
I would've cried and begged,

175
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,081
and tried to seduce you.

176
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:05,650
Ju Kyung.

177
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:08,920
Please look at me.

178
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:12,861
I'm sorry for making you...

179
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:17,530
suffer.

180
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:19,530
Why are you sorry?

181
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,900
I know how you felt.

182
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,341
I do, but seeing you again,

183
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,181
I'm reminded of how much it hurt.

184
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,481
I'm sorry for hurting you.

185
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,250
You were hurting too.

186
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,890
It must've been so hard in that faraway land.

187
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:41,691
You had no other family.

188
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:45,760
You were in the hospital
alone, unable to do anything.

189
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:47,760
It must've hurt so much.

190
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,731
I was so worried, that I
wanted to fly over, but...

191
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:57,701
An 18-year-old has no money.

192
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,081
We were too young,

193
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,191
- weren't we?
- Yes.

194
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,750
Don't cry.

195
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:17,321
Come here.

196
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,000
It's shocking enough that they were dating.

197
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,801
It's amazing that they're getting married.

198
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,571
I know. Who else could handle
my sister other than Mr. Han?

199
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:41,451
What are you staring at?

200
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,681
What? It's just...

201
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,620
you've changed a lot.

202
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,890
You even drive now.

203
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,571
I still have this too.

204
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:01,301
You didn't throw it away.

205
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,741
We're the same.

206
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,041
What?

207
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,081
We haven't changed...

208
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,581
from before.

209
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,220
From before, when?

210
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,051
When you were a crybaby?

211
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,291
I cried once. Stop calling me a crybaby.

212
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,561
You really are a crybaby.

213
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,561
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

214
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,831
I wouldn't have known if I didn't
see the writing on the wall.

215
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,400
I wanted to tell you on a
special day, but couldn't.

216
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,101
You should've just told me.

217
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,410
I liked you when I was a kid too.

218
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:46,910
I used to wait for you at the
comic book store every day.

219
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,521
I guess it wasn't one-sided...

220
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,051
if you remembered me.

221
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:55,861
I didn't like you.

222
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:59,031
I only remember you as the
comic book store crybaby.

223
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:04,230
That's sad. I guess it
was an unrequited love.

224
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:08,741
How do you feel? Are you still sick?

225
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,400
What do you mean?

226
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,111
I wasn't sick.

227
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,910
You ended up in the ER.
How's your constipation?

228
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,281
It's fine.

229
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,120
You should exercise often
and eat a lot of fiber.

230
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,180
You need probiotics and lots of water.

231
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:26,620
You need to do that regularly
so you don't get constipated...

232
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,591
Hey. Must you kill the
mood by talking about that?

233
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:30,561
It's so embarrassing.

234
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,930
It's because I've been under a lot of stress.

235
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,061
People with active digestive
systems are usually very active.

236
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,400
Pull over. I'll walk home as a workout.

237
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,271
Yes. Over there. You can drop me off there.

238
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,541
Pull over there.

239
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,380
- Hey.
- Are you on your way home?

240
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:00,180
Yes, I am.

241
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:02,150
- Aren't you tired?
- Not at all.

242
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Is it hard to talk because you're driving?

243
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,720
- Want to call me when you get home?
- No.

244
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,761
It's fine.

245
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,690
I want to keep hearing your voice.

246
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,160
What are you doing tomorrow?

247
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:21,331
Why?

248
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,541
I want to go see you.

249
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:25,410
It seems like a dream...

250
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,370
that I can see you tomorrow.

251
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,281
For me too.

252
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:47,106
When you start the chorus,

253
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:49,146
- give a drum roll.
- Here.

254
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:50,777
- To explode.
- Yes.

255
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:53,247
And here, the guitar...

256
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:56,686
- Don't pause on D, go right in.
- Go right in.

257
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:00,257
Why did you have to come out right then?

258
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,527
You made me look lame.

259
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:07,497
- What do you mean?
- Unbelievable.

260
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:12,237
Today was my last chance, you know.

261
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:16,507
What I didn't do two years
ago... Telling her how I feel...

262
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,277
and getting rejected.

263
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:21,146
I finally got to do it.

264
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,237
What are you doing here?

265
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,317
I'm not busy today,

266
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,047
so I'll let you say what
you couldn't yesterday.

267
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:04,856
I honestly don't know what to say.

268
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,126
As if.

269
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:09,626
It's already written all over your face.

270
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:12,866
You've always been one to wear
your heart on your sleeves.

271
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,096
All I can say to you...

272
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:18,267
is that I'm grateful and sorry.

273
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:20,507
As if that's something to be sorry about.

274
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:23,136
I was aware...

275
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:25,606
that you weren't over Soo Ho.

276
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:29,217
So don't be sorry.

277
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:32,916
You had no room for me in your heart,

278
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:35,356
but I tried getting greedy for once.

279
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:37,787
I'm sorry.

280
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,356
I'm the one who should apologize...

281
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:42,156
for confusing you by telling you how I feel.

282
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:46,096
You must want me to mean that,

283
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,797
but that'd be ridiculous.

284
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:49,737
I should at least tell you how I feel.

285
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:54,507
Your brother once said to me...

286
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:58,076
that getting rejected helps you to move on.

287
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:02,477
Don't worry though. My debut is imminent,

288
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:04,447
so I won't have time to think about you.

289
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,186
I'll move on quicker than you think.

290
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:11,317
Keep holding that expression
though, and I'll go.

291
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,457
- Should I?
- Okay, let's finish our drinks.

292
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,497
- It'll be on me.
- Got it.

293
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,447
Let's go.

294
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,977
Are you playing me for a fool already?

295
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,717
- Please let me go.
- I'll bet all my aroma candles...

296
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:42,616
on you having not-so-innocent intentions.

297
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:43,686
What will you bet in return?

298
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,886
Stop that already!

299
00:23:47,457 --> 00:23:48,896
What are you doing in that suit of yours?

300
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,797
I wanted to practice walking
Hee Kyung down the aisle.

301
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,866
What for? She and Joon Woo
will be doing that themselves.

302
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,436
Breakfast is ready!

303
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,267
Why though?

304
00:23:58,267 --> 00:23:59,967
A lot of couples do that these days.

305
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,366
You're here again, Soo Ho?

306
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,606
Did you sleep in again?

307
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:05,406
You've been here almost
every day for the past month.

308
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:08,947
Why don't you just marry her instead?

309
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:11,876
You must think you're immune to pain.

310
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:13,987
It'll be nice to get it over with.

311
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,317
I won't allow it so easily.

312
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:17,616
When should I pick you up today?

313
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:20,386
It's all right. You'll probably be too tired.

314
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,686
I'll be fine.

315
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,797
It's what I expected from you.

316
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,727
Back is the man who is
young, rich, and handsome.

317
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,326
I envy how you don't have
to work to earn money.

318
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:30,197
Your CSAT should be what
you only think about.

319
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,967
I studied until after midnight last night.

320
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:34,106
Nobody's more desperate than I am right now.

321
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,307
As if Go Woon will wait
until you get into college.

322
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,277
Must you be so annoying, you jerk?

323
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,947
You jerk? To your sister?

324
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:43,616
Why do you keep acting
like his brother-in-law?

325
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:44,947
Now, dig in.

326
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,047
Sure.

327
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,116
MOVE ENTERTAINMENT

328
00:24:49,116 --> 00:24:51,086
NEW IDOL GROUP MAKEUP CONCEPT CONTEST

329
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,257
A makeup concept contest
for a new idol group?

330
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,366
Chen, filming has been pushed back a little.

331
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,297
- Can you wait?
- Sure.

332
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,336
Just a second. Hello?

333
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:12,507
Ju Kyung, are you and Seo Jun dating?

334
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:14,876
No.

335
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:18,346
Of course. I knew he had high standards.

336
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:21,487
That's right. And because
of his high standards,

337
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,957
he'd never date just about anyone.

338
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:26,557
Mist.

339
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,257
Enough!

340
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,467
I didn't know I was at a
sauna. Go easy on it, will you?

341
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,547
Why does she have to follow us everywhere?

342
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,017
She only takes up room in the van.

343
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,846
It's not like she does any work.

344
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:53,886
She's an intern and needs to learn the ropes.

345
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,886
I know, but why does it
have to be on my time?

346
00:25:57,116 --> 00:26:00,287
Even professionals can't meet
all my demands perfectly,

347
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:04,126
so it annoys me to bits
to have a rookie tail us.

348
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,767
What a brat.

349
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,126
I knew you'd be kind and understand.

350
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:12,406
Then, since I'm hungry,

351
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,136
get me a roll of gimbap.

352
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:16,037
With cheese.

353
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:26,116
I delivered dumplings in high school...

354
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:27,586
and now I'm buying someone else's gimbap.

355
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:35,997
Hurry up, will you?

356
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,197
Sorry.

357
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,866
Are you kidding me? Don't
you know I hate cucumbers?

358
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,866
You should've had them taken out.

359
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:48,866
Sorry. I didn't know you disliked them.

360
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,737
Should I buy you another?

361
00:26:50,906 --> 00:26:52,747
Just get in and pick the cucumbers out.

362
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:53,947
I'm starving.

363
00:26:57,477 --> 00:26:58,547
What is it?

364
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:00,947
Pick out the cucumbers for me.

365
00:27:01,547 --> 00:27:02,717
Do it yourself.

366
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:06,727
Ju Kyung, I'm Chen.

367
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:09,757
Must I spend my time picking out cucumbers?

368
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:11,326
Do it yourself, darn it.

369
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:12,866
You have hands, don't you?

370
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:15,326
I didn't study makeup to
pick out your cucumbers.

371
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:16,767
How dare you abuse your power?

372
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,237
Are you out of your mind?

373
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,307
- Do you want to get fired?
- I'd rather quit...

374
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:22,676
than get fired by you,

375
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:24,507
you obnoxious brat!

376
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:27,007
What? How dare you!

377
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:28,547
Why? What's going on?

378
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,717
- It's her.
- Seriously?

379
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,447
Who do you think you are?

380
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,356
What did you do to her?

381
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:38,086
That's enough!

382
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:39,227
Chen, you too.

383
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:40,626
Stop playing the victim, darn it.

384
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,356
You must be out of your mind.

385
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:44,457
What did you just say?

386
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:45,557
Hey.

387
00:27:49,037 --> 00:27:51,267
Who are you laying hands on, you thug?

388
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:53,336
Kang Soo Jin?

389
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,277
Are you all right?

390
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,176
Are you hurt?

391
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:03,876
Have you been well?

392
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,346
I guess.

393
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:09,416
What about you? How have you been?

394
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:11,356
After dropping out of school,

395
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,626
Mom and I went to stay with my aunt overseas.

396
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:15,926
My parents got divorced, you see.

397
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:17,826
You must be attending college then.

398
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:21,497
No, I've been doing volunteer work overseas.

399
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,096
I only recently got back from Haiti.

400
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:25,767
I see.

401
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:28,666
No wonder.

402
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:33,376
No one had heard from you, so I got curious.

403
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:35,106
That's because I never told anyone.

404
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:38,247
Now that I'm back, I
wanted to apologize to you.

405
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:41,517
It's why I asked around to
figure out where you worked.

406
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:43,717
Ju Kyung,

407
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:45,856
I'm sorry.

408
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,826
I'm sorry it took me so long to apologize.

409
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:53,727
I'm really sorry.

410
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,797
This isn't so that you'd forgive me.

411
00:28:57,096 --> 00:28:58,166
Soo Jin...

412
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,237
I must've been a mess back then.

413
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,436
It seemed like you had what I couldn't have,

414
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:06,707
so I felt like I lost again.

415
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,846
Stealing what you had and
stomping on your relationship...

416
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:12,277
seemed like a way of winning.

417
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:15,916
I always had to be on top of everyone.

418
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:18,487
That's what I was taught.

419
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,697
Getting away from my father
finally let me see...

420
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:26,896
how deeply I hurt you back then...

421
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,737
and what I had lost.

422
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:34,136
I regretted my actions...

423
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:36,936
and tried to apologize to you,

424
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:40,876
but it didn't seem right
to say over the phone.

425
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,376
I also thought you'd ignore my calls too.

426
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:47,447
You should've called.

427
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:51,616
I would've loved to hear from you.

428
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,926
Maybe I should've.

429
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:04,336
I'm all right.

430
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:07,336
It doesn't faze me anymore.

431
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,707
Those memories...

432
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:14,007
don't hurt me as much anymore.

433
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,876
I guess that's why I don't even hate you.

434
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:23,356
Still, I'm glad that I was able to see you...

435
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:26,057
and apologize in person.

436
00:30:27,057 --> 00:30:28,826
I'm happier for you, you know.

437
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:30,856
You're free now.

438
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,426
Your hands have healed as well.

439
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,067
They're pretty.

440
00:30:40,936 --> 00:30:41,967
I know.

441
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:47,747
Your kick is still just as threatening.

442
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:49,477
I let my temper get the best of me.

443
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:52,116
I hope I didn't make things worse for you.

444
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,047
All they can do is fire
me anyway, so I'm good.

445
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:00,886
- That song?
- Of course.

446
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:02,426
It was my personal choice.

447
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:04,697
I've been a fan of Leo's
songs for a very long time.

448
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,027
You and Se Yeon made that song together.

449
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,866
And I think it'd be meaningful
to let Seo Jun sing it.

450
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:13,037
Don't you feel bad about leaving
it as a plagiarized song?

451
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:14,507
I'm sure you're upset about it too.

452
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,307
Why are you so serious?

453
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,277
I just can't believe it.

454
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:23,717
I've never studied music.

455
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:26,287
The only lessons I got were from Se Yeon.

456
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,047
Seo Jun already told me everything.

457
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,356
He told me it's easy to tell
how much you love music...

458
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,186
judging by the instruments
and equipment you own.

459
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:36,326
If we don't like your song,
we're not going to release it.

460
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:38,027
So don't get too ahead of yourself.

461
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:43,197
I want to hear Leo's
version of "Missing You".

462
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,336
Don't feel too pressured
and just send us the song.

463
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:47,267
Okay?

464
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,307
Okay then. That's enough about work.

465
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:52,676
Can I open my wedding gift?

466
00:31:53,406 --> 00:31:54,406
Sure.

467
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,416
Why is it so heavy?

468
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:09,727
You chose the best gift ever.

469
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:12,156
Congratulations on your wedding.

470
00:32:12,326 --> 00:32:14,967
I have so many things to fix at home.

471
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,606
I want to hear Leo's
version of "Missing You".

472
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:31,977
Passcode confirmed.

473
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:07,717
The purple sky

474
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:15,657
And the cool breeze makes me feel more lonely

475
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:22,867
All the familiar memories

476
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:29,036
Start coming back and
remind me of you tonight

477
00:33:32,606 --> 00:33:36,876
I have so much to thank you for

478
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,217
Our hearts used to flutter

479
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,817
As we smiled at one another

480
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,186
I fear

481
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:48,987
Who's the guy? What's his name?

482
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,097
Soo Jin already gave him
a good kick in the face.

483
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:54,896
I'm glad she did. If I were
there, I would've beaten him...

484
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:57,036
You wouldn't have beaten him to a pulp.

485
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:58,697
Fortunately, I didn't get fired.

486
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,907
But I am getting punished for it.

487
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:03,976
I need to finish this.
I'll call you back later.

488
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:11,577
What are you doing?

489
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:14,817
I'm washing the makeup brushes and sponges.

490
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:16,556
You're doing it all alone?

491
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:19,956
What are you doing?

492
00:34:20,387 --> 00:34:23,257
This is latex. If you wash it
with hot water, it shrinks.

493
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,996
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:30,137
You need to divide them into
natural and synthetic brushes first.

495
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:32,567
You need to wash them differently,
so don't get them mixed up.

496
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:34,036
Okay.

497
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:36,007
Was your name Lim Su Jeong?

498
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,177
No, I'm Lim Ju Kyung.

499
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,746
Were you the one who yelled at Chen earlier?

500
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,246
I'm really sorry about that as well.

501
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,047
I'm glad you did that.

502
00:34:45,646 --> 00:34:47,686
She looks down on our employees way too much.

503
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,916
I told her to get her
makeup done somewhere else.

504
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:51,987
Director.

505
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:54,086
About the makeup contest...

506
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:57,427
for Move Entertainment's new idol group...

507
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,097
Can I enter the contest as well?

508
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:01,697
Ms. Lim Kyung Ja, can't you read?

509
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:04,396
- Pardon?
- It says all the employees...

510
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:06,436
are allowed to enter. Didn't you see that?

511
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:09,976
Thank you! I'll do my best!

512
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,947
But my name is Lim Ju Kyung.

513
00:35:28,286 --> 00:35:30,396
Hey, look at him.

514
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:32,556
He's so handsome. Who is she?

515
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,126
- Do you think she's his girlfriend?
- She's probably just a friend.

516
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,266
Did I keep you waiting?

517
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:40,467
Honey, what took you so long?

518
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:41,766
I waited for you.

519
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:44,106
Honey, did you eat?

520
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:46,146
Here. Try a bite.

521
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:48,876
- Let's get back to this.
- She's his girlfriend.

522
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:56,786
Did you just get jealous?

523
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:59,827
Honey?

524
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,797
I didn't get jealous.

525
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:07,467
Don't go around with a smile
on your face from now on, okay?

526
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:11,097
I think those middle school
kids made you get jealous.

527
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,336
Honey.

528
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,106
Cut it out, Soo Ho.

529
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:18,836
Honey, why don't you try
calling me "Honey" again?

530
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,106
Forget it.

531
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,246
- Should I give it a try?
- Give what a try?

532
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,246
Are you going to call me "Honey"?

533
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:28,317
I haven't done a lot of makeup on guys,

534
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:29,447
so I'm not used to it.

535
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,686
- It tickles.
- Stay still.

536
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:35,927
Let me try this properly.

537
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:39,027
It doesn't always come
out the way I imagine it.

538
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,226
You're a terrible model.

539
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:45,266
- Soo Ho.
- Okay, fine.

540
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,737
Stay still.

541
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:50,277
Okay, nice! I love it! 1, 2.

542
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:52,806
Good. Look over here. 1, 2, 3. Okay. 1, 2.

543
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:55,777
I love how you guys are posing
right now. Give me a smile.

544
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:57,146
Look here and give me a smile.

545
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:02,246
1, 2, 3, 2, 3.

546
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:04,387
Okay, nice. Good.

547
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:07,027
You guys are so handsome!

548
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,427
Teenage girls are going
to go crazy over you guys.

549
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:12,427
Will you guys stop overreacting?

550
00:37:12,757 --> 00:37:15,597
It's because you're doing great.
Let's stir up the music industry.

551
00:37:15,597 --> 00:37:17,797
I love that frown on your
face. Seo Jun, that's great.

552
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:30,847

553
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,117

554
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:45,556
Let's just send it.

555
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,197
YOUR EMAIL HAS BEEN SENT.

556
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:04,976
Here you go.

NEW IDOL GROUP MAKEUP CONCEPT CONTEST

559
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:21,226
Were you okay? Didn't you get angry?

560
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,097
No, it was nice to see her again.

561
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,237
You're too nice.

562
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:31,836
But I'd like to meet Soo Jin too.

563
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:33,646
I've always wondered how she's doing.

564
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,547
This one's pretty. Try this on.

565
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,847
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

566
00:38:44,817 --> 00:38:46,356
This one's pretty too. Try this on as well.

567
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:52,996
How much did your sister give you
for a bag? How much can you spend?

568
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:55,996
She gave me a credit card.

569
00:38:55,996 --> 00:38:57,967
Then buy both. Just buy everything.

570
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,606
No, I can't. I also need to
buy clothes for the wedding.

571
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,336
- I'll take this one.
- Okay.

572
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:11,677
What should I wear for my
sister's wedding? This or this?

573
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,086
I like this one.

574
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,487
Never mind. I like this
one. No, I like this one.

575
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:21,887
- This one looks best.
- Why did you even ask?

576
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,396
By the way, you know how you went
on a trip with Soo Ho recently?

577
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:30,867
Yes. What about it?

578
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:32,766
Did anything happen?

579
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:35,206
- Like what?
- I mean...

580
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,806
You know what I'm talking about.
Did anything exciting happen?

581
00:39:39,007 --> 00:39:40,347
Anything exciting?

582
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,306
Oh, I almost lost my cell phone...

583
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:44,516
No, I'm not talking about that.

584
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,646
I'm asking if anything happened
between you and Soo Ho.

585
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,416
What... What are you talking about?

586
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:51,987
We got on an early train
and came back at night.

587
00:39:51,987 --> 00:39:54,626
What? Why are you guys a
pair of goody-two-shoes?

588
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,896
- You're not in high school...
- That's enough.

589
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:59,396
Don't be embarrassed.

590
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,967
Why aren't you meeting Soo
Ho today? It's your day off.

591
00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:03,436
He's meeting Tae Hoon today.

592
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:05,637
What? Tae Hoon? Why didn't
you tell me earlier?

593
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,067
- Let's go join them.
- Just let them have fun.

594
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:09,637
But I miss...

595
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:12,137
Well...

596
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,947
He owes me something,

597
00:40:14,947 --> 00:40:16,916
so try calling Soo Ho.

598
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:18,646
Okay.

599
00:40:18,646 --> 00:40:21,416
BOYFRIEND

600
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:28,286
- He isn't picking up.
- What?

601
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:30,356
- Try again.
- Okay.

602
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:38,097
He's not picking up. I
guess they're busy talking.

603
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:40,436
Why do I feel so suspicious?

604
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:42,836
Tae Hoon's partying every day
now that he's going to the army.

605
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:48,246
- We're going somewhere hot today!
- Unbelievable!

606
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:52,047
I can't believe this!
He's going somewhere hot?

607
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:53,987
What's the matter?

608
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:55,817
APGUJEONG GOMTOM

609
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:58,016
What the... Isn't this a hookup bar?

610
00:40:58,317 --> 00:40:59,387
What?

611
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:01,257
A hookup bar?

612
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:02,527
APGUJEONG GOMTOM

613
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:04,597
Tae Hoon, you're dead.

614
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:08,197
Did he pick up?

615
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:10,637
He won't pick up.

616
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:12,996
What?

617
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:15,266
Where are you? What are you doing?

618
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,137
I'm partying it up with Soo Ho. So what?

619
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:19,376
- Partying it up?
- What? Partying it up?

620
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,646
- Hey. You'd better...
- I'm busy. Bye.

621
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,447
Hey. Hello? Hey. Tae Hoon!

622
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,817
- What did he say?
- This piece of trash!

623
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:28,416
Did you call?

624
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,556
- Out of our way!
- Out of our way!

625
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,336
YOUR TAXI IS ON ITS WAY.

626
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,746
Tae Hoon! You're at this hookup
bar with Soo Ho, aren't you?

627
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:55,806
What are you talking about?

628
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:58,177
You posted a picture about
going somewhere really hot!

629
00:41:58,177 --> 00:42:00,016
- You're partying it up?
- Hey.

630
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,987
- Where's Soo Ho?
- Let go!

631
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,286
We went there.

632
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,027
- A hot sauna?
- That's right!

633
00:42:07,056 --> 00:42:08,086
What?

634
00:42:09,257 --> 00:42:10,456
It's Ju Kyung.

635
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,067
You partied it up...

636
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:15,967
Somewhere really hot.

637
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,597
It was hot. Super hot.

638
00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:21,836
It was very hot.

639
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,907
Hey. What's wrong with him?

640
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:27,507
Something's wrong. He feels like jello.

641
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:29,847
I gave him a few drinks in the sauna.

642
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,416
- What should we do?
- Soo Ho. Wake up.

643
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:34,447
Jju Kyung.

644
00:42:34,447 --> 00:42:36,286
- Jju Kyung? What the...
- Jju Kyung? What the...

645
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:38,257
You're wasted.

646
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,586
I'll take you home.

647
00:42:39,586 --> 00:42:40,987
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

648
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:42,586
- Okay.
- Get up.

649
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:45,956
Get home safely.

650
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:47,626
Bye.

651
00:42:47,626 --> 00:42:49,567
It's Jju Kyung. My Jju Kyung is here.

652
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,297
Yes. Taxi.

653
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:52,766
Taxi.

654
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,237
No, not there.

655
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,306
Let's go.

656
00:42:57,706 --> 00:42:58,777
Bye.

657
00:42:58,777 --> 00:42:59,836
Gosh.

658
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,416
I'll go too.

659
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:07,086
Wait! Doo Ah. I mean... Sorry.

660
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,746
Anyway, why are you here?

661
00:43:10,516 --> 00:43:11,617
What do you mean?

662
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:14,027
I mean, we broke up.

663
00:43:14,027 --> 00:43:16,356
Why do you care if I go somewhere hot...

664
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:18,527
or party it up?

665
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:22,896
I did not care!

666
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:25,697
You know you dumped me 17 times.

667
00:43:25,697 --> 00:43:29,007
You can beg all you want.
I won't take you back.

668
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,706
- Then why are you following me?
- It's late...

669
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:36,577
It's dangerous. I can't let you go alone.

670
00:43:37,476 --> 00:43:39,246
Whatever.

671
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:44,956
I love you.

672
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,786
Soo Ho.

673
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:52,927
Let's go.

674
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:54,726
Thank you.

675
00:43:58,367 --> 00:43:59,467
Come here.

676
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:03,806
Don't you dare drink like this again.

677
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,206
Ju Kyung.

678
00:44:10,864 --> 00:44:12,125
Where are we?

679
00:44:12,294 --> 00:44:15,435
This? This is your home.

680
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:17,305
- I'm dizzy.
- Careful.

681
00:44:17,504 --> 00:44:18,935
Okay. Careful.

682
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:25,145
Gosh. Okay.

683
00:44:33,245 --> 00:44:35,654
Wait. This...

684
00:44:36,855 --> 00:44:39,285
I was lucky enough to get
it, but you can have it.

685
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:43,565
You know my secret now, so
I should be nice to you.

686
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:47,265
So this is where you put it.

687
00:44:57,074 --> 00:45:00,674
Look at him smile while he's
drunk. This will not do.

688
00:45:00,844 --> 00:45:02,544
I said not to smile like that.

689
00:45:04,544 --> 00:45:05,785
Who are you?

690
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:09,484
- What?
- Who are you, that you came...

691
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:11,185
into my home?

692
00:45:12,324 --> 00:45:14,625
- I'm Lim Ju Kyung.
- Lim Ju Kyung?

693
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:18,265
My girlfriend's name is also Lim Ju Kyung.

694
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:23,134
You're pretty too.

695
00:45:23,835 --> 00:45:24,864
Am I?

696
00:45:25,364 --> 00:45:27,674
Then will you break up
with your girlfriend...

697
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:29,074
and go out with me?

698
00:45:29,734 --> 00:45:30,904
No.

699
00:45:31,404 --> 00:45:33,745
I belong to Lim Ju Kyung.

700
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:35,574
What a shame.

701
00:45:37,544 --> 00:45:39,815
Then I'll get going now.

702
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:42,085
Good night.

703
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,685
Wait.

704
00:45:46,555 --> 00:45:47,625
Come here.

705
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:58,864
I love you so much

706
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:00,875
Oh dear

707
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,805
Stop it. You're making me cringe.

708
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:06,444
I love you so much

709
00:46:06,745 --> 00:46:08,944
Oh dear

710
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:11,745
You're a completely different
person when you're drunk.

711
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:18,384
Ju Kyung.

712
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,294
You know...

713
00:46:23,424 --> 00:46:26,024
that song I wrote with Se Yeon?

714
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:29,935
Seo Jun is going to sing it.

715
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:32,665
Really?

716
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:37,944
Would Se Yeon...

717
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:40,774
like that too?

718
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:45,745
Of course. That's a given.

719
00:46:47,285 --> 00:46:48,285
Really?

720
00:46:49,555 --> 00:46:50,785
Yes, really.

721
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:54,995
I'd be super happy if it were me.

722
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,324
I really...

723
00:47:00,964 --> 00:47:02,435
hope you're right.

724
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:39,734
Ju Kyung.

725
00:47:42,035 --> 00:47:43,105
Wake up.

726
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:51,785
Ju Kyung.

727
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:54,285
It's late.

728
00:47:55,654 --> 00:47:56,685
Wake up.

729
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,694
I tried to wake you.

730
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:05,995
You're the one who didn't wake up.

731
00:48:11,134 --> 00:48:12,265
I love you.

732
00:48:35,024 --> 00:48:36,355
- Are you okay?
- What?

733
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:39,094
I meant to leave once you fell asleep,

734
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:40,364
but I fell asleep too.

735
00:48:40,364 --> 00:48:41,835
I was just about to wake you.

736
00:48:43,395 --> 00:48:44,565
3 MISSED CALLS FROM MOM

737
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:47,875
Mom called.

738
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,404
I didn't say I'd be late.

739
00:48:50,134 --> 00:48:51,904
Why didn't you go home?

740
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:54,875
I said you were sleeping over at my place.

741
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,544
Enjoy yourself, my friend.

742
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,315
Aren't you going to call her?

743
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:03,614
Well...

744
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,725
Soo Ah covered for me.

745
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:10,055
She did?

746
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:14,835
I'll drive you home. Where's my car key?

747
00:49:15,395 --> 00:49:17,234
Where did I put it?

748
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:18,464
But you drank.

749
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:20,435
Right.

750
00:49:21,274 --> 00:49:23,504
I should call a designated driver.

751
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:26,574
I'll just call a cab.

752
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:32,745
I can't get a car. Is
it because it's so late?

753
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:40,754
I'll hail one on the street.

754
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:47,694
Can't you stay?

755
00:49:50,565 --> 00:49:51,634
It's...

756
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:54,504
late.

757
00:49:59,574 --> 00:50:00,674
Don't go.

758
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,174
Are you cooking? I'm amazed.

759
00:51:07,674 --> 00:51:08,715
For this simple dish?

760
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,145
I'm just adding stuff and pan-frying them.

761
00:51:13,985 --> 00:51:15,755
I can barely cook a pot of ramyeon.

762
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:17,724
Then the cooking will be my job, I guess.

763
00:51:20,054 --> 00:51:21,494
It looks delicious. Here.

764
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:23,154
I'm starving.

765
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:25,194
Ta-da.

766
00:51:27,494 --> 00:51:28,795
You should slow down.

767
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:30,034
It's really good.

768
00:51:30,435 --> 00:51:32,105
Was it seasoned with magic?

769
00:51:32,165 --> 00:51:33,335
Try the salad too.

770
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:36,974
It's like I said. Fiber
is good for constipation.

771
00:51:52,185 --> 00:51:53,324
Just a second.

772
00:51:59,364 --> 00:52:00,435
Here.

773
00:52:03,804 --> 00:52:05,005
Because who I see...

774
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:08,574
is Lim Ju Kyung.

775
00:52:12,775 --> 00:52:14,244
You still had this?

776
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:16,674
Here.

777
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,614
Do you know how to tie hair back?

778
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:22,715
I'm willing to try.

779
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:28,395
Is this not right?

780
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:30,824
Why didn't you throw this out?

781
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,565
I'm glad I didn't.

782
00:52:33,795 --> 00:52:36,494
Why don't we watch a movie
after I get off work today?

783
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:40,534
Not today. I have something
important lined up.

784
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,674
Something important?

785
00:52:44,404 --> 00:52:51,114
When I close my eyes, the
image of you grows clearer

786
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:58,355
I end up missing your glowing face even more

787
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:04,324
Where you've been staying up this long night

788
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:12,304
I'll rest for a moment and stay by your side

789
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:19,275
On this exhausted night, tears let it blossom

790
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:26,545
When my song reaches the sky

791
00:53:26,715 --> 00:53:28,915
Gradually

792
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:30,585
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.

793
00:53:32,224 --> 00:53:33,384
You sounded amazing.

794
00:53:33,685 --> 00:53:37,424
What if you get arrested for
pounding on girls' hearts?

795
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:38,795
You and your cheesy comments.

796
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,165
Leo, what did you think?

797
00:53:41,634 --> 00:53:42,735
I almost barfed.

798
00:53:43,435 --> 00:53:45,304
Because it was that sick.

799
00:53:46,235 --> 00:53:47,875
- Do you have a death wish?
- Of course not.

800
00:53:48,674 --> 00:53:50,804
Pretty Boy 1 and 2, get arguing.

801
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:53,074
I wouldn't mind some blood, sweat, and tears.

802
00:53:53,074 --> 00:53:55,014
What? You're not going to vomit again, right?

803
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:56,844
Come on.

804
00:53:57,185 --> 00:54:00,485
Anyway, wrap up the recording.
I'm getting married tomorrow,

805
00:54:00,685 --> 00:54:02,455
- so I'll head home.
- Congratulations.

806
00:54:02,855 --> 00:54:04,554
You got lucky with your fiance.

807
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:07,855
I know. I should make my
Grapefruit a happy man.

808
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:09,755
- I'm off.
- Take care.

809
00:54:11,424 --> 00:54:12,724
Darn, I'm starving.

810
00:54:13,025 --> 00:54:14,235
Want to grab a bite?

811
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:16,835
Is this enough?

812
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:19,634
I can't sing on a full stomach.

813
00:54:19,904 --> 00:54:22,804
Your vocalization isn't
as good as it used to be.

814
00:54:22,974 --> 00:54:26,844
I saw you wiping tears away
while hearing me sing earlier.

815
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:27,915
When did I ever?

816
00:54:30,944 --> 00:54:33,815
Will I not get to see you
often once you make your debut?

817
00:54:33,915 --> 00:54:35,384
Of course, I'll be too busy.

818
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,324
You should get in line.

819
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:39,585
I'll be just as busy too.

820
00:54:40,554 --> 00:54:41,955
I'm thinking about studying.

821
00:54:42,855 --> 00:54:44,465
- Studying what?
- Music.

822
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:46,764
I never properly learned how to write songs.

823
00:54:47,395 --> 00:54:50,194
So I've decided to start with the basics.

824
00:54:50,194 --> 00:54:52,465
Wait. Will you be taking the CSAT then?

825
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:56,705
Poor Ju Kyung. She'll have
to provide for her boyfriend.

826
00:54:56,705 --> 00:54:58,904
I can take the test right now and
still get into a decent college.

827
00:54:58,904 --> 00:55:00,474
What a show-off.

828
00:55:01,114 --> 00:55:02,315
Anyway, I'm having some coke.

829
00:55:02,744 --> 00:55:05,685
Soda isn't good for your
throat, so stick to water.

830
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,855
Okay, fine. I'll drink water instead.

831
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:09,915
No wonder your singing
isn't as good as before.

832
00:55:10,855 --> 00:55:12,625
You're like a nagging wife.

833
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:15,094
A singer should take care of his voice.

834
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,764
LIM HEE KYUNG, HAN JOON
WOO WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

835
00:55:24,764 --> 00:55:26,034
BRIDE: LIM HEE KYUNG

836
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:27,375
GROOM: HAN JOON WOO

837
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,074
LIM HEE KYUNG, HAN JOON
WOO WE'RE GETTING MARRIED

838
00:55:33,545 --> 00:55:35,244
Who on earth is it?

839
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:37,384
Who have you been texting all day?

840
00:55:37,384 --> 00:55:39,315
- An older student from school.
- An older student?

841
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:41,154
Male or female?

842
00:55:41,514 --> 00:55:43,085
Male.

843
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:44,384
Male?

844
00:55:45,784 --> 00:55:47,494
Hey! Are you giggling?

845
00:55:48,224 --> 00:55:51,025
You should wait for me until
I get into college next year.

846
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:52,525
No one told you not to get into college.

847
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:55,395
- It's not like I didn't want to.
- Whatever.

848
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,465
Okay, fine. I'll let you flirt a little.

849
00:55:59,904 --> 00:56:03,005
Enjoy your college life to some extent, okay?

850
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:07,574
Hey, Ju Young.

851
00:56:08,545 --> 00:56:09,715
What?

852
00:56:10,045 --> 00:56:12,444
I'm aware of how much you like me...

853
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:15,014
and that I won't find
anyone as decent as you.

854
00:56:15,114 --> 00:56:19,125
So don't you dare flirt with
any girls at the academy.

855
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,755
You'll pay for it.

856
00:56:23,395 --> 00:56:25,364
Go Woon!

857
00:56:29,295 --> 00:56:31,565
Look at you, Ju Kyung. The
studying and the internship...

858
00:56:31,565 --> 00:56:33,505
truly paid off.

859
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:35,605
A bride shouldn't speak in that tone.

860
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,235
Stay still, will you?

861
00:56:38,105 --> 00:56:40,404
My Hee Kyung couldn't be more stunning.

862
00:56:41,974 --> 00:56:43,444
What's wrong with me?

863
00:56:44,145 --> 00:56:46,085
I honestly shouldn't cry.

864
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:48,585
Talk about the roles being reversed.

865
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:50,085
How adorable.

866
00:56:51,924 --> 00:56:54,795
- What's that, Dad?
- His eyes are puffy from the tears.

867
00:56:57,295 --> 00:56:59,665
They're less puffy now and...

868
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,634
Why do you keep on crying?

869
00:57:06,804 --> 00:57:10,005
You just had to marry a
man exactly like your dad.

870
00:57:11,205 --> 00:57:12,574
- All done.
- Really?

871
00:57:14,174 --> 00:57:15,744
Is this really me?

872
00:57:17,215 --> 00:57:19,085
- Hyun Sook.
- You're here!

873
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:21,614
- Hello.
- You look amazing. Congratulations.

874
00:57:21,614 --> 00:57:23,915
- Where's Seo Jun?
- I came with Go Woon.

875
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:26,424
Seo Jun's busy getting ready for his debut.

876
00:57:27,755 --> 00:57:28,955
You look stunning.

877
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:30,625
- Divine Hyun Kyu.
- Yes, Mighty Tae Hoon?

878
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:32,965
What gives? Why didn't
you bring your girlfriend?

879
00:57:34,395 --> 00:57:35,694
She's busy, you see.

880
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:37,904
You lied, didn't you?

881
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:39,134
You lied about having one...

882
00:57:39,134 --> 00:57:40,404
to get out of going to the military together.

883
00:57:40,404 --> 00:57:43,574
Where did you find this odd ring anyway?

884
00:57:43,574 --> 00:57:45,474
- Is it your dad's?
- My dad's?

885
00:57:45,474 --> 00:57:47,105
I got it in Dongdaemun...

886
00:57:47,105 --> 00:57:48,775
- and it's 18k gold.
- Whatever.

887
00:57:48,974 --> 00:57:50,014
As if you'll know.

888
00:57:50,014 --> 00:57:53,715
Hoon, you look incredible in that suit.

889
00:57:53,715 --> 00:57:55,514
Hold on. Why are you
calling him like that again?

890
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:57,855
You only used to when you dated.

891
00:57:58,185 --> 00:58:00,025
- Are you two back together?
- What?

892
00:58:00,255 --> 00:58:03,724
When did I call him Hoon? You
should get your ears checked.

893
00:58:03,724 --> 00:58:05,994
That's odd. You don't call
him Hoon for no reason.

894
00:58:06,025 --> 00:58:08,565
- What do you mean it's odd?
- Hey, it's been so long!

895
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:10,295
- Unbelievable.
- Hey, Hyun Kyu.

896
00:58:12,205 --> 00:58:13,735
It's so good to see you again.

897
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,915
Soo Ah, your hand is
bigger than I remember it.

898
00:58:23,915 --> 00:58:25,114
What do you think you're doing?

899
00:58:26,645 --> 00:58:28,614
How dare you take my girlfriend's hand!

900
00:58:28,614 --> 00:58:30,614
I didn't mean to... Wait, girlfriend?

901
00:58:30,614 --> 00:58:31,824
Stop it.

902
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:34,324
You've always been at each other's throats,

903
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:35,424
so when did this happen?

904
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:38,324
You said it would never
happen. I can't believe this.

905
00:58:38,324 --> 00:58:40,764
- I told you to be careful!
- No way.

906
00:58:41,194 --> 00:58:43,194
- Honey!
- Honey?

907
00:58:43,264 --> 00:58:45,605
Are you ashamed of me or something?

908
00:58:45,804 --> 00:58:47,605
- Whatever.
- No way.

909
00:58:48,674 --> 00:58:49,705
Guys.

910
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:53,574
Watch us become the sweetest couple.

911
00:58:54,005 --> 00:58:55,215
- No...
- Please don't.

912
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:57,585
Hey. Don't you dare!

913
00:58:57,585 --> 00:58:58,815
What do you think you're doing?

914
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:00,145
- I can't believe it.
- Unbelievable.

915
00:59:00,444 --> 00:59:01,485
Hoon, let's go.

916
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:04,355
- I can't watch this.
- Are you kidding me?

917
00:59:04,455 --> 00:59:05,884
Ju Kyung.

918
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,395
Hey, you're here.

919
00:59:08,694 --> 00:59:10,324
Are you done with her makeup?

920
00:59:10,654 --> 00:59:11,994
I don't know why I'm so nervous...

921
00:59:11,994 --> 00:59:13,724
when Hee Kyung's the one getting married.

922
00:59:13,994 --> 00:59:16,534
Are the contest results
out? Today's the day, right?

923
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:19,264
Yes, the results were posted.

924
00:59:19,335 --> 00:59:20,335
So how did it go?

925
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:21,835
Well...

926
00:59:22,474 --> 00:59:24,375
Good or bad?

927
00:59:26,705 --> 00:59:28,645
- So you made the cut.
- No, I didn't.

928
00:59:28,645 --> 00:59:31,185
- You didn't?
- The others are more experienced,

929
00:59:31,185 --> 00:59:32,485
so it only makes sense.

930
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,915
You must feel defeated. I
know how hard you tried.

931
00:59:35,485 --> 00:59:36,855
Still, I feel good about it.

932
00:59:37,215 --> 00:59:39,154
The internship will be over
once lectures begin again,

933
00:59:39,525 --> 00:59:42,094
so I wanted to do more than
just run errands all the time.

934
00:59:42,094 --> 00:59:43,924
I learned a lot while putting
the presentation together.

935
00:59:43,924 --> 00:59:45,224
I'm proud of you.

936
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:49,994
I was wrong to go with
the model I chose though.

937
00:59:50,364 --> 00:59:52,505
- Why?
- People asked me more about you...

938
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,335
after seeing your photo.

939
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:55,705
They asked me where I found you.

940
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:58,775
So it's because of you that I didn't pass.

941
00:59:59,545 --> 01:00:01,114
- Is it?
- Yes.

942
01:00:01,674 --> 01:00:04,284
- What can I do to make up for it?
- I'm not sure.

943
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:07,585
Soo Ho, my best friend.

944
01:00:08,384 --> 01:00:10,215
You guys are so pretty and handsome today.

945
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:12,824
- It's like you're getting married.
- Exactly.

946
01:00:16,194 --> 01:00:17,255
Soo Jin.

947
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:19,364
My gosh, is that Kang Soo Jin?

948
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:24,605
You haven't changed one bit.

949
01:00:25,435 --> 01:00:27,134
Long time no see, Kang Soo.

950
01:00:28,474 --> 01:00:30,034
I haven't heard anyone call
me that in a long time.

951
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:34,045
I'm glad you came. Soo Ah
wanted to meet you too.

952
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:37,145
Have you been well?

953
01:00:37,415 --> 01:00:38,985
I heard about your dad.

954
01:00:39,514 --> 01:00:41,215
- I'm relieved.
- Me too.

955
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:43,154
Thanks.

956
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:47,654
I missed you.

957
01:00:48,694 --> 01:00:50,194
You should've called.

958
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:53,264
I'm sorry.

959
01:00:54,935 --> 01:00:56,034
How cute.

960
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,605
Hee Kyung, your ring is here.

961
01:00:58,605 --> 01:01:00,974
Thank goodness it got here on time.

962
01:01:00,974 --> 01:01:02,474
- Try it on to see if it fits.
- Okay.

963
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:07,404
- It's a bit tight.
- What?

964
01:01:07,815 --> 01:01:09,174
- It won't come off.
- What?

965
01:01:09,275 --> 01:01:11,014
It's because you drank yesterday.

966
01:01:11,014 --> 01:01:12,614
What kind of bride drinks
before her own wedding?

967
01:01:12,614 --> 01:01:14,284
It really won't come off. Take it off for me.

968
01:01:14,284 --> 01:01:15,384
- My goodness.
- Let me see.

969
01:01:16,085 --> 01:01:17,784
Gosh, it really won't come off.

970
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,455
Why don't I just wear it?

971
01:01:20,455 --> 01:01:21,525
You can't do that.

972
01:01:21,755 --> 01:01:24,255
Exchanging rings is the most
important part of the wedding.

973
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:27,125
- He's right. Here. Let me try.
- You want to try?

974
01:01:27,994 --> 01:01:29,465
I'll get it off for you.

975
01:01:31,705 --> 01:01:33,505
I think my finger might come off.

976
01:01:33,505 --> 01:01:35,205
- Honey, be gentle.
- Gosh, it hurts.

977
01:01:35,304 --> 01:01:37,804
- Be gentle.
- I'll get it off for you!

978
01:01:38,605 --> 01:01:40,974
- My gosh, it hurts!
- My goodness.

979
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:44,685
You got it off!

980
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,485
There it is.

981
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:57,965
It's time for the bride
to go to the waiting room.

982
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,065
I got you.

983
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,165
What's going on?

984
01:02:06,665 --> 01:02:07,705
- What's wrong?
- What is it?

985
01:02:07,705 --> 01:02:08,904
Darn it.

986
01:02:11,505 --> 01:02:12,744
Hee Kyung, congratulations...

987
01:02:15,915 --> 01:02:16,974
What's going on?

988
01:02:16,974 --> 01:02:19,315
- Isn't it the bride's waiting room?
- What's the groom doing there?

989
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:20,685
Hello.

990
01:02:20,685 --> 01:02:22,654
My gosh, what's all this?

991
01:02:23,255 --> 01:02:24,985
I didn't know grooms also
had waiting rooms these days.

992
01:02:24,985 --> 01:02:27,654
Bravo. Mr. Han, you look amazing.

993
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:28,994
Congratulations.

994
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:31,625
- Thank you.
- I'll take a photo of everyone.

995
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,795
- Stand next to the groom.
- Okay, let's go.

996
01:02:33,895 --> 01:02:35,065
Be careful.

997
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:36,835
You can sit here.

998
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:39,235
I'll take a photo now.

999
01:02:39,804 --> 01:02:41,875
1, 2, 3.

1000
01:02:43,835 --> 01:02:44,974
What's wrong?

1001
01:02:45,744 --> 01:02:47,045
- My goodness.
- Are you okay?

1002
01:02:49,074 --> 01:02:50,574
- My goodness!
- Please let go.

1003
01:02:50,574 --> 01:02:52,244
It's time for the groom to get
ready to walk down the aisle.

1004
01:02:52,244 --> 01:02:53,415
Okay.

1005
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:57,685
Please! I'm the groom!

1006
01:02:59,855 --> 01:03:02,224
- Come on!
- This isn't working!

1007
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:03,694
Has her face gotten bigger?

1008
01:03:03,795 --> 01:03:06,094
What are we going to do?
Should we call someone?

1009
01:03:06,395 --> 01:03:07,625
Should we call 911?

1010
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:10,594
- 911?
- But she needs to go right now.

1011
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:11,665
What?

1012
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:13,505
It's finally time to see...

1013
01:03:13,705 --> 01:03:16,304
the bride and groom walk down the aisle.

1014
01:03:16,304 --> 01:03:19,645
I'd like everyone to face the back.

1015
01:03:19,804 --> 01:03:23,545
Okay then. Let's give them
a round of applause...

1016
01:03:23,545 --> 01:03:25,045
and welcome them...

1017
01:03:25,045 --> 01:03:28,215
with excitement as we keep
our voices up on note C7.

1018
01:03:28,215 --> 01:03:30,554
Let's welcome the bride and groom.

1019
01:03:40,264 --> 01:03:43,764
This is the most beautiful
wedding I've ever seen.

1020
01:03:45,505 --> 01:03:46,605
Let's give them a round of applause!

1021
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:54,545
I love your voices.

1022
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:04,054
Now that the wedding has come to an end,

1023
01:04:04,054 --> 01:04:07,424
it's time for the officiant to
give them his words of blessings.

1024
01:04:07,424 --> 01:04:10,154
The fact that I was given the opportunity...

1025
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:13,625
to officiate Han Joon Woo...

1026
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:16,565
and Lim Hee Kyung's wedding...

1027
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:20,335
makes me feel unbelievably
grateful and honored.

1028
01:04:20,335 --> 01:04:23,034
Let me tell you something
about the groom, Han Joon Woo.

1029
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:26,974
The moment he set foot
into Saebom High School,

1030
01:04:26,974 --> 01:04:28,474
I saw a halo,

1031
01:04:28,474 --> 01:04:32,215
and I could instantly tell
that he had the competence...

1032
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:35,154
to lead our school to create...

1033
01:04:35,154 --> 01:04:37,014
a new history!

1034
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:39,455
Now let's see how much the
bride loves the groom...

1035
01:04:39,455 --> 01:04:42,154
by hearing her shout her
love for him three times.

1036
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:45,694
Han Joon is my man! Han Joon is my man!

1037
01:04:45,694 --> 01:04:49,235
- Han Joon is my man! I love you!
- Congratulations!

1038
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,375
- Kiss! Kiss!
- Kiss! Kiss!

1039
01:04:58,705 --> 01:05:00,074
- Kiss! Kiss!
- No...

1040
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:03,275
Let's congratulate them
with a round of applause!

1041
01:05:58,264 --> 01:05:59,534
Amazing!

1042
01:08:13,305 --> 01:08:14,665
I'll go wash the sponges.

1043
01:08:18,774 --> 01:08:19,875
Seo Jun.

1044
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:22,375
Hey, you're here too?

1045
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:24,675
You look great today.

1046
01:08:25,284 --> 01:08:26,545
It's not just today.

1047
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:28,654
I look great every day.

1048
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:31,684
Seo Jun, are you done?

1049
01:08:32,284 --> 01:08:34,055
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

1050
01:08:50,774 --> 01:08:52,274
I see you're on your toes today.

1051
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,095
Which color do you think we should use?

1052
01:09:14,425 --> 01:09:16,595
Pardon? Me?

1053
01:09:16,795 --> 01:09:18,434
Who else would I be talking to?

1054
01:09:20,234 --> 01:09:21,305
Well...

1055
01:09:23,104 --> 01:09:26,845
In order to match the color
of his hair and outfit,

1056
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:32,114
I think we should use one
that's a bit more matte.

1057
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:34,444
Why don't you give it a try?

1058
01:09:35,385 --> 01:09:38,255
- Me?
- Who else would I be talking to?

1059
01:09:38,684 --> 01:09:41,455
Here. I heard you guys are friends.

1060
01:09:41,955 --> 01:09:43,095
Give it a nice finishing touch.

1061
01:09:51,265 --> 01:09:52,305
About the concept proposal...

1062
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:55,705
You did pretty well for an intern,

1063
01:09:56,774 --> 01:09:57,904
Ju Kyung.

1064
01:10:02,314 --> 01:10:03,774
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

1065
01:10:04,215 --> 01:10:06,684
She just said my name and
complimented me, right?

1066
01:10:06,684 --> 01:10:07,784
I'm not dreaming, am I?

1067
01:10:08,515 --> 01:10:09,684
Look at this girl.

1068
01:10:10,385 --> 01:10:13,085
You don't know how it feels
for a geek who succeeded.

1069
01:10:15,654 --> 01:10:16,994
Finish it already.

1070
01:10:18,055 --> 01:10:19,225
Okay.

1071
01:10:27,104 --> 01:10:28,274
Do you have tremors?

1072
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:31,904
It's my first time doing
this at a real event.

1073
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,644
You did it well last time.

1074
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:36,375
It's different.

1075
01:10:36,475 --> 01:10:38,944
You can't mess it up even if you mess up.

1076
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:41,184
My lips are too sexy for that.

1077
01:10:43,715 --> 01:10:44,984
Stay still.

1078
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:02,734
All done.

1079
01:11:04,944 --> 01:11:06,104
Thanks.

1080
01:11:06,604 --> 01:11:09,515
I didn't do anything. Perform
well. I'll be watching.

1081
01:11:09,675 --> 01:11:10,774
Don't be nervous.

1082
01:11:11,944 --> 01:11:13,144
You too. Good luck.

1083
01:11:14,215 --> 01:11:15,284
Good luck.

1084
01:11:16,154 --> 01:11:17,715
Your hand is sweaty.

1085
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,955
You're nervous, aren't you?

1086
01:11:20,225 --> 01:11:22,755
I am not. I've got nerves of steel.

1087
01:11:22,894 --> 01:11:24,324
I don't get nervous.

1088
01:11:34,135 --> 01:11:35,475
Let's go!

1089
01:11:40,104 --> 01:11:41,915
- Let's do this.
- Hands in.

1090
01:11:43,074 --> 01:11:45,385
We've worked hard, so let's do our best.

1091
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:47,184
- Let's do a cheer.
- Okay. 1, 2, 3.

1092
01:11:47,184 --> 01:11:48,215
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1093
01:11:51,784 --> 01:11:52,784
Hey.

1094
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:56,154
- Did you finish?
- Yes. I did Seo Jun's lips.

1095
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:58,154
What about me?

1096
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,125
It's starting.

1097
01:12:26,225 --> 01:12:31,055
The purple sky

1098
01:12:32,564 --> 01:12:38,095
And the cool breeze makes me feel more lonely

1099
01:12:39,465 --> 01:12:44,835
All the familiar memories

1100
01:12:45,175 --> 01:12:51,074
Start coming back and
remind me of you tonight

1101
01:12:54,484 --> 01:12:59,425
I have so much to thank you for

1102
01:13:00,854 --> 01:13:06,394
Our hearts used to flutter
as we smiled at one another

1103
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:13,104
I fear you'll turn into a
star and disappear again

1104
01:13:13,364 --> 01:13:19,604
I'll cherish you in the void in my heart

1105
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:27,784
When I close my eyes, the
image of you grows clearer

1106
01:13:28,415 --> 01:13:34,854
I end up missing your glowing face even more

1107
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:40,894
Where you've been staying up this long night

1108
01:13:42,135 --> 01:13:48,705
I'll rest for a moment and stay by your side

1109
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:55,944
On this exhausted night, tears let it blossom

1110
01:13:56,744 --> 01:14:03,154
When my song reaches the sky

1111
01:14:03,255 --> 01:14:10,625
Gradually Come to me like an eternal dream

1112
01:14:10,824 --> 01:14:16,394
Become a star and stay by my side

1113
01:14:32,284 --> 01:14:34,284
You rock!

1114
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:40,484
As if I roamed in the darkness for years

1115
01:14:41,484 --> 01:14:45,225
And finally found light

1116
01:14:45,295 --> 01:14:48,595
All the hardships that weighed me down

1117
01:14:49,064 --> 01:14:54,005
Melt away like snow

1118
01:14:54,034 --> 01:14:58,875
My dream of hope gave
me the strength to fight

1119
01:14:59,005 --> 01:15:03,175
- The countless tears
- The countless tears

1120
01:15:04,074 --> 01:15:08,854
Relying on my hopeless dream

1121
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:13,725
I gave my heart and jumped in

1122
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:17,894
It starts today

1123
01:15:17,894 --> 01:15:24,034
A new world slowly appears before my eyes

1124
01:15:24,364 --> 01:15:30,705
And in it, I'll run afresh

1125
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:36,274
My future that I feared

1126
01:15:36,274 --> 01:15:37,574
You're awesome!

1127
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,184
One by one

1128
01:15:40,684 --> 01:15:43,255
They're coming true

1129
01:15:43,484 --> 01:15:49,324
The dreams that I had
wished for so desperately

1130
01:15:49,354 --> 01:15:52,494
They come to me

1131
01:15:52,864 --> 01:15:55,765
Within reach

1132
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,074
I didn't finish yet.

1133
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,345
- Did you finish?
- Not yet.

1134
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:14,144
You're so slow.

1135
01:16:14,644 --> 01:16:16,385
You said you were a master of speed-reading.

1136
01:16:16,784 --> 01:16:19,284
I'm focusing carefully on each page.

1137
01:16:20,255 --> 01:16:22,694
Do you just look at the pictures?

1138
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:24,625
That's disrespectful.

1139
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:26,194
I really am a master of speed-reading.

1140
01:16:27,194 --> 01:16:28,734
You're so arrogant.

1141
01:16:30,095 --> 01:16:32,104
They wrote this really well.

1142
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:35,034
They revised "Killer of
Darkness" into a zombie story.

1143
01:16:35,234 --> 01:16:36,705
They did a great job.

1144
01:16:37,034 --> 01:16:39,574
Really? I wondered why they
felt the need to change it.

1145
01:16:39,744 --> 01:16:43,045
I feel like it lost the charm
of the original that created...

1146
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:46,284
an eerie fear of the unknown
beings by making them zombies.

1147
01:16:47,045 --> 01:16:50,215
True. The original is good in many ways too.

1148
01:16:50,415 --> 01:16:52,824
You know the book from 1921 by Ed Seller...

1149
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:53,925
- "Dead of Night."
- "Dead of Night."

1150
01:16:54,425 --> 01:16:56,225
- So you do know.
- How could I not?

1151
01:16:56,455 --> 01:16:58,095
The writing style is still not outdated...

1152
01:16:58,095 --> 01:17:00,225
Okay, okay. Let's finish
reading. I want to see the rest.

1153
01:17:00,494 --> 01:17:01,625
Flip the page.

1154
01:17:03,595 --> 01:17:05,534
I'm done. Flip the page.

1155
01:17:07,904 --> 01:17:09,305
Seriously.

1156
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:13,475
What are you two doing?

1157
01:17:15,744 --> 01:17:17,975
Nothing. Gosh, this thing.

1158
01:17:21,644 --> 01:17:25,184
Sorry. Continue what you were
doing. I'm going to go eat.

1159
01:17:25,984 --> 01:17:27,354
I'm going to eat a multi-course meal.

1160
01:17:32,524 --> 01:17:33,524
Shall we continue?

1161
01:17:34,765 --> 01:17:37,364
Silly. Forget it.

1162
01:17:42,305 --> 01:17:43,375
Found it.

1163
01:18:56,002 --> 01:18:58,250
THANK YOU GO WOO RI AND DAYOUNG
FOR THE SPECIAL APPEARANCE.

1164
01:18:59,016 --> 01:19:01,404
THANK YOU ACTORS AND STAFF FOR
FOLLOWING RULES TO STOP THE SPREAD.

1165
01:19:02,074 --> 01:19:06,002
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING
AND WATCHING "TRUE BEAUTY".

1166
01:19:29,005 --> 01:19:31,675
