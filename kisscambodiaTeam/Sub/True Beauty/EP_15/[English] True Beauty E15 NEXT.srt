EPISODE 15

2
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:47,118
I'm here.

3
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,158
Dad.

4
00:00:58,728 --> 00:00:59,728
What?

5
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:05,169
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:09,708
I'm sorry, Soo Ho.

7
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:13,839
I thought I'd never get the chance...

8
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,179
to tell you that.

9
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:21,848
It's all right.

10
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,358
Dad, you should eat.

11
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:02,158
Here.

12
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,068
I promised...

13
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,839
to buy you something delicious.

14
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,209
You can once you've fully recovered.

15
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:27,918
Buy me something delicious.

16
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,659
ALARM: 3AM

17
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:41,958
BOARDING PASS

00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,629
GIRLFRIEND

19
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,369
Weren't you asleep? It's
after midnight there.

20
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,438
I was studying, of course.
It'll soon be our senior year.

21
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,638
- Are you at the airport?
- Not yet.

22
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,249
I'll go once I see my father get
discharged from the hospital.

23
00:02:58,448 --> 00:02:59,978
Will he be returning to Korea too?

24
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,878
No, I'll be returning first.

25
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,619
He shouldn't travel long distances yet,

26
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,188
so he decided to take it easy for a while.

27
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,388
I see.

28
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,829
Anyway, it's been a month
since we saw each other.

29
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:14,728
You're right.

30
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:17,468
I missed you.

31
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,598
- I'll meet you at the airport.
- Don't.

32
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:23,968
I'll head to you as soon as my plane lands.

33
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,878
I'll see you tomorrow...
No, I'll see you later.

34
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,079
Sure.

35
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,639
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

36
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,139
OPERATION ROOM

37
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,239
Dad?

38
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,309
Dad!

39
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:04,478
Dad!

40
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,318
There was secondary bleeding in his brain,

41
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,348
so I had to perform emergency surgery.

42
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,888
The location of the bleeding isn't
as ideal as it was last time,

43
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:14,559
but we're doing our best.

44
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,249
OPERATING ROOM

45
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:39,679
Your father had a cardiac
arrest during the operation.

46
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:42,078
Fortunately, his life was never at risk.

47
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:45,648
His vitals are stable, but his
condition is still serious.

48
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,388
ARRIVALS

49
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,249
- The divine Tae Hoon.
- The mighty Hyun Kyu.

50
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:46,008
- Here's to another good year.
- Likewise.

51
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,679
You're better looking...

52
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,588
Ju Kyung, are you in this class too?

53
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:52,318
- Talk about a deja vu.
- I know.

54
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,258
Here's to another good year together.

55
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:56,429
- 1, 2, 3, go.
- Go!

56
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:58,828
- I'm Yoo Tae Hoon.
- And I'm Ahn Hyun Kyu.

57
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,458
Jjoo!

58
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:05,669
- You're here.
- Hey.

59
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,638
I heard that Soo Jin dropped
out of school during the break.

60
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:14,109
What? For real?

61
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,809
Rumor has it that she went to study abroad.

62
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,578
Are you all right though?

63
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:23,249
Did Soo Ho tell you when he'd be back?

64
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:26,258
No, not yet.

65
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,958
Why am I shivering?

66
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:49,338
How is he?

67
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,878
He's still unwell.

68
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,549
Did you get some sleep?

69
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,859
Ju Kyung, aren't you going to school?

70
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,328
- My stomach.
- Ju Kyung!

71
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:38,688
What's wrong?

72
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:41,898
My goodness, what's the
matter? Where does it hurt?

73
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,299
- My stomach.
- Your stomach?

74
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:45,299
My goodness gracious.

75
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,938
Oh, dear. My goodness.

76
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,268
Does it hurt a lot?

77
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,349
GIRLFRIEND

78
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,489
BOYFRIEND

79
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:16,568
Hey, Soo Ho.

80
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,068
Hello, ma'am.

81
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:20,369
Hello. Have you been well?

82
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:21,739
Yes, I guess.

83
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:24,609
But why didn't Ju Kyung pick up?

84
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,838
She's sick, so she's at
the hospital right now.

85
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,809
She's sick? What's wrong with her?

86
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,778
Don't get startled. It's
nothing to worry about.

87
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,078
She had an upset stomach.

88
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,278
She's a senior now, so
she's been busy studying.

89
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:35,678
I think that caused her
to get a little stressed.

90
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,319
Can she talk on the phone right now?

91
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,119
I'm sorry. She's asleep.

92
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,128
By the way, how's your father?

93
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:48,028
He's still not doing very well.

94
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:52,298
You must be having a hard time as well.

95
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:55,199
I'll tell Ju Kyung to call
as soon as she wakes up.

96
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,439
Okay.

97
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,398
Hey, Soo Ho.

98
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:28,569
I feel like we haven't talked in ages.

99
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,268
I know, right? Is everything okay?

100
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,079
Yes, everything's okay.

101
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:34,709
Actually, I have something to tell you.

102
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:37,878
I finally got my license.

103
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,249
Good job.

104
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:42,678
I know, right?

105
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,288
- Ju Kyung.
- Yes?

106
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:49,859
I think we should...

107
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,128
break up.

108
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,859
What?

109
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:58,898
I don't know when my dad's going to wake up.

110
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,839
And I'm sure it's hard for you
to wait for me until I return.

111
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,209
What are you talking about?

112
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,018
I'm totally fine.

113
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,918
I can wait. I'm fine.

114
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:20,418
I just feel so bad.

115
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,058
I'm can't be there for you.

116
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,898
And that makes me feel so sorry.

117
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,499
So...

118
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,239
Who says you need to feel sorry?

119
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:35,999
I told you I'm fine. Why
are you overreacting?

120
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,138
I don't want to break up.

121
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:47,778
You can even stay there forever.
I'll save up and visit you instead.

122
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,048
I can't let you do that.

123
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:54,119
Why not?

124
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:01,158
Don't skip school.

125
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:04,398
Don't wait for me to call you anymore.

126
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,339
And sleep well.

127
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,109
Don't say that. Please don't.

128
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,778
Don't talk as if this is going
to be our last phone call.

129
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:18,949
I'm going to pretend like
I didn't hear anything.

130
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,648
I never picked up, okay?

131
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:27,349
PRINCE COMICS

132
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:31,888
PRINCE COMICS

133
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,558
Mr. Prince.

134
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,518
Hey, Ju Bal.

135
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,758
Why are you throwing the chair out?

136
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,359
They're too old, so I'm going to change them.

137
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:43,099
Come inside.

138
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:36,648
Ta-da! I bought these
with the money I earned.

139
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,089
They're a matching set.

140
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:43,628
Cute, right?

141
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,749
I'm not a crybaby. I'm Lee Soo Ho.

142
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:15,158
When will you finally remember me?

143
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:21,359
On the first day of snow,
I'm going to go to Namsan...

144
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:24,229
and make a wish hoping
that you'll remember me.

145
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:27,069
What?

146
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:32,609
You should've told me.

147
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,508
How was I supposed to know
when you didn't tell me?

148
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:08,239
You know how they say your wish
comes true on the first day of snow?

149
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,008
That means everyone who sees
the first snow should be happy.

150
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:14,418
But why are there so many
unhappy people in this world?

151
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,619
My dad still doesn't have a job.

152
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:18,219
I can't believe you believe that.

153
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,788
I'm sure they say that for a reason.

154
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,758
I thought about it long and hard.

155
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,089
I think the only person
whose wish comes true...

156
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,398
is the very first person that the snow hits.

157
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:29,699
That's nonsense.

158
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,298
So when it snows for the
very first time this year,

159
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,699
I'm going to go to the highest place...

160
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,569
and be the first one to touch the snow.

161
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:37,969
The highest place? Where?

162
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,479
- Are you going to get on a plane...
- I'm going to go to Namsan.

163
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,839
What?

164
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,979
Isn't that the highest place in Seoul?

165
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,749
Let's say you're right.

166
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:46,849
You just wait and see.

167
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:49,518
If my wish comes true,
you'll find out I was right.

168
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:03,199
I'M NOT A CRYBABY. I'M LEE SOO HO.

169
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,699
WHEN WILL YOU FINALLY REMEMBER ME?

170
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,999
ON THE FIRST DAY OF SNOW,
I'M GOING TO GO TO NAMSAN...

171
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,898
AND MAKE A WISH HOPING
THAT YOU'LL REMEMBER ME.

172
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:15,278
I can't believe he
remembered everything I said.

173
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:20,219
ON THE FIRST DAY OF SNOW,
I'M GOING TO GO TO NAMSAN...

174
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:23,849
AND MAKE A WISH HOPING
THAT YOU'LL REMEMBER ME.

175
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,518
Why does he have to be so smart?

176
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:43,168
COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC ABILITY TEST

177
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:26,278
I took the CSAT today.

178
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:30,719
If I do well in the practical section,

179
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,419
I may be able to go to the college I want.

180
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:37,288
So this is how it feels
to get closer to my dream.

181
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,298
I'm excited and happy.

182
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:46,229
Did you start studying music there?

183
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,969
Someday,

184
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,439
somewhere,

185
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:55,379
it'll be nice to hear music that you create.

186
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:03,379
I kept texting you to whine
about how hard things were,

187
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:08,189
but now that the CSAT is
over, I've lost that excuse.

188
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:13,999
Soo Ho. It's snowing here.

189
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:19,169
I hope it's warm...

190
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,038
and not cold where you are.

191
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:32,209
I won't contact you anymore.

192
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:37,389
Goodbye.

193
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:46,064
Okay. Smile, Chen.

194
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:47,633
You're so pretty.

195
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,873
- Nice.
- Look at her.

196
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:50,544
Fix your hair a little.

197
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,173
You look so pretty.

198
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:53,444
Nice.

199
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:56,244
Please touch up her hair and makeup.

200
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:02,984
Here.

201
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,083
- Mouthwash.
- Okay.

202
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:15,564
Mist.

203
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:19,534
- I'll spray it.
- Okay.

204
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,173
Hey, Ju Kyung. When will you...

205
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:28,843
introduce me to Seo Jun?

206
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:35,254
He's a trainee, so he's too busy...

207
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:36,583
to meet anyone.

208
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,254
Don't you see him more often at the agency?

209
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:42,054
There are just so many
times I can hit on him.

210
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:44,194
It hurts my pride too much.

211
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:48,494
I hear you're close friends.
Let me meet with him alone.

212
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:52,804
- Ask him now while we're at it.
- Now?

213
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:54,833
- Now?
- Yes. Please? Please.

214
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,633
I'm begging you. Please?

215
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,173
Hold on. Just a minute.

216
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:04,214
She begs every time I see her.

217
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:06,643
Meet with her just once. Please?
I'll treat you to a barbecue.

218
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,314
No, no. It's too annoying.

219
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:10,954
All you have to do is eat one meal with her.

220
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:12,984
Ju Kyung.

221
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,593
What did Seo Jun say?

222
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:19,923
Well... He must be busy. He isn't responding.

223
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,704
No. I detest her type.

224
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:32,204
- Oh no.
- What's wrong?

225
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:33,944
- Oh no!
- This is a designer dress.

226
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,673
- This was borrowed.
- Oh no.

227
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:37,343
- You should've been careful.
- No, I...

228
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:38,984
I know.

229
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:42,014
I told you to make sure not
to get anything on the dress!

230
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:44,524
Seriously. What do we do?

231
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:46,823
I'm sorry. Sorry.

232
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,994
You can't pay for this even
if you work for a year.

233
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:51,524
What will you do?

234
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:55,093
- It won't come out.
- Oh no.

235
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:59,734
Ju Kyung. Talk to Seo Jun for me,

236
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:01,204
okay?

237
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,873
It's okay. It's okay, guys.

238
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:07,714
I'll talk to my agency about
it. Just let me change.

239
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:09,643
- It feels icky.
- Thank you.

240
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,083
- What an angel.
- Let's go.

241
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:12,683
Don't scold her too much.

242
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:15,054
It's so icky.

243
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:16,883
Icky.

244
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:23,353
Cheers!

245
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:24,764
Cheers!

246
00:21:24,764 --> 00:21:26,524
- Saebom High!
- Yes!

247
00:21:27,564 --> 00:21:30,034
Why doesn't she just seduce
him if she likes him?

248
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:33,534
Why is she bugging me so much?

249
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:36,534
You said she's a witch, so a
staff member quits every month.

250
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:39,603
If Seo Jun would just go
on one date with Chen,

251
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:40,913
it would make your work life easier.

252
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,373
Why can't he do that for you?

253
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:45,413
I can't force him against
his will. That's wrong.

254
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:48,054
But it's so hard for me.

255
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:52,123
Hey. Why did you call us out today?

256
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:54,494
I'm supposed to watch a
movie with my Mini Me.

257
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:57,064
Isn't that right, wifey?

258
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:59,393
"Isn't that right, wifey?"

259
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:01,064
Yes, hubby.

260
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:02,694
Must you do that in front
of your single friends?

261
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:05,464
What's wrong? Did the girl you
were seeing dump you again?

262
00:22:05,464 --> 00:22:06,764
I was not!

263
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,774
What? Are you happy that I'm single?

264
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:10,704
Are you not over me after dumping me?

265
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:13,343
Whatever. Dream on.

266
00:22:15,774 --> 00:22:19,244
Listen! The reason I called
all of you here today...

267
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:20,883
is to make a big announcement.

268
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:24,984
- What is it?
- What the...

269
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:27,754
- So...
- What is that?

270
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:31,264
Hyun Kyu and I are going
to the army next month.

271
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:32,863
- What?
- What?

272
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:34,833
- Where?
- When?

273
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,504
We're going to enter together
side by side. So please...

274
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:39,603
support us.

275
00:22:39,764 --> 00:22:41,433
- Salute!
- Salute!

276
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,504
Salute!

277
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:45,444
I'm sorry.

278
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:47,044
I didn't enlist.

279
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:49,913
I got a girlfriend.

280
00:22:49,913 --> 00:22:51,244
- No way!
- Oh my gosh.

281
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:55,454
A girl has taken ownership
of my heart recently.

282
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:57,923
Regardless, I can't join the army.

283
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:00,454
I'm stunned. Of all the... I'm stunned.

284
00:23:00,454 --> 00:23:03,494
You traitor! We agreed to join together!

285
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:06,264
- Hey!
- Hey.

286
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:09,534
How can I leave my girlfriend
as soon as I finally get one?

287
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:12,304
Give me a break. I knew it when
I saw you didn't cut your hair.

288
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,903
- Get over here! Get me scissors!
- Hey!

289
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:16,204
Stop it, Tae Hoon!

290
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:18,704
Hey, hey, hey. Stop it.

291
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:22,113
Seriously. Look how much you
fight. Why would you go together?

292
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:23,984
Let's drink. Cheers.

293
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:27,014
Shut it, all of you!

294
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:30,083
Shut it, all of you.

295
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:33,724
Ju Kyung's passed out.

296
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:36,454
Are you sleeping, Ju Kyung?

297
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:37,663
Is he coming?

298
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:40,064
Why isn't he here yet? He
should take care of her.

299
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:43,564
Here he is. Over here!

300
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:50,804
Hey. Who made Ju Kyung drink?

301
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:52,103
She drank on her own.

302
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:53,974
- Don't blame us.
- Whatever.

303
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:55,613
- Let's drink.
- Ju Kyung.

304
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:57,984
Hey, Ju Kyung. I'm here.

305
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,554
Okay? Wake up.

306
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,794
You're here.

307
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:28,413
- Seo Jun.
- Yes?

308
00:24:30,944 --> 00:24:33,413
You're dead!

309
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:36,254
Chen keeps bugging me because of you.

310
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:39,284
Hey. Stop it.

311
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:40,754
You'll knock over the drinks.

312
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:41,954
Stop it.

313
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:43,823
You're dead.

314
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:45,024
Pour some for her.

315
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:47,464
- Drink!
- Stop it!

316
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:49,633
- I don't see you!
- Hey. Hey.

317
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,833
Calm down.

318
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:52,103
Knock knock.

319
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,633
Knock knock. I want to go home.

320
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:57,274
- She's drunk.
- She's wasted.

321
00:24:57,274 --> 00:24:58,673
- You're drunk too.
- Hey.

322
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:02,073
- You're kind of cute.
- Ju Kyung.

323
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:04,514
Come on.

324
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:08,183
I'll take her home. You guys go without us.

325
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:10,623
- Okay. Bye.
- Thanks. See you.

326
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:11,823
Come after.

327
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:13,583
- Let's go.
- Where should we go?

328
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:15,323
Hey. Just get on my back.

329
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:17,863
No. I'm not drunk. I can walk.

330
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:20,994
Fine. Get over here. Come on.

331
00:25:20,994 --> 00:25:22,194
I'm walking well.

332
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:23,663
- Wait.
- I'm walking.

333
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:25,704
Get on my back. Get on.

334
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:29,403
Look. Small octopus. Hey, octopus.

335
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:31,573
Go to the ocean with me.

336
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:33,643
- Go to the ocean with me.
- Hey.

337
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:35,244
I'll free you.

338
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:36,913
What are you doing?

339
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:38,113
- People eat that, you know.
- I'm sorry, sir.

340
00:25:38,113 --> 00:25:41,183
Taxi. Taxi!

341
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:43,014
Drive me home, please.

342
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,123
Where did she go?

343
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:46,784
- Let's go home.
- What do you think you're doing?

344
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:48,353
- Let's go!
- Miss...

345
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:50,194
I apologize for this. Ju Kyung, let's go.

346
00:25:50,194 --> 00:25:51,893
Ju Kyung, come on.

347
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:53,994
- Let's go home.
- Come here.

348
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:57,933
Hey, you are making me feel sick.

349
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:02,034
Have you snapped out of it?

350
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:06,444
If you have, you wouldn't
have acted that way.

351
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:08,774
Grabbing a live small
octopus out of the tank?

352
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:15,054
My stomach feels queasy
from the way you carried me.

353
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:17,214
Then just throw it all up.

354
00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:18,724
No, that'd be a waste.

355
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:20,524
I'm going to digest it all.

356
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:24,464
It'll all go down once I sit for a while.

357
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:26,923
You know how it is. I'm fine now.

358
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:29,663
Seo Jun.

359
00:26:32,863 --> 00:26:34,974
Han Seo Jun.

360
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,343
What now?

361
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:43,343
Can you please meet with Chen just once?

362
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:44,544
I already declined.

363
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:47,984
Can't you make my life easier just this once?

364
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:50,113
Just agree to a meal with her.

365
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:51,784
Could you go on a date with
someone you don't like?

366
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,524
I'm not asking you to be her boyfriend.

367
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:55,554
That's enough.

368
00:26:55,554 --> 00:26:57,923
Just meet her this one time!

369
00:26:58,194 --> 00:27:00,623
Stop telling me to meet other women...

370
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:02,794
because it annoys me to bits.

371
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,504
- Why's that?
- Why?

372
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,633
Isn't it about time you knew how I felt?

373
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:33,194
My head...

374
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:49,774
Ju Young, pass me some water.

375
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:51,744
Cut back on the drinking, will you?

376
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:53,244
You're worse than Hee Kyung.

377
00:27:53,244 --> 00:27:54,314
What?

378
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,113
Where did you just kick?

379
00:27:57,683 --> 00:28:00,153
Did you sleep over last night?

380
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:01,724
How could I send him home...

381
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:03,194
when he carried you home hair
wet from all the sweating?

382
00:28:03,623 --> 00:28:05,663
Must you embarrass me in front of him?

383
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:07,694
Is that so?

384
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,464
I don't remember anything
after I left the bar.

385
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,433
I completely blacked out.

386
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:16,974
You must be so proud.

387
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:19,843
I hear Seo Jun will make his debut soon.

388
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:21,314
Yes, we agreed on a concept...

389
00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:22,774
and all we need to do is
decide on a lead single.

390
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:23,843
Nice.

391
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:25,784
You can hand that over without washing it.

392
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:28,583
Once you make it big,

393
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,623
I'll sell it online as the clothes you wore.

394
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:33,353
Unbelievable.

395
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:36,823
Will we not get to see you often...

396
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:38,464
once you become a top celebrity?

397
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:40,024
Nonsense. I'll come by every day.

398
00:28:40,194 --> 00:28:41,333
To see Ju Kyung?

399
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,933
No, to eat the food you make.

400
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:51,044
How is it better than what my mom makes?

401
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:53,774
I was known to be good at
everything other than studying.

402
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,814
If you want, I can pack you
some young radish kimchi.

403
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:56,913
Some?

404
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,044
I'd like a lot, please.

405
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:02,284
Sure. Eat up and I'll pack some for you.

406
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:13,964
It's for you to eat at your dorm.

407
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:15,464
Work hard and take care.

408
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:16,494
Ju Kyung.

409
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:21,903
- What?
- About yesterday.

410
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:24,774
What about yesterday?

411
00:29:25,403 --> 00:29:27,373
You really don't remember anything
from when we left the bar?

412
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:29,673
No, I don't.

413
00:29:29,974 --> 00:29:32,214
Did I behave indecently in any way?

414
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:33,413
You really don't remember?

415
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:35,754
Of course, I don't. Why would I lie to you?

416
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,383
Stop pretending that you don't remember.

417
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:40,024
This isn't me pretending.
I don't remember a thing.

418
00:29:40,024 --> 00:29:41,123
We kissed.

419
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:03,113
Let's go.

420
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:08,254
Hop on.

421
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,694
Let's go.

422
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:16,754
Let's go home.

423
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,524
Ms. Hong will be waiting for me.

424
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,433
Let's go.

425
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:26,603
Hey. We didn't kiss!

426
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:28,734
How can you know when you don't remember?

427
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:30,704
What?

428
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:33,143
So you do remember.

429
00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:36,413
It's why you've been walking on
eggshells around me all morning.

430
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,083
I've known you for years now.

431
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:40,714
What was I supposed to do?

432
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,214
And what if I do remember?

433
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:44,254
It'll only make things awkward between us.

434
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:46,183
You were just drunk and confused...

435
00:30:46,183 --> 00:30:47,323
I wasn't confused...

436
00:30:48,754 --> 00:30:50,323
and it wasn't a drunken mistake.

437
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:56,464
I never dreamed about telling
you in this ridiculous way,

438
00:30:56,464 --> 00:30:58,663
but you kept bringing Chen up and...

439
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,234
What does any of this matter though?

440
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,173
Just forget about it all.

441
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:06,204
Forget it happened and wait for me.

442
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:07,944
I'll properly tell you how I feel someday.

443
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:33,734
What on earth? Seo Jun likes me?

444
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:39,044
No way. I bet it's a joke.

445
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:40,843
Is it April Fool's Day?

446
00:31:41,673 --> 00:31:42,843
It isn't.

447
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,653
Then why...

448
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:51,623
Since when?

449
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,633
Cho Rong, what do I do?

450
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:11,143
You waited two years to
tell her how you feel,

451
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:13,403
but you finally did so out
of anger and at her house...

452
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:14,514
while holding a container full of kimchi...

453
00:32:14,944 --> 00:32:16,444
at eight in the morning...

454
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:18,244
looking like that?

455
00:32:18,244 --> 00:32:20,683
I never confessed my feelings, all right?

456
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:22,683
I just told her I would someday.

457
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:24,383
It was like a teaser.

458
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,923
- A teaser? Are you kidding me?
- Darn it.

459
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:29,423
Okay, fine. Just don't shed any tears.

460
00:32:29,423 --> 00:32:32,764
I've been losing too much muscle
to join you on the crying.

461
00:32:34,363 --> 00:32:36,933
But maybe this is for the best.

462
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,004
If you hadn't gotten angry, Lee Soo Ho...

463
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:41,103
You would've thought...

464
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:43,173
you were betraying Soo Ho
by telling her how you feel.

465
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:44,944
So it was for the best.

466
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:49,843
Now that the cat's out of the bag,

467
00:32:51,014 --> 00:32:52,143
just keep pushing forward.

468
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,583
How does one confess his feelings?

469
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,484
Don't you watch TV dramas?

470
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:58,623
The guys you see in them...

471
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:00,083
rent an amusement park for the day,

472
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,093
have a helicopter fly above her,

473
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,254
or take her on a cruise ship...

474
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:06,494
to shoot fireworks into the sky.

475
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:08,034
I'm not rich, you know.

476
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:09,593
Where would I get the money?

477
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:11,803
Right. Of course.

478
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:15,774
Then, let your face do all the work.

479
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,774
Anything you do will look cool.

480
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:19,074
Check this out.

481
00:33:19,574 --> 00:33:21,243
Fix your eyes with a longing gaze.

482
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:23,973
Once I drink this,

483
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:26,143
you'll be my girlfriend.

484
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:28,984
I won you over, didn't I?

485
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,513
Try it yourself.

486
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:34,893
Be my girlfriend.

487
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:40,524
My heart just skipped a beat.

488
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:43,333
My heart's pounding like crazy!

489
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,064
Seo Jun, do just that.

490
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,134
- Really?
- She won't be able to refuse you.

491
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:51,774
Will you be my girlfriend?

492
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:53,873
Be my girlfriend.

493
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:55,844
Be my girlfriend, please.

494
00:33:56,913 --> 00:33:59,643
Stop that, okay? My heart's
skipping too many beats.

495
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:01,754
Don't do that either.

496
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:04,114
LIM JAE PIL

497
00:34:06,384 --> 00:34:09,024
Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you.

498
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,524
I'm Lim Jae Soon.

499
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:15,663
Hello, I'm Mr. Prince from Prince Comics.

500
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,393
I love you.

501
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:20,634
Seriously? You can't be that straightforward.

502
00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:22,703
Let's change roles this time.

503
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:25,143
Hello,

504
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,574
- it's good to meet you.
- Likewise.

505
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:29,544
What on earth...

506
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:32,913
- are you doing here though?
- What do you mean?

507
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:35,583
A flower should be in a flower garden.

508
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:37,614
What are you up to?

509
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:40,384
I'm giving him pointers for
his blind date tomorrow.

510
00:34:40,384 --> 00:34:41,424
Really?

511
00:34:41,424 --> 00:34:44,824
I hope it works out this time
and you get to marry next year.

512
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:46,723
- I'll need a willing partner.
- And she's out there.

513
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:49,194
She's out there somewhere, so get searching.

514
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,964
Take our Hee Kyung for example.

515
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,603
She's always been against marriage,

516
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:54,873
but she met a guy and will get married soon.

517
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:56,833
Just a second.

518
00:34:58,203 --> 00:34:59,303
Jae Pil?

519
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,373
What's up with him?

520
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:04,643
He gets emotional whenever Hee
Kyung's wedding is mentioned.

521
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:08,553
He must be upset to marry her off.

522
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:12,754
By the way, don't you get to know
if Ju Young got into college today?

523
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:15,993
Yes, but I have no doubt he'll get into one.

524
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:17,524
All right...

525
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,864
2022 ADMISSION RESULTS

526
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:24,734
- Let's check at the same time.
- No way.

527
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:25,803
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Scissors.

528
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:27,533
- Nice!
- Darn it.

529
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,303
You're up first.

530
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,373
Did I get in?

531
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,873
- No way.
- Why? Did I not get in?

532
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:38,044
You got accepted!

533
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:39,183
Are you serious?

534
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:45,283
Ju Young, let's go out!

535
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,493
Nice! I'm so happy!

536
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:53,294
It's time to check yours now.

537
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:57,433
What? You didn't get in.

538
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,433
Forget what I said. I take it back.

539
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:07,174
What's with those two?

540
00:36:07,544 --> 00:36:08,743
I thought they were best friends.

541
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:10,174
When did they start liking each other?

542
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:13,743
Isn't it about time you knew how I felt?

543
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:25,723
Let's eat dinner together tomorrow.

544
00:36:25,993 --> 00:36:28,933
Don't bother trying to avoid
me. Let's meet up and talk.

545
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:30,663
Forget it happened and wait for me.

546
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:32,433
I'll properly tell you how I feel someday.

547
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,444
I asked for the point brush.

548
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:45,614
I'm sorry.

549
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:49,783
- Just a second.
- Move.

550
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:52,984
Get to your senses.

551
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,123
I don't need you right now,
so go wait somewhere else.

552
00:36:57,654 --> 00:36:59,024
I'm sorry.

553
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,134
You're in the way. Just go.

554
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,234
What's the matter with me?

555
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:14,174
Please sign this sheet and make
a donation for kids in Africa.

556
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:15,314
Thank you.

557
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:17,214
Please sign this sheet.

558
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:19,384
Thank you. Please sign this sheet.

559
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:21,984
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye. Go home safely.

560
00:37:24,353 --> 00:37:25,453
Ju Kyung.

561
00:37:29,053 --> 00:37:30,254
Are you okay?

562
00:37:32,993 --> 00:37:34,893
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

563
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:47,544
All the difficult times I had

564
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:52,913
Melt away like the snow

565
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:56,953
I still hope for

566
00:37:56,953 --> 00:37:59,183
- Is there a girl?
- He must be seeing someone.

567
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:01,154
- He's waiting for her text.
- No, I'm not.

568
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:05,064
- Look at him.
- See? It's a girl.

569
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:06,993
Okay, sure.

570
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,833
- LET'S EAT DINNER TOGETHER. - OKAY, SURE.

571
00:38:09,694 --> 00:38:12,203
Let's meet tomorrow after you get off work.

572
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,433
LET'S MEET TOMORROW AFTER YOU GET OFF WORK.

573
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:21,743
See you tomorrow.

574
00:38:35,953 --> 00:38:38,094
I can't believe that beautiful fairy...

575
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:39,964
is going to be my wife.

576
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:41,393
My gosh, you're doing it again.

577
00:38:42,163 --> 00:38:45,203
I don't need to wear this, right?
And this is a little tight.

578
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,603
So get me a size bigger than this.
I think I'm done trying on dresses.

579
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:51,174
Hee Kyung, you should try on more.
You can try on three in total.

580
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,373
What do you think about trying
on the bell line wedding dress?

581
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:55,114
I think that one will look nice on you.

582
00:38:55,114 --> 00:38:56,913
What matters is that we're getting married.

583
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,114
The dress isn't important.

584
00:38:59,913 --> 00:39:02,214
You're so easy-going.

585
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,953
Then should we let the groom
pick out his tuxedo first?

586
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:06,984
Sure.

587
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:19,263
Hee Kyung.

588
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:26,243
What do you think?

589
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:28,814
You look great. Let's go with that one.

590
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:31,814
But wasn't the first one better?

591
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:34,614
The first one? This one looks similar.

592
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:37,683
- Tuxedos are all the same.
- What are you talking about?

593
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:40,723
The first one was a black
notch lapel tuxedo with a vest.

594
00:39:40,824 --> 00:39:42,824
This one is a deep navy shawl lapel tuxedo...

595
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:44,864
with a cummerbund.

596
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,464
The one I tried on earlier
had a straight collar.

597
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:49,163
But this one is round.

598
00:39:49,163 --> 00:39:52,163
Depending on the collar, I could
either look sharp or gentle.

599
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:53,663
It really has a big effect on my impression.

600
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:56,234
Do you know how important that
is on the day of the wedding?

601
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:57,973
People will comment on whether or
not you're marrying a handsome...

602
00:39:57,973 --> 00:40:01,243
You're so handsome that the
tuxedo doesn't even stand out.

603
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,114
You're not being serious.

604
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:07,013
Okay, fine. Try on the next one.
This time, I'll be extra attentive.

605
00:40:07,344 --> 00:40:08,484
Try on the next tuxedo.

606
00:40:15,953 --> 00:40:19,263
- What do you think?
- The tuxedo has found its owner.

607
00:40:19,364 --> 00:40:20,723
You're glowing.

608
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:23,464
Really? This one's the same
one I wore just a minute ago.

609
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:25,864
I didn't get changed.

610
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:27,964
What? My gosh.

611
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,373
You're lying.

612
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:31,774
We'll just call it a day.

613
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:35,944
Honey. Joon Woo. Joon Woo.

614
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,044
Honey.

615
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:42,754
Are you upset?

616
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:45,654
No, why would I be upset?

617
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,553
But it feels like I'm the
only one getting married.

618
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,223
What are you talking
about? You're marrying me.

619
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:55,864
It just feels like I'm the only one
who's excited about the wedding.

620
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,734
Okay, fine.

621
00:40:58,134 --> 00:41:00,433
I'm sorry, okay?

622
00:41:01,004 --> 00:41:02,134
What are you sorry about?

623
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:05,473
Well...

624
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,703
I'm just sorry about everything.

625
00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:11,683
Call me once you realize why you're sorry.

626
00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:15,154
Joon Woo. Joon Woo!

627
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:25,094
My gosh, how am I going to
make him feel better this time?

628
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:47,214
Mist.

629
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:50,214
Here.

630
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:55,824
I don't think I can walk. My feet hurt.

631
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:57,524
Just a second.

632
00:42:07,703 --> 00:42:08,774
Here.

633
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:13,044
Go pick it up.

634
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:15,074
Chen, that's a bit too...

635
00:42:24,254 --> 00:42:25,324
Seo Jun.

636
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:28,024
It's Seo Jun! Hey, Seo Jun!

637
00:42:30,024 --> 00:42:33,464
Seo Jun, how did you know my
album came in first place?

638
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:35,393
I can't believe you bought me flowers.

639
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:38,504
Here.

640
00:42:44,774 --> 00:42:46,404
- Hey.
- Yes?

641
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:48,044
- Do you have no hands?
- Me?

642
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:51,413
Hands? I have hands.

643
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,254
Then go get it yourself.

644
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:00,853
- Hey.
- Yes?

645
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:02,623
She can go home now that
her schedule's done, right?

646
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,623
Yes, we're going to go home
after we move everything.

647
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:07,223
- You can get off work, Ju Kyung.
- No, I'll take everything upstairs.

648
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,433
- We'll be off now.
- Okay.

649
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,564
- See you.
- Let's go.

650
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:12,103
But...

651
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:15,004
I'm sorry. I'll be off
now. I'll see you tomorrow.

652
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:20,973
Gosh, what's his problem?

653
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:36,393
- Why are you standing there?
- What?

654
00:43:37,853 --> 00:43:38,924
No, it's nothing.

655
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:45,763
But is it okay to come
here dressed like this?

656
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:46,933
You look pretty.

657
00:43:54,774 --> 00:43:56,214
You're holding it upside down.

658
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:10,654
- What do you think?
- What?

659
00:44:12,924 --> 00:44:15,734
It's delicious. It's nice here.

660
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:19,103
- Are you nervous?
- No.

661
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:20,833
Why would I be nervous?

662
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:25,803
Well, I am.

663
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:30,274
After I told you how I felt yesterday,

664
00:44:31,243 --> 00:44:34,944
I kept trying to come up with
a fancy way to ask you out.

665
00:44:36,714 --> 00:44:39,853
But I didn't want to make a fuss
like people do in dramas or movies.

666
00:44:40,683 --> 00:44:44,194
And I figured this place
must be popular for a reason.

667
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:48,094
I'll just be straightforward with you.

668
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:53,904
I like you, Ju Kyung.

669
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:04,544
Seo Jun, I...

670
00:45:04,544 --> 00:45:06,044
I've liked you for a long time.

671
00:45:08,553 --> 00:45:10,114
But back then, I knew you liked someone else.

672
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:13,683
So I never got to ask you out,
but I couldn't give up either.

673
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,924
It's been three years since
I've felt this way for you.

674
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:20,024
But I can't keep it a secret anymore.

675
00:45:20,993 --> 00:45:23,333
I keep finding myself wanting to
tell you like I did yesterday.

676
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,634
So I can't hide it.

677
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:27,763
I just can't.

678
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:29,533
- Seo Jun...
- I'm...

679
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:32,574
begging you to see me as a guy,

680
00:45:33,203 --> 00:45:34,203
right now.

681
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:37,844
Sway a little.

682
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:39,714
Just once.

683
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:44,214
I'm not asking for an answer now.

684
00:45:46,384 --> 00:45:47,424
Three dates.

685
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:50,594
Go on three dates with me.

686
00:45:51,594 --> 00:45:52,763
As a guy and a girl.

687
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:06,504
What's wrong?

688
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,444
It's nothing.

689
00:46:10,044 --> 00:46:11,444
Hey, what's wrong?

690
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:15,614
Do you feel sick?

691
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:21,453
- Here.
- Thanks.

692
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:26,294
Gosh. I knew you'd get sick.
You were eating so quickly.

693
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:29,134
Do you need medicine?

694
00:46:29,694 --> 00:46:32,163
No. It was just a little indigestion.

695
00:46:33,263 --> 00:46:34,504
Were you that uncomfortable?

696
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:36,973
No.

697
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:39,544
This is nice.

698
00:46:41,004 --> 00:46:43,143
Be uncomfortable whenever
you see me from now on.

699
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:46,114
I want you to be nervous around me...

700
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:48,953
and very aware of me as I am.

701
00:46:51,924 --> 00:46:53,083
But don't get sick.

702
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:14,444
I'm...

703
00:47:15,274 --> 00:47:18,714
begging you to see me as a guy, right now.

704
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,254
Sway a little.

705
00:47:25,013 --> 00:47:26,083
Just once.

706
00:48:26,143 --> 00:48:28,143
Why did you open this?

707
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:06,223
I really don't have the
time to do this right now.

708
00:49:11,694 --> 00:49:14,564
My dear brother-in-law. Thank you very much.

709
00:49:15,993 --> 00:49:18,064
Get something to eat with
this, my dear brother-in-law.

710
00:49:19,203 --> 00:49:21,634
My dear brother-in-law.
Why don't we put a heart...

711
00:49:21,634 --> 00:49:23,234
at the end of the candle walkway?

712
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:25,574
Why don't we brothers-in-law do it together?

713
00:49:31,143 --> 00:49:32,243
Where are you going?

714
00:49:32,243 --> 00:49:33,614
To the convenience store.

715
00:49:33,614 --> 00:49:35,984
Help us blow these up.

716
00:49:38,783 --> 00:49:40,623
I'm dizzy. I can't do this any more.

717
00:49:44,453 --> 00:49:47,194
- Are you crying?
- It's really happening.

718
00:49:47,424 --> 00:49:48,933
Hee Kyung's getting married.

719
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:50,163
There you go again.

720
00:49:50,464 --> 00:49:53,564
Hee Kyung is the one who should cry, not you.

721
00:49:55,404 --> 00:49:56,404
No.

722
00:49:56,603 --> 00:49:58,473
I should tip her off.

723
00:49:58,473 --> 00:50:01,243
It's a surprise. You can't tell her.

724
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:03,174
Honey.

725
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:08,283
Hey.

726
00:50:10,553 --> 00:50:13,123
Joon Woo is over right now,

727
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:16,294
setting things up for a surprise proposal.

728
00:50:16,294 --> 00:50:17,453
What? A proposal?

729
00:50:17,924 --> 00:50:20,464
That's why he acted like
he was upset earlier.

730
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:23,333
He's super excited about
making it all moving,

731
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,933
so you have to cry.

732
00:50:25,094 --> 00:50:27,004
Make yourself cry.

733
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:28,904
I can't force myself to cry.

734
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:30,634
Fine.

735
00:50:32,544 --> 00:50:34,973
Why is he so cute?

736
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,513
How do I make myself cry?

737
00:50:40,743 --> 00:50:43,154
Darn it. When was the last time I cried?

738
00:50:47,123 --> 00:50:48,254
Here.

739
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,393
SOJU, BEEF JERKY

740
00:50:50,453 --> 00:50:52,163
It's the first snowfall already?

741
00:50:52,163 --> 00:50:53,864
It's so annoying when it snows.

742
00:50:55,064 --> 00:50:56,393
It's 5.7 dollars.

743
00:51:06,444 --> 00:51:09,544
On the first day of snow,
I'm going to go to Namsan...

744
00:51:10,544 --> 00:51:12,044
and make a wish hoping
that you'll remember me.

745
00:51:16,953 --> 00:51:18,953
I love stuff like this.

746
00:51:21,783 --> 00:51:23,154
The nightscape looks so pretty.

747
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:09,734
Soo Ho!

748
00:52:17,944 --> 00:52:19,143
I'm sorry.

749
00:52:31,694 --> 00:52:33,424
My girlfriend likes strawberries.

750
00:52:45,944 --> 00:52:47,004
Hey.

751
00:52:48,504 --> 00:52:49,774
Of course, I'm here.

752
00:52:49,774 --> 00:52:51,013
It's cold, so dress warmly.

753
00:53:04,323 --> 00:53:06,663
Maybe I should check my prescription.

754
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:33,783
I can't calm down.

755
00:53:38,294 --> 00:53:41,364
YOU'RE MY WORLD AND
EVERY MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

756
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:43,634
I didn't get to say any of this.

757
00:53:44,593 --> 00:53:45,734
The flower meaning.

758
00:53:47,504 --> 00:53:48,904
I forgot that too.

759
00:53:54,073 --> 00:53:55,674
I forgot the flower meaning.

760
00:54:01,243 --> 00:54:02,854
Drinking solo is the best.

761
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:07,623
It's snowing a lot.

762
00:54:33,013 --> 00:54:34,114
What time is it?

763
00:54:48,024 --> 00:54:49,433
May I see your ticket?

764
00:54:51,493 --> 00:54:52,564
Did I drop it?

765
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,134
Just a second.

766
00:55:18,223 --> 00:55:19,323
Found it.

767
00:55:42,143 --> 00:55:44,714
HEART LOCK

768
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:49,754
Ju Kyung?

769
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:01,634
Ju Kyung...

770
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:29,794
I came over here as soon as I landed...

771
00:56:34,904 --> 00:56:35,933
and here you are.

772
00:56:52,854 --> 00:56:54,183
Your face is freezing.

773
00:56:56,524 --> 00:56:57,654
You must be cold.

774
00:57:04,294 --> 00:57:05,464
Why are you back?

775
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,504
Because I missed you.

776
00:57:12,803 --> 00:57:14,004
But we broke up.

777
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:18,513
So why did you miss me?

778
00:57:18,843 --> 00:57:20,114
Still...

779
00:57:24,614 --> 00:57:25,683
I still missed you.

780
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:31,093
I missed you so much.

781
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:43,373
I...

782
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:49,274
I haven't missed you at all.

783
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:57,413
Ju Kyung?

784
00:57:58,084 --> 00:57:59,154
Ju Kyung!

785
00:58:02,053 --> 00:58:03,154
Did you get home safely?

786
00:58:03,993 --> 00:58:06,663
Are you here to practice at this late hour?

787
00:58:06,964 --> 00:58:09,364
Yes, I didn't think I'll
be able to sleep tonight.

788
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:12,033
Why's that? Are you nervous now
that your debut is imminent?

789
00:58:13,163 --> 00:58:14,663
Anyway, keep working hard.

790
00:58:15,004 --> 00:58:18,473
By the way, Mr. Kang said
that Soo Ho got in today.

791
00:58:18,634 --> 00:58:20,174
- What?
- Didn't you know?

792
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:22,674
His father gained consciousness last month.

793
00:58:23,114 --> 00:58:26,343
The doctors called it a miracle.
That's great news, right?

794
00:58:26,944 --> 00:58:28,143
Yes, it is.

795
00:58:28,143 --> 00:58:30,354
Anyway, don't exhaust yourself
and head home soon. Bye.

796
00:58:30,584 --> 00:58:31,584
Sure thing.

797
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:35,154
Would it have killed you to call?

798
00:58:38,794 --> 00:58:41,323
The person you have reached is not available.

799
00:58:41,524 --> 00:58:43,163
- What on earth?
- Ju Kyung.

800
00:58:43,634 --> 00:58:44,734
We should talk.

801
00:58:45,163 --> 00:58:47,203
I don't want to see you right now.

802
00:58:49,163 --> 00:58:51,334
Are you hurt? Ju Kyung.

803
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:53,504
No, just go away.

804
00:58:55,104 --> 00:58:56,114
Are you all right?

805
00:58:57,343 --> 00:58:58,413
Let me take you to a doctor.

806
00:59:23,274 --> 00:59:24,533
I don't like seeing you sick.

807
00:59:58,234 --> 00:59:59,674
Why are you still here?

808
01:00:01,904 --> 01:00:03,473
I told you to leave me alone.

809
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:06,614
- How could I?
- Just go.

810
01:00:06,614 --> 01:00:07,783
I'm not going anywhere.

811
01:00:09,283 --> 01:00:10,714
Then I'll leave instead.

812
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:14,223
How are you feeling?

813
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:16,254
I'm all right.

814
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:18,053
- Do you have her test results?
- Yes.

815
01:00:18,053 --> 01:00:19,623
Is there a serious issue with her?

816
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:22,294
- Not exactly.
- If that's not the case,

817
01:00:22,294 --> 01:00:23,634
why was she in so much pain?

818
01:00:24,064 --> 01:00:25,093
What's the reason for it?

819
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:27,834
- Constipation.
- Sorry?

820
01:00:29,674 --> 01:00:31,404
Is that a serious illness?

821
01:00:32,134 --> 01:00:33,803
Don't tell me I need surgery.

822
01:00:34,073 --> 01:00:35,174
You have infrequent bowel movements.

823
01:00:35,843 --> 01:00:38,544
Because of it, you felt
temporary pain in your stomach.

824
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:43,154
The opaque parts on this image...

825
01:00:43,154 --> 01:00:44,714
indicate built-up gas and stool.

826
01:00:46,654 --> 01:00:47,654
For how long haven't you been able to go?

827
01:00:48,484 --> 01:00:50,953
Don't be ridiculous. I poop just fine!

828
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,864
Drinking doesn't help with constipation.

829
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:05,174
Ju Kyung, wait. Ju Kyung!

830
01:01:09,614 --> 01:01:11,114
You've got to be kidding me.

831
01:01:17,783 --> 01:01:19,154
What do I do?

832
01:01:26,864 --> 01:01:28,323
You're here with Mr. Lim, right?

833
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:29,663
Please follow me to the reception desk.

834
01:01:30,163 --> 01:01:31,194
Sure.

835
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:44,843
MY BELOVED HEE KYUNG, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

836
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:48,214
- I'll turn it on.
- Here she comes.

837
01:01:52,154 --> 01:01:54,823
The door opens

838
01:01:55,623 --> 01:01:58,254
And you enter

839
01:01:58,294 --> 01:02:00,663
At a first glance

840
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:04,993
I knew you were my sister-in-law-to-be

841
01:02:04,993 --> 01:02:06,604
- Ju Kyung?
- Was that Ju Kyung?

842
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:08,064
Yes, it was.

843
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,274
Just kill me already.

844
01:02:10,803 --> 01:02:12,533
Why do I bother to live?

845
01:02:13,504 --> 01:02:15,104
Talk about a humiliating reunion.

846
01:02:15,843 --> 01:02:19,513
RESTRICTED ACCESS

847
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:24,183
My sweet Grapefruit, I'm touched!

848
01:02:25,314 --> 01:02:27,884
I'm truly touched.

849
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:31,953
No, this is no good. We'll
take it from the top.

850
01:02:31,953 --> 01:02:34,464
Hee Kyung, go back outside.
You'll make another entrance.

851
01:02:34,564 --> 01:02:36,163
Darn it. But why?

852
01:02:36,163 --> 01:02:38,163
- We have to do this again.
- Are you kidding me?

853
01:02:38,334 --> 01:02:40,404
- Come on.
- Why must we do this?

854
01:02:42,064 --> 01:02:44,873
It's all right. We'll
just take it from the top.

855
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:46,444
Everything's fine, so take some deep breaths.

856
01:02:47,203 --> 01:02:48,643
It sure isn't easy to get married, is it?

857
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:05,393
- Yes?
- I dropped off your luggage.

858
01:03:06,294 --> 01:03:08,964
I can't believe you ran off
without heading home first.

859
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,024
Found it.

860
01:03:47,564 --> 01:03:48,634
Ju Kyung?

861
01:03:58,143 --> 01:03:59,274
Because it snowed.

862
01:04:00,743 --> 01:04:01,913
I heard it was this year's first.

863
01:04:02,013 --> 01:04:05,314
What? Use the car that's parked
out front. It's your dad's.

864
01:04:05,614 --> 01:04:08,084
Got it. Thank you for today.

865
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:27,303
GIRLFRIEND

866
01:04:29,774 --> 01:04:34,643
GIRLFRIEND

867
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:51,533
LEE SOO HO

868
01:05:03,174 --> 01:05:04,473
Did you go home safely?

869
01:05:12,754 --> 01:05:15,854
MISSED CALL: HAN SEO JUN

870
01:05:20,524 --> 01:05:22,323
- Seo Jun.
- Hey.

871
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:25,334
How did you know?

872
01:05:25,694 --> 01:05:26,904
I heard at the agency.

873
01:05:27,263 --> 01:05:28,533
You're unbelievable.

874
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:30,803
- How could you not call?
- I'm sorry.

875
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:33,973
I came in a rush, so I
had a lot to take care of.

876
01:05:34,444 --> 01:05:35,604
Your place hasn't changed at all.

877
01:05:38,343 --> 01:05:40,243
- I only have water.
- It's okay.

878
01:05:41,044 --> 01:05:42,143
How's your dad?

879
01:05:42,584 --> 01:05:43,783
Is he okay now?

880
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:45,053
Did he get discharged?

881
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:48,424
He's going to start getting
rehabilitation therapy.

882
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:50,223
That's great news.

883
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:53,864
Hey, you should've visited
me the moment you got here.

884
01:05:54,524 --> 01:05:55,893
I can't believe you didn't call.

885
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:57,263
I kept calling you.

886
01:05:57,933 --> 01:05:59,134
I didn't get a chance to.

887
01:06:00,604 --> 01:06:01,964
I met Ju Kyung.

888
01:06:05,933 --> 01:06:08,274
Really? You met her today?

889
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:10,913
Yes. By coincidence.

890
01:06:18,814 --> 01:06:19,954
Are you crying?

891
01:06:20,824 --> 01:06:22,524
WOOSAM SNACK

892
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:23,723
It's just spicy. That's all.

893
01:06:25,354 --> 01:06:26,893
You never had a problem eating spicy food.

894
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:32,893
Are you crying?

895
01:06:33,433 --> 01:06:34,933
Did you check your college admission result?

896
01:06:36,003 --> 01:06:37,473
Did you not get in? Is that why?

897
01:06:40,274 --> 01:06:42,173
Then why are you crying?

898
01:06:42,744 --> 01:06:43,874
Did something happen?

899
01:06:44,143 --> 01:06:45,473
I miss him.

900
01:06:48,414 --> 01:06:49,984
I miss him.

901
01:06:50,314 --> 01:06:51,914
My gosh, that punk.

902
01:06:54,784 --> 01:06:56,024
Then call him.

903
01:06:56,024 --> 01:06:57,824
Judging by his personality, he
broke up because he felt bad.

904
01:06:58,494 --> 01:06:59,723
Do you want me to call him instead?

905
01:07:02,364 --> 01:07:05,793
No. I'm going to get over him now.

906
01:07:07,433 --> 01:07:08,864
I'm almost over him.

907
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,173
What's the matter with me today?

908
01:07:15,003 --> 01:07:16,244
Maybe it's because it's snowing.

909
01:07:26,314 --> 01:07:28,423
- Seo Jun.
- Yes?

910
01:07:28,423 --> 01:07:30,194
Did you eat? Should I order something?

911
01:07:30,194 --> 01:07:31,494
Of course.

912
01:07:31,694 --> 01:07:33,994
We haven't met in a while.
Give me some updates.

913
01:07:34,124 --> 01:07:35,194
Wait here.

914
01:07:59,083 --> 01:08:01,683
My gosh, what a coincidence.

915
01:08:03,354 --> 01:08:04,723
I can't believe I met you here.

916
01:08:05,324 --> 01:08:06,354
What's going on?

917
01:08:10,093 --> 01:08:12,234
Where are you going? Where are you going?

918
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,104
Don't follow me.

919
01:08:14,204 --> 01:08:16,534
I'm not following you. I
need to go this way as well.

920
01:08:16,774 --> 01:08:17,833
That's another coincidence.

921
01:08:18,904 --> 01:08:19,944
Did you eat breakfast?

922
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:22,744
Let me see your face.

923
01:08:24,874 --> 01:08:27,513
Yesterday was the first day of
snow. Why did you go to Namsan?

924
01:08:27,843 --> 01:08:29,713
You thought of me, didn't you?

925
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:35,183
Ju Kyung, you were right.
My wish actually came true.

926
01:08:35,784 --> 01:08:37,553
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

927
01:08:37,954 --> 01:08:39,994
Your stomach might hurt
again if you run! Ju Kyung!

928
01:08:40,293 --> 01:08:41,994
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

929
01:08:42,923 --> 01:08:44,164
Taxi. Taxi.

930
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:47,803
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

931
01:08:48,204 --> 01:08:50,003
Ju Kyung! Ju Kyung!

932
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:55,973
He didn't even contact me for an entire year.

933
01:08:55,973 --> 01:08:57,343
What does he want now?

934
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:10,694
Soo Ho.

935
01:09:14,064 --> 01:09:15,723
How did you know about this place?

936
01:09:15,723 --> 01:09:16,994
What a coincidence.

937
01:09:17,593 --> 01:09:19,093
Is this where you work?

938
01:09:19,664 --> 01:09:20,763
When do you finish work today?

939
01:09:21,003 --> 01:09:23,234
Who told you? Was it Ju Young? Tae Hoon?

940
01:09:23,234 --> 01:09:24,503
I swear it's just a coincidence.

941
01:09:25,303 --> 01:09:27,973
Are you saying you came to a hair
and makeup salon by coincidence?

942
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:30,574
Yes. I came to get my hair done.

943
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:33,013
Well, good luck getting your hair done.

944
01:09:34,683 --> 01:09:35,744
Hey.

945
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:40,383
Is he an actor?

946
01:09:40,824 --> 01:09:42,524
- I don't know. He's good-looking.
- Excuse me.

947
01:09:43,354 --> 01:09:44,854
Can I please get a drink?

948
01:09:45,124 --> 01:09:47,064
I'm really thirsty.

949
01:09:47,923 --> 01:09:49,864
What are you doing? Go get him a drink.

950
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:51,664
Okay.

951
01:10:00,904 --> 01:10:03,173
He's handsome, so you should give him a lot.

952
01:10:06,013 --> 01:10:08,013
Soo Ho doesn't like sweets.

953
01:10:08,784 --> 01:10:10,753
Gosh, why do I still remember this stuff?

954
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,314
Like I care.

955
01:10:23,763 --> 01:10:25,034
Does she not even eat?

956
01:10:25,494 --> 01:10:27,333
You'll be done in 10 minutes.

957
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:28,404
Already?

958
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:31,133
Then can you straighten it back?

959
01:10:31,234 --> 01:10:32,374
I changed my mind.

960
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:35,104
I'll be off now.

961
01:10:35,104 --> 01:10:36,244
You did great, Ju Kyung.

962
01:10:36,244 --> 01:10:37,643
- Bye.
- Bye.

963
01:10:41,914 --> 01:10:43,143
I guess he's gone.

964
01:10:53,223 --> 01:10:54,293
Seo Jun?

965
01:10:55,024 --> 01:10:56,564
Hey, you finished early.

966
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,093
- What are you doing here?
- Do you have time for me today?

967
01:10:59,494 --> 01:11:00,503
What?

968
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:03,473
You promised me three dates.
Did you forget already?

969
01:11:05,433 --> 01:11:08,473
Well... Yesterday...

970
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:09,604
You met Soo Ho, right?

971
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:11,274
You heard?

972
01:11:11,673 --> 01:11:14,284
So what? That doesn't mean we can't hang out.

973
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:19,984
Today, I only want you to think about me.

974
01:11:22,223 --> 01:11:23,723
It's the least you can do to
someone who asked you out.

975
01:11:26,024 --> 01:11:27,223
Okay, fine.

976
01:11:27,864 --> 01:11:30,333
- What are we going to do?
- Just follow my lead.

977
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:33,393
Whatever.

978
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:35,133
Where are we going?

979
01:11:53,484 --> 01:11:55,683
Why do you want to ice-skate all of a sudden?

980
01:11:55,824 --> 01:11:58,753
Guys take girls ice skating
when they go on dates.

981
01:11:58,893 --> 01:12:00,963
They help them when they're about to fall,

982
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:03,024
and that gives them a chance
to become physically closer.

983
01:12:03,124 --> 01:12:05,994
They can ice-skate and enjoy
spending time together.

984
01:12:07,463 --> 01:12:09,234
I'm not a good ice skater.

985
01:12:09,763 --> 01:12:10,933
Neither am I.

986
01:12:11,904 --> 01:12:13,104
- What?
- What are we going to do?

987
01:12:15,874 --> 01:12:17,074
Here. Let me do it for you.

988
01:12:18,114 --> 01:12:20,484
Let's take a look.

989
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:23,654
You tied them well.

990
01:12:35,124 --> 01:12:37,133
Hey. Hey, be careful.

991
01:12:43,704 --> 01:12:45,503
I thought you weren't good.

992
01:12:46,374 --> 01:12:48,503
Ju Kyung, let's make a bet.

993
01:12:48,843 --> 01:12:52,013
The first person to get to
that pillar is the winner.

994
01:12:52,114 --> 01:12:54,244
- The winner gets to make a wish.
- That's so typical of you.

995
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:56,244
Come on. Let's try.
Instead, I'll go backward.

996
01:12:57,213 --> 01:12:58,284
Ready?

997
01:12:58,683 --> 01:13:01,423
1, 2, 3. Go.

998
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:05,954
- You're good.
- I'm good, right?

999
01:13:06,893 --> 01:13:08,194
- Careful.
- Okay.

1000
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:13,194
Ju Kyung.

1001
01:13:14,704 --> 01:13:15,763
Ju Kyung.

1002
01:13:17,374 --> 01:13:18,473
Ju Kyung.

1003
01:13:19,204 --> 01:13:20,643
Are you okay? Did you get badly hurt?

1004
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:21,944
No, I'm okay.

1005
01:13:22,444 --> 01:13:23,503
Let's get you up.

1006
01:13:23,843 --> 01:13:25,274
1, 2, 3.

1007
01:13:27,183 --> 01:13:28,244
Is it bad?

1008
01:13:28,744 --> 01:13:30,143
No, it's just a small scratch.

1009
01:13:31,414 --> 01:13:33,484
- Give me that. I'll do it.
- Let me see.

1010
01:13:42,494 --> 01:13:43,633
I'm sorry.

1011
01:13:46,234 --> 01:13:47,333
I'm sorry.

1012
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:52,204
It's okay. I'll do it.

1013
01:13:57,944 --> 01:13:59,173
We shouldn't have made a bet.

1014
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:02,414
Why do you like making bets so much?

1015
01:14:03,543 --> 01:14:04,683
Here. Throw it out for me.

1016
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:08,354
I won, okay?

1017
01:14:37,883 --> 01:14:39,183
I want to look at earrings.

1018
01:14:39,713 --> 01:14:40,753
For Go Woon?

1019
01:14:41,154 --> 01:14:42,454
No, for myself.

1020
01:14:48,494 --> 01:14:49,564
Which one do you like more?

1021
01:14:51,793 --> 01:14:53,093
- I like this one.
- This?

1022
01:14:54,503 --> 01:14:55,534
I'll take this.

1023
01:14:56,133 --> 01:14:57,833
She'll pay for it. Thanks.

1024
01:14:58,173 --> 01:14:59,234
What?

1025
01:14:59,633 --> 01:15:00,774
Hey, Seo Jun.

1026
01:15:11,114 --> 01:15:12,253
It changed a lot.

1027
01:15:20,694 --> 01:15:22,864
LIM JU KYUNG'S SPOT. SIT WITHOUT
PERMISSION, AND GET A HAIRY BUTT!

1028
01:15:26,864 --> 01:15:29,234
After all this, you want to break up? Jerk.

1029
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:30,774
I hope you get constipation.

1030
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,154
Where are you?

1031
01:15:46,753 --> 01:15:48,053
I'll wait.

1032
01:15:48,053 --> 01:15:49,624
WHERE ARE YOU? I'LL WAIT.

1033
01:15:49,624 --> 01:15:51,824
You bought me the earring,
so I'll pay for this.

1034
01:15:53,024 --> 01:15:54,524
I should've ordered something expensive.

1035
01:15:54,923 --> 01:15:56,164
This is expensive.

1036
01:15:57,194 --> 01:15:58,263
It's good.

1037
01:16:00,093 --> 01:16:02,604
WHERE ARE YOU? I'LL WAIT.

1038
01:16:11,914 --> 01:16:14,744
It's too rich. Do you want ice cream?

1039
01:16:15,383 --> 01:16:16,614
- What?
- Excuse me.

1040
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:18,414
- Yes?
- Mint ice cream please.

1041
01:16:18,414 --> 01:16:20,624
- Okay.
- Make it cold please.

1042
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:21,624
Okay.

1043
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:24,154
- Make it minty.
- Okay.

1044
01:16:26,893 --> 01:16:27,893
COMICS

1045
01:16:30,263 --> 01:16:32,263
You didn't have to walk me home.

1046
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:35,164
It's because we're a guy and a girl today.

1047
01:16:35,933 --> 01:16:37,503
I wouldn't if we were friends.

1048
01:16:41,404 --> 01:16:43,274
You live too close to the station.

1049
01:16:44,343 --> 01:16:47,074
What do you mean? It's so far.

1050
01:16:47,284 --> 01:16:49,343
No, it isn't. It's super close.

1051
01:16:50,984 --> 01:16:53,954
We're here. Get home safely.

1052
01:16:55,883 --> 01:16:56,923
Ju Kyung.

1053
01:16:58,293 --> 01:16:59,454
Yes?

1054
01:17:01,593 --> 01:17:02,624
I'm...

1055
01:17:04,433 --> 01:17:05,494
using my wish.

1056
01:17:27,654 --> 01:17:30,154
PRINCE COMICS

1057
01:17:59,683 --> 01:18:01,583
SPECIAL THANKS TO JUNG JOON

1058

SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM YOUNG
DAE FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1059
01:18:27,045 --> 01:18:29,593

<i>Those memories don't hurt as much anymore.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1062
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:38,924
<i>Do you still like Ju Kyung?</i>

1063
01:18:39,153 --> 01:18:41,724
<i>No. We're going out.</i>

1064
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:44,533
<i>Hey. It's Ju Kyung.</i>

1065
01:18:44,764 --> 01:18:46,793
<i>He's acting weird! He's all limp.</i>

1066
01:18:46,964 --> 01:18:48,333
<i>I'm going to start studying.</i>

1067
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:50,804
<i>I want to learn properly from the basics.</i>

1068
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:55,144
<i>Know something? It was my last day.</i>

1069
01:18:56,743 --> 01:18:57,943
<i>Don't go.</i>
