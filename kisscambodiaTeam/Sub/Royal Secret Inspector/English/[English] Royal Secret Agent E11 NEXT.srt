{\an8}EPISODE 11

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,500
My lord, the book reader is here.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,180
I am your new book reader,

4
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,490
Hong Dain.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Sit.

6
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,340
Dain.

7
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,040
I like your name.

8
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,610
Did you bring the book?

9
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,010
Yes, Lord.

10
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,010
Do you know what kind of book that is?

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,350
I heard a woman named Geumwon wrote this
after traveling to Geumgangsan.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,150
Correct.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,359
You must still long for Geumgangsan.

14
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:06,930
Why do you think so?

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,859
The book is a travel journal
to Geumgangsan,

16
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,560
and the painting on the wall

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,770
is Gyeomjae's painting of Geumgangsan,

18
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,670
so I simply presumed.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,139
I am impressed.

20
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,280
All I have left are memories.

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,450
"The peaks flaunt their beauty,

22
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,750
but the longer I look,
more extraordinary they become.

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,590
As if a lotus flower carved
from white jade,

24
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,960
its glow reaches
the Big Dipper and Altair,

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,910
making one believe pure spirit
of heaven and earth

26
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,000
and splendid vitality of nature
radiate from this place.

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,940
Suddenly my heart feels pure,

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,890
and I feel as if I can soar above the clouds

29
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,840
accompanied by a divine immortal.

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,950
I stand here and look down
on the various peaks,

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,720
and I realize this peculiar scenery
is extraordinary,

32
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,690
and of all the peaks, Birobong
is the most outstanding."

33
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,060
Lord.

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,200
Who sent you?

35
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:20,429
I beg your pardon?

36
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,940
Your appearance is too good
to be a mere book reader.

37
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,810
I do not understand.

38
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,340
Mentioning Gyeomjae
and trying to gain my favor

39
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,350
tells me someone sent you with a goal.

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,520
If you value your life, tell me.

41
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,590
Who sent you?

42
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,790
Now!

43
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,620
You are mistaken, Lord.

44
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,560
Do you still refuse to talk?

45
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,570
Fine, as you wish, I will kill you.

46
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,900
My lord! What is happening?

47
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,380
It is nothing. Leave.

48
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,550
It was a test.

49
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,120
Had someone sent her,
she would have spilled the name by now.

50
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,090
Continue reading the book.

51
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,370
Mix them well so it is unnoticeable.

52
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,480
Carefully!

53
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,710
Sir.

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,710
Stop.

55
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,150
He has decided to assist us.

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,760
So I've heard.

57
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,560
You are an outstanding archer?

58
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,890
You are too kind.

59
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,700
Would you mind demonstrating your skills?

60
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,950
What is that?

61
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,450
Ordinary archery is boring.

62
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,420
When it comes to archery,
drinking can only enhance your skills.

63
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,460
Am I wrong?

64
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,100
One bowl per arrow.

65
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,400
The match ends when the rice wine is gone.

66
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,090
Bull's-eye!

67
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,830
No, sir.

68
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,300
You lose complete control when you drink.

69
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,540
Whether or not I lose control,

70
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,310
it is too late to step down.

71
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,450
This is out of my hands.

72
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,530
Bull's-eye!

73
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,960
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye.
When he shoots, he is good.

74
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,530
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye.

75
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,480
Bull's-eye!

76
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,690
Bull's-eye!

77
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,970
Bull's-eye!

78
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,500
Yes, yes.

79
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,530
Bull's-eye!

80
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,640
We won, we won.

81
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,040
You won.

82
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,310
That was entertaining.

83
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,380
Sir, it is over.

84
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,650
You can put your bow down.

85
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,050
It is not over.

86
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,980
Oh no. You're drunk.

87
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,120
Lord Seong.

88
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,460
What are you doing?

89
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,060
Move, move.

90
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,710
What are you doing?

91
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,720
Put him in jail,

92
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,690
and flog him thirty times
the moment he wakes up!

93
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,690
- What?
- Yes, sir.

94
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,400
Wait.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,900
Sir, I apologize.

96
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,639
Consider him a dog at this state.
A dog, not a man.

97
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,980
Please forgive us.

98
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,950
Bye, guys.

99
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,220
No way.

100
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,520
His Majesty, the King.

101
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,610
Your Majesty,
Chief Royal Secretary Jang Taeseung

102
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,850
has committed a crime by hiding
a follower of a traitor.

103
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,120
Punish him by removing from his office.

104
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,790
- Punish the Chief Royal Secretary!
- Punish the Chief Royal Secretary!

105
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,490
Your Majesty, Chief Royal Secretary Jang
is an evil man.

106
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,000
He is using the royal agent
to distort the opinions of your subjects,

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,500
and thereby alienating Your Majesty
from the rest of your officials.

108
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,770
I can no longer stand aside
and watch his sly tongue

109
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,110
take control of the government.

110
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,780
Please consider our opinion, Your Majesty!

111
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,520
- Please consider it, Your Majesty!
- Please consider it, Your Majesty!

112
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,890
I understand your concerns.

113
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,290
I have summoned the royal agent,
so the truth will be revealed.

114
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,760
Please stand.

115
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,940
Royal Chief Secretary Jang.

116
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

117
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,880
What shall I do?

118
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,650
How much longer must I ignore them?

119
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,930
Are you truly an accomplice
of the traitor Prince Hwiyeong?

120
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,630
Tell me the truth.

121
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,230
Prince Hwiyeong became a traitor

122
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,270
not by treason but by taking his own life.

123
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,070
He admitted his treason by that very act!

124
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,880
I am suspicious...

125
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,880
Of his death.

126
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,680
Are you defending that traitor?

127
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,130
I will gladly accept
any punishment you name for me.

128
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:38,530
However, the royal agent will return
with the answer to my question.

129
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:44,000
So I beg you
to let the royal agent return safely.

130
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,630
We are here.

131
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,730
Sir.

132
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,300
Have you been well?

133
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,570
It is you, Sunae.

134
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,480
You survived.

135
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,350
It is a long story.

136
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,750
I am sure.

137
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,860
Who are they?

138
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,760
They saved my life.

139
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,330
This is the master potter.

140
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,540
I am Seong Ibeom.

141
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,190
Sit.

142
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,140
So, you want to settle here?

143
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,040
Yes, sir.

144
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,110
How did you make your living?

145
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,390
He was a hunter.

146
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,120
How dare you lie to me?

147
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,560
You answer.

148
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,660
I was a robber.

149
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,500
Lord Ibeom.

150
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Why would a robber come here?

151
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,340
I would like a new start.

152
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,740
Please let me stay, sir.

153
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,120
This will be enough to run this village.

154
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,690
Do you expect us to feed ourselves
with the money you stole?

155
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,320
A rich man in Chungcheong-do
was planning to bribe a minister

156
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,290
with that money to win the governorship.

157
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,760
If I had not interfered, that money
would have reached the corrupt officials,

158
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,370
including ministers and state councilors.

159
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,010
Please consider the villagers.

160
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,020
Lady Dain!

161
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,560
Lord Seong!

162
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,660
Help me put him down.

163
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,030
Careful, careful.

164
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,960
Oh, he reeks.

165
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,200
Chunsam, how could you
let him get this drunk?

166
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,640
The provincial office people made him
get drunk to shoot arrows,

167
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,380
so how could I stop him?

168
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,040
Rice is as expensive as gold,
but the officials are making wine with it?

169
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,210
That is disgraceful.

170
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,150
Yes! Those disgraceful men.

171
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,780
I will make my appearance
as the royal agent.

172
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,190
Chunsam, let's go.

173
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,320
Where are you going?

174
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,760
Let us go, let us.

175
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,970
Lady Dain, I will go and get some food
for his hangover.

176
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,070
How dare you?

177
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,740
Do you think you can dump that drunk
on me and escape?

178
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,810
You sure are
the sharpest person in Joseon.

179
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,420
Unless you want to hold a funeral,
go get some water.

180
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,150
Now!

181
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,040
Lord Seong. Lord Seong.

182
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,980
Dain, is that you?

183
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,150
Yes, it is I.

184
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:42,699
Everyone I hold dear is leaving me.

185
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,030
Will you also leave me?

186
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,480
Well, I guess we will no longer have
a reason to see each other

187
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,439
after we complete this mission.

188
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,390
You are drunk, so you should go inside
and get some sleep.

189
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,060
Did you know?

190
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,660
There is a wine that can help
erase your memory.

191
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,460
You mean a drunken dream?

192
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,940
It is just a story.

193
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,710
Yeah,

194
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,040
I guess people drink hoping to forget.

195
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,150
Nothing is more painful
than being unable to forget

196
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,180
what you wish to forget.

197
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,990
I know that feeling.

198
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:47,730
Nothing is more painful
than being unable to forget.

199
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,040
I am sure she has not forgotten you.

200
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,900
Sunae! Take a look at this!

201
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,710
My heart!

202
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,620
- That looks delicious!
- That looks delicious!

203
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,860
Thank you.

204
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,060
I can't wait to eat.

205
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,560
With the shortage of rice,
we were not eating well,

206
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,860
but thanks to you, everyone can eat
as much as they want.

207
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,630
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

208
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,500
It is my pleasure.

209
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,840
Enjoy.

210
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,050
Lord Ibeom, how do you like this place?

211
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,420
Is it okay?

212
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,820
Well, it is not bad.

213
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,120
Then why do you hide your feelings?

214
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,490
What do you mean?

215
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,430
Try smiling.

216
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,160
It is a good day.

217
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,530
What is good about it?

218
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,840
We are able to eat and laugh with others
without any concerns,

219
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,670
so it is a good day.

220
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,910
I smiled. Happy now?

221
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,920
This is how you smile.

222
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,720
Smile.

223
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,700
Here.

224
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,970
I am being generous.

225
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,200
Thank you.

226
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,110
Boss!

227
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,450
How long has it been?

228
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,450
What brings you here?

229
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,520
What are you two doing here?

230
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,890
We are staying
with one of Sunae's acquaintances.

231
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,390
Have you been well?

232
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,800
Are you working as a blacksmith?

233
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,660
What?

234
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,430
Yes.

235
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Have you been well?

236
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,940
How is Sunae?

237
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,670
We are well.

238
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,240
What are you doing there?

239
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,180
Who is he?

240
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,250
He is the man I told you about
the other day.

241
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,320
Oh, so he's the brilliant robber
you talked about.

242
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,420
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I am Jeon Gyesu.

243
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,870
It is an honor to meet such a famous man.

244
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,870
I know everything.

245
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,940
What you have accomplished
is quite impressive.

246
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,320
I do not understand what you mean.

247
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,920
Let us pretend we never met.

248
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,990
Come.

249
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,760
Seong Ibeom,

250
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,300
you must not understand this place
very well because you just arrived,

251
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,000
but settling down here will not be easy.

252
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,370
If you need help,
come find me at the forge.

253
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,640
There will be no need for that.

254
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,870
Let's go.

255
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,120
What if we end up as food for arrows?

256
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,990
I have never shot an arrow before,
so what am I supposed to do?

257
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,860
Sh.

258
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,430
Sir, what is it?

259
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,710
Hold!

260
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,210
Put your bow down.

261
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:09,980
What?

262
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,520
Show yourself.

263
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,420
What took you so long?

264
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,060
There are robbers everywhere,
so we took a long detour.

265
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,700
Bring it!

266
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,840
They are all there. Take them.

267
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,740
Take the rice!

268
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,610
Yes, sir.

269
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,980
Oh, and tell Lord Bae he owes me a drink.

270
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,250
He is making a fortune,
but he never shows appreciation.

271
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,950
I will tell him.

272
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,260
Sir, isn't this rice
an offering for Buddha?

273
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,100
Bae has been deceiving the governor.

274
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,630
He is bold beyond measure.

275
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,270
"Now that I have seen the grandeur
of heaven and earth,

276
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,940
human existence seems rather trivial."

277
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,780
Shall I stop reading?

278
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,550
Everything is vain.

279
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,530
But you are the governor
of Jeolla-do,

280
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,630
the position of every official's dream.

281
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,300
What is the use of power and authority?

282
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,630
I am house-ridden due to my skin disease.

283
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,970
Hearing that from you
reminds me of a story.

284
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,180
What story?

285
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,020
It is a story...

286
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,360
Of an official who worked at the palace
a very long time ago.

287
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,930
Tell me.

288
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,340
He was intelligent
and had the most beautiful face

289
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,840
that the king wished
to have him by his side.

290
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,680
The king had a son,

291
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,310
and he wanted to
become king so desperately

292
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,650
that he decided to kill his father.

293
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,690
In the dead of night,
the prince used that very official

294
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,660
to lure the king to a deserted place,

295
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,720
and killed him with a sword.

296
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,230
The prince took the throne,

297
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,700
and rewarded the official with great
fortune and a high government position.

298
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:52,940
But because he knew his secret
of killing his own father,

299
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,380
the king sent the official
to a far away countryside.

300
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,150
While on the road, the official became
parched and wanted to drink water.

301
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,250
He was about to drink water at the stream

302
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,920
when he saw his own reflection
in the water.

303
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,090
It was no longer his beautiful face,

304
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,500
but the face of a petrifying beast.

305
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,370
Why did the official's face change?

306
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:28,540
The official wished to tell people
the secret of the king's death.

307
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:35,110
But he could not do it because he knew
he would lose his life.

308
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,450
The guilt of having to keep the secret
of the death of the king,

309
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,960
who treasured him,

310
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,760
transformed him into a horrid beast.

311
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,270
Why did you tell me that story?

312
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,210
You and I share one thing in common.

313
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,370
In common?

314
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,280
Yes.

315
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,680
For a very long time,
we both lived in pain.

316
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,720
What do you mean?

317
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,460
Being unable to forget
what you desperately wish to forget

318
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,690
brings unspeakable pain.

319
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,200
That memory brings you pain, does it not?

320
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,600
What memory?

321
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,210
The memory of that day
which torments you.

322
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,240
The day Prince Hwiyeong died.

323
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,050
You!

324
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,750
Who are you to Prince Hwiyeong?

325
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,890
Tell me the truth, Lord Kim.

326
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,660
Do you not see how it is ruining you?

327
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,670
It is time for you to tell the truth.

328
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,630
You!

329
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,340
Is anyone outside?

330
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,270
Yes, my lord.

331
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,610
Take her and put her in prison.

332
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,180
Come in!

333
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,220
Tell me the truth, Lord Kim.

334
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,150
Lord Kim!

335
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,850
Lord Kim, tell me the truth!

336
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,020
Lord Kim! Lord Kim!

337
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,510
What took you so long?

338
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,810
Is something wrong?

339
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,980
The governor is enraged
because of a book reader.

340
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,210
What? I will go now.

341
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,650
You are dismissed.

342
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,850
- Yes, sir!
- Now.

343
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,650
Chunsam.

344
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,720
Yes, sir.

345
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,760
Rice is as valuable as life to people,
and I cannot let them continue

346
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,560
play tricks with it.

347
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,100
Will you announce yourself
as the royal agent?

348
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,270
Yes, and I will force the governor

349
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,840
to confess the whole truth
on what happened to Prince Hwiyeong.

350
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,940
Go and find Dain.

351
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,800
Yes, sir.

352
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,370
What?

353
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,240
What are you waiting for?

354
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,780
Sir, what is Lady Dain doing there?

355
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,450
No!

356
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,660
So the book reader
they were discussing was Lady Dain?

357
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,990
Oh, how could she?

358
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,560
There is no time. I will announce myself,

359
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,760
so you go and bring the station guards
as quickly as possible.

360
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,600
Yes, sir.

361
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,140
The book reader has been imprisoned.

362
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,110
And we have delivered
the offering for Buddha.

363
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,810
The head monk said
your illness will be cured soon.

364
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,350
Is something on your mind?

365
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,240
Lord Kim.

366
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,980
Lord Kim.

367
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,540
Leave now!

368
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,510
Yes, my lord.

369
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,320
Geez, he's so ill-tempered.

370
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,860
That is why he is not getting better.

371
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,030
What do you want?

372
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,810
Who are you?

373
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,380
I have caught a fox.

374
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,280
A fox?

375
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,140
Didn't you know

376
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,210
that a fox that borrowed
the tiger's authority

377
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,020
has been running the provincial office?

378
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,150
What?

379
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,250
Man, this is my first time
pitying a corrupt official.

380
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,860
The rice offering for Buddha you have
collected forcibly from the people

381
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,930
has been fattening the pockets
of this man.

382
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,330
What?

383
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,570
Who are you?

384
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,470
Me?

385
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,970
I am a royal secret agent.

386
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:33,526
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

387
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,990
Lord Kim Manhui?

388
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,370
What is he doing here?

389
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,980
This is maddening.

390
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,040
Darn it.

391
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Lord Choi.

392
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,720
Where is the royal agent?

393
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,690
Lord Kim, Lord Kim, have you summoned me?

394
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,730
Did you deceive me and steal
the rice offering for Buddha?

395
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,360
How did you...

396
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,530
The royal secret agent told me
of your deception!

397
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,640
Royal secret agent?

398
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,570
You!

399
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,780
How dare you deceive me?

400
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:44,110
There is no need to be too upset.

401
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:47,449
This is all your responsibility.

402
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,850
You are using grains mixed with sand
to provide high-interest loans,

403
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,420
eventually pushing people
out of their homes.

404
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,460
Tie them up, and take them out.

405
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,699
This is an order from a royal agent!

406
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:07,710
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

407
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,540
Lord Kim, I am innocent!

408
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,909
- Lord Kim, forgive me, Lord Kim!
- Lord Kim!

409
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,280
- Lord Kim!
- Lord Kim!

410
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,820
How does it feel to face the truth?

411
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,490
Facing the truth
can be frightening and unfamiliar.

412
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,100
But you cannot avoid it, can you?

413
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,000
I do not understand what you mean.

414
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,540
You must know about Prince Hwiyeong.

415
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,810
I came here to learn the truth
behind his death.

416
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,410
Prince Hwiyeong...

417
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:54,490
My lord! A seonjeonkwan
arrived from Hanyang.

418
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,550
What?

419
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,600
What brings you here?

420
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,900
Criminal Seong Igyeom
shall obey the royal command!

421
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,100
Get on the ground!

422
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,810
Criminal?

423
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,380
What do you mean?

424
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,880
Criminal Seong Igyeom colluded
with Jang Taeseung to forge King's order,

425
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,720
ignored his duty as a royal agent,

426
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,620
and conspired with Hong Dain,
a follower of a traitor.

427
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,190
Therefore, his position
as a royal agent is withdrawn,

428
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,760
and he must return to Hanyang.

429
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,260
Confiscate his horse acquisition tablet.

430
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,210
Where is the girl?

431
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,280
The girl named Hong Dain.

432
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,480
Conspired with a traitor?

433
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,510
Who is this traitor?

434
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,150
They found Prince Hwiyeong's belonging
in Dain's room.

435
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,660
And that put the government in turmoil.

436
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,160
What?

437
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,760
Prince Hwiyeong's okro?

438
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,770
Are you doing this for a measly okro?

439
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,610
When I was in Hanyang,

440
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,440
I've received
dozens of okros from high officials.

441
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:31,680
Come to think of it,
were you not one of my customers?

442
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,430
You!

443
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,260
You are the one who mentioned
Prince Hwiyeong to me first!

444
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,460
You must be associated with him!

445
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,770
Everyone knows about Prince Hwiyeong.

446
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,170
You prefer rumors and stories
over what your people have to say,

447
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,180
so I merely obliged.

448
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,180
What?

449
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,480
I have never seen such insolence.

450
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,680
Royal Agent Seong Igyeom, answer this.

451
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,260
She has accompanied you on your missions,
so you must know who she is.

452
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,960
If you tell the truth,

453
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,330
the charge against you will be cleared.

454
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,430
I will tell the truth.

455
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,540
It was I who ordered her to investigate
the case of Prince Hwiyeong.

456
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,980
Everything she said and did

457
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,180
was under my direct order.

458
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,100
Why did you provide the justification
for him announcing himself?

459
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:59,100
Reporting that both the royal agent
and the girl committed suicides

460
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,040
during the transport
will raise suspicions.

461
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,210
Lord Kim, you take care of the girl.

462
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,820
That is my father's wish.

463
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,260
When the royal agent asked
about Prince Hwiyeong,

464
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,100
I hesitated for a moment.

465
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,740
Should I recite the story everyone knows

466
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,680
or should I tell the truth no one knows?

467
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,950
Are you going to betray us
after all this time?

468
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,050
That would depend
on what Lord Kim Byeonggeun does.

469
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:52,320
How dare you mention my father's name?

470
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,860
Who made it possible for you
to take the auditor's position?

471
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,100
I cannot put my fate in the hands
of the Chief State Councilor forever.

472
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,140
Don't you know what happens to traitors?

473
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,640
Do you think killing me
will bury the truth?

474
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,350
I have proof that Prince Hwiyeong
did not commit treason.

475
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,980
Where do you think
that proof will go once I am dead?

476
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,650
Do you want to take everyone
down with you?

477
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,660
I have nothing more to lose!

478
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,840
You are a fool.

479
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:49,050
If you turn your back on us,
who will keep your family alive?

480
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,070
Why did you do it?

481
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,100
I only told the truth.
What is wrong with that?

482
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,940
I am sorry, Lord Seong.

483
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,780
I ended up putting you in danger.

484
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,480
I am fine.

485
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,150
And this is not the first time.

486
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,060
I will go and tell the truth.

487
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,630
About what?

488
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,700
That I am responsible for everything.

489
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,870
Do you understand what you are saying?

490
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,100
It means you must risk your life.

491
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,810
Do you truly think that will help me?

492
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,840
Lord Seong,

493
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,680
I am Prince Hwiyeong's daughter.

494
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,550
I am the daughter of a traitor.

495
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,780
I know.

496
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,520
Then renounce me.

497
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,860
Only then will you live.

498
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,520
I do not care who you are.

499
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,090
You belong to me.

500
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,600
A royal agent's attendant
belongs to the royal agent.

501
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,110
To whom else would you belong?

502
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,810
That is correct, Lord Seong.

503
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,680
I belong to you.

504
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,030
Bring the prisoner Seong Igyeom.

505
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,070
Lord Seong.

506
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,380
Why are you only taking him?

507
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,910
I am following the King's order
to bring the royal agent back.

508
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,160
Lord Seong, Lord Seong.

509
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,360
Wait here.

510
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,970
We will meet again.

511
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,870
I will return.

512
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:29,070
Give me a few nights, would you?

513
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Sir.

514
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,630
I trusted you and left you in control
of the provincial government,

515
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,230
so how dare you betray me?

516
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,330
Please spare us, Lord Kim.

517
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:35,140
We were planning on giving you
all the profit we made.

518
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,240
That is the truth.

519
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,370
Be quiet!

520
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:44,850
The story of robbers,
was that a lie too?

521
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,220
No, Lord Kim.

522
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,520
We did lose some of the rice to robbery.

523
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,190
Several of my men were attacked
by those robbers.

524
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,300
If that is true, go and get the rice
you lost to them.

525
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,300
If you fail, I will chop your heads off
as your punishment.

526
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,370
Do you understand?

527
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,400
- Yes, Lord Kim!
- Yes, Lord Kim.

528
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,380
Do you have any plans?

529
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,090
We must visit every house
and collect rice.

530
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,790
What?

531
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,390
Shortage of rice
has already caused an outcry.

532
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,830
There is no justification for it.

533
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,090
When did we ever have
justification for taking rice?

534
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,460
We are about to lose our heads,
so why are you concerned for them?

535
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,800
Gather your men.

536
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,600
What?

537
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,890
You were rather good,
but you drove yourself to an early grave.

538
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,230
What happened to the royal agent?

539
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,690
Do not concern yourself with him.

540
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,430
You will meet him soon.

541
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,460
What do you mean?

542
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,040
The Chief State Councilor has
ordered me to kill you,

543
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,770
so do not blame me.

544
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,080
It is not because of the lack of rice
offered to Buddha

545
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,610
that your willness cannot be cured.

546
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,180
What?

547
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,120
Do you think Buddha will accept
the rice offering

548
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,320
that came from people's blood and tears?

549
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,960
Please save the royal agent.

550
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,530
If you return to being their dog,

551
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,630
the rest of your life
will be stained with blood too.

552
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,730
You!

553
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,600
We'll see what you say
when there is a sword on your neck.

554
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,380
What is this?

555
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,260
Move aside!

556
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,070
No! Don't!

557
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,510
Let go!

558
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,610
No, no! Not there!

559
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:25,880
Please don't go there!

560
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,750
You can't! No!

561
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,780
No!

562
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,150
Sir, please don't! Please!

563
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,820
No, sir!

564
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,550
You!

565
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,360
Who are you?

566
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,960
You found what you came for,
so you should leave.

567
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,400
Mommy!

568
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,280
Are you all right?

569
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,550
My children will starve to death.

570
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,990
Sir, what brings you all the way here?

571
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,820
The rice offering to Buddha
was stolen recently.

572
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,330
We are not associated with those robbers.

573
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,970
I heard robbers have been giving away
the rice they stole.

574
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,340
That is not true.

575
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,540
Do you intend on starving
everyone to death?

576
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,740
I will go and speak to the governor!

577
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,670
Let us take a break here.

578
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,290
What is he doing here?

579
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,420
You have arrived.

580
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,460
Do you know him?

581
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,860
I do.

582
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,570
Does that mean
you were the owner of that gold mine?

583
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,400
You caused me so much damage.

584
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,140
Make sure you leave no evidence.

585
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,170
Yes, my lord.

586
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,110
I will return to Hanyang
and report to His Majesty

587
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:46,780
that the royal secret agent
took his own life while being transported.

588
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,890
You!

589
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,960
Lord Kim said that he has the evidence
to prove Prince Hwiyeong's innocence.

590
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,160
You must find out what that is.

591
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,400
Once I obtain the evidence,
what should I do with Lord Kim?

592
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:04,970
Get rid of him.

593
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,500
Yes, my lord.

594
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,540
Let us go.

595
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,940
Let go of me.

596
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,410
Kim Manhui!

597
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,080
Let go!

598
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,110
Oh, your high and mighty face is a mess.

599
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:53,980
Your spirit that commanded the world
with the horse requisition tablet is gone,

600
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,220
and all that is left is for you
to beg for your life.

601
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,920
Ask me to spare you.

602
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,460
That is serious nonsense.

603
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,700
Did you also kill Prince Hwiyeong?

604
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:14,300
Needless bravery
and uncompromising temperament.

605
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,610
You and Prince Hwiyeong are quite similar,

606
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,850
so he will be happy to see you
in the other world.

607
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:25,550
So Prince Hwiyeong was murdered.

608
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,000
I will have another company
on my journey to the other world.

609
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:47,400
Lord Kim Manhui ordered you to kill
everyone who knows the truth

610
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,310
about Prince Hwiyeong's death.

611
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,940
Kim Myeongse, me...

612
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,350
Who could be next?

613
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,980
You!

614
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,450
How dare you try to trick me?

615
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,660
You!

616
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,730
Get away! Get away!

617
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:19,040
Sir! Sir!

618
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,070
Are you all right, sir?

619
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,840
Were you waiting for me to die?

620
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,210
Lord Choi!

621
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,650
Lord Seong!

622
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:07,850
Die!

623
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:12,220
Lord Choi! Lord Choi!

624
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,260
Lord Choi.

625
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,260
Are you all right?

626
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,930
I lost him. I am sorry.

627
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,330
I'm sure he will return.

628
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,700
To this place?

629
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,870
No, to me.

630
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,510
Sir.

631
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,460
Sir.

632
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,850
Where are you going?

633
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,490
I cannot let this be.

634
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,790
What? What will you do?

635
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,220
I must go and see him.

636
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,640
I have been waiting for you.

637
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:09,730
PRINCE HWIYEONG, LEE HAN,
YOU ARE TO RAISE AND TRAIN AN ARMY

638
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:16,410
TO STOP THE INVASION FROM FOREIGN VESSELS
AND THE LOOTING OF ROBBERS

639
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,370
Father.

640
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,840
When did my daughter become a grown woman?

641
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,840
Father.

642
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,130
I must report this to His Majesty.

643
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,330
Come to Hanyang with me tomorrow.

644
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,060
Dain is still at the provincial office.

645
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,660
I must go to her first.

646
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,570
But you are no longer a royal agent.

647
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,700
Wait,

648
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,840
you want to go back there in this state?

649
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,100
You cannot.

650
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,740
I cannot lose another person
who is important to me.

651
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,240
The same goes for you, Chunsam.

652
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,780
Return to Hanyang with Lord Choi.

653
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,550
What?

654
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,090
We had to face death
several times until now,

655
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:45,690
and you have impressed me enough.

656
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,330
I will come with you.

657
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,100
And so will I.

658
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,070
It may be dangerous.

659
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:06,080
His Majesty ordered me
to protect the royal agent.

660
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,330
I must send the rice offering to Buddha.
Make preparations.

661
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,180
Lord Kim, it is Bae.

662
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,780
Enter.

663
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,190
Is the rice offering ready?

664
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,220
Yes.

665
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,060
Take this to the temple along with it.

666
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,770
What is this?

667
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:06,200
It used to belong to the temple,
so I am returning it.

668
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,910
I will not tolerate another mistake.

669
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,110
Of course, Lord Kim.

670
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,590
What did you learn?

671
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,860
They will behead Dain at noon.

672
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,300
What? Behead her?

673
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,870
Sir, what do we do?

674
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,570
Behead her at noon.

675
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,680
I must go to the provincial office.

676
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,310
Sir, where are you going?

677
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,780
He knows what to do.

678
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,750
What?

679
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,060
Are you ready?

680
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,630
Yes.

681
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:04,530
Come.

682
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:08,870
Who are you?

683
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,230
Chunsam.

684
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,900
Yes, sir.

685
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,000
Lock the door.

686
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,770
Yes, sir.

687
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,360
Execute the punishment.

688
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,160
Headsman, enter!

689
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,500
Where is the headsman?

690
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,170
What happened?

691
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,070
He is yet to arrive.

692
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,180
What? The headsman is not here?

693
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:55,150
You fools!

694
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,050
There he is.

695
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,520
Hurry up and go inside!

696
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,560
Here is the headsman!

697
01:01:59,963 --> 01:02:03,018
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

698
01:02:03,116 --> 01:02:04,225
<i>Where is the evidence?</i>

699
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,250
<i>The evidence to prove
that Prince Hwiyeong was not a traitor.</i>

700
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,250
<i>I do not know!</i>

701
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,550
<i>If you refuse to tell me,</i>

702
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,590
<i>I will take your head
and use that as proof.</i>

703
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:11,820
<i>Please spare me!</i>

704
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:15,390
<i>A gang of robbers stole all the rice
and is now after my life.</i>

705
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,590
<i>It was Ibeom who took the rice.</i>

706
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:19,400
<i>I will start searching for Ibeom tomorrow.</i>

707
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,330
<i>What is this?</i>

708
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:22,630
<i>I thought there was gold inside.</i>

709
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,470
<i>Do you know that man?</i>

710
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,870
<i>He is the man who bought
the rice offering.</i>

711
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,570
<i>The robbers must be planning
on making a deal with him.</i>

712
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:28,910
<i>What are you doing?</i>

713
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,070
<i>I must get in there.</i>

714
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:33,080
<i>I am Hong Dain, a merchant from Gimje.</i>
