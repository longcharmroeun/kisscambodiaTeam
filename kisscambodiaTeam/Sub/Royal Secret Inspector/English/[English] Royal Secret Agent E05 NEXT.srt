EPISODE 5

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,940
Lord Seong!

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,210
No!

4
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,020
If you don't want to lose your head,

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,320
put that sword down.

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,600
Lady Dain.

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,710
Chunsam.

8
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,310
Are you all right?

9
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,010
Yes, I am.

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,480
Sir!

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,350
Take Dain to safety.

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,350
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,020
I still have work to do.

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,850
Lord Seong!

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,540
On your knees!

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,950
On your knees!

17
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,110
Tie them up!

18
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,650
- Don't move.
- Stay still.

19
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,520
Lady Dain, what's wrong?

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,620
Maybe something happened to Lord Seong.

21
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,890
I should go and see.

22
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,420
No, Lady Dain.

23
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,130
Lord Seong ordered me to protect you.

24
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,300
If something bad happens to him,

25
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,870
I would be miserable.

26
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,700
Then you stay here.

27
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,140
I will go.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,480
Over there.

29
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,120
That is...

30
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,730
Lord Seong?

31
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,770
Sir!

32
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,970
Sir.

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,970
Sir!

34
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,110
What are you doing?

35
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,410
Come here.

36
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,750
Are you all right?

37
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,880
I am fine.

38
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,189
But...

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,090
But let me have a moment.

40
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,790
Lord Seong.

41
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,500
Lord Seong?

42
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,970
Lord Seong.

43
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,840
Lord Seong.

44
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,050
Are you all right?

45
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,820
You should rest more.

46
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,620
Are you all right?

47
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,120
I should ask you that.

48
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,530
I told you to go to Hanyang,
so why did you come here?

49
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,800
To rescue you.

50
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,970
You never listen to me.

51
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,940
Lord Seong,

52
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,840
you saved all those men.

53
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,380
I couldn't have done it without you.

54
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,760
Why are you crying?

55
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,160
I don't know.

56
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,320
Sir! Lord Seong!

57
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,490
Sir!

58
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,390
What? What happened?

59
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,790
Sir, my lord,

60
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,560
are you all right?

61
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,690
Let us all go home!

62
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,710
There is a baby that was born
from a courtesan.

63
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,210
Which is it?

64
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,150
- Please spare us, Sheriff.
- This is my baby. Spare us!

65
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,120
Shut up!

66
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,190
Confess now or I will kill
every one of them.

67
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,290
Please spare my baby.

68
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,660
- Please!
- Spare us!

69
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,860
This is my baby.

70
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,970
Please spare us!

71
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,430
She is a widow!

72
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,300
How can a widow give birth?

73
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,970
Where is your husband?

74
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,240
Answer me.

75
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,450
He was sent to labor camp
and died there.

76
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,550
If he was sent to labor camp,
how did you have that baby?

77
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,190
You are either unchaste or lying,

78
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,860
and both are unforgivable.

79
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,930
Kill the baby.

80
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,890
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,700
No!

82
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,860
Spare his life!

83
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,230
Please spare his life!

84
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,370
No! No!

85
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,470
No! No!

86
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,600
Please spare him!

87
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,009
Sir! Sir!

88
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,510
We're in big trouble!

89
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,380
What is it?

90
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,450
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

91
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,420
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

92
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,220
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

93
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,590
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

94
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,190
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

95
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,130
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

96
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,170
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

97
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,670
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

98
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,510
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

99
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,460
Why, you! How dare you!

100
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,270
Here comes the royal secret agent.

101
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,770
Apprehend everyone!

102
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,800
No! Not me!

103
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,960
Stay still.

104
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,770
That hurts!

105
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,760
You collected tax from dead people

106
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,460
and forced children to submit hemp cloth
to be exempt from military duty.

107
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,860
Your position was given to you
to look after your people,

108
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,530
so how dare you use it to steal from them?

109
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,270
And you must know what you've done.

110
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,570
You used your position
as the sheriff's son and harassed people,

111
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,940
and moreover, used them as game.

112
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,240
Am I wrong?

113
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,510
Bring it!

114
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,890
Now, tell me.

115
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,830
You dared to kill a royal secret agent

116
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,730
and framed innocent people
for illegal mining...

117
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,030
All for these rocks?

118
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,040
Do you know how many men
lost their lives for these rocks?

119
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,650
There was a man
who collected gold from Hwaeomsan.

120
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,320
Who is he?

121
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,120
Where does he bring the gold?

122
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,530
If I told you the truth,
would you be able to handle it?

123
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,660
What?

124
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,810
Tell me the truth.

125
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,480
Whose gold is this?

126
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,450
Stop!

127
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,250
There he is.

128
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,490
Who is he?

129
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,560
He's the seonjeonkwan sent by His Majesty.

130
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,900
I bring His Majesty's order.

131
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,140
It is the royal order!

132
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,490
Transfer the criminals Kang Inchung
and his son Kang Jonggil to Hanyang.

133
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:39,060
Punish those who collaborated with them
appropriate to the gravity of their crimes

134
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,560
according to the royal agent's decision.

135
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,300
Collect the royal subject
Park Cheolgyu's body,

136
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,900
console his spirit
and prepare it for a burial in Hanyang.

137
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,280
Everyone listen!

138
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,160
Those who were wrongfully forced
to the life of hard labor at the mine,

139
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,690
and those who became criminals
because of heavy taxes,

140
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,600
you will be cleared of all crimes
and never be charged again,

141
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,400
so return home!

142
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,620
- Hooray for the royal secret agent!
- Hooray for the royal secret agent!

143
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,450
Hooray!

144
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,260
Hooray!

145
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,420
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

146
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,770
Lord Seong,

147
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,800
how does it feel to become
a true royal agent?

148
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,370
A true royal agent.

149
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,380
It is not half bad.

150
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,630
You have returned.

151
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,860
I am actually...

152
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,530
Have you decided on the boy's name?

153
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,700
Oh, his name.

154
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,470
His name is Yunsu, Jeong Yunsu.

155
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,750
So that baby is...

156
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,250
He is Sawol's baby.

157
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,640
Raise your sister's baby well.

158
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,410
Yes, sir.

159
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,250
I will never forget your kindness.

160
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,330
We are returning to Hanyang.

161
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,830
Thank you for everything.

162
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,900
Uh, sure.

163
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,450
What are you waiting for? Come.

164
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,280
What?

165
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,620
Sir, am I not fired
from the royal agent's entourage?

166
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,590
Oh, I'm not sure.

167
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,430
If she believed Chunsam
was a royal agent and trusted him,

168
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,270
that means he conducted himself
like a royal agent.

169
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,070
Why not forgive him this once?

170
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Should I or not?

171
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,450
Fine. I will forgive you for Dain.

172
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,020
Sir!

173
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,730
Let go of me!

174
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,700
That hurts!

175
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,230
- I love you.
- Let go of me! You're heavy!

176
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,880
All the gold is gone.

177
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,850
Burn this place down and leave no trace.

178
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,980
What's wrong?

179
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,650
We should say goodbye here.

180
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,480
What do you mean? Say goodbye?

181
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,820
The palace is nearby.

182
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,260
My role ends here.

183
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,030
We shall meet again, so you should go.

184
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,060
Lady Dain, if you leave now,

185
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,300
all the glory will go to Lord Seong.

186
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,570
If it hadn't been for the two of us,

187
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,470
he couldn't have returned
to Hanyang alive.

188
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,100
Hey.

189
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,110
Chunsam, thank you.

190
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,140
Goodbye.

191
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,580
Lady Dain, are you really leaving?

192
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,550
Lady Dain!

193
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,310
Come.

194
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,240
Your Majesty, Royal Agent Seong Igyeom

195
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,180
has returned from the secret mission.

196
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,110
Stand.

197
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,620
I can see from your face
the hardship you have suffered.

198
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,290
Your Majesty.

199
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,740
Your Majesty,
I worry your dragon gown will be soiled.

200
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,680
I am very proud of having
a subject as you.

201
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,720
Come.
I want to hear your story.

202
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,180
Isn't he?

203
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,380
Wasn't he an assistant advisor?

204
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,950
That moron was the royal secret agent?

205
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,620
Come.

206
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,990
Tell me the truth of this case.

207
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,630
Sheriff Kang Inchung
and his son Kang Jonggil

208
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,540
built vast wealth with the gold
they mined illegally.

209
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,170
In that process, numerous men
were forced into hard labor

210
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,040
and lost their lives.

211
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,680
Royal Secret Agent Park Cheolgyu
discovered this

212
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,550
and lost his life to them.

213
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,150
And we discovered something peculiar.

214
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,160
Peculiar?

215
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,260
They were sending
some of the gold to someone.

216
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,260
Who were they sending them to?

217
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,200
I interrogated, but they refused to speak.

218
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,570
However, the man who received the gold
must be the owner of the gold mine.

219
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,270
He had private soldiers
manage his illegal mine,

220
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,840
so he must be a powerful man.

221
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,910
Only the sheriff and his son
know the identity of that man.

222
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,680
Where are they now?

223
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,420
They have been taken
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

224
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,850
Prepare a royal interrogation.

225
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,120
We must find out who he is.

226
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

227
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,760
What do you want to do the most now?

228
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,800
You have worked hard,

229
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,970
so you may ask anything of me.

230
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,570
I am immensely grateful
of Your Majesty's kindness.

231
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:24,740
Your words are enough of a reward.

232
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,710
Are you being honest?

233
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:33,450
However, if I may ask of one thing...

234
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,390
Yes, speak.

235
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,470
I would like to eat as much as I could.

236
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,830
What?

237
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,770
This is His Majesty's reward
so enjoy yourselves.

238
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,140
Lord Jang, where are you going?

239
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,140
This is not my reward to enjoy.

240
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,440
What will happen to Dain?

241
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,740
She will be a guest at my house for now.

242
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,710
Dain deserves great credit.

243
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,050
I am aware.

244
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,850
Enjoy the feast and rest well.

245
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,260
Thank you.

246
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,660
Sir, can I really eat that?

247
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,870
It is a royal order. Let us eat.

248
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,000
Let me pour you a drink.

249
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,440
Come to think of it,
I never had the chance to thank you.

250
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,750
We are of same age,
why not be friends?

251
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,080
When we are not on duty, we can relax.

252
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,220
Yes, Lord Seong.

253
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,590
Don't be like that. Relax.

254
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,120
This is me being relaxed.

255
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,000
Anyway, thank you.

256
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,270
You could have just returned to Hanyang.

257
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,170
I was about to.

258
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,700
But?

259
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,740
Dain stopped me.

260
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,010
She insisted on rescuing you.

261
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,380
I asked Dain about you once.

262
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,120
What did she say?

263
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,090
She said you treat
your subordinates as your friends

264
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,360
and protect the weak despite danger.

265
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,230
Oh,

266
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,160
Dain is good at reading people.

267
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,430
Don't you agree, Chunsam?

268
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,400
She must be. She saw the side of you
I never saw my entire life.

269
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,140
You.

270
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,610
You haven't forgotten the promise
you made me, have you?

271
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,250
No. Do you still believe
your father was innocent?

272
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,150
Yes.

273
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,500
When I was the sheriff of Okgu
ten years ago,

274
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,100
your father Prince Hwiyeong
retired to his hometown.

275
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,870
Governor Jang,

276
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,110
I was told that foreign vessels have been
seen often in the coastal waters of Okgu,

277
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,450
and that robbers have been
wreaking havoc on land.

278
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,510
We are making every effort to rebuild,

279
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,120
but as you well know,
the militia has been long dissolved,

280
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,220
so we are desperately short of soldiers
to focus on defense.

281
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,660
We cannot let this be.

282
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,430
Do you have a solution?

283
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,240
Instead of waiting for someone's help,

284
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,270
should we not grow our own strength?

285
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,050
Prince Hwiyeong used his own wealth

286
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,380
to provide military training
for the people.

287
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,850
That was the seed of his own ruin.

288
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,790
A vile rumor began spreading in Hanyang.

289
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,990
It said Prince Hwiyeong was headed
for Hanyang

290
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,060
with his army to begin a rebellion.

291
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,330
My father would have never done that.

292
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,200
But the world does not say that.

293
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,740
Those are the words of people

294
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,870
who wish to forget and bury his death.

295
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,910
If I can find the truth,

296
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,840
I will do anything.

297
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,320
I learned who escorted Prince Hwiyeong.

298
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,390
He witnessed the death
of your father firsthand.

299
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,060
His name is Kim Myeongse.

300
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,260
He is the governor of Jeolla Province.

301
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,630
Kim Myeongse.

302
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,560
Governor of Jeolla Province.

303
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,570
Send me there.

304
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,340
Do you think

305
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,570
you can get the answer you want there?

306
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,640
You stay put.

307
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,180
I have a plan.

308
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,410
What is that plan?

309
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,380
A new royal secret agent will
take this mission.

310
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,250
A new royal agent?

311
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,490
Who is that?
Is he trustworthy?

312
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,660
That is none of your concern.

313
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,690
It is late.

314
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,930
Let's go in.

315
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,980
As a royal secret agent, Assistant Advisor

316
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,040
Seong Igyeom of
the Office of Special Advisors

317
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,350
discovered the truth behind
the missing royal agent, Park Cheolgyu,

318
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,050
and corrected the crimes of the corrupt
official Kang Inchung

319
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,660
and his son Kang Jonggil who stole
from people and violated the law.

320
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,930
Seong Igyeom will be appointed
as a special advisor

321
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,530
as a reward for his service.

322
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,170
Additionally, Royal Agent Park Cheolgyu
will get a posthumous promotion

323
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,440
and his son,
even if he has not reached adulthood,

324
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,570
will be appointed to a position
after the mourning period.

325
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,580
- We are immensely grateful, Your Majesty.
- We are immensely grateful, Your Majesty.

326
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,630
I heard you have refused food or water.

327
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,230
Are you regretting your past?

328
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,270
Regret?

329
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,570
Yes, I should regret

330
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,310
not killing you when I had the chance.

331
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,610
Everyone who is born must die.

332
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,610
However, one must die
with an honor as a man,

333
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,050
not as a creature lower than a beast.

334
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,720
If I tell you the truth,

335
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,060
do you have the power to spare our lives?

336
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,560
If you reveal the man behind you,

337
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,000
you will escape death.

338
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,570
Do you expect me to believe that?

339
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,300
You are naive.

340
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,140
I do not know who is behind you.

341
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,780
But do you not see?

342
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,650
You have been abandoned.

343
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,150
Reconsider.

344
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,190
You are running out of time.

345
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,200
Father,

346
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,830
are you just going to
let them torture you to your demise?

347
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,040
Wait.

348
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,970
He will not let us die.

349
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,300
You were careless. That's unlike you.

350
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,230
I apologize.

351
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,130
There will be a royal interrogation.

352
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,070
They will not be able to endure it.

353
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,610
Pay them a visit.

354
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,210
I will, Lord Kim.

355
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:55,296
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

356
00:29:56,107 --> 00:30:00,647
Come! I have miracle salves from China!

357
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,890
Magical salves to turn old woman's skin
into baby skin!

358
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,960
Don't miss this once in a lifetime chance!

359
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,060
Come and see.

360
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,170
What is that?

361
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,870
If I may tell you about this,

362
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,640
if you put this salve on your skin,

363
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,210
it will become soft and smooth
as a baby's bottom.

364
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,410
Try it.

365
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,680
How do you like it?

366
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,620
Sir!

367
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,920
You're home.

368
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm hungry. Let us eat.

369
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,430
Sure. Go inside.
Someone has already made dinner.

370
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,330
Who?

371
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Lord Seong!

372
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,470
Lord Seong, congratulations.

373
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,540
Chunsam told me
you are now a special advisor.

374
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,240
Yes, but why were you in there?

375
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,980
You must be hungry. Let us go inside.

376
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,760
What are you waiting for? Eat.

377
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
What is going on?

378
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,230
What do you think? It's a happy occasion.

379
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,630
You have been promoted.

380
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,640
Eat. It is getting cold.

381
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,090
I cannot eat with your staring.

382
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,460
Oh, enjoy your meal.

383
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,780
I thought I would never see you again.

384
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,920
Were you disappointed?

385
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,620
In that case, would you like me to stay

386
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,420
with you forever?

387
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,860
Are you all right?

388
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,540
You sure are Honglang the courtesan.

389
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,650
What are you saying?

390
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,550
Tell me.

391
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,450
What are you trying to gain
by winning my favor?

392
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,690
Actually,

393
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,760
Royal Secretary Jang is searching for
a royal agent to send to Jeolla Province.

394
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,600
I thought it could help you,
so I wanted to tell you about it.

395
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,470
I am not interested
in being a royal agent.

396
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,670
But he said an even higher position
will be awarded.

397
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,510
An even higher position?

398
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,340
Yes.

399
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,250
And if you go on that mission,

400
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,920
I would like to join you.

401
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,060
You don't want me?

402
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,660
You did play a key role
in the last secret mission,

403
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,930
so having you will not be a hindrance,

404
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,370
but you already know
how dangerous it can be.

405
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,010
I do.

406
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,610
But I have trained in martial arts
since I was a child,

407
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,210
so I can protect myself.

408
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,550
How about archery?

409
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,550
I will learn.

410
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,820
That can't be so hard.

411
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,390
How will you learn?

412
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,919
You must teach me.

413
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,120
Me?

414
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,560
Yes. You killed that giant wild boar
with a single arrow.

415
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,430
If I need to learn it, I must learn it
from the best archer in Joseon.

416
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,839
True.

417
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,910
Fine. I will teach you.

418
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,480
Lady Dain, where are you going?

419
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,890
Chunsam, you should eat up.

420
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,750
What?

421
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,830
Sir, what is Lady Dain up to?

422
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,100
How odd.

423
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,930
She wants to join me on my secret mission.

424
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,470
What? You are going on a secret mission?

425
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,500
No, I did not...

426
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,580
If I am to go on a secret mission,
she will join me.

427
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,910
What has gotten into her?

428
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,980
I know.

429
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,320
You do? What is it?

430
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,360
You don't understand women at all.

431
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,490
You must understand the hidden meaning.

432
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,590
The hidden meaning?

433
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,830
She will follow you to the end,
even if it means death.

434
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,400
She's into you.

435
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,640
Wait, Into me?

436
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,340
Lady Dain is deep into you.

437
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,980
That's it.

438
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,580
No!

439
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,990
It can't be.

440
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,060
As you've ordered,
I looked into Seong Igyeom.

441
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,930
Seong Yongjae?

442
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,940
Is he Seong Yongjae's son?

443
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,170
Do you know him, Father?

444
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,110
I do, of course I do.

445
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,410
He was the chief censor of the Office
of Censors with the late king.

446
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,680
Now I can see he takes after his father.

447
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,750
He has the trust of the king, so he will
become a problem for us in the future.

448
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,990
How about framing him for a crime
to nip him in the bud, Father?

449
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,830
Do you know the easiest method
of beating your enemy?

450
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,330
It's having that enemy be on my side.

451
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,870
Take the bow and arrow.

452
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,680
If you hold it too close to your body,
the string will hit your sleeve.

453
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,210
But if you hold it too far away,
your wrist will suffer,

454
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,650
making it difficult to pull the string.

455
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,220
I am ready.

456
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,020
Stand with your feet spread apart.

457
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,460
And straighten your entire body.

458
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,400
Press against the ground with your toes

459
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
and concentrate your strength
on your calves, thighs, and rear.

460
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,100
You must have
a strong lower body to shoot arrows.

461
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,240
Yes.

462
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,040
Lift your left hand up to your forehead,

463
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,270
and pull the string with your right hand
back to your shoulder, behind the ear.

464
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,750
Inhale and hold.

465
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,250
Hold and squeeze your anus.

466
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,890
Pardon me?

467
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,850
Focus.

468
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,020
Do you see that target?

469
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,890
Yes, I do.

470
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,530
Do not let your arms sway
because you're tired.

471
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,760
Hold that position.

472
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,570
Aim the tip of the arrowhead
at the target.

473
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,200
And shoot.

474
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,610
Did you shoot with your eyes closed?

475
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,580
Do you really think so?

476
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,020
I did everything you said.

477
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,950
You must focus. Focus!

478
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,420
I am focusing.

479
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,050
Again.

480
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,830
Again.

481
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,140
Shoot.

482
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,940
Again, again.

483
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,010
Again.

484
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,960
This is the last one.

485
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,530
If you have a clear idea of what
you want to hit, you can do better.

486
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,240
What you are trying to hit
is not that tree.

487
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,640
Imagine about what you want to hit.

488
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,960
I hit it!

489
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,300
You missed the target,

490
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,870
but that is good.

491
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,770
Yes.

492
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,270
What did you imagine?

493
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,170
You.

494
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,880
How dare she!

495
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,430
Does it hurt?

496
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,530
Your hand

497
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,370
is as rough as your personality.

498
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,400
It is not your concern.

499
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,670
Take it.

500
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,910
What is it?

501
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,020
It is a salve.

502
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,720
If you put it on, your skin
will be as smooth as a baby's bottom.

503
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,090
What?

504
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,190
I'm sure if you apply it,
your hand will get better.

505
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,540
It smells wonderful.

506
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,840
Thank you, Lord Seong.

507
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,880
I thought about it,

508
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,520
and I am not going
on the secret mission with you.

509
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,790
But why?

510
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,390
Why won't you go?

511
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,190
I just don't want to.

512
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,370
Now that you have been promoted,
you have a bright future ahead of you.

513
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,540
So you want to stay in the government,
get involved in verbal disputes,

514
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,900
and enjoy a life of luxury?

515
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,540
But you've seen

516
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,140
how many people
outside Hanyang are suffering.

517
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,750
I meant even if I do
go on a secret mission,

518
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,520
I cannot go with you.

519
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,350
But you said you were
able to do your job because of me.

520
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,890
You said I deserve credit.

521
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,260
Yes, I did.

522
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,090
So why not?
Why can't I go with you?

523
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,900
I do not wish to put you
in that kind of danger again.

524
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
And...

525
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,840
Because I said so!

526
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,340
Lord Seong, why won't you finish
what you were saying?

527
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,550
Oh, this is why I am not going.

528
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,290
If I go with you, there will be
so many things for me to pay attention to.

529
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,560
Look what just happened.

530
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,290
You are making me very uncomfortable!

531
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,600
Lord Seong!

532
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,510
Lord Jang!

533
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,140
What is it?

534
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,840
Kang Inchung and his son
took their own lives.

535
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,680
What?

536
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,180
Lord Kim!

537
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,420
It is you.

538
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,750
Have you heard of the news
of the prisoners taking their own lives?

539
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,220
That is why we are here
having a discussion.

540
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,390
Have a seat.

541
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,320
We must run autopsies

542
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,490
to learn how they died.

543
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,960
The investigation has finished.

544
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,260
It's finished?

545
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,300
They took their own lives,
afraid of the royal interrogation.

546
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,940
So why the uproar?

547
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,840
They were bound to die.

548
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,170
What would you do if they were murdered?

549
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,710
Who would kill them?

550
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,280
The man who does not wish
for the truth to be revealed.

551
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,820
I will tell His Majesty
and check the bodies.

552
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,330
There is no use for that.

553
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,030
The bodies have been torn apart
and discarded.

554
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,900
If you want to see their heads,

555
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,370
go out to the market.

556
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,910
Lord Seong, I will do anything you ask.

557
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,210
I will practice my archery and...

558
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,050
What's wrong?

559
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,990
They are...

560
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,160
Something is wrong.

561
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,730
Dain, return home.

562
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,310
Will you let this be?

563
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,980
They were not the kind of men
who would take their own lives.

564
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,950
Enough.

565
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,480
The Chief State Councilor is behind this.

566
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,220
If you raise an issue,

567
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,690
he will take it as a personal attack.

568
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,060
You are no longer a royal agent.

569
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,030
Focus on your new position.

570
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,600
Royal agent.

571
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,800
Will becoming a royal agent change things?

572
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,080
I heard you are looking for a royal agent.

573
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,780
I am looking for a royal agent
to send to the south.

574
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,150
Who told you that?

575
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,550
Dain told me.

576
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,920
She said that His Majesty promised
an even higher position as a reward.

577
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,890
Dain said that?

578
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,560
What else did she say?

579
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,960
Did she tell you she will join you?

580
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:38,000
What? How did you know?

581
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,670
Dain took advantage of you.

582
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,370
What?

583
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:46,210
She has a personal goal
so turn her down.

584
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,240
What is that personal goal?

585
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,480
Do not concern yourself with that.

586
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,320
I will deal with Dain.

587
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,550
You may return home.

588
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,530
She tried to take advantage of me?

589
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,700
Assistant Advisor Seong.

590
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,880
I guess I should call you
Special Advisor Seong.

591
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,650
My father wishes to see you very much.

592
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,790
The Chief State Councilor?

593
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,460
Father, I brought
Special Advisor Seong Igyeom with me.

594
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,060
Enter.

595
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,700
Did you ask for me?

596
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,200
Sit down.

597
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,780
You've become a different man
after your secret mission.

598
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,390
I am pleased to say that I see ambition
in your eyes that wasn't there before.

599
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,720
Why have you summoned me?

600
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,020
I will tell you.

601
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,390
You may not know yet,

602
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,360
but a man needs great power
to accomplish great deeds.

603
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,730
Do you know where that power comes from?

604
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,670
I haven't given it much thought yet.

605
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,040
It comes from connections.

606
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,810
Join my side.

607
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,320
Miok, are you out there?

608
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,550
Yes, Father.

609
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,820
Come in.

610
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,260
Introduce yourself to him.

611
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,900
I am Kim Miok.

612
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:54,100
She is my youngest daughter.
She has reached the marriageable age,

613
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,440
but finding the right man for her
has not been easy.

614
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:58,970
Pardon me?

615
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:04,410
Becoming my son-in-law
will ensure a bright future for you.

616
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,980
Be all you can under my wing.

617
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:09,920
I...

618
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,590
Father, don't you think it's too sudden
for him to give you an answer?

619
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,360
Was I too haste?

620
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,630
I will give you two days.

621
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,500
There is no need to ponder over it
so decide quickly.

622
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,510
You're back.

623
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,150
Lord Seong.

624
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,980
Have you looked into it?

625
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,520
Why were they beheaded?

626
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,820
What is wrong?

627
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,160
I had forgotten
what kind of person you are.

628
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,200
You have a knack for mesmerizing people.

629
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:55,530
Pardon me?

630
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,870
Why did you say you wanted to join me
on a secret mission?

631
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,300
That is because I want to be of help.

632
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,440
You are a pathological liar.

633
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,540
I will not be going
on a secret mission with you.

634
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,780
Lord Seong, wait.

635
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,420
Actually...

636
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,320
Is anyone home?

637
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,720
Is this Lord Seong Igyeom's home?

638
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,090
It is. What brings you here?

639
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:28,960
What's happening?

640
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,700
Lady Miok.

641
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,970
What brings you here?

642
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,010
Did your father send you?

643
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,510
No. I wanted to pay you a visit.

644
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,720
I guess you must move first.

645
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,650
Do not worry.
My father will find a place for you.

646
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:53,660
But I...

647
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,560
Will you have me stand here?

648
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,730
Pardon my rudeness. Do come in.

649
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,580
Sit down.

650
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,690
What brings you here?

651
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:30,590
I wanted to see
what kind of a person you are.

652
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,490
Me?

653
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,430
As you can see, I am not much.

654
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,400
That is fine.

655
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,840
As you may have guessed,
there are many men who wish to marry me.

656
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,180
They came not for me but for my father.

657
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:54,920
But you were different.

658
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,990
How was I different?

659
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,550
When my father offered his own daughter,

660
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,560
you hesitated, without any signs of joy.

661
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,730
I did?

662
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,230
Take your time and decide.

663
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,200
But I wanted to tell you
that I have made up my mind.

664
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,720
What are you doing?

665
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,830
I shall go.

666
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,070
With marriage, swifter the better.

667
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,640
I shall wait for your answer.

668
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,250
Sir, marriage?

669
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,590
Who is she?

670
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,790
She is the Chief State Councilor's
youngest daughter,

671
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,490
so why would I refuse to marry her?

672
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:15,130
What? Just like that?

673
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,330
That's great news.

674
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,200
You got promoted,
and now you're getting married.

675
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,610
Congratulations.

676
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,020
Anyone can be a royal agent.

677
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,550
But I didn't need a royal agent.

678
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,920
I needed you.

679
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,340
Sir?

680
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:57,310
What is going on right now?

681
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,320
I couldn't have done it without you.

682
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,710
I have questions
about the prisoners' deaths.

683
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,950
They took their own lives,
and they were beheaded.

684
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,190
Who found the bodies?

685
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,620
The guard who was on duty.

686
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,020
I would like to speak to him.

687
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,530
He took a sick day.

688
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,530
Tell me where he lives.
I will go and visit him.

689
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,950
What are you staring at?

690
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,820
Doesn't he look familiar?

691
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,620
That is the leader of the gang of bandits
who is wanted.

692
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,690
A gang of bandits?

693
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:26,660
Yes, they only rob rich noblemen
in the countryside.

694
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,500
And they give out a portion
of the properties they steal

695
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,400
and win people's favor.

696
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,770
He is clever.

697
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,310
Yes, I thought so too.

698
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,740
Some even help them hide.

699
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,310
What is his name?

700
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,980
The noblemen call him Docheok.

701
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,280
Docheok?

702
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,850
Please excuse me.
I will visit the guard who was on duty.

703
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,690
Thank you.

704
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,860
Doesn't he look familiar?

705
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:05,430
You are thinking of the same man,
aren't you?

706
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,940
It's Ibeom.

707
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,990
While I am away in Hanyang,
prepare yourself.

708
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,600
What?

709
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,050
When I return after I pass the state exam,

710
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:14,640
I will persuade Father
and bring you with me to Hanyang.

711
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,840
You can study there
and take the state exam.

712
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,350
I wouldn't dare.

713
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,190
The world is changing.

714
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,160
There will come a day when anyone,
even if your mother is a peasant,

715
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,490
can have an opportunity to accomplish
anything they want.

716
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,260
Do you really think so?

717
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,300
Of course, it won't come on its own.

718
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,700
We must work toward it.

719
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,610
Don't you agree?

720
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,240
Lord Seong!

721
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,950
Ibeom, she is my woman.

722
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:09,260
Look after her for me until I return.

723
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,860
I will. Do not worry.

724
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:17,770
His age is over twenty,
and his height is six and a half feet.

725
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,240
He has dark eyebrows with sharp eyes.

726
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:26,880
He robbed noblemen
in Chungcheong and Jeolla Provinces.

727
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,650
Should you see him, report
to the government office with haste.

728
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:38,090
Sir, I think it is Lord Ibeom.

729
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,750
What should we do?

730
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,760
Make things right.

731
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:48,500
Robbery cannot change the world.

732
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,250
Lord Jang, Lord Seong Igyeom is here.

733
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:10,320
Let him in.

734
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,570
Is someone here?

735
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,640
Yes, a young man.

736
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:31,140
His name is Seong something.

737
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,880
Lord Seong Igyeom?

738
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,180
What brings you here at this hour?

739
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,020
I have something urgent
to discuss with you.

740
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,590
Okay, go ahead.

741
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:59,730
Appoint me as a royal agent again.

742
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,340
Royal agent?

743
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,780
What is the reason?

744
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,150
I heard His Majesty
is searching for a royal agent.

745
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,420
Wouldn't a man with experience
be better for the job than a novice?

746
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,650
That is true, but you have been promoted,

747
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,220
and you've won His Majesty's trust,

748
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,260
so why do you want to be a royal agent?

749
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,330
Have you heard of a man called Docheok?

750
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,440
Docheock? Of course I have.

751
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,000
He is wanted in the entire country.

752
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,510
He is my younger brother.

753
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,980
What? Younger brother?

754
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,780
How can he be your younger brother?

755
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,320
Is there anyone else who knows of this?

756
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,120
No.

757
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:58,630
You must never speak of it.

758
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:03,570
There will be those who will use
your flaw to destroy you.

759
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:07,240
Most of all, it is because
you have won His Majesty's trust.

760
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,970
I will not forget.

761
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,140
I will tell His Majesty
and set an appointment,

762
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,640
so you should return home for now.

763
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,110
Thank you, Lord Jang.

764
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,390
Sir, you are going to work already?

765
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,090
Did you sleep well last night?

766
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,730
Pack your things.

767
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,760
We will be gone for a long time
so check around the house too.

768
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,300
Yes. What?

769
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:16,340
Sir, it's not that, is it?

770
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,370
What do you mean?

771
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:22,010
You're not
going on a secret mission, are you?

772
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,450
What secret mission?

773
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,750
Secret mission.

774
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,150
I must have lost my mind.

775
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,520
We barely came back alive,
so what secret mission?

776
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,390
We can't do that.

777
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,100
You are correct.

778
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,570
So hurry up and get ready.

779
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:47,470
Sir!

780
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,510
What do you mean by that?

781
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,280
We are going on a secret mission.

782
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,240
If you want to go, go by yourself.
I can't go.

783
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,180
No, I won't.

784
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:56,950
What?

785
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,980
It's not a secret mission.
It's a death trap.

786
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,050
Would you like to try the death trap?

787
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:04,520
I'm not going!

788
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,290
You!

789
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,250
I'll see you later.

790
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:13,060
Do you still have
some unfinished business with me?

791
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:17,400
I came to negotiate with you.

792
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:19,670
Negotiate?

793
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:12,037
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

794
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:14,620
<i>Royal Secret Agent Seong Igyeom, go down
to Chungcheong and Jeolla Provinces</i>

795
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,460
<i>where robbers are raising havoc
and console the people.</i>

796
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,690
<i>What is it you want?</i>

797
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,430
<i>There is someone I must meet.</i>

798
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,960
<i>Take me with you.</i>

799
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,130
<i>I do not want her companionship.</i>

800
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,670
<i>I thought you wanted to bring her.</i>

801
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:25,930
<i>Maybe I wasn't myself.</i>

802
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:28,440
<i>Compared to you, I have much to learn.</i>

803
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,400
<i>Who's next?</i>

804
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,410
<i>Will you seduce a princess?</i>

805
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,010
<i>How dare you!</i>

806
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:34,240
<i>I received a report of a robbery
of a nobleman's house in Chungju.</i>

807
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,340
<i>Start your investigation there.</i>

808
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,680
<i>From those of noble blood to their slaves,
everyone was murdered.</i>

809
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,780
<i>The murderers are a gang of bandits!</i>

810
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:43,050
<i>Sir, do you really think Lord Ibeom
is responsible?</i>
