1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,500
"Tell the truth!"

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
A suspicious group of men
attacks the royal secret agent.

3
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:17,418
They murder all the policemen,
including the royal agent.

4
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:19,743
It has been a long while
since the royal agent was dispatched,

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,620
but there is no news, and the government
falls into a state of confusion.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,320
Meanwhile, here is our hero Seong Igyeom.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,790
He is gambling.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,990
He doesn't seem to have a serious bone
in his entire body,

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,160
and he and Honglang,
the top courtesan in the city,

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,790
got off on the wrong foot.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,500
She is actually Hong Dain, a female police
who is working undercover

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,760
as a courtesan.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,608
She is the Chief Royal Secretary's spy.

14
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:42,430
Meanwhile, the Chief Royal Secretary
searches for a new royal agent

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,239
under the king's secret order,
but he just can't find the right man

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,540
when he receives information
on Seong Igyeom.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,280
He has gone astray for some reason,

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,610
but Igyeom was exceptional enough
to win first place at the state exam,

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,450
so he picks him
to be the next royal agent.

20
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,790
He sends Dain, whom he can trust,
to join the royal agent's entourage.

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,350
That's how the female police Hong Dain,

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,620
Assistant Advisor Seong Igyeom

23
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,620
and his servant Park Chunsam

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,530
begin their somewhat unusual journey
as the royal agent's entourage.

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,959
Their first destination

26
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,800
is the town where the former royal agent
Park Cheolgyu disappeared.

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,600
The three begin each of their missions.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,070
Dain goes undercover as a courtesan
and gets information.

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,140
Chunsam goes around the town,
listening to people.

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,640
Igyeom hunts and kills the wild boar
that was hurting people

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,750
and builds friendship with the sheriffs.

32
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:29,050
Meanwhile, Dain visits Sawol,
the courtesan whose name was written

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,720
in the former royal agent's journal.

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,490
Without a word, she leads them
deep into the forest,

35
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,420
and she was about to tell them something

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,260
when an arrow that appears
out of nowhere hits her.

37
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,490
Sawol was pregnant, and she gives birth
with the last bit of energy

38
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,800
before passing away.

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,170
Igyeom visits the blacksmith
who made the arrows to find the killer,

40
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,717
but he had already been killed.

41
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:52,640
When Dain mentions Sawol's death
to the other courtesans,

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,550
they tell her she was pregnant
with the Little Sheriff's son.

43
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:00,080
The entourage begins to investigate
the place Sawol took them to earlier.

44
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,779
Soon, they find the former royal agent's
horse requisition tablet and his body.

45
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:06,690
Little Sheriff who helped attack
the royal agent, and get rid of his body

46
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,920
was about to kill the witness Sawol

47
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,427
but spared her life when she told him
that she was carrying his child.

48
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:14,860
The moment
all the puzzle pieces came together,

49
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,029
they are apprehended
by Little Sheriff and his men.

50
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:20,570
The men are sent
to a mine for hard labor,

51
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,570
and Dain is forced
to take them to the baby.

52
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,439
But the place she takes the sheriff
is not where the baby is

53
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,668
but where Assistant Royal Guard
Choi is. Dain escapes with his help,

54
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:34,480
and they leave to rescue the rest
of the entourage.

55
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,320
The place of hard labor

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,290
is an illegal gold mine
the government doesn't know about.

57
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,220
The innocent men
who were brought here by force

58
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,820
were being used to line someone's pockets

59
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,930
in a place where
there are no human rights.

60
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,460
Dain and Assistant Royal Guard Choi
arrive at the gold mine,

61
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,029
and they disguise themselves
as wine sellers and infiltrates the mine.

62
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:55,000
Moreover, they successfully feed them
wine laced with numbing drugs.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,870
They are about to escape
when Little Sheriff appears with his men.

64
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,240
At that moment, together with Dain
and Assistant Royal Guard Choi,

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,480
the men who were forced
to hard labor join them to fight.

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
And after they subdue
Little Sheriff and his men,

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,680
everyone returns to the town.

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,220
When Sheriff is about
to kill all the babies

69
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,847
to cover up all their crimes,

70
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,790
a loud voice is heard,
one everyone was waiting for.

71
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,860
"Here comes the royal secret agent."

72
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,830
He solves the case, earns the trust
of the King and gets a promotion,

73
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,200
but something nags at him.

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,811
It was the fact that he failed to uncover
the true owner of the gold mine.

75
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:35,140
So Igyeom goes
to interrogate the sheriffs,

76
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,580
but he hears
the shocking news of their suicides.

77
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,210
When he visits the man
who found the bodies,

78
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,680
he had also been killed by someone.

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,719
Leaving the uneasy feeling behind,
he takes his mind off the case

80
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,990
and gets ready to lead a normal life
as a high official.

81
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,442
But he is shocked
when he sees a wanted poster

82
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,790
of a gang of bandits that had been raising
havoc in Jeolla Province.

83
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,312
It was his younger brother Ibeom.

84
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:59,655
A few years ago, Igyeom went to Hanyang,
took the state exam,

85
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:02,459
placed at the top, and returned home.

86
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:03,714
But while he was away,

87
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,570
his beloved was imprisoned
for apparently seducing men in town,

88
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:12,407
and had fled with Ibeom,
who had fallen in love with her.

89
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:15,398
It was impossible to believe,
but when he caught up with them,

90
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,655
something even more tragic
was waiting for him.

91
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,483
Years passed without him knowing
whether or not they were alive,

92
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:25,420
but he learns that his brother had become
the leader of a gang of bandits.

93
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,363
Igyeom pays a visit
to the Chief Royal Secretary

94
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:31,754
and asks him to send him as
the royal secret agent to Jeolla Province.

95
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:36,163
Meanwhile, Dain hears that
the seonjeonkwan who witnessed

96
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,002
her parents' deaths is in Jeolla Province,

97
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,172
and the three of them
begin another journey.

98
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:43,854
Their first stop is a place where men
from all walks of life have gathered.

99
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,949
A gambling house.

100
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:48,814
But they run into the sheriff
who was demoted a long time ago

101
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,508
because of Dain's investigation.

102
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:57,014
They successfully get away,
but Igyeom spots his younger brother.

103
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,333
He goes after him
as if possessed by a ghost

104
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:01,730
when he also spots his beloved.

105
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,961
That is when he is apprehended
by the sheriff's men,

106
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:09,037
and when they are about to be killed
in a deserted forest,

107
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:09,921
arrows come flying.

108
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:12,257
The arrows were from the gang of bandits.

109
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:14,480
And Igyeom's younger brother Ibeom...

110
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:16,768
"It has been a long time, Brother."

111
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:17,943
Appears.

112
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,329
{\an8}EPISODE 7

113
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,900
So you are all in this together.

114
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,170
You will never leave this town alive.

115
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,070
I will kill every one of you
by tearing your limbs apart.

116
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,710
Just you wait.

117
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,190
We finally meet.

118
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,360
It's been a long time, Brother.

119
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,470
I did think that we would meet again
as long as we're both alive,

120
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,780
but I never expected for us
to meet this way.

121
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,750
Of course.

122
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,780
Ibeom.

123
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,180
Brother.

124
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,500
What are you doing?

125
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,800
What am I doing?

126
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,410
I understand, so please stop.

127
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,810
What are you doing? Huh?

128
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,780
I am doing what I must.

129
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,950
What you must?

130
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,180
Robbery is what you must do?

131
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,060
I heard that you've been robbing noblemen
throughout the country.

132
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,960
Those noblemen were not noble.

133
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,290
They were corrupt and made themselves rich
by imposing heavy taxes on people.

134
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,630
How does that justify robbing?

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,000
I only returned what was taken from them!

136
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,070
You once asked me

137
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,370
to change the world with you, did you not?

138
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,480
But then again,

139
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,210
you were wandering in the gambling house,

140
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,350
so you must have changed quite a bit.

141
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,180
That was...

142
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,290
Fine. Let me ask you one thing.

143
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,130
Was it you who killed Lord Lee
and his family?

144
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,530
No.

145
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,150
When we arrived, they were already dead.

146
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,220
That was not your doing?

147
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,550
I have never killed innocent people.

148
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,560
You would not believe anything I say.

149
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,389
You know me well.

150
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,130
It must be difficult to believe,

151
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,970
but we only take money.
We do not take people's lives.

152
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,899
And is that something to be proud of?
You are shameless.

153
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,610
I do not believe it was you.

154
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,120
If you had slaughtered those people,

155
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
you would be gone by now.

156
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,790
Did you target the gambling house
because you couldn't rob Lord Lee's house?

157
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,830
Why do you ask
when you do not believe me?

158
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,900
You...

159
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,240
Then make me believe you.

160
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,510
Why did you run then?

161
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,210
What happened?

162
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,610
Sunae!

163
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,890
Sunae!

164
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,090
- Sunae!
- Get them!

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,900
What is the use of dwelling in the past?

166
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,440
Just accept me as I am right now.

167
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,110
Does that mean the rumors are true?

168
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,610
Did you really

169
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,990
fall in love with Sunae,
abandon your position,

170
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,120
and flee with her?

171
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,160
Think what you want.

172
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,940
What happened to Sunae?

173
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,280
You must forget about her.

174
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,080
She passed away.

175
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,860
I will not blame you for that.

176
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,760
Come with me.

177
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,430
You expect me to go back
to being the noblemen's slave?

178
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,200
I refuse.

179
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,210
Do you think I would let you leave?

180
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,180
We have drifted too far apart.

181
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,890
We are leaving, so do not look for us.

182
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,230
Seong Ibeom!

183
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,670
You cannot change the world
with robbery.

184
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,270
Remember that.

185
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,290
Okay, okay.

186
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,760
Destiny brought us together,
so why not make introductions?

187
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,070
I am Park Chunsam.

188
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,570
A little smile won't kill you.

189
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,080
Doesn't frowning all day
hurt your forehead?

190
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,450
Let's not do this.
Take off your masks, so we can talk.

191
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,650
Boss.

192
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,160
Chunsam.

193
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,500
Yes, sir.

194
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,800
Look after my big brother.

195
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,660
What?

196
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, of course.

197
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,840
Come.

198
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,770
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,710
"Look after my big brother."

200
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,980
He thinks he's so great.

201
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,480
Lord Seong.

202
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,200
The magistrate must think
we are working with the bandits.

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
We should leave town for now.

204
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,770
Come.

205
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,520
Magistrate.

206
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,990
Where are they?

207
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,650
Who?

208
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,590
Those bandits!

209
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,860
Those thieves...

210
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,460
Magistrate,
you must try to calm down for now.

211
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,900
Forget it!

212
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Gather all the patrolmen.

213
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,870
Now!

214
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,400
Yes, sir.

215
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,940
The bandits are skilled in martial arts.

216
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,280
Apprehend them with any means.

217
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,520
And among them is a girl dressed as a man.

218
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,090
Make sure to bring her to me alive.

219
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,050
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,490
Lock the town down
and search for the bandits!

221
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,220
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

222
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,610
What is wrong?

223
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,650
Lord Seong, what are your plans?

224
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,450
I am postponing my appearance.

225
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,590
The bandits did not kill Lord Lee.

226
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,000
When they arrived,
the people were already dead.

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,430
Right?

228
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,170
I didn't think Lord Ibeom
was responsible...

229
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,940
Do you believe his words?

230
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,770
They are bandits.

231
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,040
You must not forget that.

232
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,210
I have thought it through
to reach that conclusion.

233
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,240
But...

234
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,810
Will you give me your trust?

235
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,520
I will.

236
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,990
Sir, what did you talk about
with Lord Ibeom?

237
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,830
He told me to put the past behind me.

238
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,400
Was that all?

239
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,930
He told me about Sunae.

240
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,200
He did?

241
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,670
Is Lady Sunae doing well?

242
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,240
Sunae is dead.

243
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,140
What?

244
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,350
Let us go to the temple.

245
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,020
We will spend the night there.

246
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,430
Come, Lady Dain.

247
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,840
What took you so long?

248
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,810
You must be hungry.

249
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,410
Sunae.

250
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,980
What is that smell?

251
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,310
I made chicken soup.

252
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,650
I knew it. It smells amazing.

253
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,990
Go ahead and eat.

254
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,790
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

255
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,320
Come with me.

256
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,830
Is something wrong?

257
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,200
No, nothing is wrong.

258
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,810
I heard people were murdered in town.

259
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,180
Did you go down to the town?

260
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,280
I went down to buy...

261
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,450
Have I not told you
to refrain from going out?

262
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,750
Go and pack your things.

263
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
Is there a problem?

264
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,190
The problem is...

265
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,430
Me for getting you involved in this.

266
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,260
Why would you say such a thing?

267
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,700
If you want to blame anyone,
blame me.

268
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,970
Isn't this life hard for you?

269
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,140
You are acting strange today.

270
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,080
Did something happen?

271
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,150
Go in and get some rest.

272
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,600
Seong Ibeom!

273
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,240
You cannot change the world
with robbery.

274
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,710
One cannot change the world
with robbery.

275
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,540
You haven't changed a bit, Brother.

276
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,710
Are you having trouble falling asleep?

277
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,450
My eyes just opened.

278
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,520
Why did you come out?

279
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,360
Here.

280
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,560
I did not have the chance
to give this back to you.

281
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,270
What's wrong?

282
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,510
Oh, my hand feels numb
because of what happened earlier.

283
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,680
Let me see.

284
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,080
It's nothing.

285
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
It is not nothing.

286
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,630
How does it feel?

287
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,000
Is it better?

288
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,180
Yes, it is much better.

289
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,280
Ouch.

290
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,290
Why? What's wrong now?

291
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,020
This hand hurts too.

292
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,890
What?

293
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,600
But you didn't use this hand.

294
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,630
Oh, my arm.

295
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,680
How's that?

296
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,450
It feels much lighter.

297
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,090
But earlier,

298
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,990
I bumped into something very hard,
and I cannot lift my arm.

299
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,200
Are you having fun?

300
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,870
Right. Thank you.

301
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,810
It's late.
You should try to get some sleep.

302
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,080
Dain.

303
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,190
Yes?

304
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,300
The man you are looking for,
are you in pain because of him?

305
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,470
I would have to meet him to know.

306
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,240
What will you do when you meet him?

307
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,680
I will ask for the truth.

308
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,410
Just as you did.

309
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,380
Aren't you afraid of that?

310
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,280
I am.

311
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,060
But unless I face the truth,

312
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,190
I will end up living my life
in bigger fear.

313
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,540
If I may be so bold,
do not try too hard.

314
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,850
The pain of losing the one you love
is not something you can overcome.

315
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,390
True.

316
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,600
If you would rather be alone, tell me.

317
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,600
Aren't you tired?

318
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,270
I am perfectly fine.

319
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,420
I must be mistaken.

320
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,500
Is this your way of offering comfort?

321
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,460
Is this really true?

322
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,560
Would I dare lie to you, Your Majesty?

323
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,100
Your Majesty,
the Chief Royal Secretary is here.

324
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,140
He may enter.

325
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,240
Have you called for me, Your Majesty?

326
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,380
The royal secret agent is living
in hedonism and has been seen gambling.

327
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,050
That is slander, Your Majesty.

328
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,890
Your Majesty, he was also seen
gambling with eunuchs while he was here,

329
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,560
causing moral corruption in the palace.

330
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,800
You know that very well, do you not?

331
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,970
Your Majesty, summon the royal
secret agent and punish him gravely.

332
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,350
Lord Jang.

333
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,720
You should have chosen wisely.

334
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,690
How could you put a morally corrupt man
in charge of His Majesty's work?

335
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,660
Why are you so concerned of a royal agent
a thousand miles away

336
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:42,400
when there are so many
morally corrupt officials in the palace?

337
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,600
I beg your pardon?

338
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,570
Did you really send a royal agent
to learn about why people are angry?

339
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,580
Are you sure there isn't
an ulterior motive?

340
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,060
Is there a reason why
you are so afraid of the royal agent?

341
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,790
What? Afraid?

342
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,860
Chief Royal Secretary Jang!

343
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,900
I will send a man to find out
if the appeal is true or not.

344
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,900
If the royal agent has committed a crime,
he will receive punishment,

345
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,910
but if it was a false accusation,
banjwayul will be applied.

346
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,650
How dare he.

347
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,320
Father, will you let him
get away with that?

348
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,750
It is not time.

349
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,150
We must deal with the royal agent first.

350
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,490
The royal agent?

351
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,260
Send a messenger to Seoyong.

352
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,260
He must arrive first.

353
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,360
Yes, Father.

354
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,510
Your Majesty, I am afraid to say

355
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,820
Chief State Councilor Kim
knew of the royal agent's moves

356
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,750
even before the seogye arrived.

357
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,050
I do not believe his every word.

358
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,260
However, since an appeal was submitted,
I must get to the bottom of it.

359
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,960
Please send a man to the royal agent.

360
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,330
Whom can I send?

361
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,220
Your Majesty, I shall
devote my energy into protecting you!

362
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,390
Do you know the royal agent?

363
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,590
Not at all, Your Majesty.

364
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,160
Then you would be even more impartial
when reporting on the royal agent.

365
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,110
Y-Your Majesty.

366
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,640
Am I wrong?

367
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,580
I am eternally grateful, Your Majesty!

368
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,620
Lord Jang.

369
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,930
I believe in you.

370
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,780
Your Majesty.

371
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,350
Over there.

372
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,300
What is going on?

373
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,200
They are being taken because of debts.

374
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,100
Debts?

375
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,250
Are they all?

376
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,620
They are only some on the list.

377
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,760
Where are the rest?

378
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,820
Well...

379
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,030
They either fled or took their own lives.

380
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,330
How could they be so irresponsible
after taking someone else's money?

381
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,940
Song Junam.

382
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,840
Yes? Yes, Magistrate.

383
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,450
You owe over 300 coins,
including interest.

384
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,750
How will you pay it back?

385
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,520
Well, Magistrate, we borrowed
the money from Lord Lee,

386
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,890
so why were we brought here?

387
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,130
So, now that Lord Lee is dead,

388
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,900
you were happy thinking that
you didn't have to pay your debt.

389
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,840
And now you're wondering why I am
asking you to pay your debt. Is that it?

390
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,700
No, that is not it.

391
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,310
You are an ingrate!

392
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,880
Maybe it wasn't the bandits.

393
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,680
Was it you who killed Lord Lee
to get out of your debt?

394
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,180
What? Sir.

395
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,380
Listen carefully.

396
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,050
Since Lord Lee's death,

397
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,090
his fortune has been reverted
to the government office.

398
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,620
Therefore, your debts have been reverted
to the government office.

399
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,020
That is unreasonable.

400
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,930
Unreasonable?

401
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,430
Did you expect your debt to suddenly
disappear with Lord Lee?

402
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,630
You are truly shameless.

403
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,000
Guards!

404
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,970
Punish this wicked man by flogging!

405
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,770
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

406
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,040
Sir.

407
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,940
Sir!

408
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,580
Flog him until he learns his lesson!

409
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,620
Sir!

410
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,190
Sir.

411
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,240
Lead us to your house.

412
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,650
You cannot return home by yourself.

413
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
Try to walk a little.

414
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,400
He's collecting the money
people owe the late Lord Lee?

415
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,300
That is unreasonable.

416
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,200
How much do you owe?

417
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,070
I owe about 300 coins.

418
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,440
What? 300 coins?

419
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,340
Is that all gambling debt?

420
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,220
I wasn't into gambling at first.

421
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:10,320
I had to borrow money
to pay the jabyeokse.

422
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:17,390
Then someone told me
of the gambling house,

423
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,460
saying I could pay my debt off at once.

424
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Afterwards, as you know,

425
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,770
I fell deeper and deeper into debt
because of gambling.

426
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,510
You fool!

427
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,140
Are you saying Lord Lee
continued to lend money

428
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,950
to men who got addicted to gambling?

429
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,950
Yes, he was happy to hear
that we were gambling.

430
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,720
Because the gambling house was his.

431
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,460
Men quickly became addicted to gambling.

432
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,530
And so did I.

433
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,670
Was there no policing?

434
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,370
The reward for turning a blind eye
must have been sweet.

435
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,680
Don't be surprised.

436
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,880
This is just the beginning.

437
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,650
Don't stay cooped in here.
Come and enjoy yourself.

438
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,220
That must be why the sheriff
frequented the gambling house.

439
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,620
He is extremely crafty.

440
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,930
He took over the gambling house
just after Lord Lee's death.

441
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,570
What if the opposite was true?

442
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,930
The opposite?

443
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:34,170
What if the sheriff, in order
to take ownership of the gambling house,

444
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,810
killed Lord Lee?

445
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,680
No.

446
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,880
When we arrived, they were already dead.

447
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,350
The bandits must have given him
the perfect cover for his crime.

448
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,020
I must visit Lord Lee's house.

449
00:31:51,261 --> 00:31:52,817
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

450
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,200
It is very quiet.

451
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,470
The whole family was massacred,
so people are afraid.

452
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,340
Sir, must you go inside?

453
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,710
Every crime scene holds clues.

454
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,950
There are no people around,
so it will be safer.

455
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,720
What? They are always quarreling,
but now they're perfect partners.

456
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,270
For you to come in like this...

457
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,840
Sir, something doesn't feel right.

458
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,910
Let us split up and look for clues.

459
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,850
Yes, Lord Seong.

460
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,810
Sir?

461
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,580
It doesn't feel right.

462
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,080
Sir!

463
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,509
Lord Seong.

464
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,940
Lord Seong, something doesn't fit.

465
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,279
This does not look like a place
where a massacre took place.

466
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,420
I felt that too. It is immaculately tidy.
It's as if someone cleaned it.

467
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,860
I found these in the shed.

468
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,589
Those are the strips.

469
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:12,160
Yes, they must have made these here.

470
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,299
To think a rich man like Lord Lee
making these strips...

471
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:18,700
Professional gamblers sometimes use
the patterns on the strips

472
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
to read the other players' hands.

473
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,370
He probably made them to prevent that.

474
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,170
Sir! Come here! Sir!

475
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,680
What is it?

476
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,550
Sir, try this kimchi.

477
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,020
It is delicious. There's rice too.

478
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,550
You...

479
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,320
Oh.

480
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,560
We got robbed, and I can't remember
the last time we ate.

481
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,000
We need to eat.

482
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,340
You are right.

483
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,800
We should eat.

484
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,110
I will cook the rice.

485
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,970
Stop.

486
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,580
Should you take other people's things?
Yes or no?

487
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,650
Get up.

488
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,050
Think of all the innocent people
who lost their lives here.

489
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,560
Yes, I guess you're right.

490
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,930
So let us remember the dead

491
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,430
as we eat this food.

492
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,470
Thank you!

493
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,300
Oh, darn it.

494
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,020
Sir, what about Lady Dain?

495
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,920
There is plenty of rice and kimchi,
so she will eat if she gets hungry.

496
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,220
Right?

497
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,090
Let us eat.

498
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,430
Delicious.

499
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,770
Why won't they ask me one more time?

500
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,870
Haven't they heard of
"The third time's the charm"?

501
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,540
"You haven't eaten all day
so have just one bite."

502
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,370
Is that so hard to say?

503
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,480
You heartless people.

504
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,550
You idiots!

505
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,590
Magistrate, we locked the town down

506
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,390
and searched every inch of the mountain,
but we could not find them.

507
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,860
They must have left the town.

508
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,190
Did you see it?

509
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,200
What? No, I haven't, but...

510
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Those thieves would not have left
empty-handed.

511
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,670
I will give you three days.

512
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,640
Find their traces at least.

513
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,340
Yes, Magistrate!

514
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,610
Boss!

515
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,510
This is what is left of the money
we gave to the poor.

516
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,650
Divide it among yourselves.

517
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,280
There is enough for you
to buy your own land.

518
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,720
What are you saying all of a sudden?

519
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,990
The time I told you about is today.

520
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,620
- Boss!
- Boss, you can't do this.

521
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,230
Boss, how could you do this
without talking to us first?

522
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,030
When we first got together,

523
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,240
we began this work in order to live
as decent human beings.

524
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,040
I think it is time to stop.

525
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Boss.

526
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,940
Thank you for everything.

527
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,910
Go and live normal lives
without having to be chased.

528
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,390
Sunae!

529
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,220
What is it?

530
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,860
Please stop him.

531
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,460
He wants to get out of this business.

532
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,500
Get out of this business?

533
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Is he going to quit robbing people?

534
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,870
Yes! This is all because
of what happened yesterday.

535
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,870
If he hadn't met his older brother...

536
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,240
Older brother?

537
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,080
We met Boss Ibeom's big brother.

538
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,520
Is it true?

539
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,360
What do you mean?

540
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,030
Did you meet Lord Igyeom
at the gambling house?

541
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,140
Yes, I did.

542
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,440
How...

543
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,110
He looked healthy.

544
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,910
Isn't that what you wanted to ask?

545
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,480
He asked about you.

546
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,980
What did you say?

547
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,390
I told him you died.

548
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,720
Why did you do that?

549
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,690
I thought that was the best thing
I could do for him.

550
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,500
So put him behind you.

551
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:00,450
Sir. Sir?

552
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,620
Be quiet. Go to sleep.

553
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,490
I am too scared to go to sleep.

554
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,390
Silly man. What is there to be scared of?

555
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,360
What is it?

556
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,770
Over there, over there.

557
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,100
Over there what? What?

558
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,640
The door shook.

559
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,170
I mean it.

560
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,310
That's because it's windy!

561
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,410
Rattle, rattle.

562
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,850
Let me get some sleep! Please!

563
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,090
Oh, I'm starving.

564
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,030
I hope they didn't eat everything.

565
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,460
Whoa.

566
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,570
Kimchi should be eaten by hand.

567
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,740
I hope they don't wake up.

568
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:12,920
What was that?

569
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,860
Why is this so hard?

570
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,870
Lord Seong?

571
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,440
Lord Seong?

572
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,210
Is that you, Chunsam?

573
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,450
What ghost? Geez.

574
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,660
Let me join you.

575
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,060
Oh, and you call yourself a man?

576
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,270
What was that sound?

577
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,070
Dain?

578
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,640
Why? What is it?

579
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,810
It's a ghost.

580
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,380
Dain!

581
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,650
A ghost.

582
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,040
You don't look like a vengeful ghost.

583
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,640
What are you?

584
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,550
Please help me.

585
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,510
Oh, my heart is still pounding.

586
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,720
Tell me. Who are you?

587
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,820
Why are you here?

588
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,960
Start talking.

589
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,230
Can you please give us some privacy?

590
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,040
Lord Seong, can I borrow
the horse requisition tablet?

591
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,640
My name is Hong Dain.

592
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,450
We are not robbers,

593
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,020
and we are not from the government office.

594
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,150
Would you look at this?

595
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,720
Do you know what this is?

596
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,660
It's a horse requisition tablet.

597
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,500
The man you saw earlier
is a royal secret agent.

598
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,300
And I am in his entourage.

599
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:58,180
We came to find out
why everyone in this house died.

600
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,420
What is your name?

601
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,960
I am Lee Aeran.

602
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,660
Aeran.

603
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,230
Why are you here?

604
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,240
I am a concubine's daughter of this house.

605
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,680
Then was Lord Lee your father?

606
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,810
So why are you here alone?

607
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,020
Can you tell me
what happened that night?

608
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,530
I didn't see anything.

609
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,010
Where is the girl?

610
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,480
She just fell asleep.

611
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,610
I see. Who killed everyone?

612
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,580
She was hiding
behind the rice chest the whole time,

613
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,150
so she did not see what was happening.

614
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,790
We have no way of proving
the sheriff's crimes.

615
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,760
But there was one thing she knew.

616
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,730
Every month on the day of the full moon,
a cart arrived at this house.

617
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,370
In the cart were chests filled with coins,

618
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,070
and Lord Lee divided them up
and sent them out.

619
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,700
Enough coins to fill a cart?

620
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,140
Was it the profit from the gambling house?

621
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,240
Tomorrow is the day of the full moon.

622
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,050
After sending the money out,
Lord Lee always wrote it down.

623
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,180
A ledger. He left a ledger.

624
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,050
If we find that, we'll know who received
money from the gambling house.

625
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,360
How do we know where the ledger is?

626
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,960
There is one place
even the bandits never got to rob.

627
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,730
The gambling house.

628
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,070
Chunsam, go to the gambling house
tomorrow and find the ledger.

629
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,200
Yes, but where is the ledger
in the gambling house?

630
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,700
There is a woman who manages that place.

631
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,370
She will know.

632
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:03,940
But am I going alone?

633
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,940
Yes.

634
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,240
I am going to steal the money
coming out of the gambling house.

635
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,440
I will come with you.

636
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,980
- No.
- What?

637
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,680
- Then I'll go with Chunsam.
- Yes.

638
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,950
- That is a worse idea.
- What?

639
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,180
You stay here.

640
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,250
Why are you leaving me out?

641
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,820
Don't you trust me?

642
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,330
It's not that.

643
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,590
It's too dangerous.

644
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,260
Come to think of it, I'm hurt.

645
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,230
Are you saying I'm okay
to be in danger?

646
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,600
You...

647
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,400
Do as I say!

648
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,540
Then let me go with you and keep watch.

649
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,940
You will need every help you can get.

650
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,760
Boss!

651
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,730
Sunae is missing.

652
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,540
Boss, did she say
she was leaving without us?

653
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,380
Don't worry about her.

654
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,680
You guys go.

655
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,380
I'm coming with you!

656
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,840
I will follow the cart.

657
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,200
You go and find the ledger.

658
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:42,670
Yes, sir.

659
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,540
You stay here.

660
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,740
Are you sure?

661
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,770
Don't worry.

662
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,240
Wait.

663
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,350
What if we miss each other?

664
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,250
Meet me back at Lord Lee's house.

665
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,820
Be careful.

666
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,380
Do you know where the gambling house is?

667
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,010
Gambling house?

668
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,150
I don't know.

669
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:39,030
If you want to flirt,
go to the courtesan house,

670
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,360
not here!

671
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,640
What's a big deal
about my groping your bottom?

672
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,040
What?

673
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,910
Take him and teach him a lesson,
so he will never come back here.

674
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:53,740
Yes, ma'am.

675
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,540
Maehyang! Maehyang!

676
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,350
Maehyang! Maehyang!

677
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,320
That filthy animal.

678
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,720
Look who's here.

679
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,390
I was wondering if you were dead or alive.

680
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,460
But how bold of you to come back here.

681
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,530
Why are you dressed like a man again?

682
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,700
You want to gamble?

683
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,040
I don't.

684
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,270
But I heard there is a ledger in there.

685
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,440
A ledger?

686
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,350
What about the ledger?

687
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,210
Oh.

688
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:32,850
Chunsam.

689
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,520
Let go of me!

690
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,360
You're a strong woman.

691
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,820
Oh, what are you doing?

692
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,060
What do you want?

693
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,900
Stay still!

694
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,330
What are you doing?

695
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,800
That's...

696
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,870
Watch her.

697
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,340
But Lord Igyeom said
you should keep watch.

698
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,770
I am much more familiar
with the inside.

699
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,840
Anyway, it won't take long.

700
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,780
Who are you people?

701
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,680
Do you think you could get away with this?

702
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,620
You will get hurt!

703
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,150
I may not look like much,
but I grew up in this business!

704
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,050
Chunsam,

705
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,360
shut her up. She's too loud.

706
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,120
Yes, Lady Dain.

707
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,690
Huh? Huh?

708
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,960
Why "Huh?" Oh, you're too loud.

709
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,590
What are you doing?

710
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,460
Hey! Hey!

711
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,290
Stop!

712
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,530
What happened?

713
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,160
I was attacked by the bandits.

714
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,800
They are robbing people over there.

715
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,830
Help us.

716
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:01,070
How many are there?

717
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,040
Two.

718
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,410
There is a big bounty on their heads.

719
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,540
This is my lucky day.

720
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,280
Come.

721
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,310
What about him?

722
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,620
It's not our problem if he lives or dies.

723
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,220
Watch the cart. We will get the bandits.

724
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,960
Where are the bandits?

725
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,620
What happened?

726
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,630
Magistrate?

727
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,500
Magistrate? Magistrate!

728
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,600
Be quiet.

729
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:17,340
Wait.

730
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,180
I'm going to the gambling house.

731
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:24,850
I'll pay you back.

732
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,550
Where is Maehyang?

733
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,560
I don't know.

734
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,290
Find her.

735
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,160
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

736
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,470
What?

737
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,280
You!

738
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,780
Don't come any closer.

739
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:31,710
You have gone mad.

740
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,850
Don't come any closer!

741
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,850
I will kill you.

742
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,320
Fire! Fire!

743
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,430
Fire! Fire!

744
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,600
Get out if you don't want
to burn to death!

745
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,270
- Fire!
- Fire!

746
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,040
Where? Where?

747
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,010
Get out! Get out!

748
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:01,980
Chunsam.

749
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,640
Lady Dain.

750
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,180
Come.

751
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,080
Okay.

752
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:16,160
Chunsam?

753
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,780
Sir, what brings you here?

754
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,350
How do you feel?

755
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,250
I can walk now.

756
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,390
Take this.

757
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,060
Get medicine with this.

758
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,930
But you don't have any money.

759
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,270
Don't worry.

760
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,300
I took this from the sheriff.

761
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,300
What?

762
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,940
So, the man the magistrate
put a bounty on was you?

763
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,780
Yes. Are you surprised?

764
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,510
Of course I am.

765
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,750
How much is the bounty?

766
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,420
I think it was 100 coins.

767
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,620
Only 100?

768
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,160
Once I give out that money I stole
to the people, my bounty will increase.

769
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,140
Kill Royal Agent Seong Igyeom
and cover it up.

770
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:45,610
Where is the royal agent?

771
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,080
Dain.

772
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:19,450
Chunsam.

773
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,750
Sir!

774
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,750
Sir. Sir.

775
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:27,690
How did it go?

776
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,090
Don't even get me started. Lady Dain...

777
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,790
I found it.

778
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,830
This is the ledger with the recordings
of all the transactions.

779
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,270
Take a look at this page.

780
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,200
Yes.

781
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,270
All the money is going to the sheriff.

782
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:45,140
It was only a part of the profit
until recently,

783
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,640
but now all of it goes to him.

784
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:50,010
I was right.

785
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:52,080
What happened to the money
from the gambling house?

786
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:53,950
I stole it and hid it.

787
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,120
You two are unbelievable.

788
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,090
But the money and the ledger

789
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,830
may not be enough to prove
that the sheriff killed Lord Lee.

790
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,330
I have a plan.

791
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:09,930
Let us prepare for our appearance.

792
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:11,070
Let us go, sir.

793
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:39,390
I think I am hallucinating.

794
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,430
What's wrong?

795
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,960
Sunae.

796
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,700
Right? But isn't she?

797
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,170
Isn't she Lady Sunae?

798
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,380
It has been too long, Lord Igyeom.

799
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:02,180
Is it really you?

800
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,290
Let me see you.

801
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,200
What took you so long?

802
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,800
I am sorry.

803
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,740
I thought you were dead.

804
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:32,810
Lord Ibeom did that to protect me.

805
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,190
Were you with Ibeom?

806
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,560
Yes.

807
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,170
Come with me.

808
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,700
I need to hear what happened to you.

809
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,710
Wait, sir.

810
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:03,950
Seong Igyeom!

811
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,750
Who are you?

812
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,280
I apologize for interrupting
such a tender moment.

813
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,390
You.

814
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,890
You look better
than when you were doing hard labor.

815
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,430
You are the man who pretended
to be the mine owner.

816
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:23,670
I was hoping to apprehend you,
and here you are.

817
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,200
How should I thank you?

818
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,670
I should've killed you then and there.

819
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:34,380
- Chunsam.
- Yes?

820
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,940
Take them and go to the temple.

821
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:36,880
Sir.

822
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,650
Now!

823
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,750
Yes, sir.

824
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,420
Get them.

825
01:01:24,465 --> 01:01:27,378
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

826
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,000
<i>Assault and rape.</i>

827
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,030
<i>He took his time to torture her to death.</i>

828
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,900
<i>It must be from a personal grudge.</i>

829
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,240
<i>It is getting more vicious.</i>

830
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,700
<i>You mean there are more victims?</i>

831
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,940
<i>Two women were found dead,</i>

832
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,680
<i>and one woman disappeared and is missing.</i>

833
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,680
<i>Are you even trying
to capture the culprit?</i>

834
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,780
<i>We are doing our best
to investigate, but...</i>

835
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,820
<i>While you were taking your time,
another woman got killed.</i>

836
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:51,490
<i>As a royal agent,
I will investigate this case myself.</i>
