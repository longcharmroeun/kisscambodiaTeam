1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,640
I am Hong Dain...

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,470
The scoundrel?

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,140
What? Scoundrel?

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,510
Wait, you're...

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,580
Honglang?

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,390
You're the royal secret agent?

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,190
You... You!

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,060
There she is. Get her!

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,100
Who are they?

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,230
Run!

11
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:42,345
EPISODE 2

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,340
Sir, why are we running?

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,440
I don't know!

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,020
This way, this way!

15
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,940
Who are they?

16
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:26,150
Well...

17
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,080
By the way, are you really
the royal secret agent?

18
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,320
Here, look. Satisfied?

19
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,260
I was expecting someone grand
but I guess not.

20
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,060
What?

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,600
Has the Chief Royal Secretary really send
a courtesan to accompany me?

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,800
A courtesan? I'm a female police.

23
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,810
A female police?

24
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,280
Not a hostess?

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,510
A hostess?

26
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,210
Are you trying to cross the line?

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,620
Then explain to me

28
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,720
why you are being chased in daylight.

29
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,420
They must have figured out what I am.

30
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,620
What did you do?

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,660
My job was to keep an eye
on the Chief State Councilor.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,700
You could be executed for that!

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,840
We lost her.

34
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,310
Let us return to the courtesan house.

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
I must apprehend the Head Courtesan.

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,980
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,180
Let me properly introduce myself to you.

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,390
I am Hong Dain, here to join
your entourage.

39
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,690
It was the Chief Royal Secretary's order.

40
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,740
You will need a woman to carry out
your secret mission,

41
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,310
so I am sending a female police.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,179
Have her infiltrate the courtesan house
and find the girl the agent wanted to see.

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,020
She's in possession of key evidence.

44
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,150
So...

45
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,890
He sent you?

46
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,020
That is correct.

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,800
Completing the mission aside,

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,970
I am unsure of a woman being able
to survive the journey to our destination.

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,140
Let me tell you in advance.

50
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,770
If you fall behind
or hinder the progress of my journey,

51
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,940
I will leave you behind.

52
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,910
And on top of that, from now on,
I will be giving orders.

53
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,980
Do you understand?

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,320
Yes, sir. I will not forget.

55
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,140
After all we have done,
she is still not talking.

56
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,740
I don't think she knows anything.

57
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,940
Wake her.

58
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,550
Please don't kill me.

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,320
Please let me go, my lord.

60
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,860
Let me ask you one last time.

61
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,830
Who put you up to this?

62
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,230
What do you mean?

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,770
Please let me go.

64
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,640
Please let me go, my lord.

65
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,080
Father.

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,350
Make sure this does not leak
and get rid of any evidence.

67
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,980
Yes, Father.

68
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,800
What's that?
What is that over there?

69
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,690
Sir!

70
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,560
This is so nice and cool.
Come and join me.

71
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,509
You are acting like a fool.

72
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,509
A gentleman must always mind his manners.

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,080
Let us go before the sun goes down.

74
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,090
We should look for a place
to spend the night around here.

75
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,890
Sir, here's a deserted house.

76
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,390
It looks haunted.

77
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,400
Take the master bedroom.

78
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,030
I will take the small one.

79
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,670
I said I will give the orders!

80
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,110
You take the small room.
We will take the master bedroom.

81
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,240
That's what she just said.

82
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,050
Anyway, goodnight.

83
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,180
Goodnight, Lady Dain.

84
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,430
Ma'am... Ma'am...

85
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,040
Unbelievable.

86
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,280
Oh!

87
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,220
What do I do?

88
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,820
What is he doing?

89
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,270
Oh!

90
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,020
Oh, how refreshing!

91
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh, whatever. I should leave.

92
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,490
Wait, you... You!

93
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,560
Sir.

94
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,610
I will leave first
so please close your eyes.

95
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,040
S-Sure.

96
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,810
Close them tightly.

97
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,920
If you open them, I will kill you.

98
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,110
Are you all right?

99
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,220
You couldn't have been born
a female police.

100
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,660
How did you become one?

101
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,590
It was not my choice.

102
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,560
Then?

103
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,870
The Chief Royal Secretary
made me into a female police.

104
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,200
How do you know him in the first place?

105
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,670
He took me in.

106
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,140
And saved my life.

107
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,680
Is there a story behind that?

108
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,980
Father!

109
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,950
I will return soon.

110
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,560
Give me a few days.

111
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,290
Mother...

112
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,710
It has been a long time,
so I don't remember very well.

113
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,750
Our clothes are dry so let us go back now.

114
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,820
He must have sent you
because he trusts you,

115
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,950
but I don't know anything about you.

116
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,920
Is even Hong Dain your real name?

117
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,230
Is that important?

118
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,800
I need to know who you are
to be able to trust you.

119
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,470
Just because you know someone
doesn't mean you can trust them.

120
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,510
By the looks of how hesitant you are,

121
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,080
I guess you have something to hide.

122
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,120
That night when you were
at the courtesan house,

123
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,020
you didn't look that honest either.

124
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,160
It is wrong to judge a man
by his appearance.

125
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,780
You don't know
what kind of a man I am on the inside,

126
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,800
so I forgive you.

127
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,210
I want to avenge the death of my parents
for they were innocent.

128
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,870
The late king's nephew Lee Han,
Prince Hwiyeong,

129
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:42,250
took his own life while being transported
to Hanyang under the royal order

130
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,320
for the charge of conspiring
to commit treason.

131
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,040
Only a single line of record
for a major incident

132
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,970
such as Prince Hwiyeong's death...

133
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,600
I heard someone was killed by the beast
after going to get firewood.

134
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,140
I am miserable because it comes down

135
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,740
to the village every night to eat
and destroy all my crops.

136
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,140
We barely have enough to pay taxes
to the government office,

137
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,510
and now we must deal with a wild boar.

138
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,550
Isn't that wild boar being just like
the Big Sheriff and the Little Sheriff?

139
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,460
Oh, stop it. What if someone hears you?

140
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,590
Let's go.

141
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,870
A wild boar that kills people...

142
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,440
Let us visit the government office.

143
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,370
Yes, sir.

144
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,080
This is the place

145
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,220
the Special Advisor wrote about
in his journal.

146
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,050
I don't see anything special though.

147
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,520
We will find out once we investigate.

148
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,850
Make way!

149
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,540
Pardon me, who is that man?

150
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Don't you know the Little Sheriff?

151
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,510
A sheriff is a sheriff,
so what's a little sheriff?

152
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,180
How frustrating.

153
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,850
He is the son of the Sheriff.

154
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,190
In this town, the Little Sheriff is king.
Do you understand?

155
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,440
Sir, what should we do?

156
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,640
First...

157
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,040
Let us eat.

158
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,580
Yes, sir.

159
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,490
Sir, what should we do first?

160
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,320
Let's arrest all the corrupt officials.

161
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,189
Silly man.

162
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,260
Making such a fuss will lead to mistakes,
don't you know?

163
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,230
Chunsam, meet with the villagers
and find out how they feel.

164
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,669
There must be problems.

165
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:47,730
Yes, sir.

166
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,640
Honglang...

167
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,010
I mean, Dain, go to the courtesan house
and find the girl named Sawol

168
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,340
and find out where the Royal Agent is.

169
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,240
Yes, sir.

170
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,380
Then what will you be doing?

171
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,720
I am...

172
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,850
Thinking of making a friend.

173
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,730
Enjoy your stay.

174
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,540
Oh.

175
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,910
Oh, nice.

176
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,840
I will be able to sleep
comfortably tonight.

177
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,110
Oh, how nice.

178
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,890
Why are you guys standing around
so awkwardly?

179
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,620
Are you uncomfortable?

180
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,960
No.

181
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,730
How dare you lie down like that?
Where are your manners?

182
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,300
Oh! I can sleep out in the dog house,

183
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,430
so you two can sleep in comfort here.

184
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,870
- Chunsam!
- Chunsam!

185
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,770
What is it? What?

186
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,380
We have a full day tomorrow,

187
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,980
so rest here in comfort.

188
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,110
What he said.

189
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,630
Sunae!

190
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,700
Sunae...

191
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,350
What is it?

192
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,150
What is going on?

193
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,750
Oh, he is dreaming.

194
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,720
He does that sometimes
so don't worry about it.

195
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,130
He was calling for someone.

196
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,790
Sun, Sunae?

197
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,800
It's Sunae. A long time ago...

198
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
It's better if you don't know.

199
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,000
And pretend not to know anything.

200
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,050
He is calling for a woman
even in his dream.

201
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,680
I am in disbelief.

202
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,190
Oh, we are losing daylight.

203
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,500
You don't know anything about women.

204
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,110
It takes women a long time to do anything.

205
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,470
So men must be patient.

206
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,520
How much longer...

207
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Is that really Lady Dain?

208
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,900
She's like a fairy.

209
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,400
Don't you agree, sir?

210
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,310
Don't be silly!
Not everyone in a dress is a fairy!

211
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,910
We cannot waste anymore time
so hurry up.

212
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,510
Dain, follow me.

213
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,380
Yes, sir.

214
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,120
I can't stand him.

215
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,790
What do you think?
She's a true fairy, no?

216
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,490
She can dance beautifully,

217
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,360
and she plays the gayageum
better than Hwang Jini.

218
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,660
Everyone can do that.

219
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,210
Twirl around.

220
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,350
Say "ah."

221
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,350
Ah.

222
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,220
My goodness.

223
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,360
Not bad.

224
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,870
So, how much do you want?

225
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,080
Two thousand coins.

226
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,710
Two thousand?

227
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,680
Two hundred, two hundred.

228
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,820
Is that a joke?

229
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,850
You could buy this courtesan house
for two thousand coins.

230
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,890
Are you mad?

231
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,900
I didn't say two thousand.
I said two hundred. Hundred.

232
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,030
You said two thousand.

233
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,900
Here, two hundred coins.

234
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,640
I am being generous.

235
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,780
You are not as expensive as I thought.

236
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,050
Take her.

237
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,950
Come with me.

238
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,690
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,930
Oh no.

240
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,200
Sorry.

241
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,440
How rude.

242
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,610
You look over there. You, there.

243
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,950
Sir.

244
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,110
Keep looking.

245
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,990
Please show mercy
for the sake of my children.

246
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,290
My mercy has limits.

247
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,120
Do you know how much tax you owe?

248
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,560
Sir, my husband's 49th day
memorial rite has just finished.

249
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,070
So how can you charge military tax
to a dead man?

250
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,370
Your husband is not the only one
on the military roster.

251
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,170
What?

252
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,910
My little boys must serve in the military?

253
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,650
What?

254
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,290
They have nothing,
not even a bowl of rice.

255
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,150
What?

256
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,350
Damn it.

257
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,860
Fine. I will give you one more day.

258
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,760
Unless you pay,

259
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,060
I will sell your children!

260
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,230
No, sir, not my children,

261
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,630
please, sir, have mercy.

262
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,840
Stop it!

263
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,500
- Mom!
- Mom!

264
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,710
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,480
Mom.

266
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,280
That bastard.

267
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,080
Mom.

268
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,560
She is new. Her name is...

269
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,330
What was it?

270
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,670
I am Honglang.

271
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,850
All good?

272
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,540
Now play nice.

273
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,940
Honglang?
Your name is so tasteless.

274
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,250
Hey, come here.

275
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,190
Geez, it's the same everywhere.

276
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,730
Why? Are you the boss here?

277
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,100
How dare you!

278
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,140
How did you survive with a face like that?

279
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,210
You should clean the toilet for now.

280
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,390
Then I should start with your hole.

281
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,660
What did you eat today?

282
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,860
What? You little...

283
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,580
I'm going hunting.
Do you have anything nice?

284
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,980
What are you planning on hunting?

285
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,190
I am planning on hunting a wild boar.

286
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,600
You don't look like a hunter.

287
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,800
Do not judge a man by his appearance.

288
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,050
This is steel tip arrow I made myself.

289
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,820
Steel tip arrow?

290
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,460
I make these only for special orders,

291
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,730
but you could kill a wild boar
with one strike with this.

292
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,840
Lift them up.

293
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Hey, lift them up higher.

294
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,780
Lift them up high.

295
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,910
Seriously.

296
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,290
Hey, you.

297
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,460
What?

298
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,860
Is there a girl named Sawol here?

299
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,100
Sawol? Why do you want her?

300
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,930
Just answer me.

301
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,800
Where is Sawol?

302
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,570
Sawol cannot work right now.

303
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,370
Why not?

304
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,780
After she got pregnant,
she has been mentally unstable.

305
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,350
Pregnant?

306
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,420
Who are you?

307
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,660
Are you Sawol?

308
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,380
Didn't you meet a royal secret agent?

309
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,290
Get out!

310
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,530
Sir.

311
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,430
Oh, sir.

312
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,110
Sir, where are you going?

313
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,540
You will see.

314
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,740
What are you going to use the bow for?

315
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,680
And what is this hoe for?

316
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,310
Nothing beats a gift
when trying to make a friend.

317
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,050
Wait.

318
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,860
Dig a hole over there
big enough for a man to lie down.

319
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,690
What?

320
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,960
What are you planning on burying there?

321
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,900
And why are we here?

322
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,470
I came to bury you.

323
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,240
What?

324
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
I heard Kim Manhui and his minions
were chasing after you.

325
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,730
Yes.

326
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,270
Did they discover your identity?

327
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,290
They saw our faces,

328
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,370
but they didn't seem
to know much about us.

329
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,940
That concerns me.

330
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,810
I will let the Chief Royal Secretary know,

331
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,410
so you keep a close eye
on the Royal Agent

332
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,020
and report everything.

333
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,180
He is unpredictable.

334
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,720
I agree.

335
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,760
I think I've met every type
of nobleman out there,

336
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,320
but he is unlike any other.

337
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,930
Why? Did something happen?

338
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,170
He looks sane one moment
but mad the next,

339
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,640
and he looks mad one moment
but sane the next.

340
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,610
I cannot read him.

341
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,510
I see.

342
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:18,517
As the poem goes, the bright moon
is filling the empty mountains.

343
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,840


344
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:22,777
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

345
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,580
You seem very relaxed.

346
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,520
This is no time to sit around.

347
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,290
You should go and see for yourself.

348
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,960
You have no idea how much suffering
these people are experiencing

349
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,060
because the officials are taxing
everyone, even children and the dead.

350
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,730
You really have no idea.

351
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,030
Forget it.

352
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,000
Where are you going?

353
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,940
I'm going to pee.

354
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,970
I'm going.

355
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,940
It is sensitive to smell and sound

356
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,440
so make sure you go far away.

357
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,080
Sure, sure, Royal Agent, sir.

358
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,940
Geez, who goes hunting at night?

359
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,850
Help! Help!

360
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,220
Help Chunsam!

361
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,020
It's a wild boar!

362
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,620
No!

363
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,790
Help!

364
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,840
Sir, the boar, the boar!
The wild boar!

365
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,340
Sir! Help Chunsam! Help!

366
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,460
Get out of my way.

367
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,590
Get out of my way!

368
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,850
Whoa, I thought I was dead.

369
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,480
This one is enormous.

370
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,580
What are you going to do with this?

371
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,320
I told you. It's a gift.

372
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,090
What?

373
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,440
So this is the one that was causing
a havoc in my town?

374
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,010
So, who caught this?

375
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,820
Sir, it is he.

376
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,320
I am Seong Igyeom.

377
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,260
Oh, so you caught
this monster by yourself?

378
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:10,230
By the looks of it,
you are not from this town, are you?

379
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,720
I was passing through

380
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,800
when I heard of
the mountain boar harming people,

381
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,109
and I wanted to be of help.

382
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,810
That is truly praiseworthy.

383
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,310
I caught it, I did.

384
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,680
And what were you doing all this time?

385
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,950
You went through much trouble
so relax and enjoy yourself today.

386
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,060
I am honored, thank you.

387
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,230
Keep this hidden.

388
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,270
The horse requisition tablet?

389
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,440
Why are you giving this to me?

390
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,210
I don't want my identity to be discovered.

391
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,010
The Royal Agent was investigating
the father and son duo.

392
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,640
They must be hiding something.

393
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,780
I am going to find out what that is.

394
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,810
Yes, sir.

395
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,890
Do you have a plan?

396
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,420
You must enter the tiger's lair
to catch a tiger.

397
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,930
A true royal agent
does not fear for his life.

398
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,060
I am touched.

399
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,940
Please enjoy the feast.

400
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,270
Thank you.

401
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,610
Sir!

402
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,930
You must be new.
Come and sit next to me.

403
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,300
You serve him.

404
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,780
I am Honglang.

405
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,550
Let me pour you a drink.

406
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,120
Thank you.

407
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,550
What are you doing here?

408
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,920
- I...
- Here.

409
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,520
Let us drink.

410
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,330
Of course.

411
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,070
Bring more wine!

412
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,580
Yes, sir.

413
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,440
Stay.

414
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,880
Let me pour you a drink.

415
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,620
Oh, I must be drunk.
My hands are slippery.

416
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,660
I do apologize.

417
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,600
It is fine.

418
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,300
Bring me water to clean my clothes.

419
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,970
We will bring new food.

420
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,010
Come.

421
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,040
But I should help clean...

422
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,080
I apologize.

423
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,920
What are you doing?

424
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,660
Wasn't it obvious?
I was teaching the pervert a lesson.

425
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,290
Are you here to enjoy yourself?

426
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,330
Oh, do not misunderstand.

427
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,600
I am here on official business.

428
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,030
Official business?

429
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,300
You couldn't stop smiling,
sitting between two courtesans.

430
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,700
Why didn't you dance
like the last time?

431
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,670
I was acting.

432
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,670
Couldn't you tell?

433
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,240
No, your acting was so natural
that I couldn't tell it was acting.

434
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,080
Do you think anyone can be a royal agent?

435
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,130
Enjoy.

436
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,830
Father!

437
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,340
No, I'm not your father.

438
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,470
Who are you?

439
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,010
Oh, good boy.

440
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,710
What is this for?

441
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,980
It's nothing much...

442
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,850
Did you do hard labor
with my late husband?

443
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,590
Hard labor?

444
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,990
No one has returned alive from there,

445
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,130
but you look perfectly well.

446
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,760
Let me see.

447
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,970
Did you put together something
for me to collect?

448
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,110
Not yet.

449
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,440
Please give me a few more days.

450
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,080
I have given you many chances!

451
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,010
Hey, grab the boys.

452
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,950
Yes, sir.

453
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,250
No! Please!

454
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,450
Who are you?

455
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,520
This is too much.

456
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,620
This is robbery!

457
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,760
How dare you call
legitimate tax collecting robbery?

458
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,790
What? Legitimate?

459
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,200
Oh, that is a pile of dung.

460
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,660
Dung?

461
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,960
Apprehend him!

462
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,400
Yes, sir.

463
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,330
Hey, hey, hey, apprehend whom? Let go.

464
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,200
Let go of me!

465
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,770
Goodness, no.

466
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,350
Horse requisition tablet?

467
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,810
A horse requisition tablet!

468
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,220
That's a horse requisition tablet!

469
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,620
No, no, this isn't
a horse requisition tablet.

470
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,990
I am sorry.

471
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,550
Here comes the royal secret agent!

472
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,720
Oh!

473
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,690
Please spare us!

474
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,700
Instead of trying to help
this poor family,

475
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,470
what do you think you're doing?

476
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,270
We are just following orders.

477
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,880
What? Following orders?

478
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,580
You treacherous little men!

479
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,980
I will give you one last chance,

480
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,020
so do not show your faces here!

481
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,420
Do you understand?

482
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,550
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

483
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,460
If I hear rumors of a royal secret agent
appearing in this town,

484
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,190
I will find you

485
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,900
and tear your limbs apart.

486
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,300
Have I made myself clear?

487
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,770
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

488
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,270
We will never forget!

489
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,470
Then get out of here!

490
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,940
Yes, sir, yes.

491
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,270
Go!

492
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:54,870
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

493
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,310
Leave!

494
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,810
Get out of here!

495
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,990
Hello, hello.

496
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,230
So...

497
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,030
I will go and pee.

498
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,910
You are very reckless.

499
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,310
You did this
to become friends with that man?

500
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,380
Did you find Sawol?

501
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,490
Well, I did find her,

502
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,060
but there is a problem.

503
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,260
What do you mean?

504
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,900
She is pregnant, and she looked
as if she is out of her mind.

505
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,970
Did she remember
meeting the Royal Agent?

506
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,100
Bringing that up made her
raise her guard against me.

507
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,440
Maybe...

508
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,420
You seemed to had too much to drink,

509
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,980
so why don't we call it a day?

510
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,290
Who are you?

511
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,630
You seem very drunk. Let us go.

512
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,400
You caught a wild boar
while passing through?

513
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,110
Did you honest think I would believe that?

514
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,380
I saw a mark, and I could not let it go.

515
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,690
You are very full of yourself.

516
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,120
I like you.

517
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,660
Come with me.

518
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,160
I want to take you somewhere.

519
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,430
Where is that?

520
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,300
I will show you something interesting.

521
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,910
Sure.

522
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,850
Don't go.

523
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,980
I'm getting a bad feeling.

524
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,450
Are you concerned about me?

525
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,490
This isn't out of concern.

526
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,490
I fear you might make a mess of things.

527
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,900
Nothing can be done without taking risks.

528
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,300
That goes for both you and me.

529
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:52,120
Sir!

530
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,490
E-Enter.

531
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,860
We are in big trouble, sir.

532
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,600
A royal agent, a royal secret agent
is here.

533
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,570
What? A royal secret agent?

534
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,340
Are you certain?

535
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,870
I am.

536
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,510
I saw the horse requisition tablet
with my own two eyes.

537
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,810
And his manner of speaking and behavior...

538
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,080
He is a royal secret agent for sure.

539
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,720
Bring me my wagon.

540
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,750
No, no, no! Get my horse ready!

541
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,450
Yes, sir.

542
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,260
Are there animals to hunt here?

543
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,530
Just wait.

544
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,640
Who is he?

545
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:53,780
He attacked a nobleman to steal food.

546
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,320
Why should I let a beast of a man live?

547
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,750
So what are you going to do?

548
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,020
Do you know the best kind of hunting?

549
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,020
It is human hunting.

550
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,830
Let him go.

551
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,870
Do you know who I am?

552
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:25,610
Punishment for kangsangjoe is death,

553
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:27,680
KANGSANGJOE: CRIME OF DISOBEYING
THE MORAL CODE DESIGNATED BY CONFUCIANISM

554
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,250
but I will show you mercy.

555
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,120
If you get to escape past that target,

556
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,590
you are free.

557
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,390
Go.

558
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,600
Run!

559
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,980
It's your turn now.

560
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,920
Hurry. He will escape.

561
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,220
Do you want to let him go?

562
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:15,760
Hurry.

563
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,520
You are fantastic, sir.

564
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,260
We almost missed him.

565
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,600
Why? Does that peasant scare you
more than a wild boar?

566
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,140
Get rid of him.

567
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,970
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,350
Tell your captain that I am here.

569
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:22,130
The government has sent
another royal secret agent.

570
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,830
What should I do?

571
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,470
Whoever gave the order,

572
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,670
they are moving faster
than I had anticipated.

573
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,600
Royal secret agents.

574
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,240
They are pesky little things,
like mosquitoes.

575
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,010
Do not mind him and make him join us.

576
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,250
You mean bribe him?

577
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,620
What if there is a problem?

578
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,220
What else could we do?

579
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,190
Then there will be bloodshed.

580
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,460
What is the progress on recruiting
construction laborers?

581
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,430
Well, finding manpower is...

582
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,570
What is your job?

583
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,880
If you cannot find a few laborers,

584
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,980
how could I trust you to join me
in accomplishing my great work?

585
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,850
Give me a little more time.

586
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:23,250
I will send people to you.

587
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:31,830
Are you in there?

588
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,100
Who is it?

589
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,870
I want to talk to you for a brief moment.

590
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,470
Don't do this. I don't know anything.

591
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,910
It's about your little brother Dongsu.

592
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:45,840
His name is Dongsu, isn't it?

593
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:52,820
Dongsu? Do you know my little brother?

594
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,420
Yes, I read the journal
the Royal Agent kept.

595
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,320
Why was your little brother taken?

596
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,660
It was them.

597
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,130
They will kill everyone!

598
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,430
Whom do you mean?

599
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,700
Who are they going to kill?

600
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,000
Save my brother! He is innocent.

601
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,540
Okay. Calm down.

602
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,380
We can help you.

603
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,080
The Royal Agent has sent me.

604
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,150
Royal agent?

605
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:26,720
A new royal secret agent arrived in town.

606
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,350
He is staying at the tavern
so come with me.

607
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:42,930
Come.

608
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,500
What made you so scared?

609
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,430
What's wrong? What happened?

610
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,400
Bring me wine!

611
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,060
I'm sorry.

612
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,570
But we really need you.

613
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:47,360
Sawol,

614
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,130
this is the journal
Lord Park Cheolgyu has left.

615
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,430
I hope you read it.

616
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,450
You're back.

617
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,820
Where is Jonggil?

618
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,990
At the courtesan house.

619
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,360
What? Bring him this instant!

620
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,230
You had too much to drink.

621
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,900
Is something on your mind?

622
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,840
There is no need for your concern.

623
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:36,910
Pour me a drink.

624
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,150
But where is the man who left with you?

625
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:50,790
Why did you come back alone?

626
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,690
For a lowly courtesan,
you ask too many questions.

627
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,100
Sir, there is a problem.

628
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,670
You must return to the government office.

629
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,810
What is it?

630
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:13,540
Well, I cannot tell you here.

631
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,510
Leave.

632
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,470
It's a royal secret agent.

633
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:38,740
A royal secret agent?

634
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,870
Well, I mean...

635
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,240
There is a royal secret agent in town.

636
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,580
How do you know?

637
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,740
I met him.

638
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,080
That is nonsense.

639
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,650
He is dead.

640
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,850
He is dead?

641
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:59,220
Yes, he is already dead.

642
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,460
But I met him this afternoon.

643
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,060
And he died already?

644
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,700
What?

645
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:17,940
Father.

646
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,880
Enter.

647
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,520
There is a royal agent in town.

648
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,090
Could the courtesan whose life you spared

649
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,730
be responsible for this?

650
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,500
You should have killed her.

651
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,970
Lord Seong! Chunsam!

652
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,170
Lord Seong!

653
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:23,740
Lord Seong...

654
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,550
Lady Dain, is something wrong?

655
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,420
Chunsam, Lord Seong is...

656
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,460
Yes?

657
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,590
Lord Seong is...

658
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,520
Yes?

659
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:49,670
Lord Seong!

660
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:53,500
What is it?

661
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,240
Are you all right?

662
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,470
I thought you were dead.

663
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,810
Me? Why would I die?

664
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,750
Kang Jonggil said
the royal secret agent was dead.

665
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,850
What?

666
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,780
So I thought you died.

667
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,560
The royal secret agent is dead?

668
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,260
So if he didn't mean you,

669
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,330
he must have meant the Special Advisor.

670
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,130
It is too early to say.
We need evidence.

671
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,270
Sir, you should report this
to the palace tomorrow morning.

672
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,380
Since you are safe,

673
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,010
I will return to the courtesan house.

674
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,650
Are you going to let her go alone?

675
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:46,790
Do you expect me to go with her?

676
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,330
Of course.

677
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,630
You really don't know anything
about women, do you?

678
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,100
She is a proud woman,
but her eyes welled up

679
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,600
because of you,
and you still don't see it?

680
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,200
And now you're sending her back alone?

681
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,740
How frustrating. Suit yourself.

682
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,740
You can be so dry.

683
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,640
Hey.

684
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,980
Dain!

685
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,550
Dain.

686
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,490
What is it?

687
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,230
It is dark so I will walk you there.

688
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,330
Pardon me?

689
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,540
Is this a part of your official business?

690
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:37,840
Of course it is. Official business.

691
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,050
Come.

692
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:59,130
By the way, Dain,

693
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,800
were you crying
because you thought I was dead?

694
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:06,670
What? Cried? Who cried?

695
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,510
You did.

696
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,010
What?

697
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,740
I did not! I didn't.

698
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,710
And why is that so important?

699
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,580
How infuriating.

700
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,420
It made me happy,

701
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,430
knowing there is a person

702
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,760
who would cry for me when I'm dead.

703
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,150
Sawol.

704
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,120
Sawol?

705
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:08,300
Sawol, what are you doing here?

706
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,670
Don't worry.
This is the royal secret agent.

707
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,610
Don't be afraid.

708
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:34,680
What happened?

709
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,320
What happened here?

710
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,590
You saw something, didn't you?

711
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,800
Tell us what you saw.

712
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,480
That night...

713
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,460
Sawol!

714
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:16,330
Sawol!

715
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,990
Sawol.

716
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,230
Sawol.

717
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,370
Who's there?

718
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,370
Stay with me, Sawol.

719
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,840
My baby. Please save my baby.

720
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,680
Sawol.

721
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,050
Sawol, stay with me, Sawol!

722
01:02:11,235 --> 01:02:14,202
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

723
01:02:14,227 --> 01:02:15,820
<i>What is it that you saw?</i>

724
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,450
<i>Why did you take us there?</i>

725
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,490
<i>I warned you never to show your face again</i>

726
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,620
<i>in this place!</i>

727
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,590
<i>The Sheriff asked me to bring you
with utmost care.</i>

728
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,830
<i>You crazy idiot!</i>

729
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,160
<i>If Lord Igyeom finds out, you're finished.</i>

730
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,530
<i>The only witness is dead.</i>

731
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:28,970
<i>They are destroying any and all evidence.</i>

732
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:30,570
<i>He is an expert archer.</i>

733
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,240
<i>Do you have an idea who it is?</i>

734
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,240
<i>When you get him drunk and ask,
he might tell you something.</i>

735
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,270
<i>I will deal with him.</i>

736
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,040
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

737
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,870
<i>I'm Honglang.</i>

738
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,980
<i>Winning over a man's heart
is a piece of cake.</i>
