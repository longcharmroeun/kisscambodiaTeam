1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,300
Chunsam.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,640
Darn it.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,210
Hi, there.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,940
Get him! Get him!

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,740
Where?

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,510
Get him!

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,051
EPISODE 9

8
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,510
What?

9
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,779
Stop!

10
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,779
Stop, stop, stop.

11
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,420
Stop!

12
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,650
Stop playing!

13
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,090
Your mask is that of a butcher,

14
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,590
but your clothes say otherwise.

15
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,400
Are you playing a nobleman-like butcher?

16
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,500
Or are you trying to be
a butcher-like nobleman?

17
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:26,810
Chunsam.

18
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,740
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,910
Let me see that.

20
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,590
You are...

21
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,100
Lord Seong, what is happening here?

22
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,670
Ask him.

23
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,240
This is Lord Kim's son.

24
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,480
I know.

25
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,250
So, tell me.

26
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,720
Why did you go to that house?

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,350
I was passing by
and stepped inside by chance.

28
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,920
Is that a crime?

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,520
You covered your face
to a place where you stepped in by chance?

30
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,690
Is covering my face a crime?

31
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,860
Lord Seong, if there is no evidence,

32
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,060
I suggest we free him
before this gets out of control.

33
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,130
You were searching for something
in that house.

34
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,670
Tell me. What were you searching for?

35
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,510
I heard a woman died,
so I thought I should stop by.

36
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,610
The owner is gone,
so I did not need permission to go inside.

37
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,810
I thought I might find
something interesting.

38
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,220
Something interesting?

39
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,650
Who knows?
There could be a money chest hidden there.

40
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,650
What?

41
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,789
What is happening here?

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,030
Lord Kim.

43
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,830
Father!

44
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,730
Father.

45
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,900
What are you doing?

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,140
Why is my son on the ground?

47
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,170
Well...

48
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,940
Your son was searching

49
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,810
through a dead woman's house
with his face covered.

50
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,550
He spotted me and fled,

51
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,620
so I apprehended him
and was interrogating him.

52
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,660
Are you saying my son is the culprit?

53
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,430
Did you kill that woman?

54
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,700
No, Father. I did not.

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,000
You got your answer, so untie him.

56
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,910
Lord Seong, he's not going
to be answering anymore questions.

57
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,780
We will get another chance,
so let him go for now.

58
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,590
Untie him.

59
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,990
Yes, sir.

60
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,010
Why is everyone fussing
over a peasant girl's death?

61
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,050
What was that?

62
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,890
- Lord Seong!
- Sir!

63
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,060
What on earth are you doing?

64
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,590
Tell me.

65
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,630
Why did you go to that house?

66
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,730
What are you waiting for?

67
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,000
Who dares to attack him?

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,700
Challenging the authority of a royal agent
is considered treason, don't you know?

69
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,640
Tell me now!

70
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,340
Please spare me.

71
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,020
The class difference
does not exist before death.

72
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,990
What right does your son have
to look down on people

73
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,030
and belittle the death of one?

74
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,230
Take him.

75
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,500
I will not let this be.

76
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,240
Come.

77
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,390
Lord Seong, do you think that man has
something to do with Miss Gwiseon's death?

78
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,790
He is definitely hiding something.

79
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,760
I am sure he killed her.

80
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,260
How can you be sure?

81
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,270
First of all,

82
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,400
he's a prick.

83
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,400
He's irritating.

84
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,040
If I could, I would love to lock him up.

85
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,880
Even if you did, he would be freed
due to lack of evidence.

86
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,610
Kim Daegwang.

87
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,510
I need to know what kind of man he is.

88
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,920
What is the progress on the interrogations
of the officials who received bribes?

89
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,120
They all confessed their sins.

90
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,830
Was there anyone who conspired with them?

91
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,330
I have interrogated on the matter
as you ordered,

92
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,770
but no other names beside
those on the ledger were mentioned.

93
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,440
How is that possible?

94
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,140
Did you execute proper interrogations?

95
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,510
Chief Royal Secretary Jang!

96
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,850
How dare you speak before His Majesty?

97
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,950
I am ashamed, Your Majesty.

98
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,200
Chief of Royal Investigation Bureau,

99
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,800
keep an eye on whether or not
they change their statements.

100
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,770
Chief Royal Secretary Jang.

102
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,510
Chief Royal Secretary Jang!

103
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,509
Does it please you to humiliate me
before His Majesty and other officials?

104
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:05,379
Lord!

105
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,580
Do you truly believe
the prisoners' statements?

106
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,050
What?

107
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,050
Do you think I am a fool?

108
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,090
Calm yourself.

109
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,430
Are you interfering with the business
of the Royal Investigation Bureau now?

110
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,270
What would people outside think
if we stall the investigation?

111
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,500
It is time we close the case.

112
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,380
Everyone is eager to close the case,

113
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,610
so how can I not be suspicious?

114
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,020
Why, why that... How dare he!

115
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,030
His Majesty gives him too much liberty,
and that went to his head.

116
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,930
When one's faith is great,
the feeling of betrayal is also great.

117
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,410
Let us have a drink.

118
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,800
Thank you for your hard work.

119
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,330
You are too kind.
I should say the same for you.

120
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,440
The most urgent issue has been dealt,
but I am concerned about the future.

121
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,340
Lord Jang has His Majesty
wrapped around his little finger.

122
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,550
Father, how long will you continue
to let that crafty man run wild?

123
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,290
While that crafty man is busy playing
with his royal agent,

124
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,190
we will find his weakness
and end him.

125
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,660
Yes.

126
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,430
Let us drink.

127
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,130
Yes.

128
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,540
That bastard!

129
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,010
The king is behind the royal agent,
so how could you compete with him?

130
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,180
Maybe that royal agent came after you
because he wants a bribe.

131
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,820
That was not it!

132
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,450
He really tried to kill me.

133
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,120
That royal agent. How dare he.

134
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,860
How do I get my revenge?

135
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,800
We must drive that royal agent
out of our town, so we can breathe.

136
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,070
Should we kill him?

137
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,070
Don't. You will only make matters worse.

138
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,780
You want to voluntarily walk
into the enemy's lair like a fool?

139
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,880
Use your head.

140
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,050
So what are you suggesting?

141
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,320
Just drink.

142
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,530
That girl with the royal agent.

143
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,260
She seemed quite nice.

144
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,560
Yes.

145
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,070
Oh, look at you.

146
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,730
You had your heart set on something else.

147
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,540
There are plenty of girls here.

148
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,340
Oh, since she is from Hanyang,

149
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,980
you're thinking she must be different,
aren't you?

150
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,860
Sir, sir.

151
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,400
This is bad.

152
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,570
What is bad?

153
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,070
I have to go.

154
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,870
Then go.

155
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,540
Come with me, please.

156
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,580
The atmosphere here is spooky.

157
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,310
I cannot go alone.

158
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,150
How come a grown man
cannot go to the outhouse alone?

159
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,250
Just this once.

160
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,420
I have to go, so please come with me.

161
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,650
Please, I beg you.

162
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,330
That felt great.

163
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,140
I can finally breathe.

164
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,710
Sir, is something wrong?

165
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,110
I am a royal secret agent,

166
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,450
and I had to stand guard
while you took a dump.

167
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,980
I feel ashamed.

168
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,890
When you go, I will stand guard for you.

169
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,560
Get lost.

170
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,720
Why?

171
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
I said get lost.

172
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,190
I will stand guard for you.

173
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,290
Stop it!

174
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,140
Who's there?

175
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,520
My heart!

176
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,460
What is the meaning of this?

177
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,530
What are you doing here?

178
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,870
He and I had a private conversation
as one man to another.

179
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,100
A private conversation?

180
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,000
Something like that.

181
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,780
What are you doing with a knife
so late at night?

182
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,350
Well...

183
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,720
Someone was watching you?

184
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,620
Yes, a man was watching me.

185
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,230
It really wasn't you?

186
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,060
What are you insinuating?

187
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,960
I told you the mood here is creepy.

188
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,670
Maybe it was that.

189
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,670
A ghost.

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,400
A ghost?

191
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,210
Yes, every government office
has its own ghost, people say.

192
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,510
Magistrate... Magistrate...

193
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,720
This is why you cannot go
to the outhouse by yourself.

194
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,890
It is late, so go to sleep.

195
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,030
Oh, he might come back,

196
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,760
so keep that silver knife close to you.

197
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,730
Lord Seong.

198
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,600
What is it?

199
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
It's nothing.

200
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Lady Dain, what's that?

201
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,240
Magistrate...

202
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,740
Oh, stop it!

203
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,040
- Come with me.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,990
Aren't you coming?

205
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,760
You go ahead.

206
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,190
Magistrate.... Magistrate...

207
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,160
I said go.

208
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
You come too.

209
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,810
Lord Seong.

210
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,480
Aren't you tired?

211
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,950
I am fully awake.

212
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,220
I will stay here, so you can relax.

213
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Lord Seong.

214
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,600
I am here.

215
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,210
Aren't you scared?

216
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,210
What could scare a grown man?

217
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,580
You were terrified of that snake.

218
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,580
Hey.

219
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,190
I was ever so slightly surprised.

220
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:43,059
I am your attendant,
so I should be assisting you,

221
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,930
but I feel it is the opposite.

222
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,430
I agree with you.

223
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,269
I must be unfortunate.

224
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,210
When it comes to being unfortunate,
I am second to none.

225
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,980
Two unfortunate people together...

226
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,650
No wonder my secret mission
is filled with misfortune.

227
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,120
But I don't mind it.

228
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,700
Aren't you going to sleep?

229
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,400
I am fully awake.

230
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,940
Liar.

231
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,810
You fall asleep the moment
you lay your head on your pillow.

232
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,940
Dain.

233
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,570
I don't mind it either.

234
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,430
You failed to handle the royal agent.

235
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,760
You have worked for me for over a decade.

236
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,740
Where is the man who was once called
the Spirit of Death?

237
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,840
I feel ashamed, Lord Kim.

238
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,590
You risked death
and came back for my punishment.

239
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,860
You are naive.

240
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,210
How can I kill the dog
that returned to its owner?

241
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,020
I will give you one final chance.

242
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,510
There is a girl named
Hong Dain who is with the royal agent.

243
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,980
It is she.

244
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,720
The courtesan Honglang
who spied for Jang Taeseung.

245
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,090
A girl on such a rough
and dangerous mission?

246
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,100
Didn't one of my men see her coming
out of Jang Taeseung's house?

247
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,500
Yes, Father.

248
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,200
If we investigate her,
we might learn of Jang's weaknesses.

249
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,880
Jang must have been
providing for her, keeping her hidden.

250
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,780
Sneak into his house

251
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,620
and thoroughly search Hong Dain's room.

252
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,390
I need to know who she is.

253
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,720
Yes, sir.

254
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,810
Lord Seong.

255
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,610
What if you catch a cold?

256
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,450
Sir, you slept out here?

257
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,280
He slept here to protect you.

258
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,420
Lord Seong. Lord Seong?

259
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,360
Where am I?

260
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,830
Go inside.

261
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,330
You might have a stroke.

262
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,430
What? Am I all right?

263
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,170
Yes, you are all right.

264
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,610
Chunsam, what were you doing?

265
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,040
How could you sleep inside
when Lord Seong was out here?

266
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,680
When does he ever listen to me?

267
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,450
To be frank,

268
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,180
you and Lord Igyeom have
already slept together,

269
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,820
so why did he sleep outside?

270
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,750
Slept together?

271
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,850
I am an unmarried woman.

272
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,660
When you sleep in the same room,
that is sleeping together.

273
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,630
Come and sleep together with me.

274
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,230
Am I all right?

275
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,430
How dare he?

276
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,500
I will pay a visit to the herb seller.

277
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,070
He is the only acquaintance
of Miss Gwiseon,

278
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,770
so he may know something.

279
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,640
Chunsam, keep an eye on Kim Daegwang.

280
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,610
Yes, sir.

281
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,310
And Dain, someone came after you
last night, so you will join me.

282
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,520
I am all right.

283
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,150
No, it is still dangerous.

284
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,890
Wait, what about me?
I am not in danger?

285
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,320
You are a big man,
so why are you so scared?

286
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,020
You think someone's going to hit you?

287
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,930
Who would dare to hit Park Chunsam?

288
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,060
Am I the kind of man who would
let someone hit me and get away with it?

289
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,370
I am glad to hear that.

290
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,500
Yes.

291
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,370
Let us go.

292
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,240
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,320
Ibeom,

294
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,950
can we stop for a break?

295
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,790
Sure.

296
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,690
Sit down.

297
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,240
Are you all right?

298
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,110
Yes.

299
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,440
Let me see your foot.

300
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,540
I am fine.

301
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,950
You've been walking in this condition?

302
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,860
I am fine.

303
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,700
It is getting dark. We must hurry.

304
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,520
Stop right there.

305
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,920
What could this be about?

306
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,620
I am sure it has nothing to do with us,
so don't act rashly.

307
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,530
Yes.

308
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,530
Let me see your identification.

309
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,540
Is something wrong?

310
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,770
There has been a murder,
and we are looking for evidence.

311
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,810
A murder?

312
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,110
You are not from here,
so what brings you to this remote place?

313
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,120
My mother-in-law is gravely ill,
so I am traveling to pay her a visit.

314
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,000
By the way, have we met before?

315
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,640
Well, I have never been here.

316
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,240
No, no, I am sure I have seen you.

317
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,380
Where was it?

318
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,700
I am not well.

319
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,170
Is there a place we can lodge?

320
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,980
There is a town down that way.

321
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,580
Thank you.

322
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,920
They have an injured woman with them,
so they cannot be bandits.

323
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,050
Let us go.

324
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,490
Pardon my intrusion.

325
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,060
Come.

326
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,470
Are you all right?

327
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,570
I can walk.

328
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,170
They keep watching us.

329
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,550
Get on my back.

330
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,950
No, they will be suspicious.

331
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,590
If a husband turns his back
on his injured wife,

332
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,060
that would look suspicious.

333
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,690
You should let him carry you.

334
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,890
That would be helpful for us.

335
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,370
In that case, thank you.

336
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,850
Anyone home? Is anyone home?

337
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,000
I don't think anyone's home.

338
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,470
It is an herb gatherer's house.

339
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,370
The gatherer must be out
looking for herbs.

340
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,540
Sometimes it takes herb gatherers days
before coming back home,

341
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,080
so let us go inside and get some rest.

342
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,240
We are of similar backgrounds,
so the gatherer will understand.

343
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,090
Lord Ibeom, where are you going?

344
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,320
I will go down to the town
and get some food and medicine.

345
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,760
I will go.

346
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Look after Sunae.

347
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,130
I will be back shortly.

348
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,260
Yes.

349
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,840
What brings you to my humble abode?

350
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,240
I came to ask you something.

351
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,480
Please come inside.

352
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,620
There was something odd.

353
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,250
Tell me.

354
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,260
Before she died, Gwiseon came to see me.

355
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,430
She handed me a bunch of herbs
and said she was quitting herb gathering.

356
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,100
For what reason?

357
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,900
She did not tell me.

358
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,540
Do you know a man named Kim Daegwang?

359
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,370
Yes, I introduced him to Gwiseon.

360
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,810
Introduced him? What do you mean by that?

361
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,420
He came to me and asked
if I could get opium poppies for him,

362
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,550
so I told him to visit Gwiseon
because she can find anything.

363
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,590
Opium poppies?

364
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,690
He mistook opium poppy tea for water.

365
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,900
Lord Seong, that means...

366
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,760
Yes.

367
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,830
In that house,
Kim Daegwang was searching for...

368
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,740
Opium poppies.

369
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:33,294
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

370
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,720
Go.

371
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,280
What brings you here?

372
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,380
You won't even look up?

373
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,720
What is this about?

374
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,590
The man who just left,

375
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,160
why did he come here?

376
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,290
He left empty handed,
so he couldn't have bought a mask.

377
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,590
It's none of your concern.

378
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,200
Just tell me.

379
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't know what this is about,
but I can't talk without compensation.

380
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,640
What? Are you a thief?

381
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:21,110
There are those who steal
from common folks,

382
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,710
so this is nothing.

383
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,880
Take it.

384
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,390
He ordered a mask.

385
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,620
A mask? What kind of mask?

386
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,730
I am making it right now.

387
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,970
Why are you making that mask?

388
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,540
Darn it. Take it.

389
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,410
What is the reason?

390
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,850
Someone needs it, so I'm making it.

391
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,420
I mean who would wear such a creepy mask?

392
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,890
Your eyes.

393
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,720
Fine. But there's no more of it.

394
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,890
Take it.

395
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,630
Courtesans mostly buy these.

396
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,200
Courtesans? Why do they buy that mask?

397
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,700
How annoying.

398
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,640
Here, take them all.

399
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,680
Now tell me everything.

400
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,310
I do not know why.

401
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,020
What?

402
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,680
How could you say that
after taking all my money?

403
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,290
I told you I did not know.

404
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,490
I cannot believe this.

405
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,960
I haven't introduced myself,
so you must not know,

406
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,500
but the royal secret agent...

407
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,400
Royal secret agent?

408
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,740
I am with the royal secret agent.

409
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,170
I'm Park Chunsam.

410
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,480
Go to the courtesan house.

411
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,510
I overheard what
the courtesans were saying.

412
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,650
They said that they send courtesans
to a secret banquet.

413
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,580
A secret banquet?

414
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,600
Oh, my heart.

415
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,400
Where are you going in such a hurry?

416
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Wait, are you looking for someone?

417
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,140
Looking? I'm not looking for anyone.

418
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,710
Really? I thought you were looking for me
because you've been following me.

419
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,720
Me? I was following you?

420
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,550
Yes.

421
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,790
Why would I follow you?

422
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,760
That's nonsense.

423
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,330
I wouldn't know. But you would.

424
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,030
What?

425
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,330
I don't really know.

426
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,840
I will tell you.

427
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,850
Was it Kim Daegwang who killed Gwiseon?
Because of opium poppies?

428
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,720
I suspect him too,
but we need proper evidence.

429
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,450
Now tell me.

430
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,149
Why were you following me?

431
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:54,859
It must've been the royal agent's order.

432
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,899
Why are you hitting me
when you already know?

433
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,870
The royal agent is after me?

434
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,939
I feel like I am a big shot.

435
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,169
Sir.

436
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,189
Lord Seong, stop pacing.

437
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:25,120
What is taking Chunsam so long?

438
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,390
What if he is impersonating
a royal agent again?

439
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,890
I doubt that.

440
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,590
He would be lucky if he doesn't get
beaten up.

441
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,400
Sheriff, I am glad to see you.

442
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,740
Is something wrong?

443
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,750
Sir.

444
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,780
Chunsam.

445
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,490
What happened?

446
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,890
What happened to your face?

447
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,520
I caught him trying to steal my money.

448
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,730
No, that is not true.

449
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,060
I would never steal, sir.

450
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,760
Do you have proof?

451
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,930
I saw it, and that is proof enough.

452
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,100
What?

453
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,270
You humiliated me and my father
based on circumstantial evidence

454
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,270
and accused me of killing that girl.

455
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,610
Sheriff, put this thief in prison.

456
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,150
Lord Seong, too bad you seem to
be having a hard time in this town.

457
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,760
I think it's time for you to leave.

458
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,230
If you do, I will let your servant go
and drop the suit.

459
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,130
How dare you threaten a royal agent?

460
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,170
There is no need for that.

461
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,310
What is the punishment for thieving?

462
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,580
It is 100 flogging.

463
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,750
Flog him 100 times.

464
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,890
What? 100?

465
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,320
No!

466
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,020
Chunsam!

467
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,930
However, before that takes place,

468
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,630
I must speak to your father.

469
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,500
Why do you need to speak to him?

470
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,810
I must tell him his precious son
is addicted to opium poppy.

471
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,940
What do you mean...

472
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,340
The very thing you were searching for
at Gwiseon's house, I mean.

473
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,350
If he learns you were searching for
opium poppies at an herb gatherer's house,

474
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,620
he will be so pleased.

475
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,130
Fine.
I will forget about today's incident.

476
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,770
What already happened cannot be forgotten.

477
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,110
Chunsam! Chunsam!

478
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,580
That hurts!

479
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,720
I thought you were dead.

480
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,150
I almost died.

481
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,050
Ouch, that hurts.

482
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,520
Stay still.

483
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,180
Since you are putting
the ointment on me,

484
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,340
it feels like the pain is melting away.

485
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,210
Really?

486
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,710
Isn't that too much?

487
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,480
Can you move up?

488
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,490
- Up?
- Yes.

489
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,850
There? A little more?

490
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,120
- There?
- Yes, that's nice.

491
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,830
What?

492
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,590
How dare you act like a hero?

493
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:56,130
Sir, I swear on all of my ancestors.

494
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,370
I did not steal his money.

495
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,500
I know.

496
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,610
You knew, and you still
told them to flog me?

497
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,440
You did not get flogged.

498
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,510
You are so harsh.

499
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,480
You don't know
what kind of ordeal I suffered.

500
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,150
I do know.

501
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,320
Can't you see I am fighting my anger?

502
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,350
Hitting you is like hitting me.

503
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,050
He will not get away with this.

504
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,960
Kim Daegwang ordered a mask,
so I looked into it,

505
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,130
and it was to attend a secret banquet.

506
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,230
A secret banquet?

507
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,770
Yes, you must wear a mask to get in.

508
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,940
A secret banquet
where you must wear a mask.

509
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,510
And I heard that they bring
courtesans with them.

510
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,680
I need to visit the courtesan house.

511
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,050
Isn't the owner of the house dead?

512
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,550
She is.

513
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,700
Who are you?

514
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,770
Sunae, they must be
the owners of this house.

515
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,100
I apologize.

516
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,370
We were passing by,
but I got hurt, so we were resting.

517
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,110
Please forgive our intrusion.

518
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,080
You think we own this house?

519
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,320
Do we look like we live here?

520
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,820
The richest man in town
must look like an herb gatherer to her.

521
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,290
There is something we need to find here.

522
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,760
We were supposed to get it
from the owner of this house,

523
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,930
but she died.

524
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,560
What are you looking for?

525
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,470
Munho,

526
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,600
there is something even nicer here
than what we were looking for.

527
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,400
How about we take it with us?

528
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,970
Yes, that is not a bad idea.

529
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,210
What are you doing?

530
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,080
Just get your stuff and leave.

531
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,520
I am the kind of man who must get
what I want.

532
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,320
Come here.

533
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,230
Leave while I am being polite.

534
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,760
You idiot.

535
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,770
Get on your knees.

536
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,740
Mandeok.

537
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,940
Sunae.

538
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,920
Come in.

539
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,150
You are muscular.

540
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,860
Sir, is this your first visit here?

541
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,520
I've always wanted to come.

542
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,360
You girls leave
and get us the head courtesan.

543
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,160
Sir, are we not enough for you?

544
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,600
We will take good care of you.

545
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,700
Come and have a seat.

546
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,240
Sit, sit. I've wanted to sit.

547
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,270
Park Chunsam.

548
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,270
Go and get the head courtesan!

549
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,250
I said to get her.
I did not say leave.

550
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,130
I heard you were asking for me.

551
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,330
Sit down.

552
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,940
I heard that you send courtesans
to the banquet.

553
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,740
I beg your pardon?
I do not understand you.

554
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,680
The secret banquet
where you wear a mask.

555
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,250
I have never heard of...

556
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,020
Would you rather be taken
to the government office and be tortured

557
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,260
than to talk right now?

558
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,500
I do not know anything.

559
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,230
Look here.

560
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,970
Is this how you want to end up?

561
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,810
He has the patience of a child,
so you better talk now.

562
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,780
Hey.

563
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,280
I cannot go there.

564
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
I heard you send people there.

565
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,290
Are they your courtesans?

566
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,690
No.

567
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,460
All I did was introduce the opportunity

568
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,690
to the prostitutes.

569
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,260
Tell me what you know.

570
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:29,110
You can make money there
and enjoy opium poppy,

571
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,780
so I heard everyone wants to go.

572
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,580
Opium poppy?

573
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,980
Something smells fishy.

574
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,250
What do you need to do to go there?

575
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,030
Mandeok.

576
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,400
Mandeok, what happened here?

577
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,670
I'm sorry.

578
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,210
I failed to protect Sunae.

579
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,670
Where did she go?

580
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,640
They took her.

581
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,110
They? Who?

582
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,380
He said he is the richest man in town.

583
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,580
You must hurry and find her.

584
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,120
We don't know what they might to do her.

585
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,720
Lord Jang is still awake.

586
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,890
You must hurry.

587
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,210
Lord Jang.

588
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,920
Is someone here?

589
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,020
No.

590
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,950
Do you need something?

591
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,860
No. I came out to get some air.

592
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,460
You may go.

593
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,360
Yes, sir.

594
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,120
I found an okro used by
the royal family in her room.

595
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:30,850
If we find the owner,
we will be able to find out who she is.

596
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,460
It is made with gold,

597
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,160
so it must be a token of affection from
an idiotic member of the royal family.

598
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,470
This is...

599
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,800
What is it, Father?

600
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,140
This belonged to that man.

601
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,510
Who?

602
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,110
Prince Hwiyeong.

603
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:55,610
What? Prince Hwiyeong?

604
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,530
He might get suspicious,
so I will go in alone.

605
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,560
What are you looking for?

606
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,530
I am a new courtesan,

607
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:57,540
and I need a mask for the banquet.

608
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,820
May I ask you a question?

609
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,160
Who is the richest man in this town?

610
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,060
The richest man?

611
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,930
Lord Jeong is the richest man here.

612
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,900
Even the dogs know that.

613
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,160
Lord Jeong?

614
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,000
Where is his house?

615
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,190
You look dreadful.

616
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,800
You look terrible too.

617
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
What are we doing?

618
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,970
Lord Seong, are you dressed?

619
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,180
Must we do this?

620
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:13,050
We must do this to catch the man
who killed those women.

621
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,320
It won't take long.

622
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,220
Where are your masks?

623
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,490
Sir.

624
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,000
Over there.

625
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,330
Put your mask on.

626
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,140
Yes, sir.

627
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,530
Is everyone here?

628
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,300
Follow me.

629
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,680
I brought the women.

630
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,610
Let them in.

631
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,890
Come here.

632
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,360
Are we short of women?

633
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,730
No, I will go and check.

634
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,400
Let us get started.

635
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,430
Enjoy yourselves tonight!

636
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:19,670
Let us have a party.

637
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:41,090
What did you eat to make your body
feel as tough as a rock?

638
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,030
Oh, I don't know.

639
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,560
This is what I like.

640
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:26,270
This is...

641
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,440
I brought what you have been waiting for!

642
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,280
Oh, it is finally here!

643
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:58,970
Yes, yes.

644
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,880
What are you waiting for?

645
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,960
I want to talk to this girl
in a more private manner.

646
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,200
Me?

647
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,100
Come with me.

648
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,800
Come, come!

649
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,940
Enjoy yourselves.

650
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,270
Let us go!

651
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:14,280
Come, come, come, come.

652
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,780
Come, come!

653
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,960
Drink.

654
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,300
Wait.

655
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:43,810
It is no fun without this.

656
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,180
Drink.

657
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,290
Sir,

658
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,230
there is a drinking style
that is popular in Hanyang.

659
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,990
Would you care to try it?

660
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,900
Drinking style?

661
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,330
Yes.

662
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,600
Show me.

663
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,310
But I cannot...

664
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,410
Do it alone.

665
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,490
To tonight.

666
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:32,760
Yes.

667
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:34,960
Cheers.

668
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,770
This way.

669
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:00,750
Sir.

670
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,680
Sh!

671
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,460
Did you bring the money?

672
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,530
Yes. Here are 30 coins.

673
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,430
I can only give you half for that.

674
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,260
What do you mean?

675
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,800
This was what I paid until recently.

676
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,170
The girl who grew opium poppies died.

677
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,500
What? How?

678
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:25,110
She got killed trying to report us
to the royal agent.

679
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,910
The price will continue
to climb for a while.

680
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,180
Do you want it or not?

681
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,750
I'll take it.

682
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,440
Who are you?

683
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,170
Is Gwiseon the person you said
who grew opium poppies?

684
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:03,480
Royal secret agent?

685
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,500
Sleep tight.

686
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,040
What are you doing there?

687
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,850
I had to pee.

688
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,880
Hurry up and go inside.

689
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,680
Yes.

690
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,160
Yes, sir.

691
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,200
Take off your mask.

692
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,100
I would like to see your face.

693
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:58,070
No.

694
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,670
You are sweet.

695
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,670
There is no one here, so it is fine.

696
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,480
Still, I cannot.

697
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,380
What are you doing?

698
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:23,590
Please don't. It is not proper.

699
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:26,060
Well, I understand.

700
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,130
Is this what you want?

701
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,200
What is that?

702
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,770
What else?

703
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,640
Take it.

704
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,350
Opium poppy powder.

705
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,620
There isn't much time.

706
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,460
You can't.

707
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,520
Stay still!

708
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,460
Don't do this. No.

709
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,130
Stop it.

710
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,160
Stop it! Stop!

711
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:02,970
What?

712
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,700
I can't take this anymore.

713
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,140
Why are you screaming?

714
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:09,870
Come here.

715
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,310
I need to teach you a lesson.

716
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,780
Stop it!

717
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,250
What are you doing?

718
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,450
Come here, you.

719
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,580
Ouch, that little...

720
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,580
Ground opium poppy.

721
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,160
It is late,

722
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,560
so how come your son
is nowhere to be seen?

723
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,400
I do not know.

724
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:39,800
He was always serious about his studies,

725
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,640
but I do not know where he went tonight.

726
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,770
Do you know anything?

727
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,810
Tell him.

728
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,350
Well, actually,

729
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,280
young master said he would kill me
if I tell anyone.

730
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,020
Where is he right now?

731
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:04,460
This is paradise.

732
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:35,360
I have prepared something exciting
for you tonight.

733
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:38,600
Are your pockets full tonight?

734
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,360
Bring her in!

735
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,840
This is a safe one.

736
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,280
Are you sure?

737
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,580
I heard a royal agent is in town.

738
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:59,420
He won't stay here forever.

739
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,120
He will leave soon.

740
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:06,590
Will you lose this chance
because of that royal agent?

741
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,190
We will begin with 100 coins.

742
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,160
Hundred!

743
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,160
One-fifty!

744
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:11,930
Two hundred!

745
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:12,900
Two hundred coins?

746
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,630
Anyone else?

747
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,040
Take off her mask,
and I will raise it to 300.

748
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:23,970
Sure.

749
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:40,990
We will start again at 300 coins.

750
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:29,093
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

751
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,010
<i>What are you doing?</i>

752
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:31,010
<i>I am the royal secret agent!</i>

753
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,010
<i>You stop right there!</i>

754
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,240
<i>I will rescue Lady Sunae.</i>

755
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,980
<i>This is an okro.</i>

756
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,580
<i>That is Prince Hwiyeong's okro.</i>

757
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,850
<i>Who was that with a dokkebi mask?</i>

758
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,920
<i>Where is he right now?</i>

759
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,219
<i>Are you going to let
that royal agent run wild?</i>

760
01:02:42,219 --> 01:02:43,250
<i>I will make my decision.</i>

761
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,920
<i>That traitor's belonging was found
in your home.</i>

762
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,560
<i>But that girl must know.</i>

763
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,430
<i>The girl named Hong Dain.</i>

764
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,230
<i>Summon that girl
and the royal secret agent.</i>

765
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,330
<i>Is that true?</i>

766
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,830
<i>I think something happened.</i>
