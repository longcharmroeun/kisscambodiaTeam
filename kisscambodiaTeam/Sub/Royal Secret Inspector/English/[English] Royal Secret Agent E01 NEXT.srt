00:00:06,244 --> 00:00:07,604
EPISODE 1

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,950
What is your business?

3
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,130
I came from Hwaeomsan
to see the sheriff.

4
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,630
You don't look familiar.

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,700
Are you here alone?
What about the others?

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,600
They will arrive soon.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,130
How much gold will these yield?

8
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,930
Enough to fill a money chest, I'm sure.

9
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,829
Oh, yes.

10
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,070
However...

11
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,570
What?

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,340
Workers are dying from intense labor.

13
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,380
They're suffering
from injuries and an epidemic.

14
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,450
They are criminals.

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,480
Hard labor is their punishment to bear,

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,620
so why must I be concerned with them?

17
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,090
Do you truly not hear the cries

18
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,900
of the people suffering

19
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,500
from a corrupt official's extortion?

20
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,270
What? A corrupt official?

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,270
How dare you!

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,780
Here comes the royal secret agent!

23
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,810
What?

24
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,320
- Where? Where is he?
- It's the royal secret agent!

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,950
Where's the royal secret...

26
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,090
Here I am. A royal secret agent.

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,500
So, tell me.

28
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,600
What did you do with all that
abundant amount of gold?

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,710
You!

30
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,010
Tell the truth!

31
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:49,920
Who are you?

32
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,230
You covered your face,
so you must not be a man of honor.

33
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,000
It's you.

34
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,900
{\an8}ONE MONTH LATER

35
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,540
Your Majesty, the secret agent system
must be abolished.

36
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,070
For what reason?

37
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,440
The royal secret agent
is an outdated system.

38
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,680
Recently, it has become difficult
for the royal agents to maintain cover.

39
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,540
And moreover, some royal agents have
revealed their secret identities

40
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,450
and are taking bribes.

41
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,820
The royal agents have acted
as my eyes and ears,

42
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,930
and given me a chance to listen
to my subjects' hardships.

43
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,430
Moreover, they exposed corrupt officials,

44
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,900
rescuing and comforting
my subjects from misery.

45
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,670
Do you still say it is unnecessary?

46
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,010
We will do that for you.

47
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,580
Your Majesty, do you not trust us?

48
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,110
Dispatching secret agents
is my prerogative.

49
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,710
Do not interfere.

50
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,950
Your Majesty, rumor has it

51
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,190
that Head Special Advisor Park Cheolgyu
was killed

52
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,460
after being dispatched
as a royal secret agent.

53
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,400
Send no more agents
and prevent the loss of innocent lives.

54
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,070
Similar incidents occurred
in the previous generation,

55
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,140
but the late king never stopped
dispatching secret agents.

56
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:26,240
Park Cheolgyu was caring
for 3 children and his widowed mother.

57
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,350
Who will look after them now?

58
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,320
Your Majesty! I beg your kindness.

59
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,620
- We beg your kindness, Your Majesty!
- We beg your kindness, Your Majesty!

60
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,190
I have sent someone out into town.

61
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,600
I will be getting information soon,
so let's give it some time.

62
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,770
Who gave you permission to send a man?

63
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,600
I ordered him.

64
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,940
Why? Do I not have the authority?

65
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,180
This is not my night.

66
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,920
Five brass coins.

67
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,320
You know how to scare people.

68
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,150
I fold.

69
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,120
Oh, I fold too.

70
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,330
Born empty handed, die empty handed.

71
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,500
I will see your five coins
and raise you ten more.

72
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,409
While we are at it,

73
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,340
how about we raise the stakes?

74
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,509
I will see your ten coins

75
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,550
and raise you ten more.

76
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,650
I'm getting a bad feeling for some reason.

77
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,120
Fine.

78
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm going all-in.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,760
Eunuch Kim, are you sure?

80
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,660
I'm tired.

81
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,400
In that case...

82
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,930
Born empty handed, die empty handed, no?

83
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,600
This is why I like you.
Very straightforward.

84
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,340
Oh, stop it.

85
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,740
Let us do this.

86
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,780
Do you have two tens?

87
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,580
Then take it. I have...

88
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,790
Two nines.

89
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,930
Wait, please.

90
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,430
Give me one more chance.

91
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,270
What chance? You're out of money.

92
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,200
Can you please give me a small cut?

93
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,110
Lord Seong, why are you being so clingy?

94
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,470
You said, "Born empty handed,
die empty handed."

95
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,440
This has happened too many times!

96
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,010
Must you clean us out all the time?

97
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,120
What kind of joy do you think
I have in my life?

98
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,780
This is all I get.

99
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,620
Do not embarrass me and stand up.

100
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,290
Eunuch Kim, what is your secret?

101
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,660
My secret...

102
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,030
After I lost my manhood,

103
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,400
I also lost fear.

104
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
That may be my secret.

105
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,410
I apologize.

106
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,510
No need.

107
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,720
You! Make some noise when you come in.

108
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,820
Did you hear the news?

109
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,560
News? What news?

110
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,190
Actually,

111
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,330
it seems something happened
to the Head of Special Advisor.

112
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,370
But the Head of Special Advisor
is a royal secret...

113
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,170
Be careful with what you say.

114
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,970
Everyone already knows this.
Why make a fuss?

115
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,010
Tell us more.

116
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,640
Apparently,
he has not reported for a month.

117
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,210
What could be the reason?

118
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,750
I sincerely hope we meet again.

119
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,290
He was a great man.

120
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,060
Every royal agent has been killed.

121
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,930
Did you witness it for yourself?

122
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,970
Why are you attacking me?

123
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,170
Lord Seong, calm yourself.

124
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,280
I will see you again soon.

125
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,920
Did I win too much money?

126
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,520
Sir, you're back.

127
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,960
Did you win any money tonight?

128
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,230
You lost again?

129
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,500
Let's have some dinner.

130
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,970
Sir, I have something to show you.

131
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,100
Please come inside.

132
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,280
Sir, there's a fantastic new book out.

133
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,550
Fantastic?

134
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,380
Ta-da.

135
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,650
Erotic novels are all the same.

136
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,890
This one is completely different.

137
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,290
What's so different about it?

138
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,030
First of all, the plot is very shocking.

139
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:49,030
It is about a secret romance in the palace
with a court lady and eunuchs,

140
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,370
and I mean with multiple eunuchs.

141
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,540
Eunuchs and a court lady?

142
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,350
How is that possible, you idiot!

143
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,950
They'd be executed by dismemberment.

144
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,920
That's why it's so exciting.

145
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,890
Think about it.

146
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,200
Every eunuch in the palace
will die for a copy.

147
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,160
Eunuchs?

148
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,350
I hear you acquired a new novel.

149
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,590
The plot is quite shocking,
never-before-seen.

150
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,360
The last one was boring and disappointing.

151
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,230
I will take a look.

152
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,600
Here.

153
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,950
Whoa.

154
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,700
How many of these do you have?

155
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,000
Ten volumes.

156
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,370
Two brass coins per volume, twenty total.

157
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,130
Twenty.

158
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,670
No thank you.

159
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,370
Wait, just wait for a moment.

160
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,510
Give me a chance to finish.

161
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,880
It was twenty coins,
but come to think of it,

162
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,820
what joy would you have in life?

163
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,290
I will give them to you for ten coins.

164
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,790
Ten?

165
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,790
I need at least that much

166
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,100
to take my colleagues to a courtesan house
and treat them to drinks.

167
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,170
Don't you think?

168
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,000
Fine.

169
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,570
Take them out.

170
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,010
What could the chief royal secretary
Jang Taeseung have said to His Majesty?

171
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,080
They seem to work in perfect harmony.

172
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,790
Father, if Park Cheolgyu
is in fact in trouble,

173
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,190
we must hold the chief royal secretary
responsible.

174
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,500
He is right.
Before we locate Park Cheolgyu,

175
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,260
we cannot continue
the royal agent system.

176
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,940
No, we must observe for now.

177
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,440
What is your plan, Father?

178
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,110
When catching a big fish,

179
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,110
pulling prematurely to start a tug of war

180
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,550
will only help the fish break free.

181
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,920
But if you wait
until the fish grows weak...

182
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,890
The fish will jump into your basket,
demanding to be eaten.

183
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,740
I have a special event
planned for you tonight.

184
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,000
You do?

185
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,110
Come in.

186
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,760
Have you heard?

187
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,730
There's a new courtesan
named Honglang,

188
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,430
and apparently, every time she moves,
she leaves a scent of opium poppies.

189
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,970
What do you mean? Opium poppies?

190
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,580
It means she totally hypnotizes people.

191
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,370
That was good.

192
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,310
Let me pour you a drink.

193
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,310
So, what is your name?

194
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,280
My name is...

195
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,679
Honglang, where are you? Honglang!

196
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,050
What is all the noise?

197
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,520
Forgive me. Please excuse me for a moment.

198
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,490
Honglang!

199
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,160
I will show you what fun is.

200
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,100
Let go of me!

201
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,610
Why won't you accept my heart?

202
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,610
Who else could love you
more than I do in all of Joseon?

203
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,160
Fine.

204
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,840
If you refuse to accept my love,

205
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,780
I will die here.

206
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,150
Go ahead.

207
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,960
Well, Honglang...

208
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,840
I mean, there's no need...

209
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,870
I do not intend to accept your love,

210
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,200
so do stab yourself.

211
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,410
Hey! You think I can't do it?

212
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,480
I think you can do it.

213
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,080
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead.

214
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,150
Well, I was aiming for the knife.

215
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,520
Lord Seong,
where did you learn to do that?

216
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,400
For a courtesan, you are brazen.

217
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,300
You think you have power
over a person's life?

218
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,840
You saved a person from killing himself,

219
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,110
so it seems you have that power, my lord.

220
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,340
- What?
- You wasted your energy.

221
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,340
He never had the nerve to do it.

222
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,210
Insolence!
How dare you talk back to me?

223
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,190
If I was presumptuous, I apologize.

224
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,090
However, was I
the only one presumptuous?

225
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,760
Ha! Your high and mighty manners

226
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,960
tell me there is a powerful man
behind you.

227
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,630
Tell me.

228
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,100
Who is he?

229
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,270
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

230
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,780
But I mean, to support me...

231
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,610
He must be someone higher
than an assistant advisor.

232
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,650
Excuse me.

233
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,720
Why you...

234
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,790
Hwang Jini's beauty
with Nongae's spirit...

235
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,360
She sure is hypnotizing.

236
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,300
That girl... She's Honglang?

237
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,840
What? "He must be someone higher
than an assistant advisor?"

238
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,810
Where is Honglang?

239
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,920
Why does everyone want Honglang?

240
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,190
Be quiet. Go and get Honglang.

241
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,630
My lord, she is of another class.

242
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,200
High enough to look down
on an assistant advisor?

243
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,830
Go and bring her.

244
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,370
We're unable to do it,

245
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,870
so if you are desperate to see her,
get her yourself.

246
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,240
I need workers outside the city.

247
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,610
I want to buy some slaves at the market.

248
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,010
The market?

249
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,480
You mean the slave market?

250
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,250
But that is illegal.

251
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,650
Illegal...

252
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,290
That's true for those governed by the law.

253
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,730
Why do you insist
on using the slave market?

254
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,560
That way, no one will care
even if they die.

255
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,870
Now, enough about work.
Let us enjoy our drinks.

256
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,500
Yes.

257
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,820
Who are you?

258
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,870
I heard of your presence
and came to pay my respects.

259
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,640
I am Seong Igyeom, an assistant advisor
of the Office of Special Advisors.

260
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,310
Oh, there is no need
to pay me your respect here.

261
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,850
Enjoy yourself and go home.

262
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,750
Yes, Lord Kim. Please excuse me.

263
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,690
My lord, he came here
to pay his respects to you.

264
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,960
Don't be so haste in sending him away.

265
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,300
How about pouring him a drink?

266
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,270
Yes, you are right.

267
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,170
Come here and have a drink.

268
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,040
Pardon me?

269
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,580
Yes, thank you.

270
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,130
Really? Good idea.

271
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,070
He's good!

272
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,050
He is quite talented.

273
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,720
That is enough.

274
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,760
Heaven was definitely on my side tonight

275
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,460
to have the privilege of serving you.

276
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,530
Your name is Honglang, you said?

277
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,140
That is correct.

278
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,940
I will return to see you.

279
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,820
Let us go.

280
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,120
Goodnight.

281
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,620
Goodnight. Goodnight.

282
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,390
Goodnight.

283
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,500
Why don't you go home now?

284
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,810
Honglang!

285
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,680
How dare you toy with me?

286
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,290
You had all the fun, so what do you mean?

287
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,160
What?

288
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,620
Stop right there!

289
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,990
Where are you going?

290
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,230
Come back here!

291
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,100
Hey! How dare you? Let go of me!

292
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,000
I refuse to be humiliated like this!

293
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,910
Let him go.

294
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,020
My lord.

295
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,090
What is this?

296
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,560
This way.

297
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,870
My lord, tonight is not the only night.

298
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,570
It is late so do come back another night.

299
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,840
And I will serve you all night long.

300
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,610
All... Night long?

301
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,880
So, goodnight for now.

302
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,360
Why that wicked girl...

303
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,980
So what did you hear tonight?

304
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,850
Is there a slave market in town?

305
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,920
A slave market?

306
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,090
Yes, Kim Byeonggeun said
he needs slave workers outside the city.

307
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,490
Outside the city?

308
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,730
For what purpose?

309
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,100
That... I did not hear.

310
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,800
A scoundrel interrupted.

311
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,670
What scoundrel?

312
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,540
He's an assistant advisor
of the Office of Special Advisors.

313
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,010
An assistant advisor...

314
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,550
Was it... Seong Igyeom?

315
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,750
Yes, it was he.

316
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,680
What did he do?

317
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,550
I was looked down for being a courtesan,
so I taught him a lesson.

318
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,960
Indiscipline is getting to be
a problem in the palace.

319
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,690
Keep a close eye on Kim Byeonggeun.

320
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,930
He is plotting something.

321
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,170
He will return to the courtesan house.

322
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,970
I will find out everything then,
so do not worry.

323
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,040
Yes, good job.

324
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,870
You should return.

325
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,310
Haven't you forgotten anything?

326
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,010
What?

327
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,230
Since there was nothing special tonight...

328
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,400
This won't even cover
the traveling expenses.

329
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,340
The amount of information
was never an issue.

330
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,810
You can't keep doing this.

331
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,740
Don't be greedy
when you have nowhere to spend it.

332
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,410
I do have places to spend money.

333
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,310
You can do anything with money.

334
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,330
Enough?

335
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,700
You can be very petty sometimes.

336
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,800
Petty?

337
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,900
How dare you say such a thing?

338
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,440
Dain, haven't I taught you manners?

339
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,710
There you go again.

340
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,570
I'm leaving.

341
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,740
You are back.

342
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

343
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,520
I found this at the place
Park Cheolgyu was staying.

344
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,620
What is this?

345
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,230
It was the journal he kept
for seogye and byeoldan.

346
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,710
{\an8}SEOGYE: A REPORT THE OFFICIAL WRITES
AFTER FULFILLING THE KING'S ORDER

347
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,350
{\an8}BYEOLDAN: A LOCAL CIVIL AFFAIRS REPORT,
WHICH INCLUDES THE NAMES OF RESIDENTS

348
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,130
A journal?

349
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,340
Kang Inchung, the sheriff of this place,
has been overtaxing the residents.

350
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,510
Those who are unable to pay the taxes

351
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,580
must send their children
to do hard labor or sell them as slaves.

352
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,720
Many have grown used
to the sheriff's tyranny and extortion.

353
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,790
His maddening tyranny must be put to stop.

354
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,100
Find me a new royal secret agent quickly.

355
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,040
I need someone new and reliable.

356
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,650
Moreover, he mustn't be connected
to the local government officials.

357
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,850
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

358
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:56,855
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

359
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,960
Oh, you are alive!

360
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:05,560
Where did you go last night?

361
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,060
Did you enjoy a passionate night
with Honglang?

362
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,830
A passionate night?

363
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,340
Lord Seong, is that true?

364
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,510
Don't even start.

365
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,750
That girl, Honglang,
totally toyed with me.

366
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,550
Toyed...

367
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,280
It was that good?

368
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,580
Tell us more.

369
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,520
Oh, let us not talk about it.

370
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,960
Why not?

371
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,860
Why not? Tell us!

372
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,660
What happened?

373
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,960
I will give you two coins.

374
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,170
Yes, please.

375
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,600
Honglang was...

376
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,440
Of another class.

377
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,280
Another class?

378
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,680
How so?

379
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,530
Welcome. What are you looking for?

380
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,500
I am looking for a man.

381
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,730
I hear you are
one of the best in the field.

382
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,500
I just go lurk around
asking people questions

383
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,570
and gather bits and pieces
of useful information.

384
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,040
So, who are you looking for?

385
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,010
I want to find

386
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,420
a man who worked in Seonjeonkwan.

387
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,390
In Seonjeonkwan...

388
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,020
That will be 50 coins.

389
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,060
What did you say?

390
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,700
Fifty coins for finding a man?

391
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,070
I must look into
the government records for this.

392
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,240
And they are top secret documents
to which only chroniclers have access to.

393
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,440
I will need to bribe a chronicler
for information, no?

394
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,020
Fine. How long do you need?

395
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,420
Five days will be enough.

396
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,360
I will pay you the rest
when you get me the information.

397
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,870
There is no one, not a single man.

398
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:30,500
{\an8}ASSISTANT ROYAL GUARD CHOI DOGWAN

399
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,240
Of all the men in the government,

400
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,410
there is not a single man.

401
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,810
A special person always appears
at the most unexpected place,

402
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,380
so why not take a step back
and widen your search?

403
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,750
Yes.

404
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,690
I should go.

405
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,270
There is an officer working this late?

406
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,640
I fold.

407
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,670
I also fold.

408
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,740
Me also.

409
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,450
You cannot all fold.

410
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,980
And let us try smiling.

411
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,820
We're doing this for entertainment, no?

412
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,220
Stop talking and start dealing.

413
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,260
Put them back in here.

414
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,860
Hurry up and pick.

415
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,720
By the way, did you hear the rumor
about the search for a new royal agent?

416
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,720
Whoever it may be,
he is an unlucky bastard.

417
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,850
What if you end up being picked?

418
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,089
Me?

419
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,690
Ten coins for me.

420
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,700
The chief royal secretary is not mad.

421
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:08,970
They only pick the cleanest
and the most inflexible men

422
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,940
to be the royal secret agents.

423
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,410
I will see your ten coins and...

424
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,279
I'm going all-in.

425
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,080
I fold.

426
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,750
I also fold.

427
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:30,390
I am getting a bad feeling.

428
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,930
Fine. Born empty handed,
die empty handed, right?

429
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:35,960
I'm also going all-in.

430
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,830
I am getting a feeling of deja vu.

431
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,450
A royal secret agent should have
a mind as crafty as yours,

432
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,740
don't you agree?

433
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,540
True.

434
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,410
Here comes a crafty man.

435
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,820
Two nines.

436
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,890
If you have two tens, take them.

437
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,430
You look pale.

438
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,890
Do you have two eights?

439
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,330
Oh, he has two eights!

440
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,940
I did it, I did it!

441
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,510
I did it.

442
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,890
I offer my congratulations.

443
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,830
Guard Choi.

444
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,560
Yes.

445
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,570
Take these men
to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

446
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,530
Yes, Lord Jang!

447
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,600
Come with me!

448
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Now!

449
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,940
No...

450
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,480
It was my first win... Dang it.

451
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,520
Here are the reports on Seong Igyeom
you've requested.

452
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,220
He is from Chungcheong-do,
and his father Seong Yongjae

453
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,390
resigned from his chief position
of the Office of Censors

454
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,890
and taught students
at a school in his hometown.

455
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,260
Holding the position of the chief censor
of the Office of Censors

456
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,700
means he had
both knowledge and experience.

457
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,640
Ten years ago...

458
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,210
Prince Hwiyeong might have been
the reason why.

459
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,720
Many government officials were persecuted

460
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,120
because of their connection
to Prince Hwiyeong.

461
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,420
Does he have any other family members?

462
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,860
His wife was ill and died giving birth
to their son Seong Igyeom.

463
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,300
And he has a half-brother

464
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,900
who is a low ranking official
at a government office.

465
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,540
Seong Igyeom currently
lives alone in Hanyang with a servant.

466
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,470
Shall I search his home?

467
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,780
There is no need.

468
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,810
I think I found the man.

469
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,390
The promotion evaluation is near,
so this is a tragedy.

470
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,560
I used to never gamble.

471
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,030
How about me?

472
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,340
I lived my whole life in abstinence.

473
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,740
Just who asked me to do this?

474
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,450
Be glad we are not
in solitary confinement.

475
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,410
Corruption within the palace
means aggravated punishment.

476
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,320
You knew that and still got us involved?

477
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,360
Eunuch Kim!
You won the most money!

478
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,160
He is right!

479
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,430
Eunuch Kim!

480
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,200
Criminal Seong Igyeom, come out.

481
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,340
Did you call for me?

482
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,480
Assistant Advisor Seong Igyeom.

483
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,350
Yes.

484
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,150
You're a little rascal.

485
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,120
I will pay for my sins.

486
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,660
Do you admit your sins?

487
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,900
I have neither a sponsor nor connections,
so what else could I do?

488
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,630
I must pay for it on my own.

489
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,170
Fine.

490
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,870
I will send you outside the palace.

491
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,850
Pay for your sins
by becoming a royal secret agent.

492
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,950
Pardon? A royal secret agent?

493
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,680
Quiet.

494
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,960
I am not the right man for it.

495
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,730
The decision is not up to you.

496
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,270
Lock him up in solitary for now.

497
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,130
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

498
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,440
But...

499
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,610
How can I send a man like him
as my agent?

500
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,650
I served as a proctor of the state exam
a few years ago.

501
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,190
There was an answer sheet
that moved me.

502
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,290
When you read the answer,

503
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,190
you did not hesitate from giving
the highest mark.

504
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,660
What was it about?

505
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,670
It was a passionate critique
on the corrupt and disloyal officials.

506
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,200
Do you remember?

507
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,440
Yes... I do.

508
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,940
It deserved the highest mark.

509
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,050
Seong Igyeom was the man who wrote it.

510
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,380
Is that true?

511
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,420
But... how did such a promising young man
change so much?

512
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,660
I do not know the reason,

513
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,990
but I do think it might be impossible
to find a man

514
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,830
who is perfect.

515
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,830
Seong Igyeom is in jail,
so even if he disappeared,

516
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,900
no one will find out he was dispatched
as a royal secret agent.

517
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,910
What do you need me to do?

518
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,890
Open your eyes.

519
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,160
I will listen so talk.

520
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,700
Insolence! Show proper respect!

521
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,110
Lift your head.

522
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,650
You look familiar...

523
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
Your Majesty!

524
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,560
Your Majesty!

525
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,330
Your Majesty!

526
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,870
Your Majesty.

527
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,340
You and I share the same fate.

528
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,340
Pardon me? I do not understand...

529
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,280
I may be king,

530
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,810
but I am imprisoned.

531
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,190
Those who say they're my loyal servants
have covered my eyes and ears.

532
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,990
They wish for me to remain oblivious
to what is happening in the world.

533
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,130
The only people I can trust in this palace

534
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,640
are the chief royal secretary
and my secret agents.

535
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,710
Will you be my eyes and ears?

536
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,980
Your Majesty!

537
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,780
I am but a lowly man.

538
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,050
I dare not be your eyes and ears.

539
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,660
Give me your trust.

540
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,030
I will give you the power you need.

541
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,130
Free him.

542
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,910
Your Majesty!

543
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,830
From this moment on,
you are my royal secret agent.

544
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,870
Your Majesty...

545
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,350
I will give you three days
until your dispatch.

546
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,020
Recuperate and sort your affairs,

547
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,620
but no one outside must know about this.

548
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,030
Return home and read this.

549
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,260
That is Park Cheolgyu's journal.

550
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,480
Oh, man.

551
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,200
I met a courtesan named Sawol
and learned something new.

552
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,940
Dongsu... Dongsu...

553
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,290
I have decided
to postpone my appearance

554
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,970
and investigate further.

555
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,080
What did Park Cheolgyu learn
from the courtesan?

556
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,290
Chief Royal Secretary.

557
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,190
I hear you have your hands full.

558
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,060
Thank you for your concern.

559
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,430
Did you find a man to be
the next royal agent?

560
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,200
It is not an easy task.

561
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,530
I am sure.

562
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,140
If there is no other,
why not take the job yourself?

563
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,280
I would love to,
but who will look after His Majesty?

564
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:54,450
Are you implying I and other officials
are not looking after His Majesty?

565
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,980
Oh, if it sounded like that, I apologize.

566
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,480
Please do not misunderstand.

567
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,890
Haven't you hear the rumors?

568
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,160
That you send the men His Majesty trusts
as royal agents

569
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,660
to secure your own position.

570
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,000
That is not true.

571
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,900
People's lives are growing harder,

572
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,340
but the government is preoccupied
with the royal agent issue.

573
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,740
I am concerned about
where the blame will fall.

574
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,610
You must show
your concern for the people

575
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:27,450
at the courtesan's house as well.

576
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,990
I have work to do, so please excuse me.

577
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,190
Why that...

578
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,160
The courtesan house? How did he know?

579
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,260
Keep an eye on Chief Royal Secretary

580
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,900
and find how whom he meets
and who visits his house.

581
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Yes, Father.

582
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:00,880
Are you in?

583
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,390
Did you find the person?

584
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,870
I must be at the wrong place.

585
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,340
I will come back another time.

586
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:26,970
Cease her.

587
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,010
Why are you doing this?

588
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,280
What is happening?

589
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,820
I think you have the wrong person.

590
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,820
Please let me talk
to the Chief Royal Secretary.

591
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,750
I have something to tell him.

592
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,690
Be quiet!

593
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,900
Just a moment, please.

594
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,300
I have a favor to ask.

595
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,670
Please tell the Chief Royal Secretary

596
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,310
that Dain is in jail.

597
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,390
I really shouldn't.

598
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,590
That's more expensive than you think.

599
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,870
I am a royal secret agent.

600
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,650
I am Seong Igyeom, a royal secret agent.

601
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,650
That sounds wrong.

602
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,650
You fool!

603
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,920
Do you know who I am?

604
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,790
Me? You're asking about me?

605
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,870
I am a royal secret agent.

606
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,970
This is maddening.
A royal secret agent...

607
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,190
Have you no fear?

608
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,060
How dare you try to look at the records
by bribing a chronicler?

609
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,430
Come with me.

610
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,270
Hostess!

611
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,070
Go and get Honglang!

612
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,440
Oh, geez.

613
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,140
Honglang, Honglang.

614
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,140
Oh, that darn Honglang.

615
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:47,180
If you keep this up, I must report you
to the government office.

616
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,950
What? Report me?

617
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,820
Unbelievable.

618
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,120
Do you know who I am?

619
00:48:58,290 --> 00:48:59,990
How would I know that?

620
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,160
I am!

621
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,070
It's a secret.

622
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,710
I know who he is.
He is a madman.

623
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,680
Sir, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

624
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,580
Chunsam.

625
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,420
Oh, you reek.

626
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,450
Just how much did you drink?

627
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,190
Stand up. We must go.

628
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,720
We must.

629
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,990
What?

630
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,530
Wait.

631
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,200
You must pay first.

632
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:44,910
Chunsam.

633
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:46,570
Yes, sir.

634
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,780
Thank you. I've done nothing for you,

635
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,910
but you're always good to me.

636
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,980
Don't mention it, sir.

637
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,620
All I ask for is to serve one master

638
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,220
until the day I die.

639
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,190
Wherever you go,

640
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:07,160
I will be with you.

641
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,430
So I was thinking, Chunsam.

642
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,260
Yes?

643
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,440
I am a royal secret agent.

644
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,770
A royal secret agent?

645
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,140
Yes.

646
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,710
Now you are a part
of the royal agent's entourage.

647
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,690
Do you mean I will be leaving with you?

648
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:34,520
That is correct.

649
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,030
The royal agent's entourage...

650
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,230
I have always dreamed

651
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,200
of escaping this tiresome servant's life

652
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,740
and living a new one!

653
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,140
But you just said you...

654
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,610
A servant! A servant!

655
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,080
But now I'm a part
of the royal agent's entourage.

656
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,580
Isn't that just wonderful?

657
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,580
Park Chunsam
is in the royal agent's entourage.

658
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:04,750
Are you that happy?

659
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,550
Of course. It's fantastic.

660
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,590
Make way!

661
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,690
Here comes the royal secret agent!

662
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,800
If Lady Sunae knew about this,
she would be happy.

663
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,230
Sunae...

664
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,970
What did you just say?

665
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,480
I did not say Sunae.

666
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,980
No, no, no!

667
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,580
How dare he.

668
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,580
Are you out of your mind?

669
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,350
Why did you do such a thing?

670
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,730
I want to avenge the death of my parents
for they were innocent.

671
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,230
That will only put your life at risk.

672
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,830
Leave this place tomorrow.

673
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,400
Pardon me? Leave?

674
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,300
A royal secret agent will be dispatched
tomorrow morning.

675
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:01,410
Join the royal agent's entourage
and take part in his secret mission.

676
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:06,710
Sir, how can I support the royal agent
when I am a woman?

677
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,550
That is why I am sending you.

678
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:12,790
It is something only you can do
so go with him and help him.

679
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,590
It's something only I can do?

680
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:26,600
What will I get in return?

681
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,770
Are you trying to make a deal with me?

682
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,340
Fine. How much do you want this time?

683
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,150
The man I'm looking for...

684
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:43,380
please find out who the official was.

685
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,750
{\an8}SEONJEONKWAN: GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
THAT DELIVER KING'S ORDERS

686
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,330
How dare you!

687
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,190
Chunsam? Is that you?

688
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,900
Sir? Sir? Sir!

689
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,230
Chunsam! Chunsam!

690
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,470
Sir, sir!

691
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,070
Sir, are you hurt?

692
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:03,770
I'm fine. How about you?

693
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,240
I'm fine too.

694
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,780
But what is going on?

695
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,710
Chunsam is dying here!

696
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:12,550
Stop crying.

697
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:13,550
Chunsam!

698
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:14,980
Stop crying, Park Chunsam!

699
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,250
Calm down.

700
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,190
There is only one way we can get out.

701
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,920
We must find the door.

702
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,530
The door?

703
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,460
Chunsam, stand up.

704
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,770
Use your body to feel things.

705
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,800
Feel things? Feel things.

706
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,840
Up and down.

707
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:38,670
Right and left.

708
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,080
Who's there?

709
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,480
My foot!

710
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,600
This is the door.

711
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,470
Come this way.

712
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,670
Where? Where?

713
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,110
Sir? Sir!

714
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,120
It's me, Chunsam.

715
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,920
Chunsam, Chunsam.

716
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,550
Back up.

717
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,130
Now, we much charge full speed
towards the door.

718
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,830
Yes, got it.

719
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:35,030
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

720
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,300
Are you still here?

721
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,040
You are still here?

722
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,800
You coward.

723
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,670
We will do this for real this time.

724
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:45,470
One!

725
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:46,270
Two!

726
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,010
- Three!
- Three!

727
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,450
What was that sound?

728
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,180
I am not sure.

729
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,380
Was it a thunder?

730
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,320
Pardon me?

731
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:59,920
Let us go.

732
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,190
Sir, sir, we are out!

733
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,830
Who are they?

734
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,200
They're nobodies.
Don't worry about them.

735
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,670
You messed with the wrong man!

736
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,210
The man here is the royal secret agent!

737
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,570
I am the royal secret agent!

738
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,080
You!

739
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:28,480
That is the royal secret agent?

740
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,950
How dare you!

741
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:31,720
Cowards!

742
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,620
No.

743
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,450
Go.

744
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,160
Who's there?

745
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,890
You cowards!

746
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,160
You!

747
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,250
His Majesty warned you
not to reveal your identity!

748
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,420
I hear you drank at the tavern
during midday

749
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,090
and caused a scene at the market.

750
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,960
That was why I ordered you
to be apprehended and locked in the shed.

751
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,860
I apologize, sir.

752
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,190
Had this happened while you were
dispatched as a royal agent,

753
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,830
you could have put

754
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:17,330
His Majesty in danger on top of your life,
can't you see that?

755
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,370
I deserve to be put to death.

756
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,640
No, sir.

757
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,640
This is my fault for not looking
after my master properly.

758
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,980
Please put me to death.

759
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,510
What could I accomplish by killing you?

760
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,550
One more person will join you
on your secret mission.

761
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,160
You leave at dawn. Go home.

762
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,000
She left the Chief Royal Secretary's house
and went to the courtesan house?

763
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,610
Did you see who it was?

764
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:03,210
It was the courtesan who came out
to see you off last time.

765
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,250
She saw you off?

766
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,620
That was Honglang.

767
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,150
She must have acted as a spy.

768
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,790
Bring her here in the morning.

769
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,020
Yes, sir!

770
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,060
Make way! Make way!

771
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,930
Make way! Make way!

772
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,610
Bring out all the courtesans inside!

773
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:38,550
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

774
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:11,580
Wait!

775
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,090
Have you seen the courtesan
named Honglang?

776
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,590
I have not.

777
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,370
Stop right there!

778
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,740
What is this about?

779
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,550
You may fool my eyes,

780
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,450
but you cannot fool my noise.

781
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,330
Honglang.

782
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:05,970
Get her!

783
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,900
{\an8}OPEN AND READ AFTER PASSING NAMDAEMUN

784
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,300
Where you must go and what you must do
are written in detail inside.

785
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,840
And there will be a person
waiting for you at the gate.

786
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,140
Who is it?

787
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,480
At least give me the name.

788
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,110
The name is Hong Dain.

789
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,650
Hong... Dain?

790
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,390
From this moment on,
you are a royal secret agent.

791
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,920
Do not forget your duty.

792
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,290
Yes, Lord Jang.

793
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,400
Make way!

794
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,040
Clear the way!

795
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,650
Sir, the man named Hong Dain
must be running late.

796
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:34,120
Insolence... How dare he make
the royal secret agent wait?

797
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,670
Sir, that must be him. Over there.

798
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,340
So he must know that he's late.

799
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,180
Are you the man
the Chief Royal Secretary sent?

800
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,750
Yes, I am Hong Dain...

801
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,760
The scoundrel?

802
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,290
What? Scoundrel?

803
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,800
You look very...

804
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,500
It's you! Honglang?

805
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,510
So, you are the royal secret agent?

806
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,340
You... You!

807
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,180
There she is. Get her!

808
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:12,175
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

809
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:13,660
<i>This is the place.</i>

810
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:14,970
<i>It seems nothing special.</i>

811
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,240
<i>We'll find out after investigating.</i>

812
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,209
<i>Who is that?</i>

813
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,740
<i>You don't know the Junior Police Chief?</i>

814
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,930
<i>What is "Junior Chief"?</i>

815
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,420
<i>He's the son of the Chief of Police.</i>

816
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,520
<i>In this city, the Junior Chief of Police is king.</i>

817
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:26,070
<i>Special Counsel
investigates father and son.</i>

818
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,080
<i>They must be hiding something.</i>

819
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,350
<i>I need concrete evidence.</i>

820
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,710
<i>You learned something from Sa-wol?</i>

821
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,560
<i>You're Sa-wol, right?</i>

822
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,360
<i>When he saw the son of the Chief of
Police, he shivered with fear and ran away.</i>

823
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,420
<i>There must be a reason.</i>
