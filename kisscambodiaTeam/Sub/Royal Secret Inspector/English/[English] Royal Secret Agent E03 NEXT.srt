1
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,010
Sawol!

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,680
Sawol!

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,510
Sawol, Sawol.

4
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,780
Who's there?

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,020
Stay with me, Sawol.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,390
My baby...
Save my baby, please.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Sawol.

8
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,070
Wake up, Sawol!

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,710
Sawol. Sawol!

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,670
Sir!

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,490
Is anyone there? Open this door!

12
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:09,300
We need help!

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,300
Who's there?

14
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,440
What is the matter?

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,970
There is no time!

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,850
She has lost too much blood.

17
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,850
If we remove the arrow, she may die.

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,230
Please save my baby.

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,370
Go and bring the midwife.

20
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,740
The amniotic sac has ruptured.

21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,070
She is in labor.

22
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,810
There's no time.

23
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,010
She cannot give birth in this state.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,810
Neither the mother
nor the baby will survive.

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,550
Then are you going to just sit and watch?

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,950
Sawol, the baby is coming.

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,090
You must hang in there.

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,660
What are you doing?

29
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,929
I will assist her with childbirth.
Help me get prepared.

30
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,060
Can you do it?

31
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,630
I have never tried it,
but I have assisted before.

32
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,940
Fine.

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,610
Sawol, hang in there.

34
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,190
Not yet. Push!

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,460
Push a little bit harder.

36
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,170
Please... Bury me in that place.

37
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,679
The baby is coming.

38
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,120
Just a little bit more.

39
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,320
Sawol.

40
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,090
It is here.

41
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,100
Sawol.

42
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,900
Sawol, it is a boy.

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,770
Sawol, what did you see?

44
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,280
Why did you take us there?

45
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,750
Sawol.

46
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,540
Sawol.

47
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,640
Sawol.

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,580
Wake up, Sawol.

49
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,250
Sawol!

50
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,150
Sawol!

51
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,850
Sawol...

52
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,470
I share no responsibility
for this woman's death.

53
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,900
This woman was murdered.

54
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,110
That is something you must report
to the government office.

55
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,880
We need your help.

56
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,450
I understand.

57
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,450
It will be daybreak soon so come with me
to the government office.

58
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,650
Thank you.

59
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,040
It's already midday, so where are they?

60
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,410
What if they got into trouble again?

61
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,610
They haven't returned?

62
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,340
No.

63
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,780
I wonder why.

64
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,150
His Majesty will be furious.

65
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,820
I'm the only one
who is fulfilling his duty.

66
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,790
- I need to go out for a while.
- Sure.

67
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,050
- I'll help you later.
- Sure.

68
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,630
What? Why are they back?

69
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,730
Those darn men.

70
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,060
You!

71
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
You!

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,170
You! I warned you
never to show your face here again!

73
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,570
Actually...

74
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,610
Be quiet!

75
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,440
What happened?

76
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,350
It is nothing.

77
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,350
They were asking about you.

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,220
Me?

79
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,250
Yes.

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,550
Sheriff ordered us to bring you
with utmost care.

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,420
Sheriff?

82
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,930
No. Never!

83
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,330
Sir.

84
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,630
- Sir.
- Sir.

85
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,000
If we fail to bring you,

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
we're all dead meat.

87
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,730
So, why did you

88
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,570
summon that courtesan late at night?

89
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,570
I did not summon her.
She paid me a visit.

90
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,340
This courtesan visited you? Why?

91
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,440
She was about to tell me

92
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,340
when an arrow flew in and hit her.

93
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,680
An arrow flew in, you said?

94
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,330
Is this what killed that courtesan?

95
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,360
That's correct.

96
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,360
That's called a steel tip arrow,

97
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,100
and I was told they're made to order.

98
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,570
You will be able to catch the culprit

99
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,610
by getting a list of suspects
who bought the steel tip arrows

100
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,140
from the bow and arrow maker.

101
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,250
This is the arrow you used

102
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,750
when you killed the wild boar, is it not?

103
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,320
If my intention was to kill her,
why would I have gone to the doctor?

104
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,860
She was alive then.
The doctor will confirm it.

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,890
Is he telling the truth?

106
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,260
Yes, he is.

107
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,110
I understand.

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,409
Return home for now.

109
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,649
Once the investigation begins,

110
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:07,580
I will summon you back.

111
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,350
You must find suspects first...

112
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,220
I understand. You may leave.

113
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,210
Thank you for your help.

114
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,810
What is a doctor's job?

115
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,450
I am only disappointed
that I could not save the woman's life.

116
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,120
How did it go?

117
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,390
All I tried to do was to save a life,
but I almost got framed for murder.

118
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,300
What are you going to do with the baby?

119
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,100
What else could we do?

120
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,570
We should look after him
for at least a while.

121
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,570
Give him to me.

122
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,950
Good boy, good boy.

123
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,780
He is hungry.

124
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,380
He needs to be fed.

125
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,630
What are you looking at?

126
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,300
Find someone to nurse him.

127
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,830
I have an urgent business to take care of.

128
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,840
But...

129
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,940
I must pay a visit
to the bow and arrow maker.

130
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,810
Here.

131
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,040
I am going to the courtesan house.

132
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,110
I will feed the baby,

133
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,250
and find out more about Sawol.

134
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,990
Someone may know the identity
of the boy's father.

135
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,620
There must be a reason why
she had to die.

136
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,190
I agree with you.

137
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,390
Stay safe.

138
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,460
Dain!

139
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,060
Yes?

140
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,070
We're finally working as a team.

141
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,240
Haven't you noticed
I've been making all the efforts for that?

142
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,110
How sweet her words are.

143
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,660
Did you get it?

144
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,460
Yes.

145
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,560
These were the officials who belonged
to the Office of Military Staff Guards.

146
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,170
Do you know who was in charge
of escorting Prince Hwiyeong?

147
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,940
Well... I am not sure of that.

148
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,140
Kim Myeongse?

149
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,080
Is this the governor of Jeolla Province
Kim Myeongse?

150
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,520
Yes, that is he.

151
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,390
He is the envy of every young official.

152
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,890
He started to climb up the ladder
about ten years ago

153
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,930
and got rich by serving as an auditor
for two consecutive terms.

154
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,200
I apologize.

155
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,430
But why do you ask?

156
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,040
Good job.

157
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,610
Of course.

158
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,530
Is there something you want to tell me?

159
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,130
You are the one who must talk.

160
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,150
I heard you gave something
to the chief secretary.

161
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,950
Well...

162
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,450
Tell His Lordship this instant!

163
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,920
The Chief Royal Secretary was looking
for a former seonjeonkwan.

164
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,760
So I only gave him a list of names.

165
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
You did not only give it to him.

166
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,500
A military staff guard...

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,040
What was the reason?

168
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,240
I do not know the reason.

169
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,080
You handed over a list of officials
without knowing why?

170
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,350
And you... Received money for it?

171
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,420
Well, I...

172
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,720
I have committed a grave sin!

173
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,430
It is only grave if you stay silent.

174
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,660
Tell me.

175
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,100
What else did you talk about?

176
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,870
He asked which man on the list
escorted P-Prince Hwiyeong,

177
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,010
and I told him I did not know.

178
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,480
That is all!

179
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,140
Prince Hwiyeong?

180
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,720
Please wait here for a moment.

181
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,420
Sure.

182
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,240
You've gone mad!

183
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,480
On top of impersonating a royal agent,
you're meeting the Sheriff?

184
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,380
Chunsam, if Lord Igyeom finds out...

185
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,820
Welcome.

186
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,060
It is an honor to have you as my guest.

187
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,800
I am Kang Inchung,
the sheriff of this town.

188
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,330
Good.

189
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,540
You asked to see me?

190
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,810
Being a royal agent is difficult,
and it does not pay well.

191
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,180
Now that you are in my town,
you must give me a chance to treat you.

192
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,110
Treat me?

193
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,060
This is not much, but please accept it.

194
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,900
What is this?

195
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,040
Isn't this gold?

196
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,710
Please put in a good word for me
with His Majesty.

197
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,440
Forget it.

198
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,180
Gold to me is like stone!

199
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,850
That is even better.

200
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,650
What?

201
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,150
Pretend those are pieces of stone
and take them, won't you?

202
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,590
I am not mad, so how could I?

203
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,790
These are pieces of stone, stone.

204
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,410
These are pieces of stone.
These are pieces of stone.

205
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,810
It's gold.

206
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,700
Are you here to order a bow?

207
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,310
What are you doing? Why?

208
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,000
Are you in?

209
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:50,370
My good man!

210
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,010
Wake up!

211
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,990
Thank you.

212
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,760
Oh, how precious.

213
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,360
Where did you find this infant?

214
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,960
- What a sweet creature.
- He is adorable.

215
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,630
May I hold him?

216
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,870
Obviously someone abandoned him
because they didn't want to raise him.

217
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,000
Like you?

218
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,910
Be quiet, girls. He might hear you.

219
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,110
He's Sawol's baby.

220
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,250
Where is Sawol?

221
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,680
I-Is she dead?

222
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,520
She was a good girl.

223
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,830
This is all his doing.

224
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,260
This is all whose doing?

225
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,970
Are you serious?

226
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,570
Fine!

227
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,010
We call that man the Little Sheriff.

228
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,650
The Little Sheriff? Kang Jonggil?

229
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,890
How could a pregnant courtesan
stay at the courtesan house?

230
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,590
He made sure Sawol could stay here.

231
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,990
His father would have been furious
had he found out,

232
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,490
so he hid her here.

233
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,800
Look after the baby.

234
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,270
If he cries, feed him.

235
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,120
Are you in?

236
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,450
Are you in there?

237
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,860
Sir, what brings you back here?

238
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,900
Take it.

239
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,400
Pardon me?

240
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,970
Take it.

241
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,810
What is this?

242
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,750
Open it.

243
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,430
This is gold.

244
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,890
You are correct.

245
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,030
This is too much.

246
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,900
No, thank you.

247
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,610
With this, you won't go hungry again.

248
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,080
Take it for the sake of your boys.

249
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,590
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,490
Get back to what you were doing.

251
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,230
Goodbye.

252
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,930
Lord Seong, I am glad you are here.
I have something to tell...

253
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,100
The bow and arrow maker is dead.

254
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,270
What?

255
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,210
The man who killed Sawol is destroying
any and all evidence.

256
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,880
Do you have an idea whom it might be?

257
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,580
He is an expert archer.

258
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,980
How many man could there be in this town

259
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,650
who uses a custom-made bow
and can hit a target in the dark?

260
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,320
Kang Jonggil?

261
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,250
Yes.

262
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,820
But something is odd.

263
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,790
How could he kill a woman
carrying his child?

264
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,790
What?

265
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,030
Sawol was pregnant
with Kang Jonggil's child.

266
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,400
Let us talk inside.

267
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,280
So why did he kill Sawol?

268
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,690
Sawol knew something
about the previous royal secret agent.

269
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,620
When she tried to tell us, he killed her.

270
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,330
Our only witness is dead.

271
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,590
What horrible thing could he have done

272
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,760
to kill the woman
who was carrying his child to hide it?

273
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,930
The royal secret agent?

274
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,940
Kang Jonggil becomes disgusting
when he gets drunk,

275
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,840
so Sawol always dealt with him.

276
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,510
She could have heard something
about the royal secret agent.

277
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,880
He says all sorts of things
when he gets drunk.

278
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,180
When he's inebriated,
he will even criticize his own father,

279
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,150
so if you nudged him a bit,
he might tell you something.

280
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,820
You mean ask him directly?

281
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,760
Yes.

282
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,160
Let me try it.

283
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,230
No.

284
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,530
No?

285
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,370
The risk is too high because
we do not know how he might react.

286
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,500
But this is the quickest way.

287
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,000
Alcohol is best for finding out
how one feels inside.

288
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,740
Do you think he will tell you?

289
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,640
I am Honglang.

290
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,280
Winning over a man's heart
is like taking candy from a baby.

291
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,880
Do you think all men are that simple?

292
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,350
Some men are like me.

293
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,930
W-What are you doing?

294
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,060
What are you trying to do?

295
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,400
With you, it's not that I have failed.

296
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,700
I chose not to.

297
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,740
Do you think I would fall for you?

298
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,280
The Little Sheriff is here.

299
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,180
Do not get yourself in trouble.

300
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,600
We meet again, sir.

301
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,380
Sir, let me pour you a drink.

302
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,130
This tastes especially sweet tonight.

303
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,140
Sir.

304
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,040
She's having fun, isn't she?

305
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,410
Please stop.

306
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,510
Stay still.

307
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,170
Sawol is dead, I hear.

308
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,070
Yes.

309
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,470
Do you know who killed her?

310
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,810
How would I know?

311
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,520
Yes, she got herself killed.

312
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,150
What do you mean?

313
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,160
How dare she be in league
with a royal agent?

314
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,030
Sawol was in league with a royal agent?

315
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,540
Where were you last night?

316
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,240
I was here.

317
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,380
Liar.

318
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,110
Tell me what you saw.

319
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,590
Sir, I do not understand what you're...

320
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,590
You've been in league
with a royal agent as well!

321
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,370
You filthy bastard.

322
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,500
Tell me, why did you kill Sawol?

323
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,270
You are meddling.

324
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,210
Do you wish to end up like him?

325
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,210
Did you kill the royal secret agent?

326
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,750
Tell me. I asked you if you killed him.

327
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,560
Do you think I killed him?

328
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,230
Then try to prove it.

329
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,430
You!

330
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,470
Lord Seong.

331
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,570
Come.

332
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,740
Sir.

333
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,550
Get them!

334
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,120
That way! Get them!

335
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,950
Get them, get them!

336
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,230
This way.

337
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,050
Take him to a safe place.

338
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,450
Thank you.

339
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,580
Go.

340
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,690
Go to the tavern and see Chunsam.

341
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,890
What about you?

342
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,990
You go ahead.

343
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,490
I refuse to go alone.

344
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,960
I will catch up with you soon.

345
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,170
I will hold you to that.

346
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,030
Of course.

347
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,590
So, who's first?

348
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,430
What are you waiting for? Get him!

349
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,100
Hey, this is cheating.

350
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,460
Lady Dain, what happened?

351
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,430
Where is Lord Seong?
Why do you have a baby?

352
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,400
Take him.

353
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,070
Whose baby is this?

354
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,500
It's a long story.

355
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,870
Let me catch my breath.

356
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,340
Where is Lord Seong?

357
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,680
He is fighting with Kang Jonggil's men.

358
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,610
What?

359
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,280
But what if something happens to him?

360
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,750
Don't worry about him.

361
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,950
You don't know him well enough,

362
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,220
but growing up,
he was the best fighter in his town.

363
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,100
Instead of studying, he practiced
martial arts with his younger brother.

364
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,080
I'm sure many of them are hurt by now.

365
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,070
If you kill me,

366
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,040
you won't make it out of here alive.

367
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,940
Kill you?

368
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,510
Do you think I would make it that easy?

369
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,480
I will make sure you live in pain
for the rest of your life.

370
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,020
You won't get away with this!

371
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,490
I will remember this!

372
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,870
How did he place first on the state exam
if all he did was fight?

373
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:41,040
Lady Dain, once a man
finds love in his heart,

374
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,710
he can do anything.

375
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,650
He fell in love?

376
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,450
Yes.

377
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,250
But that was how the tragedy began.

378
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,660
Tragedy? What do you mean?

379
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,530
Nothing happened.

380
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Tell me.

381
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,570
So Lord Seong is...

382
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,640
You're back.

383
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,570
Sir, how are you feeling?

384
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,070
Are you hurt?

385
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,640
Don't worry.

386
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,750
If there is one thing I hate,
it is getting beaten by someone.

387
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,650
Let us go inside.

388
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,990
I haven't done this in a while,
so I ache everywhere.

389
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,500
Where does it hurt?

390
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,330
Let me see.

391
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,100
Ouch.

392
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,010
Why did you get involved?

393
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,110
I have my own ways
of taking care of things.

394
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,410
I regret not beating them even more.

395
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,650
How could you say that
when you are hurt?

396
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,020
If I am in this state,
imagine the kind of state they must be in.

397
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,550
Are you inside?

398
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,860
Who could that be?

399
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,660
Maybe it's someone Kang Jonggil sent.

400
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,460
I will go and check.

401
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,430
Who's there?

402
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,870
Oh! Madam, what are you doing here?

403
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,410
Madam?

404
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,010
I thought about it,

405
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,880
and I must return this to you.

406
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,720
Don't.

407
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,720
I am with him.

408
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,390
What did you come here to return?

409
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,130
Sir.

410
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,500
Your kindness is enough for me.

411
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,880
Please take good care of him.

412
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,800
I was going to tell you, but...

413
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,400
What is this?

414
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,830
Please calm down.

415
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,010
Actually, I got them from Kang Inchung.

416
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,850
What?

417
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,350
Please let him explain.

418
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,850
Tell us the truth.

419
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,290
What happened while we were gone?

420
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,190
I deserve to die, sir.

421
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,100
I impersonated a royal agent.

422
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,170
And I accepted the bribe
the Sheriff offered.

423
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,470
I am sorry.

424
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,410
What? A bribe?

425
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,340
It wasn't for me.

426
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,680
A widow and her children were starving,

427
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,710
so I had no choice but to...

428
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,020
Sir, please calm down.

429
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,580
How dare you accept a bribe?

430
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,060
Sir.

431
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:25,609
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

432
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,320
How are you feeling?

433
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,690
I'm sorry, Lady Dain.

434
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,460
I deserved it.

435
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,860
Let me see your face.

436
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,600
No, I am fine.

437
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,699
Let me see.

438
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,440
That looks painful.

439
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,010
You are the only one who cares for me.

440
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,010
Tell me the rest of the story.

441
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,949
What story?

442
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,550
That tragedy.

443
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,889
What happened
after Lord Seong fell in love?

444
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:31,060
He was happy.

445
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,400
But it was brief.

446
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,840
Lord Seong had to leave
to take the state exam,

447
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,970
and the two of them had to part.

448
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:52,050
But I heard Lord Seong
won the highest honor.

449
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,520
He did.

450
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,390
But when he returned,
everything was different.

451
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,290
Sir!

452
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,260
Wait, sir!

453
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,000
Lady Sunae was imprisoned,

454
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,270
but Lord Seong's younger brother
who was working at the government office

455
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,170
took her and fled with her.

456
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,540
Shoot them!

457
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,980
Sunae!

458
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,460
Sunae!

459
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,700
Sunae!

460
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,500
Get them!

461
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,250
Get them!

462
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,020
Sir!

463
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,590
Sir!

464
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,630
Don't shoot.

465
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,630
What are you doing?

466
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,500
Get him out of my way.

467
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,370
Wait!

468
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,080
Why was Lord Seong's beloved imprisoned?

469
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,290
According to rumors,
Lady Sunae began seducing men in town.

470
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,320
after Lord Seong left.

471
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,190
And she was imprisoned because of that.

472
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,300
One of those men was
Lord Seong's younger brother.

473
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,940
So Lord Seong's beloved
and his younger brother were intimate?

474
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,540
I haven't seen them since then,

475
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,040
so there is no way to confirm that.

476
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,010
Now there are just rumors.

477
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,250
How could that be?

478
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,420
After that day,
he became a completely different man.

479
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,060
Lady Dain!

480
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,930
Where are you going?

481
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,730
I'm alone again.

482
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,190
Why did I bring that fool with me?

483
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,460
How dare he impersonate a royal agent

484
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,230
and accept a bribe?

485
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,490
Gosh! I am furious.

486
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

487
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,710
It's nothing.

488
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,120
You are a good man.

489
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,360
Are you drunk?

490
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,660
If it hadn't been for you,
I would've gotten killed.

491
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,030
Thank you.

492
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,440
Oh, that.

493
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,410
It is too soon to thank me.

494
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,380
We still have much work to do.

495
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,260
Sir!

496
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,930
I deserve to die.

497
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,840
Stand up.

498
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,810
Pardon me?

499
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,790
Sir.

500
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,330
Sir.

501
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,570
You are...

502
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,640
Fired from the royal agent's entourage.

503
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,610
Pardon me?

504
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,380
And the moment we return to Hanyang,

505
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,240
you will be punished for your crimes.

506
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,150
Sir!

507
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,590
Lord Seong, Chunsam made a mistake,

508
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,690
but he is regretting it.

509
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,790
Please show mercy.

510
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,720
Separating public and private businesses

511
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,760
is a virtue every royal agent must have.

512
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,930
I came to punish corrupt officials,

513
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,700
but my own man has committed a crime,

514
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,740
so I must punish him accordingly.

515
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,970
Sir.

516
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,220
When that imbecile

517
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,020
claimed he was a royal secret agent,

518
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,860
Kang Inchung bribed him
instead of killing him.

519
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,030
So why did he have to kill Park Cheolgyu?

520
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,500
There must be

521
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,320
something bigger they're trying to hide,

522
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,370
on top the death of a royal agent.

523
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,020
Is anyone there?

524
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:11,990
Father.

525
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,570
Did you play another hunting game
with the prisoners?

526
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,100
He had committed kangsangjoe,

527
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,870
and deserved to be beheaded.

528
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,770
What?

529
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,880
How could you do something that insane

530
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,680
when we need every manpower we can find?

531
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,620
Go to the next town
and bring back laborers.

532
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,820
Do you understand?

533
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,650
Yes.

534
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,900
He is burning up.

535
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,700
He doesn't look very well.

536
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,770
Baby, if you are sick,
tell us here it hurts.

537
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,110
This must be a very serious illness,

538
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,550
or he couldn't be crying so hard.

539
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,250
We better take him to see a doctor.

540
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,890
Doctor, please take a look at this baby.

541
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,530
Oh, it's you.

542
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,160
But I have an urgent patient.

543
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,300
Take a second and look at him.

544
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,170
You are the one who saved his life.

545
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,240
Let me see him.

546
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:49,390
Lower his temperature by putting
a piece of cold cloth over his forehead,

547
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,660
and feed him when he wakes up.

548
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,490
Is that all?

549
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,160
He was crying as if he was dying.

550
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,600
That is how all babies do.

551
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,340
His mother's dying wish
was for us to save him,

552
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,570
so he won't die that easily.

553
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,380
That little guy almost gave me
a heart attack.

554
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,910
Sawol's dying wish. Her last words.

555
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,320
Please... Bury me in that place.

556
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,590
Sir, what's wrong?

557
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,390
There must be a reason why
Sawol asked us to bury her in that place.

558
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,300
I need to visit the forest.

559
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,930
Sir.

560
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,060
I will go.

561
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,570
I will go too.

562
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,030
No, Chunsam, you stay here
and look after the baby.

563
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,000
But... Lady Dain!

564
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,110
What are you doing?
The baby is crying.

565
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,710
But... But...

566
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,750
I'm not a nurse.

567
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,650
Oh, it's okay.

568
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,990
All finished.

569
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,690
How do you feel?

570
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,990
I feel much better.

571
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,960
Next time, be punctual.

572
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,500
I apologize.

573
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,300
People brought in a baby all of a sudden.

574
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,440
You must know too.

575
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,710
The courtesan who was killed
by an arrow,

576
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,450
it was her baby.

577
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:21,150
What do you mean?

578
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,850
That girl died.

579
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,220
Yes, she died.

580
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,490
But she gave birth just before her death.

581
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,930
I used every medical techniques I have
to save that baby.

582
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,830
Is that true?

583
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,470
That baby is alive?

584
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,370
Yes.

585
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,000
He is such a handsome boy.

586
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,640
Where is the man who brought the baby?

587
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,650
Bury her here?

588
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,520
Get rid of him.

589
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,420
Come.

590
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,660
Move them here.

591
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,270
What are you doing here?

592
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,510
Do you know that royal agent?

593
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,190
I asked if you know him!

594
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,020
He said he would find my little brother.

595
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,560
You were in league with the royal agent.

596
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,900
I am with child!

597
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,040
I am with your... Child.

598
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,840
Sir, what's wrong?

599
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,700
Special Advisor Park.

600
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,410
Special Advisor Park!

601
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,550
Special Advisor Park...

602
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,460
You dug your own grave.

603
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,630
I will bury you here, as you wish.

604
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,870
You! Do you not fear the punishment?

605
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,000
How dare you raise your voice to me?

606
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,210
Take them to the government office!

607
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,340
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

608
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:39,970
Dain!

609
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:40,870
Lord Seong!

610
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,420
Oh, how can a little guy like this
poo like a horse?

611
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,930
Are you smiling?

612
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,700
I want to cry.

613
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,700
I will wash this clean. Just wait.

614
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,310
What's that?

615
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,750
He always gets himself into trouble
whenever I'm not looking.

616
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:58,110
The man who brought you
to the Office of Special Advisors

617
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,150
was me.

618
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,650
I was very impressed

619
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,320
by your confidence even in the presence

620
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,550
of me and other officials
when I first met you.

621
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,990
You never cease to impress me.

622
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,700
The rumors of your self-indulgent
lifestyle, drinking every day,

623
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,200
were true.

624
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,400
What happened to the man
who placed first on the state exam?

625
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,570
I was wrong about you.

626
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:28,110
How can you trust people?

627
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:31,650
People are the one thing
you should never trust.

628
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,050
Seong Igyeom.

629
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,660
Do you know why a country falls?

630
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,030
It is because people stop believing
in their country

631
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:54,770
once they witness officials like you.

632
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,410
Lord Seong.

633
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,350
Lord Seong.

634
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,150
What is it?

635
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,760
Don't lose faith until tomorrow.

636
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,490
Tomorrow?

637
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:18,860
What is happening tomorrow?

638
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:22,730
Royal Guard Choi is coming.

639
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,070
What do you mean? I was never told.

640
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,570
Well, he is not coming here to see you.

641
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,340
Anyway, when he arrives tomorrow,

642
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,610
he will become suspicious of my absence

643
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,110
and come looking for us.

644
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,750
Tell me the whole story.

645
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:44,650
Why is Royal Guard Choi coming
to see you without my knowledge?

646
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,690
Are you keeping something from me?

647
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,400
Well...

648
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:00,000
I was ordered to report your activities.

649
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,470
What?

650
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,870
You were spying on me?

651
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,210
I wouldn't call it that.

652
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,440
That means you did not trust me.

653
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,050
Chunsam stabbed me in the back
and now you.

654
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,680
I cannot trust anyone.

655
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,020
I had no choice.

656
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,090
You were a scoundrel before.

657
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,820
What? A scoundrel?

658
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,230
But things are not that bad now.

659
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,170
So I should be grateful?

660
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:38,210
When Royal Guard Choi arrives tomorrow...

661
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,080
We will be dead by then.

662
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,980
I got stabbed so hard
that I am fully alert.

663
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,380
I have a clever idea.

664
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,090
Is anyone there?

665
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,420
Anyone! Help me! Please!

666
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,460
What is all the ruckus?

667
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,230
Help, please. He is dying.

668
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:13,580
What is wrong with him?

669
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,310
It looks like diabetes.

670
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,410
He may die without treatment.

671
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:19,380
Please take him to a doctor.

672
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,850
Hurry!

673
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:21,680
Just wait.

674
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,250
Oh, he's dying!

675
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,560
Oh, poor man!

676
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:36,500
Who knew he would die so far from home?

677
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh, how tragic!

678
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,040
I found it.

679
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,080
Why aren't you opening the door?

680
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,180
That's enough.

681
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:51,810
What?

682
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,120
He is going to die in the morning.

683
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,620
So this is better.

684
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,420
This is a thousand times better
than getting his head chopped off.

685
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,190
Wait!

686
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,120
How could you be so cold?

687
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,230
Even if he is going to die tomorrow,
he should receive treatment!

688
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,700
Wait! Don't go!

689
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,070
Is he gone?

690
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:17,870
He's gone.

691
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,480
Was that your clever idea?

692
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,950
The guard fell for my acting.

693
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,690
Had your performance been better,
it would have worked.

694
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,090
I have been making a living being a spy,

695
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,500
so how could you criticize my performance?

696
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,600
I could have done a better job than you
with just one foot.

697
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:51,010
Is he gone?

698
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,370
What was that?

699
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:53,810
I didn't do it like that!

700
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,880
This is how you do it!

701
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:03,550
That's enough.

702
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,450
Oh! If Chunsam were here,
I would be out by now.

703
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,260
You call that acting?

704
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,530
Oh, he's dying!

705
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:11,830
Unbelievable.

706
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,300
Are you home?

707
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,630
Are you inside?

708
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,930
Sir.

709
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,270
I have a favor to ask.

710
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,810
I am desperate.

711
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,250
Could you please look after this baby
for just a while?

712
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,350
I know I am asking too much,

713
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,880
but I have urgent business.

714
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,320
I will.

715
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,520
Let me have him.

716
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,290
What is the baby's name?

717
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:45,060
Name?

718
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,900
He doesn't have a name yet.

719
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,500
I see.

720
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,100
I will take good care of him.

721
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,270
Thank you.

722
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,380
You're not curious?

723
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,710
Why won't you ask me anything?

724
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,310
I wouldn't dare

725
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,550
ask about what you do.

726
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:14,220
If I could be of any help to you,

727
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,260
I will happily oblige.

728
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,030
But I have a favor to ask of you too.

729
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:25,770
Tell me what it is.

730
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:27,970
You must come back,

731
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,740
and give this baby a name.

732
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,850
I will do that.

733
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,410
Goodbye.

734
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:45,090
Who are you?

735
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,260
Here.

736
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:48,620
Magistrate!

737
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,120
Magistrate!

738
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,330
Oh!
My Lord!

739
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,870
I have not heard from you,

740
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:58,700
so I assumed you went back to Hanyang.

741
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,640
I came because I heard members
of my entourage were imprisoned here.

742
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,210
Where is everyone?

743
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,780
Where are the prisoners?

744
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,650
It was the little sheriff.

745
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:17,890
The little sheriff?

746
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:22,520
Young Lord ordered them to be taken
to the hunting ground.

747
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,760
What?

748
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,030
This place is...

749
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,200
What's the matter?

750
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,640
You've come.

751
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,040
Why do you look so surprised?

752
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,340
This isn't your first time here.

753
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,980
Why did you bring us here?

754
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:46,650
Don't you already know?

755
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,750
So I can go hunting.

756
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,620
What is he talking about?

757
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,060
We are his prey.

758
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:57,790
What?

759
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:06,570
Killing us will not make
your despicable crimes disappear.

760
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,900
You are brazen.

761
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:16,380
Would you rather die after being tortured?

762
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:21,280
I have a special torture for girls.

763
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,790
Put that hand on her

764
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:30,730
and you will never be able to use it again
as long as you shall live.

765
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,530
You are quite brave
for a man facing death.

766
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,370
Which of you will go first?

767
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,440
I will go first.

768
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,010
No, Lord Seong.

769
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,510
I will go first.

770
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:52,150
Sure. It is better to get it over with,

771
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:54,680
so you go first.

772
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,390
What?

773
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,290
Dain.

774
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,660
Yes?

775
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:05,890
Run in a zigzag pattern.

776
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,500
You'll be able to buy time.

777
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,000
Even so, death would be inevitable.

778
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,600
Everyone dies someday.

779
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,510
And that day is today?

780
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,980
I said I didn't want to join
the royal agent's entourage,

781
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,850
so why did he send me here?

782
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,620
Dain, do not forget what I said.

783
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,560
What are you waiting for?

784
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,490
Bring her.

785
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,570
Go ahead, run.

786
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,940
Hurry!

787
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,350
Do you really think you can stay alive
running so slowly?

788
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:18,976
How interesting.

789
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:05,101
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

790
01:02:05,149 --> 01:02:06,250
<i>Where is Lord Seong?</i>

791
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,780
<i>I sent him to Hwaeomsan.</i>

792
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,320
<i>You only brought two.</i>

793
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,590
<i>Only two?</i>

794
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:13,720
<i>They are fit and strong,
enough to replace a hundred...</i>

795
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,320
<i>You aren't humans here.
You guys are insects.</i>

796
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:16,990
<i>Insects?</i>

797
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:18,329
<i>This insect has a question.</i>

798
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,200
<i>There must be a way to escape from here.</i>

799
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,060
<i>What? How?</i>

800
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,630
<i>You must go and rescue the royal agent.</i>

801
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,870
<i>I cannot go without an order.</i>

802
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,500
<i>If His Majesty tells you to die, will you?</i>

803
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,100
<i>If that is what His Majesty wishes...</i>

804
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,970
<i>Chunsam, draw your sword.</i>

805
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:30,840
<i>Maybe I will bite the hand that feeds me.</i>

806
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,110
<i>I'll be that dog today.</i>
