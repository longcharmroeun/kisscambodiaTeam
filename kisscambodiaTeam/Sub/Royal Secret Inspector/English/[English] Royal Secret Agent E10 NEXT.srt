{\an8}EPISODE 10

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,770
Take off her mask,

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,740
and I will raise it to 300.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,510
We will start again at 300 coins.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,120
What are you doing?

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,030
Keep her as your concubine

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,100
or just get rid of her
after playing with her.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,440
I will buy her for 500 coins.

9
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,670
Anyone else?

10
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,350
One, two, three!

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,750
Sold!

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,700
Will you come with me?

13
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,800
No.

14
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,240
I paid a handsome price for you,

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,210
so you better be worth it.

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,279
What are you doing? Let go of me!

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,350
I heard a royal secret agent is in town.

18
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,860
A royal agent?

19
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,920
So what? Who cares?

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,300
Rumor has it that
if you just feed him a hearty meal,

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,300
he'll become grateful
and even hand over his horse tablet.

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,870
What are you waiting for?
Pour me a drink.

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,850
Where are you going?

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Who are you?

25
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:02,379
Me?

26
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,390
I am the royal secret agent!

27
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,060
Stop him!

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Lord Seong!

29
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,510
Where are you going?

30
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,540
Let go of me!

31
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,860
Sir!

32
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,290
Sir!

33
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,260
Sir!

34
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,270
Chunsam! Now!

35
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,670
Get them!

36
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,370
Here comes the royal secret agent!

37
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,870
Apprehend them!

38
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,850
Take the guards and apprehend
those still inside.

39
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,650
Yes. This way.

40
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,560
I must find Sunae.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
What?

42
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,690
Sir!

43
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,120
What is it?

44
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,230
The royal secret agent is here.

45
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,830
You must leave.

46
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,900
What? The royal secret agent?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
My Lady! Lady Sunae!

48
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,110
Sir! Over there! Over there!

49
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,720
Stop right there!

50
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,320
Stop right there!

51
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,350
Stop right there!

52
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,120
You stopped.

53
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,459
My Lady.

54
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,870
I will knock you down and rescue her.

55
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,380
Chunsam, are you all right?

56
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,680
That way.

57
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,350
Lady Sunae went that way!

58
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,990
My heart.

59
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,170
Lord Ibeom.

60
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,650
What are you doing here?

61
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,220
Lady Sunae...

62
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,350
Did you see her?

63
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,690
Yes, but...

64
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,560
Ibeom.

65
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,460
Igyeom.

66
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,360
Why was Sunae here?

67
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,840
Why did you fail to protect her?

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,540
Where is she right now?

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,990
If you want to find her,
come with me.

70
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,840
This is the one who tried
to have his way with me.

71
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
That hurt.

72
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,650
You were hiding here.

73
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,130
You know, don't you?

74
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,160
Who was that with a dokkebi mask?

75
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,500
Where is he right now?

76
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,870
I do not understand
a word you are saying, sir.

77
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,270
Send a message to my house.

78
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,170
My father will be enraged.

79
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,280
Do you even know who these people are?

80
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,570
Tell him to stop!

81
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,670
I cannot do that.

82
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Help!

83
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,150
Tell me.

84
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,920
Stop.

85
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,430
I have an idea.

86
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,130
The man who is always with him
is not here.

87
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,160
It's Kim Daegwang.

88
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,470
Darn it. You should've said it sooner.

89
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,940
Dain and Chunsam, take these men
to the government office.

90
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,770
Yes, sir.

91
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,380
And you, come with me.

92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,190
Open the door!

93
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,190
Who is it?

94
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,730
- What are you doing?
- What is this about?

95
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,200
Where is Kim Daegwang?

96
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,530
What is this about?

97
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,000
I am fine.

98
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,170
You are...

99
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,510
I am here for your son.

100
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,250
Daegwang?

101
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,850
For what reason?

102
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,790
Your son is responsible for all the women
who were killed in this town.

103
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,660
Did you come to my house
to accuse my son of murder again?

104
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,560
Kim Daegwang, Park Wumin, and Jeong Munho
did it together.

105
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,200
What?

106
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
If it is difficult to believe,
go to the government office.

107
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,900
His accomplices have been apprehended.

108
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,710
Now will you tell me where your son is?

109
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,450
He said he was going to the lecture hall.

110
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,820
My son is not capable of such acts.

111
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,660
The others must have tempted him,
so please show him mercy.

112
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,510
Kim Daegwang may come back,
so I will stay close and keep watch.

113
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,650
Good. I will go to the government office.

114
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,450
Igyeom.

115
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,060
I am sorry I failed to protect Sunae.

116
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,800
I failed to protect you.

117
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,960
Twist their legs!

118
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,860
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

119
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,810
Stop!

120
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,950
Where is the leader of your group?

121
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,320
How could we possibly know that?

122
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,850
We know nothing.

123
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,960
How dare you!
You are still resisting.

124
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,120
Guards!

125
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,930
Magistrate!

126
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,490
Magistrate!

127
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,660
What is it?

128
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,500
I think something happened.

129
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,700
Is that true?

130
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,600
Yes.

131
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,410
Kim Daegwang is dead.

132
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,310
What?

133
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,750
What did you say?

134
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,730
I thought he was a good man,

135
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,930
but he practiced lustful acts.

136
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,230
Take his body to the government office.

137
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,040
Yes, sir. Take down the body.

138
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,340
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,740
Search this area.

140
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,180
He took a woman with him.

141
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,310
Yes, Lord Seong.

142
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,080
Search this area thoroughly
and report when you find traces of a person.

143
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

144
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,320
What is that?

145
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,690
Let us go.

146
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,520
Yes.

147
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,240
Lady Dain, this was on the ground
just over there.

148
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,850
Wait.

149
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,990
What is it?

150
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,550
I need to check the body.

151
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,120
What?

152
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,660
What is it?

153
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,660
How odd.

154
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,130
What is?

155
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,100
Look. If he had committed suicide,

156
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,170
the ligature mark would be diagonal,

157
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,540
across the center of the neck
going up toward the earlobe.

158
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,940
But for this man, it is horizontal.

159
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,550
That was probably because
he was struggling hard.

160
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,990
It's blood.

161
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,070
Lord Seong!

162
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,130
Lord Seong.

163
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,400
What is it?

164
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,340
Something bothers me.

165
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,370
Bothers you?

166
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,410
I found evidence of murder.

167
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,940
Murder? is that true?

168
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,580
Yes, his head has a scar
from a blunt force trauma.

169
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,720
Someone knocked him out
with a blunt object,

170
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,350
made him defenseless, and killed him
by strangling him with a rope.

171
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,090
Who would do such a thing?

172
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,390
We will find out when we investigate.

173
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
Lord Seong, I found the suicide note.

174
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,140
And we also found this.

175
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,080
I regret all my crimes.
I will take my own life.

176
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,450
There is no mention of a woman.

177
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,560
Lord Seong, I will take the suicide note
and compare it with his handwriting.

178
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,390
There is no need.

179
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,230
I have sent a man to Lord Kim's house.

180
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,530
Where did you find this?

181
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,600
Over there.

182
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's go see.

183
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,450
Oh, my heart!

184
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,550
Lady Dain, did I scare you?

185
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,790
How dare you!

186
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,990
Wait.

187
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,470
I have a plan.

188
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,100
Chunsam, I owe it all to you.

189
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,440
To me?

190
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,970
Come. I have something I want to check.

191
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,070
Again?

192
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,940
Lady Dain.

193
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,280
Is this the place?

194
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,750
Yes, it is.

195
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,460
Keep searching.
I must go back to the government office.

196
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,130
I keep thinking
about the evidence of murder,

197
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,860
so I want to go and check the body.

198
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,530
Yes, Lord Seong.

199
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,510
What brings you here?

200
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,010
I am here under the order
of the royal agent.

201
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,280
Bring the tortured prisoners
to Bugeundang.

202
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,590
Prisoners Jeong Munho and Park Wumin,
come out.

203
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,890
I knew it.

204
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,590
I was wondering why he ignored us.

205
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,500
We brought them.

206
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,460
What happened to the royal agent?

207
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,760
Is he leaving soon?

208
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,659
Will you let us go once he leaves,
as you promised?

209
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:46,070
If only that royal agent
hadn't come to this town...

210
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,330
I expected you to just pretend
when you tortured us,

211
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,470
but it was unbearable.

212
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,840
Are you going to let
that royal agent run wild?

213
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,740
We will get rid of him
without anyone's knowledge,

214
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,540
so make your decision, Magistrate.

215
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,980
I will make my decision.

216
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,420
You.

217
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,290
Was this the magistrate's doing?

218
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,040
Chunsam.

219
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Yes.

220
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,810
Report this to the royal agent.

221
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,910
Yes.

222
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,050
What is this?

223
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,990
What are you doing?

224
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,800
If you had left quietly,
you could have stayed alive.

225
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,670
Where is the royal agent?

226
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,770
Lord Igyeom!

227
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,840
Lord Igyeom!

228
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,380
Lord Igyeom!

229
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,050
Sunae? Is that you, Sunae?

230
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,620
I've finally found you.

231
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,960
Are you all right?

232
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,930
What happened?

233
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,000
Keep searching.
I must go back to the government office.

234
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,820
It was him.

235
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,790
What are you waiting for? Shoot them!

236
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,750
Stop!

237
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,590
Who are you?

238
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,630
Listen carefully.

239
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,930
The government office is surrounded
by the royal agent's men.

240
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,600
Why do you want to go down for the crimes
your corrupt sheriff committed?

241
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,010
Those who put down their bow will live,
but if you fail to do so,

242
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,180
you will be punished for treason
for killing the royal agent's entourage

243
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,150
who receive orders from His Majesty.

244
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,490
What are you waiting for?

245
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,720
I said, shoot them!

246
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,620
No use.

247
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,300
You...

248
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,570
Get him!

249
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,580
You need to come with me.

250
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,650
He went in there so call the guards.

251
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,190
There are no guards.

252
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,230
They went home after they transported
the prisoners to the government office.

253
00:19:59,230 --> 00:19:59,890
What?

254
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,830
What?

255
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,030
What are you doing?

256
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,130
You!

257
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,370
Let go of me.

258
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,270
Lord Igyeom!

259
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,840
I just said it, hoping to save you.

260
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,120
Sir!

261
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,190
Out of my way!

262
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,650
Or the royal agent dies!

263
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,760
I am fine so apprehend him.

264
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,660
Be quiet!

265
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,200
Lady Dain.

266
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,570
Put the bow down!

267
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,880
Lady Dain, what are you doing?

268
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,550
Didn't you hear his order?

269
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,880
Do not try anything foolish.

270
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,450
No.

271
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,120
Dain, don't shoot.

272
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,550
Lord Seong, Trust me.

273
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,260
Don't shoot!

274
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,530
This is the last one.

275
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,270
If you have a clear idea of what
you want to hit, you can do better.

276
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,100
What you are trying to hit
is not that tree.

277
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,540
Imagine about what you want to hit.

278
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,780
Imagine about what I...

279
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,580
Want to hit.

280
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,050
What is she doing?

281
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,120
No!

282
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,230
No!

283
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,750
Sir!

284
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,290
Lord Seong, are you all right?

285
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,430
Your terrible archery skills saved me.

286
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,690
Never again,

287
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,800
never again shoot an arrow.

288
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,270
I will remember that.

289
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,010
But I saved your life.

290
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,110
Sunae.

291
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,050
Lord Ibeom.

292
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,790
You're okay?

293
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,320
Yes.

294
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,690
Answer me.

295
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,190
Do you admit killing
the women in this town?

296
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,230
I know nothing about them.

297
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,360
You know nothing?

298
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,840
Do you admit to gathering young scholars
and taking opium poppies?

299
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,870
And entertaining yourselves
with prostitutes?

300
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,440
The prostitutes brought the opium poppy,
so I had no knowledge of it.

301
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,250
And what is so wrong with enjoying
a bit of entertainment

302
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,150
with the young scholars who study hard?

303
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,790
Are you saying you did not kill
the women and Kim Daegwang?

304
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,990
I did not.

305
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,170
Is he telling the truth?

306
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,400
Tell me.

307
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,040
It is true.

308
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,440
I watched you sell opium poppy
to a courtesan,

309
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,810
so how dare you lie to me?

310
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,310
Well...

311
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,180
It was Gwiseon who produced
the opium poppy and gave it to you.

312
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,890
Does that mean you killed Gwiseon?

313
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,420
No!

314
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,390
It was not me.

315
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,630
Does that mean it was you?

316
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,790
No! It was not me!

317
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,760
They are lying.

318
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,300
Beat them!

319
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,200
Lord Seong!

320
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,340
We only did what we were told.

321
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,770
It was Magistrate who killed Gwiseon.

322
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,570
That is correct.

323
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,410
You!

324
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,040
Gwiseon threatened to tell you everything,
so he killed her.

325
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,050
Is that true?

326
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,520
- That is true.
- That is true.

327
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,890
Do you still deny it?

328
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,060
You!

329
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,760
You ruined everything.

330
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,000
Kill me.

331
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,440
Killing you is not difficult.

332
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,910
I will report your crimes to His Majesty,
so you can be punished.

333
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,280
Until the royal order arrives, you will be
held at the provincial office prison.

334
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,820
You will not be able
to avoid decapitation,

335
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,490
so beg the Heavens for mercy
until you take your final breath.

336
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,930
Take this man away.

337
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,260
You have become a royal secret agent
who saves people.

338
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,130
I am very proud of you.

339
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,200
I became successful but lost you.

340
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,230
My fault is grave for leaving you behind.

341
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,500
If only I had not gone
to take the state exam,

342
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,810
you would not have suffered such ordeals.

343
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,710
There is no need to feel guilty.

344
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,980
What happened that day was my choice.

345
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,030
Why won't either of you tell me?

346
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,500
Tell me what happened.

347
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,870
I will.

348
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,510
After you left,

349
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,150
I

350
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,350
became Lord Ibeom's woman.

351
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,950
Is that true?

352
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,990
To you, I belong in the past.

353
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,700
You...

354
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,430
Must keep going
and become even more successful.

355
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,000
Put your past behind you

356
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,340
and keep walking toward your dream.

357
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,080
You are unyielding.

358
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,910
Very unyielding.

359
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,620
Do you still refuse to change your mind?

360
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:19,830
Magistrate, I may be a peasant,
but I am betrothed to a man.

361
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,200
How could you demand me to betray him?

362
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,430
A retired courtesan's daughter
talking about chastity?

363
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,840
If you say so, what can I do?

364
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,410
I found this at your house.

365
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,490
You must be a Catholic.

366
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,170
There must be others like you.

367
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,600
If you continue to refuse
to join me in my bed,

368
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,240
I will frame everyone you know
of being a Catholic

369
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,210
and behead them.

370
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,940
No!

371
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,580
I am the only one,
so please leave others alone.

372
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,090
That depends on you.

373
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,090
I will give you one day.

374
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,990
Think about it.

375
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,830
Lock her up!

376
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,430
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

377
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,150
The magistrate wants the prisoner.

378
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,220
Yes, sir.

379
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,740
I must save you.

380
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,940
What do you mean?

381
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,010
If you do as the magistrate says,
you will die,

382
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,310
and if you do not, your friends will die.

383
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Lord Igyeom will come for me.

384
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,620
No one in Joseon can protect
or save a Catholic.

385
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,130
Please leave.

386
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,660
I would rather die.

387
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,370
Do you not care about losing your life?

388
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,840
I will leave it all to Heaven.

389
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,010
Then let us leave it to Heaven.

390
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,390
Get them!

391
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,245
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

392
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,160
Lord Seong, are you all right?

393
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,100
Lady Dain, how could he be?

394
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,800
His beloved had an affair with his brother
and went far away.

395
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,900
And when he saved her life,
she told him to never seek her again.

396
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,170
What is this?

397
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,470
What? What now?

398
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,980
If it were me, Park Chunsam,
I could not let them be.

399
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,280
Lord Ibeom is much better at martial arts,
much more muscular,

400
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,820
much taller, and for appearance?

401
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,620
Well, I guess you win that category.

402
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,890
Still, how could she dump him?

403
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,560
- Stop it.
- Don't you agree, sir?

404
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
What's with your eyes?

405
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,230
- No, Lord Seong.
- Those eyes.

406
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,130
Please calm yourself.

407
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,430
I understand why people commit murder.

408
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,230
What?

409
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,330
I am just concerned about you.

410
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,940
Pardon me.

411
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,880
Lord Seong, try to focus
on the journey ahead.

412
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
We are almost at Jeonju.

413
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,590
We will go to Seongmunsan first.

414
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,320
Why?

415
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,020
You will know soon enough.

416
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,970
Your Majesty, I am beside myself
with shame for causing you concern

417
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,640
with the recent discovery of the greed
and tyranny of the corrupt officials.

418
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,679
It is not your fault
so do not blame yourself.

419
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,850
That means the royal secret agent
is doing his part.

420
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,090
Your Majesty, I am afraid to say

421
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:56,560
that there is something that may cause
more concerns for you.

422
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,230
Concerns?

423
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,630
What is it?

424
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,920
This is an okro.

425
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,731
{\an8}OKRO: AN ORNAMENT
THAT GOES ON TOP OF A GAT

426
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,750
Your Majesty,

427
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,860
that is an okro that was owned
by Prince Hwiyeong who attempted to steal

428
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,719
Your Majesty's throne.

429
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,000
Prince Hwiyeong.

430
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,380
The records said it was Dobongam
in Seongmunsan,

431
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,850
so it must be around here
where Prince Hwiyeong died.

432
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,830
Father!

433
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,370
I will return soon.

434
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,570
Give me a few nights, would you?

435
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,450
Sir, who is Prince Hwiyeong?

436
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,280
He was a traitor.

437
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,920
A traitor?

438
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,460
Then why did he die here instead of being
punished at the palace?

439
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,430
While he was being transported to Hanyang
for the crime of treason,

440
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,230
he took his own life.

441
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,350
Lady Dain, are you all right?

442
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,880
You look pale.

443
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,650
I am fine.

444
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,820
Jeonju is near.

445
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,260
You can do this.

446
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,690
There is one last mission left.

447
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,200
Learning the truth
behind Prince Hwiyeong's death.

448
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,170
We will go ahead. Take your time.

449
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,770
We came together,
so we should go together.

450
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,790
Father.

451
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,170
It is I.

452
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,360
Why are you alone?

453
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,930
I sent Chunsam ahead.

454
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,910
Why did you want to stop here?

455
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,540
I thought you might want to.

456
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,420
I do not understand your intentions.

457
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,990
You know I am connected
with Prince Hwiyeong,

458
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,620
so why won't you ask me anything?

459
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,700
I thought you might need time.

460
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,010
Prince Hwiyeong is known to be a traitor.

461
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,210
It might put you in danger,
so how can you be so composed?

462
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,150
It was your tenacity that made me want
to find out for myself

463
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,320
the truth behind Prince Hwiyeong's death.

464
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,450
Lord Seong.

465
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,860
You are my attendant.

466
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,560
And you will be with me through the end.

467
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,640
So trust me.

468
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,050
Your Majesty, I am here.

469
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,490
I summoned you despite the time

470
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,690
because I have an important question for you.

471
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,370
Take a close look.

472
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,350
When my father was alive,
he had that specially made for someone.

473
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,590
Do you know the owner of that okro?

474
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,120
I am embarrassed to say I do not know.

475
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,730
That is the traitor
Prince Hwiyeong's jade heron.

476
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:15,170
That traitor's belonging was found
in your home.

477
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,780
I do not know anything about this.

478
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,980
Maybe you do not know.

479
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,380
But that girl must know.

480
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,020
What girl?

481
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,650
The girl named Hong Dain,
who is staying at your house.

482
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,390
I heard that was found in her room.

483
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,560
Why does that girl have something
that belonged to a traitor?

484
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,100
If you do not know, summon that girl.

485
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,510
Right now!

486
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:56,250
Your Majesty,
he cannot summon her right now.

487
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,310
What do you mean?

488
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,780
She is with the royal agent.

489
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:11,830
Your Majesty, that girl must have a motive
for accompanying the royal agent.

490
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,700
The traitor's followers
must be conspiring.

491
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,570
What traitor?

492
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,810
Do not speak in haste.

493
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,180
Your Majesty, allow them time.

494
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,980
Everything will be cleared once
the royal agent returns from his mission.

495
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,750
Your Majesty!

496
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,690
Traitors might be plotting something
this very moment!

497
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,830
Please summon the royal agent!

498
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,330
Summon that girl
and the royal secret agent.

499
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,630
Stop!

500
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,500
Go and check him.

501
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,300
Yes, sir.

502
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,440
Hello!

503
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,100
Hello!

504
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,350
If you want to stay alive,
drop your weapons!

505
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,180
You!

506
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,190
Who dares to threaten the government army?

507
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:44,590
Guards! Get him!

508
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,490
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

509
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,950
Lord Seong, over there.

510
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,960
Sir! Sir!

511
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,760
Over there, over there.

512
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,770
Don't go. Sir, don't go, don't!

513
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,710
Oh, geez.

514
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,820
Take cover.

515
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,410
Don't do it, don't do it.

516
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,540
Don't do it, don't shoot.

517
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,460
Brother!

518
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,500
- Brother!
- Brother!

519
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,780
It's an ambush!

520
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,320
Retreat.

521
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,130
Are you all right?

522
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,900
Thank you for helping us.

523
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,740
We could have lost everything.

524
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,270
Where are you going with that much rice?

525
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,310
We are headed for Hyemisa.

526
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,710
Hyemisa.

527
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,080
To a Buddhist temple?

528
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,780
Many are injured.
We must return to the provincial office.

529
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,490
Pardon me for asking when we've just met,

530
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,090
but would you be willing to help us
return to the provincial office?

531
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,390
We will.

532
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:35,360
Thank you.

533
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,420
Thank you very much.
I will never forget this.

534
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,450
I will report this to the governor
and give you a reward,

535
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,990
so please return tomorrow.

536
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,330
Government army taking rice to a temple.

537
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,870
What do you think that is about?

538
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,140
It was the governor who sent them,
so there must be a reason.

539
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:34,380
Geumgangsan has beautiful peaks
and the mountain ranges

540
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,090
th-that stand tall among clouds

541
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,120
and the peak that appears
to be covered in snow

542
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,390
stand tall toward the sky,

543
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:49,230
so people have c-called it a scenic spot.

544
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,170
My Lord, the head of propriety is here.

545
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,140
He may enter.

546
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:12,260
My Lord, I am ashamed to say,

547
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,160
the rice offered to Buddha
that was headed for Hyemisa

548
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,660
has returned to the government office.

549
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,230
What?

550
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,800
Well, they were attacked by bandits
on their way.

551
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,010
Did you capture the bandits?

552
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,170
I am sorry.

553
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,820
Apprehend those men!

554
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,120
I will show them what happens
when they come after

555
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,820
the rice offered to Buddha.

556
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,850
Yes, My Lord.

557
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,970
What are you staring at?

558
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:00,770
I-I have committed a grave sin!

559
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:05,110
I have an imbecile for a book reader.

560
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,320
What are you so afraid of?

561
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,760
Wow, is this the famous Jeonju bibimbap?

562
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,300
How much is it?

563
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,730
Six coins.

564
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,870
Six coins?

565
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,570
Are you ripping us off
because we are from out of town?

566
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:35,940
Ripping you off?

567
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,570
If you don't like it, go somewhere else.

568
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,180
You think we won't?

569
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,410
Talk about being unkind.

570
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:41,580
Sir, let us go.

571
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,950
Chunsam.

572
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:45,850
Hostess, why is the meal price so high?

573
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,780
Because it is for food.

574
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,920
Do you know how rare rice is these days?

575
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,220
I understand so calm yourself.

576
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,290
Sir.

577
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,090
Thank you.

578
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,630
Sit down.
As long as it is delicious.

579
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,440
This is some expensive rice.

580
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,740
Lady Dain, count every grain of rice
and chew thoroughly.

581
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,210
The price of rice must have gone up
because of bad harvest.

582
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,220
That must be why those bandits
went after the rice.

583
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:23,650
Is it good?

584
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,660
Lord Seong, what are your plans?

585
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,700
I will visit the government office
tomorrow afternoon.

586
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,030
I may be able to meet the governor
because I helped his soldiers today.

587
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,610
If you want to meet the governor,
you can appear as the royal agent.

588
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:47,310
If the answer was that easy to find,
they would not have sent a royal agent.

589
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,010
I must approach it in a meticulous manner.

590
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,180
Then how...

591
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,050
Dain,

592
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,090
let me eat.

593
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,310
What is taking him so long?

594
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,220
Lord Seong, let us hurry.

595
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,750
Dain, you stay here.

596
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,490
What? What do you mean?

597
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,630
Even if I do meet the governor,
I will go in alone.

598
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,370
Lord Seong, I am sure
I can be of assistance.

599
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,030
You must have forgotten,

600
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,270
but this is a mission I received
as a royal secret agent.

601
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,500
You need to follow my orders.

602
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,550
This is the royal agent's mission,
but it is also mine.

603
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,950
That is precisely the reason.

604
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,090
I cannot work with someone who is ruled
by personal feelings.

605
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,960
So if you wish to help me, stay here.

606
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,780
Come.

607
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,340
What about Lady Dain?

608
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,950
I told her to stay here.

609
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,250
What?

610
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,280
Did something happen between you two?

611
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,020
Nothing happened.

612
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,150
But we always go together.

613
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,720
You want Lady Dain to stay here?

614
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,060
I am doing this for her.

615
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,230
What? Why?

616
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,290
Come.

617
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,830
Yes, sir.

618
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,310
What brings you here?

619
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,010
I am here to meet the captain.

620
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,160
Welcome.

621
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,690
This is the head of propriety
of this government office.

622
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,300
He is the man who saved us.

623
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,400
If it hadn't been for him,
we would have been in serious trouble.

624
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,940
You have delicate features,
but you must be strong.

625
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:34,240
I hear that often.

626
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,150
I am known to surprise people.

627
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,300
Well, he does appear to be better

628
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,490
than your men who let
the bandits beat them.

629
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,220
I will leave this up to you.

630
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,190
Yes, sir.

631
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:52,500
Oh, and since you experienced trouble,
I will repay you for that.

632
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,310
Do not brag about it and make it last.

633
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,710
What is this?

634
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,180
It is the Jeolla Province rice,
which is more valuable than gold.

635
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:14,020
Remember you promised
to mention me to the governor?

636
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,790
I would like to meet him.

637
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,450
Really?

638
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,790
Do you think the governor
has a lot of time on his hands?

639
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,060
How dare you mention him?

640
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,830
Wait here.

641
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,170
Sir, what is his deal?

642
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,570
When the tiger is gone,
the fox plays king.

643
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,180
I am sorry.

644
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,190
Actually, I have an offer for you.

645
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,890
How about working with us?

646
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:56,830
What? Work with you?

647
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,660
I noticed yesterday
that you are an excellent archer.

648
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,030
We desperately need archers like you.

649
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,240
I will consider it.

650
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,010
Are you really considering joining
the provincial army?

651
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,950
It is a chance to observe the governor.

652
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,350
Oh, now we have to join the army?

653
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,050
My heart! What was that?

654
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:25,690
Hey! Little boy!

655
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,220
You stop right there!

656
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,690
You! Darn it!

657
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,160
Hey!

658
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,560
There is never a peaceful day!

659
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:34,760
Hey!

660
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,390
How odd. I'm sure he came this way.

661
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,460
Sir, where could he have gone?

662
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:06,300
The road is...

663
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,230
Sir!

664
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,010
Sir, what is this?

665
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,730
I am not going there again.

666
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,100
I will not!

667
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,730
Why would you say that so suddenly?

668
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,800
Please reconsider.

669
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,710
Where else could you find a job

670
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:52,840
that pays as well as reading books
for the governor?

671
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,940
I should have listened to my friends.

672
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:57,410
Why did I say yes to that job?

673
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:58,820
Calm down.

674
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,620
If you quit too,

675
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,520
how am I supposed to do business?

676
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,090
How would I know?

677
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,890
Anyway, I cannot do it anymore.

678
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:07,690
Wait!

679
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,230
Hey, Gannan!

680
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,590
Gannan, Miss Gannan!

681
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,700
Hey, leave the books!

682
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,060
Oh, darn it.

683
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,330
Pardon me.

684
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,100
Are you looking for book readers?

685
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,910
Yes, I sure am.

686
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:27,640
Come in and have a seat.

687
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,150
I told you not to steal!

688
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,220
Give that to me!

689
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,080
Give it!

690
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,420
I am sorry.

691
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,550
I should have taught my son better.

692
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,610
You look like you need this.

693
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:58,680
Take it.

694
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,440
What?

695
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,720
I don't know how to repay you.

696
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,050
Pardon me for asking,
but where is your husband?

697
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,730
Is there a reason?

698
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,000
We weren't living like this in the past.

699
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,000
When my husband was alive,

700
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,340
we owned a small piece of land
and a house.

701
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,140
But we could not pay back
the high interest loan,

702
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,080
so the government office took our land
and house,

703
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,150
and the stress killed my husband.

704
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,220
The government office lent money
on high interest?

705
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:43,850
Yes, they did.

706
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,160
The governor provides high-interest loans
through grain exchange

707
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,020
and charges interest
that is two times higher.

708
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,390
I could not get rice.

709
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,130
Take him away.

710
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,030
- Please forgive me.
- Come.

711
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:59,000
Bad harvest was not the only reason
why rice is as expensive as gold.

712
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,540
I heard the governor is suffering
from a dreadful skin disease

713
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,940
and has been offering rice to Buddha
to cure his illness.

714
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,950
And that rice is the rice he took from us.

715
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,680
Sir, the rice from yesterday

716
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,890
must be the rice the governor
was offering to Buddha.

717
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,560
You're back. Come in.

718
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:38,240
You're back.

719
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,540
Lady Dain,

720
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,310
we learned something very important.

721
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:42,950
What is it?

722
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,480
The reason why that bibimbap
was six coins.

723
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,320
What?

724
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,220
The governor has been taking rice
from people and offering it to the temple.

725
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,220
How can a governor steal food
from his people?

726
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,160
So, did you meet the governor?

727
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,460
He is suffering from a skin disease,
so he never leaves the government office.

728
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,300
Skin disease?

729
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:08,100
That must be why he said
I should never look at his face.

730
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,110
We are going back to the government office
tomorrow and meet the captain once more.

731
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,310
What were you doing by yourself?

732
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,920
A book.

733
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,720
I was reading a book.

734
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,650
You were reading a book?

735
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,460
Yes.

736
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:29,330
What?

737
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,590
Do I need your permission to read a book?

738
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:32,860
I can read if I want.

739
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,100
Let me go and read this book.

740
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,280
Sir, about Lady Dain,

741
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,610
I am worried about her.

742
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,780
I doubt she will stay at the tavern.

743
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:06,460
What do you need?

744
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,230
I am the new book reader.

745
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,980
My Lord, the book reader is here.

746
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:26,850
Let her in!

747
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:45,230
I am here to serve you.

748
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,200
I am Hong Dain.

749
01:01:22,627 --> 01:01:25,603
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

750
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,430
<i>Tell me the truth, My Lord.</i>

751
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:28,860
<i>Who sent you?</i>

752
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,530
<i>I am sure someone sent you with a motive.</i>

753
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:32,400
<i>What?</i>

754
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,500
<i>What is Lady Dain doing over there?</i>

755
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,440
<i>Chunsam, go and bring the station guards
as soon as possible.</i>

756
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,640
<i>Are you going to announce yourself?</i>

757
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,610
<i>I will make the governor tell me the truth
about what happened to Prince Hwiyeong.</i>

758
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:40,940
<i>They are going to behead Dain.</i>

759
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,140
<i>What? Behead her?</i>

760
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,740
<i>I must go to the government office now.</i>
