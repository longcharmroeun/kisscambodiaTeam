1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,161
Is anyone home?

2
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:08,535
EPISODE 15

3
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:10,925
Anyone home?

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,070
Ibeom.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,340
Is anyone home?

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,680
What is it?

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,880
He needs urgent care.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,610
Come in.

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,650
Hurry.

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you planning on facing them?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,900
Yes.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,030
You are foolish. This will slightly hurt.

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,570
What do you...

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,470
That way!

15
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,710
What are you waiting for?
The rest of them went that way.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,450
Stop standing around and go!

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,750
Do you want them to get away?

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,820
After them!

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,820
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,190
Hand him over to us.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,459
We will take him.

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,459
Ibeom, now.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,780
That hurt very much, not slightly.

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,320
Let us move them.

25
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,530
Doctor, please save him.

26
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,529
How is he?

27
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,320
I am dying without realizing my goal,

28
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,320
and it enrages me.

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,590
Gyesu.

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,540
I was my own master.

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,950
So you must, too,
become your own master.

32
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,720
I will.

33
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,790
And...

34
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,660
For those without power...

35
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,050
- Boss!
- Boss!

36
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,970
Ibeom.

37
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,710
I should have killed Byeon Haksu.

38
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,180
He asked Hanyang to send soldiers.

39
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,250
Had you killed him,

40
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,250
instead of being a criminal,
he would have become a righteous man,

41
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,120
and Jeonju would've become
completely ruined.

42
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,520
A righteous man?

43
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,260
A world where a man
who imprisons the innocent

44
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,830
and uses their lives to apprehend robbers
is named righteous

45
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,030
is a world that is in disorder, is it not?

46
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,700
Was it truly to right the wrong?

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,310
Then the first step should've been
to reveal Byeon Haksu's crimes.

48
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,670
Judgment comes after that!

49
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,710
I am not interested in judgment!

50
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,650
A truly righteous man just lost his life.

51
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,690
And soon enough, those who are in prison

52
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,260
will lose their lives at the hands
of Byeon Haksu.

53
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,130
I will not let that be.

54
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,240
You saved Byeon Haksu's life,
so you must keep your word.

55
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,370
If people lose their lives,

56
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,609
you will pay for it with your own.

57
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,120
Are you saying you will kill me?

58
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,450
You are a royal secret agent, so
let's try to prevent that from happening.

59
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,260
Before I am a royal secret agent,
I am your older brother.

60
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,640
Pay for it with my life?

61
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,270
How can my own brother say that?

62
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,690
Chunsam, what if something happened
to Lord Seong?

63
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,430
Right? Chunsam...

64
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,359
How dare you!

65
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,200
Hey!

66
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,600
Oh no!

67
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Chunsam! Park Chunsam!

68
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,100
What? Why am I lying on my back?

69
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,670
What?

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,470
What happened?

71
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,170
How dare you.

72
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,540
Lord Seong may be in deep trouble,
so how could you fall asleep? How?

73
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,580
Sleep?
I was deep in thought! I was!

74
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,150
Geez, you should wipe the drool
off your chin first.

75
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,160
Lord Seong.

76
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,060
Are you hurt?

77
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,590
I am fine.

78
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,530
Sir, what took you so long?

79
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,330
I couldn't sleep
because I was worried about you.

80
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,100
How did everything go?

81
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,480
Why don't we go inside first?

82
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,380
Yes.

83
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,550
What kind of a governor
would kill innocent people

84
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,490
just to apprehend the robbers?

85
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,550
It must be an empty threat.

86
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,090
Perhaps it was at first,
but the situation has changed.

87
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,400
He almost lost his life to the robbers
he wished to apprehend,

88
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,730
so he might try to get revenge.

89
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,270
That's true. He must be furious.

90
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,440
Even he won't be able
to execute all those people.

91
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,470
If he does or already did,

92
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,380
people near the provincial office
must have heard something.

93
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,010
We will go and find out what is going on
at the provincial office.

94
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,910
Yes, sir.

95
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,330
How could you take all those men
and fail to apprehend even one robber?

96
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,600
Please forgive me.

97
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,740
Lord Byeon, give us more time.

98
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,810
Jeonju is in the palm of my hand,
so if anything...

99
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:09,680
Seong Ibeom held his sword against my neck

100
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,120
just around the corner
from my provincial office!

101
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,600
I will give you three days.

102
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,870
If you fail to apprehend them
within that time,

103
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,810
I will have your heads.

104
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,710
- Yes, Lord Byeon.
- Yes, Lord Byeon.

105
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,950
Pardon me, Court Lady Kim.

106
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,920
Yes!

107
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Lord Jang.

108
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,430
Did I startle you?

109
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,430
No, Lord Jang.

110
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,040
How is Dain, I mean, Yeongsin doing?

111
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,410
What?

112
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,040
Oh, Lady Yeongsin?

113
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,080
She is wonderful.

114
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,820
She has become a true lady
from a prominent family.

115
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,490
I was planning on paying her
a visit tonight.

116
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,260
What?

117
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,490
Tonight?

118
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,330
What is it?

119
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,730
Is everything okay?

120
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,270
Well, actually...

121
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
Lady Yeongsin has...

122
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,140
She has developed
a large boil on her behind.

123
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
A boil?

124
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,980
Oh, geez. Has a doctor seen her?

125
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,020
I must see her this instant.

126
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,350
No!

127
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,990
No?

128
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,300
Because of the location of the boil,
she has ordered to decline all visitors.

129
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,170
I have raised her since she was a child,
so there is no need to be ashamed.

130
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,140
Lord Jang!

131
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,940
Actually, Lady Yeongsin...

132
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,980
Has fallen ill with a disease.

133
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,080
A disease?

134
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,790
Yes, her entire body
is covered with rashes,

135
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,820
and the doctor forbade any visitors.

136
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,360
Dain is ill with a disease,

137
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,530
and you expect me to turn a blind eye?

138
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,000
I must go and see her this instant.

139
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,170
Lord Jang!

140
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,540
Tell me the truth.

141
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,580
Did Yeongsin get into trouble again?

142
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,750
Actually...

143
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,020
She is gone? What do you mean?

144
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,960
It is all my fault.

145
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,990
I should have looked into her.

146
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,930
Her wedding is approaching,
so where did she go?

147
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,270
I feel dreadful to say this,
but she rejected the marriage proposal.

148
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,240
She rejected it? For what reason?

149
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,550
Her heart
belongs to someone else.

150
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,750
She left because of him?

151
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,290
She did.

152
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,830
I knew she was strong-willed,
but this was unexpected.

153
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,270
So who is the man that has her heart?

154
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,680
I am not certain, but knowing her nature,
it cannot be just anyone.

155
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,310
He must be a trustworthy man,
so do not be concerned.

156
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,480
What kind of a trustworthy man
lets a woman leave her home?

157
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,160
I must see who he is with my own eyes.

158
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,090
Send someone to find Yeongsin.

159
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,500
Assistant Royal Guard Choi.

160
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,180
How do you feel?

161
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,780
Thanks to you, I have recovered fully.

162
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,480
I am as strong as an ox.

163
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
I will not go down that easily.

164
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,220
I am glad to hear.

165
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,760
Assistant, I mean, Section Chief Seong,
how is he?

166
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,800
This is only for you.

167
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,370
He has gone on a secret mission.

168
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,270
Again?

169
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,040
Yes, but the problem is...

170
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,040
That Yeongsin has gone with him again.

171
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,950
So I was thinking...

172
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,050
What is the matter?

173
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,960
Actually, I may look perfectly well
on the outside,

174
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,490
but the inside is a different story.

175
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,360
Are you all right?

176
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,600
I will be, in time.
Please excuse me.

177
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,470
It is a royal command.

178
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,620
It is a special mission
His Majesty has given you.

179
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,750
A special mission?

180
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,300
Please look after Yeongsin.

181
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:00,700
Yes, Lord Jang.

182
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,810
Your Majesty.

183
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,570
Rest in peace.

184
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,450
He must die in order to save many lives.

185
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,690
We are standing at the edge of a cliff.

186
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,420
We must choose between jumping off
or turning around and fight.

187
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,420
Which will you choose?

188
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,300
Send letters
to inform of Jeon Gyesu's passing.

189
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,350
Her fever is very high.

190
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,650
When did this start?

191
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,250
It started last night.

192
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,820
Had we been in the village,
I could have taken her to a doctor.

193
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,930
Where are her parents?

194
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,900
Her mom was taken
by the provincial office guards,

195
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,330
and her father was...

196
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,410
I will take her to a doctor.

197
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,640
You cannot go alone.

198
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,550
Can you help her?

199
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,590
Be careful.

200
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,490
I will.

201
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,930
Come to think of it, you said one of them
was struck with a sword, did you not?

202
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,930
I did.

203
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,510
You go to the pottery village
and look for their trace.

204
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,210
I will check another place.

205
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:21,940
Yes, Lord Bae.

206
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,890
This is from prolonged exposure to cold,
so do not be concerned.

207
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Thank you.

208
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,630
I do not know how to repay you.

209
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,630
It is nothing.

210
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,160
In hard times like this,
we must help each other.

211
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:49,670
I do not wish to see another life lost.

212
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,769
Did something happen last night?

213
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,480
Well...

214
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,180
Do you remember the men who gave
rice to people in the back alley?

215
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,050
The men who robbed the rice offering
from the governor?

216
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,990
The leader of those men died.

217
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,960
Is that true?

218
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,560
Well...

219
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,060
Come out!

220
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,980
Did you hear about the attack
on the governor last night?

221
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,120
Be it misfortune or fortune,
Lord Byeon was not hurt,

222
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,530
but one of the robbers was.

223
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,830
So I was wondering...

224
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,370
If anyone who was struck with a sword
came to see you.

225
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,610
There was no one.

226
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Is that so?

227
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,510
But there's something odd.

228
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,690
This place is reeking of blood.

229
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,590
Stay here. I will go out.

230
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,460
We can pretend like we are patients.

231
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,700
If they recognize me,
everyone will be in danger.

232
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,570
If they ask you about me,
tell them you do not know me.

233
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,780
In that case, can we look around?

234
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,530
Thank you for treating me, Doctor.

235
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,440
Wait!

236
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,220
Have we met before?

237
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,890
Pardon me?

238
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,360
No, we have not.

239
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,830
Is that so?

240
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,840
You may go.

241
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,370
Yes, sir.

242
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,180
Lord Ibeom!

243
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,050
She is...

244
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,090
Apprehend them all!

245
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,130
You!

246
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,040
I finally found you.

247
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,110
May I ask you something?

248
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,050
Has there been an execution announcement?

249
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,010
Execution?

250
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,320
Well, I have not heard of any.

251
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,850
Hey.

252
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,390
Sir, isn't that Bae?

253
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,800
How can a treacherous man like him
still work at the provincial office?

254
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,730
Lord Seong.

255
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,720
Lady Sunae.

256
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,160
Lord Byeon!

257
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Did you apprehend them?

258
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,270
Yes, I apprehended a girl.

259
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:20,440
What? You took all the guards
and apprehended a girl?

260
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
The girl is...

261
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,120
I ordered you to apprehend Seong Ibeom,
not to apprehend a measly girl!

262
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,520
I will torture her
and find out where Seong Ibeom is.

263
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,630
If torturing a girl could do the job,
we could have already done it.

264
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,230
We have many of them in prison.

265
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,600
It will only lower the price,
so do not try anything useless

266
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,770
and hand all of them over to the merchant.

267
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,600
Yes, Lord Byeon.

268
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,780
Seong Ibeom.

269
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,620
You must know.

270
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,230
What are you talking about?

271
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,860
Tell me,
where are the robbers?

272
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,870
Who are you calling robbers?

273
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,640
Is it because you are in league
with the robbers?

274
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,580
You are brazen.

275
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,750
You left the village in ruins,
so who could have stayed?

276
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,990
Everyone has left.

277
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,190
Lord Bae.

278
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,930
We have searched the whole village,
but no one was there.

279
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,000
Take her and lock her up!

280
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,770
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

281
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,610
Merchant Jang and his men will arrive
through the back gate later,

282
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,820
so sell everyone, including her.

283
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Yes, Lord Bae.

284
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,150
Follow me.

285
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,040
Come.

286
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,880
Yes, sir.

287
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,250
Hey!

288
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,590
I am coming, sir!

289
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,630
What took you so long?

290
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,670
Out of my way!

291
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,210
What is this?

292
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,310
Show me to your room.

293
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,610
What?

294
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,550
What brings you here, sir?

295
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,120
That is what I wish to ask.

296
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,060
How can a corrupt man like you
still be working at the provincial office?

297
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,030
You are too harsh.

298
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,810
The painting on the wall
is Gyeomjae's Geumgangsan.

299
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,040
Lord Seong, look at this.

300
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,250
What is that, Lady Yeongsin?

301
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,050
This is a painting of Geumgangsan
by Gyeomjae.

302
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,780
It was hanging in the office
of the former governor.

303
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,090
What is the former governor's painting
doing here?

304
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,490
I'm curious too.

305
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,890
Why is such a valuable painting
hanging here?

306
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,290
Could it be...

307
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,800
How dare you!

308
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,730
Are you implying I stole it?

309
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,170
I have not said anything.

310
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,010
The guilty always flinches.

311
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,440
The governor is busy
trying to apprehend the robbers,

312
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,580
but the true robber was right next to him.

313
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,110
Lord Seong, I am innocent!

314
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,620
I was only keeping it safe
for the time being.

315
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,950
Please believe me.

316
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:29,320
Sir, why listen
to a treacherous man like him?

317
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,760
Let us bury him.

318
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,630
- What?
- He will dig his own grave.

319
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,290
Should we?

320
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,730
Oh, Lord Seong, please spare me!

321
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,210
Do you want to live?

322
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,780
Answer my questions.

323
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,320
I heard that the people associated
with the robbers have been imprisoned.

324
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,220
Is the governor truly planning
to execute them?

325
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,160
Well...

326
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,290
Chunsam, fetch the shovel.

327
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,000
- Yes, sir.
- Don't!

328
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,730
They were sent to the slave market.

329
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,570
Slave market?

330
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,440
There is a market
where they trade slaves not far from here.

331
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,970
Does that mean
he turned them into slaves and sold them?

332
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,910
Yes.

333
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,180
Lord Seong, that must be why
they only took women.

334
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Women are more valuable.

335
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,780
Is that true?

336
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,150
Yes.

337
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,860
Did you also sell the woman
you apprehended this afternoon?

338
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,300
That pretty girl?

339
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,630
I also sold her.

340
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,970
Where is the market?

341
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,540
I do not know.
I have told you everything I know.

342
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,970
You!

343
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,440
Sir, do you remember the house we spent
one night before arriving in Jeonju?

344
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,680
That widow said she wished
to sell us to the slave market.

345
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,010
What?

346
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,050
Get inside!

347
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,980
Get in.

348
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,670
Is anyone home?

349
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,340
Who is it?

350
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,850
I am a traveler.
May I spend the night here?

351
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,550
I have a guest who arrived earlier.

352
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,250
Do you mind sharing the room with him?

353
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,490
I do not.

354
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,230
It is this room.

355
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:36,436
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN

356
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,170
May I join you?

357
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,780
He is sound asleep, clueless of his fate.

358
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:03,014
Wake up. Wake up.

359
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:04,741
Wake up.

360
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,730
Wake up!

361
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,170
Assistant Royal Guard Choi?

362
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,940
What?

363
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,140
This is a dream. A dream.

364
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,920
This is not a dream, so wake up.

365
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,760
Yes, it is I.

366
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,910
I have not had guests in a long while.

367
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,650
You may break a few bones,
but we must take them and sell them.

368
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,950
Do you understand?

369
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,230
Sir, when should we attack?

370
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,130
Now.

371
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,130
Now?

372
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,730
Stop right there!

373
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,910
Assistant Royal Guard Choi?

374
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,720
We meet again.

375
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,350
Have you fully recovered?

376
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,850
As you can see.

377
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,320
What brings you here?

378
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,530
Are you traveling?

379
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,800
What? How could I be?

380
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,700
You do not look busy,

381
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,910
so would you assist me
with apprehending these people?

382
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,640
What? Who are you?

383
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,010
Chunsam.

384
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,020
He is a royal secret agent.

385
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,790
Oh, goodness!

386
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,270
This is the slave market pass
the widow told us about.

387
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,400
Is it not illegal to buy and sell slaves
at the slave market?

388
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,840
It is an illegal market that is open
without the government's permission.

389
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,710
Why do you think they are selling
and buying people there?

390
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,540
Because it brings in money.

391
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,610
And even if they die of being abused,
no one will raise any issue.

392
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,580
What?

393
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,180
Even if slaves are considered
no better than animals,

394
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,090
their lives are not worthless!

395
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,190
Sir, you must announce
your appearance tomorrow.

396
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,760
I must find out about the slave market
in order to appear as a royal agent.

397
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,560
And we must rescue those
who are held there as captives.

398
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,630
Yes.

399
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,770
Well, I am sorry to interrupt,

400
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,470
but you must return to Hanyang
with me tomorrow.

401
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,440
What? Royal Assistant Guard Choi,

402
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,740
how could you ask me to return to Hanyang
after what you just heard?

403
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,110
But I...

404
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,520
His Majesty ordered...

405
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,750
If you turn a blind eye to the illegal act
that is taking place in front of you,

406
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,490
we would be no better
than those wicked men outside!

407
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,960
Oh...

408
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,090
I am disappointed in you.

409
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,270
You should have refrained.

410
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,200
I am very disappointed.

411
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,740
Lady Yeongsin!

412
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,000
Lady Yeongsin!

413
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,180
But I told you
it was His Majesty's order.

414
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,980
I really did not wish to come.

415
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,320
Assistant Royal Guard Choi,
since you are here, why not join us?

416
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,930
I will persuade Lady Yeongsin to return
with you after it is done.

417
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,100
Do you have a plan to save them
from the slave market?

418
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,370
I am planning on buying them all.

419
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,720
Sir, this place is no joke.
It feels dangerous.

420
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,520
Listen carefully.

421
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,230
As we discussed last night, I will meet
the man in charge of the slave market.

422
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,830
I will show interest
and check the situation inside.

423
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,770
I will make an offer and buy time
by telling them I will bring the money,

424
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,470
and I will return and announce myself
as the royal agent.

425
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,290
You may enter.

426
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,400
Lord Seong, over there.

427
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,220
Is there a product you are looking for?

428
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,060
I wish to buy a healthy slave.

429
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,730
Do you want a male slave or a female one?

430
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,430
If they are good, I wish to buy them all.

431
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,370
Everything we have is of fine quality.

432
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,740
Thing? How dare he.

433
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,140
Then I will buy them all.

434
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,940
Pardon me? I do not understand.

435
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,010
I mean I wish to buy every slave here.

436
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,550
Can you afford to do that?

437
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,610
How dare you!

438
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,520
Money is of no issue with my master.

439
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,290
How much will it be?

440
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,130
I don't think that's
something I can discuss with you.

441
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,730
I will let the merchant know,
so please wait here.

442
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,300
I will.

443
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,400
Thank you.

444
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,550
Jeon Gyesu who strove to save
the common people has lost his life.

445
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,320
I plan to punish the greedy
and tyrannical governor,

446
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,560
so those who wish to join my cause

447
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,660
shall gather at the Jeonju market
on the last day of this month.

448
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,330
Ibeom!

449
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,540
How are things at the hideout?

450
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,710
Sunae was taken
by the provincial guards yesterday.

451
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,610
What?

452
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,910
We must get the weapons. Hurry!

453
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,080
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

454
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,460
Did Gyesu prepare all this?

455
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,830
Yes. He said we would need them someday.

456
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,150
Well, Lord Byeon.

457
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,950
What is it?

458
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:24,460
This is no time to do that.

459
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,200
How dare you tell me
what I should and should not be doing?

460
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,870
Oh.

461
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,340
My life depends on this,
so I cannot tell him.

462
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,180
It is nothing.

463
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,040
Stop.

464
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,180
What did you say?

465
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,980
Your life depends on it?

466
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:59,360
Your life depends on me now,
so speak.

467
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,460
What is it?

468
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,300
The royal secret agent.

469
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,570
What?

470
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,570
What did you say?

471
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,870
The royal secret agent is here.

472
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,970
Where is the royal secret agent?

473
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,310
He must have gone to the slave market.

474
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,910
Slave market?

475
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,580
How did he know about that?

476
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,750
Seong Igyeom?

477
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,320
Seong Igyeom is here?

478
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,790
Do you know him?

479
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:31,990
Of course.

480
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,900
Did you also know that Seong Ibeom,
the leader of the gang of robbers,

481
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,430
is his half-brother?

482
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,100
Is that true?

483
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,770
Yes, they lived in the area
where I was the magistrate.

484
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,340
A royal secret agent and the leader
of the gang are brothers.

485
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,420
This is far more interesting
than I had thought.

486
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,490
Where is he?

487
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,550
He went to the slave market.

488
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,890
I know the owner.

489
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,660
I have a great plan.

490
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,360
What is it?

491
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,000
Go and apprehend the royal agent.

492
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,140
He colluded with the gang of robbers
and involved himself in a rebellion.

493
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,970
His crime deserves being stripped
of his position.

494
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,310
I can finally get my revenge.

495
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,890
Are you hurt?

496
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,460
I am fine.

497
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,030
But how is Lord Ibeom?

498
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,300
He is well, so do not be concerned.

499
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,730
I am glad.

500
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,540
Commoners being traded as slaves.

501
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,470
How is this possible?

502
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,410
They forced them to write
their own sales document.

503
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,510
Their own?

504
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,120
They were forced to sell themselves?

505
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,950
Yes.

506
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,260
Do you know what happens
to those locked up here?

507
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,720
Well...

508
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,730
I heard some people come here
to buy someone,

509
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,730
so they can get human gall bladder
to use as medicine.

510
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,670
The slaves are not registered
with the government,

511
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,970
so even if they are killed,
their status cannot be verified.

512
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,570
How can that be?

513
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,040
Be they slaves or commoners,

514
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,150
no one has the right to do that
to people.

515
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,090
Those beasts...

516
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,930
I am truly sorry
about ending up here.

517
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,900
Do not say that.

518
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,130
There is no need to apologize.

519
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,730
You are the one who deserves an apology.

520
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,670
What happened?

521
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,910
Come with me.

522
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,880
The merchant wishes to meet you.

523
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,940
Pardon me.

524
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,480
Sir.

525
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,480
I will return shortly.

526
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,320
Yes, Lord Igyeom.

527
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,080
He is waiting.

528
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,580
Please go inside.

529
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,150
The merchant enjoys peace and quiet.

530
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,260
There is another room,
so you may wait there.

531
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,090
Please go inside.

532
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,560
It is this way.

533
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,200
This way.

534
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,300
Wait.

535
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,610
A servant cannot go there.

536
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,880
Wait outside.

537
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,080
- But I...
- Hey!

538
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,780
Yes, sir.

539
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,680
Come, come.

540
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,610
Darn it.

541
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,850
I am no ordinary servant.

542
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,790
You are the youngest son of Vice Minister
Seong, the richest man in Gongju?

543
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,730
Yes. You may call me
Literary Licentiate Seong.

544
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:35,700
Why do you need so many slaves,
Literary Licentiate Seong?

545
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,040
There is no better asset
to a nobleman than slaves.

546
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:46,680
Gold is splendid to behold,
but you must hide it away in your home.

547
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,390
But with slaves,
on top of making you money,

548
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,450
they have children
and make you even richer,

549
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,890
so they are wonderful, are they not?

550
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,030
They are.

551
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,360
The noblemen appear to be holding
Joseon together,

552
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,730
but it is actually the slaves.

553
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,230
The noblemen can only grind ink.

554
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,840
They cannot even plow.

555
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,110
You are correct.

556
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,380
So, how much do you want
for all your slaves?

557
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,250
Let me make you a proposal.

558
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,850
Along with the slaves, I will hand you
the deed to the slave market

559
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,580
for ten thousand coins.

560
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,950
Ten thousand coins?

561
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,090
I can buy your slaves,

562
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,720
but I do not need the slave market.

563
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:36,260
I may not appear so, but I am a timid man,
so if I am caught...

564
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,430
Do not be concerned.

565
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,770
I have been bribing the sheriff
and the governors of this region,

566
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,370
so that will not happen.

567
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,370
Even the governor?

568
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,810
That is correct.

569
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:54,080
He was recently appointed here,
but he has a talent for making money.

570
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,880
He has been supplying me with slaves,

571
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,090
so you will not have trouble
making profit.

572
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,740
Open the gate!

573
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,950
Open the gate!

574
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,110
Lord Byeon, what brings you here?

575
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,140
- I have urgent business.
- What is he doing here?

576
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,610
He is with a guest.

577
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,580
It is important. Go and tell him!

578
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,780
Yes, my lord.

579
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,060
These are the self-wrote slave documents.

580
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,570
They all say they are poor and are selling
themselves for their parents and children.

581
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,880
Yes, when you cannot make a living,
you must sell yourself.

582
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,910
Sir!

583
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,420
What is it?

584
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,950
I must tell you something.

585
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:39,920
Come in.

586
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,960
Is that so? I see.

587
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:53,070
Please excuse me for a short while.

588
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,130
Of course.

589
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,650
What is taking him so long?

590
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,920
Come out. The governor is here.

591
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,620
Does that mean he is onto us?

592
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,460
We must let Lord Seong know.

593
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,830
Let us leave for now.

594
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:19,630
Yes.

595
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,770
Lord Byeon.

596
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,700
What brings you here?

597
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,940
It must be an urgent business
for you to come here in person.

598
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,850
I heard a rather peculiar rumor.

599
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,950
A royal agent is here.

600
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,450
A royal agent?
You mean a royal secret agent?

601
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,550
Yes.

602
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,860
He is searching for a girl
who is at your slave market,

603
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,790
so you must close the market
and take caution.

604
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,100
The royal agent may disguise himself
as a customer,

605
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,560
or he may disguise himself as a servant
or a merchant.

606
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:05,710
Does that royal secret agent
have big eyes and a sharp nose?

607
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,510
Over there.

608
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,850
Right there.

609
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,220
What do we do?

610
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,940
Let us finish our discussion.

611
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:46,010
So, will you buy the market
for ten thousand coins?

612
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,790
Yes, I will.

613
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,260
Being it a large amount,
I need to hire men,

614
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,920
so I will return tomorrow with the money.

615
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,690
Of course.

616
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,380
What is the meaning of this?

617
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,290
So many people always try to con me,

618
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:31,290
so I can tell just by looking whether
or not a person is trying to deceive me.

619
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,700
You are a gifted man, Royal Agent.

620
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,040
Is this the man?

621
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:50,510
Good work.

622
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,510
I am quite surprised.

623
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,820
You have become a royal secret agent.

624
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:59,590
I am surprised, too, to learn
you have become a governor.

625
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,290
I was wondering
why there were so many robbers,

626
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,630
and this was the reason.

627
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:11,470
They had you looking out for them,
so they had nothing to fear.

628
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,700
This could have ended up
in the royal agent's hands.

629
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,240
What is this?

630
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,140
They are records of slaves.

631
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,710
Lord Byeon, he came with other men.

632
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,510
What? Where are they?

633
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,710
They are in the main house.

634
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,080
You four go and apprehend them!

635
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,990
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

636
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,690
Come with me.

637
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,840
We must go now.

638
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:53,340
Sir!

639
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,370
Put down your swords!

640
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,710
Look here.

641
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:01,010
The royal agent is in a predicament.

642
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,450
You have messed with the wrong man.

643
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:07,020
We will soon learn which of us
messed with the wrong man.

644
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,690
Apprehend them!

645
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,690
Lord Seong!

646
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,330
No! No!

647
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,730
No!

648
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,070
Apprehend them!

649
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:52,870
Yes, sir!

650
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,210
They are gone.

651
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:10,180
Sir, how did the governor know
who you were?

652
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,450
It was that crafty Bae.

653
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,220
Lord Seong, we do not know
what the governor may do.

654
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,430
Chunsam and I will go to the station
and bring the station guards,

655
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,300
so you return to Jeonju
and prepare to announce yourself.

656
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,130
Your role has ended.

657
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,970
You must return to Hanyang with me.

658
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,310
Assistant Royal Guard Choi,

659
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,910
have you not seen those people
locked up at the slave market?

660
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:37,180
How do you expect me to leave
without rescuing them?

661
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,010
You have no choice
because it is a royal command.

662
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,950
That darn royal command!

663
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,150
Is that royal command more valuable
than people's lives?

664
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,560
Well, the royal command, lives...

665
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,760
He is correct.

666
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,060
Lord Seong.

667
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,930
I should not have gotten you involved.

668
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,800
Return to Hanyang
with him tomorrow morning.

669
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,110
Chunsam and I will bring
the station guards and save them.

670
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,040
I cannot go.

671
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,380
You return by yourself.

672
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,510
We cannot argue here.

673
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,980
Let us leave.

674
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:17,820
Lady Yeongsin!

675
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,590
Darn it.

676
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,290
What am I supposed to do with her?

677
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:27,360
What could you do?

678
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,030
She is not the lady she used to be.

679
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,430
I will convince her to leave,
so do not be concerned.

680
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,400
Lady Yeongsin.

681
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,040
Where did she go? It's dangerous.

682
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,970
Lady Yeongsin!

683
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:44,680
Lord Kim, soon the royal agent
will announce himself.

684
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,450
What should I do?

685
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:50,780
Once he announces himself,
I will be stripped of my position

686
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,950
and perhaps death by poison...

687
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:55,120
You are too timid to be a governor.

688
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,260
Do you have a solution?

689
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,600
If you are afraid of the royal agent,
you can stop him from appearing.

690
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,030
What? You mean stop him with soldiers?

691
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,040
But that is against His Majesty's order,

692
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,310
and I will be charged with treason!
Don't you know?

693
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,540
You and I cannot undo what has happened.

694
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,380
We are like rats driven into a corner,

695
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,320
so we must either attack or be attacked.

696
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,150
Which would you choose?

697
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,460
I would rather attack.

698
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,240
There will be guards everywhere,

699
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,940
so how do we bring the weapons
inside the fortress?

700
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,680
We can bring them in a coffin.

701
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,350
If we report it as a coffin for the dead,
they will let us pass.

702
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,720
We will disguise ourselves
in different clothing

703
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,250
and enter the fortress separately.
Do you understand?

704
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

705
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,460
We will attack
on the last day of the month.

706
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,760
I have sent letters,
so those who wish to join us will gather.

707
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,600
Give them the weapons we have.

708
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,040
When the provincial office gate opens,

709
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,840
Geonju and Gapsik,
you will free the prisoners,

710
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,380
and Mudol and Ungsoe,
you take the armory.

711
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,780
Mandeok, you and I
will go after Byeon Haksu.

712
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,350
Sounds good, Boss.

713
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,020
What will you do after?

714
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:38,560
I will force the King to give an assurance
to ban oppression and exploitation

715
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:43,400
and to build a world where people
can live with dignity.

716
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,480
Have you summoned me?

717
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,220
Listen carefully.

718
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,950
The royal agent will appear soon.

719
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,220
What?

720
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:12,330
You must know that if I am apprehended,
you will not be safe.

721
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,500
So do as I say.

722
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,400
What do you mean?

723
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,170
I will take my soldiers at daybreak

724
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,770
and stand guard at the road
leading to the station.

725
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:30,180
The royal agent cannot be allowed
to summon the station guards.

726
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,920
Do you mean you plan
to apprehend the royal agent?

727
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,680
That is correct.

728
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,450
Do you really mean that?

729
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:44,560
Going after the royal agent
might be too dangerous.

730
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,590
Royal agent?

731
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:50,160
We are only apprehending the man
behind the robbers, do you understand?

732
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:57,100
If everything goes well,
I will take you to Hanyang with me.

733
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,370
Do you mean that?

734
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,540
I give you my word.

735
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,380
I will obey you.

736
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:14,920
He was looking for a girl?

737
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,060
Of course.

738
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,040
Kang Sunae.

739
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,260
We will stay here tonight.

740
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,400
Assistant Royal Guard Choi,
could you please leave us?

741
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:04,640
The royal agent's entourage members
must discuss something in private.

742
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,410
Of course.

743
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,490
Chunsam and I will
take care of things here.

744
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,250
Do you not trust me?

745
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,290
No, I do not.

746
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,160
This is not the first time.

747
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,930
How can I leave
you two troublemakers behind?

748
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,130
You are just as bad.

749
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,670
What?

750
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,910
Two troublemakers are better
than three troublemakers, no?

751
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,010
How dare you?

752
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,810
Troublemaker.

753
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,750
When you joined me here,
you gave me your word to follow my orders.

754
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:47,650
This is an order.

755
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,450
Return to Hanyang
with Assistant Royal Guard Choi,

756
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,420
and report what is happening here.

757
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:05,470
What brings you here so late?

758
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,670
The governor is searching for a girl.

759
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,470
This way.

760
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,380
Show me your faces!

761
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,210
What are you waiting for?

762
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,190
What are you doing? Hurry!

763
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,300
What's taking so long?

764
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,600
Hurry up, you bums!

765
00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:00,420
Here you are, you sly girl.

766
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,330
Open the door.

767
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,810
Please look after Lady Yeongsin.

768
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:19,310
Yes, Lord Seong.

769
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,940
Look after yourself.
I will see you in Hanyang.

770
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:25,750
Assistant Royal Guard Choi.

771
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,950
My Lady, we must go.

772
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,790
You are acting
as if we will never meet again.

773
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,800
There is something I have not told you.

774
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,100
Then save it
for when we meet again in Hanyang.

775
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,040
Are you not curious what it is?

776
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:53,840
I am.

777
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,540
Then why are you not asking?

778
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,610
Would you tell me if I ask?

779
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,650
No.

780
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,550
Pretend I never said anything.

781
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:09,460
Let us go, Assistant Royal Guard Choi.

782
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,840
Chunsam.

783
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,670
Yes, sir.

784
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,640
Let us go and prepare.

785
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,680
Yes, sir.

786
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,940
What is it?

787
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,310
Birds.

788
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,360
That is a bad omen.

789
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,770
Here we are.

790
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:02,700
Come.

791
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,510
Where are you going?

792
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,650
Step aside.

793
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,750
Do you know who he is?

794
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:21,360
I do, Royal Agent Seong.

795
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,290
Are you here to summon the station guards?
