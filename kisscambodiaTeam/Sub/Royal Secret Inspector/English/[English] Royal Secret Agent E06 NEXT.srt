00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,270
EPISODE 6

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,240
Do you have unfinished business with me?

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,440
I am here to negotiate with you.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,540
Negotiate?

5
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,990
Fine. But what is that you are holding?

6
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,030
Don't you know who this is?

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,130
I don't.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,070
I hear he's very famous.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,570
He's the leader of a gang of bandits
who are robbers.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,340
Is that so?

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,650
Doesn't he look like someone?

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,220
I don't know him, so why do you keep
asking me?

13
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,850
You leave me no choice.

14
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,360
I will see the Chief of State Councilor
and tell him who this guy looks like.

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,970
How does he look like me?

16
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,970
How?

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,110
I never said he looked like you.

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,380
Honglang, you!

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,650
I can get another copy of that.

20
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,890
Come inside.

21
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,840
What is it you want?

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,170
Take me with you
on your secret mission.

23
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,510
That is all I ask.

24
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,380
Did the Chief Royal Secretary send you?

25
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,010
No, he does not know about this.

26
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,050
Then how did you know?

27
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,750
Were you eavesdropping?

28
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,820
That used to be my job.

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,630
Tell me the reason.

30
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,200
There is someone I must meet.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Someone you must meet?

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,470
Who is that?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,240
If you allow me to join you,
I will tell you another time.

34
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,810
Why don't we help each other out?

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,410
I can help you find your younger brother.

36
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,210
Lord Seong, are you inside?

37
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,550
Lady Miok, what brings you here?

38
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,990
I came to discuss something with you.

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,590
Is someone inside?

40
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,790
Oh, those?

41
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,060
There's no one in there.

42
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,310
Please consider it.

43
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,150
Did you get a concubine already?

44
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,620
Concubine?

45
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,090
She looks like she has been around.

46
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,200
So, do you like her?

47
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,900
She's not...

48
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,940
You have a graceful figure,

49
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,510
but your tongue is vulgar.

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,410
What?

51
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,109
How dare you...

52
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,580
Calm yourself down.

53
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,690
Do you expect me to take such humiliation
from a lowly girl like her?

54
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,560
She deserves your respect.

55
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,660
What?

56
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,970
Come.

57
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,390
It looks like the wedding is off.

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,690
I am glad.

59
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,890
I was planning on turning her down anyway.

60
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,900
You win.

61
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,280
Is anyone inside?

62
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,530
Hey.

63
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,770
Hey.

64
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,540
Your Majesty,
Special Advisor Seong Igyeom is here.

65
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,710
Let him enter.

66
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,359
Your Majesty.

67
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,230
You suffered great ordeals
on your last secret mission,

68
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,930
so I am grateful you have volunteered.

69
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,500
I am infinitely honored, Your Majesty.

70
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,570
The greedy and tyrannical local officials

71
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,670
have devastated the lives of my subjects,

72
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,410
and driven by severe poverty,
they turned to robbery.

73
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,970
Someone must put a stop to that.

74
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,240
Royal Secret Agent Seong Igyeom,

75
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,320
go to Chungcheong and Jeolla areas
where robbers are raising havoc,

76
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,290
and observe the tripartite disorder
of the local government officials,

77
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,890
and console my subjects' hearts.

78
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,560
I, Seong Igyeom, will obey your order.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,770
I received a report of a robbery
of a nobleman's house in Chungju.

80
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,140
Start your investigation there.

81
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,960
I will see you again.

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,870
What is this?

83
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,100
It's your second mission.

84
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,340
A second mission?

85
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,480
What happened?

86
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,320
I went to pay a visit to the guard
who found the bodies,

87
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,920
but he was already dead.

88
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,860
What?

89
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,230
It has begun again.

90
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,230
What do you mean by that?

91
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,379
I mean their terrible illness.

92
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,550
They eliminate
whatever stands in their way.

93
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,119
So the reason why they killed the guard...

94
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,250
He saw something he shouldn't have.

95
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,490
What could that be?

96
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,890
That the prisoners' deaths

97
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,700
were not suicides but murders.

98
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,770
Let us hurry. Dain is waiting.

99
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,340
What? Lady Dain?

100
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,570
We are going with Lady Dain again?

101
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,110
Yes, we are.

102
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,440
That's great.

103
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,340
Are you pleased?

104
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,810
Of course!

105
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,180
Wait. Sir, you're not...

106
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,490
I'm not what?

107
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,490
I mean, Lady Dain...

108
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,160
What about Dain? What?

109
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,660
Fine! She begged me to let her join us,

110
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,200
so I took a chance and said yes. So what?

111
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,300
Are you implying that
I have feelings for her?

112
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,110
Sir, do you have feelings for Lady Dain?

113
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,670
But you just...

114
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,210
I was about to ask you if you want
to take her as your servant.

115
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,450
Forget it. Let's go.

116
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,690
Feelings...

117
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,590
Lord Kim, what brings you here?

118
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,900
You belittled my father
and humiliated my sister.

119
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
Humiliated her? What do you mean?

120
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,230
Be quiet. Everyone!

121
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,100
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,500
Teach him a lesson.

123
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,840
Lord Kim, what are you doing?

124
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,920
Where are you going?

125
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,290
Chunsam!

126
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,360
Sir!

127
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,400
Sir, sir!

128
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,010
Stop it!

129
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,610
We are leaving.

130
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,350
Sir.

131
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,360
Sir, this is not a good way to start.

132
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,860
Must we go?

133
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,300
Be quiet.

134
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,000
What? A royal secret agent?

135
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,940
Yes, I saw his horse acquisition tablet.

136
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,270
It must be
the Chief Royal Secretary's doing.

137
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,780
Father, this might be our chance.

138
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,640
What chance?

139
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,750
This may be our chance to get rid of him.

140
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,980
You said he will become our enemy.

141
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,790
Have you forgotten about Park Cheolgyu?

142
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,390
Going after a royal agent
may complicate things even further.

143
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,890
Do you know where he went?

144
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,760
I put a tail on him.

145
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,430
We must find out about his mission.

146
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,830
Keep a close eye on him.

147
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,580
What took you so long?

148
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,050
We are running very late.

149
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,750
Lady Dain, we were about to leave when...

150
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,650
Hey!

151
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,520
Let us go. We have a long journey ahead.

152
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,350
Yes, Lord Seong.

153
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,160
Lady Dain, go ahead.

154
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,460
What is my second mission?

155
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,000
Pay a visit to Governor Kim Myeongse
of Jeolla Province.

156
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,140
For what reason?

157
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,770
He is one of the few men who knows
the truth about Prince Hwiyeong's death.

158
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,580
Find out the truth.

159
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,950
Does it have something to do with Dain?

160
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,120
You will find out when you return
after completing your mission.

161
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,490
Tell me the reason.

162
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,690
There is someone I must meet.

163
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,040
Sir, what are you waiting for?

164
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Come.

165
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,550
Dain, are you inside?

166
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,290
Dain.

167
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,930
You are like a father to me.

168
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,740
The kindness you've shown
by taking me in and raising me,

169
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,840
I could never repay.

170
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,180
I will be your burden no more.

171
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,080
Oh, that stubborn girl.

172
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,130
Let us rest here.

173
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes, sir.

174
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,350
Chunsam,

175
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,850
do you know anything
about Lord Seong's younger brother?

176
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,890
Lord Ibeom?

177
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,790
Yes.

178
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,060
Of course I do.

179
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,660
Although he is his half-brother,

180
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,960
Lord Igyeom treated him
like his real brother.

181
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,830
They were very close.

182
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,100
But he coveted his older brother's woman.

183
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,870
Lord Igyeom must be miserable inside.

184
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,100
Haven't you noticed?

185
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,970
Sometimes he is not himself.

186
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,810
Come to think of it, you may be right.

187
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,910
Anyway, I feel very reassured
about having you with us.

188
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,450
The thought of being alone with him
gives me the chills.

189
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,220
Thank you so, so much.

190
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,790
There's no need to thank her.

191
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
Sir, don't be like that.

192
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,030
Aren't you happy that
Lady Dain is coming with us?

193
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,630
Do not make a fuss.

194
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,200
I do not want her company.

195
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,030
What?

196
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,170
I thought you wanted to bring her with us.

197
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,570
Isn't that why you taught her to shoot
and gave her a gift?

198
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,470
That...

199
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,110
Maybe I fell for her seduction.

200
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,410
Seduction?

201
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,280
Who seduced whom?

202
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,620
Someone told me

203
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,390
that you are good at seducing people.

204
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,460
Compared to you, I have much to learn.

205
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,460
Your tongue must be as sweet as honey

206
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,030
for the Chief State Councilor's daughter
to visit you at home.

207
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,770
You should teach me your secrets.

208
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,440
Behave yourself.

209
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,810
Who's next?

210
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,880
Will you seduce a princess?

211
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,680
How dare you!

212
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,620
Oh, I was mad to bring you along.

213
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,790
What's wrong with you guys?

214
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,020
Have you forgotten already?

215
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,460
We saved each other's life!

216
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,760
Sir, she saved your life.

217
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,530
Lady Dain, if Lord Igyeom hadn't saved you
at the cliff, you'd be dead!

218
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,030
Have you forgotten?
We are on the same side!

219
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,570
I was too harsh.

220
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,770
I apologize.

221
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,580
I didn't mean what I said.

222
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,850
You look good dressed as a man,
and it suits your character.

223
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,990
Maybe you should consider living as a man.

224
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,190
How about that?

225
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,490
Is that so?

226
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,430
It seems the word "petty"

227
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,930
suits you much better than "scoundrel."

228
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,600
A petty person.

229
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,640
What? Petty?

230
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,670
Yes, petty.

231
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,340
Are you in love with each other?

232
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,069
- What?
- What?

233
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,870
How dare you!

234
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,680
Are you mad?

235
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,740
Stop it! Stop!

236
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,450
After this secret mission,

237
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,880
you two will never see each other again.

238
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,280
Do you understand?

239
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,150
Being stuck in the middle of you two
will kill me before my time. Ugh!

240
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,300
Welcome.

241
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,440
You must have traveled far.

242
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,780
Sit here.

243
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,640
Thank you.

244
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,580
Enjoy.

245
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Thank you.

246
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,560
They are impressive.

247
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,560
How can they only rob
the bad noblemen's houses?

248
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,970
It looks like the gang of bandits
haven't struck this town.

249
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,470
It's very quiet here.

250
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,070
Have you seen the gang of bandits?

251
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,610
How could we, when they are so elusive?

252
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,810
We came from the neighboring town,
and the bandits left a big mess there.

253
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,050
Hostess, do you have rooms available?

254
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,550
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,160
I don't have a room. You must share.

256
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,960
Share?

257
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,590
Are you still interested?

258
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,030
We have no choice.

259
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,270
Roommates.

260
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,470
Go in.

261
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,820
May we join you?

262
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,500
Sleep over there.

263
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,510
Roommates!

264
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,540
Oh, no, it will be a long night.

265
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,080
Can we join you?

266
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,550
Find a spot.

267
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,990
Wait!

268
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,430
Hey.

269
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,060
Get away from me.

270
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,030
I would love to.

271
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,900
Stop pushing.

272
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,230
I am being pushed.

273
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,650
Why did you get up so early?

274
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,150
I couldn't sleep.

275
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,760
Is something on your mind?

276
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,930
Someone next to me was snoring away,

277
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,460
so how could I sleep?

278
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,070
M-Me? I snored?

279
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,140
You also grind your teeth.

280
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
I never...

281
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,540
I couldn't sleep either.

282
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,580
Why did you keep

283
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,150
gently stroking my head?

284
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,100
You weren't asleep?

285
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,600
I was, but I was awakened.

286
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,470
Because you kept doing it.

287
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,150
But you didn't move.

288
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,120
I guess you didn't hate it.

289
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,660
Gosh.

290
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,160
Oh! I don't know who,

291
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,400
but the woman who has to share
a bed with you will be miserable!

292
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,570
That means you will be miserable.

293
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,840
What? Me?

294
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,750
We still have a long journey ahead of us.

295
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,780
And we will spend many nights together.

296
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,720
Oh, th-that's right.

297
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,030
I will be miserable.

298
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,800
Dain.

299
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,130
Yes?

300
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,570
What is it now?

301
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,570
I don't mind

302
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,080
if you snore or grind your teeth.

303
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,290
But you said earlier that you couldn't
sleep because of my teeth grinding.

304
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,660
You can grind your teeth
all the way down to your gums.

305
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,580
I was harsh earlier.

306
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,710
I apologize.

307
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,060
I apologize too.

308
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,090
Don't worry.

309
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,690
We are risking our lives for this job

310
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,660
without knowing much about each other.

311
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,870
If you have any questions for me,

312
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,500
you can ask me directly from now on.

313
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,400
May I really?

314
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,070
Yes.

315
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:48,820
So, do you still have those dreams?

316
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,920
I heard you lost your beloved
because of your younger brother.

317
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,130
Did Chunsam tell you?

318
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,200
Yes.

319
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,230
He talks too much.

320
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,010
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

321
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,280
Ibeom and Sunae
were the most important people to me.

322
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,290
I went looking for them after that day,

323
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,860
but I couldn't find any trace.

324
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,330
Time passed, and I consoled myself
by telling me that no news is good news.

325
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,670
But...

326
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,270
After all this time...

327
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,780
He appeared but as the leader of robbers.

328
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,990
Do not blame so much.

329
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,790
I don't blame him.

330
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,960
No.

331
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,170
Do not blame yourself.

332
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,730
You two are early risers.

333
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,560
I got up because I must be somewhere
very early.

334
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,830
Go back to your business.

335
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,570
Goodbye.

336
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,680
You should get some sleep.

337
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,610
You go ahead.

338
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,150
Pardon me.

339
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,860
Lord Seong!

340
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,100
Our money is gone.

341
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,870
Who would take it?

342
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,910
It was him.

343
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,740
What? Sir, what's wrong?

344
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,950
Let's split apart and look for him.

345
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,480
Yes, sir.

346
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,180
Yes, Lord Seong.

347
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,660
That way.

348
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,770
Madam, ma...

349
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:09,090
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

350
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,654
Madam, ma...

351
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,750
Madam!

352
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,720
Lord Seong, who is this woman?

353
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,610
Lord Seong!

354
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,750
I will check inside the house.

355
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,190
You check to see if anyone is alive.

356
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,120
What? Me?

357
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,430
Madam.

358
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,040
Sir.

359
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,110
They all look dead.

360
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,280
Anyone there? Is anyone inside?

361
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,920
- Everyone looks dead.
- Lady Dain.

362
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,090
Why is everyone lying on the ground?

363
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:40,830
Chunsam.

364
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,500
What's this?

365
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,530
Blood, blood!

366
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,870
Chunsam, check to see if anyone is alive.

367
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,570
M-Me?

368
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,540
Yes.

369
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,640
But why should I?

370
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,770
Hurry.

371
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,280
Sir!

372
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,250
From noblemen to slaves,
everyone got murdered.

373
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,850
This can't be one man's doing.

374
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,120
Sir, c-could it be Lord Ibeom?

375
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,530
The sun will come up soon, so let us
report this to the government office.

376
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,250
The patrolmen arrived long ago,
so where is the magistrate?

377
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,990
Make way!

378
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,260
Make way! Make way.

379
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,540
What's wrong? Do you know him?

380
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,110
I do.

381
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,640
He is very evil.

382
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,840
He was a secretary
with the Ministry of Justice.

383
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,680
He lied about getting punishments reduced

384
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,110
and took bribes from the family members
of the criminals.

385
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,820
Shame on him.

386
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,450
How do you know so well?

387
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,760
I surveilled him under the order
of the Chief Royal Secretary.

388
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,320
You exposed him.

389
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,760
Yes. He was exiled,

390
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,730
but it seems he was reinstated
as a sheriff.

391
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,600
He wouldn't recognize you, would he?

392
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,540
I looked just like this.

393
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,310
What?

394
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,180
You have enemies everywhere.

395
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,180
I know.

396
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,390
If he was in the Ministry of Justice,
he must at least be a good investigator.

397
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,450
Let's keep an eye on him.

398
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,240
Get rid of them.

399
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,100
Yes, sir.

400
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,470
Get rid of them.

401
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,310
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:13,880
Their money is missing,
so it must be a robbery.

403
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,050
A gang of robbers attacked

404
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,490
a nobleman's house
in the neighboring town.

405
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,590
Yes, I also heard that.

406
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,390
They call those robbers
a gang of bandits, I heard.

407
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,890
Yes, that is correct.

408
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,660
Even people in Hanyang know about them.

409
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,830
It must be them.

410
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,970
Search for the gang of bandits.

411
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,910
This will justify my excuse
to leave this tiny town.

412
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,840
Make way!

413
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,310
Make way!

414
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,020
It's already over?

415
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,590
I knew it. People don't change.

416
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,030
Listen!

417
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,600
It was the bandits who murdered
Lord Lee and his family!

418
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,330
- Bandits?
- Bandits!

419
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,500
If you have seen them or have information,
report to the government office!

420
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,770
Do you really think it was Lord Ibeom?

421
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,780
What's going on?

422
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,990
Lord Lee was murdered by the bandits
last night.

423
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,620
He was robbed by the bandits?

424
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,990
You reap what you sow.

425
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,090
What do you mean by that?

426
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,460
So many people of this town held grudges
against Lord Lee.

427
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:37,300
Is that true?

428
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,330
He was an infamous usurer.

429
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,040
I wonder why the bandits don't attack
the gambling house.

430
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,640
What gambling house?

431
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,840
You, it's you!

432
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,010
Oh!

433
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:53,980
It's you!

434
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,179
Dang it.

435
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,719
Stop right there!

436
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,060
You!

437
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,100
Hey!

438
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,050
You stop right there!

439
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,520
Oh, my heart.

440
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,620
You couldn't catch a snail at that speed!

441
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,420
What? What did you say?

442
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,730
That prick.

443
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,300
Where is our money?

444
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,270
Lady Dain.

445
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,470
You lost all of it?

446
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,170
Yes.

447
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,010
Where?

448
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,410
Tell us, before I...

449
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,050
I lost it at the gambling house.

450
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,250
Gambling house?
There is a gambling house in this town?

451
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,790
Earlier, you said you wondered why

452
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,160
the bandits haven't attacked
the gambling house.

453
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,360
Did I?

454
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,730
Be honest with me!

455
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,760
Is there a reason why the bandits
might be interested?

456
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,040
The gambling house here
is of no average scale.

457
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,070
At least a thousand brass coins
collect there a day.

458
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,540
A thousand?

459
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,310
The gambling house is where
all the troublemakers gather.

460
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,250
Lead us there.

461
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,120
Listen carefully.

462
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,620
The guard inside the gambling house
is not heavy,

463
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,330
but there are ruffians so be cautious.

464
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,090
Wait for my signal before you move.

465
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,460
We only want the safe.

466
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,470
Understand?

467
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,300
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

468
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,050
That's the place.

469
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,820
The sheriff hasn't done anything
about a place like that?

470
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,290
Chunsam, take this man
to the government office.

471
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,920
Can I take a look around?

472
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,120
What did you say?

473
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,290
You want to gamble again?
You want to die?

474
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,590
Please spare me.

475
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,160
Serving time is the only way
for you to live, understand?

476
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,530
We'll go.

477
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,800
Come!

478
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,040
You come with me.

479
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,900
Yes, Lord Seong.

480
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,610
They must charge money to enter.
What should we do?

481
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,650
If you have a money pouch, let me have it.

482
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,620
A money pouch?

483
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,960
But it's empty. What will you do?

484
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,510
Good job.

485
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,540
This is too much.

486
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,810
Don't be too grateful.

487
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,130
Darn it.

488
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,400
Go and check the inside.

489
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,430
Yes, sir.

490
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,150
If the bandits know about this place,

491
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,780
they wouldn't pass by it.

492
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,350
I agree with you.

493
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,360
Welcome.

494
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,060
You guys are new.

495
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,430
Oh, you are so handsome.

496
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,530
I bet you hear that often.

497
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,410
Such a handsome man would have
caused a stir in town.

498
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,980
Why haven't I heard about you?

499
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,710
I know.

500
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,790
Come this way.

501
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,000
Have a seat here.

502
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,970
Enjoy yourselves.

503
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,910
I didn't know such place existed.

504
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,480
I've seen many gambling houses,

505
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,390
but none as big as this one.

506
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,490
Sit down.

507
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,430
What's wrong?

508
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,400
If we only watch, they will suspect us.

509
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,170
We should at least try this.

510
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,420
Do you know how to gamble?

511
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,890
Do I know?

512
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,000
I became a royal agent thanks to this.

513
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,830
What?

514
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,570
Never mind.

515
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,970
Do you know how to play?

516
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,070
I picked up a few tricks
at the courtesan house.

517
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,970
What will you bet?

518
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,240
Are you being serious?

519
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,350
Let's make it more exciting while at it.

520
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,950
In that case, doing what the winner asks.

521
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,250
How about that?

522
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,420
Sure.

523
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,390
Pick first.

524
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,400
When I stand up
and throw the strips down, we begin.

525
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,270
Subdue the armed ruffians first.

526
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:31,040
Afterward, you and you will
gather people into one place,

527
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,250
and the rest of you will collect money.
Do you understand?

528
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,420
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

529
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,180
Come.

530
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,660
Two eights.

531
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,200
I'm sorry.

532
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,670
Two tens.

533
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,410
What?

534
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,810
You always lost, didn't you?

535
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,850
How did you know?

536
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,680
May I tell you what I want?

537
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,290
Yes, go ahead.

538
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,430
After the mission is completed,

539
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,400
there is someone I must meet.

540
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,960
The governor of Jeolla Province, you mean?

541
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,570
How did you know?

542
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,140
The Chief Royal Secretary
gave me a mission.

543
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,510
Meeting him is my second mission.

544
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,080
You knew that had something to do with me,

545
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,150
so why didn't you ask me for the reason?

546
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,480
I don't care what the reason is.

547
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,390
Everyone has a past
they want to keep hidden.

548
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,700
Well, I will tell you my wish.

549
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,770
Until the mission is complete,

550
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,510
stay with me.

551
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,810
Is that what you want?

552
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,850
Yes.

553
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,690
Why are you laughing?

554
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,520
That is no big deal.

555
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,520
I was planning on doing that anyway.

556
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,530
Welcome, sir.

557
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,640
Do you have a nice table for us?

558
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,040
Of course. Come this way.

559
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,080
Let us play one more round.

560
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,880
What?

561
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,020
Lord Seong, we are not here to gamble.

562
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,490
Yes, you are right.

563
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,630
Gambling is highly addictive.

564
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,930
Fine. Let us play one final round.

565
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,470
This has to be

566
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,940
the final round.

567
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,420
What is that place?

568
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,820
It is a gambling house.

569
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,220
What? A gambling house?

570
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,020
Yes.

571
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,190
How brazen of them.

572
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,100
Go straight to Hanyang and tell Lord Kim

573
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,870
that the royal agent is neck deep
in gambling and hedonism.

574
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,770
Yes, sir.

575
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,640
Things are getting interesting.

576
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,550
Hurry up and come.

577
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,710
Come right now.

578
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,720
What is your business?

579
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,850
Is the Sheriff inside?

580
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,490
He is out.

581
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:01,790
He is always out.

582
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,930
Oh, he went there.

583
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,330
There where?

584
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:08,060
To gamble.

585
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,300
I bet he went to the gambling house.

586
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,270
The Sheriff went to the gambling house?

587
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,840
Hey,

588
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,170
how dare you run your mouth here?

589
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,740
Get lost!

590
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,870
I brought a criminal.

591
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,740
Hey!

592
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,710
Out of my way!

593
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,450
Hey! Wait, wait.

594
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,710
If the Sheriff went to the gambling house,

595
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,580
Lady Dain.

596
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,890
Lady Dain, Lady Dain!

597
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,830
Sir!

598
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,000
What took you so long?

599
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,100
I had things to take care of.

600
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,000
I will take you to a nice table.

601
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,420
You!

602
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,230
Ill-fated ties are never easily broken,

603
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,500
so we meet again.

604
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,270
You owe me something.

605
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,740
Owe you?

606
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,770
Have you not realized your mistakes?

607
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:25,740
What?

608
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,110
I told you I will kill you
if we ever meet again.

609
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,750
I guess today is that day.

610
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,920
I will take your life for it.

611
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,590
Grab this girl.

612
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,350
Yes, sir.

613
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,430
We are here to gamble.

614
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,560
Let her go.

615
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,430
Let her go?

616
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,730
You must be in this together.

617
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,470
Lord Seong!

618
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,770
This is nothing so don't mind us,

619
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,780
and keep enjoying yourselves.

620
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,510
Bring her!

621
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,480
Yes, sir.

622
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,640
Let her go!

623
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,090
Let me see your hand.

624
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,860
Hey, what are you waiting for?
Show me your hand!

625
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,500
I fold.

626
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,700
Lord Seong.

627
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,630
I am fine.

628
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:30,870
I'm impressed.

629
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,170
Put the swords away.

630
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,580
You have spirit.

631
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,820
If you want to fight that bad,

632
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,850
why not play a round against me?

633
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,390
If you win, you can take her.

634
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,860
If I win, on top of her life,

635
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,900
I will take yours too.

636
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,470
What do you say?

637
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,500
No, Lord Seong. Don't do it.

638
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,200
This is a trick.

639
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,680
Do you think I will lose?

640
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,610
Yes.

641
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,920
If I win, will you grant my wish?

642
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,750
What?

643
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,690
How could you say such a thing
at a moment like this?

644
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,620
Answer me.

645
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,830
You were so bold before,
but you must be scared now.

646
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,400
I will.

647
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,670
Fine.

648
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:40,970
Good.

649
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:42,910
Set the table.

650
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:54,020
Maehyang, watch them
and make sure they don't flee.

651
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:55,390
Yes, sir.

652
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,090
I knew it.

653
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,260
No man can be this beautiful.

654
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,730
This is so exciting.

655
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,170
Come and place your bets!

656
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,510
This is not your ordinary game!

657
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:16,840
A match where a young man's life
is on the line is about to begin!

658
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,810
Place your bets!

659
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,750
Sixty coins on the young man.

660
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,850
Pick.

661
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,530
Lord Seong, how is it going?

662
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,100
Oh no.

663
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,440
Show me your hand.

664
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,610
Two nines.

665
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,350
- Two nines!
- Two nines!

666
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:54,810
Two tens?

667
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,380
- Two tens!
- Two tens!

668
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,810
What?

669
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,650
Two tens?

670
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,290
We're done for today.

671
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:09,060
Yes, sir.

672
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,400
Thank you for a great game.

673
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,110
Stop.

674
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,580
How dare you try to deceive me?

675
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,750
Sir!

676
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,930
Get him!

677
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,640
Sir! Lady Dain!

678
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,810
Why? What's wrong?

679
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,580
That way!

680
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,550
Darn it!

681
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,150
Gather the patrolmen!

682
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,190
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

683
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,690
Wait, wait.

684
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:26,770
What happened?

685
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,240
Did you already meet the Sheriff?

686
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,270
Yes.

687
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,070
He holds a deep grudge against Dain.

688
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,110
But good for you for making it out alive.

689
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:36,640
Thanks to me.

690
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,610
I used the skills I developed in gambling
and saved our lives.

691
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:40,910
I knew it.

692
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,320
I want to ask you what happened.

693
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,220
What I saw was a one and a ten.

694
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,920
You did.

695
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,990
So?

696
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,190
How did they become two tens?

697
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:53,060
Actually...

698
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,660
One final round.

699
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,860
This is the final round.

700
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,200
When I was playing against you,

701
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,740
I hid one so I can beat you.

702
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,570
What?

703
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,240
Was that why you asked me to play
one more round?

704
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,940
Yes, because I knew I would win.

705
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,410
Would I bet my life in vain?

706
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,180
Wow, you are really...

707
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,780
No one can compete with you
when it comes to nerves.

708
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,720
You haven't forgotten the promise
you made, have you?

709
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,390
What promise?

710
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,660
If I win, you said you would
grant my wish.

711
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,660
But you did not win fairly.

712
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,300
A win is a win.

713
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,070
Fine. Tell me what it is.

714
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,050
What's wrong?

715
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:56,820
It's nothing.

716
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,860
Did you hand that man
over to the government office?

717
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,760
Yes.

718
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,870
Good.

719
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,770
I need to look into something.

720
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,670
Dain, go to the post station with Chunsam

721
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,100
and have the men get ready.

722
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,510
Are you going to make your appearance?

723
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:15,640
Yes, I am making my appearance
tomorrow at the government office.

724
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,510
Yes, Lord Seong.

725
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,140
- Come.
- Yes, Lady Dain.

726
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,420
What is it?

727
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,050
You gambled, which is illegal by law.

728
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,020
Out of my way.

729
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:12,770
Lady Dain, come.

730
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,470
Hey, you two, stop right there.

731
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,850
Lady Dain, you go ahead.

732
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,010
Chunsam.

733
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,480
I will deal with them.

734
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,220
Chunsam,

735
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,290
thank you.

736
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:39,560
Where are you going?

737
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:41,930
Lady Dain!

738
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,430
I am fine!

739
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,530
Please go!

740
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,740
- It's fine.
- I don't mind dying,

741
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,640
so please live happily ever after
all by yourself!

742
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,210
But please remember Park Chunsam!

743
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,480
Darn it.

744
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,580
Stop it! You will kill him.

745
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,120
Chunsam, Chunsam!

746
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,090
Lady Dain, why have you returned?

747
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,560
I said I am fine.

748
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,990
You don't look fine at all.

749
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,530
But I am.

750
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,940
This isn't the path
to the government office.

751
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,610
You! Where are you taking me?

752
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,110
You sure are chatty. You'll find out.

753
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,610
What are you doing?

754
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,780
Let go of me!

755
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:42,220
Don't you know why you were brought here?

756
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,520
Oh,

757
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,960
gambling is just for entertainment.

758
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,530
I will show you what happens
when you cheat at gambling.

759
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,770
Who are you accusing of cheating?

760
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,800
After you left, I counted the strips.

761
00:55:58,570 --> 00:55:59,340
Here.

762
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,040
Do you still deny it?

763
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,010
Oh, that?

764
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,550
Everyone does that in Hanyang.

765
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,850
It must be a regional difference.

766
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:12,320
Regional difference is nonsense.

767
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,690
Enough of this absurdity!

768
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,460
Lord Seong!

769
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:19,030
Sir!

770
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,790
Dain.

771
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,300
Are you all right?

772
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,330
How about you? Are you hurt?

773
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,270
What do you think you're doing?

774
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:28,670
Get that girl up.

775
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,500
Come.

776
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,510
You were once a secretary
of the Ministry of Justice,

777
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,240
but now you've become a worthless gambler.

778
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,250
Yes, you are as insolent as ever.

779
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,720
Bring her to me.

780
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,260
Lady Dain, Lady Dain!

781
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,570
I will cut out your tongue first.

782
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:01,540
No!

783
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:05,140
Sir!

784
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,830
Stop!

785
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,030
I will teach you a lesson!

786
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:34,770
Dain!

787
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:07,700
Who are you?

788
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,340
They are the bandits.

789
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,240
Bandits?

790
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:15,880
What are you waiting for?
Apprehend them!

791
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,780
Put down your weapons.

792
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,810
You idiots.

793
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,050
So you were all in this together.

794
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,120
You will never leave this town alive.

795
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,950
I will kill every one of you
by tearing your limbs apart.

796
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,390
Just you wait.

797
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,100
We finally meet.

798
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,350
It's been a long time, Brother.

799
01:00:11,627 --> 01:00:14,659
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

800
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,300
<i>Must you go inside?</i>

801
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,130
<i>Every crime scene holds clues.</i>

802
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,100
<i>This is odd.</i>

803
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,000
<i>I've noticed too.</i>

804
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,070
<i>Everything is in order,</i>

805
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,300
<i>as if someone cleaned it.</i>

806
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,840
<i>I heard of carts going into that house.</i>

807
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,410
<i>Are they moving the profit
from the gambling house to here?</i>

808
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,680
<i>I heard the ledger is in there.</i>

809
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,240
<i>What about the ledger?</i>

810
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,110
<i>Did you kill Lord Lee and his family?</i>

811
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:35,180
<i>No matter what I say,
you won't believe me.</i>

812
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,720
<i>Are the rumors true?</i>

813
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,820
<i>I only returned what they have lost!</i>

814
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,590
<i>Then make me believe you.</i>
