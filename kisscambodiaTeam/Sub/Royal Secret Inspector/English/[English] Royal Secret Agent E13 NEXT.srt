EPISODE 13

2
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:52,065
So, this was what you were searching for.

3
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,829
Do you know how much humiliation
I suffered because of you?

4
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,470
I will kill you very slowly
and very painfully,

5
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:17,440
until you beg me to end your life.

6
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,380
Lord Seong.

7
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:29,180
Sir, are you all right?

8
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,980
I am fine.

9
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,150
You pest!

10
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,519
Stop. He is an important witness.

11
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,530
Witness? What do you mean?

12
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,170
Is he...?

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,900
He is the one who murdered your father.

14
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,710
Sir, I found this in his hand.

15
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,679
Take it.

16
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:07,820
This is what you were searching for.

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,600
Prince Hwiyeong was not a traitor.

18
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,440
Lord Seong.

19
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,880
Sir, you must hold on.

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,820
I will fetch a doctor.

21
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,250
My entire body feels weak.

22
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,390
I am sleepy.

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,960
You cannot fall asleep, sir!

24
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,130
Chunsam.

25
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,360
I would like to rest.

26
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,310
Lord Seong, Lord Seong!

27
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,540
Sir! Sir!

28
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,179
- Wake up, Lord Seong.
- Sir!

29
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,110
No! No!

30
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,610
Chunsam, hurry and go fetch a doctor.

31
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,920
I will.

32
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,620
No! No!

33
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,650
Lord Seong, Lord Seong.

34
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,790
Lord Seong!

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,960
No, no, no!

36
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,530
Out of my way! Out of my way!

37
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,100
Chunsam.

38
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,100
L-Lord Ibeom.

39
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,870
This way.

40
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,870
Igyeom!

41
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,480
Lord Seong, Lord Seong.

42
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,280
Is this the man
who harmed the royal agent?

43
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,120
Yes.

44
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,390
Take him.

45
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,090
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,660
We must move him.

47
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,730
Come with me.

48
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,540
Doctor, Doctor!

49
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,670
Boss!

50
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,570
Doctor, he needs help.

51
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,810
He was hit by an arrow
and lost much blood.

52
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,150
Get in, bastard.

53
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,390
That is the man!

54
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,000
That is the man who attacked us!

55
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,500
You!

56
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,430
Stop it!

57
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,010
He is an important witness.

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,980
I want to end his life with my own hands,

59
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,220
but to clear the royal agent's name
and find the man behind everything,

60
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,520
we need him.

61
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,860
He will receive just punishment,
so please let us take him.

62
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,330
I beg of you.

63
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,050
I am finished. He should get rest
for now and not strain himself.

64
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,190
Thank you.

65
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,640
I should go.

66
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,070
Thank you.

67
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,540
We owe you.
Thank you for helping.

68
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,580
Do not mention it.
Please look after my brother.

69
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,580
Wait.

70
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,430
Lord Igyeom always thinks of you
and worries for you.

71
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,100
When he wakes up, please tell him
he should free himself from the burden.

72
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,690
Your Majesty, please give us your order.

73
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,160
Must the Chief Royal Secretary...

74
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,130
Be executed?

75
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,460
Feigning King's command

76
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,200
and creating disturbance in the government
with the daughter of a traitor,

77
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,770
no other crime is as grave as these.

78
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,840
Please give us your order.

79
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,940
I will consider it for the next few days.

80
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,550
You may leave.

81
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,120
Your Majesty, execute
the Chief Royal Secretary,

82
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,720
and restore order in the government.

83
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,860
Stop!

84
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,190
Do I not even have the freedom to decide
on a matter such as this?

85
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,500
A man's life depends on my decision.

86
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,630
Does it not deserve more caution?

87
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,610
As you wish, Your Majesty.

88
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,560
I brought you good news.

89
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,600
His Majesty has allowed you
a few more days to live.

90
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,440
Are you eternally grateful?

91
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,769
Although you are imprisoned,
is it not better to be alive than dead?

92
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,880
Lord Kim,

93
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,220
do you fear death that much?

94
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,060
What?

95
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,230
Whichever crime you frame me to kill me,

96
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:30,040
I am without one bit of shame,
so I will face it with my head held high.

97
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,680
But would you be able to do the same?

98
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,150
I doubt it.

99
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,650
Lord Seong.

100
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,020
Are you awake?

101
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,420
What happened?

102
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,360
You lost consciousness,
so your younger brother brought you here.

103
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,260
Ibeom?

104
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
Yes.

105
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,100
Please lie back down.

106
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,200
You must rest.

107
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,810
No, we have no time to waste.

108
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,510
Get ready. Let us return to Hanyang.

109
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,650
Sir! Sir!

110
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,580
Sir!

111
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,820
You are hurting me. Stop.

112
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,130
What happened to your handsome face?

113
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,860
You are ugly.

114
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,930
That is enough.

115
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,180
I can kill you this instant.

116
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,480
Kill me.

117
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,190
Will you not have any regrets?

118
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,390
I will not.

119
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,230
You were born a man but lived as a beast,
but you still have no regrets.

120
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,970
Confess all of your crimes
before His Majesty.

121
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,840
And I will give you
the chance to live as a man.

122
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,480
I do not know what living as a man is,

123
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,220
but you can do it, to live as a man.

124
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,420
I cannot believe my ears,
you rude bastard.

125
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,760
Stop.

126
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,060
We have a long journey,
so we must hurry.

127
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,330
Get ready.

128
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,260
Yes, sir.

129
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,440
Do you still wish to start a revolution?

130
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,740
The royal agent was here,
so the governor will pay for his crimes.

131
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,440
That remains to be seen.

132
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,410
Boss!

133
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,680
There is a strange rumor.

134
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,990
What strange rumor?

135
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,420
They say Governor Kim Myeongse is dead.

136
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,660
What happened?

137
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,190
There are no details,

138
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,760
but everyone in the provincial office
has been ordered to remain silent

139
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,660
to prevent disorder.

140
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,870
Boss, now that he is dead,
should we not hold a feast?

141
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,400
Stop the foolish nonsense.

142
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,170
Whoever it is, a new governor will arrive.

143
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,680
I am concerned what kind of man he is.

144
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,560
Sir, drink some water.

145
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,100
You go ahead.

146
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,440
Lord Seong.

147
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,120
Get him some water.

148
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,250
What?

149
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,260
Sir, he tried to kill you,
so why...

150
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,830
Look at him drink.

151
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,040
Is your thirst gone?

152
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,980
There are many in this world
who suffer from burning thirst.

153
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,390
I am the man
who brings them a sip of water,

154
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,230
and you are the man
who steals that water.

155
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,700
Who do you think is living as a man?

156
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,940
Let us go.

157
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,440
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes.

158
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,060
Your Majesty, have you decided?

159
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,770
Do as you wish.

160
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,910
Your Majesty, I am happy to hear that.

161
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,150
Bring the prisoner!

162
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,130
Prisoner, hear this.

163
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,030
According to the King's command,
your limbs will be severed,

164
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,200
and they will be scattered
around the country.

165
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,370
How do you feel?

166
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,470
Can you still face death
with your head held high?

167
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,410
Remember my death.

168
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,020
Your death will not differ much from mine.

169
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,830
Let me see if you can still say the same
after your head has been cut off.

170
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,300
Headsman, chop his head off this instant!

171
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,100
Yes, my lord!

172
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,620
Here comes the royal secret agent!

173
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,250
Royal secret agent?

174
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,040
But h-he was...

175
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,240
What happened?

176
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
Did you not say he was dead?

177
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,880
Are you all right?

178
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,850
It is I, Dain.

179
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,290
Dain,

180
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,000
is my head still attached?

181
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,100
Yes, it is.

182
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,570
Good, good.

183
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,870
What happened?

184
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,140
Father.

185
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,880
Lord Kim Manhui,

186
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,650
you look as if you have seen a ghost.

187
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,200
How dare he...

188
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,250
That's...

189
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,890
Honglang?

190
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,420
You!

191
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,760
How dare you appear here
as a royal agent?

192
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,530
It is the royal agent's duty to go
where there are corrupt officials.

193
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,900
I must follow the King's command
and appear in the palace,

194
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,470
If there are corrupt officials
in the palace.

195
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,010
Corrupt officials?

196
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,280
What kind of trickery are these followers
of traitors using?

197
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,050
Guards! Apprehend them!

198
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,050
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

199
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,150
His Majesty, the King!

200
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,650
Special Commander Kim Manhui,
lift your head.

201
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,020
Royal Secret Agent Seong whom you reported
to have taken his own life returned alive.

202
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,890
Report how this happened.

203
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,660
Your Majesty, I...

204
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,640
In that case, Royal Agent Seong Igyeom,
you speak.

205
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,070
I have received the suicide note
he claimed you wrote.

206
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,650
Your Majesty,
it was all Lord Kim Manhui's ruse.

207
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,750
Lord Kim Manhui

208
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,550
framed me and attempted to kill me
while I was being transported.

209
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,290
And he ordered the murder of Kim Myeongse,
the governor of Jeolla-do.

210
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,760
This is slander, Your Majesty.

211
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,070
Look at the person
who accompanied the royal agent.

212
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,170
That person is not a man but a girl.

213
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,810
That girl is the one who had
the traitor Prince Hwiyeong's okro,

214
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,610
Your Majesty.

215
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,010
Prince Hwiyeong was not a traitor.

216
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,850
How dare a prostitute interfere?

217
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,420
Are you the girl named Hong Dain?

218
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,560
Your Majesty, my name is
Lee Yeongsin.

219
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,230
I am Prince Hwiyeong's daughter.

220
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,170
How dare you lie?

221
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,510
Her words are true.

222
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,350
Your Majesty, I am ashamed to say

223
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,720
that I took her in
after Prince Hwiyeong died.

224
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,760
Are you truly Prince Hwiyeong's daughter?

225
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,200
I am, Your Majesty.

226
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:13,340
This is the secret letter
the late king presented to my father.

227
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:39,270
"Prince Hwiyeong Lee Han,
you are to raise and train an army

228
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,800
to stop the invasion from foreign vessel
and the looting of robbers."

229
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,750
Is this not the late king's royal seal?

230
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

231
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,490
After my father returned
to his hometown of Okgu,

232
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,420
he witnessed people suffering
from invasions by overseas vessels

233
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,560
and looting of robbers,
and he could not remain a bystander.

234
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,390
So in order to protect them,

235
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,470
he received permission to train an army
from the late king.

236
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,570
How could this be?

237
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,110
You said Prince Hwiyeong was advancing
to Hanyang with his army!

238
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,020
I was only concerned of your safety,
Your Majesty.

239
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,620
Stop lying.

240
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,630
You were afraid of Prince Hwiyeong
whose influence was growing.

241
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,860
And you had him killed
and reported that he took his own life.

242
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,430
Just as you did with me.

243
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,100
What is it?

244
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,300
You have walked a long way,
so you should rest a while.

245
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,440
I am fine. Let us go.

246
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,570
I must speak to you about something.

247
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,510
You men go ahead without us.

248
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,280
Yes, sir.

249
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,960
What is it?

250
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,310
Is this one of Kim Byeonggeun's ploys?

251
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,410
I had nothing to do with this.

252
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,080
Who are you?

253
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,950
It will be over soon.

254
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,990
You did not say
you were planning on killing him!

255
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,330
Go and report that he took his own life

256
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,230
because he was afraid of his plans
for treason being discovered.

257
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,710
I am not responsible for this death.

258
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,810
Who deceived him and brought him here?

259
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,180
Toss him over the cliff.

260
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,220
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

261
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,540
You are an accomplice.

262
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,410
So take what happened today to your grave.

263
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,120
You will be rewarded handsomely.

264
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,590
Is this true?

265
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,560
Your Majesty, it is all a lie!

266
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,330
How dare you attempt to
frame me with a single letter?

267
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,770
I have a witness
who can attest to all this.

268
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,040
Chunsam, bring him in!

269
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
The witness is here.

270
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,040
Who is he?

271
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,010
There is a man
who knows him better than I do.

272
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,720
Explain to His Majesty who this man is.

273
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,550
What do you mean? I do not know him.

274
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,120
Did you not order this man to kill me?

275
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,060
You!

276
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,560
You are a royal secret agent,
but everything you say is a lie.

277
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,300
I have other witnesses.

278
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,340
Summon Assistant Royal Guard Choi.

279
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,840
How can we summon a man who is missing?

280
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,450
Missing?

281
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,780
What do you mean?

282
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,950
Did you also kill him?

283
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,190
I did not.

284
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,460
Special Commander Kim, answer.

285
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,790
How did you know of the disappearance
of Assistant Royal Guard Choi?

286
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,400
What did you do with him?

287
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,240
I do not know.

288
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,910
Special Commander Kim ordered this man

289
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,410
to kill Royal Agent Park Cheolgyu,
Kang Inchung and his son Kang Jonggil,

290
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,110
Governor Kim Myeongse
and Prince Hwiyeong Lee Han.

291
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,450
Witness, speak.

292
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,430
Is that all true?

293
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,740
Yes.

294
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,280
Your Majesty, these treacherous officials
framed the loyal Prince Hwiyeong

295
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,380
and used it to gain government posts
and harmed your subjects and country

296
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,120
with illegal deeds and filthy greed
for many years,

297
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,260
so please punish them severely!

298
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,900
Following my family's lineage, I have been
establishing the royal family's authority,

299
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,070
so how dare you!

300
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,130
Enough!

301
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,210
Chief of Royal Investigation Bureau,
listen.

302
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,080
Apprehend Kim Byeongguen
and Kim Manhui this instant!

303
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

304
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,380
Your Majesty,
how could you believe his words?

305
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,850
- Your Majesty.
- You impertinent bastard!

306
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,650
You have ruined me! You have!

307
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,820
Watch your words.

308
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,060
I am Joseon's royal secret agent.

309
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,630
And you have committed high treason.

310
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,140
Your Majesty, it is not true!
It is all a lie!

311
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,270
Your Majesty!

312
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,540
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

313
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,450
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

314
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:19,247
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN

315
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,920
Good work.

316
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,920
You have made it possible for me
to renew the government.

317
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,030
Your Majesty, I only fulfilled my duty
as your royal secret agent.

318
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,870
However, I do have one wish.

319
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,100
Tell me what it is.

320
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:46,110
Due to Governor Kim Myeongse's tyranny,
the people of Jeonju lived in starvation.

321
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,680
Please order
the provincial storehouse to be opened

322
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,880
and the food distributed
to the hungry people.

323
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,820
I will do that.

324
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,560
Did you say you are Lee Yeongsin?

325
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

326
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,900
I owe you and your father a great debt.

327
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:20,140
Thank you for not giving up.

328
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,910
Your Majesty.

329
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,720
Prince Hwiyeong is no longer a traitor.

330
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,720
And your position as a member
of the royal family will be restored.

331
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,460
I cannot compensate for the years lost,

332
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,600
but I do hope
this will provide some consolation.

333
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,800
I am eternally grateful, Your Majesty.

334
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,080
Lord Seong!

335
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,520
Lord Seong.

336
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,590
Do not call me Lord Seong any longer.

337
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,330
What? Why?

338
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,430
You are a member of the royal family.

339
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,640
It may feel awkward at first,

340
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,470
but you must behave
according to your position.

341
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,170
You must call her Lady Yeongsin, no?

342
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,040
What?

343
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,640
I am not wrong, am I?

344
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,610
Do you now agree with me, Lady Yeongsin?

345
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,290
Lord Seong, I am not interested
in being a member of the royal family.

346
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,490
No one in this world is born
into the position they desire.

347
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,560
We must all live
according to the fate we were given.

348
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,870
Use your position

349
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,600
for the people suffering in poverty.

350
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,780
That is my final request to you.

351
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Yes, I will remember that.

352
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,030
Sir, that was great of you.

353
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,570
I am great.

354
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,440
I did not become a slave
because I wanted to.

355
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,310
What is the meaning of this?

356
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,510
Out of my way!

357
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,750
It is His Majesty's command to search
the prisoner Kim Byeonggeun's home!

358
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,360
Over there!

359
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Prisoners, accept the King's command.

360
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,870
Prisoner Kim Byeonggeun framed
Prince Hwiyeong Lee Han

361
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,340
of treason and falsely accused him

362
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,680
and illegally mined gold and traded it
for personal gain.

363
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,010
For these crimes, he is sentenced
to exile in Gimje.

364
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,140
As Minister of Personnel,
prisoner Jo Pilha

365
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,490
accepted bribes for personnel management,

366
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,090
accepted gold from Kim Byeonggeun,
and turned a blind eye to his crimes.

367
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,660
For these crimes, he is sentenced
to exile in Bukcheong.

368
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,800
What?

369
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,320
Prisoner Kim Manhui ordered

370
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,600
the murders of Prince Hwiyeong
and Royal Agent Park Cheolgyu

371
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,340
and he also conspired
to murder Royal Agent Seong Igyeom

372
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,070
who uncovered his crimes.

373
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,810
These crimes are grave,

374
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,480
so he is sentenced to beheading.

375
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:44,480
- Father.
- Take the prisoner Kim Manhui.

376
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,520
Beheading?

377
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,020
Investigator, free me!

378
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,790
I must speak to His Majesty!

379
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:54,120
How dare you lay your hands on his body?

380
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,730
Let go of him!

381
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,659
Let go!

382
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,130
Let go of him!

383
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,530
Manhui! Manhui! Manhui!

384
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,400
Father!

385
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,070
- Manhui! Manhui!
- Father!

386
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,170
Manhui!

387
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,070
Father!

388
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,610
- Manhui!
- Let go of me!

389
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,780
Manhui! Manhui!

390
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,830
What happened to Manhui?

391
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,300
Listen carefully!

392
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:45,110
There will come a day when you regret
not killing me!

393
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,280
I am already regretting it.

394
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,950
Thank His Majesty.

395
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,350
Had you not been royal to the late king
and teacher to His Majesty,

396
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,220
you could not have avoided beheading.

397
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,220
Go!

398
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,290
Yes, sir.

399
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,430
Come!

400
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,140
Here, here, one person at a time.
Take your time.

401
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,450
- You must be hungry.
- Come here and get some rice.

402
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,750
Here, here, take your time.

403
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,890
One person at a time.

404
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,370
Igyeom kept his word.

405
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,580
What?

406
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,260
Sir, is this truly our house?

407
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,460
Being a royal agent was worth it.

408
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,900
You got promoted to section chief
of the Ministry of Personnel

409
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,130
and received a mansion of a house!

410
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,730
Thank His Majesty.

411
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,440
Your Majesty, I am eternally grateful.

412
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,510
- Welcome, my lord.
- Welcome, my lord.

413
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,150
What?

414
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,580
My well-being is in your hands.

415
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,180
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

416
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,060
Of all the service
a woman provides for her husband,

417
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,490
not being jealous is the best conduct,

418
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,340
so do not be dissatisfied
even if he has a hundred concubines,

419
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,340
do not be angry
no matter how much he loves his concubine

420
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,280
and respect him even more.

421
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,750
Please sit straight.

422
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,650
Yes.

423
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,734
ADMONISHMENTS FOR WOMEN

424
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,060
When will you ever finish
studying "Admonishments for Women"?

425
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,870
Court Lady Kim,

426
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,540
why must I study this book?

427
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,370
You are a member of the royal family,

428
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,540
so you must conduct yourself
according to your class and dignity...

429
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,550
Lady Yeongsin!

430
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,920
Oh, yes.

431
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,490
The mission must have been draining.

432
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,060
Chief State Councilor Jang.

433
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

434
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:55,530
It concerns me that Yeongsin
is living by her lonely self.

435
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,540
Yes!

436
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,580
How about finding the perfect spouse
for Yeongsin?

437
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,280
I beg your pardon?

438
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,650
Find a groom for Yeongsin.

439
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

440
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,000
Lord Jang, this is the section chief
of the Ministry of Personnel.

441
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,410
Yes, come in.

442
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,180
Have you summoned me?

443
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,190
Sit.

444
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,530
Take a look at these men.

445
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,400
What do you think?

446
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,370
Are you appointing new officials?

447
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,350
Kang Taewon is an expert on the Odes
and the Histories and writes beautifully.

448
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,150
He is careful, meticulous,
and never makes mistakes.

449
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Jeon Yeonggyun is a martial arts expert
and is high-spirited.

450
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,130
He was a fearless boy who led the hunt
for the tiger that threatened his village.

451
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,600
Oh, did he?

452
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,780
What is it?

453
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,650
Appoint this man.

454
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,680
Kim Jeongguk needs no description.

455
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,250
On top of possessing the strengths
of the two previous men,

456
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,860
he is humble
and is respected by his peers.

457
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,060
Is he?

458
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,200
So this man would be
a perfect groom for Yeongsin.

459
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,200
Yes, he is.

460
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,570
What?

461
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,010
What did you just say?

462
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,910
His Majesty asked me to find
Yeongsin a spouse.

463
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,880
A spouse?

464
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,650
Yes.

465
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,580
So I will recommend this man to...

466
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,690
You must let me finish.

467
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,300
He is a mean drunk and enjoys gambling,

468
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,040
and most of all,
his countenance is unpleasant.

469
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,810
You said earlier
that he needs no description.

470
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,050
By any chance, are you...

471
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,880
Yes?

472
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,090
Feeling disappointed, nervous,
and concerned?

473
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,190
Do not worry.

474
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,260
I will find her a good man.

475
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Oh, by any chance, are you...

476
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,330
Yes?

477
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,870
How do you feel about Yeongsin?

478
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,840
I mean Dain.

479
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,750
I do not understand.

480
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,550
As your spouse, I mean.

481
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,580
What?

482
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,590
Never mind.

483
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,590
I meant nothing by it.

484
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,290
How could you consider her a woman?

485
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,430
Am I wrong?

486
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,270
Y-You are right.

487
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,570
That is nonsense.

488
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,770
How silly of me.

489
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,800
Let me see, his countenance...

490
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,020
Let us take a look.

491
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,690
Welcome.

492
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,900
Oh, you are a handsome couple.

493
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,630
Are you shopping for your wedding?

494
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,800
No.

495
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,740
Yes, please find something
for my bride.

496
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,480
Oh, her hair ribbon is worn.

497
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,720
How about this one?

498
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,360
Lord Ibeom, I am fine. Let us go.

499
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:54,130
Make way!
Here comes the governor!

500
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,370
Lord Ibeom, that man...

501
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,470
Sh.

502
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,380
Step aside!
Here comes the governor!

503
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,960
Step back!
Here comes the governor!

504
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,760
This is a terrible twist of fate.

505
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,590
Go home.

506
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,100
I need to see some people.

507
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,740
I heard the former governor suffered
many headaches because of robbers.

508
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,580
Is that true?

509
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,550
Yes, robbers are wreaking havoc
in the village.

510
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,320
Was it those men who stole
the governor's fortune?

511
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,520
Yes, it was.

512
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,290
What were you doing?

513
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,790
I am ashamed.

514
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,700
Why is no one reporting these robbers?

515
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,240
They give what they stole to people.

516
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,110
Because of that,
no one speaks about them.

517
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,980
Whoever they are,
how gutsy of them.

518
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,120
It will be fun to capture them.

519
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,220
Do you not agree?

520
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,660
Yes, I do agree.

521
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,730
They are all cooperating with the robbers,
are they not?

522
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,970
Now that I have come here,

523
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:43,110
I will make all efforts toward
correcting the past evils

524
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,280
and reforming customs of the people.
Do you understand?

525
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,180
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

526
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,380
Did you know the new governor
has been appointed?

527
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,920
I have made some inquiries
about him.

528
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,490
When he was the magistrate of Cheongju,

529
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,560
he forced his people to hard labor
to build a reservoir.

530
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,690
That bastard never paid them.

531
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:09,030
He charged taxes on the reservoir water
and collected money from the people.

532
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,370
What is the matter?

533
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,840
I worked for him.

534
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,750
So you must know him well.

535
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,520
What kind of man is he?

536
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,350
He is a cruel man

537
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,220
who tortures people
who committed petty crimes to death

538
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,030
and took advantage
of women of lower status.

539
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,400
There is not an ounce of humanity in him.

540
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,430
I will keep an eye
on the provincial office.

541
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:47,040
He must be plotting something.

542
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,810
Why are you out here?

543
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,720
Did you have dinner?

544
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,790
I prepared dinner for you
so go inside and eat.

545
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,160
I will go inside and start eating.

546
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,100
Lord Ibeom.

547
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,740
Lord Ibeom, what do we do now?

548
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,840
I never thought I would see him again.

549
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,810
Do not worry.

550
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,380
He does not know we are here.

551
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,050
That is...

552
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,960
My arm is about to ache. Take it.

553
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,630
Thank you.

554
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,870
It is beautiful.

555
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,540
Let us go inside. I am hungry.

556
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,340
Yes.

557
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,390
Step back!
Here comes the governor!

558
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:23,000
Step back!
Here comes the governor!

559
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,110
Step back!
Here comes the governor!

560
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,610
What is he doing?

561
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,780
Apprehend him.

562
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,880
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

563
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,020
You!

564
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,660
Did you not hear the announcement
of the governor's march?

565
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,870
He seems to be a mute.

566
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,610
A mute or not, he violated the custom.

567
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,340
Detain him.

568
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,180
- Yes, Lord Byeon.
- Yes.

569
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,180
Take him away.

570
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,150
What was that?

571
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,520
That boy!

572
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,590
Apprehend him!

573
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,930
Was it you?

574
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:25,430
Let go of my father.

575
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,830
Is that man your father?

576
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,810
He may be young,
but his crime cannot disappear.

577
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,910
You filth.

578
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:48,750
Yes, yes, since you are his father,
you should be punished instead.

579
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,620
Get him.

580
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,590
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

581
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,600
Father! Father!

582
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,470
Father! Father!

583
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,440
You!

584
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:11,940
Father! Father! Father!

585
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,750
That is enough!

586
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,220
You are Seong Ibeom!

587
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,990
Lord Ibeom!

588
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,260
She is...

589
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,230
Apprehend them all!

590
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,100
What are you waiting for?

591
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,370
Run! Run!

592
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,380
After them!

593
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,390
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

594
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,260
Are you all right?

595
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,730
This is very interesting.

596
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,830
I am very glad I came here.

597
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:09,600
The rat was hiding here.

598
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,510
Yes, so I was up against three men.

599
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,740
I punched one and the next,
pulled my shoulder back,

600
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,350
and punched the third one to the ground.

601
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:25,850
I grabbed one by his collar
and asked,

602
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,820
"Where is the royal agent?"

603
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,020
Where was he?

604
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:33,090
He was apprehended by that evil sheriff.

605
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:34,160
Oh no.

606
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,190
What happened next?

607
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,630
Who am I?

608
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,300
I can run like the wind.

609
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,030
I ran and ran as fast I could
and chased after them.

610
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:44,730
I caught up with them, and guess what?

611
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,640
He was holding the royal agent hostage.

612
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,410
Oh no.

613
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,310
Then he pushed the royal agent
down the cliff.

614
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,240
Oh, how terrible.

615
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,080
But who am I?

616
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,780
I ran like the wind and grabbed his arm.

617
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,450
Why? Wait.

618
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,490
I am about to get to the main part.

619
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,090
I was holding on to this arm
with dear life, shouting,

620
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,230
"Sir, you cannot die!

621
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,760
I cannot replace you!"

622
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,100
My shoulder was about to be dislocated,

623
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,800
and I pulled up him, shouting,
"Sir, you cannot die!"

624
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,170
And at that moment,
a sword appeared next to my neck.

625
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,100
"What is this?"

626
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,410
And I swung around, and,

627
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,370
oh, it's Lord Igyeom.

628
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,770
Oh, sir.

629
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,780
Go, go!

630
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,510
Hurry up
and go home.

631
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:29,910
Go, go.

632
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,680
Hello, sir.

633
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,490
Come with me.

634
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,350
What?

635
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,090
Where are we going?

636
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,890
To Dain,

637
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,990
I mean, we are going to Lady Yeongsin.

638
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,100
Why?

639
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,500
I have a message to deliver.

640
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,400
Come.

641
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,170
It was getting exciting.

642
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,210
Lady Yeongsin, if we get caught,
the court lady will kill me.

643
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,550
Jeomsun, everyone dies.

644
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,150
What?

645
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:14,060
I will come back soon,
so you stay here under the blanket.

646
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,930
I have told everyone
that I don't want to see anyone today.

647
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,930
My lady, my lady.

648
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,430
Oh, wait.

649
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,600
Do not get caught.

650
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,400
Or you and I are both dead.

651
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,370
What?

652
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,140
Yes, my lady.

653
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,690
Sir, it is that house.

654
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,620
Yes.

655
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,760
Lady Yeongsin, you have a guest.

656
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,270
What do I do?

657
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,400
She says to not let anyone inside!

658
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,880
He said his name is Seong Igyeom.

659
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:11,820
Whoever he may be, Seong Igyeom or not,
she does not wish to see him!

660
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,760
What's taking so long?

661
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,030
Did you say your name is Seong Igyeom?

662
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,530
I am Seong Igyeom.

663
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,070
What did Lady Yeongsin say?

664
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,400
Whoever he may be, Seong Igyeom or not,
I do not wish to see him!

665
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,640
That is what she said.

666
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,640
What? That cannot be true.

667
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,380
Please excuse me.

668
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,580
Tell her I will....

669
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,010
Wait here.

670
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,490
Sir, she must be no longer
interested in you.

671
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,460
You should have taken better care of her
during your secret mission!

672
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,760
What is this?

673
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,430
That is enough.

674
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,790
She knows we are here,
so she will come out soon.

675
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,130
Let us wait.

676
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,230
I knew this would happen.

677
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,570
I knew she will come out soon.

678
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:13,080
Lord Seong! Chunsam!

679
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,110
Is no one home?

680
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,620
Who are you?

681
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,890
I am here to see the master of this house.

682
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:29,190
Oh, the men who used to live here?

683
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,290
They have already left.

684
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,730
Left? Where did they go?

685
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,030
I would not know.

686
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,500
What is this about?

687
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,770
It is nothing.

688
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,180
How could he not tell me?

689
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,460
After all I have done for him.

690
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,330
Yes, I should forget him.

691
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,830
Men can be so ungrateful.

692
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,470
How could he not tell me?

693
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,710
Why is it so dark?

694
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:30,050
Sir, how much longer will you wait?

695
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:37,860
Fine. Let us go.

696
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,260
Come.

697
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,600
Hurry up.

698
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,940
Yes.

699
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,610
Sir, you must forget.

700
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,580
Forget what?

701
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,220
I mean Lady Yeongsin.

702
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,450
It is not like that.

703
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,150
Oh, I know you are fond her.
Am I wrong?

704
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,860
How could you be so bold?

705
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,960
I am not fond of her!

706
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,260
You are not fond of her! You are not.

707
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,660
You love her, you do.

708
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,630
How dare you!

709
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,540
When I get my hands on you...

710
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,790
I hear you are now a section chief
of the Ministry of Personnel.

711
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,430
Congratulations to you.

712
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:51,230
But what brings you here?

713
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,910
I had business to do near here.

714
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,580
Where have you been?

715
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,880
There was someone I wished to see,
so I went to see him.

716
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,390
You must have made up your mind.

717
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,660
So, who is he?

718
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:30,040
He has a warm heart.

719
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,150
He is courageous
and has a strong sense of responsibility.

720
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,880
He can be cold sometimes,

721
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,490
but he always puts others before him.

722
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:52,000
It was a feeling I had never felt before
from another person.

723
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,800
Was there such man among them?

724
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:58,000
Is it Kang Taewon?

725
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,040
No.

726
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,670
Jeon Yeonggyun?

727
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,840
No.

728
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,410
Oh, is it Kim Jeongguk?

729
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,680
I said no!

730
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:19,560
Regardless, do not be mistaken.

731
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,290
All men hide a sly fox inside them.

732
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,000
No one knows
when that sly fox may come out,

733
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,500
so you best be cautious.

734
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,110
Do you know whom I was describing?

735
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,240
I do not care. Good luck with you.

736
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,280
It is you!

737
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,120
Me?

738
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:02,630
Yes, you.

739
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:22,120
The man you were describing was me?

740
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,390
That is correct.

741
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,600
Yes, I am like that.

742
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,270
You are an excellent judge of character.

743
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,950
By the way, do you have one too?

744
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:50,510
What?

745
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:53,520
What do you mean?

746
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:56,220
A sly fox.

747
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:00,020
You said all men hide it inside them.

748
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:04,090
And you are a man.

749
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:09,030
Oh, that?

750
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,540
I do have it.

751
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:18,480
So would you be a fox hunter in my heart?

752
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,180
Fox hunter?

753
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,580
Is there something else I can be?

754
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,190
I am sincere.

755
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,690
Then, how about this?

756
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,300
We still have an unfinished business
that is quite important.

757
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,540
I wanted to tell you before completing
the mission, but there was no chance.

758
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:53,840
Have you forgotten already?

759
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,950
The bet you and I made.

760
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,020
You promised to do what I ask.

761
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,550
Oh, the bet we made at the gambling house?

762
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,900
Yes, tell me what you want.

763
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,570
What I want...

764
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,850
Is for us to remain together
even after the mission.

765
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:40,420
Is it too much to ask?

766
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:48,230
Why did you wait to tell me that?

767
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:56,870
That was my intention from the start.

768
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,435
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

769
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,150
<i>Have you not heard anything
from your brother?</i>

770
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,280
<i>I am hoping no news is good news.</i>

771
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,550
<i>Was he there as well?</i>

772
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:16,920
<i>They were together.</i>

773
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,760
<i>Apprehend them,
even if you have to kill them.</i>

774
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,390
<i>Deliver this message.
All the girls will be beheaded.</i>

775
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,790
<i>There is only one thing to do.</i>

776
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,160
<i>What is it?</i>

777
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,370
<i>"He is tyrannizing under the pretext
of capturing robbers."</i>

778
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:30,100
<i>I will assassinate the governor.</i>

779
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,140
<i>The man in the office is changing,
but the tyranny is getting worse.</i>

780
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,310
<i>We must change the world
in order to survive.</i>

781
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,010
<i>You want to go on another secret mission?</i>

782
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,240
<i>Will you not regret it?</i>

783
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,410
<i>I'll probably regret it.</i>

784
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:41,410
<i>I have learned
there are paths one must take</i>

785
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:43,350
<i>despite knowing there will be regrets.</i>
