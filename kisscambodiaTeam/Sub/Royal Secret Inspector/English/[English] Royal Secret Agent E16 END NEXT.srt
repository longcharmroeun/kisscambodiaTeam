1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,250
Where are you going?

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,850
{\an8}FINAL EPISODE

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,760
Step aside.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,330
Do you know who he is?

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,000
I do, Royal Agent Seong.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,830
Are you here to summon the station guards?

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,170
Apprehend the royal secret agent?

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,870
Did we not come here
to apprehend the robbers?

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,609
We only need to follow the orders.

10
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,580
Do you dare to stop a royal agent
from appearing?

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,150
Do you not know that it's a crime
against the government to stop one?

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,890
Stop?

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,689
I only came to show hospitality
to the royal agent.

14
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,890
You only need to appear to punish
corrupt officials, am I wrong?

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,200
There are no corrupt officials here.

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,500
You are beyond brazen.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,570
Using robbers as an excuse,
you oppressed innocent people,

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,110
and moreover,
you turned commoners into slaves.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,210
As the governor,
it is my duty to apprehend robbers

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,110
using any means possible.

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,120
And with the matter of slaves,

22
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,750
the commoners volunteered
to become slaves,

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,550
so who am I to stop them?

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,620
Then you have no reason to stop me
from appearing.

25
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,960
Step aside this instant.

26
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:25,629
Come with us to the provincial office.

27
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:29,330
I have a rather interesting story
to tell you.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,710
It is about two brothers
who fell apart because of a girl.

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,569
Are you not interested in the details?

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,150
If this is a ruse to stop me...

31
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,580
If you feel suspicious,
you can ask the person involved.

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,020
Her name is Kang Sunae.

33
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,660
Apprehend them!

34
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:56,790
Stop!

35
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,370
Anyone who dares to stop me
will face grave punishment!

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,470
Is this insubordination?

37
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,470
He is a robber impersonating
a royal agent!

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,880
There is no need for fear.
Apprehend him!

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,810
Apprehend him!

40
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,120
Sir, what do we do?

41
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,060
The station is near,
so you bring the station guards.

42
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,590
What about you?

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,790
I will do my best to buy time.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,860
Run like how you always run from me.

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,170
Yes, sir.

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,680
Your Majesty!

47
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,620
Fooled you.

48
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,850
Out of my way!

49
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,490
Get him!

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,930
Get him!

51
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,360
Here comes the royal secret...

52
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,890
Chunsam!

53
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,970
Stop.

54
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,740
Move, and he dies.

55
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,390
What good is a soldier
who cannot even defend himself?

56
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,790
Just kill him.

57
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,860
Lord Byeon!

58
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,760
Get him!

59
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,900
Stop!

60
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,240
Or he dies.

61
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,890
I am sorry, sir.

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,830
Take them to the provincial office!

63
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,970
Take them.

64
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,860
Oh, it is a fine day.

65
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,170
Oh, it is a clear, beautiful day.

66
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,340
Hey, what are you doing?

67
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,940
Go to the back of the line.

68
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,380
Let me go in front of you.

69
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,840
Can't you see the people behind me?

70
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,410
Where? Where?

71
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,850
Get lost before I get mad.

72
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,380
Oh, for a wild boar, you are petty.

73
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,320
Wild boar?

74
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,990
- Wild boar?
- Oh, geez!

75
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,160
You idiot!

76
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,420
Let go of him!

77
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,960
What are you doing?

78
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,230
Wait here.

79
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,660
You idiot!

80
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,900
What are you waiting for? Take them away!

81
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,070
Look here!

82
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,309
The dead is waiting.

83
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:04,770
How much longer must we wait?

84
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,280
Let go of me!

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,380
What is that?

86
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,050
Can't you tell?

87
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,420
A person died in there,
so we are bringing a coffin.

88
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,320
Oh, I am dying!

89
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,650
Help me!

90
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,420
Go in.

91
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,059
I'm dying!

92
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,860
Help me!

93
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,160
Let them in!

94
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,030
That is enough.

95
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,200
Let go of me! Let go!

96
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Get him off of me!

97
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,270
You!

98
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,600
Let go of me!

99
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,970
Help me!

100
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,710
Help me, please!

101
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,010
- Let go of me!
- Let go, you! Help!

102
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,310
Do come again.

103
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,350
Sure.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,060
Where are you going?

105
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,860
It is not your concern.

106
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,730
Sit down.

107
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,830
Do you expect me to relieve myself
where I was eating?

108
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,410
Please hurry.

109
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,580
I will not.

110
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,309
Geez.

111
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,150
How could he be so relaxed?

112
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,550
It is tonight.

113
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,190
Will you join us or not?

114
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,090
Who here does not owe Jeon Gyesu?

115
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,690
- Jeon Gyesu?
- We must go and do our part.

116
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,560
I agree with you.

117
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,970
Let us hurry.

118
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,380
Oh, I apologize.

119
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,420
Come.

120
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,180
"I plan to punish the governor,

121
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,980
so those who wish to join my cause

122
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,950
shall gather on the last day
of this month."

123
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,290
It is tonight.

124
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,420
We must inform the royal agent.

125
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,430
If this letter is real,

126
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,460
it is not something we can stop.

127
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,310
I have seen countless bad officials
while on secret missions.

128
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,680
Their crimes varied quite much,
but every one of them said the same thing.

129
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,880
"I am not responsible.
I only did what I was told."

130
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,920
Can you truly call them loyal?

131
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,430
Please think about whom His Majesty needs
in a moment like this.

132
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,030
Do you wish to help the royal agent?

133
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,300
Yes.

134
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,340
Helping the royal agent
is helping His Majesty.

135
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,480
You are fearless.

136
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,890
Sometimes you must do what your heart says
in order to leave no regrets.

137
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Come.

138
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,060
Where?

139
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,530
To the royal agent.

140
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,820
Chunsam.

141
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
Where is Sunae?

142
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,330
How impatient of you.

143
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,660
You can see her after I finish my story.

144
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,100
That jerk.

145
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,570
I would like our relationship
to be amicable.

146
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,140
We have history, do we not?

147
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,040
Stop the ambiguity.

148
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,280
What do you want?

149
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,150
I only need you to write a few words

150
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,220
saying everything here
is running smoothly and peacefully.

151
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,460
What would that get me in return?

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,100
I will not report

153
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,240
that you have been protecting
the robbers.

154
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,770
When did I begin protecting you?

155
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,410
What?

156
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,950
The only robbers I have seen here
are you and your men

157
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,390
who beat innocent people
and steal their status and wealth.

158
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,760
So you can talk.

159
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,660
But once you see this,
you might change your mind.

160
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,860
Bring her!

161
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,970
Lady Sunae.

162
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,770
Sunae.

163
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,350
Sunae!

164
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,760
You! What did you do?

165
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,200
I only delivered the punishment
the criminal deserved.

166
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,030
Criminal?

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,900
Whom do you think
should tell him the truth?

168
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,670
Lord Igyeom.

169
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,210
Looking at you this way
brings back memories.

170
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,650
I should have executed you back then.

171
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,550
Execute?

172
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,920
What do you mean?

173
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,520
Did you not know?

174
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,290
She is a Catholic.

175
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,730
Catholic?

176
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,270
I was generous enough to take her in,

177
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,640
but she refused to sleep with me,
so I had no reason to keep her alive.

178
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,210
Tell me.

179
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,820
Do you still think your Catholic god
will save your life?

180
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,520
Just kill me.

181
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,200
You have not changed.

182
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,430
You! Take your hand off her!

183
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,570
You should be angry
at your younger brother and not me.

184
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:24,350
Because he took her and fled,
I could not execute the criminal.

185
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,120
Ibeom, she is my woman.

186
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,720
Look after her for me until I return.

187
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,760
I will. Do not worry.

188
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,900
Because of the promise he made with me...

189
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,630
Lord Igyeom.

190
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,700
Now you see?

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,910
If I open my mouth,

192
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,850
you will become a traitor who protected
a robber and a Catholic.

193
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,220
So take your time
and consider my offer.

194
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,160
Lock them up!

195
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,990
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

196
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,000
Your stipend comes from the tax money
collected from the people.

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,940
Are you not ashamed
of the regimentals you are wearing?

198
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,010
Take them!

199
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,510
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

200
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,840
Let go of me!

201
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,350
Bring me my horse.
I must visit someone.

202
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,280
Yes, Lord Byeon.

203
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,920
Lord Byeon, I apologize.

204
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,120
You are pathetic.
Get out of my sight.

205
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,300
Tsk, tsk.

206
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,240
You should have done a better job.

207
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,140
You should be ashamed.

208
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,870
You fool.

209
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,250
Are you all right?

210
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,620
Yes.

211
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,450
Why did you not tell me?

212
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,290
I am sorry.

213
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,690
Was it for my sake?

214
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,490
Were you afraid for my safety?

215
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,940
I did not intend to deceive you.

216
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,570
For you...

217
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,010
Did you think I would abandon you
for my success?

218
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,250
After you two disappeared,

219
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,480
everything in my life became meaningless.

220
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,220
You must abandon me.

221
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,460
I cannot be a burden for you any longer.

222
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,760
We must escape from here.

223
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,470
Sir, I have an idea.

224
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:03,810
I will pretend to have a seizure
as if I'm diabetic.

225
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,310
I can make it realistic.

226
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,610
That will not work.

227
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,910
How would you know without trying?

228
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,180
Like so.

229
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,350
I just know.

230
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,590
Chunsam.

231
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,220
Yes?

232
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,590
Do you have the compass
Lady Yeongsin gave you?

233
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,490
Compass?

234
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,830
Yes, I have it inside my pocket.

235
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,830
Why do you ask?

236
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,040
What? Why? What now?

237
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,610
No, not this.

238
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,080
Make it sound good.

239
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,249
I am relying on you.

240
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:47,350
But it is mine.

241
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,320
Hey, over here.

242
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,150
What is it?

243
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,650
What could this be?

244
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,960
This is a limited edition compass

245
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,700
made by the best compass craftsman
in Hanyang using the rare wood

246
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,530
that is offered as tribute
to the royal family.

247
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,470
There are only three of these in Joseon,
and I have one right here.

248
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,740
Did you steal it?

249
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,010
Did I steal it? How could you say that?

250
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,210
Please take this,
and bring us a bowl of water.

251
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,080
You dropped it.

252
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,630
Open the door.

253
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,230
What do you need?

254
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,330
I was ordered to send the prisoners
to the slave market.

255
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,630
Yes, sir.

256
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,170
Wait, wait.

257
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,240
Get it out.

258
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,750
Let us go.

259
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,420
What happened?

260
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,590
Tie them up, and bring them out!

261
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,490
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

262
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,660
Lord Kim, I have apprehended
the royal secret agent.

263
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,430
Did you?

264
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,400
What happened to the robber
named Seong Ibeom?

265
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,310
Many people have received rice from them.

266
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,810
So it is not easy to find them.

267
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,720
But now that we have his girl
and his older brother,

268
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,720
with a little rumor,
I believe he will show himself.

269
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,990
It is too early to celebrate.

270
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,700
Don't be fooled
by the royal agent's pretty face.

271
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,970
This letter says that the royal agent
has been colluding with the robbers.

272
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,280
Send it to Hanyang to prepare
for the unexpected.

273
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,050
You are very thorough.

274
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,650
Seong Igyeom.

275
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,120
I must see him with my own eyes.

276
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,690
Let's go.

277
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,720
Yes, Lord.

278
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,360
Where are you taking us?

279
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,040
What are you doing?

280
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,680
I will side with the royal agent.

281
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,820
Rather than dying like a beast
under the governor,

282
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,420
I choose to die with honor, however brief,
by the royal agent's side.

283
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,920
I will not force this on you.

284
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,320
It is your choice.

285
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,900
Thank you.

286
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,220
Why are you helping us?

287
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,560
You asked if we were not ashamed
of the regimentals we are wearing.

288
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,200
I do not possess the power
to stand against injustice, but you do.

289
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,510
And most of all,
the governor annoys me.

290
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,680
Good decision.

291
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,450
Lord Igyeom,

292
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,650
prepare to make your appearance.

293
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,720
You should get to safety.

294
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,350
Do not worry about me.

295
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,530
There is a temple nearby
called Boeunsa.

296
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,190
You should go there.

297
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,330
I will take you.

298
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,970
Thank you.

299
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,230
Go, Lord Igyeom.

300
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,800
Yes.

301
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Come.

302
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Yes, sir.

303
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,440
Thank you.

304
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,590
That man is...

305
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,130
He should be in exile,
so what is he doing here?

306
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,040
Something must have gone wrong
with the royal agent's plan.

307
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,110
Where are you going?

308
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,010
I must find Lord Igyeom.

309
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,220
Yes.

310
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,060
Boss, what if not a lot of people show up?

311
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,760
We will learn soon enough.

312
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:42,540
Did you pass this out?

313
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,310
We did.

314
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,010
This is the place!

315
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,370
We are here to see the prisoners.
Open the door.

316
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,010
What? The prisoners were sent
to the slave market.

317
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,850
What? What do you mean?

318
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,650
I was told you gave the order.

319
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,620
Who gave such an order?

320
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,720
Captain told us.

321
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,490
The horse requisition tablet!

322
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,380
What is it?

323
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,480
Lord Kim, the royal agent
and his horse requisition tablet are gone.

324
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,690
This is why I told you to take caution!

325
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,990
Gather your soldiers.

326
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,390
The royal agent will soon arrive.

327
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,310
Countless government officials have been
stealing rice from us

328
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,680
and have been threatening our lives.

329
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,510
We are supposed to be
the root of the country.

330
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,650
How much longer
must we just watch those who threaten us?

331
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:15,120
Now we must attack the provincial office,
and take down the corrupt officials.

332
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,230
Let us show once and for all
whom they must fear!

333
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,440
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

334
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,430
There are no guards.

335
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,640
Go and free those in prison.

336
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,970
Go and find the guards and subdue them.

337
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,210
Let us go and apprehend Byeon Haksu.

338
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,750
Yes.

339
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,410
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

340
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,530
Oh, look who it is!

341
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,160
You are Seong Ibeom!

342
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,740
This provincial office
belongs to the people!

343
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,370
According to whom?

344
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,410
Men!

345
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,240
Are you Seong Igyeom's younger brother?

346
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,510
I set this trap for the older brother,
but the younger brother has been caught.

347
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:07,820
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN

348
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,310
Is everyone here?

349
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,910
We will now attack the provincial office.

350
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,710
I will apprehend the governor
and interrogate him for further crimes.

351
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,620
The provincial guards may resist,
so you must be prepared.

352
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,490
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

353
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,820
Lord Igyeom!

354
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,300
What...

355
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,260
Lady Yeongsin.

356
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,530
What are you doing here?

357
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,600
That is what I would like to ask you.

358
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,640
Was there a problem with your plan?

359
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,710
Something did happen.

360
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,810
But, Assistant Royal Guard Choi,

361
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,210
you were to take Lady Yeongsin to Hanyang.

362
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,880
Why did you return?

363
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,550
We saw the governor and Kim Byeonggeun
enter the provincial office.

364
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,250
Kim Byeonggeun?

365
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,920
He was exiled, so why is he here?

366
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,690
They must be plotting something.

367
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,930
This is good.

368
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,960
I was about to take the station guards
to the provincial office.

369
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,930
Lord Igyeom, I found this.

370
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,870
What is this?

371
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,100
It says there will be a revolt.

372
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,370
If men gathered last night
after reading this,

373
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,480
the provincial office
must have been attacked already.

374
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,550
Revolt? As if apprehending
corrupt officials isn't hard enough?

375
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,020
Why do you think the revolt happened?

376
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,420
People who lost
their possessions and status

377
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,160
and are angry at the governor's tyranny
must have participated.

378
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,200
Their rage probably reached its limit
from losing their loved ones.

379
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,300
Lord Igyeom, before you head
to the provincial office,

380
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
stop by the slave market first.

381
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,910
You must rescue the people there.

382
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,140
Yes. Let us hurry.

383
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,320
Lord Jang, what brings you here?

384
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,120
The governor ordered me
to get rid of all the slaves.

385
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,630
Kill them all, and leave no trace.

386
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,030
Bring them out!

387
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,030
What are you waiting for?

388
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,000
Come out!

389
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,450
Kill them all.

390
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,780
Stop!

391
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,210
Here comes the royal secret agent!

392
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,460
Apprehend everyone!

393
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,050
I told you I was no ordinary servant!

394
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,690
I only did what I was told.

395
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,960
That is your crime.

396
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,530
Kneel in front of them and not me.

397
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,220
Lord Igyeom, leave this place to us,

398
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,690
and head for the provincial office.

399
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,750
I will.

400
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,960
I will leave the station guards,

401
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,190
so sort things out
and come to the provincial office.

402
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,060
Yes, Lord Igyeom.

403
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,690
Chunsam, come.

404
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,490
Yes, sir.

405
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,560
You men come with me!

406
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,240
Step aside!

407
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,610
Lord Seong!

408
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,510
Stop.

409
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,810
I was waiting for you.

410
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,850
I will come with you.

411
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,850
Good. Come.

412
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,240
Sir, what is it?

413
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,470
There are no guards at the gate.

414
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,580
What?

415
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,250
You are right. This is strange.

416
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,330
Search inside!

417
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,230
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

418
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:53,879
Sir, over there.

419
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Sir.

420
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,620
- Ibeom.
- Lord Ibeom!

421
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,450
Ibeom.

422
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,600
What happened?

423
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:15,970
Igyeom.

424
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,000
Untie them, and take them to the doctor's.

425
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,870
Yes, sir.

426
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,010
Stop right there!

427
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,590
They have revolted, so they are criminals.

428
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,720
Anyone who lays a hand on them

429
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,890
shall be considered one of them
no matter who they are!

430
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,570
You have finally revealed
your true colors.

431
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,000
Guards! Apprehend the station guards!

432
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,560
As you said,

433
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,030
the royal agent was colluding
with the robbers.

434
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,070
Yes, that is how it looks.

435
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,600
What?

436
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,870
Station guards, listen!

437
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:34,080
As you can see, the royal secret agent
has forgotten his duty

438
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,750
and colluded with the robbers!

439
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,180
The royal agent is working
with the robbers!

440
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,420
So he must be removed from his position!

441
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,460
Anyone who dares to follow
the royal agent's words

442
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,660
will be punished for the same crime.

443
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,270
Everything he said is a lie!

444
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,840
What right do you have
to punish the royal agent?

445
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,120
I could not punish a royal agent,
but I could punish a criminal.

446
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,790
You must know very well
which of us the real criminal is.

447
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,990
Are you saying that criminal
is not your younger brother?

448
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,830
His Majesty has been informed,

449
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,130
so when you return to Hanyang,
you will be interrogated.

450
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:35,600
You are a criminal in exile,
so how dare you mention His Majesty?

451
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,540
You!

452
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:41,240
Lord Kim has assisted me in apprehending
those who conspired to revolt,

453
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,350
so His Majesty will give him credit.

454
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Fine.

455
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,430
He will surely be executed,
so if you are truly innocent,

456
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,830
cut his head off,
and prove to us of your innocence.

457
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,570
Then everyone here will believe you.

458
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,640
If you cannot do so,
you would be admitting your own guilt.

459
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
How about it?

460
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,090
Can you cut his head off?

461
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,920
Igyeom,

462
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,060
kill me.

463
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,260
How could I ever kill you?

464
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,800
I would rather die by your hand...

465
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,140
Than anyone else's hand.

466
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,340
Only then will this be over.

467
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,000
Sir.

468
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,570
Sir, sir.

469
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,230
You and I...

470
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,310
Have been handed the most brutal fate.

471
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,410
Igyeom.

472
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,110
I was correct.

473
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,480
Guards! Apprehend the criminals!

474
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,080
Step aside!

475
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,090
What is happening?

476
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,490
They are...

477
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,030
Lady Yeongsin.

478
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,960
These men established
the notorious slave market,

479
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,230
turned innocent commoners into slaves,

480
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,040
and sold them illegally.

481
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,640
Governor Byeon Haksu

482
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,480
knows about this better than anyone,

483
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,710
since he is the man who turned
commoners into slaves.

484
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,320
That is ridiculous.

485
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,020
What kind of trickery is this?

486
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:47,360
There are dozens of forged self sales
documents and witness accounts.

487
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,260
Do you still refuse to admit it?

488
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,560
Answer me.

489
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,870
Who provides slaves to you?

490
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:03,370
All the slaves came from this place.

491
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,210
Apprehend them all,
and lock them up in prison!

492
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,350
Kill all those who resist!

493
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,380
Stop!

494
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,250
You must protect the people.

495
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,990
So how can you kill them
after listening to their pain?

496
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,900
What is this?

497
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,760
What are you waiting for?

498
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,100
Apprehend them!

499
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,640
This is enough!

500
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,810
Are you not ashamed?

501
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,210
How much longer will you blame yourselves,
following unjust orders?

502
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,850
We have seen their evil deeds,
and we know what happened.

503
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:53,020
What makes us
any different from those scoundrels?

504
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,730
That man is a deserter!

505
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,190
He will be beheaded!

506
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,360
Apprehend them this instant!

507
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,370
Anyone who wishes to work for the people
and not the corrupt officials,

508
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,670
put down the weapons and join us!

509
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,670
Anyone who puts down their weapon
will be punished!

510
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,210
I will follow the royal agent's order.

511
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,520
How dare you!

512
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,200
How dare you!

513
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,870
Do you wish to die?

514
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,340
What is happening?

515
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,220
Stop acting like fools,

516
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,150
and return to Hanyang
to receive punishment for your crimes.

517
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,290
Station guards, apprehend these men!

518
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,260
What?

519
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,960
No!

520
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,260
No, let go of me!

521
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,300
Let go of me!

522
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,730
- Let go!
- Let go!

523
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:11,700
Let go of me!

524
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,710
This is what happens to the treacherous.

525
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,580
Let go of me, let go.

526
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,010
Ibeom.

527
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:25,780
Igyeom.

528
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,980
Let go!

529
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,680
You! You!

530
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:38,890
Lord Ibeom!

531
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,800
No!

532
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,400
You!

533
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,980
Ibeom.

534
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,280
Igyeom.

535
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,320
I am sorry.

536
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,410
Ibeom.

537
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,550
Ibeom!

538
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,560
- Boss!
- Boss!

539
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,540
Take his body.

540
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,310
Sunae is at Boeunsa.

541
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,380
Let him rest there.

542
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,550
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

543
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,740
Take the criminals away!

544
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,910
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

545
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,980
Seong Igyeom, you!

546
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,320
How dare you! Seong Igyeom!

547
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,890
Let go of me!

548
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,050
Seong Igyeom!

549
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,620
How dare you!

550
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,220
No!

551
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,190
Let go of me!

552
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,030
Let go!

553
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,370
Everyone listen!

554
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,470
The man who led the revolt has died,

555
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,940
so I will not punish
those who participated.

556
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,540
Therefore everyone who was imprisoned
will be pardoned,

557
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,350
and those who were forced into slavery
will be reinstated.

558
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,590
And...

559
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,530
Those two officials and who follow them
will receive just punishment!

560
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,140
Lord Igyeom.

561
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,050
Let us return to Hanyang.

562
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,850
I will catch up so go ahead.

563
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,760
Yes, Lord Igyeom.

564
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,700
Come.

565
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,430
Let's go.

566
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:44,940
Lord Igyeom.

567
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,440
Sunae.

568
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,460
Ibeom.

569
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,730
Igyeom.

570
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,240
You are dead.

571
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,670
That is how you and I can both survive.

572
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,410
Sunae is waiting for you.

573
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,810
Survive, and go to her.

574
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,160
Thank you.

575
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,300
Look after yourself.

576
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,380
There was a world we have dreamed of.

577
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,280
I will strive to make that happen.

578
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,890
You should do your part as well.

579
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:10,860
Then one day, we might meet again.

580
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,600
Yes, Igyeom.

581
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,470
Royal Secret Agent Seong Igyeom

582
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,000
has revealed Governor Byeon Haksu's
greed and tyranny

583
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,400
and the related crimes
of the traitor Kim Byeonggeun.

584
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,080
Your accomplishment is great,

585
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,780
however, I have questions I must ask.

586
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,020
According to Byeon Haksu's appeal,

587
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,220
the man who attempted to kill him
was your younger brother.

588
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,490
Is that true?

589
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,000
Yes, he is my half-brother.

590
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,240
Does that mean you admit
you are the man behind the revolt?

591
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,440
People revolted because of
Governor Byeon Haksu's tyranny.

592
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,780
The governor stole
people's status and possessions.

593
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,880
Their lives were threatened,
so they had no choice but to fight.

594
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:48,190
The royal secret agent only stopped
a bigger revolt from taking place.

595
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,870
Your Majesty, the reason why they revolted

596
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:01,140
was because they wished
their voices to be heard.

597
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:07,480
Unless the world they dream of comes,

598
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,580
the revolt will not cease
and continue to spread like bushfire.

599
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,660
What is the world they dream of?

600
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,560
It is the world
where people live with dignity.

601
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:33,100
Your Majesty,
please answer to their voices.

602
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,850
The man who led the revolt
in Jeonju has died,

603
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,080
and the royal agent consoled the people,
appeasing the uproar.

604
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:54,120
Therefore no one who was involved
in the Jeonju revolt will be punished,

605
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:01,360
and from this moment on,
no one shall mention it.

606
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,240
Jeolla Governor Byeon Haksu will be exiled
in a faraway island,

607
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,140
and his family will be relocated
to the border area.

608
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,550
Traitor Kim Byeonggeun
is sentenced to execution.

609
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,020
What did you wish for?

610
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:03,660
I prayed that no more people in this world
suffer from injustice.

611
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,760
How about you?

612
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,400
I made a similar wish.

613
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:14,440
I prayed for a world
where a royal secret agent is not needed.

614
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,710
We made the same wish.

615
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,780
Since my wish will come true
thanks to your wish,

616
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:25,820
I should make a different wish.

617
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,250
What will that be?

618
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:36,690
I will pray for a life with you
and for things to be as good as now.

619
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,930
How do you like that wish?

620
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,370
I feel like it will come true.

621
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,580
Lord Igyeom, it is snowing.

622
00:54:33,848 --> 00:54:35,690
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

623
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,230
Chief State Councilor Jang,
I was about to pay you a visit.

624
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,230
You must come with me.

625
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,310
I summoned you
because of the recent appeals.

626
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:13,720
"Royal Secret Agent Seong Igyeom
demanded 100 silver coins as a bribe..."

627
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,360
What does this mean?

628
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,530
I demanded a bribe?

629
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,370
I have not been outside Hanyang recently.

630
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,600
I know.

631
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,770
I assume due to the work
you did in the countryside,

632
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,340
there are men
who are taking advantage of your fame.

633
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,210
Pardon me?

634
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:38,780
They are deceiving the people,
impersonating you.

635
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,790
Those trashy insects!

636
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,160
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

637
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:00,070
These things are occurring
because you are outstanding.

638
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:06,970
You have demanded bribes
in several places.

639
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,510
The sheriffs must have
squeezed their people dry

640
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:13,420
to get the amount you demanded.

641
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,750
My name cannot be...

642
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,150
No.

643
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,860
The honor of the royal secret agent
cannot be tarnished.

644
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:27,060
Send a real royal secret agent,
and resolve this issue.

645
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,670
You and I agree.

646
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,000
However...

647
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:39,510
Who could apprehend the man
who is impersonating Seong Igyeom?

648
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,510
You are correct.

649
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,650
It will not be easy to find the right man.

650
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:48,320
Yes! No one is as good as you.

651
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,520
But you have suffered enough,
so I cannot ask you to go again.

652
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,700
What am I to do?

653
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,320
Lord Igyeom,

654
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,890
how was it with Chief Royal Council Jang?

655
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,160
Lady Yeongsin,

656
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,360
I am sorry.

657
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,760
Pardon me? You are sorry?

658
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,240
No, no.

659
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,140
No, it cannot be.

660
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,480
You cannot say you are going
on a secret mission again.

661
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,580
No, no.

662
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:50,080
I am.

663
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,010
What?

664
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:55,520
Aren't there other men in the government?

665
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,420
Why must you go again?

666
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,960
I will go and speak to His Majesty and...

667
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,800
Men who are impersonating
a royal secret agent are torturing people,

668
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:10,930
so how could I just do nothing?

669
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,040
Are you asking me
to wait for you until you return?

670
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,410
Lady Yeongsin.

671
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,150
Fine. Where are you going this time?

672
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,110
Are you going to some island?

673
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,480
I'm going to Gyeongsang-do.

674
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,450
Gyeongsang-do?

675
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,320
Yes.

676
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,490
You know how I am, do you not?

677
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,960
I am not good at waiting.

678
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:40,460
Lady Yeongsin.

679
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,130
What are you waiting for?

680
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:47,340
Go and prepare,
and have a nice long journey by yourself.

681
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,070
L-Lady...

682
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:20,500
Sir, the air is cold.

683
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,640
What if you catch a cold?

684
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,640
Do go inside.

685
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,740
The moon is very bright.

686
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,450
What?

687
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,680
I agree.

688
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,120
Women are so difficult to understand.

689
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,590
Lady Yeongsin...

690
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,760
She even followed you
on your secret mission.

691
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,810
Why would she abandon you now

692
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:48,160
when all there is left to do is
to live in happiness?

693
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:49,800
Chunsam,

694
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,440
I am to go on a secret mission.

695
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:54,800
What?

696
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,380
Lady Yeongsin is a wise woman.

697
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:07,980
Take it.

698
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:10,950
What is that?

699
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:27,370
What is this?

700
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,770
It is a document to free you.

701
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,270
What?

702
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,480
Chunsam,

703
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,110
you are no longer a slave.

704
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,390
Sir.

705
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,190
You told me once

706
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,560
that you wish to escape
from this dreadful life as a slave

707
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,960
and live a new life.

708
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,000
You are free now.

709
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:02,200
So live the life you've always wanted.

710
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,080
I am forever indebted to you,
even after I die.

711
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,430
- Chunsam.
- Good luck on your secret mission.

712
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,670
I will leave to realize my dream now.

713
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,270
Please look after yourself.

714
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:38,940
Chunsam.

715
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:45,010
Let me have a hug.

716
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,920
Sir.

717
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,220
Sir!

718
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,160
By the way,

719
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:01,000
you said you were forever indebted to me.

720
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,570
How do you plan on repaying me?

721
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,070
- My secret mission...
- What?

722
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:10,910
I will think about it later.

723
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,910
I must go and realize my dream.

724
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,010
I am Hong Dain...

725
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:50,750
The scoundrel?

726
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,550
Sir, hurry up.

727
01:03:05,337 --> 01:03:06,949
OPEN WHEN YOU GET TO NAMDAEMUN

728
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,980
You come empty handed,
you leave empty handed.

729
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:20,880
Being alone is not so bad.

730
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,920
It is I,

731
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,320
Park Chunsam.

732
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,560
Chunsam?

733
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,130
Is that my clothing?

734
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,670
Yes, it is.

735
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:46,040
But clothing is not important.

736
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,700
I am no longer a slave,
so I must dress accordingly.

737
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:51,970
Why did you come?

738
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:53,780
I told you to go and live your life.

739
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,150
I was going to realize my dream, but...

740
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,150
Over there.

741
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:13,460
Lady Yeongsin,
why are you dressed like that?

742
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,800
Have I not told you?

743
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,170
That I am not good at waiting.

744
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,710
So I've decided to go with you.

745
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,280
And who would look after you
if not I?

746
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:31,980
Yes, you are the only one.

747
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,120
Don't forget about me.

748
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:37,150
But Lord Igyeom,

749
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:39,960
this is the last time,
and I really mean it.

750
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,120
Do you understand?

751
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,960
I do.

752
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,100
Let us go and apprehend
all corrupt officials.

753
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,830
Yes, let us go.

754
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,980
What is the mission?

755
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,950
There are men who are impersonating me.

756
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:05,950
What?

757
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:08,250
Of all people,
why would they impersonate you?

758
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,790
How strange.

759
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,320
What could we do?

760
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,320
Corrupt officials tremble in fear
when they hear his name.

761
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,460
Tremble?

762
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,560
That cannot be.

763
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,960
Why did you bring this fool?

764
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,100
I do not know.

765
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,470
Wait, I am not a slave anymore,

766
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:25,840
so do not call me fool.

767
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,770
You fool!

768
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,570
Again?

769
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:29,140
Lord Igyeom, calm yourself.

770
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,810
Three is better than one, is it not?

771
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:34,110
Just the two of us might have been better.

772
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:35,510
Then you two be
the royal agent's entourage.

773
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,080
I will leave.

774
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:37,980
Leave, leave!

775
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,220
You think I'm joking? I am leaving!

776
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:40,980
I am!

777
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:41,920
Hey!

778
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,750
You fool!

779
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,020
So childish!

780
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,190
Wait for me!

781
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,290
I am not going to do this!
It is no fun!

782
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,560
Get him!

783
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,090
You got me again!

784
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,300
Oh, you two!
