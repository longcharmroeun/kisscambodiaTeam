EPISODE 14

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,400
What I want...

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,180
Is for us to remain together
even after the mission.

4
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,520
Is it too much to ask?

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,500
Why did you wait to tell me that?

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,140
That was my intention from the start.

7
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,220
Lord Seong, it must be curfew hour.

8
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:39,690
Come with me.

9
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,250
Are they gone?

10
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,580
Yes.

11
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,660
This always happens to us wherever we go.

12
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,430
That is why we are a match made in heaven.

13
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,700
I think they are gone.

14
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,610
Sir! Sir!

15
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,080
Where did he go?

16
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,780
Get him!

17
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,990
Stop right there!

18
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,120
You!

19
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,960
Use your words.

20
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,130
I am Park Chunsam,

21
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,200
and when I tell you my story,
you will be shocked.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,070
Am I to go in there?

23
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,770
This is not right.

24
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,100
Get in? Yes? Sir, sir!

25
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,940
No, no!

26
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,140
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

27
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,510
I had a good reason.

28
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,110
Please let me go.

29
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,910
Be quiet.

30
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,480
Didn't you know that the curfew hours
are from nine to five in the morning?

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,250
Sir, sir, sir.

32
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,750
My master is a section chief
of the Ministry of Personnel.

33
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,890
Please get him for me.

34
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,790
What section chief?

35
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,390
You will be flogged tomorrow.

36
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,330
Flogged? Flogged? That can't be!

37
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,330
Flogged?

38
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,760
Wait! Sir!

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,010
We are here.

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,450
Already?

41
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,580
Yes.

42
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,980
You should go.

43
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,690
I will after I see you go inside.

44
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,290
I will go inside after I see you leave.

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,930
In that case, I will go.

46
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,410
Be careful.

47
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,320
A patrolman might catch you.

48
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,190
I am not an easy man to catch,
so do not be concerned.

49
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,200
Goodnight.

50
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,190
Over here, over here!

51
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,520
Can you please go and get someone for me?

52
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,860
Are you listening to me?

53
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,990
You!

54
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,130
What good is
having a section chief for a master?

55
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,800
He is never there when I need him.

56
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,210
Sir! What took you so long?
I have been waiting.

57
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,250
Chunsam.

58
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,280
Sir.

59
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,880
Open the door.

60
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,190
Go inside.

61
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,230
Why are you coming in here?

62
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,760
Wait, wait.

63
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,130
Sir, what happened?

64
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,630
They caught me.

65
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,540
What? But you are
a section chief of the Ministry...

66
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,970
Be quiet.

67
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,380
Spending one night here
is not a serious matter.

68
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,680
I mean, how could you end up here

69
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,050
when you are a section chief
of the Ministry of Personnel?

70
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,850
Sir.

71
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,750
Sir!

72
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,790
This is a beautiful night.

73
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,190
B-Beautiful? Beautiful?

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,359
Wait,

75
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,800
did someone hit you on the head
on the way here?

76
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,000
What are your eyes doing?

77
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,100
You bastards!

78
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,340
You bastards!

79
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
What grave crime did my master commit

80
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,609
for you to turn him into an idiot?
You bastards!

81
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,350
Chunsam.

82
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,550
Yes?

83
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,820
I think I have turned into an idiot.

84
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,130
Sir. Oh, lord.

85
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,830
You fools!

86
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,500
You bastards!

87
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,670
Have you lost your mind?

88
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,870
You became a section chief only recently,

89
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,940
so how could you get yourself
locked up at the patrolmen's post?

90
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,280
I apologize.

91
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,350
Do you know how difficult it is
to reach that position at your age

92
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,380
and earn His Majesty's trust?

93
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,720
Did you not know every official
in the palace is watching

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,120
every move you make?

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,300
When I was your age...

96
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,970
Every hour of every day,

97
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,010
I was concerned
for the security of Joseon...

98
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,520
Are you laughing?

99
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,290
I apologize.

100
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,460
You are impossible.

101
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,870
Oh no.

102
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,210
I apologize. My mind was elsewhere.

103
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,950
It is not polite to let your mind wander
when you have company.

104
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:14,720
During the tea ceremony, one must pay
attention to one's attitude and actions,

105
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,290
so what were you thinking about?

106
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,690
May I speak?

107
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,700
Light conversation is allowed
during the tea ceremony.

108
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,500
Was there ever a man you loved?

109
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,880
Are you all right, Court Lady Kim?

110
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,210
A man?

111
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,320
How could you even ask?

112
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,150
How could a court lady
fall in love with a man?

113
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,090
So there was none.

114
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:57,000
Are you implying there is a man you love?

115
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,300
I am not certain.

116
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,910
But when I think about him,

117
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,840
my heart starts pounding.

118
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,180
Even when my eyes are closed,

119
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,080
I can see his face clearly,

120
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,020
so I toss and turn all night long

121
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,960
until the sun comes up.

122
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,830
Is this what people call love?

123
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,980
This is enough for today.

124
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,110
What? Do you mean that?

125
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,150
Your mind is elsewhere,

126
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,280
so how could you pay attention
to my teaching?

127
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,290
My lady! My lady!

128
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,500
Take care of yourself.

129
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,070
Take care.

130
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,800
My lady, take a look at this.

131
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
What is this?

132
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,900
This is your new dress from His Majesty.

133
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,410
Try it on.

134
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,990
How do I look?

135
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,930
You look beautiful.

136
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,000
My lady, this dress was made with silk
from Jinju that was offered to the King.

137
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,340
It sure is beautiful.

138
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,280
Do I look good in this?

139
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,110
Of course. It looks perfect on you.

140
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,600
Have you waited long?

141
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,940
I thought I might turn into a statue.

142
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,970
Come.

143
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,470
Why are you in such a hurry?

144
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,010
When I am with you, time passes quickly.

145
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,820
I made this with my own hands.

146
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,790
You can cook?

147
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,160
Thank you.

148
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,770
Is something wrong?

149
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,540
This reminds me of the secret missions.

150
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,980
Back then,
even a rice ball tasted so delicious.

151
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,050
True.

152
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,920
I made this because I could not forget
how it tasted back then.

153
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,090
Since returning from the secret mission,

154
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,660
even the tiny wildflowers in the field
that I never cared for in the past

155
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,430
capture my eyes.

156
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,430
How does it taste?

157
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,770
It is very delicious.

158
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,740
Right?

159
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,380
Rice balls are hardly ever bad,
don't you think?

160
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,010
Is that so?

161
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,190
The rice is not fully cooked.

162
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,610
Lord Seong, do you think everyone is well?

163
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,240
After my report to His Majesty,

164
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,880
an official was sent to open
the provincial storeroom,

165
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,920
and give rice to people.

166
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,290
That is good to hear.

167
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,690
You saved many lives.

168
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,260
I could not have done it by myself.

169
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,560
Well...

170
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,800
Have you not heard anything
from your brother?

171
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,810
I am hoping no news is good news.

172
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,210
Lord Seong,

173
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,280
I am certain he is well.

174
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,720
How do you know these men?

175
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,230
Oh, yes.
I almost made a deal with that man.

176
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,070
You were going to make
a deal with a robber?

177
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,200
Pardon? R-Robber?

178
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,770
I did not know he was a robber.

179
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:09,010
I thought he was an average blacksmith.

180
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,440
Blacksmith?

181
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,610
Was he there as well?

182
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,280
Yes! They were together.

183
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,920
For a fugitive, he is bold.

184
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,460
You go and apprehend these men
and everyone associated with them

185
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,490
even if you have to kill them.

186
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,230
Yes, my lord.

187
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,830
Come.

188
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,550
Sir, it appears they have fled already.

189
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,450
Have you seen these men?

190
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,050
No, I have not.

191
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,390
Have you seen these men?

192
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,590
I have not.

193
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,530
Stop.

194
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,860
Have you seen these men?

195
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,260
No.

196
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,800
Look at them properly.

197
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh? He is...

198
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,140
Do you know him?

199
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,640
He bought something from me.

200
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,450
He came with a woman who was selling pots.

201
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,180
A woman who sells pots?

202
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Go and bring Lord Bae.

203
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,490
We must go to the potters' village.

204
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,590
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,440
The provincial guards
who were questioning people have left.

206
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Ibeom, we should move.

207
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,420
Where did they say they were going?

208
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,920
They said they were going
to the potters' village.

209
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,620
Lord Ibeom.

210
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,750
There is no time.

211
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,960
Meet us at the village shrine.

212
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,860
We must stop by the village.

213
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,440
Provincial guards are coming!

214
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,840
Provincial guards are coming!

215
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,210
Provincial guards!

216
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,350
What brings you here?

217
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,050
Where are the robbers?

218
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,250
What robbers?

219
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,720
We received a tip about
your collusion with robbers.

220
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,390
Search everywhere!

221
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,289
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

222
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:43,330
What is this about?

223
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,670
What are you doing?

224
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
Come out!

225
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,600
Everyone, be quiet!

226
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,100
They are not here either.

227
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,870
Take the girls instead.

228
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,710
Yes, sir.

229
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,450
When the robbers return,
deliver this message.

230
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,050
Unless they show themselves
to the provincial office,

231
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,650
all the girls will be beheaded.

232
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,920
Do you understand?

233
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,120
Take them!

234
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,630
Yes, sir.

235
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,280
Are you all right?

236
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,540
Wait, wait.

237
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,950
Are you all right?

238
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,420
Are you all right, sir?

239
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,450
Get away!

240
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,160
This is all your fault.

241
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,360
We shouldn't have taken in
such suspicious folks.

242
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,600
Mother, calm yourself.

243
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,400
I am fine so look after the kids.

244
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,230
Mother.

245
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,870
What happened?

246
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,040
They took all the girls.

247
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,010
Unless you show yourselves,
they will kill all of them.

248
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,620
Many are injured.

249
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,020
I will stay here and look after them.

250
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,220
Sunae.

251
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,090
They are searching for you.

252
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,560
You must flee.

253
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,930
Ibeom, we must go.

254
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,600
If anything happens,
come to the village shrine.

255
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,570
I will.

256
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's go.

257
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,970
Okay.

258
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,650
You will not survive if you go.

259
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,790
He is right.

260
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,820
What would come of it if they killed you?

261
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,260
There is no other way to stop them.

262
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,730
There is only one way.

263
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,030
What is that?

264
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,430
It is getting rid of the governor.

265
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,340
But that is too dangerous.

266
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,170
We are standing at the edge of a cliff.

267
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,240
We must choose

268
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,440
between jumping off
or turning around and fight.

269
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,780
Which will you choose?

270
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,220
I will fight.

271
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,760
Now that we are here,
I want to keep going.

272
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
This is very peculiar.

273
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,480
The governor of Jeolla has requested
for soldiers to be sent

274
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,980
to suppress the gang of robbers
that is wreaking havoc,

275
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,080
but another report claims the governor
of Jeolla is tyrannizing,

276
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,950
using the robbers to excuse his behavior.

277
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,620
Which one do I believe?

278
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,660
The governor of Jeolla-do
was appointed less than three months ago.

279
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,660
Whichever side is telling the truth,
there is clearly a problem.

280
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,070
How about sending an inspector?

281
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,150
Lord Jang, this is the section chief
of the Ministry of Personnel.

282
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,280
Come in.

283
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,600
Lord Jang,
I have something I must tell you.

284
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,070
You look concerned.

285
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,280
It appears that we might need to dispatch
a royal secret agent again.

286
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,680
Did something happen
in a local government?

287
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,780
Two appeals arrived from Jeonju
with completely opposite claims.

288
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,990
I need a man to investigate
which claim is true.

289
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,090
Was not a new governor appointed
to Jeonju recently?

290
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,430
Yes, Byeon Haksu who was the magistrate
of Cheongju was appointed there.

291
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,570
Byeon Haksu?

292
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,530
Yes.

293
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,640
May I see the appeals?

294
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,600
Here they are.

295
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,650
"He is tyrannizing under the pretext
of capturing robbers."

296
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,690
What will you do?

297
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,260
I will return to where I belong.

298
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,560
When will you send a royal secret agent?

299
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,200
I will send one
as soon as I find the right person,

300
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,240
so help me find someone.

301
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,540
Me?

302
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,070
Is that not your job?

303
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,710
Yes, Lord Jang.

304
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,000
You are correct, Lord Seong.

305
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,730
I belong to you.

306
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,740
Thank you

307
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,570
for returning alive.

308
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,910
It is to remain together
even after the mission.

309
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,380
That was my intention from the start.

310
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,500
Do you mean that?

311
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,960
You want to go on another secret mission?

312
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,400
Yes, please give me your permission.

313
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,640
You do not have to volunteer.

314
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,740
His Majesty will select a man.

315
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,910
I made a promise with the people there.

316
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,410
I asked them to give me their trust

317
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,050
for I would get rid of everyone
who is untrue and corrupt.

318
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,690
They must be waiting,
believing in the promise I made.

319
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,090
Will you not regret it?

320
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,730
Probably.

321
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,260
I'll probably regret it.

322
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,430
But you still want to go?

323
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,010
I have learned
there are paths one must take

324
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,270
despite knowing there will be regrets.

325
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,330
Have you waited long?

326
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,460
No, I just arrived.

327
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,310
Lord Seong,

328
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,450
did you not say
you have something to tell me?

329
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,150
I did.

330
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,550
Is it of something important?

331
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,160
It is important.

332
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,260
Does it have something to do with me?

333
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,960
It does.

334
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,770
I am prepared, so you may start.

335
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,210
How may I begin?

336
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,420
You can tell me.

337
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,520
Well...

338
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,050
I am not certain I can say this.

339
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,590
I do not care what it is.

340
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,660
I will do as you say.

341
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
Do you mean that?

342
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,930
Yes, so tell me.

343
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,070
Pour it all out.

344
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,320
Why is it so difficult?

345
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,520
Why is it so difficult to say
"She is my woman!"

346
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,120
What do you mean?

347
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,060
Were you not going to propose to me?

348
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,330
No, I was not.

349
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,200
What?

350
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,670
You were not?

351
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,640
I was about to tell you that I have been
appointed a royal agent again.

352
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,440
And...

353
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,580
Royal agent?

354
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,050
There seem to be a problem in Jeonju.

355
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,020
Ibeom is there,
so I cannot turn a blind eye.

356
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,790
I am sorry.
I brooded over this all night, but...

357
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,600
Do not say that.

358
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,070
You must go.

359
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,010
Do become a royal agent

360
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,350
His Majesty can trust
and people can respect.

361
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,230
When this is over, please be my wife.

362
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,430
That was what I wanted to say.

363
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,950
Chunsam.

364
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,780
Yes, sir.

365
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,690
This secret mission
will be even more difficult.

366
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,190
I'll just have to risk
my life a few more times.

367
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,300
That is why

368
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,270
I am giving you the freedom to choose.

369
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,040
You don't need to come
if you don't want to.

370
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,810
What? Do you mean that?

371
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,740
Yes, you may choose.

372
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,520
Since you are going,

373
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,450
I, Park Chunsam, will not.

374
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,760
I will stay behind and man the house.

375
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,430
Yes, I understand.

376
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,400
Wait!

377
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,300
Are you really leaving like this?

378
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,770
You are not being yourself.

379
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,270
You should grab me by my neck

380
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,210
and force me to come with you.

381
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,950
I always felt guilty
of putting you through everything.

382
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,330
Sir.

383
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,460
Why is he acting like that?

384
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,660
I still cannot go.

385
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,830
How could I go there?

386
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,506
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN

387
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,440
Chunsam, what is this?

388
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,480
The royal secret agent is leaving,

389
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,490
so how could I, Park Chunsam,

390
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,990
an indispensable member of your entourage,
stay behind?

391
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,690
Chunsam.

392
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,590
Sir!

393
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,560
Sir, sir.

394
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,830
You are all I have.

395
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,100
Sir, are you crying?

396
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,440
I am not crying.

397
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,710
You look like you are crying.

398
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,210
Hey!

399
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:54,950
You cried, you did.

400
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,950
Be quiet!

401
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,750
So, what is your mission this time?

402
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,230
Something is happening in Jeonju.

403
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,990
I will know once I get there.

404
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,900
But since Lady Dain,

405
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,070
I mean, Lady Yeongsin.

406
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,800
Since she is not here, it feels lonely.

407
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,840
Do you not agree, sir?

408
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,480
Let's go.

409
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,050
But I did see you cry.

410
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,020
Come!

411
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,050
My lady, a proposal of marriage
has arrived.

412
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,760
Who is it from?

413
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,790
He is the chief scholar's son.

414
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,430
He is? That is great.

415
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,230
I must tell Chief State Councilor Jang.

416
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,070
My lady, I feel I have fulfilled my duty.

417
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,410
What is it?

418
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,610
Are you not pleased?

419
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:14,990
He has never met me before,
so why did he propose to me?

420
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,860
You are His Majesty's relative,

421
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,770
and since Chief State Councilor Jang
is a father figure to you,

422
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,530
who would not want you?

423
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,540
Is that so?

424
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,490
Is Lord Kim Byeonggeun inside?

425
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,490
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

426
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,500
The governor of Jeolla-do
at my humble house?

427
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,970
How did this happen?

428
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,600
Come inside.

429
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,540
Yes, Lord Kim.

430
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,740
Seeing you reminds me of my late father.

431
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,680
He would have been so proud
to see you as a governor.

432
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,520
My father always told me never to forget
the grace your father showed us.

433
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,500
From what I hear,
you must be in a predicament.

434
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,700
After the royal secret agent left,

435
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,970
I am unable to collect as much taxes,
so it is difficult to raise funds.

436
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,940
Who says you can only collect
rice and textile?

437
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,050
What offers their bodies
when they are alive

438
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,119
and offers their belongings
when they are dead?

439
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,490
Do you mean slaves?

440
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,020
That is the source
of all noblemen's wealth.

441
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,430
You should move to a different house.

442
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,700
I am in charge of keeping an eye on you,

443
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,369
so it would not matter
where I keep my eye on you.

444
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:13,610
I need your wisdom.

445
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,950
My Lady, it is Court Lady Kim.

446
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,120
Do not be surprised to read this.

447
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,990
I must apologize to you,

448
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,660
but please keep this a secret
from Chief State Councilor Jang.

449
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,760
I am leaving to meet the man
who has taken my heart

450
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,330
for I believe he needs me.

451
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,070
But more than that,

452
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,440
in this moment,
more than anything else in the world,

453
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,480
I need him.

454
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,260
Is anyone home?

455
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,600
Who is it?

456
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,970
We are passing travelers.

457
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,670
We are ashamed to ask,
but can we please stay the night here?

458
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,750
Y-Yes, come inside.

459
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,620
It is not much.

460
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,360
No, this is amazing.

461
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,020
Thank you.

462
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,030
If I may ask, is your husband away?

463
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,160
He passed away a few years ago.

464
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,300
Oh no.

465
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:21,240
If you need anything, let me know.

466
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,340
Thank you.

467
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,510
Poor woman.

468
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,790
It cannot be easy for a woman to live
in such a deserted place all alone.

469
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,950
Let us eat.

470
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,320
Yes, sir.

471
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,240
I have to pee.

472
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,460
Where is the outhouse?

473
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,560
Outhouse...

474
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,630
One looks sturdy

475
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,940
and the other is handsome,

476
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,970
so you will make a lot of money
when you sell them at the slave market.

477
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,810
Slave market?

478
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,880
What was that?

479
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,250
Are they awake?

480
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,960
Sir, wake up, sir.

481
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,590
They are conspiring to sell us.

482
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,590
Sir, sir.

483
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,530
Dain...

484
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,630
Dain, Dain.

485
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,000
What is he saying?

486
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,300
Sir, sir.

487
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,770
Sir, I am so sorry.

488
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,080
We must leave right now.

489
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,760
One, two, three!

490
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,800
Wow, they fled.

491
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,370
They were quick like rats.

492
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,050
This secret mission will be filled
with hardships too.

493
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,620
At least we escaped alive.

494
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,890
By the way, sir.

495
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,260
Yes?

496
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,460
Were you having a bad dream earlier?

497
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,330
You were like this.

498
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,070
Dain was in my dream.

499
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,940
What?

500
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,140
How scary.

501
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,820
We finally arrived in Jeonju.

502
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,020
We did.

503
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,590
We have returned.

504
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,820
Let us get some food first.

505
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,120
I am hungry. Come.

506
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,890
Yes, sir.

507
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,930
Oh.

508
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,830
Oh, welcome!

509
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,800
Hostess, get us two rice and soup.

510
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,930
No rice wine?

511
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,030
No.

512
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,670
Why is this place so empty?

513
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,870
Oh, don't even start.

514
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,640
Oh, it's depressing.

515
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,710
Let us sit.

516
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,780
This country is full of robbers.

517
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,090
They are all determined to drain us dry.

518
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,790
Darn it!

519
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,220
You should watch what you say.

520
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,460
Watch what I say?

521
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,060
Everyone knows it is true.

522
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,190
Be quiet!

523
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,300
Starting with the King,
they must all be rooted out.

524
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,330
Darn it.

525
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,100
What are you waiting for? Drink.

526
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,840
How dare he criticize His Majesty?

527
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,940
I ought to...

528
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,840
Stay.

529
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,310
If you can't criticize
the king over a drink,

530
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,680
what joy would you have?

531
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,280
Enjoy your food.

532
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,420
Sir, what will you do now?

533
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,030
I need to see Ibeom.

534
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,310
Sir, isn't that Lady Yeongsin?

535
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,340
What?

536
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,170
Over there.

537
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,210
It must be someone who looks like her.

538
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,680
Sir.

539
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,280
What now?

540
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,620
Over there, over there!

541
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,490
Dain...

542
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,160
Lady Yeongsin!

543
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,930
It is her.

544
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,830
It is her.

545
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,270
Why are they here?

546
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,000
Lady Yeongsin!

547
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,170
My Lady! My Lady!

548
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:28,780
Sir.

549
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,090
Lady Dain!

550
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,990
- Hey!
- It's Lady Dain!

551
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,620
- Sir, she is here!
- No!

552
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,260
I found her! I did!

553
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,360
Sir!

554
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,800
What are you doing here?

555
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,530
Why do you think?
I came after you.

556
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,640
Why did you run? I am out of breath.

557
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,270
Because you came after me.

558
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,070
Return to Hanyang.

559
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,240
No.

560
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,480
I cannot.

561
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,450
I am not the woman you used to know.

562
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,450
Is it not obvious?

563
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,820
That is why I am telling you to return.

564
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,080
There must be many
who are worried about you in Hanyang.

565
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,390
Think about them.

566
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,790
Is this how you treat the woman
whose lips you've kissed?

567
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,230
Wait, what? Kiss?

568
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,130
You kissed her lips?

569
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,470
What is she saying, sir?

570
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,440
How could you...

571
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,100
Oh, goodness gracious.

572
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,710
Who steals a kiss?

573
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,640
What? Steal?

574
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,010
People might misunderstand.

575
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,640
Misunderstand?

576
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,750
Did you say misunderstand?

577
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,280
Fine, fine.

578
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,650
I give up.

579
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,060
Sir, she is already here.

580
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,220
If you could force her to return,

581
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,060
she wouldn't have come in the first place.

582
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,930
Yes, Chunsam, you are correct.

583
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,160
Do you still not know me?

584
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,140
When you are here,
you are not a noble lady.

585
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,640
I know.

586
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,140
I came as Hong Dain,
a member of your entourage.

587
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,240
So, as you have in the past,

588
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,280
just call me Dain.

589
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,120
Personal feelings must not interfere
with official business.

590
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,350
Official and person businesses must be...

591
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,260
Of course.

592
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,690
And I ask you to do the same.

593
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,430
I am a member of your entourage.

594
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,630
Oh, yes.

595
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,900
Chunsam, here.

596
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,140
Chunsam, this is for you.

597
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,040
For me?

598
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,310
How unexpected.

599
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,710
What is this?

600
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,210
This is a compass.

601
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,380
Why would you give me
such a precious gift?

602
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,150
I bought it as a present for someone,

603
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,520
but I don't need it anymore.

604
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,690
Thank you, my lady.

605
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,260
Is that someone, by any chance, me?

606
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,100
You?

607
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,030
Yes.

608
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,800
Why do you think it's you?

609
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,100
How ridiculous.

610
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,070
Let me see that.

611
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,910
What do you mean?

612
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,840
She gave this to me,
so I must treasure it.

613
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,780
I said let me see it!

614
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,810
You want to steal this too?

615
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:13,540
Hey!

616
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,780
- Stop stealing things!
- Give it to me.

617
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,550
This is mine!

618
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,480
Give it!

619
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,250
My lady!

620
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,220
No!

621
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,200
Let us go.

622
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,450
Lord Byeon.

623
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,790
Oh!

624
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,290
- Have you been well?
- Lord Byeon, welcome.

625
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,760
Oh, yes, yes.

626
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,060
Let us go inside. It is cold.

627
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,660
Careful, careful.

628
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The governor entered the courtesan house.

629
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,570
Well he's having fun, isn't he?

630
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,010
How many guards?

631
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,210
There were eight guards

632
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,580
and sedan chair porters.

633
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,080
We will stick to our plan.

634
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Lord Ibeom.

635
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,430
Has anything happened?

636
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,300
Many got injured,

637
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,310
but compared to those who were taken,
they are doing better.

638
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,750
You look upset.

639
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,050
Is something wrong?

640
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,650
When I leave,
evacuate with the villagers..

641
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,150
What?

642
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,960
Lord Ibeom, tell me what is happening.

643
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:15,000
I will assassinate the governor tonight.

644
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,800
No!

645
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,070
You will never make it
into the provincial office.

646
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,480
Byeon Haksu is drinking
at the courtesan house this very moment.

647
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,480
You said you would never kill.

648
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,720
The man in the office is changing,
but the tyranny is getting worse.

649
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:40,620
So we must take action
and change the world in order to survive.

650
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,190
Lord Ibeom.

651
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,470
Do not worry.

652
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,870
I will return alive.

653
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:17,530
You must keep your word.

654
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,610
Am I the only one drinking again?

655
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:20,960
Lord Kim.

656
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,130
Welcome.

657
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,500
What is happening?

658
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,770
You sent a man to fetch me.

659
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,500
Sit down and have a drink.

660
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,740
Leave us.

661
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,580
What are you waiting for?

662
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,600
What is it you want?

663
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,840
Your insight is remarkable.

664
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,450
I collected taxes from a slave
who was pretending to be a peasant.

665
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,880
Although I do not know
how he built his fortune,

666
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,320
he was as rich as the robbers.

667
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,990
And I confiscated
all of his fortune.

668
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:38,600
I owe it all to your advice.

669
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:40,570
Look at this.

670
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,640
Look at this.

671
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,510
These coins are lovely, are they not?

672
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,480
This is a symbol of my gratitude.

673
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,220
You are pathetic.

674
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,230
What is the meaning of this?

675
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,700
Is that pittance enough to satisfy you?

676
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:12,340
Watching what you do tells me

677
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,340
you are the perfect prey
for the royal secret agent.

678
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,680
R-Royal secret agent?

679
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,710
The king has been hunting down
idle officials such as you.

680
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,480
At this rate, you will
soon be removed from your office.

681
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,150
Listen carefully.

682
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:37,860
If you do as I say, the seat
next to His Majesty will be yours.

683
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,640
What should I do?

684
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,710
Return home and sober up.

685
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,710
Next time, instead of sending a man,

686
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,820
come in person if you need me.

687
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,060
The seat next to His Majesty.

688
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,140
What is happening here?

689
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,480
Lord Igyeom.

690
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,020
Lady Sunae.

691
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,330
Sunae, what happened here?

692
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,700
The provincial guards beat people
and took them.

693
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,330
We were getting ready to evacuate
in case they come back.

694
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,240
Was it under the pretext
of apprehending robbers?

695
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,710
Yes. How did you know?

696
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,080
There was an appeal.

697
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,680
Where is Ibeom?

698
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,420
Well, Lord Ibeom is...

699
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,800
Sunae, the reason why I came here

700
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,160
is because two different appeals
were submitted to Hanyang.

701
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:25,470
I need to know which is true
to resolve the problem of this place.

702
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:39,150
Lord Ibeom said he will
assassinate the governor.

703
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,050
What?

704
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,690
Is that true?

705
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,260
Yes.

706
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,830
We must stop him.

707
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,560
If he kills the governor,

708
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,160
they will think all the evils in this city
came from the robbers

709
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,830
and send soldiers from Hanyang.

710
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,030
What?

711
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,670
No! We are not robbers.

712
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,100
I know.

713
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,010
Lord Igyeom.

714
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,280
Yes, what is it?

715
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,090
He said it is tonight.

716
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,120
The assassination of the governor.

717
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,930
He said the governor is
at the courtesan house.

718
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,000
The courtesan house?

719
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,230
So he must have gone there.

720
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,970
I should have stopped Lord Ibeom.

721
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,850
Do not worry.

722
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:45,580
Ibeom will be safe.

723
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,470
Chunsam, look after Lady Yeongsin.

724
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,570
Yes, we will return to the tavern.

725
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,810
Lord Seong.

726
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,070
I am sorry for getting you involved
in something like this again.

727
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,910
Do not say that.
But you must return safely.

728
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:18,750
I will.

729
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,660
I am sorry for shouting at you.

730
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,770
I had no choice.

731
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,300
Why are you leaving so soon?

732
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,410
No, no, for the time being, I must...

733
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,270
Go inside. It is cold. Go.

734
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,110
Next to His Majesty.

735
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,680
Let us go.

736
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,590
His Majesty.

737
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,750
Who are you?

738
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,190
What is happening?

739
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:29,990
Drop your swords!

740
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,060
Where are you going?

741
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,060
Get them!

742
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,470
Gyesu!

743
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,480
Are you all right?

744
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,650
Hurry up and get Byeon Haksu.

745
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,830
Boss!

746
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,930
Boss! Boss!

747
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,740
Are you all right?

748
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,440
You are...

749
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,180
The wound is deep. Do not speak.

750
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:06,680
Where is Ibeom?

751
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,360
Who are you?

752
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,330
I heard you were looking for me,
so I came.

753
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,170
You! Seong Ibeom!

754
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:32,010
What trickery did you use this time
to become the governor?

755
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:35,250
Did you embezzle tax money from people
and offer it as bribe?

756
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,650
Or did you erect a stele
with fabricated achievements?

757
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,750
You!

758
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:43,550
You fled for a pathetic girl,

759
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,560
and now you aim a sword
against your former boss?

760
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:51,660
But then again,
what else could a man of such low birth do

761
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,560
but become a robber?

762
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,500
Hold your tongue!

763
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,370
Did you say robber?

764
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:03,640
Are you not the true robber
for extorting taxes and deceiving people?

765
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,840
You will regret this.

766
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,910
Do you truly believe
you can get away with this?

767
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,510
What I regret is...

768
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,550
Not killing you sooner.

769
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,190
Stop!

770
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,230
Withdraw your sword.

771
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,160
Brother.

772
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,940
Leave that man to me.

773
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,040
I cannot.

774
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,370
I am doing this for you.

775
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,510
There is no need for that.

776
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,180
I must kill that man
for the good of people.

777
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:44,820
Seong Ibeom!

778
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,220
Do you think killing that man
will resolve everything?

779
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,460
You do not know what is happening here.

780
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,090
Sunae asked me
to stop you.

781
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,800
The governor submitted an appeal
claiming robbers are wreaking havoc.

782
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,840
His greed and wickedness must be revealed.

783
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:09,010
Only then you could be freed
from all the resentment and rage.

784
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,610
Did you come here as a royal agent?

785
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:19,350
You asked me before to trust you.

786
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,520
But look around. Nothing has changed.

787
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,920
Do not try to stop me.

788
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,200
Think of the people who look up to you.

789
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,670
Step aside!

790
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:36,670
Ibeom!

791
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,570
He needs a doctor!

792
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,410
Guards! Guards!

793
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:51,110
Lord Byeon!

794
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:52,220
Where are they?

795
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,490
Where are the provincial guards?

796
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,150
Get them!

797
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:09,470
One of them is injured,
so they cannot have gone far.

798
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:13,740
Go and apprehend every one of the robbers!

799
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,740
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

800
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,610
Open the gate!

801
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,550
Seong Ibeom, you bastard.

802
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,520
Stop!

803
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:37,560
Brother.

804
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,430
Brother?

805
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,300
Seong Igyeom?

806
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:53,580
You brothers are rascals.

807
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,320
Where is the doctor?

808
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:06,960
He is not far from here.

809
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,460
Come.

810
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,830
It is time for you to leave.

811
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,000
Show some respect.

812
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,410
You better not beg for my help later.

813
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,480
Come.

814
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,960
Is anyone home?

815
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:43,790
Anyone home?

816
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,230
Ibeom.

817
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,370
What is it?

818
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,140
He needs urgent care.

819
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,080
Come in.

820
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:01,980
Hurry.

821
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,750
What about you?

822
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,320
Do you want to get caught?

823
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,190
Go inside. Now!

824
01:03:06,123 --> 01:03:09,107
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

825
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,510
<i>Hey!</i>

826
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,320
<i>Answer my questions.</i>

827
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,920
<i>I heard that the people associated
with the robbers have been imprisoned.</i>

828
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,390
<i>They were sent to the slave market.</i>

829
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:20,060
<i>Slave market?</i>

830
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,630
<i>There is a market where they trade slaves.</i>

831
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:24,260
<i>Where is that?</i>

832
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,430
<i>I must find out about the slave market
in order to appear as a royal agent.</i>

833
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,470
<i>And we must rescue those
who are held there as captives.</i>

834
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:30,130
<i>Yes.</i>

835
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:33,500
<i>Do you have a plan to save them
from the slave market?</i>

836
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,670
<i>Is there a product you are looking for?</i>

837
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,470
<i>Everything we have is of fine quality.</i>

838
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,910
<i>Then I will buy them all.</i>
