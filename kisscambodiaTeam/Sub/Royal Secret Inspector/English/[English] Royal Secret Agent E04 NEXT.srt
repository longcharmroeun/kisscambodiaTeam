1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,830
Bring her.

00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,530
{\an8}EPISODE 4

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,780
Go ahead, run.

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,810
Hurry!

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,120
Dain, run in a zigzag pattern.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,390
You'll be able to buy time.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,930
Do you really think you can stay alive
running so slowly?

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,510
How interesting.

9
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,460
Sir!

10
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,470
Are you all right?

11
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,110
I thought I was going to die.

12
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,810
Would I let you die?

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,010
You're unbearable.

14
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,910
Stop right there!

15
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,110
We should go.

16
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,740
Yes.

17
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,010
Here comes the royal secret agent!

18
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,960
What is going on?

19
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,690
Do not worry! I am here!

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,500
That moron.

21
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,430
He is no help at all.

22
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,879
What happened here?

23
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,680
Father.

24
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,580
I have no choice.

25
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,820
Men! Apprehend them!

26
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,280
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,720
What are you doing?

28
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,920
My horse requisition tablet!
What are you doing?

29
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,629
If you resist, the royal agent dies.

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,129
Bring them.

31
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,980
These two are useful so lock them up.

32
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,610
As for this girl, kill her.

33
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,520
Wait!

34
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
What now?

35
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,990
A child of your blood is alive.

36
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,800
What? What are you saying?

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,870
My blood?

38
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,900
Sawol gave birth to Kang Jonggil's son
before she died.

39
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,880
Is that true?

40
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,280
I asked if that is true!

41
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,190
She knows where the boy is,

42
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,690
so promise you will spare her life,
and you can have the boy.

43
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,030
If you are lying,

44
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,370
I will tear your limbs apart and kill you.

45
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,970
Bring them all!

46
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,100
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,610
Was that why you could not kill
the girl named Sawol?

48
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,580
I am ashamed.

49
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,820
A tiny seed can grow into a massive tree
to stand in your path of success!

50
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,290
I will take that girl
and get rid of the child.

51
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,660
- Father!
- Do as I say.

52
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,770
Do you really think of him
as your blood?

53
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,130
No.

54
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,670
You are pathetic.

55
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,440
You take the other two
and bring them to Hwaeomsan.

56
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:16,580
Yes, Father.

57
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,790
I'm sorry, sir.

58
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,460
How dare you impersonate
a royal agent again?

59
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,860
I was only trying to save you.

60
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,730
I almost escaped, but...

61
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,000
I am here again, thanks to you.

62
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,370
I had no idea
they killed the royal secret agent.

63
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,510
Who could've thought they murdered
a royal agent and buried its body?

64
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,040
But Lord Seong, are you really
going to hand the baby over to them?

65
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,780
The moment I give them the baby,

66
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,550
they will kill him as well as all of us.

67
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,520
The baby will live.

68
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,420
Actually, we will all live.

69
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,390
What do you mean?

70
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,290
Look around.
The prison cells are completely empty.

71
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,590
Don't you find that odd?

72
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,660
Prisoners were all sent to the labor camp.

73
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,800
They even framed
innocent people to send more.

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,010
Yes, that widow, she said
her husband was sent to do hard labor.

75
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,440
Could that be the same place
where Sawol's younger brother was sent?

76
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
They said we were useful.

77
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,750
They will send us to the labor camp.

78
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,280
But sir, what about Lady Dain?

79
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
What will happen to her?

80
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,390
They are looking for the baby,
so they won't kill her for now.

81
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,190
Dain, do as I tell you.

82
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,960
Lord Seong!

83
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,830
Stay alive and return to Hanyang.

84
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,240
You must stay alive too, Lord Seong.

85
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,840
If we meet again, I will...

86
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,880
Be quiet!

87
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,780
Lord Seong! Lord Seong!

88
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,850
You come with me.

89
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,640
Governor Kang Inchung imposed
heavy taxes on his people

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,370
and bribed people of power.

91
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,310
Is this true?

92
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,210
Your Majesty, you need to know the reason
why Governor Kang did such a thing.

93
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,980
The reason?

94
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,150
Does wickedness require a reason?

95
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,320
I am immensely saddened to report to you

96
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,460
that the man Governor Kang bribed
was the royal agent you sent recently.

97
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,930
What?

98
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,270
Chief State Councilor Kim!

99
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,240
Are you using unconfirmed rumors
to create chaos in the government?

100
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,970
There are previous cases

101
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,140
of royal secret agents demanding bribes
as an excuse for inspections.

102
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,180
The reason why local government officials'
corruption is becoming more serious

103
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,510
is because the royal secret agents
who inspect them

104
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,849
are generating corruption
in the local governments.

105
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,920
Your Majesty, Chief State Councilor Kim
is leaping to a ridiculous conclusion.

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,860
So what is it that you want to say?

107
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,700
If this royal agent's corruption
is confirmed,

108
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,600
replace him with the man we recommend.

109
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,210
Are you saying
the man you recommend is reliable?

110
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,340
Chief Royal Secretary Jang!
Are you trying to insult us?

111
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,650
Enough!

112
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,960
Summon those involved
in the incident and investigate.

113
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,490
Those who offered the bribe
and those who accepted it

114
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,900
will be removed from office,

115
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,230
and everyone who were involved

116
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,830
will be demanded to take responsibility.

117
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,080
You look terrible.

118
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,450
Who could have known

119
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,210
that the royal agent accepted bribes?

120
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,520
We are yet to confirm it,
so we will talk about that another time.

121
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,220
You should learn to read people better.

122
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,160
His Majesty is very concerned.

123
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,100
Are you concerned, Lord Kim?

124
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,260
What?

125
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,900
You're using rumors about the royal agent
to cover up the governor's crimes.

126
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,540
Is this a false rumor too?

127
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,310
I hear you have been making inquiries
about the Prince Hwiyeong incident.

128
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,620
What good would come from
being associated with a traitor like him?

129
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,220
You should watch out for yourself.

130
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,590
Come.

131
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,140
We are here.

132
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,280
Where is the baby?

133
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,780
He is in there.

134
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,550
Give me a moment,
and I will bring the baby out.

135
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,060
No. I need to see him with my own eyes.

136
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,990
Lower me down.

137
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,780
Where is the baby?

138
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,090
W-Well...

139
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,390
Attack him!

140
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,490
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

141
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,800
Where is Lord Seong?

142
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,770
What happened?

143
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,770
It's a long story.

144
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,080
If you wish to live, talk.

145
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,850
I asked where Lord Seong is.

146
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,620
I sent him to Hwaeomsan.

147
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,750
Hwaeomsan?

148
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
Why?

149
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,860
Tell me!

150
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,330
I send all prisoners there.

151
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,130
What is the reason?

152
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,770
They need laborers.

153
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,470
I just send them because they need men.

154
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,840
I have nothing to do with them.

155
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,920
There is something I must give you
on behalf of Sawol.

156
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,470
Aren't you coming?

157
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,000
I am.

158
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,500
It's these two.

159
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,270
Just two?

160
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,370
What do you mean?

161
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,740
I told you over and over again
we need more men,

162
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,110
but you only brought two.

163
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,840
Only two?

164
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,110
Look at them.

165
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,220
They are fit and strong,
enough to replace a hundred...

166
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,160
Do you want him to end up in bed
before he goes to work?

167
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,040
Let them in!

168
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,900
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,520
He is a spirited one.

170
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,790
Breaking him won't be easy.

171
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,000
Move!

172
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Move.

173
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,140
Move along! Move!

174
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,990
Sir, are you hurt?

175
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,050
What are you doing?

176
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,590
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,520
Get up.

178
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,360
Now!

179
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,100
Sir, where are we?

181
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,870
Everyone looks lifeless,

182
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,440
as if they are about to die.

183
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,750
Everything was the royal agent's idea?

184
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,330
Yes, he told me to tell Kang Inchung
that I would give him the baby

185
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,800
and bring them to you instead.

186
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,160
He said then I could live.

187
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,170
So was he taken away
after he sent you to me?

188
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,870
Yes.

189
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,840
Hmm...

190
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,740
We will return to Hanyang.

191
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,080
We must go to Hwaeomsan.

192
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,050
We must save Lord Seong first.

193
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,950
We must report this to His Majesty first.

194
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,650
What if something bad happens
to Lord Seong?

195
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,090
He is not as weak as you think.

196
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,060
It will become dark soon
so let us find lodging.

197
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,180
Listen to what I say carefully.

198
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,650
No one here cares about what you did

199
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,250
in the outside world.

200
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,790
In here, you are not humans

201
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,030
but bulls, pigs,

202
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,360
chickens, and insects.

203
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,760
Insects?

204
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,629
Understand?

205
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,399
Just remember three things.

206
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,700
First, do as you are told.

207
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,669
Two...

208
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,440
This insect has a question.

209
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,810
Where are we?

210
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,610
Why did you bring us here?

211
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,020
What should we do?

212
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,360
Chunsam.

213
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,190
Second, talk too much
and you will be beaten.

214
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:24,000
Third, try to escape and you will die.

215
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,510
You are here to pay for the crimes
you have committed.

216
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,010
Keep your mouth shut
and do what we tell you to do.

217
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,310
Understand?

218
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,180
Yes!

219
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,650
It's gold! It's gold!

220
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,550
Everyone, stop working!

221
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,740
I heard about this
when I was working in the palace.

222
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,410
The rich local noblemen mine gold
and keep it for themselves

223
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,550
without reporting it to the government.

224
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,180
It is called jamchae.

225
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,980
Jamchae?

226
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,290
The bribe you received from the sheriff
must be from here.

227
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,760
This was all about gold.

228
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,470
Special Advisor Park was murdered,
trying to report this.

229
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,840
This place...

230
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,810
Is hell that was created by the greed
of corrupt men.

231
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,780
Are you writing a letter
to Chief Royal Secretary?

232
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,850
Yes.

233
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,820
Tell me what the Royal Agent
has been doing.

234
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,670
At first, I thought the royal agent

235
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,400
was a very unusual and peculiar man.

236
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,100
Happy?

237
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,980
But as time passed by,
he grew even stranger.

238
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,450
Stupid.

239
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,650
He treats his servant like a friend

240
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,490
and tries to help the weak despite danger.

241
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,520
Why did I bring that imbecile?

242
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,760
He admits faults.

243
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,420
Separating public and private businesses

244
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,160
is a virtue every royal agent
must possess.

245
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,830
A man who takes responsibility
for himself.

246
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,500
I have never met a nobleman like him.

247
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,040
You must like him very much.

248
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,540
Come. Hurry!

249
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,780
Hurry!

250
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,030
Sir, what do we do now?

251
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,060
Now that I know everything, I must leave.

252
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
How?

253
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,470
There must be a way to escape from here.

254
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,100
Don't try anything stupid.

255
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,310
When one tries to escape,
everyone starves for three days.

256
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,980
There were those who tried to escape,

257
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,610
but they all failed.

258
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,490
They all returned as paraplegics
and eventually died.

259
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,090
It is impossible
to escape from here by yourself.

260
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,530
You are correct.
No one can escape by himself.

261
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,360
That is why I need everyone's help.

262
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,100
Give up making plans to escape,

263
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,240
and get some sleep.

264
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,140
Do you want to work here
until the day you die?

265
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,910
I will go.

266
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,450
I will escape from here
and return with men.

267
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,720
Oh, as if you are some royal secret agent.

268
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,760
Hey!

269
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,320
Do you know who this man is?

270
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,730
Who is he?

271
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,030
He's...

272
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,230
He's a...

273
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,140
A very good man.

274
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,440
As if he's Buddha.

275
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,440
That's enough.

276
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,360
Sir! Something terrible happened.

277
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,720
What is it?

278
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Father, are you all right?

279
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,610
An assassin was waiting for me

280
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,610
at the place that girl took me.

281
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,180
An assassin?

282
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,950
Where did they go?

283
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,950
They must have gone to Hwaeomsan.

284
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,120
Go and bring all the newborns in town.

285
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,190
Newborns?

286
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,260
Yes! Your son!

287
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,270
Do not rest until you arrive.

288
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,940
Yes, sir.

289
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,470
Give me some more.

290
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,310
Oh, look at this.

291
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,720
This is barely enough
to keep me breathing.

292
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,220
They call this a meal?

293
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,990
At least it's good. Try it.

294
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,460
Where are you going?

295
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,400
We are out of time.

296
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,770
You must go and rescue Lord Seong
before it's too late.

297
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,570
I sent words
so the order will arrive soon.

298
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,040
That will take too long.

299
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,340
We are out of time.

300
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,140
I cannot go without an order.

301
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,910
Then you stay here.
I will go alone.

302
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,850
How can a woman like you
go there by yourself?

303
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,190
Then come with me.

304
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,820
I must wait for His Majesty's order.

305
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,030
Of course.

306
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,700
If His Majesty orders you to die,
will you?

307
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,700
If that is what His Majesty wishes...

308
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,010
Oh, forget it!

309
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,070
Just go.

310
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,240
I am going there by myself.

311
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,450
The royal agent must have had a hard time.

312
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,590
Move!

313
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,130
Hurry up!

314
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,510
Are you all right?

315
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,710
Go and take a break.

316
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,950
Who gave you permission?

317
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,650
It's you again.

318
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,220
He could die.

319
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,920
I am the master here.

320
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,420
Get up.

321
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,590
Careful.

322
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,470
If I can't use you, there is no reason
for you to stay alive.

323
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,180
If you are the master, act like one.

324
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,380
How much longer
will you harass the workers?

325
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,120
I should cut off your tongue first.

326
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,190
Watch and see what happens

327
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,830
when you bite the hand that feeds you!

328
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,530
Someone told me that I'm like a scoundrel.

329
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,840
Maybe I will bite the hand that feeds me.

330
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,540
I'll be that dog today.

331
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,410
You.

332
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,640
No!

333
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,910
Sir, sir.

334
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,180
Won't you please forgive him?

335
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,080
What?

336
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,780
He may appear perfectly normal,

337
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,250
but he deserves your pity.

338
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,820
He fell from a jujube tree
when he was young and hurt his head,

339
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,660
so he doesn't know what he's saying.

340
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,930
As his master,
please show him mercy and...

341
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,940
Stop!

342
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,390
You're back, M'lord.

343
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
What is going on?

344
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,170
It's nothing.

345
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,210
A few workers caused a disturbance,

346
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,480
and I was sorting it out.

347
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,190
Your eyes are still alive,

348
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,360
so you must be a recent addition.

349
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,530
Why did you cause a disturbance?

350
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,200
The workload for the weak is too severe.

351
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,210
If you committed a crime,
you must pay for it.

352
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,310
Some have been brought here wrongly.

353
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,850
Is that so?

354
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,750
Fine.

355
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,560
If there is anyone here
who was brought wrongly,

356
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,990
come out right now.

357
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,930
I will send you home.

358
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I was...

359
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,490
Did you see that?

360
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,820
There is none.

361
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,060
Thanks to your ill-advised bravery,

362
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,600
everyone will starve.

363
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,770
If you cause another disturbance,

364
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,810
you will lose your head.

365
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,950
What are you waiting for?
Get to work!

366
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,860
Sir, could you please
try not to stand out?

367
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,330
What good could come
from standing up to them?

368
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,200
I am a royal agent,

369
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,860
so how could I watch people suffer?

370
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,900
I am someone who is suffering too!

371
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,170
That was close.

372
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,010
Why didn't anyone come out?

373
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,780
If anyone did,
they would've lost their lives.

374
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,980
You will soon learn.

375
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,420
Who is that man?

376
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,590
I don't know.
Some say he is the owner of this place,

377
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,130
and some say he was sent here
by someone high up.

378
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,730
No one knows for sure.

379
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,770
But he is someone of power.

380
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,946
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

381
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,780
M'lord.

382
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,960
How ridiculous must they think of you
to act out like that?

383
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
I am sorry.

384
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,630
Bring me the goods.

385
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,900
Yes, M'lord.

386
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,680
The quantity is especially small.

387
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,850
There was an epidemic,
killing a lot of men.

388
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,450
If you are short of men,
increase the workload!

389
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,120
Pardon me?

390
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,260
Yes, I will do that.

391
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,690
I will take this today,

392
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,400
but next time,
make sure you twice the amount ready.

393
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,870
Yes, M'lord.

394
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,010
May I ask you something?

395
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,680
Is this the road to Hwaeomsan?

396
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,920
Yes, it is.

397
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,260
I heard there are many men working there.

398
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,160
Do you know what they are doing?

399
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,560
I don't.

400
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,530
Why do you want to go there?

401
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,140
Someone I know has been taken there.

402
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,370
You better not go there.

403
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,310
I have seen many men go in,

404
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,210
but I am yet to see anyone come out.

405
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,620
Hurry up!

406
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,630
Oh? We are missing one.

407
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,730
Someone is missing.

408
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,440
What?

409
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,010
Search everywhere!

410
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,970
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,580
The old man Kim is missing.

412
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,820
Could he have?

413
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
Listen carefully.

414
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,850
If one of you escapes,

415
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,020
one from the rest will be killed,

416
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,220
and if two of you escape,
two will be killed.

417
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,100
Please spare me!

418
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,730
Watch carefully.

419
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,240
No, no.

420
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,550
M'lord!

421
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,520
M'lord!

422
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,719
What? He died?

423
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,270
Over here.

424
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,650
Toss him outside.

425
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,820
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

426
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,430
Let's go.

427
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,270
Out of my way!

428
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,430
Out of my way!

429
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,710
Step aside!

430
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,140
I didn't expect this...

431
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,020
I would like to ask you one question.

432
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,150
What is it?

433
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,520
Do you still want to escape from here?

434
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,060
What if I do?

435
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,860
I have an older sister.

436
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,100
She was pregnant,
and she must have given birth by now.

437
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,770
She said she would name the baby
Yunsu if it's a boy

438
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,210
and Yunhui if it's a girl.

439
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,110
I want to meet the baby in person.

440
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,690
Is you older sister Sawol?

441
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,990
Yes. Do you know my sister?

442
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,000
Sawol passed away.

443
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,200
What?

444
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,510
What do you mean?

445
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,280
She was killed by the sheriff's son.

446
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,160
Sawol gave birth before she died.

447
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,870
Did the baby survive?

448
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,340
Where is it?

449
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,070
I left the baby with someone I can trust,

450
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,510
so you don't need to worry.

451
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,810
You must leave this place alive
for the sake of that baby.

452
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,000
Sir.

453
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,540
Sir.

454
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,480
He is dead.

455
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,170
What is that place?

456
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,480
It is heavily guarded,
so they must be hiding something.

457
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,880
What could they be hiding
so deep in the mountain?

458
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,290
Whatever it is, it must be something
dangerous enough to cost people's lives.

459
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,490
We must figure out a way
to get in there.

460
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,990
There is a proper process for everything.

461
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,390
His Majesty must hear...

462
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,230
Dain,

463
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,730
how do you plan on getting inside
without any decent plan?

464
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,670
I am going to take a look around first.

465
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,840
They change shifts
at six a.m. and six p.m.

466
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,810
Those are the only times
we can hide from them.

467
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,510
But the term is too short

468
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,480
for you to be able to reach the gate.

469
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:59,960
Has anyone tried to escape before?

470
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,890
There were a few.

471
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,230
So? What happened?

472
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,130
Well...

473
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,630
Don't come! Don't come!

474
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,180
Ouch! That's hurts.

475
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,180
Sir, we wouldn't make it
because of the guards.

476
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,580
What are you up to?

477
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,380
Oh, my heart.

478
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,380
I am finished.

479
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,310
I'm all done.

480
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,220
Hurry up and move.

481
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,120
Yes, sir.

482
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,590
Hurry up and get up!

483
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,690
If you have finished eating, get up.

484
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,260
I will use them.

485
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,950
What is that?

486
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,850
It is a numbing drug.

487
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:44,990
Lord Choi,

488
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,200
you must speak like a slave.

489
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,630
Like a slave?

490
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,600
Yes.

491
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,070
"What is that?"

492
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,110
Have you ever heard of a slave
speak like that?

493
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,940
Must we do this?

494
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,610
Lord Choi,

495
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,150
this look suits you much better.

496
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,530
Why are you taking my baby?

497
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,070
It is just an infant!

498
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,040
Out of my way!

499
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,840
Sir, no!

500
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,740
My baby! My baby!

501
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,950
We are going to Hwaeomsan.

502
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,720
Stop! Stop!

503
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,560
What is this?

504
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,330
This must be the place.

505
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,490
Who are you?

506
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,900
Reveal who you are.

507
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,630
Reveal who I am?

508
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,730
Can't you tell?

509
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,840
I am from the tavern in town.

510
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,810
I heard you need supplies here,

511
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,470
so I came to do business.

512
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,210
Supplies?

513
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,010
Dolsoe, show them.

514
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,550
Dolsoe.

515
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,360
Yes, ma'am.

516
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,130
Oh, I didn't just bring these
for you to only look at.

517
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,570
Here.

518
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,770
But...

519
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,580
We shouldn't drink on the job.

520
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,710
Oh, don't be silly.

521
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,610
Just try it.

522
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,350
It will give you energy,
so it's basically medicine.

523
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,920
And you are not monks,

524
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,660
so why live like one
in such a beautiful place?

525
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,030
Nice.

526
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,740
Come with me.

527
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,180
You may go inside.

528
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,440
What?

529
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,410
You will be paid.

530
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,780
Oh, thank you.

531
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,260
No slave is allowed inside.

532
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,940
Oh, how handsome you all are!

533
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:56,240
I should have come sooner.

534
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,310
Have you no fear?

535
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,750
Why did you come here?

536
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,190
I heard this place is full of men,

537
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,030
but since you are deep in the mountain,

538
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,860
you are always in need of wine and meat.

539
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,600
That is correct.

540
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,170
But haven't you heard this?

541
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,770
Like what?

542
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,120
People my come in,

543
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,790
but they never leave.

544
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,640
Dain!

545
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,480
For a slave, you sure are brave.

546
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
If you don't want to see this girl die,

547
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,960
you better not put up a fight.

548
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,460
Drop the sword!

549
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:29,710
Oh, please.

550
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,010
Try harder.

551
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,350
Dain.

552
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,210
Yes?

553
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,280
Was this a part of your plan?

554
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,090
The thing about plans

555
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,220
is that they often go south.

556
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,560
Why did you drop your sword?

557
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,300
The letter must have reached
Hanyang by now.

558
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,500
Your Majesty...

559
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,170
Chief Royal Secretary Jang,

560
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,140
where are you going in such a hurry?

561
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,680
I was on my way to see His Majesty.

562
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,950
I heard a messenger arrived
at the Royal Secretariat.

563
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,180
Is that why?

564
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,390
You must have your hands full
with the State Council business,

565
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,660
but now you want to look
into the Royal Secretariat?

566
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,760
Why? Is it a secret?

567
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,830
Of course not.

568
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,130
But I should report to His Majesty first,
don't you agree?

569
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:33,640
Something must have happened
to the royal agent.

570
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,140
Is this true?

571
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,380
Royal Secret Agent Park Cheolgyu
was murdered,

572
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,750
and the royal agent who was investigating
has been taken to a labor camp?

573
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:52,620
Murdering a royal agent is an act
of defiance against the throne.

574
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,430
Hurry and send a seonjeonkwan

575
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,700
to apprehend the traitor Kang Inchung
and his son Kang Jonggil!

576
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,440
How dare you speak
to your master that way?

577
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,600
I learned it from you!

578
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,170
I am your master! What did you say?

579
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:12,340
You!

580
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,280
Stop it right now!

581
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:18,010
You fools asking for a beating or what?

582
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,720
My life is miserable
because I have a bad master!

583
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,580
I treated you with respect and...

584
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,250
How dare they!

585
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,150
Unlock the door.

586
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,760
You still think you are a nobleman?

587
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,890
What?

588
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,030
Show some respect!

589
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,160
I could die any moment,
so why should I?

590
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,360
How dare you!

591
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,500
Good job.

592
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,580
You must return before dawn.

593
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,350
Our lives depend on you.

594
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:52,810
I promise to return.

595
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:54,750
Chunsam, come.

596
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,780
Yes, Igyeom, let's go.

597
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,420
I apologize.

598
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,020
Let us go, sir.

599
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,940
There really is a girl here.

600
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:18,770
Who are you?

601
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,180
Yes, if you don't put up a fight,
it's no fun.

602
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,820
How dare you!

603
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,590
You bastard! Stop it!

604
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,930
Dain, Dain!

605
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:38,930
Dain, pull yourself together.

606
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:39,800
Lord Choi!

607
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,770
Dain! Dain!

608
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,330
Dain, what happened?

609
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,500
I don't know.

610
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,600
That was really close.

611
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,750
The numbing drug has worked.

612
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,590
We must find Lord Seong. We must hurry.

613
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,360
Yes.

614
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:59,370
Just how much did they drink?

615
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,010
Sir, we are here.

616
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,040
If we get through that gate,
we can get out.

617
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,110
Let's go.

618
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:07,740
Yes.

619
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,690
Kang Jonggil?

620
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,730
Where are the guards?

621
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,130
What a mess.

622
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,040
A courtesan named Honglang
is hiding here somewhere.

623
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,810
Search everywhere and find her.

624
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:38,810
Honglang?

625
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,180
Is he talking about Dain?

626
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,880
You come with me.

627
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,680
Yes, sir.

628
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,390
What is this?

629
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:16,950
Intruders!

630
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,020
Hey, you!

631
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,760
Have you seen a girl here?

632
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:29,990
- No.
- Yes.

633
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,330
What?

634
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,130
- No.
- Yes.

635
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,030
Yes, I saw one.

636
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,640
Where? Where did you see her?

637
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,440
- Over there.
- Over there.

638
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,010
Where?

639
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,280
Is she really here?

640
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:58,650
Sir.

641
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:00,460
Tell me!

642
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,190
Sir!

643
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:01,920
What?

644
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,340
It's you again.

645
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:22,610
What are you waiting for?

646
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:27,450
Whoever brings me his head
will be awarded with gold.

647
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,390
Sir.

648
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:36,730
Chunsam, draw your sword.

649
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,030
What?

650
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,660
Sure.

651
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,550
What are you waiting for?

652
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,050
Attack them!

653
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,420
Lord Seong?

654
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,230
Lord Igyeom!

655
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,760
Who's there?

656
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:21,970
Do you know a man named Seong Igyeom?

657
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,940
We are here to find him.

658
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,610
Do not be alarmed.

659
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,210
We are his entourage.

660
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,910
Entourage?

661
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,780
Did the man named
Seong Igyeom send you?

662
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,750
Yes.

663
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:40,490
But where is he?

664
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,630
He left a little earlier,
saying he will bring men.

665
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,460
So, who is he anyway?

666
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,960
Sir!

667
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,160
Isn't this when you say,

668
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:28,240
"Here come the royal secret agent," no?

669
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,540
I would love to hear it.

670
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:33,810
Shout it out loud.

671
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:40,220
Here comes the royal secret agent!

672
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,390
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

673
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:46,220
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

674
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,510
Yes, I am a royal secret agent.

675
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,420
Look at me.

676
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,320
Will a royal agent kill a man?

677
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:24,490
Are you sure you are a man?

678
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:26,430
What's going on?

679
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,030
Out of my way!

680
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,640
You!

681
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:43,050
You filthy insects...

682
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:44,680
Get them!

683
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,380
Fight!

684
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,150
Go!

685
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:11,940
Are you okay?

686
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,710
Yes.

687
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:26,790
Run!

688
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:27,390
Dain!

689
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:28,220
No!

690
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,830
Dain!

691
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:30,990
Sir!

692
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,870
Sir!

693
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:43,070
Dain!

694
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,160
Come!

695
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,340
Darn it.

696
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,780
Give up.

697
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,550
You cannot escape.

698
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,320
Let her go.

699
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,790
Fine. I will let her go.

700
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,560
Dain!

701
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,030
Here.

702
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,340
Do not let go.

703
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,880
Lord Seong, it's hopeless.

704
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,790
Let go of me.

705
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,070
Lord Seong!

706
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:33,850
No!

707
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:03,282
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

708
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,450
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

709
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,680
<i>I once asked Dain about you.</i>

710
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,220
<i>She said you treat
your subordinates as friends</i>

711
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,920
<i>and protect the weak.</i>

712
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,850
<i>Dain is good at reading people.</i>

713
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:13,420
<i>She must be.</i>

714
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,360
<i>She saw something I never did.</i>

715
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,760
<i>He has the trust of the king,</i>

716
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,260
<i>so he will become our enemy in the future.</i>

717
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,430
<i>Do you know the easiest way
of defeating your enemy?</i>

718
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,530
<i>Work for me.</i>

719
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,700
<i>Miok, are you out there?</i>

720
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,870
<i>Marriage?</i>

721
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,670
<i>That's great.</i>

722
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,340
<i>You got promoted,
and now you're getting married.</i>

723
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,340
<i>I offer my congratulations.</i>
