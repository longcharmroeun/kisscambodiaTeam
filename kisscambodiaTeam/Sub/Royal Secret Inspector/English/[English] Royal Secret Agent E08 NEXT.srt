00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,270

{\an8}EPISODE 8

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,400
Who are you?

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,470
You.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,480
I should've killed you then and there.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,380
Chunsam.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,250
Yes?

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,950
Take them and go to the temple.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,720
Sir.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,550
Now!

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,550
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,950
Come.

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,190
Get them.

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,260
Lady Dain,

15
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,920
I will stall them,

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,790
so you run and don't look back!

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,829
No, it's too dangerous for you.

18
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:13,130
Lady Dain, I am Park Chunsam.

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,570
Please remember me, Park Chunsam!

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,570
Chunsam.

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,500
Chunsam.

22
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,050
You will regret meeting me today.

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,620
I will lead you to hell.

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,090
You stay right there.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,660
Stay! Don't move!

26
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,890
Move when I tell you to!

27
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,890
I am thinking about how to beat you up.

28
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,900
Just wait. I'm coming.

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,200
I'm coming! I am!

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,600
I am!

31
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,210
Lord Choi?

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,120
Lord Choi, what are you doing here?

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,250
I brought His Majesty's order.

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,850
I am glad to see you.

35
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,060
Where is Lord Seong?

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,520
I will take you to him.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,630
Chunsam, look after Lady Sunae.

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,030
Yes, Lady Dain.

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,060
I will join you soon.

40
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:15,830
This way.

41
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,700
Yes.

42
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,790
I know you are just an underling.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,060
Does the man
who received the gold from you

44
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,900
want my life now?

45
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,540
You should have died long ago.

46
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,140
Tell me.

47
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,370
Who's trying to control if I live or die?

48
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,440
Do you want to know who that is?

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,980
Tell me.

50
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,220
Fine, I will tell you.

51
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,670
Lord Seong.

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,370
Lord Seong.

53
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,470
Lord Seong. are you all right?

54
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,370
I am fine.

55
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,340
Where is Sunae?

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,880
Chunsam took her to the temple.

57
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,850
How are things in Hanyang?

58
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,860
Appeals claiming you are neglecting
your duty, using your position

59
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,820
to gamble and seek pleasure
have been submitted, one after another.

60
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,900
His Majesty sent me here to find out
if that is true.

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,930
That is ridiculous.

62
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,240
Lord Seong went undercover
to catch corrupt officials.

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,440
He never got addicted to gambling.

64
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,210
And by the way, do you have any idea
what kind of ordeal he's suffering here?

65
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,750
I am only doing what I was told.

66
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,020
You have no idea.

67
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,830
Did I do something wrong?

68
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,140
Try to understand.

69
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,670
You know how she is.

70
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,610
I travelled a long way to come here too
because of the Chief Royal Secretary.

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,380
I know. I really do.

72
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,310
Lord Seong,

73
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,750
we still have work to do.

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,060
I know. I think it is time to end it.

75
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,490
Magistrate! Magistrate!

76
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,000
Magistrate, there is someone
who wants to see you.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,270
No. Tell him to go home.

78
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,570
I think you should see him.

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,670
It's that man.

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Magistrate,

81
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,150
I met the man you've been searching for.

82
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,590
What? How did you meet him?

83
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,730
He said he was giving out
the money he stole from you to people.

84
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,730
He gave me some too.

85
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,030
What? That loathsome man!

86
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,940
How dare he steal my money
and give it out as charity?

87
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,370
Where is he now?

88
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,410
He said he has been staying
at Lord Lee's house.

89
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,010
Lord Lee's house?

90
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,810
Yes.

91
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,880
So, he was right under my nose.

92
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,750
I had no idea.

93
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,390
Lady Sunae, please come inside.

94
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,830
I feel better waiting out here.

95
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,270
You go inside and don't worry about me.

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,700
But...

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,710
Yes, I will.

98
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,610
Lady Sunae,

99
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,620
Lord Seong still says your name sometimes.

100
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,790
Lord Seong and I both thought
you were dead.

101
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,530
Has he been well?

102
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,930
Of course. If only he hadn't become
a royal secret agent...

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,530
A royal secret agent?

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Is Lord Seong a royal secret agent?

105
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,370
Yes.

106
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,710
So he has done it.

107
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,640
They are gone.

108
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,100
That bastard.

109
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,440
Guards, search every corner of the house
and find him!

110
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,180
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

111
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,850
Here comes the royal secret agent!

112
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,310
What nonsense is that?

113
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,820
Here comes the royal secret agent!

114
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,950
- Here comes the royal secret agent!
- Here comes the royal secret agent!

115
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,260
Drop your weapons!

116
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,100
What are you doing?

117
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,040
I am the royal secret agent!

118
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,220
You are the royal secret agent?

119
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,350
Yes.

120
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,860
It's over.

121
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,590
Kneel.

122
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,200
Don't forget that the promise I made
of killing you is still valid.

123
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,530
Even if my arms and legs are cut off,
I will roll to you and kill you.

124
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,570
That will never happen.

125
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,940
You will be beheaded
for the crimes you have committed.

126
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,310
Is beheading the punishment
for dabbling in gambling?

127
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,080
Did you think no one would find out
about what you've done?

128
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,520
You probably thought you had killed
everyone in this household that night.

129
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,820
What do you mean?

130
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,250
You were mistaken.

131
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,160
Aeran, are you there?

132
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,410
She is the daughter of a concubine,

133
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,210
and she was here that night.

134
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Mom.

135
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,980
Do as I say, do you understand?

136
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,960
Magistrate.

137
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,920
Here is one more!

138
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,990
No, no!

139
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,200
Please spare me! Please!

140
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,430
Where were you that night?

141
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,770
I was in there.

142
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,510
That is nonsense!

143
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Come with me.

144
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,130
Take a look.

145
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,570
It was too small,

146
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,740
so my mother could not climb in.

147
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,510
Only I could hide in there.

148
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,410
She is lying!

149
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,410
Really? Do you still believe
you can hide the truth?

150
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,350
Aeran.

151
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,380
Yes.

152
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,320
Tell me what you saw that night.

153
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,660
Nonsense!

154
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,390
Do you expect me to believe
the words of that lowborn?

155
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,530
Why shouldn't we believe the words
of someone of a low social position?

156
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,260
Tell me the truth.

157
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,230
That night...

158
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,300
She is trying to frame me!

159
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,200
Lord Lee deserved to die.

160
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,070
He corrupted this town
with his gambling house

161
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,910
and lent money at high interest
to the poor, making enormous profit.

162
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,510
I killed an evil man
as the magistrate of this town,

163
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,350
so why is that a problem?

164
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,250
For this town, on behalf of the people,
I killed that man!

165
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,690
The evil spirit that possessed Lord Lee
has possessed you too.

166
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:15,090
Aeran, what did you see that night?

167
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,170
That night I...

168
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,640
Did not see anything.

169
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,650
She was going to say that
she did not see anything that night.

170
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,220
However, you have admitted your guilt
with your own words,

171
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,890
so you won't object
to me apprehending you, will you?

172
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,020
What? How dare you toy with me?

173
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,970
Apprehend him and his men
and take them to the government office!

174
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,700
Yes, Lord Seong.

175
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,300
I am innocent. I am innocent!

176
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,290
The money you earned by taking advantage
of the people will go back to the people.

177
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,220
Do you admit your crimes?

178
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,030
I do.

179
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,100
However, what would you do
to the high officials in Hanyang

180
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,900
who demands money for promotions?

181
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,370
All I tried to do was to get out
of this tiny town.

182
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,670
Were you planning on using
all that money to bribe someone?

183
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,540
To go to Hanyang,
I needed all that money.

184
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,310
Who hates money?

185
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:43,420
Open the storage and give all the food
he has stolen to the people of this town.

186
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,220
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

187
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,520
Come this way!

188
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,860
I am sorry for your hardships.

189
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,930
Thank you.

190
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,060
I am sorry for your hardships.

191
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,670
Thank you.

192
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,230
I am sorry for your hardships.

193
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,130
Thank you.

194
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,740
You evil man! Heaven will punish you!

195
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,420
I am sorry for your hardships.

196
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,380
I am sorry for your hardships.

197
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,290
Take your time.

198
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,520
I am sorry for your hardships.

199
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,200
It is over now.

200
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,070
Yes.

201
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,220
You could have earned
the respect from everyone.

202
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,060
You are finally going to Hanyang,
the place you have been dreaming of going.

203
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,600
Transport the criminals to Hanyang.

204
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,970
Join us.

205
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,940
I still have work to do.

206
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,310
Can you tell His Majesty
that I will return after my mission?

207
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,340
I will.

208
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,580
Come with me.

209
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,520
Now!

210
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,890
Sir! Sir!

211
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,690
Chunsam, why have you come here?

212
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,830
Lady Sunae has left.

213
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,530
She left? What do you mean?

214
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,900
I am sorry, sir.

215
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,540
I told her
you are a royal secret agent by mistake.

216
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,610
She asked me to give this to you.

217
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,680
I really wanted to stop her,
but she did not want to be a burden.

218
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,730
Please forgive me
for saying goodbye through a letter.

219
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,610
Being able to see your face
even if by passing

220
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,940
makes me feel
I have resolved my biggest regret.

221
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,950
Everything that had happened
in the past was by my choice,

222
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,780
so please forgive your younger brother.

223
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,530
Isn't that the royal secret agent?

224
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,600
He is the royal agent?

225
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,040
- Royal Agent.
- He is.

226
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,270
Royal Agent, Royal Agent!

227
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

228
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,480
I am sorry to say
this is all we can offer you.

229
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,250
What is that?

230
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,620
They are rice balls.

231
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,220
Please take them for your journey.

232
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,590
You don't have to do this.

233
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,030
Please take them.

234
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,900
In that case, thank you.

235
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,810
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

236
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,050
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

237
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,080
I believe your dream of making a world

238
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,820
where noblemen and peasants can live
in harmony will reach the heavens.

239
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,060
I sincerely respected you
and loved you with all my heart.

240
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,270
I will keep you close to my heart
for the rest of my life.

241
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,190
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

242
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,420
Here.

243
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,560
Thank you.

244
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Chunsam.

245
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,800
Oh, yes, Lord Igyeom.

246
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,240
Sir, try this.

247
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,110
No, I am not hungry. You eat.

248
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,860
How much longer will it take?

250
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,280
You are not acting like yourself.

251
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,310
What do you mean?

252
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,580
Why do you look like you are miles away?

253
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,190
Miles away?

254
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:27,730
Your eyes have lost focus,
and your shoulders are dropped.

255
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,730
I was thinking about something.

256
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,070
About a woman?

257
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,830
Wo...

258
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,140
What?

259
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,640
You've been like this
since Lady Sunae left.

260
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,040
Am I wrong?

261
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,540
You are.

262
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,510
If not about a woman,
what were you thinking about?

263
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,510
Relationships.

264
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,750
I was thinking about relationships.

265
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,220
Relationships?

266
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,720
Yes.

267
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,860
I thought about the faces of many people
I have met and said goodbye to

268
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,430
until now, one by one.

269
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,670
And all those people
have become a part of me.

270
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,270
Do you understand what I am saying?

271
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,680
I do not.

272
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,850
Yes, of course.

273
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,590
Lady Dain, what did he say?

274
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,330
He said he was thinking
about relationships.

275
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,070
The three of us meeting like this
formed a relationship, don't you agree?

276
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,670
He can be so silly.

277
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,670
We will find out after this mission,

278
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,380
whether or not this was
a good relationship.

279
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,610
I can't believe them.

280
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,920
Why wait to find out whether or not
if this is a good relationship?

281
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,620
Wait for me!

282
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,440
Do you only live in the moment?

283
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,710
You're not eating or sleeping.

284
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,950
Is there no tomorrow for you?

285
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,750
I lost my appetite, and I am not sleepy.

286
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,850
Do you know why?

287
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,460
It is because your head is somewhere else.

288
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,490
How much longer will you
let your personal feelings guide you?

289
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,460
You are a royal agent.

290
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,060
Do not forget your mission.

291
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,870
Personal feelings.

292
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,410
Neither you nor I would be here

293
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,950
without personal feelings.

294
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,720
Yes, I know.

295
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,290
You became a royal agent as a punishment
at first and for your brother next.

296
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,520
And now,

297
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,130
now for what?

298
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,070
As for my request of letting me
be with you until the end of the mission,

299
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,410
you don't have to worry about it.

300
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,110
Whichever choice you make,

301
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,420
be it your younger brother and beloved
or your mission as the royal secret agent,

302
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,320
I will not blame you.

303
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,620
You make the choice.

304
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,960
Dain.

305
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,030
I have already chosen.

306
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,540
I will not forget
the promise I made to you.

307
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,360
Sir.

308
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,970
I am hungry and weak.

309
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,270
Chunsam, build a fire.

310
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,240
I will go and catch some fish.

311
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,740
Sir, are you all right?

312
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,340
I have to be.

313
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,640
If I feel down, someone gets angry.

314
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,610
Who?

315
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,620
I will go and see
if I can find something to eat.

316
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,940
Look what I've caught.

317
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,640
Yes, you caught some.

318
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,010
I found these.

319
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,480
Good job.

320
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,020
Lord Seong.

321
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,820
Yes?

322
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,090
Stay still and don't move.

323
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,060
Why? What's wrong?

324
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,870
You better stay still.

325
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,830
Why? Why?

326
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,400
You may get bitten,

327
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,940
so please stand still...

328
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,290
Sir? Sir?

329
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,700
Are you that afraid of snakes?

330
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,240
I never said I was afraid!

331
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,270
Is it gone?

332
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,220
No, it is still there.

333
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,380
It is a big snake.

334
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,450
It is on your leg.

335
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,320
I am joking.

336
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,060
Joking?

337
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,860
Yes.

338
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,460
How could you joke at a time like this?

339
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,930
Sir!

340
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,970
Sir! Sir!

341
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,870
Did you scream just now? Did you?

342
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,640
What happened? What is it?

343
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,040
- Something...
- It was nothing.

344
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,580
Wait, something?

345
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,480
Let us go. I am hungry.

346
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,990
Sir, what happened
between you two?

347
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,960
What was that something?

348
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,090
What do you mean?

349
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,830
I am hungry. Let us go and eat.

350
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,330
Bring the fish.

351
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
Something?

352
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,280
The royal secret agent ate this too.

353
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,580
It is the royal agent soup and rice
the royal secret agent ate.

354
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,380
Come and try.

355
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,980
Here is the soup and rice filled
with the royal secret agent energy.

356
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,320
Did the royal secret agent really eat
soup and rice here?

357
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,860
He sure did. He ate in that bowl.

358
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,990
He did?

359
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,660
This will be my lucky day.

360
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,070
What is the name
of the royal secret agent?

361
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,370
It is Lord Seong Igyeom.

362
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,140
Why do you want to know his name?

363
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,410
Who knows?

364
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,710
He might buy something from me
if I tell him we ate from the same bowl.

365
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,850
Enjoy your food.

366
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,050
- Sure.
- Sure.

367
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,690
Hostess.

368
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,860
Yes?

369
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,460
Is the name of the royal agent
Seong Igyeom?

370
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,660
Yes, that is right.

371
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:21,200
Do you know which direction he went?

372
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,710
Lord Seong, are you all right?

373
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,780
I am.

374
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,050
We will reach a town soon.

375
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,220
So just hold on a bit longer.

376
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,850
Yes, let us go.

377
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,100
Sir!

378
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Sir!

379
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,170
Lord Seong!

380
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,970
Are you all right?

381
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,500
He is burning up.

382
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,340
Chunsam, go get some water.

383
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,370
What? Where can I find water here?

384
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,940
Go dig a well if you have to.

385
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,140
Yes. Sir, hold on.

386
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,910
No, I am fine.

387
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,080
Let us go.

388
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,050
I think you've caught a cold.

389
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,090
Did I?

390
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,860
I've never caught a cold
in my entire life.

391
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,360
We should go.

392
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,460
Are you sure?

393
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,470
I am fine. Let us go.

394
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,470
Sir.

395
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,240
- Sir! Sir!
- Lord Seong!

396
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,940
Sir. Sir.

397
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,780
Sir, what do we do?

398
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,680
Sir!

399
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,250
Sir. Sir.

400
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:42,657
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN.

401
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,110
Your Majesty,

402
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,680
I have returned from inspecting
the royal secret agent.

403
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,350
Yes, good work.

404
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:23,120
Tell His Majesty what you saw
of the royal agent's conduct.

405
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,890
Yes. I was ordered by Your Majesty

406
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,430
and inspected the royal agent
on his secret mission

407
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,530
and learned he was carrying out
his duties faithfully.

408
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,970
As for the appeals on his corruption,
they originated from a misunderstanding.

409
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,070
Is that so?

410
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,410
Are you sure it was a misunderstanding?

411
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,280
I saw with my own eyes.

412
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,650
If it was not a misunderstanding,
it must be a lie.

413
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,980
A lie?

414
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,280
Someone is trying
to frame the royal agent.

415
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,890
Who would do such a thing?

416
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,690
Your Majesty, some local government
officials are evil enough to use

417
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,190
their position to drain the people dry
to line their pockets.

418
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,760
What they fear most
is the royal secret agent.

419
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,940
So they will do anything they can

420
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,840
to soil the royal agent's name
and frame him to hide their own crimes.

421
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,910
Do not let them deceive you.

422
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,750
You are correct.

423
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,320
Royal agents are my eyes and ears,

424
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,920
so if I cannot trust them,
who could I trust?

425
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,220
Your Majesty,

426
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,630
this is what the royal agent asked me
to deliver directly to you.

427
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,510
What is this?

428
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,380
That is the ledger Lord Lee Cheolyong kept
of all the bribes he gave

429
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,680
with the profit from his gambling house.

430
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,730
Second Minister Jeong Chilseong,

431
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,430
Left Associate State Councilor Jo Hoyeong,

432
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,800
Director Lee Sunsu.

433
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,340
Chief Royal Secretary Jang.

434
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

435
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,210
Give an order to apprehend
everyone mentioned in this ledger!

436
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

437
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,320
What are you doing here?

438
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,030
They have committed a grave crime
of taking bribes for special favors!

439
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,190
Apprehend them all!

440
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,160
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

441
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,830
What is going on?

442
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,930
Let go of me!

443
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,600
Let go!

444
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,710
- Let go of me!
- Let go!

445
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,970
Do you know who I am?

446
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,780
Let go!

447
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,080
Lord Kim, what do we do?

448
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,920
I believe they are coming after us.

449
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,750
Watch what you say.

450
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,950
From this moment on,
they have nothing to do with us.

451
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,220
This is the royal secret agent's fault.

452
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,660
That royal agent has turned
this government upside down.

453
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,860
Their names will be recorded
in the book of corrupt officials,

454
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,500
preventing their descendants
from ever becoming government officials.

455
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,540
Doesn't it look like the government
is finally becoming righteous?

456
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,150
Pardon me.

457
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,650
Please step aside.

458
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,470
Good work.

459
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,510
How is Dain doing?

460
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,740
She is the same.

461
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,450
Of course.

462
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,980
I feel sorry for the royal agent.

463
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,950
Yes.

464
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,620
Where are they headed?

465
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,490
They are headed for Jeolla Province.

466
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,030
Are they going there for a special reason?

467
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,030
Shh.

468
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,070
You should rest for the day.

469
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,600
Yes.

470
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,470
Lord Jang, I do not have to
go down there again, do I?

471
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,480
Don't worry.
You won't have to go down again.

472
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:47,650
However, if His Majesty orders you to,
you would have no choice.

473
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,949
Do you not agree?

474
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,020
I do.

475
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,420
Miss, pardon me.

476
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,860
Yes? Is there a problem?

477
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,530
This is a dangerous area,

478
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,430
so why are you traveling alone?

479
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,870
What are you doing?

480
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,440
I would like you to take your clothes off.

481
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,250
Come here.

482
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,150
You are pretty.

483
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,230
Who are you?

484
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,470
I am her husband.

485
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,510
Out of my way.

486
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,750
This will teach him a lesson.

487
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,460
Men like him should be made eunuchs.

488
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,900
Sir! M'lord, please, not that.

489
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,470
Go.

490
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,680
Thank you for letting me keep my manhood!

491
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,920
Did you see my older brother?

492
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:12,160
Yes, but it was too brief.

493
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,070
You were desperate to see him, so why?

494
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,800
Lord Igyeom has become
a royal secret agent.

495
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,950
So I could not tell him the truth.

496
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
I see.

497
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,520
I was foolish.

498
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,120
I knew I could not go back
to the way things were,

499
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,230
but I went to see him,
as if I was possessed by something.

500
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,830
He is a royal secret agent.

501
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,900
He realized his dream.

502
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,930
I am afraid one day you and Lord Igyeom
will meet as enemies

503
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,140
with swords pointed at each other.

504
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,470
That will not happen.

505
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,010
Let us go to the town you mentioned once.

506
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,120
Do you mean that?

507
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,550
Let us stop wandering around the country

508
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,620
and settle down there.

509
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,890
Lord Ibeom.

510
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,040
Sir, do you feel better now?

511
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,540
Are you all right?

512
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,880
Where are we?

513
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,780
We were carrying you
because you were unconscious,

514
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:42,720
and we spotted
Miss Gwiseon's house and got her help.

515
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,690
Thank you.
We are in great debt.

516
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:52,060
Don't mention it.
I had an empty room and offered it.

517
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,170
By the way, are you living here alone?

518
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:03,640
My siblings got married, and my father
passed away while digging for herbs.

519
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,510
Oh, no.

520
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,640
I am sorry.

521
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,320
We cannot burden her this way,
so let us leave.

522
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,550
I am fine.

523
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,650
Lord Seong.

524
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,890
It is too late.

525
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,830
My house is humble,
but I think you better stay here tonight.

526
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,360
We should.

527
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,730
I will be with Miss Gwiseon.

528
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,030
Do get some rest.

529
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,040
You are a very kind person.

530
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,020
Chunsam, bring me some water.

531
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,920
Yes, sir.

532
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,290
Forget it.

533
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,860
Oh, I can breathe now.

534
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,460
What is wrong with me?

535
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,820
I have been waiting.

536
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,290
But how...

537
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,580
What is wrong with him?

538
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,650
Chunsam, what is wrong with Lord Seong?

539
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,250
I have no idea.

540
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Just a moment.

541
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,460
Sir. Sir.

542
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,890
Sir, what are you doing?

543
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,600
Sir?

544
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,270
- Sir, it's me, Chunsam!
- You.

545
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,430
Sir, wait!

546
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,740
Sir, it's me, Chunsam!

547
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,510
Sir, sir.

548
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,510
Chunsam, are you all right?

549
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,280
This is bad. He drank poppy seed tea.

550
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,590
What? What is that?

551
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,820
It is the opium poppy seed tea.

552
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,690
It is used as painkiller,
but he drank too much of it,

553
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,130
and it made him hallucinate.

554
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,100
Hallucinate?

555
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,770
Chunsam, let us move him inside.

556
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,770
Yes, Lady Dain.

557
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,910
Did I really do that?

558
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,310
Yes.

559
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,080
If it hadn't been for Lady Dain,
I would be dead by now.

560
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,510
How odd. I have no memory of it.

561
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,880
Of course.

562
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,250
I devoted my life to serving you,
and look where it got me.

563
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,020
If I really did that, it was not
my intention so forgive me.

564
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,950
But...

565
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,020
It happened because he mistook
poppy seed tea for water.

566
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,000
Chunsam,

567
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,700
let us get ready to leave.

568
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,800
We must, don't we?

569
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,670
Yes.

570
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,450
Thank you for your hospitality.

571
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,280
Don't mention it.

572
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,750
Lord Seong, I have a favor to ask of you.

573
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,720
What is it?

574
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,950
I have a cousin in town.

575
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:47,930
She lost her husband and lives alone,
and she makes a living by selling herbs.

576
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,130
Could you please give this to her?

577
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,100
I will.

578
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,430
I have marked her house on the map.

579
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,430
Yes.

580
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,500
Take care of yourselves.

581
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,710
I will never forget you.

582
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,910
Me neither.

583
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,890
Sir, about Miss Gwiseon,

584
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,060
isn't she a nice woman
the more you look at her?

585
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,090
She is.

586
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,290
You looked like
you were about to propose to her.

587
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:27,530
If it hadn't been for our mission,
I would've done it.

588
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,130
That is your problem.

589
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,270
You fall in love too quickly.

590
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,270
Do you really think you can win
a woman's heart that way?

591
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,670
Women are attracted

592
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,210
to men who patiently wait
and care for them.

593
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,040
Don't you know?

594
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,850
- Sir.
- Patiently?

595
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,180
So you're just going to wait?

596
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,520
With women,

597
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,720
you must steal their hearts
at first sight.

598
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,950
The way Miss Gwiseon looked at me earlier.

599
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:51,920
Didn't you see?

600
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,060
Well, I saw your eyes filled with lust.

601
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,900
My heart.

602
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,630
What is it?

603
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,270
A man who patiently waits and cares?

604
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,070
Yes.

605
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,270
Steal her heart at first sight?

606
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,170
Steal.

607
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,140
Women are...

608
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,780
Forget it.

609
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,150
You two would not understand.

610
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,090
Hey, how can you stop in the middle?

611
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,620
Lady Dain, women are what?

612
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,690
Whatever. I don't know.

613
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,490
- Finish your sentence.
- You would not understand.

614
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,800
Sir, I think it is this house.

615
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,970
Let us go inside.

616
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:41,710
Yes, sir.

617
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,180
Is anyone inside?

618
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,710
Is anyone inside?

619
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,850
No one seems to be home,

620
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,420
so why not just leave it here?

621
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,220
Can't you see the shoes?

622
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,920
She must still be sleeping.

623
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,830
What?

624
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,330
It's midday, so what kind of woman
would still be asleep?

625
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,030
Let us wait.

626
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,870
We should check inside.

627
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,170
What are you doing?
We don't have the owner's permission.

628
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,950
In there, in there.

629
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,490
What is wrong?
Did you see something improper?

630
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,220
Why? What is it?

631
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,830
What is it, sir?

632
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,850
What happened?

633
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,810
Who reported this?

634
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,540
They did.

635
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,620
Tell me what happened.

636
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,050
Yes.

637
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,790
We spent last night
at an herb gatherer's house.

638
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:42,490
And she asked us
to deliver some herbs to her cousin.

639
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,700
When we arrived, we found her dead.

640
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,430
Herbs?

641
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,400
Where are they?

642
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,300
They are here.

643
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,040
Good work.

644
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,450
Give each of them some rice
and send them away.

645
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:02,680
Yes, sir.

646
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,380
What should we do about the body?

647
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,790
Throw it outside the town.

648
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,020
No one will care about a dead peasant.

649
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,060
When an innocent person is murdered,
an autopsy must follow.

650
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,230
Insolence.

651
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,700
How dare you order me around?

652
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,200
Guards, get this man out of here!

653
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,030
Yes, sir.

654
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,440
What is that?

655
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,810
Horse requisition tablet!

656
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,080
Horse requisition tablet?

657
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,350
Horse requisition tablet.

658
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,120
Royal secret agent?

659
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,550
Yes, I am a royal secret agent.

660
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,720
Oh, My Lord!

661
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,120
My Lord!

662
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
- Sir.
- Sir.

663
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,700
Prepare for an autopsy.

664
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,600
I will attend.

665
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,970
I found traces of rape.

666
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,280
Assault and rape.

667
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,880
He took his time to torture her to death.

668
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,080
It must be from a personal grudge.

669
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,650
It is getting more vicious.

670
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:18,960
What do you mean?

671
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,520
It is getting more vicious?

672
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,130
No, I mean...

673
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,930
You mean there are more victims?

674
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:25,030
Oh...

675
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:33,070
Sheriff, you answer.
Is there another victim?

676
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,970
Actually...

677
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,010
I cannot believe this.

678
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,180
I am deeply ashamed.

679
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,580
Two women were found dead,

680
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,320
and one woman disappeared and is missing.

681
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,120
Are you even trying
to capture the culprit?

682
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,890
We are doing our best to investigate,

683
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,100
but it has not been easy to find clues.

684
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:04,100
Three women are either dead or missing,
but you haven't found any evidence?

685
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,370
I apologize.

686
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,110
While you were taking your time,
another woman got killed.

687
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:14,350
Lord Seong, the sheriff must have
his own difficulties,

688
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,750
so do calm down.

689
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,790
As the royal agent,
I will investigate this case myself.

690
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,890
Oh, it's you.

691
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,900
He is the royal secret agent.

692
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,040
This way.

693
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,310
Introduce yourselves.
He is the royal secret agent.

694
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,450
It is a great honor to meet you.

695
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,580
I am Kim Daegwang.

696
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,220
These are my friends.

697
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,420
I am Jeong Munho.

698
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,890
I am Park Wumin.

699
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:59,090
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I am Royal Agent Seong Igyeom.

700
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:03,590
Lord Seong, they are the pride
of this town.

701
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,660
These young men have even
studied abroad in China.

702
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,770
That is great.

703
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,970
Use your knowledge
for this country and the people.

704
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,110
We will.

705
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:20,580
You came all the way to our town,
so we must hold a banquet for you.

706
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,050
Yes, that is a great idea.

707
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,850
There is no need.

708
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:30,290
I dare not seek pleasure
while I am on a secret mission.

709
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,260
Of course.

710
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,160
That was thoughtless of me.
Please forgive me.

711
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,500
That is fine. I appreciate the thought.

712
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,530
We will leave.

713
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,670
Please excuse me.

714
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,570
Come.

715
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,410
Who are they?

716
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:57,280
From Sheriff's reaction,
I can tell they are no ordinary men.

717
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,050
They're probably sons of rich noblemen.

718
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,950
They owe everything to their ancestors,
but they act like they are so special.

719
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:08,830
But they sure are handsome.

720
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,370
I almost felt offended just now.

721
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:19,400
Handsome? Who's handsome?

722
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,040
When it comes to appearance, no man
in Joseon could compare to Lord Igyeom.

723
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,840
Am I wrong, sir?

724
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,080
If being handsome is a crime,
I deserve the death penalty.

725
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,380
Yes! You deserve to have
your limbs torn apart.

726
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,620
I wish he gets his limbs torn apart.

727
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,130
This is our guest house.

728
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,760
I had my clerks clean the rooms.

729
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,800
Thank you.

730
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,830
You can take that room.

731
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:52,740
Yes, sir.

732
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,680
And you can take that room
with Lord Seong.

733
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,410
What?

734
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,680
You should get some rest.

735
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,250
Excuse me.

736
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,960
Hey, where are you going?

737
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,500
Chunsam, go to Miss Gwiseon
and tell her what happened.

738
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,000
She will be in shock,
so try to console her as best as you can.

739
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Must I really?

740
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,570
It's not even good news.

741
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,110
Should we turn our backs on her then?

742
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,110
I will go.

743
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,380
I will be back.

744
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,480
Lady Dain, take this, please.

745
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,390
He is becoming more and more like you.

746
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,360
Then he is on the right path.

747
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:55,670
I will take that room for myself.

748
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,350
Miss.

749
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,720
What brings you back here?

750
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,720
Take this.

751
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,030
Why did you bring this back?

752
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,800
What?

753
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,360
Calm yourself, Miss Gwiseon.

754
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,840
The royal agent will catch the culprit
and console your cousin's spirit.

755
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,340
Royal agent?

756
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,510
Yes.

757
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,270
The man who was with me
is a royal secret agent.

758
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,580
This is all my fault.

759
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,520
How could it be your fault?

760
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:08,570
I will make sure the man
who made you cry pay for what he did.

761
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:20,320
Twenty-year-old Kim Joi's autopsy.

762
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,950
The body is covered in bruises,

763
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:26,060
and there are burn marks on the chest,
stomach, and buttocks.

764
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,060
Twenty-six-year-old An-geum's body
showed similar injuries.

765
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,130
She must had been tortured to death too.

766
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,110
The methods are similar,
so it must be the same killer.

767
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:43,940
Sir,

768
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,010
you must catch the culprit!

769
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,710
If you can't,

770
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,610
I will catch him!

771
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,750
Do you understand?

772
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,120
Yes, I do.

773
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,360
I think it happened again.

774
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:02,960
What happened again?

775
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,660
He fell in love again.

776
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,330
Again?

777
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,700
He did not say anything,
so how do you know?

778
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,310
Oh, Lord Seong,
must I spell it out for you?

779
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,420
I will leave this place.

780
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,620
Do not follow me.

781
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,230
If you come any closer,

782
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,100
I will go and
tell the royal secret agent everything.

783
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,460
Heaven will punish you.

784
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,430
What is it?

785
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,600
What happened?

786
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,170
It's nothing.

787
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,510
Did you have a bad dream?

788
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,540
Where is Dain?

789
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,180
Where is she?

790
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,680
She must be in her room.

791
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,550
I am getting a bad feeling.

792
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,500
Gwiseon! Gwiseon!

793
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,040
Why aren't you answering?

794
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,700
Oh, darn it.

795
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,670
Gwiseon?

796
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,410
Did she go to gather herbs?

797
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,610
Oh.

798
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:08,050
Gwiseon! Gwiseon!

799
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:14,120
There are people lined up
to buy herbs, so where is she?

800
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,290
What's this?

801
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,450
Lord Seong.

802
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,190
Did you sleep well?

803
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:45,490
Yes, thanks to you.

804
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,830
Where are you going?

805
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,530
I am going to interview
the dead woman's neighbors.

806
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,230
I might find something.

807
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,530
Lord Seong, you should leave that to us.

808
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:57,740
Magistrate!

809
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:02,940
What is it?

810
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,240
A body was found.

811
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,110
What?

812
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,460
Wait, she is...

813
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,590
Miss Gwiseon.

814
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,530
Yes, do you know Gwiseon?

815
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:28,470
She helped us a few days ago.

816
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,040
How far is her house from here?

817
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,050
It is just over that hill.

818
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,750
Another innocent life was lost.

819
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,290
I am deeply ashamed.

820
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,590
I need to visit her house.

821
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,890
We might be able to find clues.

822
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:55,560
Yes.

823
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,390
Lord Seong, we will go.

824
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:59,500
Just make sure to collect
the body properly.

825
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,470
Let me borrow your weapon.

826
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,040
Are you all right?

827
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,310
Yes.

828
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,080
We must catch the culprit and punish him.

829
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,100
Move over, move.

830
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,300
There are rocks here.

831
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,070
Move over.

832
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,540
I said there are rock here.

833
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,110
Chunsam!

834
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,040
Darn it.

835
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,950
Hello.

836
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:54,550
Am I at the wrong house?

837
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,560
I am indebted to a woman
who lives around here.

838
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,360
I must repay her.

839
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,290
But this is not the right house.

840
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,760
A bow.

841
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,400
Oh, this bow.

842
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,900
I heard there is a tiger around here.

843
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,900
This is to scare the tiger away.

844
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,940
Get him! Get him!

845
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:15,810
Where?

846
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:16,770
Get him!

847
01:00:58,041 --> 01:01:00,989
ROYAL SECRETAGENT

848
01:01:01,014 --> 01:01:02,798
<i>I am going visit the herb shop owner.</i>

849
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,765
<i>He is the only one who knew Miss Gwiseon,</i>

850
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,220
<i>so he may know something.</i>

851
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,320
<i>There was something odd.</i>

852
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,330
<i>She came to me and asked
if I could get her poppy seeds.</i>

853
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,190
<i>Poppy seeds?</i>

854
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,430
<i>You can leave
and get us the head courtesan.</i>

855
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:13,760
<i>Sit, sit. I've been wanting to sit.</i>

856
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,570
<i>Park Chunsam.</i>

857
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,830
<i>Go and get the head courtesan!</i>

858
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:17,270
<i>I said to get her. I did not say leave.</i>

859
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,540
<i>They left.</i>

860
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,840
<i>I heard you send courtesans to banquets.</i>

861
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,970
<i>Igyeom has the patience of a child,</i>

862
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:24,980
<i>so you better talk.</i>

863
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:27,710
<i>You can enjoy poppy seeds there,</i>

864
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,410
<i>so everyone is eager to go.</i>

865
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:30,920
<i>What do you have to do to go there?</i>

866
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,980
<i>Something smells fishy.</i>
