EPISODE 12

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,700
Here is the headsman!

3
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,739
Execute the punishment!

4
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,850
Yes, sir!

5
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,790
Off with her head now!

6
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,190
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,870
Father, Mother,
forgive me for I have failed you.

8
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,710
I cannot do it.

9
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,610
What is wrong with him?

10
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,580
Sir.

11
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,950
Lord Seong, what are you doing here?

12
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,060
Did I not tell you?

13
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,490
That we would meet again soon?

14
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:17,830
What? They are...!

15
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,300
What are you waiting for?
Apprehend them!

16
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,070
Get them!

17
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,010
Do you think you can get away with this?

18
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,980
Don't come! Don't! I'll kill you!

19
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,450
Order your men to drop their weapons.

20
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,520
What are you doing?

21
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,490
Now!

22
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,660
Everyone!

23
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:49,800
Drop your weapons.

24
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,100
Drop them.

25
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,029
Drop them!

26
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,850
Don't come!

27
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,190
Don't come! Don't pick them up!

28
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,460
Don't come near!

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,330
Out of our way!

30
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,370
Drop your weapons now!

31
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,370
Let go of me!

32
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,040
Didn't he tell you to drop that?

33
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,570
So stubborn.

34
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,510
Check if the guards are coming.

35
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,380
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,590
Where is the evidence?

37
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,690
Evidence?

38
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,020
The evidence to prove
that Prince Hwiyeong was not a traitor.

39
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,400
Oh, I see.
Is that what you were looking for?

40
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,230
I do not know.

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,500
Dain.

42
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,340
If you refuse to tell us,

43
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,870
I will take your head
and use that as proof.

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,250
Dain, do you wish
to get blood on your hands?

45
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,650
This man killed my father.

46
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,150
Father?

47
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,890
Are you saying
you are Prince Hwiyeong's daughter?

48
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,130
Yes.

49
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,300
I am Prince Hwiyeong's daughter.

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
What do you mean? I...

51
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,870
I didn't do anything.

52
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,310
That is your crime.

53
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,080
You knew Prince Hwiyeong was innocent,

54
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,280
but you did nothing
and turned a blind eye.

55
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,880
So do not remain silent any longer.

56
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,520
There are about ten guards
transporting the cart.

57
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,030
I heard they have archers this time.

58
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,090
There are two archers,

59
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,700
and the rest of them have swords.

60
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,170
You must cover us.

61
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,270
I will.

62
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,640
We will be counting on you.

63
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,740
They will arrive soon.

64
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,640
Let us get ready.

65
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

66
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,750
Do you remember what I told you?

67
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,480
We cannot take people's lives.

68
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,390
You have my word.

69
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,030
Do you plan on keeping your mouth shut?

70
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,200
I did not know that
Prince Hwiyeong would die like that.

71
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,070
Where is the evidence my father left?

72
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,870
Sir, the guards are coming.

73
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,240
We must leave.

74
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,980
Tell us where the evidence is.

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,110
Now!

76
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,680
I sent it to Hyemisa
along with the rice offering.

77
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,850
It is on its way there now.

78
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,930
Tell me what my father left.

79
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
Lady Dain, we must leave now!

80
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,980
You stay here.

81
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,050
What do you mean?

82
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,950
You suffered an ordeal,
so you should recuperate.

83
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,890
I am going with you.

84
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,390
Lady Dain, do as Lord Igyeom says.

85
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,160
You might get in their way.

86
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,230
What?

87
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,960
Sir, I will look after Lady Dain.

88
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,030
Don't worry about her.

89
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,000
Look after Dain.

90
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,870
I will.

91
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,970
Let us meet at the village shrine
where we stayed the other night.

92
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,440
Yes, Lord Seong.

93
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,540
What about me?

94
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,940
You come with me.

95
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,880
I will get the evidence.

96
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,850
Look after yourself.

97
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,190
Sir? Sir.

98
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,700
Sir.

99
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:28,370
Are you all right?

100
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,150
They went after the rice offering.

101
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,050
Go and apprehend them this instant!

102
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,190
Yes, my lord.

103
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,290
Everyone, come with me! Now!

104
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,790
We will get them! We will!

105
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,690
Who are you?

106
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,260
Stop them!

107
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,210
Look who this is.

108
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,480
Aren't you Bae?

109
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,650
Bae?

110
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,120
I am so glad to see you.

111
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,250
No, no!

112
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,520
Is this filled with gold
and jewels or something?

113
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,860
Take everything but spare my life.

114
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,460
You filthy beast!

115
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,130
You gave me your word.

116
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,370
You want us to spare him?

117
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,210
You do not know the atrocities
he has committed.

118
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,310
I do.

119
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,080
You do?

120
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,110
Help!

121
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,550
Do you know how many people suffered
because of that man?

122
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,490
He must die in order to save many lives.

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,340
Tie these men.

124
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,480
Help! Please help me!

125
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,480
Help me! Help me!

126
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,820
Isn't that the fox?

127
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,420
You are the royal agent.

128
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,160
What is it?

129
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,920
Something terrible happened.

130
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,730
A gang of robbers stole the rice offering

131
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,630
and is now after my life. Help me!

132
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,400
Sir, over there.

133
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,380
They are the ones
who stole the rice offering.

134
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,880
You! This is the royal secret agent.

135
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,320
His father and mother
must also be robbers.

136
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,090
We must apprehend them all
and execute three generations of them.

137
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,620
Come here.

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,190
You! Take the sword of justice!

139
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,790
- Oh, come here.
- You!

140
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,830
Igyeom.

141
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,760
Have you turned to robbery again?

142
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,700
I am only trying to return them
to the original owners.

143
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,470
That is still an excuse.

144
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,100
I do not care for your preaching.

145
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,770
On the cart your men stole

146
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,040
is something that may save many lives.

147
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,540
What is it?

148
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,550
I have not seen it.

149
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,450
I heard the governor sent it
with the rice offering.

150
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,680
Over here!

151
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Over here!

152
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,090
Sir.

153
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,090
The guards are coming.

154
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,020
We must go.

155
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,030
Do not follow us.

156
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,630
Let us go.

157
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,630
Yes.

158
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,870
We must leave.

159
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,830
Let us go.

160
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,330
Come.

161
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,710
Lord Seong.

162
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,950
What happened?

163
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,250
Did you find the evidence?

164
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,150
Lady Dain, well,

165
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,560
robbers attacked them
and took the whole cart.

166
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,160
They're robbers.
They didn't care what was in the cart.

167
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,060
Let us come up with a plan
to get that evidence.

168
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,670
Are you hurt?

169
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,370
I am fine.

170
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,470
That is all that matters.

171
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,740
I will return to Hanyang
and report what happened to His Majesty.

172
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,940
You must. I am relying on you.

173
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,880
Who knows what kind of trickery
Lord Kim Manhui used in the palace?

174
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,820
Even with my testimony, it will be
difficult to change the situation.

175
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,890
I know.

176
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,160
I will get the evidence and return
to Hanyang as quickly as possible,

177
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,890
so buy me some time.

178
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,090
I will.

179
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,230
Look after yourself, Lord Choi.

180
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,300
I will.

181
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,120
Let us open that.

182
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,810
What is that?

183
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,320
I thought there would be gold inside.

184
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,550
This used to belong to the governor,

185
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,190
so it might be a valuable antique.

186
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,160
On the cart your men stole

187
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,090
is something that may save many lives.

188
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,170
What will you do with that?

189
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,010
I will find a fence
and have this appraised.

190
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,040
Let me take care of that.

191
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,410
You have only arrived recently,

192
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,950
and you lack connections.

193
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,220
Take the rest inside.

194
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,980
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,290
Must we sell that?

196
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,290
To raise funds, I have no choice.

197
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,890
Funds?

198
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,700
How long do you think that rice will last
when we start feeding the hungry?

199
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,310
Having a cart of rice
doesn't solve our problem.

200
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,180
We must get to the root of it.

201
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,780
There will be a revolt.

202
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,050
A revolt?

203
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,780
Are you going to start a revolution?

204
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,120
You may leave if you wish.

205
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,460
There's enough rice for you
to take back to your village.

206
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,350
Sunae.

207
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,320
Haven't I told you the master potter's
funeral was today?

208
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,620
I had to do something.

209
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,860
He took us under his wing
even though we were outsiders.

210
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,870
And he passed away,
so what could be more important than that?

211
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,340
I am sorry.

212
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,840
Why are you trying to deceive me?

213
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,240
Be honest with me.

214
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,050
Did you not say
you wish to settle down here?

215
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,350
Did you not say
you wish to lead a normal life?

216
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,820
I did, and that is why I tried to
protect you and the people here.

217
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,990
Does that mean...

218
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,300
I was enraged because I felt
I was responsible for his death.

219
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,070
So I could no longer just sit and watch.

220
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:20,040
Was that the only way?

221
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,380
I am sorry for deceiving you.

222
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,529
Then what should I do for you?

223
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,069
Would you continue to stay by my side?

224
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:57,110
Yes, I will.

225
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,170
Darn it.

226
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,310
Oh, nice.

227
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,750
You should sleep more comfortably.

228
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,100
I have too much on my mind
to sleep comfortably.

229
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,870
You did everything you could today.

230
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,440
Thank you...

231
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,220
For returning alive.

232
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,090
Thank you, too...

233
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,890
For being alive.

234
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,400
What are you staring at?

235
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,610
It feels like a dream.

236
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,040
Is this a dream or reality?

237
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,710
Check for yourself.

238
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,100
My lady, no!

239
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,910
What?

240
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,330
So this is not a dream.

241
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,870
I met Ibeom this afternoon.

242
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,810
Ibeom? Your younger brother?

243
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,310
Yes.

244
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,150
It was Ibeom who took the rice.

245
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,920
I will start searching for Ibeom tomorrow.

246
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,760
What?

247
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,660
Jeonju is a big city.
How will you find him?

248
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,500
Ibeom would never
let all that rice sit in storage.

249
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,570
He will give it to people.

250
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,790
Is anyone there?

251
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,360
Bring me some water.

252
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,810
You!

253
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,780
You must've not done your job properly.

254
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,350
Or else why would
the royal agent come back here?

255
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,250
Where is he?

256
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,160
I do not know.

257
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,860
Where is the evidence
Prince Hwiyeong left?

258
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,130
You came too late.

259
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,500
The robbers have it.

260
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,570
The robbers?

261
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,170
That means...

262
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,380
You are no longer useful.

263
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,950
Wait!

264
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,730
Your Majesty,
Seonjeonkwan Kim Manhui arrived.

265
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,670
Your Majesty!

266
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,640
Where is the royal secret agent?

267
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,080
Your Majesty, sentence me to death
for I have failed you.

268
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,280
How have you failed me?

269
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,320
Tell me what happened.

270
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,260
Royal Secret Agent Seong Igyeom
took his own life while being transported.

271
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,330
Why did the royal secret agent
take his own life?

272
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,010
I am afraid that he colluded
with a fellow traitor Hong Dain,

273
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,110
and attempted to assassinate Kim Myeongse,
the governor of Jeolla-do.

274
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,510
When his crime was revealed,
he took his own life.

275
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,620
The royal agent tried to assassinate
a governor?

276
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,190
That is ludicrous!

277
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,960
Your Majesty,
you must look into this matter.

278
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,290
The royal agent
would never take his own life.

279
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,830
Before he died, the royal agent said

280
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,240
it was Chief Royal Secretary Jang
who gave him the order.

281
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,980
I am being framed, Your Majesty!

282
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,610
This is the statement
the royal agent wrote.

283
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:22,620
Take Chief Royal Secretary Jang Taeseung
to the Royal Inspector's Office prison.

284
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,930
Good job.

285
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,070
It was nothing.

286
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,500
When this is over,
I will find a place in the Ministry of War

287
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,570
just as you have always wished.

288
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,640
Thank you, Father.

289
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,010
However, the assistant royal guard
is nowhere to be seen.

290
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,180
His Majesty must have given him an order.

291
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,050
When he returns to Hanyang,

292
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,020
you must find out what he learned
before anyone else.

293
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,090
Yes, Father.

294
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,900
Lord Kim, are you awake?

295
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,070
Lord Kim, are you still asleep?

296
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,920
Lord Kim.

297
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,040
You should have been kinder to people.

298
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,300
Farewell.

299
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,230
I must look after myself.

300
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,250
Lord Seong, this is peculiar.

301
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,380
There are no guards patrolling the city.

302
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,850
She's right. We raised such havoc.
It shouldn't be this quiet.

303
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,720
Stop, stop.

304
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,620
Oh, I recognize you!

305
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,560
Where do you think you're going?

306
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,130
What are you doing?

307
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,430
Since you are trying to flee,
you must have stolen that.

308
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,930
No, I did not steal this.

309
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,300
Yes, you did. Give me that.

310
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,170
Give that to me.

311
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,810
Where did you get this rice?

312
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,680
Thank you.

313
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,260
They gave me the rice.

314
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,990
Thank you.

315
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,090
Enjoy.

316
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,330
Sir, Lord Ibeom is not here.

317
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,870
He must be the leader.

318
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,770
Thank you.

319
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,580
Gapsik, hand out the rest.

320
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,410
Yes, sir.

321
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,180
See you later.

322
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,410
This way, please.

323
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,780
Lord Seong, what should we do?

324
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,250
Let us follow him.

325
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,350
Chunsam,
find out what is happening in the city.

326
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,890
I am suspicious because it is too quiet.

327
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,760
Yes, sir.

328
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,230
Take it.

329
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,700
What are you doing?

330
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,840
What do you think? I must get in there.

331
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,970
You do not even know what the evidence is.

332
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,680
You think he'll just hand over
what he stole if you ask him?

333
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,850
Do you have another idea?

334
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,990
Wait, that man is...

335
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:53,789
PART 2 WILL SHORTLY BEGIN

336
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,340
Wait, that man is...

337
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,010
Why? Do you know him?

338
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,750
What took you so long?

339
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,650
Tell Bae he owes me a drink.

340
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,150
He is the man who bought
the rice offering from Bae.

341
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,120
What?

342
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,590
He did? That means...

343
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,430
The robbers must be planning
on making a deal with him.

344
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,070
Boss!

345
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,070
He is the merchant who wants to buy rice.

346
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,210
I heard you have a large quantity of rice.

347
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,380
Rice is so hard to find these days.

348
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,020
How and where did you get it?

349
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,890
That is not your concern.

350
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,300
Who cares about that?

351
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,700
I only care about this.

352
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,270
Let us make a deal.

353
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,420
Who are you? Out of my way.

354
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,290
Let us talk.

355
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,160
What?

356
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,430
You just left the forge, did you not?

357
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,040
I only asked to talk.

358
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,150
Wait, wait.

359
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,190
What is it you want?

360
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,990
Did you buy the rice offering
in there just now?

361
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,360
Are you from the government office?

362
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,160
All I did...

363
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,900
All I did was get an introduction.

364
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,640
I saw no rice offering.

365
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,510
Is that truly all?

366
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,640
Good. Meet me at noon tomorrow

367
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,980
at the shed located
near the town entrance.

368
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
Wait.

369
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,860
Do you also buy something like this?

370
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,590
I buy anything that will sell.

371
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,700
Is this an antique?

372
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:44,140
It looks pretty nice,
but it is barely a decade old.

373
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,310
Take a closer look.

374
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,910
It was with the rice offering for Buddha,
so it is no ordinary statue.

375
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,080
Rice offering for Buddha?

376
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,590
Does that mean you rice belonged
to the governor?

377
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,530
So I reduced the price of the rice.

378
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,770
What about that Buddha statue?

379
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,100
Did you not buy it?

380
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,810
Unless there was a jewel on the forehead,

381
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,410
it was just an ordinary wooden
Buddha statue to me.

382
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,150
It is of no value.

383
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:30,220
May I go now?

384
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,220
Go.

385
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,290
Come.

386
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,830
The Buddha statue must be the evidence.

387
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,440
Why don't we buy it then?

388
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,940
What?

389
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
Yes.

390
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,080
What is so suspicious about this?
There is nothing going on.

391
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,750
These are new pots we made yesterday.

392
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,120
That voice sounds familiar.

393
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,860
We only have one of that.
You can come back tomorrow for more.

394
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,790
Lady Sunae?

395
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,300
I will take over, so you should go home.

396
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,200
You need to go and eat.

397
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,700
We will go home then.

398
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,810
Where is she going?

399
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,850
This is really strange.

400
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,660
The guards who patrol the city
have all disappeared,

401
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,630
but there are more men guarding
the provincial office.

402
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,430
Maybe...

403
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,970
What is your business?

404
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,140
Step back.

405
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,410
Is the royal secret agent inside?

406
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,810
Royal secret agent?

407
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,539
I heard a royal agent came to Jeonju.

408
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:06,950
I must speak to him about a wrongdoing
so please let me inside.

409
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,050
That is old news.

410
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,019
He has already left.

411
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,760
He left?

412
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,019
A seonjeonkwan came from Hanyang
and took him.

413
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,760
Dain.

414
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,660
Dain?

415
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,430
Stop calling my name like that.

416
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,930
There are people watching us.

417
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,770
Then what should I call you?

418
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,800
I am the merchant and you are my servant,

419
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,370
so you should call me "my lady."

420
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,370
My lady?

421
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,940
Why do I have to be your servant?

422
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,550
People are looking at me.

423
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,780
Lord Seong, they are not looking at you.

424
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,820
They are looking at me.

425
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,660
What the...

426
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,760
What are you doing?

427
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,830
As a servant,
I must protect the lady I serve, no?

428
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,770
Come, Maldong.

429
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,910
Boss!

430
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,050
We have a customer.

431
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,930
Is there something you are looking for?

432
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,530
Did the monk really say it was here?

433
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,330
What?

434
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,330
Maldong.

435
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,140
Oh, yes, my lady.

436
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,340
Who are you?

437
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,110
I am Hong Dain, a merchant from Gimje.

438
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,720
I am here to see the Buddha statue.

439
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,290
What Buddha statue?

440
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,420
Merchant Kwon told me

441
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,990
that you are selling
a wooden Buddha statue.

442
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,830
Why are you looking for something
of such little value?

443
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,030
Because that is priceless.

444
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,610
It is not just any Buddha statue.
It was my family's Goddess of Mercy.

445
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,480
My family was robbed several years ago,

446
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,680
and along with our fortune,
the statue disappeared.

447
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,220
My parents fell ill from shock.

448
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:43,630
I became a merchant
in hopes of finding the statue.

449
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,670
It was my parents' dying wish.

450
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,500
Maldong, do you remember?

451
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,380
Take a look. Is this the right one?

452
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,050
Oh, Goddess of Mercy, you've been here.

453
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,490
Father, Mother, I finally found her.

454
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,730
Goddess, let me bow to you.

455
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,800
Goddess.

456
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,770
Wow, Honglang.

457
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,050
I do not care what your story is.

458
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,180
Please leave.

459
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,420
Boss.

460
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,250
How much do you want?

461
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,850
I will pay any amount.

462
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,360
Wait.

463
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,090
100 coins.

464
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,030
No.

465
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,900
200 coins.

466
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,030
No, thank you.

467
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,770
How about 500?

468
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,640
500?

469
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,610
I will take your silence as an acceptance.

470
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,280
I will return tomorrow.

471
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,150
Come, Maldong.

472
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,750
My lady!

473
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,760
Boss!

474
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,660
How lucky we are!

475
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,590
What is going on here?

476
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,060
What are you doing?

477
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,030
What am I doing? I am just passing by.

478
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,240
What? What?

479
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,550
I said I was just passing by.

480
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,280
Let me pass by.

481
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,050
Tell me. Who sent you?

482
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,090
What?

483
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,620
Was it Bae?

484
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,790
Bae? That's nonsense.

485
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,120
Take him.

486
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,530
I will beat the answer out of him.

487
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,830
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

488
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,900
Three against one is not fair.
Let go of me.

489
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,110
Boss!

490
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,910
Why do you look exhausted?

491
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,050
I am coming from the temple.

492
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,880
Boss Jeon ordered me to get information
on that Buddha statue.

493
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,990
Really? What did they say?

494
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,760
They said the statue was made
under the order of the governor.

495
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,800
500 coins?

496
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,270
I cannot understand you.

497
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,510
You said you are worth 200
at the courtesan house.

498
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,210
How...

499
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,080
How could you offer 500 coins?

500
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,380
I am sorry, Lord Seong.

501
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,880
I was so deep in character that I...

502
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,820
But take a look at this.

503
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,060
If I do this, just like this.

504
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,400
If I cover the dirt with coins this way,
ta-da!

505
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,230
What do you think? Perfect, no?

506
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,270
Stop it.

507
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,740
Would you fall for this?

508
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,940
Then what do we do?

509
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,150
Should we ask for a small discount?

510
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,420
A small one.

511
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,450
Oh, geez.

512
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,860
Where is Chunsam?

513
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,490
I am doomed.

514
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,800
Stop that!

515
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,030
What are we going to do?

516
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,170
Help me.

517
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,310
Who are you?

518
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,880
Are you Bae Muryeong?

519
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,080
Get away from me.

520
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,360
Are you the one who saw the robbers last?

521
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,530
Yes.

522
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,470
Did they take the governor's belonging?

523
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,400
Yes.

524
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,710
Do you know where those robbers went?

525
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,170
I do not.

526
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:59,210
If you follow the stolen goods,
you may be able to catch them.

527
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,680
Follow the goods?

528
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,890
Continue.

529
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:08,120
The robbers would sell the goods
to a rich merchant.

530
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,560
How do you know that?

531
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,130
Because I did the same.

532
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,300
Take me to him.

533
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,840
Will you kill me afterward?

534
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,020
Are you the assistant royal guard?

535
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,730
Chief Royal Secretary Jang
wants to see you urgently.

536
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,030
He does?

537
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,900
Yes.

538
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,700
This way.

539
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,180
Where are you taking me?

540
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,280
This is not the road to his house.

541
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,780
We are here.

542
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,250
Where are we...

543
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,630
You...

544
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,990
Are you coming back from Jeonju?

545
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,800
What are you doing?

546
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,800
What did His Majesty order you to do?

547
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,380
You have lost lots of blood.

548
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,720
Do you wish to die?

549
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,800
His Majesty ordered me to bring
the royal secret agent.

550
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,200
He did?

551
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,670
Where is the royal secret agent?
Why did you return alone?

552
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,810
The royal secret agent died.

553
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,780
How do you know that?

554
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,890
I saw his dead body
at the bottom of a cliff

555
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,660
with my own eyes.

556
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,780
Chief State Councilor!

557
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,820
No, no.

558
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,120
I was concerned for my old friend
and came to see you,

559
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,520
so why do you look so upset?

560
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,000
Ten years ago,

561
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,770
it was you who reported that
Prince Hwiyeong was plotting

562
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,600
to take over the throne.

563
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,100
As a member of the royal family,
Prince Hwiyeong

564
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,340
raised a private army
which was forbidden by law.

565
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,080
Now that the effect has worn off,
are you trying to use me as a scapegoat?

566
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,520
And for that traitor, you forged
a royal command and sent the royal agent.

567
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,320
Do you think the power you took
with those bloody hands

568
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,690
will pass down
to your descendants forever?

569
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,960
I do admire your spirit,

570
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,030
although it will wither away
once the interrogation begins tomorrow.

571
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:15,000
Do not waste your energy
and get some sleep.

572
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,340
Torture is not going to be easy to bare.

573
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,190
Seong Ibeom!

574
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,860
I need you to check someone.

575
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,360
What do you mean?

576
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,840
We caught someone spying on our village,
and he gave us your name.

577
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,210
This is nothing to Park Chunsam,
a member of the royal agent's entourage.

578
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,050
Chunsam.

579
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,080
Lord Ibeom!

580
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,750
I do know him.

581
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,290
How did you know to come here?

582
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,030
I saw Lady Sunae at the market
and followed her here.

583
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,270
Where is my brother?

584
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:22,200
I went to the provincial office and heard
that the royal agent was sent to Hanyang.

585
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,070
It is a long story.

586
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:29,210
Anyhow, Lord Igyeom came here
because of something very important.

587
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,310
Is it about the Buddha statue in the box?

588
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,520
What? It was a Buddha statue?

589
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,350
How can that save many lives?

590
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:45,390
I do not know,
but Lord Igyeom's life also depends on it.

591
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,970
Chunsam, go and tell my brother
that I will get the Buddha statue for him.

592
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:58,870
What?

593
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,110
How?

594
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,820
How dare he spend the night
somewhere else without my permission?

595
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,180
He better return safely or else!

596
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,190
Chunsam.

597
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,390
Lady Dain!

598
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,620
Sir!

599
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,930
You!

600
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,500
Where did you get beaten up like this?

601
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,030
Sir!

602
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,300
Where? Tell me where!

603
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,100
Lord Seong, stop.

604
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,500
Look at your face!

605
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,970
I ran into Lord Ibeom!

606
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,340
What?

607
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,810
He said he will get the evidence for us.

608
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,610
Is that true?

609
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:36,150
Yes, we are to meet him at two
at the broad rock on Hwasan-gil.

610
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,810
That is great, Lord Seong.

611
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,020
We should go now.

612
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,480
Both of you stay here.

613
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,520
What?

614
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,750
I will go alone.

615
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,020
Sir...

616
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,100
Lord Ibeom.

617
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:59,230
I heard the mood inside the city walls
is very unusual these days.

618
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,440
Please be careful.

619
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,210
Do not worry. I will be fine.

620
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,380
Stay with her.

621
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,150
Something might happen here.

622
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,650
I will.

623
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,240
Are those the men
we are doing business with today?

624
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:42,180
I am sure they said noon.

625
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,810
Here we are.

626
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,680
Why did you come early?

627
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,250
It just worked out like that.

628
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,050
Where is it?

629
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,590
It is inside. Would you like to see it?

630
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,070
Wow, how much is all this?

631
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,410
What are you doing?

632
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,910
Where is the evidence?

633
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,910
You!

634
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,660
How dare you deceive me?

635
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,730
Deceive you? What do you mean?

636
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,170
Rice is not what I am looking for.

637
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,440
Rice...

638
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,970
Wait, are you talking
about the Buddha statue?

639
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,570
What Buddha statue?

640
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,080
You said you were looking
for the governor's belonging,

641
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,780
so I thought you meant rice.

642
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,980
Who knew you were talking
about that cheap Buddha statue?

643
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,560
Why is everyone so interested in that?

644
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:03,560
Did someone else ask about this?

645
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,990
Boss Ibeom did.

646
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,060
Seong Ibeom?

647
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,430
When he heard about this statue,
he asked a few questions,

648
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:13,900
and his face turned very serious.

649
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,740
Boss, boss, boss, boss!

650
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,410
As you told me,

651
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:27,580
I asked around
about the merchant from Gimje,

652
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,790
but no one has heard the name Hong Dain.

653
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,960
Really? So it was all a lie?

654
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:40,700
The deal is to happen at noon, right?

655
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:41,930
Yes.

656
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,670
Let us go to the shed.

657
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,170
Fellows!

658
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,740
Boss...

659
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,310
Who was it? Who did this?

660
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,920
The Buddha statue,

661
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,390
it was about the Buddha statue.

662
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,560
I am here to see the Buddha statue.

663
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,260
Let me take care of that.

664
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,760
Were they all in it together?

665
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,200
Gapsik, fetch a doctor
and have him treat them.

666
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,100
Yes, sir.

667
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,570
Boss!

668
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,690
Seong Ibeom, where is Seong Ibeom?

669
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,230
What? He just left.

670
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,900
To do what?

671
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,330
He said he was going to meet
his older brother.

672
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:02,070
They are meeting at two at the broad rock
on Hwasan-gil.

673
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,810
Boss!

674
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,810
What is taking him so long?

675
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,250
Lady Dain, it has barely been
thirty minutes.

676
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:15,950
I can't do this.

677
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,890
Lady Dain, where are you going?

678
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,460
You cannot go!

679
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:20,760
Let go of me.

680
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,220
What did Lord Igyeom say?

681
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,450
He said to wait here and do nothing.

682
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,700
I did nothing for ten years.

683
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,430
So how could I do that any longer?

684
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,770
This is crazy.

685
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,000
Lady Dain! Lady Dain!

686
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:47,820
Igyeom.

687
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,290
Ibeom.

688
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,770
This is what you were looking for.

689
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,710
Thank you.

690
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,380
What is happening to you?

691
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,750
Well, it all began
after I became a royal agent.

692
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,250
How about you?
What are you up to?

693
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:30,890
I could not sit and watch the wrongdoings
of corrupt officials.

694
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,600
Do not get involved anymore.

695
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,300
I will try to find the solution
for the problem.

696
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,200
You do your job.

697
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,770
I will do mine.

698
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,810
You always refuse to listen to me.

699
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,080
I will go now.

700
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,560
That Buddha statue,
I think there is something special it.

701
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:10,930
Look at the bottom of the statue.

702
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,280
I knew something was going on.

703
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,220
Is he your older brother?

704
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,620
He is.

705
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,520
Your fellow men were attacked by him.

706
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,020
What do you mean?

707
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,160
You attacked them
because you could not find that statue.

708
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,660
That cannot be true.

709
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,500
He is a royal secret agent.

710
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,130
Yesterday he was a servant,
and now he is a royal secret agent?

711
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,440
You cannot fool me anymore!

712
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,070
What are you doing? Lower your sword!

713
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,440
Traitor.

714
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,450
I did not harm anyone.

715
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,980
I only wanted what was inside this.

716
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,450
How can I trust you?

717
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,190
Many men are after it.

718
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,960
I assume it was the assassin
who is after my life.

719
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:12,930
Had I been willing to harm people
to get this Buddha statue,

720
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:16,400
I would not have disguised myself
and paid you a visit yesterday.

721
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,800
There was only a letter.

722
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,710
A letter?

723
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,710
What importance does it have?

724
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,340
It can correct the wrong.

725
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,210
It can drive the lying corrupt officials
out of the government.

726
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,590
Is that really possible?

727
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,420
I will make that possible.

728
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,790
I am a royal secret agent.

729
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:42,830
Trust me.

730
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,600
Can I trust him?

731
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,970
You can trust him.

732
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,790
Take it.

733
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,890
This is what you were looking for.

734
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,230
Your word...

735
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,840
You must keep your word.

736
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,370
I will.

737
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,840
What will you do now?

738
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,950
I must return to where I belong.

739
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,450
Let us go.

740
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,090
Ibeom.

741
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,500
Please...

742
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:04,140
Please look after yourself.

743
01:01:59,602 --> 01:02:02,565
ROYAL SECRET AGENT

744
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,030
<i>Your Majesty, have you decided?</i>

745
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,530
<i>Do as you wish.</i>

746
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,560
<i>Are you awake?</i>

747
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,060
<i>We have no time to waste.</i>

748
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,130
<i>Let us return to Hanyang.</i>

749
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,470
<i>Prisoner, hear this.</i>

750
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:14,200
<i>According to the King's command,
your limbs will be severed,</i>

751
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,910
<i>and they will be scattered
around the country.</i>

752
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,670
<i>Chop his head off!</i>

753
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,640
<i>Here comes the royal secret agent!</i>

754
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,920
<i>How dare you appear here
as a royal agent?</i>

755
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,790
<i>It is the royal agent's duty to go
where there are corrupt officials.</i>

756
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,590
<i>I must follow the King's command
and appear in the palace,</i>

757
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,020
<i>If there are corrupt officials
in the palace.</i>
