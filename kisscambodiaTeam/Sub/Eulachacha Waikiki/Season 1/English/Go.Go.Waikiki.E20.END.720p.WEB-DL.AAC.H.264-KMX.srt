Yoon Ah.

5
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:39,368
It's been a long time.

6
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:42,232
You...

7
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:43,872
Have you been doing well?

8
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:47,222
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,759
I wanted to beg you for forgiveness.

10
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,689
Though I know I probably
won't be able be forgiven.

11
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:57,594
I don't need this, so just leave.

12
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:01,957
- Yoon Ah...
- I said, please just leave!

13
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:08,081
Yoon Ah, what's wrong?

14
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:09,903
Who is this person?

15
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:12,745
Who is he that you're like this?

16
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:39,150
I didn't know.

17
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,570
I really didn't know.

18
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,421
I'm sorry, Yoon Ah.

19
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:45,320
I'm really sorry.

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,688
You don't need to be sorry.

21
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:52,055
Sol is my baby
who has nothing to do with you.

22
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,790
I will take responsibility.

23
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,965
I'll take responsibility for all of it.

24
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,492
Responsibility?

25
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:03,989
How will you do that?

26
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,384
Where were you when I was going through
hardship to show up now and say that?

27
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,169
You weren't there with me
when every day felt like hell.

28
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:14,411
You didn't even call once.

29
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,781
Someone else grabbed
on to my hand in that moment.

30
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:23,355
And right now...

31
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:26,472
I love that person.

32
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:30,092
- Yoon Ah.
- Stop it.

33
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:35,739
I made the decision to have Sol and she's
my baby who has nothing to with you.

34
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,020
We broke up back then.

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,859
So, let's live like
we don't exist to one another.

36
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,709
Farewell.

37
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,426
Yoon Ah.

38
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:48,890
Yoon Ah!

39
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:54,282
Let's go, Dong Gu.

40
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:15,122
Kang Seo Jin,
what did you just mean by that?

41
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:16,993
What do you mean,
you need time to think?

42
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:20,532
Let's rethink our relationship.

43
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:22,566
Rethink what?

44
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,925
Why are you suddenly being this way, huh?

45
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:30,195
Is it because I broke my promise today?
Or is it the scandal?

46
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:34,644
What is it? You need to tell me
in order for me to know.

47
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:36,123
Everything is just hard.

48
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:38,645
It's hard being unable to see you
because you're busy.

49
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:40,917
It's hard being unable
to go on dates with you.

50
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:44,625
It's hard to have to hide that
you're boyfriend too.

51
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:53,174
All right.

52
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:56,967
Then I'll reveal everything to the
reporters and make it right.

53
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:59,182
- Then will it be okay?
- Don't do that.

54
00:03:59,182 --> 00:04:02,683
You suffered for so long and
things are finally working out for you.

55
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:03,985
I don't want to get in the way.

56
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:05,995
You don't like this or that.

57
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,891
What do you want me to do, then?

58
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,842
I don't know either!

59
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:12,665
It's just hard, so what can I do?

60
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:16,872
I feel upset and miserable.
What do I do about that?

61
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:25,358
I thought I was very strong.

62
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:31,177
Joon Ki, I don't want
to see you right now.

63
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:33,596
Can you leave now?

64
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,745
- Seo Jin.
- Please leave.

65
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:38,190
Just get out!

66
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:40,903

What? Do I get better looking
the more you look at me?

83

I'm just kidding.
Why take it so seriously?

There are things
you shouldn't joke about.

00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:09,634
What kind of joke is that?

86
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:12,783
Is this something to take so seriously?

87
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:15,149
Forget it. Don't talk to me, you pig.

88
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:17,557
She's calling me a pig again.

You're back? How was your date?

92
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,392
Why is the mood like this?

93

Did something happen?

98

What? Sol's dad showed up?

99
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,944

What was the reason?

100

I don't know.
It wasn't the right time to ask either.

Do you want to wear it too?

What? Why do I keep
thinking about Doo Shik? Why?

110
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:31,223
I'm seriously going nuts.

111
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:37,114
They hospital told me
not to drink too much.

112
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,393
Oh, whatever!

113
00:08:57,462 --> 00:09:02,152

I don't like him much at all.

That's a relief.

118
00:09:19,884 --> 00:09:23,123
No, even 20 percent means
that I like him.

119
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:26,669
Gosh, things got even more complicated.

120
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,267

What is it to you
whether I drink or not, you pig?

139
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:38,745
Hey, why do you keep calling me a pig?

140
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:39,745
It's so childish.

00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:43,250
Yeah, I'm childish.
I didn't even go to kindergarten.

Also, why don't you clean up?
What is this? So dirty.

Why do you keep doing this?

171
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:32,775
I told you I had nothing to say to you!

172
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:35,235
What is it? What's wrong, Yoon Ah?

173
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,235
Who is it?

174
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:38,995
Come talk to me.

Seriously, why are you doing this?

178
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:55,023
I said we should act like
we don't exist to one another.

00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:57,076
Nothing changes even if you do this.

180
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,417
I'm not asking you to accept me.

181
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,765
I have no right to do that.

182
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:06,249
Yoon Ah, I know I have no right.

183
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:09,344
But that doesn't change
the fact that I'm Sol's dad.

184
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,451
I know I'm being shameless.

185
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,567
I want to do everything for Sol that
I haven't been able to all this time.

186
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,715
And be forgiven a little bit.

187
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,835
- You can't let me do that?
- No.

188
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,129
I can't.

189
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:25,351
I'm telling you one more time.

190
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:29,604
Sol is my daughter.
She has nothing to do with you.

191
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,067
So, don't show up here again.

192
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:38,041
Why is Sol's dad here?

193
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,647
Yeah, I wonder why.
I hope Yoon Ah is okay.

194
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:47,703
I will get going now.

195
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,351
Daddy.

196
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:12,076
Hm?

197
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:21,186
Sorry for the trouble.
I'll be going now.

198
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:23,756
Goodbye.

199
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:38,687
Sol just said "daddy," didn't she?

200
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:40,836
- Right?
- Yes.

201
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:45,855
Wow, she never said it
when Dong Gu practiced with her.

202
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:47,793
That's amazing.

203
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:49,880
They say blood connections are strong.

204
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,200
I guess that's not wrong, right?

205
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,350
Hey.

206
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,818
- I'm going to go rest.
- Okay.

207
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,511
Hey, do you have no common sense?

208
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:06,265
What did I do?

209
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,283
What are you doing?

210
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,815
I was just playing with Sol.

211
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,258
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:37,522
For what?

213
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,783
He won't show up again.

214
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:44,932
So don't worry about him, okay?

215
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:47,451
Oh, I wasn't worried at all.

216
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,212
Why would I worry about that?

217
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:52,077
Don't worry, Yoon Ah.

218
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:55,910
That's good, then.

219
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:03,198
I heard you've been
waiting since morning.

220
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,979
Why? Is something going on?

221
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,393
Well...

222
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:13,860
Chairman, I want to reveal that my
dating scandal with Cindy is untrue.

223
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,528
What?

224
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:17,219
What are you talking about?

225
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:19,268
I have someone I love.

226
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:23,748
I don't think what I'm doing right now
is the right way to treat her.

227
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:26,333
Wow, Lee Joon Ki.

228
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,104
You are a romantic.

229
00:16:28,104 --> 00:16:29,692
It's very romantic.

230
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:30,725
Pardon?

231
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,918
You think you have the freedom
to play around with love?

232
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:36,169
No, Chairman. That's not it...

233
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,168
Don't play around.
You've only done one drama.

234
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,360
There's a truckload of actors

235
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,230
who have disappeared
after something like this.

236
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,280
You think you're safe from that?

237
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,196
I'll work really hard. I'll work--

238
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:51,844
If working hard made you a star,
who wouldn't be a star in this world?

239
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,773
Do you know what those people
were all lacking?

240
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,828
Luck and chance... chance.

241
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:04,489
Yet, you're saying you're going to throw
away that once in a lifetime chance?

242
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:11,146
It's up to you whether you want to
reveal the truth to the press or not.

243
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:15,784
However, the moment that you do,
our contract is finished.

244
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,890
For now, move into a new place.

245
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,549
What?

246
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,180
Why do you need me to move?

247
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,859
Reporters will be in front of your home.

248
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,789
We need to stretch this out
for about a week.

249
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,115
Joon Ki, you can live here for now.

250
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:45,803
I asked them to delay filming,
so don't worry about that.

251
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,473
<i>[Joon Ki]</i>

252
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:16,070
I was taking a look
at the script yesterday.

253
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,780
I'm not so happy with the ending.

254
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,661
Is there a twist we could put in?

255
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:23,191
- A twist?
- I don't need your input.

256
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:25,099
I'd like to hear what Dong Gu says.

257
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:28,755
Look at him. He has an idea coming.
Be quiet, everyone.

258
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:31,733
Dong Gu, what is it?
Is something coming to you again?

259
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:34,553
<i>[Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad...]</i>

260
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,816
Dad! Dad!

261
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,683
Dad, dad... What do you mean?

262
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:44,364
Ah, so he succeeds in the assassination,
but the person he killed is his dad.

263
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:45,747
That's not bad.

264
00:18:45,747 --> 00:18:49,534
The main character is Korean,
so how can his dad be Arabian?

265
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:50,773
Why not?

266
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:53,055
He was adopted into an
Arabian family when he was young.

267
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,262
He went out to play and got lost.

268
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:58,762
Then he got on the wrong boat and
it was a boat headed to Korea, right?

269
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,010
- What? I don't know about that.
- Be quiet.

270
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,790
Kang Dong Gu, you did it again.

271
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,604
I'm going to retire after this film.
Dong Gu, you can be director then.

272
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,028
I've lost to you.

273
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:12,238
If you need decisions on anything,
just ask Dong Gu.

274
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,071
Dong Gu is on the same level
as me from now on.

275
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,316
Director Kang, I'm trusting you.

276
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:20,459
What? Okay.

277
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,115
Director, Director...

278
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:32,423
Yes, I'll need it before I go to Dubai.
Is it possible?

279
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:36,181
What? Then please check and let me know.

280
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,412
Okay.

281
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,712
Gosh, I'm so busy.

282
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,343
Oh.

283
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:46,962
That's the doll that Sol likes.

284
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,023
Come on. Come on.

285
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:53,445
I don't have time.

286
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:57,724
Get up, get up. Again, again.

287
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:01,224
Oh, oh! Oh no!

288
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:04,941
Come out. Come on out.

289
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:10,762
What's with you?
I won't go home without you!

290
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:14,806
- Sol, I'm home!
- You're here?

291
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:18,213
Yes, I needed something from home.

292
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:21,318
- What is all of this?
- Huh?

293
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:26,740
Oh, a secretary working for Sol's dad
came and left them here.

294
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:34,673
- Dong Gu, you're home?
- Yes.

295
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:37,266
- Dong Gu, this is--
- Yoon Ah.

296
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:40,178
I'm busy and I need something.

297
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:54,602
Hm, what's with her?

298
00:20:54,602 --> 00:20:56,733
Is she Gollum or what?

299
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:02,291
Hey, what are you, a miner?

300
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,794
Are you looking for coal?

301
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:05,893
What have you been looking for?

302
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:08,496
I said mind your own business,
you dog-nosed monkey.

303
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:11,144
Dog-nosed monkey?

304
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,917
Are you crazy? Why, you...

305
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:17,434
I can't even curse at you
in front of Sol.

306
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,913
Sol, what's this?
Why are you holding paper?

307
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:25,170
Looks like something's written on it.

308
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:29,502
No!

309
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:31,295
Give that to me.

310
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:32,548
Why? What is it?

311
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:34,336
Let go. You don't need to know.

312
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,840
Oh, now I'm more curious.

313
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,208
- What is it?
- No, you can't see it.

314
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,278
- Hey, hey.
- That hurts.

315
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:42,556
Just let me see it.

316
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,173
You little...

317
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:48,326
Hey, hey! What are you doing, Min Su Ah?

318
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:50,035
What are you doing?

319
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:52,825
Hey! Oh!

320
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:56,713
Are you really eating paper right now?

321
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:01,328
Ah, look at that.

322
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:03,844
I ate it all. What are you going to do?

323
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:12,522
She really is a psycho. She's a psycho.

324
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,287
Oh, that was a really close call.

325
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,852
Why was Sol holding on to that anyway?

326
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:26,872
How did that happen?

327
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:30,957
Oh, who cares? I didn't get caught.

328
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:33,098
Ah...

329
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,636
Oh, my stomach hurts.

330
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,253
It's acting up again.

331
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:58,105
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

332
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,244
It seems like gastrospasms.

333
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:02,989
- What have you eaten?
- What?

334
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:08,569
- I drank a bit yesterday.
- And?

335
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,108
Nothing else.

336
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:13,278
What are you talking about?
You ate paper earlier.

337
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:15,384
- What paper?
- Sketchbook paper.

338
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:17,858
What? Why did you eat that?

339
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:20,970
- Did you mistake it for appetizers?
- It's not like that!

340
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:25,692
Please stop talking and do something.

341
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:28,959
Okay, we'll do some blood work
and an endoscopy.

342
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,372
Okay.

343
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,679
What's with you lately?

344
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,641
I can't understand you at all.

345
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:46,127
<i>Inside of me</i>

346
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:51,625
<i>there is so much of me.</i>

347
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,978
Doctor, what is inside of me?

348
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:59,989
There is a small cyst
and some inflammation.

349
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:01,605
Really?

350
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:07,000
<i>Inside of me</i>

351
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,213
<i>there are so many cysts.</i>

352
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:14,978
Patient, it's not too bad.
You can stop singing now.

353
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:17,202
Please give that back, okay?

354
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,464
I finally got it back.
Move him out before he takes it back.

355
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,068
Yes, Doctor.

356
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:26,035
<i>Inside of me...</i>

357
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,050
Bring in the next patient!

358
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:35,786
- Let me put this on you.
- Okay.

359
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:41,329
Patient, I'll start the anesthetic.

360
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:45,835
Wait, it won't hurt, will it?

361
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:47,545
I've never had an endoscopy.

362
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:48,789
Don't worry.

363
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,978
You'll fall asleep during the endoscopy
and it won't hurt at all.

364
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:58,226
But anesthetics don't work
very well on me.

365
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:06,288
They work very well on you.
Here you go.

366
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:07,734
Let's start.

367
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:10,791
Here we go.

368
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:17,055
Patient, let go of this.
Please, let go of it.

369
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:20,868
<i>Nothing ever lasts forever.</i>

370
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:24,689
<i>In the end, you changed.</i>

371
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,113
<i>There's no reason why.</i>

372
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:32,619
Hey, why aren't you singing?

373
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:33,959
Do it again.

374
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:36,231
<i>There's no reason why.</i>

375
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:41,179
<i>No reason why.</i>

376
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:43,430
<i>There's no sincerity.</i>

377
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,813
<i>No sincerity.</i>

378
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:48,500
Okay, that was very good.

379
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,861
I haven't seen someone
do this from the very start.

380
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:53,970
Why is everyone acting up today?

381
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,477
Patient, please let go of this.

382
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:58,715
We need to do the examination.

383
00:25:58,715 --> 00:26:01,439
What? I'm not giving it to you.

384
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:04,715
I'll give it to you
if you bring Doo Shik.

385
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,027
Doo Shik?

386
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:08,527
What "Doo Shik" are you talking about?
Is that your pet?

387
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:13,109
No! Doo Shik, Doo Shik.

388
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:18,560
My friend who's really cute and cool.

389
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:26,372
If you don't bring Doo Shik,
I will never open my mouth!

390
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:33,178
Is there a Bong Doo Shik here?

391
00:26:33,178 --> 00:26:35,807
Yes, I'm Bong Doo Shik.

392
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:43,576
Mister Bong Doo Shik?

393
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:46,499
Yes, I'm Bong Doo Shik.
Why did you ask for me?

394
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:50,797
- She wanted to tell you something.
- What?

395
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:54,653
She insisted she wouldn't do the
examination unless we called you over.

396
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:55,892
What?

397
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,073
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

398
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:01,592
It happens all the time.

399
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:05,195
Min Su Ah,
we brought Bong Doo Shik here for you.

400
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,851
Say what you need to.

401
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:11,949
You're here?

402
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:15,702
My friend, Doo Shik, is here?

403
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:19,525
Hey, what's with you?

404
00:27:19,525 --> 00:27:21,224
What are you doing?

405
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:25,988
I have something I want to tell you.

406
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:28,327
What is it? Hurry up and say it.

407
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:32,559
Doo Shik.

408
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,390
You know what?

409
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:42,700
I think that I must like you.

410
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,905
What... what?

411
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:50,920
Min Su Ah... likes Bong Doo Shik.

412
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,057
I really do.

413
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:58,664
What did you say?

414
00:27:58,664 --> 00:28:00,781
What kind of nonsense is that?

415
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:04,071
Wow, I've never seen someone
confess their feelings here before.

416
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:07,874
Endoscopy romance? That's new.

417
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:19,284
Oh, I'm sleepy.

418
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,592
Are you awake now?

419
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:23,500
Ah, yes.

420
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,344
Is the endoscopy over?

421
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:28,513
Am I very sick?

422
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:32,296
No, you just have some
inflammation in your stomach.

423
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:33,813
That's a relief.

424
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:40,732
But why are you laughing?

425
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:43,371
Did I fart during the examination?

426
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:46,063
No, that's not it.

427
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:49,337
You confessed to your friend
that you like him.

428
00:28:49,337 --> 00:28:51,530
What? I confessed to him?

429
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:54,076
To whom?

430
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:57,058
- Bong something...
- Oh!

431
00:28:57,576 --> 00:29:00,845
- Bong Doo Shik?
- That's right. Bong Doo Shik.

432
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:05,637
So, are you telling me that I confessed
my feelings to Bong Doo Shik?

433
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:07,211
How could that happen?

434
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:10,892
You said you wouldn't do the endoscopy
unless we brought him over.

435
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:13,019
Ah! What?

436
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:15,050
Seriously, that's crazy.

437
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,327
I'm crazy, I'm crazy.

438
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:28,499
So embarrassing.

439
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:33,294
How am I going to face
Bong Doo Shik again?

440
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,917
Hello?

441
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:07,583
Yes, that's me.

442
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:10,679
What?

443
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:19,023
Sorry for contacting you so suddenly.

444
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:22,847
It's fine.
What did you want to talk about?

445
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:29,365
I wanted to thank you for looking after
Yoon Ah and Sol all this time.

446
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:32,423
I don't think that's something
you should be thankful for.

447
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:36,816
Still, I wanted to say thank you.

448
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:38,247
Also...

449
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:41,502
here.

450
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,973
It's a token of my gratitude.

451
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,617
What? Gratitude?

452
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:54,511
Ah, are you telling me to
take this money and get lost?

453
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:56,894
You've seen way too many TV dramas.

454
00:30:56,894 --> 00:31:00,894
This is so much of a cliché
that they don't even use it in dramas.

455
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,952
Do you have that much money?

456
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:05,333
Let's see how much you put in there.

457
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,740
My goodness. Huh... huh?

458
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:18,028
What is this?

459
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:20,117
It's a letter.

460
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:24,685
I couldn't convey my gratitude
through only words.

461
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:28,648
Ah... I see.

462
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:31,048
Oh, I thought it was...

463
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:37,625
I will read the letter once I get home.

464
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:41,920
Also, I have a favor to ask.

465
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,656
I want to take responsibility
for Yoon Ah and Sol.

466
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:52,435
What did you say?

467
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:55,622
I still love Yoon Ah.

468
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,076
Love?

469
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,019
Then you should never have left her.

470
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,760
Do you even know how Yoon Ah
has been living all this time?

471
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,780
But what? You want to take
responsibility now?

472
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,159
I know I was a coward.

473
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:13,810
I know I don't deserve forgiveness.

474
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,482
I know it's too late.

475
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:20,212
But I want to repay my debt
to Yoon Ah and Sol.

476
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:25,420
So, can't you help me, Dong Gu?

477
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:32,531
You really have seen too many dramas.

478
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:36,351
Did you think if you did this,
I would say, "Oh, okay."

479
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:41,101
"Sol will be happier with her biological
dad rather than an unsuccessful person."

480
00:32:41,101 --> 00:32:45,260
"It's painful, but let them go."?
Did you think I'd do that?

481
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,816
Listen carefully.

482
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:49,442
Yoon Ah and Sol...

483
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:52,828
I will protect them
no matter what happens, so...

484
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,474
do not contact me again.

485
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,438
I will not give up... ever.

486
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:18,140
Min Su Ah... likes Bong Doo Shik.

487
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,655
I really do!

488
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:23,377
That makes no sense.

489
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:26,977
Su Ah likes me?

490
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:31,059
Oh... you're home?

491
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:35,070
Doo Shik, should we have a drink?

492
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,789
A drink? Why do you want to drink,
all of a sudden?

493
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:38,967
Just because.

494
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:41,776
I just feel like it.

495
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:44,580
Yeah?

496
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,009
Sure, I felt like drinking too.

497
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:53,384
Yeah, Joon Ki.

498
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:57,414
What? What are you talking about?

499
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:02,115
<i>You're here? Come in.</i>

500
00:34:11,086 --> 00:34:14,061
What is this place? Why are you here?

501
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:16,096
It worked out this way.

502
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,782
Why did you buy so much?

503
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:21,965
Oh, this? It's alcohol.

504
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:23,726
Dong Gu wanted to drink.

505
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:26,125
Oh, really? That worked out well.

506
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,425
I really wanted to drink too.

507
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:29,592
You too?

508
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:33,731
Then, it's been a while,
so should we all go for it?

509
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:35,141
Should we?

510
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:37,722
It's been a while, so let's go!

511
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:40,371
Let's go until we lose our minds!

512
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,692
Let's go!

513
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:44,822
Let's go until we become like snails.

514
00:34:44,822 --> 00:34:47,416
What are you doing? You do it too.

515
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,836
That is so immature.

516
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,737
Let's go! Let's drink up!

517
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:55,188
Let's go!

518
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:05,498
What's with you two?
Is something wrong?

519
00:35:05,498 --> 00:35:09,179
Girls, it's been a long time since
it was just the three of us.

520
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:11,307
Should we have a drink?

521
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:12,494
Should we?

522
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:16,333
I wish I could do that,
but my stomach is unwell.

523
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,572
I'll watch Sol and you two can drink.

524
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:21,304
Really?

525
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:24,476
Yoon Ah, then let's go for it.

526
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:25,818
Let's go!

527
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:28,275
Okay, let's go for it!

528
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:29,757
Sol, let's go!

529
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:31,092
Let's go!

530
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:35,405
What?

531
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:38,056
Seo Jin wants to break up?

532
00:35:38,056 --> 00:35:41,494
She says it's hard dating me.

533
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:44,675
I understand why Seo Jin feels that way.

534
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,996
So, I tried to make it right.

535
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:52,182
But I hesitated.

536
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:56,393
At first, I was just happy
to be this successful.

537
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:58,684
Now, I'm getting more ambitious.

538
00:35:58,684 --> 00:36:00,860
So, you're going to
break up with Seo Jin?

539
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,309
- Hm?
- Then on that day...

540
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:09,768
you will be smelling incense
at your own funeral.

541
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,949
No! Stop that.

542
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:14,670
I'm not breaking up with Seo Jin!

543
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,690
- Don't worry.
- Of course, you shouldn't.

544
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:22,905
Otherwise, both you and Seo Jin...

545
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:29,155
will be smelling incense
at your own funerals.

546
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:33,266
Cheers.

547
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:35,436
- Okay.
- Cheers.

548
00:36:35,436 --> 00:36:37,445
Cheers!

549
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:45,922
Hey, how long has it been since
the three of us have been together?

550
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:47,333
I know.

551
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:50,670
There are no guests and Sol's asleep.

552
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,041
It's good. Perfect for
the business to fall into ruin.

553
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:59,789
Still, it's nice and fun
to have just us girls here.

554
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,443
- Seo Jin.
- Yes?

555
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:05,298
There's something going on with
you and Joon Ki, right?

556
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:08,050
Did you two fight?

557
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:12,085
It's just kind of hard lately.

558
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:13,123
What is?

559
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:14,806
Just everything.

560
00:37:14,806 --> 00:37:20,563
I don't think Joon Ki likes me
as much as I like him.

561
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:24,340
I guess I feel like
I'm suffering all on my own.

562
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,590
Why? It seems like
Joon Ki likes you more to me.

563
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,150
Yeah.

564
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,110
I don't know.

565
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,800
How come I can't really tell?

566
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,525
I don't know.
I really don't know.

567
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,940
Drink up!

568
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:59,300
Hey, why are you sighing?

569
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,233
Just because.

570
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:03,780
I'm a little anxious.

571
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,445
About what?

572
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:08,610
Are you scared now
that Sol's dad has shown up?

573
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,960
You think Yoon Ah will go to him?

574
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,655
- You...
- Ouch.

575
00:38:16,014 --> 00:38:18,302
It's not like that.

576
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,485
He is Sol's biological father though.

577
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:24,994
He is successful.

578
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:29,726
On top of that,
I'm leaving the country in a few days.

579
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,498
I am a bit anxious.

580
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:33,507
You sure have a lot
to be anxious about, you punk.

581
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:39,525
Sol called him "Daddy" recently.

582
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:45,605
It felt like my heart
was dropping with a thud.

583
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:50,409
That's why I keep
feeling anxious and stuff.

584
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:54,827
It bothers me that I have to be
away for a month because of the movie.

585
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:57,673
Then why don't you just propose?

586
00:38:57,673 --> 00:38:59,204
Propose?

587
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:05,161
I don't have the money to do that.

588
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,300
Yoon Ah.

589
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,501
May I ask you something?

590
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,166
What is it?

591
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:26,577
Have you ever regretted
dating my brother?

592
00:39:28,806 --> 00:39:33,059
No, I've never regretted it once.

593
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:34,713
Really?

594
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:36,775
Yes.

595
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:42,715
Dong Gu isn't that successful
and he can be petty.

596
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,766
He gets angry easily.

597
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:47,744
He seems like a child.

598
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:52,626
But he loves me more than
anyone in this world.

599
00:39:53,485 --> 00:39:56,143
I know when I look into his eyes.

600
00:39:57,076 --> 00:40:01,954
Just how much he cherishes me
and loves me.

601
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:06,094
That's enough for me.

602
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:12,246
Oh, that's so cheesy.
I think I'm going to be sick.

603
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:16,025
So, you know when you look into his eyes?

604
00:40:16,025 --> 00:40:20,356
- Yes.
- Then how come I can't tell?

605
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:23,871
Love is so hard.

606
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:28,666
Love is always hard.

607
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:32,867
I really want to die lately, too.

608
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:37,456
Why? Do you also like someone?

609
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:40,516
- Who is it?
- Really?

610
00:40:40,516 --> 00:40:43,047
No. Don't worry about it.

611
00:40:51,894 --> 00:40:56,257
By the way,
do you like hide-and-seek?

612
00:40:58,452 --> 00:41:00,829
- Hide-and-seek?
- Yes.

613
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:04,001
I really like it a lot.

614
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:06,331
Do you want to play it?

615
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:12,253
Su Ah, you didn't drink today,
so you are "it."

616
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:14,864
I'm going! I'm going!

617
00:41:16,188 --> 00:41:19,003
What? What's wrong with Yoon Ah?

618
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:22,581
Do we really have to play hide-and-seek?

619
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:25,972
Oh, hey. Where are you going?

620
00:41:25,972 --> 00:41:30,693
You're "it." I have to go hide.

621
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:35,523
- What?
- Count to 10 before looking.

622
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:37,309
Okay?

623
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:40,193
Are they serious?

624
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:42,262
<i>Su Ah!</i>

625
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:43,949
<i>I'm hiding.</i>

626
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:47,496
<i>I'm not hiding in the laundry room.</i>

627
00:41:47,496 --> 00:41:51,045
<i>So, you really can't come in here.</i>

628
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:53,576
What's wrong with everyone?

629
00:41:53,576 --> 00:41:56,655
Do I really have to go look for them?

630
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:59,101
This is crazy.

631
00:42:07,498 --> 00:42:13,523
Both you and I
lead such exhausting lives.

632
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:15,536
Don't you think?

633
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,577
You're right.

634
00:42:21,563 --> 00:42:23,831
Hey, why are you laughing?

635
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:26,213
It's funny.

636
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:29,592
You two are both
being really materialistic.

637
00:42:29,592 --> 00:42:32,442
When did you two become so materialistic?

638
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:35,398
It's so pathetic and cowardly.

639
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:37,898
- What?
- You know how it is.

640
00:42:37,898 --> 00:42:41,954
Hey, since when did we fall in love
based on success?

641
00:42:41,954 --> 00:42:46,103
You're worried about his success
and his money.

642
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:51,152
Hey! What do love and a person's
success have to do with anything?

643
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,244
- You too, Joon Ki.
- Hm?

644
00:42:53,244 --> 00:42:56,735
Are you Kim Soo Hyun,
Gong Yoo, or what?

645
00:42:56,735 --> 00:42:59,733
You have nothing to lose,
yet you're so scared.

646
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:02,375
You wanted to succeed on your own
and didn't get your dad's help.

647
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,887
It was all bullcrap.

648
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:09,186
Maybe not.

649
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,385
Is living like this normal?

650
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,396
It's a little lonely, though.

651
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:19,996
I didn't think we would change.

652
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:24,329
I knew we were sort of losers.

653
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:27,646
I thought we were living life
in a cool way too.

654
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,385
You're right.

655
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:33,297
How did I become such a coward?

656
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:36,255
It would be a relief to be a coward.

657
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:41,521
I became the most
pathetic loser in the world.

658
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,789
Oh yeah.

659
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,625
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Hey.

660
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:49,677
Should I tell you some big news?

661
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:53,871
Well, apparently Su Ah...

662
00:43:54,452 --> 00:43:56,846
likes me.

663
00:43:58,543 --> 00:44:00,086
What?

664
00:44:00,086 --> 00:44:02,193
Su Ah likes... you?

665
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:03,610
You're surprised, right?

666
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,882
I was really shocked too.

667
00:44:05,882 --> 00:44:08,942
Yeah, but that's not right.

668
00:44:08,942 --> 00:44:12,204
Yeah, that's really not right.

669
00:44:12,204 --> 00:44:14,023
Wait.

670
00:44:14,023 --> 00:44:16,885
Why can't it be right?

671
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:19,990
Su Ah is a good person.

672
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,610
- She's cool and pretty.
- Geez.

673
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,954
She's very naive and innocent.

674
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:31,750
Joon Ki, you're dating Dong Gu's sister,
so who are you to say anything?

675
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,469
Hey, you punk. It's not the same.

676
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:38,753
Yeah, you punk. It's just not right.

677
00:44:38,753 --> 00:44:41,715
- You punk.
- You punk.

678
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:43,925
Why isn't it right?

679
00:44:58,983 --> 00:45:01,873
<i>- What's with the mustache?
- It's a lucky charm.</i>

680
00:45:02,663 --> 00:45:07,074
Even if I'm not there,
look at this and just know I'm with you.

681
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:08,364
Okay?

682
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:12,952
<i>You know that
I'm your number one fan, right?</i>

683
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:17,501
Don't forget that
I'm always cheering you on

684
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,967
Good luck, Joon Ki.

685
00:45:29,914 --> 00:45:33,277
<i>Joon Ki, am I not a woman to you?</i>

686
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:35,760
<i>I see you as a man.</i>

687
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,315
I think I like you.

688
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:41,240
Let's start things as a man and woman.

689
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,105
Joon Ki!

690
00:45:48,505 --> 00:45:50,322
Let's go for it.

691
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:54,422
You've suffered a long time and
things are finally going your way.

692
00:45:54,422 --> 00:45:56,780
I don't want to get in the way of that.

693
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:09,110
Joon Ki, where are you going?

694
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:12,018
To see my fan.

695
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:14,907
What are you talking about?
What about meeting the chairman?

696
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:18,047
It doesn't matter.
Tell him to get rid of our contract.

697
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:20,250
Why are you suddenly doing this?

698
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:27,217
I just want to live like I always have,
immaturely and without plans.

699
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,702
And not cowardly.

700
00:46:32,795 --> 00:46:35,237
Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

701
00:46:41,396 --> 00:46:42,932
Oh, that startled me.

702
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:45,641
What was that sound?

703
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:48,190
Oh, what is that smell?

704
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,918
Who farted? Who was it?

705
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:55,766
What? No one is here?

706
00:46:58,085 --> 00:46:59,681
Did I fart?

707
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:02,382
Oh, it smells.

708
00:47:07,264 --> 00:47:12,086
I played hide-and-seek all night.
Now, my whole body hurts.

709
00:47:12,885 --> 00:47:14,762
My head hurts.

710
00:47:16,103 --> 00:47:18,193
Oh, my head. Ah...

711
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:20,742
It hurts so much. My stomach too.

712
00:47:20,742 --> 00:47:22,652
Oh my.

713
00:47:22,652 --> 00:47:24,693
What is this?

714
00:47:24,693 --> 00:47:26,514
Why is she sleeping here?

715
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:33,585
How awkward.
I'd better go sleep in my room.

716
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:43,804
That would have hurt a lot.

717
00:47:43,804 --> 00:47:46,217
She must be in a deep sleep.

718
00:47:51,498 --> 00:47:53,670
Gosh, where is it?

719
00:47:57,266 --> 00:47:59,407
Got it, got it, got it...

720
00:48:02,474 --> 00:48:06,335
Su Ah, if you could move
just a little bit more...

721
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:12,547
Ow, that hurt. That hurt.

722
00:48:12,547 --> 00:48:15,186
Su Ah, are you okay?

723
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:18,545
Yeah. I'm okay.

724
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:20,086
When did you get here?

725
00:48:20,086 --> 00:48:22,833
Oh, I just got here.

726
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,411
Ah, I see.

727
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:29,246
I was in such a deep sleep.

728
00:48:29,246 --> 00:48:31,954
I had no idea that you were home.

729
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:34,666
Yeah, that's what I thought.

730
00:48:35,885 --> 00:48:38,423
Aren't you going to pick up your phone?

731
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:41,612
Yes, I'm going to. I will.

732
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,916
Hello? Yes, Joon Ki.

733
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,255
What? Now?

734
00:48:50,255 --> 00:48:53,432
Yeah. Okay, I got it. Yeah.

735
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,927
Su Ah.

736
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,481
Can you help me?

737
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,302
- Su Ah, what are you doing here?
- Huh?

738
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:21,106
I came out for a drive and I saw you.

739
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:23,543
Get in if you're going to work.
I'll give you a ride.

740
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,606
No, I can take the subway.

741
00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:29,382
Just get in. Hurry up and get in.

742
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:32,208
- I'm really okay.
- Get in.

743
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,565
Oh, Doo Shik. You're here too?

744
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:49,954
Seo Jin, take this.

745
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:52,293
No, I don't want it.

746
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:54,565
I want it.
Seo Jin, can you get it from him?

747
00:49:54,565 --> 00:49:57,552
What? You know this door doesn't
open and the window's broken?

748
00:49:57,552 --> 00:50:00,472
Just get it from him.
The window opens a little.

749
00:50:00,472 --> 00:50:02,650
Yeah, it's really good.

750
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,320
Geez, seriously.

751
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:08,242
Give it to me.

752
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:12,612
- What are you doing?
- Put the window up!

753
00:50:15,434 --> 00:50:18,458
I'm stuck again.
I told you this would happen!

754
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:20,721
- Success.
- Okay.

755
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,425
What do you mean by success?

756
00:50:24,425 --> 00:50:27,498
- What are you doing? Step on it!
- Okay.

757
00:50:30,474 --> 00:50:33,255
What are you doing? Where are we going?

758
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:36,126
Joon Ki told us to kidnap you,
so stay calm.

759
00:50:36,126 --> 00:50:38,619
What? You people!

760
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,760
- I want to get out.
- Hey, stay put.

761
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,802
- Stop the car!
- Don't do that.

762
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:46,826
- That's dangerous!
- Stop!

763
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:49,451
I can't drive. Just stay put!

764
00:51:00,697 --> 00:51:02,132
Excuse me.

765
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,411
What are you doing?

766
00:51:05,411 --> 00:51:06,672
Hey.

767
00:51:12,585 --> 00:51:13,956
Yoon Ah.

768
00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:16,570
What are you doing here?

769
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,726
I came to return what you gave us.

770
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:23,597
Yoon Ah, that's just--

771
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:24,847
I know how you feel.

772
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:29,807
I also know that you are
sincerely sorry to me and Sol.

773
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:36,603
However, no matter what you do,
I won't change my mind.

774
00:51:36,603 --> 00:51:39,079
I really love Dong Gu.

775
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:43,628
I went through a lot because of the
hard times I went through back then.

776
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:47,186
He helped me leave that behind.

777
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:51,170
So, I don't even resent you.
I mean that.

778
00:51:51,744 --> 00:51:56,244
Because Sol and I met Dong Gu...

779
00:51:57,273 --> 00:52:01,682
No, because we met our family...

780
00:52:03,344 --> 00:52:05,543
we are really happy.

781
00:52:07,153 --> 00:52:12,034
So, let's just move on and
keep the good memories we had.

782
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:14,460
But, if you keep this up...

783
00:52:14,985 --> 00:52:18,380
I think that even our good memories
will be destroyed.

784
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,907
That would be so sad.

785
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:27,300
I'll be going now then.

786
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,317
Ah...

787
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:35,670
If you want to see Sol,
call me whenever you want.

788
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,679
Make sure you're not
forgetting to pack anything.

789
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:53,934
Don't get to Dubai and say you don't
have something or forgot it, okay?

790
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:55,456
Yes.

791
00:52:55,456 --> 00:52:58,126
Dong Gu, can you get me
the location schedule?

792
00:52:58,126 --> 00:52:59,543
Yes, Director.

793
00:53:03,536 --> 00:53:05,545
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

- Sol's 100th day party.

800
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:44,925
Thank you, everyone.

801
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:18,972
I like you.

I really like you, Yoon Ah.

803
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,753
I really like you, Dong Gu.

It's time. Why isn't he here?

810

Who are all of these people?

812
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:53,172

818
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:13,920
What is this?

819

Cindy announces marriage
and is three months pregnant?

820
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:20,134
It says Cindy is marrying actor
Lee Min Suk.

821
00:56:20,134 --> 00:56:22,014
It's a rushed marriage.

822
00:56:22,951 --> 00:56:25,023
Ah, I knew it.

823
00:56:25,023 --> 00:56:28,525

Yeah, he told us to bring Seo Jin,
no matter what.

836

But I know now.

The most important thing
in the world to me...

- See what?
- Someone said this to me.

00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:26,855
You can see how much they love and
cherish you when you look in their eyes.

Now, when I look into yours...

861

Really?

863
00:58:35,764 --> 00:58:39,619
But you only see it a little bit?

864
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,264
That can't be right.

865
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:44,673
Look, look, look.
There should be a lot. Look.

00:58:44,673 --> 00:58:46,635
- Take a look.
- That's gross. Stop.

Just take a look.

868
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,795
See how much I love and cherish you.

869
00:58:49,795 --> 00:58:50,813
Take a look.

870
00:58:50,813 --> 00:58:53,233
You can't hold back
and you're joking around again?

871
00:59:10,954 --> 00:59:12,797
They look good.

872
00:59:12,797 --> 00:59:14,496
They really do.

873
00:59:14,496 --> 00:59:18,378
They like each other that much,
so why fight at all?

874
00:59:19,244 --> 00:59:22,226
Then should we really
go to that restaurant today?

875
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:25,215
- Yes.
- Let's go. My treat.

876
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:31,485
Oh, I'm hungry too.

877
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,677
Su Ah, aren't you hungry?

878
00:59:34,677 --> 00:59:36,735
Yes, a little.

879
00:59:36,735 --> 00:59:42,166
Yeah? Then should we
go somewhere nice and eat?

880
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:46,878
Huh? You and me,
just the two of us?

881
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:48,286
What?

882
00:59:48,286 --> 00:59:52,429
Is there a reason that two friends
can't eat together in a nice place?

883
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:55,833
Not at all.

884
00:59:57,246 --> 01:00:01,931
So, where is this nice place?

885
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,945
I don't know.
Let's go out and find one.

886
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,978
- Let's go.
- Okay.

887
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:33,313
Hm, why isn't anyone here?

888
01:00:33,313 --> 01:00:34,704
How strange.

889
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:45,125
Hello? This is Waikiki Guest House.

890
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,226
Yes.

891
01:00:47,605 --> 01:00:50,378
What? Dong Gu?

892
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:53,170
Yes, okay. Yes.

893

894
01:01:11,628 --> 01:01:14,579
Dong Gu, what is all of this?

895
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,655
What are you doing right now?

896
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,699
Yoon Ah.

897
01:01:35,347 --> 01:01:38,708
Yoon Ah, will you marry me?

898
01:01:39,547 --> 01:01:42,713
I'll make you and Sol happy forever.

899
01:01:44,255 --> 01:01:46,393
Marry me, Yoon Ah.

900
01:01:53,581 --> 01:01:55,173
I don't want to.

901
01:01:56,237 --> 01:02:00,184
What? Uh... why not?

902
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:03,590
Ah, is it because I spoke informally?
I'll do it again then.

903
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:05,581
Yoon Ah.

904
01:02:05,581 --> 01:02:07,416
Will you please marry me?

905
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:10,432
I don't want to.

906
01:02:16,681 --> 01:02:18,567
Well, why not?

907
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:20,978
We can talk about that later.

908
01:02:20,978 --> 01:02:23,288
Dong Gu, what happened with your movie?

909
01:02:23,288 --> 01:02:25,521
The director just called.

910
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:27,768
Ah...

911
01:02:29,688 --> 01:02:32,206
I just decided not to go to Dubai.

912
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:36,148
Thinking of leaving you and Sol,
I just couldn't go.

913
01:02:36,148 --> 01:02:37,838
Why?

914
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,208
Is it because of Sol's dad?

915
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:43,965
No, it's not that.

916
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:49,507
This man takes so much work.

917
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:50,588
What?

918
01:02:52,057 --> 01:02:53,813
Hey, Kang Dong Gu.

919
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:58,228
Are you that worried?

920
01:02:58,228 --> 01:03:00,268
What has you so worried?

921
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:03,960
I'm not worried at all,
so why are you so worried?

922
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,913
Dong Gu, you're a real coward.

923
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:08,833
What did I do?

924
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:13,293
Did you think I would be touched
if you did this?

925
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:16,161
You're giving up on something
you've always wanted to do?

926
01:03:16,161 --> 01:03:19,072
Because of me, at that?

927
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:22,623
- Do you not trust me at all?
- No..

928
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,324
It's not that.

929
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:32,351
Dong Gu, don't worry about a thing.

930
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,226
You should go.

931
01:03:35,275 --> 01:03:37,724
I will always be here.

932
01:03:38,757 --> 01:03:43,371
I will be by Kang Dong Gu's side forever.

933
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:54,186
Forever?

934
01:04:38,764 --> 01:04:40,315
I'll get going now.

935
01:04:40,315 --> 01:04:42,324
- Bye.
- Have a nice trip.

936
01:04:43,878 --> 01:04:46,858
Don't fight and break up
just because I'm not around.

937
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:48,217
All right.

938
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,889
Joon Ki, be good to my sister.

939
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:51,599
You know what will happen if you aren't.

940
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,427
I know, I know.

941
01:04:53,427 --> 01:04:57,248
I'll be smelling incense
at my own funeral.

942
01:04:57,248 --> 01:05:01,831
I'll treat Seo Jin like a princess
just so I don't have to hear that.

943
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:03,588
Okay. That's good.

944
01:05:03,588 --> 01:05:05,628
Su Ah, do well with your mall.

945
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:08,108
Stop picking on Doo Shik, okay?

946
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:10,248
When did I pick on Doo Shik?

947
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:12,161
- I don't do that anymore.
- Yeah.

948
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:13,711
- I wonder why.
- Hm.

949
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:17,338
I wonder why she doesn't pick on him.
I'm very curious.

950
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,235
What? Shut up.

951
01:05:20,235 --> 01:05:22,369
Go. Go to Dubai.

952
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:24,726
You too, Doo Shik. Don't just date.

953
01:05:24,726 --> 01:05:26,909
Work on your script too, okay?

954
01:05:26,909 --> 01:05:29,458
Date? When did I do that?

955
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:32,190
Anyway, finish it before I get back.

956
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:33,759
I'm going to check on you.

957
01:05:33,759 --> 01:05:36,717
Okay, stop lecturing me.

958
01:05:37,778 --> 01:05:40,378
Yoon Ah, I'll be going now.

959
01:05:40,378 --> 01:05:43,458
Okay, have a safe trip, Dong Gu.

960
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:45,001
Okay.

961
01:05:45,001 --> 01:05:48,367
Even if I'm not here,
eat and sleep well.

962
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:51,628
Have a healthy digestive system
whether it's number one or two.

963
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:53,358
Don't even look at other men.

964
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,746
Oh! All right, all right.
Stop that and get going.

965
01:05:56,746 --> 01:06:00,264
Okay, but I should say bye to Sol.

966
01:06:01,431 --> 01:06:05,280
Sol, you can't forget my face.

967
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,641
Don't get sick and stay healthy.

968
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:10,679
I'll be back soon, all right?

969
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:14,164
- I'm really going.
- Okay.

970
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:17,753
Sol, I'll be going now, okay?

971
01:06:19,978 --> 01:06:21,740
Daddy.

972
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,311
What?

973
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:33,574
Sol, what did you just say?

974
01:06:34,097 --> 01:06:35,650
Daddy.

975
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,273
Oh... did you hear that?

976
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:40,755
Did you hear that?

977
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:43,335
Did you hear her call me Daddy?

978
01:06:43,335 --> 01:06:45,088
We heard it. We heard it.

979
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:47,356
- Are you that happy?
- Of course.

980
01:06:47,356 --> 01:06:48,846
Sol, do it once more.

981
01:06:48,846 --> 01:06:51,445
Huh? Say "daddy." Try it.

982
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:55,561
Why are you being like that?
You play hard to get.

983
01:06:55,561 --> 01:06:58,492
Just once, please. Just once more.

984
01:06:58,492 --> 01:07:01,416
That's enough, Dong Gu.
You'll miss your flight.

985
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:04,563
Now that Sol called me her daddy,
I really don't want to go.

986
01:07:04,563 --> 01:07:07,211
Yoon Ah, should I stay?

987
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:08,630
There you go again.

988
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,108
Get going now.

989
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:11,510
All right.

990
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,719
- I'll really go now.
- Okay.

01:07:18,063 --> 01:07:19,445
Sol.

992
01:07:22,065 --> 01:07:23,871
Daddy's going now.

993
01:07:28,331 --> 01:07:30,759
- Bye.
- Have a good trip.

994
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,067
Bye.

01:07:32,067 --> 01:07:33,672

1001
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:05,273
You have found out where I am.

1002
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,807
Perhaps because you are president,
you are very quick.

1003
01:08:09,807 --> 01:08:11,487
Shut up!

1004
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,349
Let the people of my country go,
you alien.

1005
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:18,332
It's unexpected to find a president
who cares so much about his people.

1006
01:08:18,332 --> 01:08:19,766
However, it's too late.

1007

Also, are you even going to
release this if we film it?

How can there be fewer
crew members than the actors?

01:09:28,155 --> 01:09:30,907
Do you think lots of crew members
means it's a good movie?
