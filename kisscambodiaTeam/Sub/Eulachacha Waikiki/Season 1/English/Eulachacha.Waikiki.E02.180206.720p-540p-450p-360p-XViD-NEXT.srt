1
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:12,840
Don't worry I'm fine

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:14,550
Don't feel pressured

3
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:18,020
I don't have a boyfriend either

4
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:21,790
But why aren't you say anything?

5
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,490
You are too much of an idealist

6
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:26,220
There's no such girls

7
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:29,760
Who will talk to you first

8
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,330
Just by looking at your eyes

9
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:33,060
You are one of those guys

10
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:35,270
Like now

11
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,680
Gosh, it hurts.

12
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:50,950
Are you happy?

13
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:53,520
Did you sleep well, Sol?

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,550
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

15
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,720
- You're up early. - Good morning, Yoon Ah.

16
00:00:57,727 --> 00:00:59,090
Good...

17
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:02,300
Don't be surprised. He does that every day.

18
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:03,930
What's that called?

19
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:07,570
- Gr... - Grooming, you idiot.

20
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,570
Guys should try to look good too these days.

21
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:13,780
Yoon Ah, I'm actually an actor.

22
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:15,010
An actor.

23
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:17,810
You're an actor? That's so cool.

24
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:19,880
You call yourself an actor?

25
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:22,980
You always stand in the back without a single lime.

26
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:27,020
That's so kind of you, Writer Bong.

27
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:28,420
Are you a writer?

28
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:30,130
What kind of stuff do you write?

29
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:32,690
I write novels.

30
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:34,360
I also write a novel that gets published online.

31
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:36,560
But my ultimate goal is to write scripts.

32
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,100
Dream on.

33
00:01:38,168 --> 00:01:41,140
All you ever do is write resumes for other people.

34
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:44,140
He even wrote a speech...

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,940
for a kid for a bag of chips once.

36
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:49,640
What kind of writer...

37
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:52,340
- works with such trivial things? - Are you done?

38
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,580
- You're no writer. - Stop it.

39
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:57,720
You two are just the same.

40
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:59,780
We're at least better than you.

41
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,320
You set the movie set on fire...

42
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:04,290
while trying to roast sweet potatoes and got kicked out.

43
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:06,730
Why do you bring that up now?

44
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:08,630
Also, it was potatoes, not sweet potatoes.

45
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:11,230
It doesn't change the fact that you started a fire.

46
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:12,630
They're different.

47
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,500
Sweet potatoes is 2 words while potatoes is 1 word.

48
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:17,870
The number of words doesn't matter. I'm talking about a fire.

49
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:19,070
Sweet potatoes and potatoes are different.

50
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:21,810
Why do you have to get on my nerves from the morning?

51
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:24,280
What's wrong? Please calm down.

52
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:26,680
Why would you tell everyone?

53
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:29,210
- I'm taking your side right now. - What are you talking about?

54
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,450
Be quiet!

55
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,680
You guys are so childish.

56
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:33,790
Please be understanding.

57
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,290
The men in this house are a bit weird.

58
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:38,990
What? Weird?

59
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:42,060
You're the weirdest one here, Chewbacca.

60
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,160
Chewbacca? What's that?

61
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,600
Don't you know the furry animal in "Star Wars"...

62
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:48,940
Just a second. Here it is.

63
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,040
Chewbacca.

64
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:54,170
Why do you call her "Chewbacca"?

65
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:56,470
Both Seo Jin and Chewbacca...

66
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,240
Don't you dare tell her.

67
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,780
I won't.

68
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:03,450
Chewbacca!

69
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,080
Chewbacca!

70
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,090
Are you serious? Stop it.

71
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:10,590
- Hey. - Calm down.

72
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:12,460
You brat.

73
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:14,230
- I hate both of you. - Come on.

74
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:16,430
They're so weird.

75
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:21,000
Was it a good idea to stay here?

76
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:23,200
Will you stop?

77
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,700
Sol, are you hungry?

78
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,180
Do you want to eat?

79
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,340
Sol, I'll give you some milk.

80
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:31,150
Are you hungry?

81
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:33,280
It's time for milk.

82
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,220
Gosh.

83
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,520
- She's the weirdest one. - You're right.

84
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,020
What's with her?

85
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:42,390
(Anyone Can Become A Wolverine)

86
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:49,230
Should we start cleaning?

87
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes. Seo Jin will come and take a look soon.

88
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,300
Let's start before we get in trouble.

89
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:59,910
But I'm not sure if it's necessary that all three of us clean.

90
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:01,710
So...

91
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,310
why don't we make a bet?

92
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,080
What kind of bet?

93
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:14,590
Are you saying you can put on the pants without using hands?

94
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,920
That's absurd.

95
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,260
- It's impossible. - I know.

96
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:23,630
If I fail, I'll clean the whole place alone.

97
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,500
If I succeed, I don't have to clean.

98
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,270
Deal?

99
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:29,570
- Deal. - Deal.

100
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:40,910
Here we go.

101
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,080
You have 30 seconds.

102
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,490
It's not going to work.

103
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,290
Wait.

104
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,160
Hold on.

105
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,000
What's happening?

106
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,000
- What are you doing? - Is this really possible?

107
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:02,570
What's going on?

108
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,940
What is this?

109
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,440
What are you doing?

110
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:10,580
I told you to clean the place. What are you up to now?

111
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,210
- I was about to start. - So was I.

112
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,180
Guys!

113
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,550
I succeeded. I don't have to clean.

114
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:19,650
Don't have to clean, my foot.

115
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:21,550
- Follow me. - I don't have to clean.

116
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:24,090
I succeeded. I don't have to.

117
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,630
Gosh, I'm tired.

118
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,530
With more guests, we have more cleaning to do.

119
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:35,870
Goodness, it wasn't that much. Stop complaining.

120
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:37,900
Hurry up.

121
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,570
It's almost time for the customers to check-in.

122
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:40,570
Fine.

123
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:42,510
Aren't you going to the library today?

124
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:44,680
- Do you want to slack off? - No.

125
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:48,250
You're graduating soon. How is the job hunt going?

126
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,820
Well... I wish it was going well.

127
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:53,790
I'm doing my best, but it's not easy.

128
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,620
It's hard for everyone these days.

129
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,430
Cheer up.

130
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,490
You're such a big help though.

131
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,030
Don't say that.

132
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:04,160
To think that I might end up like you if I slack off,

133
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,830
encourages me to push forward.

134
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,140
Thanks.

135
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,040
Gosh.

136
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:15,740
What are you doing?

137
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:17,710
Are you going to vacuum all day?

138
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,750
Gather and wash all the sheets, and clean the rooftop too.

139
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,620
Also, put away the Christmas tree.

140
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:26,220
- Christmas was months ago. - Fine. Stop nagging.

141
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:28,290
I'm already depressed.

142
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:29,690
Why are you depressed?

143
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:32,060
- Soo Ah and I broke up. - I know.

144
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:35,460
In addition to getting dumped, you got caught while selling your ring.

145
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:38,360
But you're still not over her and can't stop bothering her.

146
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:39,800
- Who said that? - Jun Ki.

147
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,530
He has such a big mouth.

148
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:44,370
Once a girl turns her back, it's over. Get over her.

149
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:46,300
We were together for four years.

150
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:47,810
We can't break up this easily.

151
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,940
I can't accept it.

152
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:51,640
- Then talk to her. - She won't let me see her.

153
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:52,940
She ignores my calls and texts.

154
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,550
She avoids me even if I come to see her.

155
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,780
She must be determined.

156
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,250
How can she do this to me?

157
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:01,690
Do you think I'm unreliable...

158
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,220
and have no future?

159
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:06,290
What? Oh, I'm late.

160
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:08,860
- For what? - I have to go to the library. Bye.

161
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,000
Gosh.

162
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:15,270
Even my only sister looks down on me.

163
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:19,170
I'm exhausted.

164
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,640
I might die from working too hard.

165
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,640
You must be tired. Do you want something to drink?

166
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,080
- Sure. - I'm okay.

167
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,950
- Stop putting on makeup. - Hey.

168
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:33,280
T-zone becomes oily fast. It needs touch-ups.

169
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,120
Also, I have a movie shoot today.

170
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,320
What movie is it?

171
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,560
You know the movie, "X-Men", right?

172
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,060
This is like the Korean version of that movie.

173
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:43,630
It's about a fight between humans and mutants.

174
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:44,930
Who plays the main character?

175
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:47,030
Zo In Sung.

176
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:50,800
It's going to be a hit.

177
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,440
Then what happens?

178
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:54,370
I'll be a star.

179
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:55,840
And then?

180
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:59,780
I won't have to see these gloomy faces anymore.

181
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:02,120
The star will get going now.

182
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,120
See you.

183
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,350
See you.

184
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,390
Gosh.

185
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,330
Are you okay? Aren't you hurt?

186
00:08:11,494 --> 00:08:13,060
I'm okay.

187
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:15,930
Be more careful.

188
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:17,170
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:24,510
Look. I haven't given you my permission to stay here yet.

190
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,940
If you don't become much help,

191
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:28,940
I'll send you away.

192
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,780
Don't worry. I'll work hard.

193
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:47,060
Go to your baby. I'll clean up here.

194
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,900
Give me the gloves before you go.

196
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:52,330
Right.

197
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:02,240
Oh, no. My goodness.

198
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:05,110
- I'm sorry. - The soap!

199
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:09,480
From the morning...

200
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:13,420
- I'm sorry. - Stop apologizing, and just go.

201
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm so...

202
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,160
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,730
Gosh.

204
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,960
I don't like her. I really don't like her.

205
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,200
Her baby distracted her.

206
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:29,470
You've been on edge lately.

207
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:31,670
Is it about Soo Ah?

208
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,740
- No, it's not. - It is.

209
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:38,080
- It's written all over your face. - No!

210
00:09:38,214 --> 00:09:39,340
I said no!

211
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:42,880
Why don't you listen to me? Gosh, you're so annoying.

212
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,550
You clean up here.

213
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:47,590
Gosh, this is annoying.

214
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,220
Why does he always take it out on me?

215
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:51,460
I can hear you!

216
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:56,090
Director.

217
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:58,900
- Is everything ready? - Yes, almost.

218
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,300
Radioactive mutant!

219
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:14,550
Where are you?

220
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:19,490
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

221
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,790
I love your makeup. It looks perfect.

222
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:25,890
We'll start as soon as In Sung comes. Be on standby.

223
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:27,090
Okay.

224
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:29,100
Where's the genetic mutant?

225
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:31,000
Genetic mutant!

226
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:32,730
Hello.

227
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,840
What? Really?

228
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,240
We're in trouble.

229
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:38,670
I got it.

230
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,170
- My goodness. - What's wrong?

231
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:43,040
In Sung got into a car accident on his way here.

232
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:44,880
He's in the hospital.

233
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,140
What about the shoot?

234
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,380
Isn't it obvious?

235
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:50,280
We can't shoot without the main actor.

236
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:52,750
Assistant Director?

237
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,020
What should I do?

238
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,620
Remove the makeup for now. Tomorrow...

239
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,820
What? He can't remove it.

240
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:00,120
It costs a lot.

241
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,760
Keep the makeup...

242
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,460
and come back tomorrow. Got it?

243
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,200
Do I stay like this?

244
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:09,200
If you mess up the makeup,

245
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:11,940
I'll get rid of your role, okay?

246
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:14,510
- I... - Darn it.

247
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,310
Get rid of my role?

248
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,010
The shoot is canceled today.

249
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:21,380
What? Where is everyone going?

250
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:24,380
How can I keep this makeup on?

251
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:25,720
Wait.

252
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:33,690
Hello.

253
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:42,830
What's going on?

254
00:11:42,838 --> 00:11:44,000
What is that?

255
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,810
- Gosh. - Who is he?

256
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:53,010
This is embarrassing.

257
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,250
Why is there so many people?

258
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:04,460
I can't mess up the makeup.

259
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:06,590
What's going on?

260
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,350
Excuse me.

261
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,990
You should be more careful.

262
00:12:40,496 --> 00:12:41,930
- Hi. - Hi.

263
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:46,070
Gosh.

264
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,600
I told her to clean up the towels, but she left them here.

265
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:51,100
Can't she do anything right?

266
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:52,310
Goodness.

267
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:54,640
- Dong Gu. - Yes?

268
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:57,410
Gosh, what are you?

269
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,310
It's me.

270
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,080
Jun Ki? Why do you look like that?

271
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:05,020
The shoot was canceled because the main actor got into an accident.

272
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:07,020
The director told him...

273
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:09,620
to keep the makeup for tomorrow to save the cost.

274
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:13,090
You live such a hard life.

275
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,460
That's enough.

276
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,930
I'm already embarrassed.

277
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:28,110
Can you put the phone on my ear?

278
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:32,850
Hello? This is Lee Jun Ki.

279
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:35,750
What, the police?

280
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:39,380
We caught a pickpocket and found your wallet on him.

281
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:41,520
My wallet? Hold on, please.

282
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,560
What? Who stole my wallet?

283
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:49,330
Yes, I'll be right there.

284
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,430
- Hang up. - Wait.

285
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,560
Are you going like that?

286
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:55,130
What else can I do? My ID, credit card, and money...

287
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:56,370
There's no money.

288
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,770
That jerk. You're done for.

289
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,910
Gosh, there's no one normal around here.

290
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:07,110
What's going on?

291
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:09,550
Who left the refrigerator door open?

292
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:14,960
What if everything spoils?

293
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,460
Is she the one who did it?

294
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:21,830
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah!

295
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,960
Yes, did you call me?

296
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,100
Did you...

297
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:28,830
do this?

298
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:31,440
I was cleaning the fridge when I heard her cry.

299
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:33,940
- I'll clean up now. - Forget it.

300
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,310
Take care of Sol first.

301
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:40,410
What are these? Did mushrooms grow on mushrooms?

302
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,850
- Please throw these away. - Okay.

303
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:45,250
Did you eat well? Sol.

304
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:47,750
- Let's sleep. - Please do a better job.

305
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:50,020
- I'm sorry. - If you're really sorry,

306
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:52,690
don't cause trouble again.

307
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:54,130
What's wrong? What happened?

308
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,100
This is all your fault.

309
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:59,300
You and Jun Ki. What kind of place is this?

310
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:01,070
I'm the bad guy.

311
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,930
Why is he taking it out on me?

312
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:05,340
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

313
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:06,540
It's okay.

314
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:09,070
I'll take Sol.

315
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:11,710
I'll take care of her. You should clean up first.

316
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,710
I still feel terrible.

317
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:14,750
It's okay.

318
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:16,820
I don't have much to do before work.

319
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,920
Besides Sol likes me very much.

320
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:22,890
Right, Sol?

321
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:32,830
You like me so much that you barfed on me.

322
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:44,740
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

323
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:46,680
Be nice and let me go.

324
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,950
Do you want to get hit, you punk?

325
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,580
Excuse me.

326
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:52,850
How can I help you?

327
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:55,890
What's this?

328
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,390
Who are you?

329
00:15:57,393 --> 00:15:59,490
I came after a call.

330
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:01,930
I'm Lee Jun Ki. I heard that my wallet is here.

331
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:03,760
Please move the gun away.

332
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:07,500
Are you the victim whom I spoke with?

333
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:09,430
- Yes. - You startled me.

334
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:11,210
What's wrong with your face?

335
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:16,240
I'm an actor, but the shoot was postponed.

336
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:18,910
You told me that my wallet is here. Where is it?

337
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:20,680
- There it is. - Wait, sir.

338
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:22,380
Let me check your identification.

339
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:23,880
Let's see.

340
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:25,720
"Lee Jun Ki".

341
00:16:28,357 --> 00:16:29,890
Are you Lee Jun Ki?

342
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,890
Yes, that's me. Take a look.

343
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:35,260
You look like your picture, but I can't be sure.

344
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:38,430
Take a close look. It's me. I look the same.

345
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:41,730
I can't verify because of the makeup. Can you remove it?

346
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:44,100
No, if I mess it up, I'll lose my role.

347
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,040
Let's check the fingerprint. Give me your finger.

348
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,210
Fingerprint?

349
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,610
Can I pull out the hair?

350
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:56,110
No, if you mess it up, I'll lose my role.

351
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:57,920
What else can I do?

352
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,650
Can I get a DNA test? You can draw my blood.

353
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:03,620
Run a DNA test to identify you?

354
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:06,120
We have to send your blood and hair to National Forensic Service.

355
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,160
Is that too much?

356
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:10,830
But it's my wallet. Please give it back to me.

357
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:13,430
I can't until I verify your identity.

358
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:16,440
Aren't you a detective? Can't you tell that I'm him?

359
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:19,670
So you couldn't get your wallet back?

360
00:17:20,075 --> 00:17:22,470
He said I can't get it without checking my identity.

361
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:25,110
How can he be a detective when he's not keen?

362
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,750
No makeup can cover up...

363
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:29,780
my handsome face.

364
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,020
I'm home.

365
00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:33,150
Chewbacca, did you go to Busan?

366
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:34,720
I told you not to call me...

367
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:35,990
Goodness.

368
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:38,790
- Who is this? - Who else would do this?

369
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:40,990
Is it Jun Ki? What happened to you?

370
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:42,230
I don't know.

371
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:44,090
How can you react by hitting first?

372
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,330
I'm sorry. I didn't know that it was you.

373
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:49,670
If you had known, you would've hit me with the corner.

374
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:52,510
Thank you for hitting me with the surface.

375
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:54,540
Let's eat.

376
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:55,910
Come and eat.

377
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,510
It's mushroom stew. It looks delicious.

378
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:03,780
Du Shik, I'll take Sol. You should eat.

379
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:04,780
Aren't you going to eat?

380
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:06,850
I had some bread, so I'm not hungry.

381
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:08,890
Go to your mom.

382
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:11,360
- Here you go. - Gosh.

383
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:16,630
Goodness.

384
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:21,430
The soup is delicious.

385
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:22,800
Don't you think, Dong Gu?

386
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:24,640
Well, it's not bad.

387
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,210
I'm glad to hear that.

388
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,240
I was worried that you wouldn't like it.

389
00:18:31,313 --> 00:18:32,680
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

390
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:35,080
- Please try some. - Okay.

391
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:43,090
- Come on. - Are you an animal?

392
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:47,930
Yoon Ah, I have a favor to ask.

393
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:49,360
What is it?

394
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:01,910
Do you have to eat like that?

395
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,040
I lose my role if I mess up the makeup.

396
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,610
Have some soup too.

397
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:12,550
It's nice and spicy. It's delicious.

398
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:13,920
Help yourself.

399
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:25,200
Hello? Soo Ah, can you meet me just once?

400
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,430
Just give me one minute.

401
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,670
I'll explain everything. We can't break up like this.

402
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:32,070
Hello?

403
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,480
She hung up again. Let's call again.

404
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:39,680
Gosh, my stomach hurts. Why is this happening?

405
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:47,620
What's going on?

406
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:49,590
- What is everyone doing here? - Don't talk to us.

407
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,760
Chewbacca, come out now.

408
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,090
I'm dying here.

409
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:56,890
I'm dying too.

410
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:59,200
At least you can talk, but I...

411
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,440
Does your stomach hurt? Yours too?

412
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:08,710
My stomach started hurting after lunch.

413
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:10,270
I can't hold it.

414
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,380
Goodness.

415
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:13,480
Jun Ki.

416
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,250
What's going on?

417
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:18,620
What did we eat wrong? What did we eat for lunch?

418
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,520
Mushroom stew, kimchi, and...

419
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:22,720
Mushroom stew?

420
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,060
No way.

421
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,300
What's wrong?

422
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:36,240
By any chance,

423
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:39,440
did you make that stew with this mushroom?

424
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,340
Yes. Why?

425
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:42,910
What do you mean by why?

426
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:46,250
I told you to throw this away. It's gone bad!

427
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,780
Pardon? Oh, no! I'm sorry.

428
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:51,080
I think I couldn't hear what you said because of Sol.

429
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,880
Saying sorry doesn't make anything different.

430
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,420
Everyone's sick now!

431
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,960
Goodness! I'm sorry. I really am!

432
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:00,960
Alright.

433
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:05,600
I had enough of this. Just pack your stuff, and leave right now.

434
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,970
Dong Gu!

435
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:30,590
Until the East sea dries

436
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:32,790
And Mount Baekdu

437
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:37,500
Wears

438
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:42,700
The Almighty will help us

439
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:47,940
There it is!

440
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:53,380
(Out of order)

441
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,720
What are you doing now?

442
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,460
I'm really sorry.

443
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:08,460
Soo Ah.

444
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,160
Wait, wait!

445
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,160
- Please, I need to talk to you. - I have nothing talk to you.

446
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:16,300
Wait! Please, just give me one minute.

447
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:19,840
Right. I'll give you a minute. What do you want to tell me?

448
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:21,640
I mean...

449
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,510
Soo Ah, I...

450
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:29,250
I'm really sorry but...

451
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:32,620
- Could you please wait here? - Why would I do that?

452
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:34,620
I'll say it now then!

453
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:37,960
- Why is this happening now? - What?

454
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,060
No, don't get me wrong. I'll tell you now.

455
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:45,130
Soo Ah, it's all my fault.

456
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:47,270
- I'm so sorry. - What are you sorry for?

457
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:50,370
- For everything. - What is everything?

458
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:51,470
Be specific.

459
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:52,640
Be specific?

460
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:55,110
So...

461
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:03,980
I tried to sell our couple rings.

462
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:05,120
And?

463
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,780
I'm irresponsible.

464
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:08,690
- And? - Is there more?

465
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:11,860
You are right. It's...

466
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,360
What was that?

467
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:23,000
Did you just fart...

468
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:24,570
in this situation?

469
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:27,510
No, I didn't. It was this noise.

470
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:29,710
You even joke in this kind of situation.

471
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:31,140
Right. This is it.

472
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:33,680
Wait, Soo Ah! It's not what you think!

473
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,320
You are not even stopping me anymore.

474
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:45,590
- I would love to do that, but... - Fine.

475
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,960
We are really done. Got it?

476
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:50,260
Please wait, Soo Ah.

477
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:58,470
I'm really sorry, Soo Ah.

478
00:24:13,722 --> 00:24:15,260
Bath... Bathroom.

479
00:24:15,524 --> 00:24:17,120
It's a bathroom.

480
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:31,500
(Public toilets for sales)

481
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:33,570
You can look around first.

482
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,010
This kind of portable toilets are...

483
00:24:36,144 --> 00:24:37,840
quite popular these days.

484
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:39,250
- Would you like to look at it? - Okay.

485
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:41,780
Why is it locked?

486
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:45,120
- What's going on? - It's occupied.

487
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:47,220
Who is this?

488
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:50,120
Do I have to tell you that?

489
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,520
What are you doing there?

490
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:53,890
Please wait, I'm almost done.

491
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:55,790
Almost done? Done with what?

492
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:57,130
What a weird man.

493
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:59,730
It's a toilet. Of course, I'm pooping. Should I cook here?

494
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,030
What did you say?

495
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:03,870
What are you talking about? Get out!

496
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:06,840
- Get out of there right now! - What is he doing?

497
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,810
- Get out right now! - I'll see you out there.

498
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:14,050
What are you doing here? This is my business property.

499
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,610
I'm sorry.

500
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:18,680
I thought this was a public toilet. I was really in a hurry.

501
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:22,250
I don't care if you were in a hurry or not. This is a new product.

502
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:24,390
How could you poop there?

503
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:26,160
What should I do with this now?

504
00:25:26,428 --> 00:25:27,760
What a mess!

505
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:29,690
Who's going to buy this?

506
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:32,430
I'm really sorry. I'll take care of it.

507
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:33,700
Dong Gu?

508
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:38,900
Yoon Ah? Why are you here?

509
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:41,640
You all got food poisoning from me, so I went to get some medicine.

510
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:45,910
Dong Gu, did you really poop there by chance?

511
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:49,520
- That's... - It's such a mess.

512
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:51,220
He pooped so much in there.

513
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,830
Dong Gu.

514
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:08,030
Isn't that too much?

515
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:14,000
I know, right? Why would you buy that when we have a normal bathroom?

516
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,010
Well, after going through what happened today,

517
00:26:17,145 --> 00:26:18,980
I realized that we don't have enough toilets.

518
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:22,680
We could have installed some more toilet. Why do we need that?

519
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:32,360
Goodness!

520
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm so sorry.

521
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:41,700
You should've been more careful.

522
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,170
That's Dong Gu's only award.

523
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:48,640
I'm sorry.

524
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:52,680
It's okay. It's not like you did that intentionally, Yoon Ah.

525
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:55,280
People do make mistakes.

526
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:57,980
- Don't worry about it. - What's going on?

527
00:26:57,986 --> 00:26:59,650
You told her to pack and leave earlier.

528
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:01,190
That was like a shock tactic.

529
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:03,520
I'm kind of supporting her to do a better job in the future.

530
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:08,260
Yoon Ah, forget about what happened so far.

531
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:10,460
Let's get along.

532
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:12,430
- What? - Okay?

533
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,700
Okay.

534
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,110
There's one condition though. Took the secret to the grave.

535
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:24,810
Don't worry about that.

536
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:28,250
Thank you.

537
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:37,090
Hello.

538
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:41,860
Hi.

539
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:44,500
Goodness.

540
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,640
It's fine. I'll pick it up later. Go have a seat.

541
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:56,710
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm sorry.

543
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:06,820
What am I doing now?

544
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:11,090
This is so annoying. I'm going to succeed and get a main role soon.

545
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:18,900
A mutant?

546
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:57,500
My stomach...

547
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:12,290
Seo Jin!

548
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:14,190
Yoon Ah.

549
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:22,960
(You know what? It's a secret.)

550
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,140
Why did you do that?

551
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:39,450
It just looked fun for my dad and my brother, so I copied them.

552
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:43,220
But my hair got thicker since then.

553
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:48,620
What's so bad about it? You just need to shave sometimes.

554
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:49,890
It's not just sometimes.

555
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,860
If I don't shave for about half a day,

556
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:55,200
I look like a caveman.

557
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,930
How stupid is that?

558
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:00,730
Among all the things you could imitate, why did you do that?

559
00:30:00,735 --> 00:30:03,170
I didn't know this would happen to me.

560
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:04,870
Is that why she's called Chewbacca?

561
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:07,140
Chewbacca isn't the only one.

562
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:10,410
Bayaba, Zhang Fei, Im Kkeok Jeong, and Jang Seung Eop...

563
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,880
- Everyone that's hairy is... - Stop it!

564
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:15,010
It's okay.

565
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:17,450
It's not your fault to have some facial hair. Don't worry.

566
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:18,720
Thank you.

567
00:30:21,122 --> 00:30:23,390
Hello, Yoo Jin. What's up?

568
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:25,990
What? Tae Hyun is coming!

569
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:28,360
I see. I'll be there soon.

570
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:32,060
Isn't he the one you've been in love with since your freshman year?

571
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,200
- That's not it. - What do you mean?

572
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:35,930
You're a lucky girl.

573
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,000
You even have time to date.

574
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:38,440
I can take care of myself.

575
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,570
Mind your own business, will you?

576
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:41,570
Fine.

577
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:42,740
I should get ready.

578
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:45,880
Look at you. Are you that happy?

579
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,780
But she hasn't been able to tell him about her feelings.

580
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:51,650
If you think about it, she's bad at dating.

581
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:55,020
Can you really say that when you've never had a girlfriend?

582
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:58,420
- Yoon Ah. - There he goes again.

583
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:01,360
We ran out of bread and eggs in the kitchen. What happened?

584
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:02,460
Oh, my.

585
00:31:02,464 --> 00:31:04,190
I forgot to stock up. I'm sorry.

586
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:06,160
You're not supposed to forget it.

587
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,960
Didn't I tell you to purchase them in advance...

588
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,630
for our guests' breakfast?

589
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:11,430
I'm sorry. I'll go and pick them up right away.

590
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,710
Hurry.

591
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:16,440
Gosh, she never does anything right.

592
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:17,970
Give her a break.

593
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:19,410
She's doing her best.

594
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:20,510
Cut it out.

595
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:22,580
I'm sure she'll make...

596
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:24,080
a huge mistake soon.

597
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:26,120
She'll get better.

598
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:27,950
Give her some time.

599
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:30,760
Why are you back?

600
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,490
I forgot the cart. See you.

601
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:36,390
See?

602
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:37,830
How can I trust her?

603
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,500
It's no big deal.

604
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:43,440
- What is it now? - I forgot my wallet.

605
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:47,210
- See you. - See you.

606
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,710
My goodness.

607
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:54,810
Gosh. What is it?

608
00:31:54,816 --> 00:31:56,750
Where's the supermarket?

609
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:15,200
We came here many times, how can you still not know the route?

610
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:17,070
I'm sorry.

611
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:18,970
I'm bad with directions.

612
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:21,070
But I think I know now.

613
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:22,140
Well...

614
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:25,380
You sound so confident you're making me worried.

615
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:27,780
I'm tired of nagging.

616
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:30,020
Do things on your own from now on, okay?

617
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:32,490
Do you understand? Do you?

618
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:37,960
What are you doing there?

619
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:40,160
These toys are on sale.

620
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:43,430
I haven't bought any toys for Sol yet.

621
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:46,970
But even the discounted prices are quite high.

622
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:49,600
- Let's just go. - Well...

623
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:51,470
Pick one.

624
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:52,940
Are you sure?

625
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,640
Just one.

626
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:58,040
Thank you. Thank you so much.

627
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:02,680
Is she shameless or innocent?

628
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:09,590
- I'm sorry. - No problem.

629
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:10,720
Soo Ah.

630
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:14,090
Who is he? Do you know him?

631
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:16,260
Well, he's a friend.

632
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:20,200
A friend? Soo Ah.

633
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,600
Who is this guy? Who is he?

634
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:25,970
Hi.

635
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:28,840
I'm Soo Ah's boyfriend, Lee Yoon Seok.

636
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,240
Boyfriend?

637
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:35,280
I run a Thai restaurant near here.

638
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:37,280
If you come by, I'll treat you to a meal.

639
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:38,450
Me?

640
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,750
Dong Gu, I picked one.

641
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:42,020
I want this.

642
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:43,460
Who is she?

643
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:45,860
What?

644
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,230
She's my girlfriend.

645
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:52,130
Your girlfriend?

646
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:53,760
Are you seeing someone already?

647
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,870
You can date, but I can't?

648
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:58,570
I didn't say that.

649
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,340
What does she do?

650
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:02,410
What?

651
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:04,780
(Doctor's Bag)

652
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,950
She's a doctor. A neurosurgeon.

653
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:11,320
That's why she picks a toy like this.

654
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:14,590
What's going on?

655
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:17,520
All you care about is work.

656
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,620
Dong Gu, what are you doing?

657
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:20,860
Look at you.

658
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:22,330
Soo Ah.

659
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,830
Now that we've met,

660
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:25,800
why don't we grab a cup of coffee together?

661
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:28,800
We don't need to. We're not that close.

662
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:30,500
It doesn't matter.

663
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:31,900
When you're done,

664
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:34,200
why don't you come to my restaurant for dinner?

665
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:37,070
Well, Dr. Han is quite busy.

666
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,570
I'm not sure she'll have time.

667
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,480
But we'll try to come.

668
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:41,780
Let's go, Yoon Ah.

669
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:44,250
Excuse me.

670
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:50,050
Dong Gu, what's going on?

671
00:34:50,058 --> 00:34:52,090
- Keep your voice down. - Okay.

672
00:34:52,427 --> 00:34:54,590
So she's Soo Ah? She's beautiful.

673
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:57,630
- Please keep your voice down. - Okay.

674
00:34:58,466 --> 00:35:00,030
By the way, are you really buying me this toy?

675
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,630
Yes, I will.

676
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:04,070
So please be quiet.

677
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:12,110
What? Soo Ah already has a new boyfriend?

678
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:14,510
What does he do?

679
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:17,050
He runs a Thai restaurant or something.

680
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:21,590
He invited me to his restaurant. How arrogant.

681
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:25,090
Why did you have to lie that Yoon Ah is your girlfriend?

682
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:26,890
And she's a doctor?

683
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:29,490
I lost my temper when I saw Soo Ah...

684
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:30,490
with that guy.

685
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:34,570
Gosh. I guess it's really over between you and Soo Ah now.

686
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:36,840
No, it's not.

687
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:39,940
This might be your chance. Your last chance.

688
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:41,540
What do you mean?

689
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:42,870
Let me tell you.

690
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:45,650
You'll hear from Soo Ah soon.

691
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:47,780
No way.

692
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,720
Wait. You were right.

693
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:54,490
See? What did I tell you?

694
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:56,320
Try reading her text out loud.

695
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:00,190
"It was nice to see you. Your girlfriend is pretty."

696
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:02,400
No, that's not it.

697
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:05,030
"It was nice to see you. Your girlfriend is pretty."

698
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,830
That's more like it.

699
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,600
Do, re, mi, fa, sol. It's sol.

700
00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:11,100
You should sound really irritated.

701
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:12,540
No way.

702
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:15,010
What do you guys know?

703
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:17,070
- Dong Gu. - Yes?

704
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:18,140
Yes, you.

705
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:21,580
You're incompetent and immature and have no future.

706
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:22,880
So she dumped you.

707
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:25,350
But now she found out that you're going out with...

708
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:27,920
a feminine-looking doctor.

709
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:29,490
How would she feel?

710
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:32,360
- "Poor girl." - No. That's wrong.

711
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,560
Soo Ah must be so confused.

712
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:36,490
She's thinking so much.

713
00:36:36,497 --> 00:36:38,530
"Why?"

714
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,200
"Why would that girl go out with Dong Gu?"

715
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:42,330
"Is Dong Gu a nice guy after all?"

716
00:36:42,336 --> 00:36:45,170
"Does he have a charm that I don't know about?"

717
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:48,870
She must be going crazy. Completely crazy.

718
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:51,440
It makes sense. And?

719
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:54,240
So if you use this opportunity smartly,

720
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:57,410
you might be able to get back together with Soo Ah.

721
00:36:57,418 --> 00:37:00,580
Really? What should I do?

722
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:01,850
What do you think?

723
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:03,820
You said her boyfriend invited you to his restaurant.

724
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:07,760
You should go. Take Yoon Ah with you too.

725
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:09,530
And?

726
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:12,400
Show Soo Ah what an amazing guy you are.

727
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,170
Make her regret dumping you.

728
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:16,370
- How? - It all depends on...

729
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:19,470
Dr. Han.

730
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:23,040
What? What am I supposed to do?

731
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:26,310
Yoon Ah, please help me. I beg you.

732
00:37:26,314 --> 00:37:28,740
I'd love to help you, but I don't think I can do this.

733
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:30,180
Are you serious?

734
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:33,750
If you help me this time, I'll forget about all your mistakes.

735
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:36,220
Please help me, will you?

736
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,320
Fine.

737
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:41,060
Thank you, Yoon Ah.

738
00:37:41,062 --> 00:37:43,060
What are we supposed to do now?

739
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:46,230
Dr. Han should doll up first.

740
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:49,570
You should look elegant and gorgeous.

741
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:02,980
Gosh, my bag.

742
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,550
What are you doing here?

743
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,320
Well...

744
00:38:09,423 --> 00:38:13,260
I had to go to the career center, and I thought I'd stop by here.

745
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:17,660
By the way, when will Tae Hyun be here?

746
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:19,060
You're here to see him, aren't you?

747
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,030
No. I wanted to see you guys.

748
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,400
Cut it out.

749
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:24,200
He just called and said...

750
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:26,170
that he's running late because of an interview.

751
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:28,070
I have to go now.

752
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:31,310
Okay. I'll be going soon too.

753
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:32,580
I swear.

754
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,760
You look pretty good when you're dressed up.

755
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:53,070
You usually look so shabby.

756
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:55,030
I don't normally dress up,

757
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:57,500
but when I do, I look as good as Gong Yoo.

758
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,300
Gong Yoo, my foot.

759
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,510
You don't look that good.

760
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:01,770
Can I really trust you?

761
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:04,740
If you do as I say, everything will work out.

762
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:07,080
When I listen to you, things usually go wrong.

763
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,610
I'm not sure if it'll really be okay.

764
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:10,080
Trust me.

765
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:13,350
Your biggest weakness is that you don't trust people.

766
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:15,890
Be quiet. What's taking Yoon Ah so long?

767
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:41,250
What do you think?

768
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:44,250
It feels awkward to wear makeup after such a long time.

769
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:45,750
It looks weird, right?

770
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:48,290
No.

771
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:50,890
You look pretty. You look very pretty.

772
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:52,460
Right, Jun Ki?

773
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,460
You're right.

774
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:57,230
You look completely different with the makeup.

775
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:59,600
Don't you think, Dong Gu?

776
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:01,600
Yes.

777
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:03,940
She doesn't look bad.

778
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:06,410
- It's time to go. - Okay.

779
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:09,710
Is it okay to leave Sol with you?

780
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:11,140
Don't worry about it.

781
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:12,540
We'll take good care of Sol.

782
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:15,050
Okay, I'll be back.

783
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,850
Come back successful, Dong Gu.

784
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,820
Let's cheer for your mom.

785
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:23,090
- You can do it, Mom. - You can do it.

786
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:26,260
That's a loud way to cheer.

787
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:27,660
She's a good daughter.

788
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:29,290
Can you hold her?

789
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,960
I'm going to cheer too.

790
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:32,800
Why would you cheer now? Jun Ki.

791
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:36,770
(Hankook University Newspaper)

792
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,280
Why is it so empty here?

793
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:51,450
Seo Jin.

794
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:55,120
- Kang Seo Jin. - Yes?

795
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:59,330
Tae Hyun.

796
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:00,760
I haven't seen you in a while.

797
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,330
Yes, it's been a while.

798
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:07,800
I finished work so late. I was worried that no one would be here.

799
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:10,270
I'm happy that you waited for me.

800
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:13,840
I wasn't waiting for you. I didn't know that you were coming.

801
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,410
- I'm serious. - I heard you.

802
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,810
There's no need to fuss.

803
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:21,780
Do you want to see the renovated archive room?

804
00:41:32,026 --> 00:41:34,030
It became so clean.

805
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:37,630
There used to be spider webs and mice.

806
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:39,900
It looked haunted.

807
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,170
- Is this still here? - What is it?

808
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,310
It's this.

809
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:50,310
It's the first article that you wrote.

810
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:54,080
How is your job search going?

811
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,780
I'm trying hard.

812
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:58,350
Come to our newspaper.

813
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,550
It'd be fun to work together.

814
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:01,290
I already applied there,

815
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,160
but I didn't get in.

816
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,020
It's okay.

817
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,160
I was rejected twice before getting hired.

818
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:09,930
You'll get it next time. Don't lose hope.

819
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,680
I'm hungry. Do you want to eat?

820
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,850
Really?

821
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,750
We should eat something delicious.

822
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:34,920
- What's going on? - Why won't it open?

823
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:38,360
Oh, no.

824
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,760
Why won't it open?

825
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:42,460
Give me your phone, Seo Jin.

826
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:46,070
I left it on the desk.

827
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,130
I left mine in my bag.

828
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:49,770
Gosh, what should we do?

829
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:50,970
We're in trouble.

830
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:01,380
Yoon Ah, let's review one last time.

831
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:04,150
- What's your occupation? - The best neurosurgeon in Korea.

832
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:06,720
- Your parents? - Hospital director and painter.

833
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,950
Where did we meet?

834
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:10,090
Third table in the hospital cafeteria.

835
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,090
- Okay, are you ready? - Yes.

836
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:13,460
I'll do my best.

837
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,960
Okay, let's go in.

838
00:43:30,511 --> 00:43:33,010
I didn't expect you to show up. I'm surprised.

839
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:37,550
Luckily Yoon Ah got off work early, so we stopped by.

840
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:41,820
I thought it was a fancy restaurant,

841
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:43,790
but it's simple.

842
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:45,290
Really?

843
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:47,660
But I guarantee that the food is delicious.

844
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:50,130
Let's order first. What would you like?

845
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:51,900
Choose for us.

846
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,970
We'd like to order, please.

847
00:43:57,371 --> 00:43:58,570
We'd like...

848
00:44:05,946 --> 00:44:07,950
One of each and...

849
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:14,290
- That'd be all. - Okay, sir.

850
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:18,590
Dish names are similar to Muay Thai players.

851
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:20,660
They sound aggressive.

852
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:23,130
What kind of alcohol would you like to drink?

853
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,530
No thank you. I'm breastfeeding...

854
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,900
Pardon? Breastfeeding?

855
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:31,570
That's not what I meant.

856
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:35,040
It's not breastfeeding. She meant surgery.

857
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,480
She has an important surgery tomorrow morning.

858
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:39,450
Surgery?

859
00:44:41,882 --> 00:44:43,080
What type of surgery?

860
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,820
Pardon me? It's...

861
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,820
It's related to...

862
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,590
the small intestine.

863
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:51,990
Pardon?

864
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:55,730
You operate on the small intestine as a neurosurgeon?

865
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,600
What I mean is...

866
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:03,270
She specializes in neurosurgery,

867
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,400
but she works in multiple departments.

868
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:08,840
She's licensed in internal medicine, general surgery, and OBGYN.

869
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:12,410
Why would she fall for someone like you?

870
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:20,090
Others may think that Dong Gu has nothing to offer,

871
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:22,220
but they're wrong.

872
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:24,060
However, I saw...

873
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:26,290
Dong Gu's bright future.

874
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:30,060
No way.

875
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:32,100
Yes, I'm sure of it.

876
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:35,930
You'll definitely be the best film director in the world.

877
00:45:36,704 --> 00:45:39,070
My predictions are never wrong,

878
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,040
so you can trust me.

879
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:45,180
I can't stop her.

880
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,580
However,

881
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,920
he hasn't opened up to me yet.

882
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,050
It's hard for me.

883
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:55,790
I already told you.

884
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,360
my heart hasn't recovered yet.

885
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:01,860
It's okay. There's nothing...

886
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:04,200
I ask of you.

887
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,100
I'm sorry.

888
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:10,240
I don't deserve you.

889
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,450
We're locked in.

890
00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:25,220
We can only leave when people come in the morning.

891
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:28,290
However, being here with you...

892
00:46:30,324 --> 00:46:31,590
isn't bad.

893
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,860
What do you mean?

894
00:46:35,696 --> 00:46:39,770
Seo Jin, I have something to...

895
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,200
tell you.

896
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:43,370
What is it?

897
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,810
For a long time,

898
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:54,380
I...

899
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:59,820
What is it?

900
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:01,990
You have...

901
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,620
something under the nose.

902
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:07,530
- Is there something under my nose? - Yes.

903
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:09,230
One second.

904
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:17,570
Gosh, my mustache is growing again.

905
00:47:17,604 --> 00:47:19,470
My razor is in my bag.

906
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:22,610
What's wrong?

907
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:26,680
It's nothing.

908
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:29,350
- It's some dust. - Is that so?

909
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,780
What I wanted to tell you is...

910
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,550
Don't come near me.

911
00:47:34,555 --> 00:47:37,460
- What's wrong? - Don't come near me.

912
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:40,230
I must get out.

913
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:42,760
Everything is over if he finds out.

914
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:48,400
Hello? We're locked in here.

915
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:51,770
- Please help us. - Hey.

916
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:55,140
- What's wrong, Seo Jin? - Don't come near me.

917
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,710
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

918
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:01,410
We're locked in.

919
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:03,550
- Come back to senses. - Hello?

920
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,620
Please help us.

921
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,020
I hope you enjoyed the food.

922
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:12,060
It was fine.

923
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:15,730
It wasn't as good as traditional Thai food that we had in Bangkok.

924
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:17,160
Is that so?

925
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:19,830
I wish you could have one more drink.

926
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:21,400
I wish I could,

927
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:25,270
but she has surgery tomorrow.

928
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:27,140
We'll invite you next time.

929
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:29,910
- Take care. - You too.

930
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:32,840
It was good to meet you, Yoon Ah.

931
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:33,980
You too.

932
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:35,380
Let's go, Dong Gu.

933
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:36,520
Okay.

934
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:40,520
Get closer to me.

935
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:41,750
Like this?

936
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:43,920
Dong Gu, did I do well today?

937
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:46,490
Your acting was amazing.

938
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:47,760
It was excellent.

939
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:48,960
Thank you.

940
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:54,500
Why is my mother with your father...

941
00:48:56,537 --> 00:48:57,670
Could it be?

942
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:59,340
- Could it be? - Could it be?

943
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:00,610
No way.

944
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:04,510
Does that mean that you're my father's daughter?

945
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,750
Daughter? I'm sorry.

946
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:09,310
Are you my half-sister?

947
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:11,650
- Sister? - How could this be?

948
00:49:11,685 --> 00:49:13,820
That's impossible.

949
00:49:13,854 --> 00:49:16,720
Gosh, what's going on?

950
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:18,620
Why do you think it's impossible?

951
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:22,030
- "Why do you think so?" - Nothing is impossible.

952
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:23,730
There are only...

953
00:49:24,565 --> 00:49:26,800
nasty desires that you want to hide.

954
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,930
- I'm scared. - What are you talking about?

955
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:31,970
30 years ago, you abandoned Yoo Geum Ran.

956
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:34,370
- I know who that is. - Yoo Geum Ran?

957
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:35,840
How do you know her?

958
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:39,110
I'm her daughter.

959
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:41,450
What did you say?

960
00:49:42,683 --> 00:49:44,280
Are you my daughter too?

961
00:49:44,284 --> 00:49:46,580
- It's his daughter. - My goodness.

962
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:48,620
I made up my mind.

963
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:50,790
I swore I'd get my revenge on you.

964
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:52,890
What?

965
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,220
You evil witch!

966
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:56,160
- Evil witch. - Evil witch.

967
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:57,670
You're an evil witch!

968
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:08,010
- Bravo! - Bravo!

969
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:10,210
There are no bounds to imagination.

970
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,110
I can't help but give a big hand.

971
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,880
You would've known that the father-in-law's wife was also...

972
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,080
his daughter?

973
00:50:15,082 --> 00:50:16,390
Me too. Me too.

974
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:18,810
How can I wait until tomorrow?

975
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:21,580
- I'll die of curiosity. - Me too.

976
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:22,580
What are you guys doing?

977
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:24,630
- You guys are back. - Hi guys.

978
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:26,660
How did it go?

979
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,460
It didn't go so smoothly in the beginning,

980
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:30,830
but Yoon Ah's better at acting than I'd expected.

981
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:33,060
Really? Yoon Ah, that's pretty impressive.

982
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:35,070
I just did what I could do.

983
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:36,480
But...

984
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,870
do you really think this will work?

985
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,370
Of course it will.

986
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:42,440
Soo Ah will have so many thoughts in her head by now.

987
00:50:42,442 --> 00:50:43,870
"Why on earth did I dump such a great guy like him?"

988
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:46,550
"Was I a fool?" These are what she'll be asking herself.

989
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,350
I sure do hope it turns out like you said.

990
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:51,710
Anyway, did Sol cause you a lot of trouble?

991
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,480
No, not at all. She only vomited 5 times, went poop 7 times,

992
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:56,950
and peed about nine times.

993
00:50:56,957 --> 00:50:58,990
My goodness. She's doing something again right now.

994
00:50:58,992 --> 00:51:00,820
You can give Sol to me now. I'll take care of her.

995
00:51:00,827 --> 00:51:03,390
- It's about time. - It's all right, Sol.

996
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:05,390
My arms are sore. I need something to eat. I'm starving.

997
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:06,560
Yes, go ahead, and eat something.

998
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:08,700
- I think I'll go play a game. - You do that. Go on.

999
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:11,670
Sol, did you give your uncles a hard time?

1000
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:13,540
Sol, did you miss Mommy?

1001
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,810
Mommy missed you so much, Sol.

1002
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,080
Did you just say "Mommy"?

1003
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:20,090
What are you talking about?

1004
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:24,318
Sol, did you miss Mommy?

1005
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:27,920
Mommy missed you so much, Sol.

1006
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,189
Did you just say "Mommy"?

1007
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:31,191
What are you talking about?

1008
00:51:33,493 --> 00:51:35,429
Soo Ah, what brings you here?

1009
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,164
- Yoon Ah left her purse. - What?

1010
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:40,100
My goodness. I didn't know.

1011
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,601
Thank you.

1012
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:43,870
But why did she say "Mommy"? What is she talking about?

1013
00:51:43,904 --> 00:51:45,639
You two had a child?

1014
00:51:45,706 --> 00:51:47,074
Since when...

1015
00:51:47,674 --> 00:51:50,110
Were you two meeting while you and I were in a relationship?

1016
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,080
No. What are you talking about? I'd be cursed if that were true.

1017
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,149
Then how do you explain this?

1018
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,585
Yoon Ah adores kids.

1019
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:00,921
She lets kids call her "Mommy". It's just a habit.

1020
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:02,723
- Isn't that right, Yoon Ah? - Exactly.

1021
00:52:02,723 --> 00:52:04,758
How could I have a child at my age?

1022
00:52:04,758 --> 00:52:07,361
- You're so cute. - Then who's baby is that?

1023
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:08,895
Wait.

1024
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:12,432
Come to think of it, isn't she the baby you said a guest left behind?

1025
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:15,168
You see,

1026
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:17,904
we decided to raise her.

1027
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:21,108
Why? Why would you raise a stranger's child?

1028
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:24,678
You see, the thing is...

1029
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:27,748
she's Jun Ki's child.

1030
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:33,086
What? She's Jun Ki's child?

1031
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,422
Then the person that left that baby here was...

1032
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,257
Jun Ki's girlfriend?

1033
00:52:37,257 --> 00:52:40,827
That's right. You know he's a low life. He's being punished.

1034
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:42,462
Is this true, Jun Ki?

1035
00:52:49,102 --> 00:52:52,139
Yes. You know how much of a low life I am.

1036
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:55,275
You're right. You're the type that would do something like this.

1037
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,444
Thank you for bringing the purse.

1038
00:52:57,444 --> 00:52:59,946
It's late. You should get going.

1039
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:02,716
We'd be sad to leave like this.

1040
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:06,153
Give us a tour of the guesthouse. Let's have some beer as well.

1041
00:53:06,553 --> 00:53:07,888
Sounds great. Let's do that.

1042
00:53:07,888 --> 00:53:10,557
Yoon Ah. Why don't you take the two up to the third floor?

1043
00:53:10,557 --> 00:53:12,826
I'll be right up with the beers.

1044
00:53:12,826 --> 00:53:13,894
All right.

1045
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:16,863
Sol, you can stay here with your dad.

1046
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:20,967
Dad, Dad, Dad.

1047
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:24,838
You're my daughter, aren't you?

1048
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:26,506
- Follow me this way. - All right.

1049
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,977
Go ahead upstairs. I'll be right up with the beers.

1050
00:53:32,245 --> 00:53:33,713
What do you think you're doing? Are you crazy?

1051
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:36,049
I didn't know what to do. It just came out.

1052
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:40,020
Never mind.

1053
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:41,855
Don't mind me.

1054
00:53:41,855 --> 00:53:44,825
Don't worry about a low life like me. Go on upstairs.

1055
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,359
- Forgive me, Jun Ki. - Don't touch me.

1056
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:47,694
I'm really sorry.

1057
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:56,102
My daughter?

1058
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:11,685
What will I do? It's getting thicker and thicker.

1059
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:14,054
If he finds out I have a mustache, there'll be no future with him.

1060
00:54:14,054 --> 00:54:15,522
This is driving me crazy.

1061
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:21,528
I'm sleepy.

1062
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:23,997
Why am I so sleepy?

1063
00:54:25,899 --> 00:54:27,200
Wake up.

1064
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:30,937
I can't fall asleep. There's no way I can fall asleep.

1065
00:54:40,046 --> 00:54:41,882
I must've dozed off for a while.

1066
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:57,664
What are you doing?

1067
00:54:57,664 --> 00:54:59,065
Seo Jin. It's not what you think.

1068
00:54:59,065 --> 00:55:00,767
I was just going to cover you with my coat. I thought you'd be cold.

1069
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,536
I told you not to come close.

1070
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:06,473
Tae Hyun.

1071
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,708
Tae Hyun. Wake up.

1072
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:11,411
Tae Hyun. Forgive me. I'm sorry.

1073
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:13,346
Please wake up.

1074
00:55:14,014 --> 00:55:16,850
Tae Hyun. Are you all right? Are you conscious?

1075
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:20,053
My head... My head hurts.

1076
00:55:27,627 --> 00:55:28,962
Hey. Do you...

1077
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:31,798
have a mustache?

1078
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:38,772
I'm so sorry.

1079
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:42,075
I'm truly sorry.

1080
00:55:46,313 --> 00:55:49,282
The guesthouse is very nice. It's so cozy.

1081
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,219
Yoon Ah insists I close the guesthouse and...

1082
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:54,888
and focus on making films,

1083
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:57,457
but it just doesn't feel right.

1084
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:59,426
Without receiving Yoon Ah's financial support...

1085
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:02,662
I want to succeed on my own.

1086
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:04,598
I see.

1087
00:56:04,598 --> 00:56:06,099
Yoon Ah. I'm sorry...

1088
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,969
for being so selfish.

1089
00:56:09,102 --> 00:56:10,837
Don't say that.

1090
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:16,376
"Emergency! Sol's screaming and crying for food."

1091
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:18,712
"I earnestly request that you come urgently."

1092
00:56:19,946 --> 00:56:22,983
Excuse me. I have to go to the restroom.

1093
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:25,919
Well then...

1094
00:56:26,486 --> 00:56:27,754
Then...

1095
00:56:28,088 --> 00:56:30,056
why don't we toast to your dream?

1096
00:56:30,056 --> 00:56:31,391
Shall we?

1097
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:34,160
We're out of beer.

1098
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,763
I'll go and get some. I need to go to the restroom anyway.

1099
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,501
All right.

1100
00:56:50,377 --> 00:56:52,779
Sol. Were you hungry?

1101
00:56:53,213 --> 00:56:55,181
Are you happy now that I'm breastfeeding you?

1102
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:58,051
There you go, my little baby.

1103
00:56:58,051 --> 00:57:01,721
Let's eat. Let's eat.

1104
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:04,157
There you go. Let's eat.

1105
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:08,728
Jun Ki.

1106
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,064
Yoon Ah.

1107
00:57:11,865 --> 00:57:13,166
What on earth...

1108
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,769
are you doing right now?

1109
00:57:16,503 --> 00:57:19,639
- Soo Ah. - Why on earth...

1110
00:57:20,073 --> 00:57:23,777
are you breastfeeding Jun Ki's child?

1111
00:57:24,511 --> 00:57:26,713
Listen. Let me explain.

1112
00:57:26,713 --> 00:57:27,947
Yoon Ah. I bought the diapers.

1113
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:30,150
Soo Ah. You're still here. My goodness. Soo Ah.

1114
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:33,720
Jun Ki. Why is Yoon Ah breastfeeding your child?

1115
00:57:34,854 --> 00:57:36,656
You see, so...

1116
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:39,292
She's donating breast milk. That's what she's doing.

1117
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:41,528
You know how they say breast milk is good for immunity.

1118
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:44,531
What? You're getting breast milk from Dong Gu's girlfriend?

1119
00:57:44,531 --> 00:57:45,799
Wait a minute.

1120
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:47,701
How can an unmarried woman breastfeed?

1121
00:57:47,734 --> 00:57:49,803
That's right. She's not married.

1122
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:53,473
But you see, occasionally, when she's in a good mood...

1123
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,475
- if she tries real hard... - Stop the nonsense!

1124
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:57,377
Yoon Ah. You explain.

1125
00:57:57,377 --> 00:57:58,678
What's going on here?

1126
00:57:58,678 --> 00:58:01,214
Well, you see...

1127
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:04,484
To tell you the truth, Sol's my daughter.

1128
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:06,486
What? She's your daughter?

1129
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:07,554
You said she's your daughter earlier.

1130
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:09,622
That's right. She was my daughter. No, she's my daughter.

1131
00:58:09,622 --> 00:58:11,791
You said your ex-girlfriend left her here.

1132
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:13,460
Then how can she be Yoon Ah's child?

1133
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,996
Then Yoon Ah's your ex-girlfriend? That's impossible.

1134
00:58:22,802 --> 00:58:25,071
Why do you think it's impossible?

1135
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:27,941
Nothing is impossible.

1136
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:30,944
There are only nasty desires that you want to hide.

1137
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:32,846
What are you talking about?

1138
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:35,515
Then you're saying Yoon Ah's your ex-girlfriend,

1139
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:38,284
and this child is yours and Yoon Ah's child?

1140
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:40,920
I wanted to keep this a secret.

1141
00:58:41,254 --> 00:58:42,722
Then do you mean Dong Gu doesn't know about this?

1142
00:58:42,722 --> 00:58:44,958
At first, I was going to tell him,

1143
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,993
but he was so heartbroken after breaking up with you...

1144
00:58:46,993 --> 00:58:48,962
that I couldn't find the heart to tell him.

1145
00:58:49,395 --> 00:58:51,297
Yoon Ah. Is this all true?

1146
00:58:51,297 --> 00:58:53,433
Well, actually...

1147
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:55,001
Shut your mouth, Yoon Ah!

1148
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:57,003
You don't have any right to say a word.

1149
00:58:57,003 --> 00:59:00,907
Soo Ah. This girl will do anything to get what she wants.

1150
00:59:00,907 --> 00:59:04,277
You're the only person that can save Dong Gu from that evil witch.

1151
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,180
Can you please take Dong Gu back?

1152
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,051
I beg you.

1153
00:59:13,419 --> 00:59:14,554
- Jun Ki. - What?

1154
00:59:14,554 --> 00:59:16,189
- Did you plan this with Dong Gu? - No.

1155
00:59:16,189 --> 00:59:18,458
You know exactly what happens if I catch you in a lie, don't you?

1156
00:59:18,758 --> 00:59:20,660
Look me straight in the eye.

1157
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,462
You're in this together, aren't you?

1158
00:59:22,629 --> 00:59:24,531
I don't think so.

1159
00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:26,432
You still don't get it, do you?

1160
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,903
- You still won't tell the truth? - I will. I'll tell you everything.

1161
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:32,305
- So what is it? - You see, tiny pieces...

1162
00:59:32,305 --> 00:59:35,074
- added up and became huge. - What are you talking about?

1163
00:59:35,074 --> 00:59:36,075
You see...

1164
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:37,076
I can't forget...

1165
00:59:37,076 --> 00:59:40,947
the night sky I saw at Yoon Ah's vacation home in Malibu.

1166
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,485
It seemed as though gold dust was sprinkled in the sky.

1167
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,923
Why don't the four of us go together sometime?

1168
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:51,691
I'd love that.

1169
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:53,393
Great.

1170
00:59:53,726 --> 00:59:55,128
You're back.

1171
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:58,131
Soo Ah. Yoon Seok and I were just talking about...

1172
00:59:58,131 --> 01:00:00,767
going to Yoon Ah's vacation home in Malibu together sometime.

1173
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,302
You're okay with that, right?

1174
01:00:03,837 --> 01:00:05,638
Why are you looking at me like that?

1175
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:07,407
Is there something on my face?

1176
01:00:07,507 --> 01:00:09,108
No. It's on the back of your head.

1177
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:10,510
I'll get it off for you.

1178
01:00:20,386 --> 01:00:22,121
Soo Ah. Soo Ah.

1179
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:24,724
Soo Ah. I was wrong. I'm really sorry.

1180
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:27,126
Let go of me before I smack you again.

1181
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:28,528
Wait a minute. Soo Ah.

1182
01:00:28,528 --> 01:00:30,697
I wouldn't have done this if I don't mean this.

1183
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:33,733
I really love you. I can't break up with you.

1184
01:00:33,766 --> 01:00:35,969
Is that right? What a shame though.

1185
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:38,905
I have no feelings left for you whatsoever now.

1186
01:00:39,505 --> 01:00:41,908
I never want to see you again.

1187
01:00:41,908 --> 01:00:44,377
So don't ever show your face in front of me again.

1188
01:00:46,012 --> 01:00:47,714
Soo Ah. Soo Ah.

1189
01:00:49,315 --> 01:00:50,717
Soo Ah.

1190
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:11,905
Dong Gu. Stop drinking.

1191
01:01:11,905 --> 01:01:14,974
Dong Gu. Stop drinking. You've had too much to drink.

1192
01:01:14,974 --> 01:01:16,409
Leave me alone.

1193
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:19,946
I plan on drinking until I die. Don't stop me.

1194
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:22,949
Things never end well if we listen to you.

1195
01:01:23,116 --> 01:01:25,318
I didn't know things would get so complicated.

1196
01:01:25,752 --> 01:01:27,220
Gosh.

1197
01:01:42,502 --> 01:01:46,039
Both the brother and sister are pathetic. I can't believe this.

1198
01:01:48,841 --> 01:01:49,909
Be quiet, you wench!

1199
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:51,778
Tae Hyun.

1200
01:01:51,778 --> 01:01:54,013
Soo Ah!

1201
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:56,916
This is so exhausting.

1202
01:01:56,916 --> 01:02:01,120
- Tae Hyun. - Soo Ah!

1203
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:03,489
Come down. Come down.

1204
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:04,824
It's so noisy because of you.

1205
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:07,794
Soo Ah!

1206
01:02:12,098 --> 01:02:13,933
Stop drinking. Stop drinking.

1207
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:19,205
Let go. Don't stop me.

1208
01:02:32,618 --> 01:02:35,888
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1209
01:02:35,888 --> 01:02:37,757
How much longer are you going to be like this?

1210
01:02:37,757 --> 01:02:39,459
A new girl will help you forget about her.

1211
01:02:39,459 --> 01:02:41,928
I'm sure you'll meet someone better. Cheer up.

1212
01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:45,131
Kim Hee Ja? The top actress in Korea, Kim Hee Ja?

1213
01:02:45,131 --> 01:02:47,066
I'll do anything you say, Director!

1214
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:50,169
This is a story about swimmers. I've never seen hairy swimmers.

1215
01:02:50,169 --> 01:02:53,373
Hello. I'll be doing your waxing today.

1216
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:55,942
Does this mean this is the end of my life as a man?

1217
01:02:55,942 --> 01:02:57,610
Lee Jun Ki's life is doomed!

1218
01:02:57,643 --> 01:03:00,113
Seo Jin. Would you like to be my girlfriend?

1219
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:02,915
They think they're characters in a movie. I can't stand them.

1220
01:03:03,149 --> 01:03:05,251
He picks his nose all the time.

1221
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:07,987
He doesn't wash his hands afterwards and eats kimbab with them.

1222
01:03:07,987 --> 01:03:09,989
He even pinches my cheeks. I thought I was going crazy.

1223
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:11,290
He's getting married soon.

1224
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:13,793
How do you think he'll feel when he finds out Yoon Ah had his child?

1225
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:15,862
What did you just say? She gave birth to my child?

1226
01:03:15,862 --> 01:03:17,263
Do you intend to ruin my life?

1227
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:19,265
You should be grateful that I'm even giving you this.

1228
01:03:19,265 --> 01:03:21,768
How do I know you're not playing games with me?

1229
01:03:21,768 --> 01:03:23,136
Wait a minute!
