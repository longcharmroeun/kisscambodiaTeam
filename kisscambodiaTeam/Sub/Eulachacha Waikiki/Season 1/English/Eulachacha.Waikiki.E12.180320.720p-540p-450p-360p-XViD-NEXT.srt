1
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:14,584
To me, you're a man. What should I do?

2
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:18,321
- Of course, I'm a man. - That's not what I'm saying.

3
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,326
I think I like you.

4
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:26,763
- What? - I like you.

5
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:34,804
Why are you doing this? Come here.

6
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,874
Are you ill? You seem fine.

7
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,744
Is this a prank?

8
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:42,145
Did you set this up with the others?

9
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:46,283
- You're really good at acting. - I really like you.

10
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:51,755
What?

11
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:53,923
Do you mean it?

12
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,394
You like me?

13
00:00:58,662 --> 00:00:59,896
You?

14
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:01,364
I'll ask you this again.

15
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:04,267
Am I...

16
00:01:05,502 --> 00:01:06,836
not a woman to you?

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,805
Why are you doing this?

18
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:10,974
You can't be a woman to me. You're like my little sister.

19
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:12,375
I saw you since you were little.

20
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,678
We even share razors.

21
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:17,213
Don't do this. Don't.

22
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:23,486
All right.

23
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:27,891
I get what you're saying. Get out.

24
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:32,162
Why are you being so scary?

25
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,930
- Get out. - What?

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,032
- Get out! - Hey. Seo Jin.

27
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:38,001
- Seo Jin. - I told you to get out.

28
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,705
Seo Jin. Seo Jin, open the door.

29
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:43,773
We should talk. Seo Jin!

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,275
What is this?

31
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:49,212
Why are you knocking on my sister's door?

32
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:51,781
I told you not to go anywhere near my sister!

33
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,917
- It's not like that. - Come here! Come here!

34
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:56,286
- Dong Gu, it's not like that. - What?

35
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,392
Gosh, I don't need to feel bad.

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,895
He always causes trouble...

37
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:08,932
and earns his living by playing as extras.

38
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:26,816
(I'm a Woman Too)

39
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,285
Do I know Goni?

40
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:32,122
(Kim Hye Soo)

41
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:35,925
- He's the best gambler I've seen. - "Do I know Goni?"

42
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:38,661
"He's the best gambler I've seen."

43
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:42,365
Gosh, I want to be like Kim Hye Soo.

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,635
I want to have a cool life like her.

45
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:49,072
I agree. She's so cool.

46
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,509
- I'm home. - Hello.

47
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,211
Du Shik, why were you so late? I've been waiting for you.

48
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:57,180
Me? Why?

49
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,448
- Do you have something to tell me? - Yes.

50
00:02:58,448 --> 00:02:59,949
You told me...

51
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,552
to find something that will make me happy for the rest of my life.

52
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,288
That's why I've been thinking, as I'm pretty...

53
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:06,689
and good at singing and dancing... You knew that, right?

54
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:07,824
I didn't.

55
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:09,225
So what do you want to do?

56
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:11,628
- I want to become an idol. - What? An idol?

57
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:13,730
You want to become an idol at the age of 29?

58
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,765
You're old enough to have a baby of your own.

59
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:17,634
- You must be crazy. - Gosh.

60
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,703
Maybe that's too much.

61
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,672
What should I do?

62
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:24,974
Isn't there anything you've always wanted to do,

63
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,976
maybe as a child?

64
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,545
There's one.

65
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:32,882
I've always wanted to learn fashion design at college.

66
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,118
But I can't take the entrance test at this age.

67
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:37,420
Why not? Haven't you read the news?

68
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,055
There are so many elders...

69
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:41,257
nearing the age of 70 who attend college after taking the test.

70
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,226
- Do you think I can do that? - Of course.

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,395
I'll help you with your studies.

72
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,363
- You? - "You?"

73
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,066
He used to be called a genius.

74
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,969
He's a writer who is good at everything else except for writing.

75
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,604
- Be quiet. - Yes, Writer Bong.

76
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:57,707
But you need to promise me to do your very best.

77
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,776
I will. Thank you, Du Shik.

78
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:03,847
I'm home.

79
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,416
Hello, Seo Jin. Did you eat?

80
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,751
I'm not hungry. I'll go rest in my room.

81
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,922
Is there something wrong with Seo Jin?

82
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:15,024
She hasn't been looking well these past few days.

83
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,896
- Why did we come to a bookstore? - Well,

84
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:22,565
to prepare for the entrance test, you need to buy a book.

85
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,469
I need to know your level first,

86
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:28,171
so I'll take a simple test.

87
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:31,574
Well, let's start with history.

88
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:35,144
Who was the crown prince that was the second son of King Yeongjo...

89
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:37,814
and the father of King Jeongjo,

90
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:41,284
who ruled in Yeongjo's place, but was ordered to a tragic death?

91
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:42,785
- I know that one. - Really?

92
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,787
- I even saw the movie. - Yes.

93
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:46,723
- Give me a hint. - Hint? Hint. All right.

94
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:48,057
- A wooden rice chest. - A wooden rice chest?

95
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:49,959
I know it!

96
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,261
- Yoo Ah In. - Yoo...

97
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:54,097
It's the crown prince.

98
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:56,299
Yes, it's Yoo Ah In.

99
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,500
No, which crown prince is it?

100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,169
- The crown prince. - I told you it's Yoo Ah In.

101
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,604
In the movie, he says,

102
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:03,206
"I'm dumbfounded."

103
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,444
That was in the movie, "Veteran".

104
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,380
And the name of the crown prince is Sado.

105
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,614
Crown Prince Sado?

106
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:15,985
So that's why the movie is called "Sado".

107
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,755
- Yes. - Gosh, they did mention Sado,

108
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,924
but I thought it meant something else.

109
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:27,330
It's fine. You can study again.

110
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,165
Don't feel too bad.

111
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:30,867
Thanks.

112
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:33,570
It's nice to hear positive encouragements from you.

113
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,872
It's nice to be positive at all times.

114
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:38,241
So don't you worry. Cheer up!

115
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,043
All right. I'll cheer up.

116
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:50,086
I haven't been home for a few days, nor have I had a chance to wash.

117
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:53,556
By the way,

118
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,527
I don't even remember the last time I saw Yoon Ah.

119
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:11,240
Gosh.

120
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,142
Kang Dong Gu.

121
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,845
Do you have the papers ready regarding the venues?

122
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:17,413
Yes, here you are.

123
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,183
Oh, my. You found a lot.

124
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:23,252
You must have worked overnight. Well done.

125
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:25,922
But I think you'll have to work tonight again. I'm sorry.

126
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:27,357
It's fine.

127
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:30,093
Then you should go visit a sauna or something for a short time.

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,995
I'll give you an hour.

129
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:34,931
An hour?

130
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,400
Soo Ah, try reading this.

131
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,534
Can you do it?

132
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,739
Gosh, of course I can.

133
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,474
What do you take me for?

134
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,143
- Let me start. - Okay.

135
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,545
"Hi, Johnny."

136
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,415
- "Do you..." - It's not Johnny. It's "Jane".

137
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:55,785
Okay. Let me try again.

138
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:58,221
"Hi, Jane."

139
00:06:58,388 --> 00:07:01,524
"Do you want some pine..."

140
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,194
"Pine..."

141
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:06,963
Pineapple.

142
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,899
That's right. Pineapple.

143
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:12,402
I mixed them up. My misty.

144
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:14,003
Not "misty".

145
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,905
Mistake.

146
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,206
What?

147
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,510
I was talking about the drama. You don't know "Misty"?

148
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,744
Kim Nam Joo's in it.

149
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,047
It's my fabric drama.

150
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:26,015
Not "fabric".

151
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:27,850
Favorite.

152
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,020
I see.

153
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,424
Sorry. English is definitely not my forte.

154
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,194
I'm sure it's just because it's been a long time. Don't worry.

155
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:40,396
Thank you, Du Shik. Let me try again.

156
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,299
Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

157
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,001
What's going on?

158
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:47,937
Dong Gu, it's been a while.

159
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:49,038
Are you finished today?

160
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:50,640
Cut it out. Where is Yoon Ah?

161
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,875
She should be somewhere in this house. Why?

162
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,211
What? I need to ask her something.

163
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:58,414
Gosh. I don't have much time. Is she on the third floor?

164
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:01,184
What is it? Gosh.

165
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:02,852
Hello, Director.

166
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:06,055
I'm at the sauna.

167
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,658
I'm putting on my underwear now.

168
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:11,627
My right foot is going in right now.

169
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,096
I'll be right there.

170
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:14,864
Gosh.

171
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,134
What's with him?

172
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,337
Was someone here?

173
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:22,839
I think I heard Dong Gu's voice.

174
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,774
He was here, but he left right away.

175
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:26,476
He said he wanted to ask you something.

176
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:27,643
Me?

177
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,812
What could it be?

178
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,553
This is not even my first audition. Why am I so nervous?

179
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:41,390
I really want the role this time.

180
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,229
My fans' support might be able to...

181
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,364
cheer me up.

Is junki_love_ busy?

184
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:58,674
- Please come in. - Okay.

185
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,811
Don't be nervous.

186
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,046
Good luck. You can do this, right? Yes.

187
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:05,114
Okay.

188
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:10,753
Is the media supposed to cover up problems?

189
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:13,756
Are they supposed to distort the truth and manipulate the public?

190
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:14,991
The media should never...

191
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,693
distort or cover up the truth.

192
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,695
News programs should fear those without power...

193
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,864
and be feared by those with power.

194
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:22,965
That is...

195
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:25,835
a journalist's obligation and fate.

196
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:27,403
Do you understand?

197
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:34,243
That's all.

198
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:36,712
Thank you.

199
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,851
Well...

200
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:47,056
Thank you for giving me a chance to audition.

201
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:49,625
Hold on.

202
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,295
Do you like bean sprout soup?

203
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:53,796
Sorry?

204
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,265
I do.

205
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:59,068
Why don't we discuss your role over some bean sprout soup?

206
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:00,136
Pardon?

207
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,673
- What do you mean? - I liked your acting.

208
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:06,175
I was looking for a new face.

209
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:08,344
Are you sure?

00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:50,620
What? What's the matter?

213

Well... The thing is...

Thank you.

- Thank you so much. - Jun Ki, it's Dong Gu.

218
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,401
Dong Gu?

219
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:07,536
- Hi, Dong Gu. - Congratulations!

220
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,639
Good luck with your drama! You can do this!

221
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,274
Okay. Thank you.

222
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,209
I'll do my best.

223
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,243
Okay.

224
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:19,615

It's the director.

Hello, Director.

230
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:42,805
I'm in front of announcer Park Chang Ho's house.

231
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:45,875
Thank you for arranging this interview.

232
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,943
Okay.

233
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:50,112
I'll collect as much information as possible. Bye.

234
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,982
I'm nervous.

235
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:56,252
I can't believe I'll be interviewing Announcer Park Chang Ho.

237
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,196
Your place is big.

238
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:11,634
Ma'am, please take this.

239
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:13,936
Thank you.

240
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,545
- Oh, my. - What does he want for lunch?

241
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:25,681
He'll skip lunch because of the interview.

242
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:28,184
It must have been hard.

243
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,087
Take some vitamins,

244
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:32,688
and lie down.

245
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:34,790
Thank you, ma'am.

246
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,625
- Oh, my. - Are you okay?

247
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,235
You can go in.

248
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:49,238
- Okay. - By the way,

249
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:51,140
if he wants to see me,

250
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,075
please tell him I'm not home.

251
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,411
Tell him I went out.

252
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:58,814
I'd appreciate it if you could do that.

253
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:00,416
All right.

254
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,353
She's not here?

255
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:08,624
Excuse me.

256
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:20,002
Hello, sir.

257
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:23,506
I'm here to interview you. I'm Lee Jun Ki, an actor.

258
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:26,442
You're here. Give me a second.

259
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:31,013
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

260
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,314
Hello.

261
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,583
It's an honor to meet you.

262
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,486
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

263
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:41,357
Not at all. You're shooting a drama about announcers.

264
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:43,092
I'm more than willing to help.

265
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,994
- Please have a seat. - Okay.

266
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:50,933
Were you writing something?

267
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,869
I'm preparing an autobiography.

268
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,905
I was organizing my manuscripts.

269
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:59,508
It'll be about 20 volumes.

270
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,676
20 volumes?

271
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:04,547
You've been an announcer for such a long time.

272
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:06,315
I'm sure you have a lot to write about.

273
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:10,152
I've been trying to boil it down, but it's still a lot.

274
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,756
Should we get started?

275
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,558
(Interview Questions for Announcer Park Chang Ho)

276
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:19,195
I'd like to know what made you want to become an announcer.

277
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:23,232
What made me want to become an announcer?

278
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,570
I think it was 1987.

279
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,038
- Okay. - It was snowing.

280
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:33,275
It was probably December 12 or sometime around then.

281
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:35,144
Anyway, my family lived in a wooden house,

282
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:37,146
which was rare at that time.

283
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:40,516
It was built in a combination of Japanese and American styles.

284
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,584
I see.

285
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,185
The house had two rooms.

286
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:45,688
One room belonged to my mom, dad, me, my little brother,

287
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:48,424
and our two dogs, Bok Sil and Teun Sil.

288
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:50,826
The other room belonged to...

289
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:52,128
my three older sisters.

290
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,897
My family has had a tremendous impact on me.

291
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:57,600
Let me talk about my eldest sister first.

292
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,870
She was 170cm tall, which was pretty tall back then.

293
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,905
She weighed 48kg. She was quite thin.

294
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:06,075
Hold on. Why is he telling me all this?

295
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,043
Something's strange.

296
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:14,383
She's studying hard.

297
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,085
Soo Ah.

298
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:19,555
Drink this.

299
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:23,025
Can I check how far you've done?

300
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,894
What? You don't have to.

301
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:27,196
Come on. Are you worried you got some questions wrong?

302
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:28,731
Don't worry. Let me see.

303
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,299
It's okay.

304
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,234
It's really okay.

305
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:38,140
All the pages are empty.

306
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,743
What have you been doing all this time?

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,145

308
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:45,614
I suddenly remembered the old days.

309
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:48,384
I used to do this a lot on my textbooks.

310
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:51,387
I was going to study after this, I swear.

311
00:15:51,387 --> 00:15:54,290
It's okay. I used to do this a lot too.

312
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,491
Finish it.

313
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:58,294
Thank you. I'll be quick.

314
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:02,698
My eldest sister loved mung bean pancakes...

315
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,200
and kimchi pancakes.

316
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,135
She met a man who was doing research...

317
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,336
for a flour company.

318
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:09,838
They got married in the fall of 1973.

319
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,407
They have a son and two daughters.

320
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:13,609
They're living happily in Pennsylvania...

321
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,578
in a red-roofed house three blocks away...

322
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:17,446
from the post office.

323
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:18,714
I see.

324
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:19,715
Now,

325
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:22,151
let's move onto my second eldest sister.

326
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:23,419
She is...

327
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,854
162cm tall and weighs 50kg.

328
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:29,191
She has an oval-shaped face.

329
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:31,493
She loved poetry when she was young.

330
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:34,563
Her hobby was knitting, and...

331
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:37,666
Jun Ki.

332
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,435
Jun Ki.

333
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:42,004
Yes? What?

334
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:46,642
I'm sorry, sir.

335
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:50,546
Due to acting practice, I couldn't sleep much last night.

336
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:52,214
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

337
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:54,383
It could happen.

338
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,086
Sleep is resting in an unconscious state.

339
00:16:57,086 --> 00:16:58,821
It's a natural behavior.

340
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:01,824
Sleep. What is sleep?

341
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:03,959
To understand sleep,

342
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,862
it's necessary to look at Freud's theories of psychoanalysis.

343
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,397
In order to understand them,

344
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:10,466
one must know about Freud.

345
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:12,768
Freud's name is Sigmund Freud.

346
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:15,337
He was born in Pribor, Czech Republic in 1856, between...

347
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:19,708
Jacob Freud and his 2nd wife Amalia, who was 20 years younger than him.

348
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,077
The makeup of his family was very unique.

349
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:23,379
Seven of his siblings...

350
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:25,347
His family was quite poor.

351
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:28,817
When Freud was nine, he received the best...

352
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,552
He was dedicated to school... He was 17 years old.

353
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:32,488
It was built in...

354
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:36,125
It showed how academically talented Freud was.

355
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,132
Yoon Ah.

356
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,770
Dong Gu, what brings you here?

357
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,139
I had an errand to run in the neighborhood.

358
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,174
I happened to see you.

359
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,444
- Did you just finish class? - Yes.

360
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,780
What's wrong with your face?

361
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,715
Your eyes are so red.

362
00:18:00,249 --> 00:18:02,351
- Did you not sleep well? - That's not it.

363
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:05,688
My eyes get red easily.

364
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:06,855
I'm okay.

365
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,060
I heard that you were looking for me yesterday.

366
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,595
I heard you wanted to ask me something.

367
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:15,364
Oh, right.

368
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:18,033
When will THAAD issues be resolved?

369
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,368
Pardon?

370
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:22,538
You rejected me five seconds after I confessed to you,

371
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:24,873
but we're still both Koreans.

372
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,676
We can discuss international relations issues.

373
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:28,911
That's true,

374
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,613
but I'm not familiar with those issues...

375
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:36,885
Are you hungry?

376
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:45,094
What you craved was just sundae?

377
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:48,464
Yes, it's my favorite food.

378
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:51,533
Dong Gu, are you really okay?

379
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,569
You look very tired.

380
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:54,770
No, I am not.

381
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,741
People often tell me that I look tired.

382
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,410
How about you?

383
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,011
Is the class fun?

384
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,013
Yes, it's so much fun.

385
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,982
I also like my classmates.

386
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:11,320
We learned how to bake a cake today.

387
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:13,355
Dong Gu?

388
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,425
Dong Gu?

389
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:19,661
- Yes, what is it? - Did you just fall asleep?

390
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:22,865
No, I was thinking.

391
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:25,701
"Should I dip sundae in salt..."

392
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,336
"or pickled shrimp?"

393
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:28,704
Here's your sundae.

394
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:30,873
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

395
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:32,474
It looks so delicious.

396
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,309
Let's see.

397
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:37,012
Try some.

398
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:42,151
- Dong Gu? - Yes?

399
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:43,986
What is it?

400
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:47,489
I wasn't sleeping. I was praying.

401
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:48,957
You don't usually pray.

402
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:50,592
I do before eating snack food...

403
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,294
especially sundae.

404
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,001
I was hungry.

405
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,905
It's so delicious.

406
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:04,840
Isn't it, Dong Gu?

407
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,074
As such, Society of Jesus is based on Catholicism at risk.

408
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,911
Goodness, I digressed from the topic of sleep.

409
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:47,149
There's more to say, but I'll skip it.

410
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:48,383
Let's go back to the main topic.

411
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:50,419
She loved me, and her hobby was knitting.

412
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:53,055
I'll finish the story of my second eldest sister.

413
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:54,490
My second eldest sister...

414
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:57,860
Jun Ki?

415
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,995
- Jun Ki. - Yes.

416
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:04,566
I was listening about Freud's psychoanalysis.

417
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:09,104
I talked about it 20 hours ago.

418
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:12,374
- You must be very tired. - 20 hours?

419
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,245
I'm sorry, sir.

420
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:26,255
What would you like for lunch, sir?

421
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:29,024
Just choose among meat, fish, salad, and porridge.

422
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:30,225
Just choose.

423
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:34,429
I studied everything about food in the encyclopedia.

424
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:38,066
Just choose one, please?

425
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:43,305
Please I beg you.

426
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,715
Okay.

427
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,152
- Jun Ki, what would you like? - Pardon?

428
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,354
I...

429
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:02,324
I'll eat meat.

430
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,693
Meat?

431
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,094
Which meat?

432
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:08,497
Pork? Beef? Mutton? Chicken?

433
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:10,399
I'd like pork.

434
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:13,101
Pork? That's a good choice.

435
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:14,469
Shall we go then?

436
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,274
Wait.

437
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:23,545
A certain body type is necessary to eat pork.

438
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:27,015
What's your body type?

439
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,984
According to Heo Jun's "Mirror of Eastern Medicine",

440
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:31,920
eating food according to one's body type is very important.

441
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:35,991
We must learn about Heo Jun who wrote "Mirror of Eastern Medicine".

442
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,327
Heo Jun was a court physician during the Joseon Dynasty.

443
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:41,763
He was the 20th generation of the Yangcheon Heo clan.

444
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:44,132
He learned how to read and write at an early age.

445
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:46,168
He was talented in various academic fields.

446
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:49,938
He was especially interested in Eastern philosophy...

447
00:22:49,938 --> 00:22:52,474
such as Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.

448
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:54,576
Based on these teachings,

449
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:58,513
he wrote a book called "Mirror of Eastern Medicine".

450
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,215
Heo Jun...

451
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:05,354
- I can't believe it. - Soo Ah.

452
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,055
Are you still eating?

453
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:08,256
Yes, why?

454
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,993
I thought you'd come back after eating, but it's been two hours.

455
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:13,095
Soo Ah, it's time to study.

456
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,367
No one should bother anyone who's eating.

457
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,035
Aren't you being too harsh?

458
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:23,438
I can't study if I'm hungry.

459
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:24,539
Really?

460
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,441
I'm sorry. I wasn't thoughtful enough.

461
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,210
Keep eating. Be comfortable.

462
00:23:29,478 --> 00:23:30,746
I'm back.

463
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,784
What? Where have you been?

464
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:38,153
- Park Chang Ho's interview. - What?

465
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:40,856
Didn't you go there yesterday? Did you just finish?

466
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:42,557
What kind of interview is two days long?

467
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:43,825
Exactly.

468
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:47,262
I've never seen anyone as talkative as he was.

469
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:51,233
He lectured me on the history of prehistoric times for lunch.

470
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:55,570
- Hello, everyone. - Yoon Ah.

471
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:57,339
- Have you had dinner? - Yes.

472
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:00,075
I bumped into Dong Gu, so we ate together.

473
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:02,544
Sol must be awake.

474
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,415
She ate with Dong Gu?

475
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:09,284
He went to Sokcho for a few days for location scouting.

476
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:12,120
Really? Then why is he back?

477
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,436
Hello? Yes, Director.

478
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:28,770
Why are you so late?

479
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,773
- Where are you? - I'm at the sauna.

480
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,009
I'm wearing my underwear.

481
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,178
My right leg is going in.

482
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:38,780
I'll leave as soon as I put on my pants.

483
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,150
I'll keep my shirt off. I love you.

484
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:48,390
He'll scold me a lot when I get there.

485
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,263
It's fine as long as I saw Yoon Ah.

486
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:10,011
- Soo Ah. - May I come in?

487
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,346
Of course.

488
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,815
Look who's here.

489
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:17,586
- Do you have something to say? - No.

490
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:19,721
What did you eat with Dong Gu?

491
00:25:19,888 --> 00:25:22,624
- We ate sundae. - I see.

492
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:24,926
Did Dong Gu go back to Sokcho?

493
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:26,161
Sokcho?

494
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:27,829
Did he go to Sokcho?

495
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:31,633
You didn't know? He went to Sokcho for his movie.

496
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,935
I wondered why he came back.

497
00:25:34,102 --> 00:25:35,704
It was to see you.

498
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:38,006
Pardon? What do you mean?

499
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:41,710
Do you think he came all the way back to Seoul for sundae?

500
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,880
Dong Gu is immature,

501
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,381
and he has no talent.

502
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:48,583
His future isn't clear.

503
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,752
Still, he's a good person.

504
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:53,755
He's nice and has a lot of affection.

505
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:55,123
He's also warm.

506
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:57,392
I'm just saying.

507
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:59,060
Have a good night.

508
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,898
By the way, do you like the coat that I gave you?

509
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:05,934
Yes, it's pretty and warm.

510
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:07,469
Thank you.

511
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:09,337
You should thank Dong Gu.

512
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:11,973
He bought that coat for you.

513
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:13,275
What?

514
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:16,444
You didn't know, did you?

515
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:18,213
I thought you already knew.

516
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:22,284
Don't tell Dong Gu that I told you.

517
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:23,552
Okay?

518
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:41,770
Why doesn't junki_love_ post comments these days?

519
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:44,639
I wonder if something's wrong.

520
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:49,211
Shall I send a message?

521
00:26:50,412 --> 00:26:52,614
She might be surprised to hear from me.

522
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:54,482
(Sending message to junki_love_)

523
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:55,984
"Hello."

524
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,620
"This is Lee Jun Ki."

525
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,990
"Are you all right?"

526
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,292
Add a question mark. Done.

527
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,461
(Hello, this is Lee Jun Ki. Are you all right?)

528
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:09,231
What was that?

529
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,733
Where did that sound come from?

530
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:17,505
Gosh. Seo Jin is so clumsy. She forgot to take her cell phone again.

531
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:19,875
I'm sure she'll make a fuss, wondering where she left it.

532
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,309
She sure is clumsy.

533
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:23,845
What is this?

534
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:25,447
(Hello, this is Lee Jun Ki. Are you all right?)

535
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:26,448
Junki_love_?

536
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:27,449
(Hello, this is Lee Jun Ki. Are you all right?)

537
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:28,583
What's going on?

538
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:40,462
What is it?

539
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:42,631
Why are you coming in without my permission?

540
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:43,832
Seo Jin.

541
00:27:47,602 --> 00:27:48,904
How do you explain this?

542
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:53,241
Were you the one who wrote the comments all along?

543
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,079
- Why did you do it? - Why do you think I did it?

544
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,290
I'm a bit busy right now. If you don't mind, please leave.

545
00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:48,263
Soo Ah. How much longer are you going to watch television?

546
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,864
You watched this drama earlier.

547
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:52,867
Gosh. You sure are acting strict.

548
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:54,869
All right. I'll turn it off.

549
00:28:56,972 --> 00:28:58,807
- What do you want me to do? - What?

550
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:00,942
Shall we study math?

551
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:02,010
Math?

552
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,778
That's my weakest subject.

553
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:06,915
That's all right. We'll start with the basics, so don't worry.

554
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,885
Then why don't we try solving this problem?

555
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:14,723
Here.

556
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,926
Hey. Are you kidding me?

557
00:29:17,926 --> 00:29:20,795
I may not know the basics, but do you think I wouldn't know this?

558
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,065
- The answer's 40, right? - What?

559
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,069
Soo Ah. How could the answer be 40?

560
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:29,637
If you add 8 to 12, that's 20.

561
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,673
Then you multiply that by 2, so it's 40, right?

562
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,942
Soo Ah. You see,

563
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:35,744
if you have to multiply or divide,

564
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:37,846
you have to do it before adding or subtracting.

565
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:39,848
So you multiply 8 and 2 first,

566
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:41,750
and afterwards, you add 12.

567
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,486
What? Why do you have to multiply first?

568
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,623
There are priorities in the four fundamental arithmetic operations.

569
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:51,393
Even if it comes after, you must multiply or divide first.

570
00:29:51,393 --> 00:29:53,762
Who says so?

571
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:56,297
Well, I don't know who made that rule.

572
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,233
What? Then are you...

573
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,802
trying to teach me when you don't even know who made that rule?

574
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:03,271
Why do I have to learn something you don't even know?

575
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:06,474
I can't believe this.

576
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:09,110
Who is he trying to teach when he doesn't even know anything?

577
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,679
He acted like he knew everything. Whom is he trying to kid?

578
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,049
If I have to calculate it first, it should be in the front.

579
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,517
Why make up a problem like that?

580
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:17,218
Are you trying to irritate me or what?

581
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:19,454
Do I have to question your character?

582
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:21,489
Hey, do you know that...

583
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:23,725
I'm actually having doubts about fundamental rules of math?

584
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,744
Did you ask if I know Du Shik?

585
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:46,314
He was the most positive man I knew.

586
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:49,751
Are you wondering what happened to that Du Shik who was so positive?

587
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:51,453
Hey, you bonehead.

588
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:54,456
How dare you doubt math when you have no idea at all?

589
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:56,624
Quit studying if you're going to behave like this.

590
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:58,560
If you're not smart enough, you should at least be diligent.

591
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,727
Is this the time to be watching dramas?

592
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:01,329
Can you even understand the lines in the drama?

593
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,398
You bonehead. Hey, hey, hey.

594
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:05,934
Did you bring up character? Who are you to bring that up?

595
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:07,335
I thought I'd help you out because I felt sorry for you.

596
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:10,205
You fool. You bonehead. Did you really graduate school?

597
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:13,741
Gosh. You're a complete bonehead. My goodness. You complete fool.

598
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:20,315
Jun Ki. Then I'll see you on the day of the shooting.

599
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,083
I'll see you then, sir.

600
00:31:22,117 --> 00:31:23,284
Thank you!

601
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,325
Seo Jin.

602
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:32,827
Were you the one who wrote the comments all along?

603
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:35,296
- Why did you do it? - Why do you think I did it?

604
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:42,437
(junki_love_'s account)

605
00:31:42,437 --> 00:31:45,540
I'm so crazy about "Octopus Man" these days.

606
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:49,310
I know you'll become a big star one day.

607
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,779
You may not have any lines, but you're still charming.

608
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,215
You may only appear briefly, but you have a strong presence.

609
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:56,084
Your performance is the best.

610
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:58,753
I have faith in you. Keep up the good work.

611
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:02,924
- Jun Ki. - You startled me.

612
00:32:02,924 --> 00:32:04,592
Congratulations on getting the part.

613
00:32:04,592 --> 00:32:06,628
I'm really happy for you.

614
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:08,796
I owe it all to you. Thank you.

615
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:10,031
What did you say?

616
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:12,267
I just thanked you.

617
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:14,903
No, I should be thanking you.

618
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:17,939
After all, you introduced me to Seo Jin.

619
00:32:18,072 --> 00:32:20,175
As a matter of fact,

620
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:22,110
I'm going on a date with her today.

621
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,179
What? A date?

622
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,182
Yes. I expressed my feelings to her a few days ago.

623
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:29,417
She said she wants to meet me today.

624
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,519
This means she has feelings for me too, right?

625
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:34,022
Thank you so much, Jun Ki.

626
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:36,824
I'll ask you one more time.

627
00:32:38,092 --> 00:32:41,029
Do you not consider me a woman?

628
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,465
I see you as a man.

629
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,534
What should I do?

630
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:51,472
- Surprise. - You look great.

631
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:55,276
Cheer up.

632
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:58,713
Congratulations, Chewbacca. Treat us to a meal on your payday.

633
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:01,416
You may slack off at times, but you do know how to act.

634
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:03,251
I like you.

635
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:08,089
- Jae Woo - What is it?

636
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,457
You won't be able to meet Seo Jin today.

637
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:12,093
- What? Why not? - I think I'll regret this.

638
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:14,562
Regret what? What are you talking about?

639
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:16,164
If I lose Seo Jin now,

640
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,533
I think I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

641
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,335
What?

642
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,470
If you didn't hear me, never mind.

643
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,286
What is it? Why are you here?

644
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:40,755
Seo Jin. We need to talk.

645
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:51,132
What is it? Why are you here?

646
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:53,635
Seo Jin. We need to talk.

647
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:55,270
I have nothing to say to you.

648
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,109
I'll try.

649
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,077
What is that supposed to mean?

650
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:04,579
I'll try to look at you...

651
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:06,614
as a woman from now on.

652
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,884
So...

653
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:11,719
let's start dating...

654
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:13,988
as man and woman.

655
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,891
Jun Ki.

656
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:26,934
Jun Ki.

657
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:30,305
We need to keep this a secret from Dong Gu.

658
00:34:30,305 --> 00:34:32,040
- All right. - If he finds out we're dating,

659
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,108
he'll beat me to death. Do you understand me?

660
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:35,643
All right. I get it.

661
00:34:39,147 --> 00:34:41,149
Let go of me. People are looking at us.

662
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:42,850
No. I'm not letting go of you.

663
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:44,752
I'll never let go of you.

664
00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:55,029
Hello.

665
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:00,068
- Welcome. - Welcome.

666
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:02,337
- Seo Jin. Show them to their rooms. - All right.

667
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:03,738
- Hello. - Welcome.

668
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,273
Jun Ki.

669
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:08,609
Please follow me.

670
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:12,780
- Come in. Come in. - Please follow me.

671
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:15,683
I didn't know what to do. There's been a problem at my place.

672
00:35:15,683 --> 00:35:17,085
I owe you all.

673
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,854
We should be thanking you. After all, you've brought us guests.

674
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:21,589
I heard you'll be staying here as well.

675
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:23,691
That's right. You see, I have to show them around.

676
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,460
- Then follow me. - Okay.

677
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:36,104
Why? What is it?

678
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:40,241
Jun Ki. You remember we have a date later, right?

679
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:41,542
Yes, of course.

680
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:44,145
Then we're going on our first date today.

681
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,214
I'm looking forward to it.

682
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:49,417
What... What are you doing? Someone might see us.

683
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:52,220
Why do you care? No one's here anyway.

684
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,055
Really?

685
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:56,090
I'm home.

686
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:02,530
You... You're home.

687
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:04,465
Did you come straight home from Sokcho?

688
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:07,502
Gosh, I'm so tired.

689
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,270
Why are you two together?

690
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:10,805
I warned you.

691
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:12,974
I told you not to go anywhere near my sister.

692
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:15,009
- Where's my stick? - It's... It's not like that.

693
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:17,879
I met her by accident while going to the dining room to drink water.

694
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,113
That's right.

695
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:20,314
Really?

696
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:23,050
What are you doing there?

697
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:25,753
I... I'm... I'm just cleaning.

698
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,422
There is so much hair on the floor.

699
00:36:27,488 --> 00:36:28,656
Gosh.

700
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:30,224
- Really? - So much hair.

701
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:32,693
What... What is that? Is that for me?

702
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:36,964
This? This is the famous semi-dried squid from Sokcho.

703
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:39,267
They're the same species as you.

704
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:41,602
These are squids, and so are you. Squid!

705
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,604
- What did you just say? - Your friend.

706
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,073
What is that sound?

707
00:36:47,475 --> 00:36:49,977
Yoon Ah's teacher, Hyun Joon,

708
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,512
brought his friend.

709
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:52,880
He's going to stay here for a few days.

710
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,149
Song Hyun Joon is staying here?

711
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:56,417
Gosh!

712
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:58,319
What are you doing?

713
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:02,023
Oh, my. Are you all right?

714
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,257
Are you hurt?

715
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:04,759
I'm fine.

716
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:09,730
It's so beautifully decorated and nice.

717
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,666
I'm happy you like it.

718
00:37:13,468 --> 00:37:17,271
Oh, my! Who is this?

719
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:19,407
Dong Gu, when did you come home?

720
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:20,508
Just now.

721
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:22,176
We get to meet again.

722
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:25,613
I heard you're going to stay here for a few days.

723
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:27,515
Yes, I'll stay here for a few days.

724
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:30,284
But there are so many other guesthouses.

725
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:32,987
Why did you come here?

726
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:35,590
It's nice to go somewhere with people I know.

727
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:37,258
Yoon Ah is here too.

728
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:41,229
Oh, I see.

729
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:43,364
Dong Gu, what's that?

730
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:44,866
This?

731
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:48,069
This is semi-dried squid I bought in Sokcho.

732
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:50,771
They're the same species as Hyun Joon.

733
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:53,941
Well,

734
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,710
do you want one?

735
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,846
This is a welcome gift...

736
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:01,182
to celebrate on your stay here.

737
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:02,950
Sure.

738
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:17,498
(Life-and-Death Situation)

739
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:28,576
Jun Ki, I'm going home now.

740
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:31,279
Get dressed and come outside. I miss you!

741
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,548
Gosh, I can't get used to this.

742
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:35,449
Gosh.

743
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,486
I didn't know I would go out with Seo Jin.

744
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:47,728
Right.

745
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:52,099
She was such a small child with a beard.

746
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,802
I didn't know I'd ever go on dates with her.

747
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:57,838
This is unbelievable. Unbelievable.

748
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,575
No. No.

749
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,810
But we started dating.

750
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:04,478
Let's give this a try.

751
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:07,815
Let's give this a try. Let's go!

752
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:09,350
Follow me.

753
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:14,288
They were like family to me when I studied in New York.

754
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:18,559
We'd go on trips during our vacations.

755
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,529
Really? It must have been fun.

756
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,601
Why doesn't this open?

757
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,170
Dong Gu, will you open this for me?

758
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:30,504
All right.

759
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:37,945
Can't you open it?

760
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,085
It doesn't open. It must be broken.

761
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:47,355
- I'll try. - It doesn't work.

762
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:48,723
This lid is stuck...

763
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,929
- Oh, my. - Hyun Joon, you're really strong.

764
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,864
It was easy to open.

765
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:59,467
Hyun Joon, should we grab a drink?

766
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:00,768
Okay. Sure.

767
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:03,304
Yoon Ah, we're going to grab a drink. Do you want to join us?

768
00:40:03,304 --> 00:40:06,941
You shouldn't say that to someone who is breastfeeding.

769
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:10,878
Dong Gu, Sol started eating powdered milk recently.

770
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:11,946
Really?

771
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:14,582
But it's too late to drink.

772
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:16,117
It's only 9pm.

773
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:18,786
Yoon Ah, Sol is asleep, so you should go and play.

774
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:20,688
I'll clean this up.

775
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:22,223
- Would that be okay? - Yes.

776
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,292
It's just for one day.

777
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:28,129
I want to drink too.

778
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:30,665
I feel like having a drink.

779
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:32,667
You must be good at drinking.

780
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,902
I'm not a bad drinker.

781
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:37,972
- How about you? - I'm not a bad drinker myself.

782
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:40,107
Do you want to join us?

783
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,342
Let's go.

784
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:49,617
(Announcer Park Chang Ho)

785
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,053
Why is he calling me?

786
00:40:55,056 --> 00:40:57,525
Hello. How have you been?

787
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:59,293
Are you doing well, Jun Ki?

788
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:01,462
I have so many things I want to tell you.

789
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:02,930
I was wondering why you didn't come.

790
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,165
What?

791
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,368
I'm a little busy nowadays.

792
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:08,469
I see.

793
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:11,639
But why does your voice seem so far away?

794
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,142
My phone is a little old.

795
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,078
Really?

796
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:19,847
But it's so nice to have a phone at all.

797
00:41:19,914 --> 00:41:21,082
Jun Ki,

798
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:24,185
- do you know how phones were made? - What?

799
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:28,022
To know about the history of phones, you need to know about telephones.

800
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:31,425
A telephone was first invented in Havana, Cuba in 1949...

801
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:33,961
by an Italian named Antonio Meucci.

802
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:35,563
We normally think that...

803
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:39,200
The first model...1873... Alexander Graham...

804
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,068
Alexander...British Royal...

805
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:45,005
In London...Graham...

806
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,807
He started...fixed the exteriors...

807
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:49,510
Gramophone...so as to help...

808
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:54,248
In that case, how did smart phones first come to be?

809
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:57,118
The first smart phone that was developed in 1992...

810
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:59,620
- by IBM called Simon... - Jun Ki, I'm here.

811
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,722
- To find out about Simon, - What are you doing?

812
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:04,759
- you need to know about IBM. - Just wait a moment.

813
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,794
- IBM... - Sir.

814
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:10,097
I'm so thankful for the explanation,

815
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:14,368
but I need to go in for a shoot. Yes.

816
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:16,604
I'll call you later.

817
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:19,240
Sure. Bye.

818
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:23,010
Gosh, my ear hurts.

819
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:24,411
Who was it?

820
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:27,915
It was Announcer Park Chang Ho.

821
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,351
The talkative one?

822
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:33,954
I haven't seen him for a while, so he's torturing me with calls.

823
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,690
I might need to block his number.

824
00:42:39,527 --> 00:42:41,629
I'm sorry. Let's go.

825
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:42,963
The film will begin soon.

826
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,966
Jun Ki, let's have popcorn. Yes?

827
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:50,571
- What's wrong? - It's nothing.

828
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:52,807
Let's have popcorn.

829
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,443
Otherwise, you go native.

830
00:42:56,443 --> 00:42:57,611
That's right.

831
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,859
Why are there so many kissing scenes in the movie?

832
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:14,728
Gosh, I'm already feeling awkward as it is.

833
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:23,637
Why? Don't you like it?

834
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,440
No, it's nothing.

835
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:30,211
Gosh, it's so awkward.

836
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:32,213
It's driving me crazy.

837
00:43:32,913 --> 00:43:34,148
No.

838
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,383
You shouldn't think like this.

839
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:38,786
She's not that hairy kid from the past.

840
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:41,288
She's an adult now. An adult.

841
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:46,360
What is this? Why is her hand so small?

842
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:48,762
Was it always this small?

843
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,535
Oh, my.

844
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,371
What's wrong?

845
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:00,975
What are you staring at?

846
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:02,610
Why?

847
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,511
Do I have a beard again?

848
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:06,714
No, it's not that.

849
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:09,583
I get it. Am I too pretty?

850
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:12,753
Do you want to stare at me even though I'm next to you?

851
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:16,891
Gosh, you like me so much.

852
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,968
I'm so sad it's over.

853
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:31,438
Jun Ki, I had so much fun today.

854
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:33,073
Yes.

855
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,642
Sleep tight...

856
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,078
and dream about me.

857
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:47,321
Oh gosh. I still can't get used to this.

858
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:51,592
What... What's this?

859
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:53,594
- Gosh. - Stop it.

860
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:57,197
Get a hold of yourself.

861
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,666
Why did you drink so much?

862
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,801
Let me go.

863
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:04,505
I'm going to drink more.

864
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,142
What's this? What's wrong with him?

865
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:11,378
He had a bet with Hyun Joon, and he got drunk.

866
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:13,747
I'm sorry. He kept saying he was all right.

867
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:15,683
Mr. Kang, wake up.

868
00:45:15,683 --> 00:45:16,984
Hey!

869
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:19,787
What are you doing?

870
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:23,791
You promised to call me Dong Gu.

871
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:27,594
Call me Dong Gu. Dong Gu.

872
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,430
All right, Dong Gu.

873
00:45:29,797 --> 00:45:31,098
Wake up.

874
00:45:31,098 --> 00:45:32,866
All right. I will.

875
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:35,302
No!

876
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,941
You promised to make me sausage bread. Don't forget!

877
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:44,745
I love sausage buns.

878
00:45:45,713 --> 00:45:47,681
Okay, I'll put two sausages.

879
00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:48,849
Two?

880
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:49,984
Two sausages?

881
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:51,452
How much did he drink?

882
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:53,287
Sorry. I'll take him inside.

883
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:55,222
- Sausages... - Pull yourself together. Let's go.

884
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:58,092
- Take him away. - Hey! Du Shik!

885
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:08,369
Gosh, it smells like vitamins.

886
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:10,404
How many vitamin pills did he take?

887
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:13,240
Gosh, it smells like red ginseng.

888
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,942
Seriously, what did he eat?

889
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:17,111
Gosh, what's the noise? My head aches.

890
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,480
I feel terrible.

891
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,714
Are you waking up now?

892
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:22,483
That brat.

893
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:23,784
Gosh, I feel nauseous.

894
00:46:24,718 --> 00:46:27,287
Why are you wiping the floor?

895
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:30,691
What is this?

896
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:33,560
Where are my clothes?

897
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,561
Who took them off?

898
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:35,796
We did. Do you have a problem?

899
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,664
- Why? - Hey.

900
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:40,534
You wet yourself last night.

901
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:42,069
What? Me?

902
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:43,637
It doesn't end there.

903
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:45,305
You said Hyun Joon and you were brothers now.

904
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:46,774
You hugged and kissed him.

905
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:48,542
It was disgusting.

906
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:49,710
"Brothers"?

907
00:46:49,877 --> 00:46:51,845
That jerk? Me?

908
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:53,047
Hyun Joon.

909
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:54,181
Hey.

910
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:55,616
I kissed you.

911
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:56,950
I was already worried...

912
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,919
when you were drinking too much to beat Hyun Joon.

913
00:46:58,919 --> 00:47:00,587
Why do you care so much about him?

914
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:02,356
What do you think?

915
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:05,059
Yoon Ah is getting close to him,

916
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,560
so you feel jealous of him, right?

917
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,730
He's not over Yoon Ah yet.

918
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,931
That's not true.

919
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:13,100
I'm not interested in her anymore.

920
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,535
Really?

921
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:15,736
Then I guess...

922
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:17,404
I can tell Yoon Ah that you wet yourself.

923
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:19,273
Okay. Yoon Ah!

924
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:21,942
Jun Ki! Stop it.

925
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,310
Stop it.

926
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,712
Stop it right now.

927
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:28,582
Why? You're not interested in Yoon Ah anyway.

928
00:47:29,817 --> 00:47:32,252
Fine. I still like her. What's wrong with that?

929
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:33,520
No matter how hard I try,

930
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,090
I keep thinking about her and missing her.

931
00:47:36,557 --> 00:47:38,826
So that's why you care so much about Hyun Joon.

932
00:47:38,826 --> 00:47:40,561
That jerk has been...

933
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:43,097
hovering around Yoon Ah. It's bothering me.

934
00:47:43,097 --> 00:47:44,364
Why would that bother you?

935
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,600
Nothing seemed to be going on between those two.

936
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,801
You think so?

937
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:50,571
Something doesn't feel right.

938
00:47:50,971 --> 00:47:53,040
Something smells fishy.

939
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,843
The smell is from your blankets.

940
00:47:55,843 --> 00:47:57,811
Wash your blankets right now. They stink!

941
00:47:57,811 --> 00:47:59,146
Fine.

942
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:00,814
What is this?

943
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:08,088
Du Shik.

944
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:11,592
Don't tell Yoon Ah I wet my bed.

945
00:48:11,592 --> 00:48:12,893
All right.

946
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:14,428
By the way,

947
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:16,630
did I really say...

948
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,700
Hyun Joon and I were brothers?

949
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,934
Yes.

950
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:23,504
You acted like you found your missing brother.

951
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:24,638
You should quit drinking.

952
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:26,740
Gosh, I must have been crazy.

953
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:28,108
You're up.

954
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:30,277
Are you feeling all right?

955
00:48:30,277 --> 00:48:31,778
Yes, I'm okay.

956
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:34,448
How are you going to face Yoon Ah now?

957
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:35,916
Why?

958
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,284
Did I do something?

959
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:39,853
You lifted up Yoon Ah with your hands and feet last night.

960
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:41,388
What are you talking about?

961
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,624
We're in Hawaii now.

962
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:47,528
Dong Gu, that's enough.

963
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:50,230
Let's fly to Paris.

964
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:54,201
We're experiencing turbulence.

965
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:58,505
But Dong Gu is strong.

966
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:00,541
Here we go!

967
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:03,510
After Yoon Ah said she's never been abroad,

968
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:06,213
you lifted her up while saying you'd fly her.

969
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:08,081
What? I did that?

970
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:10,584
Yoon Ah won't have to travel abroad anymore.

971
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:12,586
You're pathetic.

972
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:18,725
Dong Gu.

973
00:49:20,661 --> 00:49:22,963
- You're up. - Yes.

974
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:25,132
Dong Gu, are you feeling all right?

975
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:26,867
Yes, I am,

976
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:28,435
Mr. Song.

977
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:30,304
What's with you?

978
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,306
We're brothers now, remember?

979
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:34,541
Are we?

980
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:37,477
I don't remember a thing.

981
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:40,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Song.

982
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:43,750
Don't worry, Mr. Kang.

983
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:53,694
Yoon Ah, we'll go upstairs.

984
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:55,128
Okay.

985
00:49:56,763 --> 00:49:59,833
Go upstairs, Mr. Song.

986
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:03,904
Yoon Ah, I'm sorry about yesterday.

987
00:50:03,904 --> 00:50:05,372
I was too drunk.

988
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:08,575
No problem. I enjoyed the flight.

989
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:15,115
Gosh. I'm crazy.

990
00:50:15,749 --> 00:50:17,918
Hyun Joon, show me how to do it.

991
00:50:17,951 --> 00:50:19,953
Okay. Just watch, and learn.

992
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:30,564
Hyun Joon, you're so good at this game.

993
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:34,234
That's not how you do it.

994
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:37,471
What? What do you mean?

995
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:41,642
When you play gonggi, it's important how you pick up the stones.

996
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:43,677
You should pick them up lightly.

997
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:46,947
If you do it so roughly, you'll make mistakes.

998
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,582
Are you good at gonggi too?

999
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:49,916
Of course.

1000
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,352
I'm the gonggi champion of Huam-dong.

1001
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,788
Do you want to see?

1002
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:58,425
All right. Give them to me.

1003
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:04,665
Like this. Lightly.

1004
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,136
Like this.

1005
00:51:09,836 --> 00:51:11,605
You're very good.

1006
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:13,640
It's nothing.

1007
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:17,577
Hyun Joon, your skills didn't look bad either.

1008
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:20,080
Why don't we compete?

1009
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,248
Just for fun.

1010
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,252
Well, why not?

1011
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:27,454
But it'd be boring if there's no reward.

1012
00:51:27,454 --> 00:51:29,856
The loser takes 10 hits to his forehead.

1013
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,224
Deal?

1014
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:35,395
Sure. How many points?

1015
00:51:35,962 --> 00:51:37,931
- 50? - That's too little.

1016
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:41,101
I say 100 points.

1017
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:43,036
Like a man.

1018
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,472
Let's decide who will attack first.

1019
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:46,740
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1020
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:50,143
My goodness. It's paper.

1021
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:52,779
I'll start first.

1022
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:05,292
That's 100 points.

1023
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,693
I win, Dong Gu.

1024
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:10,897
Hyun Joon, you're amazing.

1025
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:15,702
Too bad I have a hangover.

1026
00:52:15,702 --> 00:52:17,537
You're lucky.

1027
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:18,805
You think so?

1028
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:20,474
Let's just say so.

1029
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,242
"Let's just say so?"

1030
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:25,612
Are you saying I would have lost even if I didn't have a hangover?

1031
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:27,514
That's not what I meant.

1032
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:28,949
Then why don't we play another round?

1033
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:30,283
100 points again.

1034
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:33,286
The loser takes 20 hits to his forehead this time.

1035
00:52:33,453 --> 00:52:34,688
Sure.

1036
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:40,827
Hold on. Gosh.

1037
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:42,996
Hello, sir.

1038
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:45,332
Right now?

1039
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,368
Okay. I'll be right there.

1040
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:52,239
I have some work to do right now.

1041
00:52:52,606 --> 00:52:55,275
Let's play another round when I'm back.

1042
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:58,545
Hold on, Dong Gu.

1043
00:52:59,212 --> 00:53:01,181
I think you forgot something.

1044
00:53:01,248 --> 00:53:03,517
What? What do you mean?

1045
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:14,394
Who would have imagined Shin Hyun Joon would say yes...

1046
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:15,629
to the Saudi spy role?

1047
00:53:15,629 --> 00:53:16,630
Exactly.

1048
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,532
He seemed excited.

1049
00:53:18,632 --> 00:53:20,600
He probably thought it sounded fun.

1050
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,804
He wouldn't have expected an Arab role.

1051
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,472
It's all thanks to Dong Gu.

1052
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:28,074
We're done casting Shin Hyun Joon...

1053
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:29,910
and the location scouting.

1054
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,445
We only need props now.

1055
00:53:31,511 --> 00:53:33,713
What kind of gun should the main character carry around?

1056
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:34,981
What about a Beretta or a Smith and Wesson?

1057
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:37,050
That sounds boring.

1058
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:39,186
I want something new.

1059
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,255
Dong Gu.

1060
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:43,790
Do you have any ideas?

1061
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:46,960
Gonggi!

1062
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,895
Gosh. Gonggi?

1063
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:51,064
- What do you mean? - What?

1064
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:53,099
An air gun?

1065
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,401
That's interesting.

1066
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,436
- Dong Gu. - Yes?

1067
00:53:56,436 --> 00:53:58,438
You're full of ideas.

1068
00:53:58,939 --> 00:54:00,841
You've done enough today. You can go home.

1069
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:03,710
What? Okay.

1070
00:54:33,874 --> 00:54:36,343
- Who are you? - Hello.

1071
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:38,144
I'm Kang Dong Gu.

1072
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:40,680
I graduated from Hankook University, class of 2009.

1073
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:44,417
You and I were in the same film club, Ready, Go,

1074
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:45,852
back then.

1075
00:54:45,886 --> 00:54:47,821
Oh, you're Dong Gu.

1076
00:54:48,488 --> 00:54:50,023
What brings you here?

1077
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:54,628
How long has it been?

1078
00:54:55,595 --> 00:54:58,365
I haven't seen you since graduation.

1079
00:54:58,532 --> 00:55:00,066
What's the matter?

1080
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:04,704
I have a favor to ask.

1081
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:07,173
A favor? What is it?

1082
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:08,441
Do you remember...

1083
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:11,778
the university festival?

1084
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:13,146
The university festival?

1085
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,649
We had a movie screening.

1086
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:17,217
Was it a movie by Jean-Luc Godard?

1087
00:55:17,217 --> 00:55:18,385
That's not what I'm talking about.

1088
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:20,020
Well, we had a bar too.

1089
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,288
Not that either.

1090
00:55:21,288 --> 00:55:22,489
Then what is it?

1091
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:24,491
The gonggi competition.

1092
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:27,093
- What? - You represented our club...

1093
00:55:27,093 --> 00:55:28,228
and became the champion.

1094
00:55:28,228 --> 00:55:29,529
You finished 100 points...

1095
00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:30,897
within a record-breaking time.

1096
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:34,100
I did. I remember now.

1097
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:35,769
But what about it?

1098
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,438
Please teach me gonggi.

1099
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:40,740
What? Are you saying...

1100
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,343
you came here to learn gonggi after eight years?

1101
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:45,912
Yes, I have a situation.

1102
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:48,748
I must learn gonggi. I really want to play it well.

1103
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:52,018
I beg you, please?

1104
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,587
Please.

1105
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:55,922
What's wrong with you?

1106
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:06,700
Did you bring the stones?

1107
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:19,613
The weight should be adjusted.

1108
00:56:19,613 --> 00:56:21,548
There's too much iron inside.

1109
00:56:21,948 --> 00:56:25,719
A weight of 3.2g for each stone is enough for me,

1110
00:56:25,952 --> 00:56:27,887
but the right weight depends on the person.

1111
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:30,156
You must find the right weight for you.

1112
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,992
I see.

1113
00:56:32,425 --> 00:56:35,528
It is best to throw the stones near eye level.

1114
00:56:35,528 --> 00:56:37,697
If you throw them higher than your head, it's called Mount Baekdu.

1115
00:56:37,697 --> 00:56:40,433
It's considered as cheating in gonggi.

1116
00:56:42,135 --> 00:56:43,403
"Mount Baekdu"?

1117
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:45,505
Let's start from level one.

1118
00:56:46,773 --> 00:56:50,877
For level one, the stones must be spread out...

1119
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:52,345
as much as possible.

1120
00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:54,814
- Spread out? - Spread out like this.

1121
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:56,149
- Okay? - Okay.

1122
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:58,518
Level two is separating into pairs.

1123
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:02,956
Lift the middle finger slightly so the opponent doesn't notice.

1124
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:06,726
Do it instantly. It's not breaking the rules.

1125
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,094
It's a technique.

1126
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:09,696
Level three.

1127
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:12,065
Put one stone under the thumb.

1128
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:13,633
Drop it later.

1129
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:15,135
The time difference is miniscule.

1130
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,771
Play safely from level three.

1131
00:57:18,038 --> 00:57:20,507
- Okay? - Play safely from level three.

1132
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,245
It's cold.

1133
00:57:26,646 --> 00:57:28,848
Why isn't she out yet?

1134
00:57:31,651 --> 00:57:32,919
What is this?

1135
00:57:35,588 --> 00:57:37,257
Hello, this is Park Chang Ho.

1136
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:38,458
Goodness.

1137
00:57:38,825 --> 00:57:42,062
He sends me messages after I blocked his calls.

1138
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:45,031
Even his messages are long.

1139
00:57:45,265 --> 00:57:47,534
What's this? Is it some kind of thesis?

1140
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:49,736
Goodness.

1141
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:51,838
I should block his messages too.

1142
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:54,641
I'm sorry for being late, Jun Ki.

1143
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:55,809
It's okay.

1144
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:58,545
What shall we do today?

1145
00:57:58,545 --> 00:58:00,013
Let's do what you want to do.

1146
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,682
Then let's go to a karaoke room.

1147
00:58:06,586 --> 00:58:08,988
- Karaoke? - Why? You don't want to?

1148
00:58:10,924 --> 00:58:13,126
Of course I do. Let's go.

1149
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:15,729
Karaoke.

1150
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:18,865
I'm so excited.

1151
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:22,836
I always wanted to sing this song when I had a boyfriend.

1152
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,370
Can I start?

1153
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,706
Sure, go ahead.

1154
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:28,274
Let's see.

1155
00:58:30,443 --> 00:58:32,746
4777.

1156
00:58:32,746 --> 00:58:34,914
I can't get used to this. Seriously.

1157
00:58:44,257 --> 00:58:46,926
I waited for today

1158
00:58:49,028 --> 00:58:51,765
I waited for this night to come

1159
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,638
The night I spend alone with you

1160
00:58:58,638 --> 00:59:01,274
I've been waiting for it

1161
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:04,711
Don't turn...

1162
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:08,014
What are you doing? I was enjoying it.

1163
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,951
You're too young to sing such an erotic song.

1164
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:13,987
- What do you mean? - Be quiet!

1165
00:59:14,287 --> 00:59:17,423
Sing songs like this, you little girl.

1166
00:59:17,457 --> 00:59:19,025
156.

1167
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,127
"Pororo"?

1168
00:59:21,294 --> 00:59:23,296
It's "Pororo".

1169
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:30,904
I love playing the most

1170
00:59:31,538 --> 00:59:34,407
Gather around, my friends

1171
00:59:34,407 --> 00:59:36,342
Why aren't you singing? Sing!

1172
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:41,981
Little Penguin Pororo

1173
00:59:41,981 --> 00:59:43,082
Sing with excitement!

1174
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:52,759
We're already home.

1175
00:59:53,393 --> 00:59:54,594
That's sad.

1176
00:59:54,661 --> 00:59:58,131
If we got married, we wouldn't have to part.

1177
00:59:58,298 --> 01:00:00,700
What? "Married"?

1178
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:04,871
Jun Ki, if we get married, where shall we go for honeymoon?

1179
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:08,041
What? Honeymoon?

1180
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:09,509
I want to go to the Maldives.

1181
01:00:10,343 --> 01:00:12,478
- And... - Stop it.

1182
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:15,682
Watch what you say, little girl.

1183
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:19,752
No, this is wrong.

1184
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:22,488
Seo Jin.

1185
01:00:23,056 --> 01:00:25,058
I have something to tell you.

1186
01:00:28,528 --> 01:00:29,762
Seo Jin.

1187
01:00:30,296 --> 01:00:31,998
I tried hard,

1188
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:35,835
but I can only see you as a little girl.

1189
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:41,207
No matter how much I try, I can't see you as a woman.

1190
01:00:42,408 --> 01:00:43,776
So...

1191
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:47,947
let's end it, please?

1192
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:52,085
I'm sorry, Seo Jin.

1193
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,060
Wait.

1194
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:06,299
Don't do this, Seo Jin.

1195
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:08,501
Please understand me.

1196
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:33,326
Can't you see me as a woman even now?

1197
01:01:35,094 --> 01:01:36,396
I do.

1198
01:01:37,764 --> 01:01:39,132
I see you as a woman.

1199
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:41,901
No, your answer sounds weak.

1200
01:01:42,335 --> 01:01:44,304
You still don't see me as a woman.

1201
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:46,039
What?

1202
01:01:49,075 --> 01:01:52,812
Get out of my way!

1203
01:01:59,485 --> 01:02:00,620
What?

1204
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,989
Did Dong Gu not see us?

1205
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:04,390
I don't think so.

1206
01:02:04,657 --> 01:02:06,392
What's wrong with him?

1207
01:02:06,392 --> 01:02:09,395
I don't know. He seems possessed.

1208
01:02:09,462 --> 01:02:12,198
I'm glad that he didn't see us.

1209
01:02:16,235 --> 01:02:17,437
I'm back!

1210
01:02:18,638 --> 01:02:20,907
Hello, Dong Gu. Have you had dinner?

1211
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:22,608
I'm not hungry. Anyway,

1212
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:25,511
let's play one more round as promised.

1213
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:29,215
Gonggi.

1214
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:32,051
Pardon?

1215
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:56,075
The person who scores 100 first wins.

1216
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:59,078
The penalty is 20 hits on the head.

1217
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:01,114
Do you agree?

1218
01:03:01,581 --> 01:03:03,316
Yes, it sounds good.

1219
01:03:03,316 --> 01:03:04,884
Then let's decide the rules.

1220
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,555
Mount Baekdu is not allowed.

1221
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:10,656
(Throwing stones higher than one's head.)

1222
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:13,426
You're out if the stones go above your head. You know, right?

1223
01:03:13,426 --> 01:03:15,128
Yes, I understand.

1224
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,764
Bamboo Basket must be banned too.

1225
01:03:17,897 --> 01:03:19,132
When you catch the stones,

1226
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:20,733
(Catching stones with one's palm facing up.)

1227
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:22,402
you're out if you catch them like this.

1228
01:03:22,402 --> 01:03:23,636
Of course.

1229
01:03:25,304 --> 01:03:26,506
And...

1230
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,376
Arirang counts.

1231
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:34,680
Of course. Arirang must count.

1232
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,049
(Attempting two catches during the final stage of the game.)

1233
01:03:36,382 --> 01:03:37,817
Let's start.

1234
01:03:38,518 --> 01:03:39,919
Let's decide the order.

1235
01:03:39,919 --> 01:03:41,220
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1236
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:53,132
I won.

1237
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:55,701
Then I'll start.

1238
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,048
(Mount Baekdu)

1239
01:04:09,048 --> 01:04:10,216
You're out.

1240
01:04:12,919 --> 01:04:14,187
Mount Baekdu.

1241
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,359
Beans.

1242
01:04:26,265 --> 01:04:27,500
Knock.

1243
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,302
(Dong Gu: 41, Hyun Joon: 49)

1244
01:04:35,842 --> 01:04:38,244
That's it. Yes.

1245
01:04:56,362 --> 01:04:58,231
(Dong Gu: 52, Hyun Joon: 56)

1246
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:03,569
The score...

1247
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:07,907
is 96 to 83.

1248
01:05:14,981 --> 01:05:16,582
If I lose this time,

1249
01:05:17,216 --> 01:05:19,585
Hyun Joon will win.

1250
01:05:21,721 --> 01:05:22,889
I'm in trouble.

1251
01:05:23,556 --> 01:05:24,757
What should I do?

1252
01:05:25,491 --> 01:05:26,659
What do I need to do?

1253
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,367
Lastly,

1254
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:37,503
I'll teach you a special skill to use...

1255
01:05:37,503 --> 01:05:39,372
in times of need.

1256
01:05:39,605 --> 01:05:40,973
A special skill?

1257
01:05:40,973 --> 01:05:42,742
Let's say it's your turn,

1258
01:05:42,742 --> 01:05:44,777
but if the turn goes over to the opponent,

1259
01:05:44,777 --> 01:05:46,779
you'll probably lose.

1260
01:05:46,812 --> 01:05:49,549
You threw the stones...

1261
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:52,652
and managed to put four stones on the back of your hand.

1262
01:05:52,652 --> 01:05:53,786
In that moment,

1263
01:05:54,554 --> 01:05:56,122
what choice will you make?

1264
01:05:56,122 --> 01:05:57,256
Well,

1265
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,325
I'll catch four stones safely,

1266
01:05:59,325 --> 01:06:00,893
and start from the start again...

1267
01:06:00,893 --> 01:06:02,762
No, no, no!

1268
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:04,830
If you make that choice,

1269
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:07,233
the game is already over.

1270
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,136
You can't be sure you'll be able...

1271
01:06:10,136 --> 01:06:12,471
to go over the whole round without making a mistake.

1272
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:14,507
Then what should I do?

1273
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:16,375
You need to make a winning bet...

1274
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:18,244
with a skill called "Arirang",

1275
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:20,246
"Arirang"?

1276
01:06:20,246 --> 01:06:22,515
It refers to an advanced skill...

1277
01:06:22,515 --> 01:06:25,718
in which you need to catch the stone...

1278
01:06:25,718 --> 01:06:29,188
from below and from above.

1279
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:32,625
You can have five times the score of the normal throws.

1280
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:33,926
It's a special skill.

1281
01:06:34,493 --> 01:06:37,330
- Five times? - In times of need,

1282
01:06:38,764 --> 01:06:42,201
don't forget the Arirang skill.

1283
01:06:43,135 --> 01:06:46,572
All right. There's no other choice for me.

1284
01:06:46,939 --> 01:06:49,242
I need to make a winning bet.

1285
01:06:50,876 --> 01:06:52,078
This doesn't feel good.

1286
01:06:52,745 --> 01:06:55,147
I don't feel good.

1287
01:06:55,982 --> 01:06:57,984
But don't worry.

1288
01:06:59,385 --> 01:07:00,586
I have...

1289
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:03,889
the Arirang skill.

1290
01:07:52,004 --> 01:07:53,172
Oh, my.

1291
01:07:55,675 --> 01:07:57,977
I did it. I did the Arirang skill!

1292
01:07:57,977 --> 01:07:59,312
Did you see that? Did you?

1293
01:07:59,312 --> 01:08:00,780
You can have five times the score for an Arirang skill.

1294
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,214
I'll get 20 points.

1295
01:08:02,214 --> 01:08:04,050
That means I won.

1296
01:08:12,058 --> 01:08:13,292
Dong Gu,

1297
01:08:13,693 --> 01:08:15,227
I lost.

1298
01:08:15,895 --> 01:08:19,065
My back hurts from playing gonggi.

1299
01:08:19,165 --> 01:08:22,068
I need to use the bathroom.

1300
01:08:23,002 --> 01:08:24,303
Excuse me, Hyun Joon.

1301
01:08:26,372 --> 01:08:28,207
You must have forgotten something.

1302
01:08:44,123 --> 01:08:46,092
Kang Dong Gu.

1303
01:08:50,629 --> 01:08:53,332
Gosh.

1304
01:09:01,107 --> 01:09:02,908
Thank you so much for the past few days.

1305
01:09:03,175 --> 01:09:04,577
I'll get going now.

1306
01:09:05,644 --> 01:09:07,079
Take care.

1307
01:09:08,514 --> 01:09:09,782
Wait.

1308
01:09:11,183 --> 01:09:14,053
- Let me ask you something. - Ask away.

1309
01:09:14,053 --> 01:09:16,722
I heard you lent Yoon Ah your workroom...

1310
01:09:16,722 --> 01:09:19,492
so that she can practice baking.

1311
01:09:19,925 --> 01:09:21,127
What does that mean?

1312
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:23,262
What? What do you mean?

1313
01:09:23,262 --> 01:09:24,864
It's a little weird.

1314
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:27,333
There must be many students in your class.

1315
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:29,835
Why would you give such benefits to Yoon Ah alone?

1316
01:09:30,035 --> 01:09:33,472
I feel like she's like-minded, as we raise kids by ourselves.

1317
01:09:34,974 --> 01:09:36,175
Really?

1318
01:09:37,076 --> 01:09:39,011
- I thought... - That was the reason at first.

1319
01:09:39,845 --> 01:09:41,914
But now, I'm a little into her.

1320
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:44,216
What?

1321
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:46,385
I'm interested in her.

1322
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:47,820
I mean,

1323
01:09:48,788 --> 01:09:50,156
I like her.

1324
01:10:12,278 --> 01:10:15,581
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1325
01:10:15,581 --> 01:10:18,117
They shouldn't stay close.

1326
01:10:18,117 --> 01:10:19,752
What's wrong? Why the wheelchair?

1327
01:10:19,752 --> 01:10:21,854
It's going to be a problem. You can't move.

1328
01:10:21,854 --> 01:10:23,989
Don't worry. I'll stay next to him.

1329
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:25,124
Yoon Ah, are you home?

1330
01:10:25,124 --> 01:10:26,725
Why are you here, Hyun Joon?

1331
01:10:26,725 --> 01:10:28,194
I want to start an internet shopping mall.

1332
01:10:28,194 --> 01:10:29,762
Not everyone can do business.

1333
01:10:29,762 --> 01:10:31,430
Is there a way to advertise?

1334
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:33,632
Why can't I do anything right?

1335
01:10:33,632 --> 01:10:35,201
I really tried my best.

1336
01:10:35,201 --> 01:10:36,769
Sir, it's Du Shik.

1337
01:10:36,869 --> 01:10:40,206
Giorgio Armani

1338
01:10:40,206 --> 01:10:43,409
Shopping mall

1339
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:45,144
What are you doing?

1340
01:10:45,144 --> 01:10:46,212
Jun Ki started it first.

1341
01:10:46,212 --> 01:10:48,047
You didn't need to tell him off.

1342
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:51,016
Jun Ki, if there's something going on between you and my sister,

1343
01:10:51,016 --> 01:10:54,854
you're going to die.

1344
01:10:54,854 --> 01:10:56,422
Do we really need to go this far?

1345
01:10:56,422 --> 01:10:57,790
Can't we just tell them?

1346
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:58,991
I have a boyfriend.

1347
01:10:58,991 --> 01:11:00,759
What? A boyfriend?
