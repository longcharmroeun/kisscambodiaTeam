00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:12,435
<i>No, I'm all just fine.</i>

4
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:14,271
<i>Don't feel burdened by me.</i>

5
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:17,650
<i>I don't even have a boyfriend now.</i>

6
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:21,318
<i>But why aren't you
saying anything at all?</i>

7
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:24,100
<i>You're too perfect for me.</i>

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,771
<i>I know by the look in your eyes.</i>

9
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:30,801
<i>No woman approaches
a man first like I do.</i>

10
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:32,639
<i>I am just the same.</i>

11
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>Just like this!</i>

12
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,359
Oh, my butt.

13
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:50,619
Oh, who's this?

14
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,926
Did you sleep well, our little Sol?

15
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:55,115
- Did you sleep well too, Yoon Ah?
- Yes.

16
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:56,226
You got up early today.

17
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:57,406
Good morning, Yoon Ah.

18
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,767
Morning, did you sleep well--

19
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:01,887
You probably didn't know,
but he always does that.

20
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,548
What group was it again?

21
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:05,725
- Groo... something.
- Grooming group.

22
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,057
It's called a grooming group.

23
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:09,471
Men need to change these days.

24
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:13,355
Yoon Ah, I'm actually a film actor.

25
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:15,706
- Actor.
- Wow, a film actor?

26
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:17,266
That's amazing.

27
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:19,525
Actor, yeah right.

28
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:22,799
You never even have lines and
just stand in the background.

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,617
Gosh, Writer Bong has
such a pretty way with words.

30
00:01:26,617 --> 00:01:27,995
Doo Shik, you're a writer?

31
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:29,756
Wow, what do you write?

32
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,926
I write novels and web novels.

33
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,087
My dream is to become a screenwriter.

34
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:37,754
You're writing a screenplay right now.

35
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:40,757
All you do is ghostwrite for students.

36
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:43,608
Last time, he got paid a bag of snacks.

37
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:47,510
He wrote a paper for
the neighbor primary school student.

38
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,564
He's not a writer.
He teaches people wrong things.

39
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:52,063
Are you done now?

40
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:54,203
Give it a rest now.

41
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:57,364
You two are just the same.
No one is better.

42
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:59,284
Hey, we're still better than you.

43
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:00,960
You said you'd become a film director.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,012
You tried to bake a sweet potato
and burned the set down.

45
00:02:04,712 --> 00:02:06,373
Why would you bring that up?

46
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:08,252
It wasn't a sweet potato.
It was a potato.

47
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:10,760
Whether it's a sweet potato or potato,
you started the fire.

48
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,187
How is it the same? How!

49
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:14,317
Sweet potato is two words
and potato is one!

50
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:15,451
How is that the same?

51
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,536
Why bring up word count
when I'm talking about fire?

52
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:18,644
Sweet potato and potato are different!

53
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:21,209
Why did you say crap to Joon Ki
and start this?

54
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,901
Why are you fighting?
Try to calm down.

55
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,286
Why did you have bring it all up?

56
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:28,450
- He started it.
- No, you did.

57
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,878
Shut up!

58
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,228
Men are so childish.

59
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:35,907
Try to understand, Yoon Ah.
Men in this house are so strange.

60
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:38,566
Ha! What? Strange?

61
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,663
If we're talking strange,
you're at the top of the list, Chewbacca.

62
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:43,754
Chewbacca? What is that?

63
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:46,139
You know that furry guy on Star Wars.

64
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,457
Hold on.

65
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:48,629
Here it is.

66
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,420
Chewbacca!

67
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,688
Ah, but what does this
have to do with Seo Jin?

68
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:56,300
This Chewbacca and Seo Jin
are connected--

69
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:58,728
I told you to stop, didn't I?
I told you to stop.

70
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,311
I won't do it. I won't.

71
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,075
Chewbacca!

72
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,376
- Chewbacca!
- You're dead.

73
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,724
Ouch, ouch.

74
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:10,100
He's older than us, after all.

75
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,110
Look at you!

76
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,836
You two siblings have bad tempers.

77
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,981
<i>They are really odd people.</i>

78
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:20,491
<i>Did I make the right decision
staying here?</i>

79
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:26,883
Are you hungry, Sol?
Should we eat?

80
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:28,846
Sol, let's have some food.

81
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:30,661
You were so hungry, weren't you?

82
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:33,002
Yummy food, yummy food.

83
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:34,915
That startled me.

84
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,985
- She's the strangest person.
- You're right.

85
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,649
Why does she do that?

86
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,204
<i>[Anyone Can Become Wolverine]</i>

87
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:48,823
So, should we
get started on cleaning now?

88
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:52,493
Yeah, Seo Jin said
she'd inspect everything.

89
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,737
Let's hurry before she says
something again.

90
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:59,591
But do all three of us
really need to clean?

91
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,352
That's why I'm bringing this up...

92
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,825
Want to make a bet?

93
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:05,490
A bet?

94
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,159
So, you're going to put on pants
without using hands?

95
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,431
Does that make sense?

96
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:17,740
- How can you do that without hands?
- I know, right?

97
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,250
If I fail to do so,
I'll clean on your behalf.

98
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,149
If I succeed,
I'm exempt from cleaning.

99
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,802
What do you think? Are you in?

100
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,083
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

101
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,487
Let's go!

102
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:41,514
30 seconds.

103
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,454
He can't do it.

104
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:52,526
What is that?

105
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:54,663
- What?
- What?

106
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,512
- What's he doing?
- What's going on?

107
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:58,706
That actually works?

108
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:02,107
Oh, what is that?

109
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:04,526
What's going on here?

110
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:05,927
What are you doing?

111
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:10,132
I told you to clean.
What is this insane nonsense?

112
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,670
- I was going to clean.
- Me too.

113
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,649
Hey, hey! I succeeded.

114
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,060
I'm exempt, okay?

115
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,182
Exempt, yeah right.

116
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:21,100
- Follow me.
- I said I'm exempt.

117
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,803
I succeeded in exemption. Hey!

118
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:30,317
I'm so tired.

119
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:33,060
There's so much to clean because
we have an increase in guests.

120
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,427
You only cleaned a little
and you're complaining.

121
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:39,086
Get moving, already.
It's check-in time soon.

122
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:42,040
All right. Aren't you
going to the library today?

123
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,262
- You're going fool around if I go?
- No!

124
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,728
You're graduating soon.
How's your job search going?

125
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:50,447
I want to get a job.

126
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:53,237
I really, really want to find a job,
but it's not easy.

127
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:55,350
It's so hard to get a job these days.

128
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:56,937
Stay strong.

129
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:59,040
I do get strength from you, Doo Shik.

130
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:00,838
Oh, come on.

131
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,637
I keep thinking I'll become like you
if I don't get it together.

132
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:06,329
I even wake up in the middle
of the night. Thank you.

133
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,677
That girl.

134
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:15,302
What are you doing?

135
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,291
Are you going to do this all day?

136
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,273
Wash the bed sheets and
clean the rooftop too.

137
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:22,223
Also, put away the tree
in the lobby area.

138
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:23,714
Christmas passed ages ago--

139
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:25,767
I got it so stop nagging me.

140
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:27,810
I'm already feeling upset.

141
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,329
What are you upset about?

142
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,492
- Su Ah and I broke up.
- I know.

143
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,569
It wasn't enough
that you were an incompetent guy

144
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,062
but you sold your couple ring too.

145
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,954
Yet, you still can't get over her
and you're hanging around annoyingly.

146
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,341
- Who said that?
- Joon Ki.

147
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:41,120
That guy has such a big mouth.

148
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,023
Things are over once it ends.
Just get over it.

149
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:45,841
I dated Su Ah for four years.

150
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:48,401
How can she and I break up like that?
I won't accept it.

151
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:49,779
Then meet her and talk to her.

152
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,569
She won't meet with me.
She ignores my calls and texts.

153
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,297
She won't meet me
even if I go to see her.

154
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:56,199
Su Ah is very set on breaking up.

155
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,774
Isn't she being too harsh?

156
00:06:57,774 --> 00:07:00,050
Hey, in your eyes...

157
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,742
is your brother untrustworthy
and someone with no future?

158
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:03,841
Huh?

159
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:06,372
- Look at the time.
- What?

160
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,372
It's time for me to
go to the library. Bye now.

161
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:11,711
That kid.

162
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:14,901
My only little sister
is looking down on me too.

163
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,877
Oh, I'm so tired.

164
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:21,151
I'm going to die from cleaning too much.

165
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:24,242
You all worked hard.
Would you like a drink or something?

166
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,624
- Yes.
- No, thank you.

167
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,853
Stop putting so much on.

168
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:32,742
Hey, you have to put a lot on the
T-zone because it comes off fast.

169
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:35,740
Also, I have a film shoot today.
That's why I'm doing this.

170
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,833
Which film is it this time?

171
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,165
You guys know the X-Men, right?

172
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:40,632
It's a Korean "X-Men."

173
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:43,120
It's a film about
the struggle of those mutants.

174
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,360
Who's starring in it?

175
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:46,225
Jo In Sung.

176
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:50,449
This was be a hit, 100 percent.

177
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,987
Besides that, I will become a star.

178
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,427
Besides that...

179
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:59,778
it's only a matter of time before
I won't have to see your faces.

180
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:01,879
This star better get going then.

181
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:03,583
Do a good job.

182
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:05,970
See you later.

183
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:08,884
Oh no. What do I do?

184
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,987
Yoon Ah, are you okay? Are you hurt?

185
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,857
No, I'm fine.

186
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:15,461
You should've been more careful.

187
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,687
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:20,951
Excuse me.

189
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:24,079
I haven't actually approved
you living here yet.

190
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,348
I'll see how you are at working.

191
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:28,538
If it doesn't work out,
then I'll ask you to leave.

192
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:31,279
Yes, don't worry. I'll work hard.

193
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,551
Just go. I'll clean up here.

194
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,522
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:50,614
Wait, give me the rubber gloves.

196
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,144
Oh, right.

197
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,409
Oh no. What did I do?

198
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,481
What do I do?

199
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,110
Oh my. I'm so sorry.

200
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,884
Hey, the bubbles!

201
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:07,629
Ew, what is this,
first thing in the morning?

202
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,706
- Gosh.
- I'm sorry.

203
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:13,110
Stop saying sorry and please just go.

204
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,238
I'm just so sorr...

205
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:17,826
I mean... I apologize.

206
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:20,326
Gosh, seriously.

207
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:24,508
I don't like her. I don't like her.
I really don't like her.

208
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:26,918
She can't focus because of her baby.
What can she do?

209
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:29,129
You're really irritated lately.

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,138
Is it because of Su Ah?

211
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:34,403
It's not like that.

212
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,408
What do you mean it's not?
It's written on your face.

213
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,687
I said it's not!

214
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:38,918
Just know that it's not!

215
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:41,577
Why won't you listen
when I tell you that it's not!

216
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:43,788
So annoying! You clean it.

217
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,342
So upsetting.

218
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:49,841
Why does he always get angry at me?

219
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:51,154
<i>I can hear you!</i>

220
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:55,635
Director.

221
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:56,974
Are you ready to shoot?

222
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:58,465
Yeah, almost.

223
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:01,884
Radiation mutant!

224
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,009
Where are you?

225
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,980
- Hello, Director.
- Hey.

226
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,390
Great makeup job. Looks good.

227
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,660
We're start once In Sung arrives.

228
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,020
- Stand by.
- Yes, Sir.

229
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,913
Where's the genetic mutant?

230
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,649
Genetic mutant!

231
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,307
Hello?

232
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:34,428
What? What did you say?

233
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:37,099
Ah, that's a big problem.

234
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:39,735
Okay. Gosh, I'm going insane.

235
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:40,765
What is it?

236
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,534
In Sung got into an accident on his way
and is in the hospital.

237
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:46,827
Then what do we do about filming today?

238
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:47,918
What can we do?

239
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:49,864
The star isn't here.
We have to shut it down.

240
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:53,534
Assistant Director, what should I do?

241
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:56,201
Take off the makeup for today.

242
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,292
What do you mean?

243
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,631
Why would you take it off?
The makeup fee is expensive.

244
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:03,543
Go home just like this and
come back tomorrow like this.

245
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:04,717
Got it?

246
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:06,714
Looking just like this?

247
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:10,309
If you ruin your makeup at all,
I'll get rid of your role.

248
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:11,645
It's up to you, okay?

249
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:15,957
Get rid of it?

250
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:18,583
We're shutting down for today.

251
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,604
Wait. Where is everyone going?

252
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,934
This is... what do I do?

253
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,154
Huh? Wait.

254
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:33,306
Hello, there.

255
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:40,190
- What is that?
- So scary.

256
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,770
- What is that?
- What in the world?

257
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,360
What is that?

258
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:47,922
You have to take a picture.

259
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:52,631
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

260
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,863
Why are there so many people?

261
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,990
I can't ruin the costume.

262
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,812
Sorry.

263
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,442
You should be more careful.

264
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:48,020
I told her to clean the towels,
and yet they're still here.

265
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:51,384
That woman doesn't do anything right.

266
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,116
- Dong Gu.
- What?

267
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:55,418
Who are you?

268
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,924
What are you? What?

269
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:58,940
It's me.

270
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,500
Joon Ki? Why do you look like that?

271
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,527
The shoot got delayed because
the star got into an accident.

272
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:06,590
The director doesn't want
to pay for makeup again.

273
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,456
He has to stay like that
and go back tomorrow.

274
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,648
You sure live a hard life.
You really do.

275
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:14,182
I don't want to hear it.

276
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:16,587
I'm really embarrassed too.

277
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,940
Geez.

278
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,195
Gosh.

279
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,644
Doo Shik, put the phone against my ear.

280
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:32,339
Hello. Yes, I'm Lee Joon Ki.

281
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:35,297
What? The police station?

282
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,240
<i>We caught a pick-pocket thief.</i>

283
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,989
<i>He had your wallet.</i>

284
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:41,067
My wallet? Hold on a moment.

285
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,059
What?

286
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,071
Why, that jerk. My wallet!

287
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:49,014
Yes, I'll be right there.

288
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:50,899
- Hang it up.
- Wait.

289
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,130
You're going like that?

290
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,573
What can I do?
It had my ID, credit cards, money...

291
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:56,139
Ah, I have no money.

292
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:59,355
That little jerk. He's dead.

293
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,575
Nothing is normal here.

294
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:06,645
What is this?

295
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,052
Who left the fridge door open?

296
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,517
What if all the food goes bad?

297
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:19,105
This was that woman again,
wasn't it?

298
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,365
Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

299
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,563
Yes, did you call for me?

300
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:28,384
Did you do all of this?

301
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:31,250
I was cleaning the fridge
when Sol started to cry.

302
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,363
- I'll clean it soon.
- Forget it.

303
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:34,744
Take care of Sol first.

304
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,918
What is this?

305
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,840
The mushrooms are growing mushrooms.

306
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,163
Throw this out.

307
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:42,259
Yes, yes.

308
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:45,778
You finished eating, Sol?
Go to sleep now.

309
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:47,325
Do your work properly.

310
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:48,376
I'm sorry.

311
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:52,268
If you're so sorry,
don't do things to be sorry for.

312
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,798
What now? What's going on?

313
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:55,708
This is all your fault!

314
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,687
- You and Joon Ki.
- Gosh, every time...

315
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,692
You make me the bad guy.

316
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,592
Why is he taking it out on me?

317
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:04,934
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

318
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:05,984
No.

319
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:08,684
Yoon Ah, give Sol to me.

320
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:11,241
I'll watch Sol.
You can clean this up.

321
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,269
I just feel so bad about it.

322
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:14,375
It's okay.

323
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,474
I have nothing to do
before my part-time job.

324
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:20,856
Also, Sol likes me so much.

325
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,886
Isn't that right, Sol?

326
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,722
You like me enough to vomit?

327
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,974
All right?

328
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:46,063
Since I've suffered pain already,
why don't you let me off?

329
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:49,485
You want a beating?
You little punk!

330
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:50,995
Ah, excuse me.

331
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:52,216
How can I help you?

332
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,078
Who are you?

333
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,947
Who... who are you?

334
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:59,008
I... I got a phone call.

335
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,671
My name is Lee Joon Ki and
I was told my wallet is here.

336
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,471
Could you please put the gun down?

337
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:07,034
Ah, you're the victim I spoke to earlier.

338
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,048
- Ah, yes.
- You scared me.

339
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:10,668
Why is your face like that?

340
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:13,881
Ah, I'm an actor.

341
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,802
My film shoot got delayed suddenly.

342
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:17,369
You said my wallet is here?

343
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,087
My wallet... there it is.

344
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:20,241
Hold on.

345
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:21,951
We need to check your identity.

346
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,110
Lee Joon Ki.

347
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:29,501
Are you really Lee Joon Ki?

348
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:31,470
Yes, I am Lee Joon Ki. Take a look.

349
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,250
Well, it seems like you,
but not really.

350
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,243
Look, I am Lee Joon Ki.
We're the same.

351
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:41,346
I can't confirm because of the makeup.
Can't you do something?

352
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:43,571
No, I'll get fired if I damage this.

353
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:46,952
Ah, we can do fingerprints.
Give me your finger.

354
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:47,988
Fingerprints.

355
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:53,133
Can we remove this fur?

356
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,913
No way! I'll get fired if you do.

357
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:57,618
Then what do you expect me to do?

358
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,198
You can check my DNA.
You can take my blood.

359
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,229
You want me to check your DNA
just to check your identity?

360
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,558
Take your blood and hair to
the National Forensics Center?

361
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:06,710
Is that a bit much?

362
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:10,375
But it really is my wallet.
Please give it to me.

363
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,207
I can't give it to you
until I can confirm it's you.

364
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:16,001
How can a cop have such bad eyes?
Lee Joon Ki is Lee Joon Ki.

365
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,145
So, you couldn't get your wallet?

366
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:21,963
They couldn't confirm my identity.
What could I do?

367
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:24,726
He has no eye for things.
I don't know how he's a detective.

368
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:29,295
Are my looks something that can
be hidden by this makeup?

369
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:30,590
I'm home.

370
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,711
Chewbacca, you're back from the library?

371
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:35,519
I told you not to call me that. Oh my!

372
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,727
What is this thing?

373
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:38,346
Who else would do this in our house?

374
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:40,571
Joon Ki? Why do you look like this?

375
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:41,701
I don't know!

376
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:43,576
What kind of girl always hits first?

377
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:46,008
Sorry, I didn't know it was you.

378
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:49,122
I suppose you would've hit me with
the corner of the book if you knew.

379
00:17:49,122 --> 00:17:51,991
Thanks for using the flat side.

380
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:55,423
- The food is ready.
- Eat up.

381
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:57,702
It's mushroom stew.

382
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,324
Looks good.

383
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:03,049
Doo Shik, give Sol to me and eat.

384
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,338
Yoon Ah, you're not eating?

385
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:06,525
I ate bread earlier, so I'm full.

386
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,847
Go to Mommy.

387
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,603
Geez.

388
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,932
Wow, this stew broth is great.

389
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,441
Right, Dong Gu?

390
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,250
Well, it's not bad.

391
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,679
That's a relief.

392
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,002
I was worried it wouldn't
suit your tastes.

393
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,258
- Joon Ki.
- Yes?

394
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,295
- You should eat too.
- Oh, okay.

395
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:41,724
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

396
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:42,794
Are you an animal?

397
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:47,652
Yoon Ah, I have a favor to ask.

398
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:48,886
What is it?

399
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,541
Must you insist on eating like that?

400
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,932
I told you I'll get fired if my
makeup gets damaged.

401
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:06,133
Have some stew too.

402
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,067
Oh, that's nice. It's good, Yoon Ah.

403
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,357
Eat up, everyone.

404
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,673
Hello.

405
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:24,859
Su Ah, can't you meet me just once?

406
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,999
Give just a minute of your time.

407
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,779
I'll explain everything.

408
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:31,960
It's not right to
break up like this. Hello?

409
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,012
She hung up. Call again.

410
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,828
Oh, my stomach.

411
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,259
Why do I suddenly feel this way?

412
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:41,142
Ow.

413
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,930
Oh... oh.

414
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,939
What is this?
What are you all doing here?

415
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:49,267
Don't talk to me, man.

416
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,211
Chewbacca, get out now.

417
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:54,741
I'm going to die out here.

418
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:56,291
I feel like I'm going to die too.

419
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,369
At least you can talk,
I feel like I'm...

420
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:05,075
Joon Ki, you have stomach pains too?
You too, Doo Shik?

421
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:08,203
Yes, ever since I had lunch,
I feel sick.

422
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:10,345
- Ah!
- This won't do.

423
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,141
Hey, hey!

424
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:16,221
Oh, what was it that we ate?

425
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:18,077
What did we eat for lunch?

426
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:19,717
Mushroom stew, kimchi, and...

427
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:22,188
Mushroom stew?

428
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,416
It can't be.

429
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,006
What's the matter?

430
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:37,178
That stew you made earlier...

431
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:39,114
you didn't use
these mushrooms, did you?

432
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:40,884
I did. Why do you ask?

433
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:42,362
What do you mean why?

434
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:45,979
I told you to throw them out
earlier today because they went bad!

435
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,229
What? I'm so sorry.

436
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:50,573
I must've missed that
because I was focused on Sol.

437
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,488
Do you think "sorry" will fix everything?

438
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:54,601
Everyone is sick right now...

439
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:58,530
Oh no! What should I do?
I'm so sorry. I really am.

440
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:00,454
Forget it.

441
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:03,339
I can't let this go.

442
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:05,696

Wait. I just need one minute.

456
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,633
You have just one minute.
What do you want to say?

I'm sorry, but can I go somewhere briefly
and then talk to you?

- Forget it.
- Okay, I'll talk. Let's talk.

00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:37,145
Why did this have to happen now?

462
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:38,711
- What?
- It's nothing.

463
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:39,897
I'll talk.

464
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,932
Su Ah, I was very wrong.

465
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:46,824
- I'm very sorry.
- What are you sorry about?

466
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,903
- Everything.
- Everything like what?

467
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,063
Tell me in detail.

468
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:52,167

473
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:07,759

- There's more.

474

Yes, um...

475
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,556

530
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,759

00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:39,142
I'm sorry.

534
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:41,284
You should try to be careful.

535
00:26:41,285 --> 00:26:43,614
That was the only award Dong Gu received.

536
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:47,921
I'm sorry.

537
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:52,152
It's fine, you didn't do it on purpose.

538
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,785
People can make mistakes, right?

539
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,636
Don't worry about it.

540
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:59,094
What's with you?
You were telling her to pack up and go.

541
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:00,777
That was just to shock her.

542
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:03,086
It was a way to cheer her on
to do better in the future.

543
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:07,767
Yoon Ah, let's forget everything
that's happened so far.

544
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:10,076
Let's try to get along.

545
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:11,999
- What?
- All right?

546
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,130
Ah, yes.

547
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,630
<i>In return, you must take what
happened today to the grave.</i>

548
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:24,249
<i>Don't worry.</i>

549
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:27,567
<i>Thank you.</i>

550
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:36,727
Welcome...

551
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:41,407
Hello.

552
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:43,701
Oh no.

553
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,863
Gosh.

554
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:54,132
It's okay. I'll get them, so get on.

555
00:27:54,894 --> 00:27:56,061
I'm sorry.

556
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:01,603
Sorry about this.

557
00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:06,376
What am I doing?

558
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:10,826
I'd better get famous soon
so I don't have do these shameful things.

559
00:28:16,784 --> 00:28:18,759
Genetic mutant?

560
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:56,939
Oh, my stomach.

561
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:11,494
Seo Jin.

562
00:29:12,345 --> 00:29:13,400
Yoon Ah.

563
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:20,969
<i>[The Thing is, It's a Secret]</i>

564
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:35,598
Why would you do that?

565
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:38,865
It looked fun when my dad and
brother shaved, so I copied them.

566
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:43,022
It started to grow back thicker.

567
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,144
What's the big deal?
You can just shave it every now and then.

568
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:49,375
It's not just now and then.

569
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:52,413
If I don't do it for half a day...

570
00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:54,705
I start to get a shadow.

571
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:57,430
Gosh. Hey, you.

572
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,248
Why would you copy
shaving the face of all things?

573
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:02,638
I didn't know this would happen.

574
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:04,328
Is that why your nickname is Chewbacca?

575
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:06,580
Chewbacca isn't the only one.

576
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,810
Bigfoot, Zhang Fei,
Im Kkeokjeong, Jang Seung Eop.

577
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,401
- Anyone with lots of hair--
- Stop it!

578
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:14,490
Hey, it's okay.

579
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,910
Is growing facial hair a crime?
Don't worry about it.

580
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,079
Thanks, Doo Shik.

581
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,154
Hello. Yeah, Yoo Jin.

582
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,670
What? Senior Tae Hyun is coming?

583
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,075
Okay, I'll be right there.

584
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:31,481
Tae Hyun, the guy you've had
a crush on since your first year?

585
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,451
- It's not like that.
- Yeah right.

586
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:36,429
Life is good for a graduating student.
You even have time to date.

587
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:38,020
I'll take care of my life.

588
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,357
You take care of your own life, Joon Ki.

589
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:42,619
- Yes...
- I have to go.

590
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:45,181
- Look how excited she is.
- My gosh.

591
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:48,147
What good is that?
She hasn't even told him her feelings.

592
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:51,431
Seo Jin is a dating amateur
if you think about it.

593
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:54,407
I don't think a guy who's
always solo ought to say that.

594
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:56,390
Yoon Ah.

595
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,797
Oh, it's the angry guy.

596
00:30:57,797 --> 00:31:00,688
The eggs and bread have run out.
What's going on?

597
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:03,068
Oh no. I forgot.

598
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:05,519
- Sorry.
- How can you forget that?

599
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,230
I told you to buy it beforehand for
the guest's breakfasts.

600
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,968
Sorry, I'll go buy it now.

601
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,044
Hurry.

602
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,952
She doesn't do anything right.

603
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:17,362
Stop berating her.

604
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:18,913
She's trying her best.

605
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:20,561
Trying her best? Yeah right.

606
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:23,044
She's going to cause big trouble.

607
00:31:23,044 --> 00:31:24,079
I just know it for sure.

608
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,678
She'll get better with time.

609
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:27,384
Just trust her and wait.

610
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,269
Why did you come back?

611
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:32,047
I left the grocery cart here.

612
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:33,423
I'll get going.

613
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:37,123
You see. How can I trust her?

614
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:38,891
A person can forget.

615
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:43,144
- Why are you back again?
- I left my wallet.

616
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:46,756
I'll be back.

617
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,182
My goodness.

618
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:54,251
What is it this time? What?

619
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:56,393
Where is the grocery store?

620
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:14,667
How can you not know your way
when we've been here so many times?

621
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:18,641
Sorry, I'm very bad with directions.

622
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:20,935
I think I know for sure now.

623
00:32:21,494 --> 00:32:24,951
You sound so sure that I feel
more worried now.

624
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:27,330
I'm tired of nagging you too.

625
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,270
You need to do things right
on your own, okay?

626
00:32:30,874 --> 00:32:32,002
Okay?

627
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:37,378
What are you doing there?

628
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:39,568
The toys are on sale.

629
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:42,872
I've never been able to buy one for Sol.

630
00:32:42,872 --> 00:32:46,248
Wow, it's even expensive on sale.

631
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,451
Let's just go.

632
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,750
Pick just one.

633
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,163
Really?

634
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:53,953
But, it has to be just one.

635
00:32:54,382 --> 00:32:57,333
Thank you. Thank you so much.

636
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:02,423
Is she shameless or naive?

637
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:07,659
Oh, I'm sorry.

638
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:08,949
It's okay.

639
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:10,101
Su Ah.

640
00:33:11,078 --> 00:33:13,608
Who is it? Is he someone you know?

641
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:15,690
Oh, he's a friend.

642
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:19,661
Friend? Hey, Min Su Ah.

643
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:22,980
Who is this man? Who is this person?

644
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,516
Hello, I'm Lee Yoon Seok
and I'm dating Su Ah now.

645
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:29,738
Dating?

646
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:34,644
I own a Thai restaurant nearby.

647
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:37,291
If you come by sometime,
I'll treat you to a meal.

648
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:41,586
Dong Gu! Dong Gu, I picked one.
Buy me this.

649
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,788
Who's this?

650
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:45,037
Huh?

651
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:49,498
She's my girlfriend.

652
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:51,641
Girlfriend?

653
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:55,256
- You're already dating someone?
- You are, so can't I?

654
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:58,095
That's not a problem.

655
00:33:58,095 --> 00:34:01,407
- What does she do?
- What?

656
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:07,711
A doctor, a doctor.
She's a neurosurgeon.

657
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:11,186
Maybe because she's a doctor,
she always chooses toys like these.

658
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,179
Dong Gu, what's going--

659
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,273
You silly girl who only cares about work.

660
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:19,260
What are you doing?

661
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:23,360
Su Ah, we did run into them.

662
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,317
Should we have tea with them?

663
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:28,032
No, I'm not that comfortable with them.
There's no need.

664
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,099
No need to be uncomfortable.

665
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:33,692
Why don't we have dinner
at my restaurant after work?

666
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:36,565
Doctor Han here is very busy with work.

667
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:38,030
I don't know if she'll have time.

668
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,766
We'll see if we have time and decide.

669
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:41,018
Let's go, Yoon Ah.

670
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,871
Please let us pass. Beep, beep.

671
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:49,570
Dong Gu, what just happened?

672
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,632
- Be quiet, be quiet.
- Okay.

673
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,010
Is that Su Ah? She's very pretty.

674
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,226
Please be quiet.

675
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,940
- Quiet, please.
- Okay.

676
00:34:57,702 --> 00:34:59,867
Dong Gu, you are buying me
this toy, aren't you?

677
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:03,342
I will. I'll buy it all.
Please just be quiet.

678
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,802
What? Su Ah already has another guy?

679
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:13,911
What does he do?

680
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,521
I don't know.
He owns a Thai restaurant.

681
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:19,621
That guy invited me to his restaurant.

682
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,001
That arrogant punk.

683
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:24,516
Still, why would you lie
and say Yoon Ah was your girlfriend?

684
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:26,369
And you said she was a doctor?

685
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:29,952
I suddenly got angry seeing her
with another guy, so I couldn't think.

686
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:34,130
Gosh, Su Ah is completely
gone now. She's gone.

687
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,364
No, no.

688
00:35:36,364 --> 00:35:39,389
This could be a chance,
your last chance.

689
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,987
A chance? What do you mean?

690
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:45,297
I guarantee you that
Su Ah will contact you soon.

691
00:35:45,297 --> 00:35:46,996
I doubt it.

692
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:51,382
What? She really did.

693
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,804
See, what did I say?

694
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:55,985
How would you read this text?

695
00:35:57,106 --> 00:35:58,275
"Nice seeing you."

696
00:35:58,275 --> 00:35:59,635
"Your girlfriend is pretty."

697
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:01,757
No, that's wrong!

698
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:03,094
"Nice seeing you."

699
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,967
"Your girlfriend is pretty."

700
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:06,416
This is how it is.

701
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:10,452
Do, re, mi, fa, so...
So, it's that really irritated tone.

702
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:12,101
Oh, I doubt that.

703
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:14,563
You are all amateurs.

704
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:16,798
- Kang Dong Gu.
- Huh?

705
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:21,003
You're immature, with no ambition
and no future at all.

706
00:36:21,003 --> 00:36:22,291
So you were dumped.

707
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:24,862
Yoon Ah here very good looking.

708
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:27,467
Plus, she's apparently
a successful doctor.

709
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:28,849
How would Su Ah feel?

710
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:31,596
- That girl stepped in crap.
- No, no!

711
00:36:31,596 --> 00:36:34,172
Su Ah is really confused.

712
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,092
Her head is full of complex thoughts.

713
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:37,822
Why in the world? Why?

714
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,483
Why would a woman like that
be with Dong Gu?

715
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:41,690
Was Dong Gu really a decent catch?

716
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,610
Did Dong Gu have
something special I didn't see?

717
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,304
It's bothering her like crazy.
Huh, huh, huh?

718
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:51,094
That could be true. Then what?

719
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:56,340
If you use this chance wisely,
you could date Su Ah again.

720
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,637
- That's what.
- Really?

721
00:36:57,963 --> 00:37:00,036
Joon Ki, then what should I do?

722
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:03,467
What else? That guy invited you
to the restaurant.

723
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:05,777
You have to go with Yoon Ah.

724
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:07,458
As a close couple.

725
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,831
Then what?

726
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:11,889
Then you show her
what a great guy you are.

727
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:13,688
Make Su Ah regret it so much.

728
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:16,018
- How?
- That depends on Yoon Ah...

729
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,384
Depends on Doctor Han.

730
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:22,530
What? What am I supposed to do?

731
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,798
Yoon Ah, please help me.
I'm asking you for this favor.

732
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:28,331
I do want to help you,
but I don't feel confident about it.

733
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:29,717
Are you going to be this way?

734
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,231
If you help me this time,
I'll forget everything that happened.

735
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:35,585
So, please help me. Please, please?

736
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:38,773
All right.

737
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,474
Thank you. Thank you, Yoon Ah.

738
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:42,552
What do I have to do now? Huh?

739
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,938
We have to start by making
Doctor Han beautiful.

740
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:49,079
Elegant and gorgeous.

741
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:03,626
Oh, my bag. Gosh.

742
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:07,173
Oh, what brings you to school, Senior?

743
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:10,744
I was just dropping by
the career center.

744
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:12,824
I thought of you guys,
so I came by.

745
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:17,166
When is Senior Tae Hyun coming?

746
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,364
So, you're here to see him.

747
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:20,717
No, I'm here to see you guys.

748
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:21,989
Forget it.

749
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:23,938
He called a little while ago.

750
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:25,719
Work's taking long,
so he's running late.

751
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,610
I have somewhere to be.
I'll get going.

752
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,938
Okay. I... I'm going to go soon too!

753
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:32,228
I really am going!

754
00:38:47,804 --> 00:38:50,304
You look pretty decent dressed up.

755
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:52,650
You usually look like a bum.

756
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,626
It's only because I don't dress up.

757
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:57,059
I can be right up there with Gong Yoo.

758
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:58,929
Don't insult Gong Yoo.

759
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:00,019
You're not up there.

760
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,398
Can I trust you, Joon Ki?

761
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:04,349
Everything will work out
if you listen to me.

762
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:06,590
Nothing worked out from listening to you.

763
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,159
I don't know if this will work.

764
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,710
Just trust me. Trust me.

765
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,338
Everything about you is bad.

766
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:13,637
- Not trusting people is the worst.
- Be quiet.

767
00:39:13,637 --> 00:39:15,297
Why isn't Yoon Ah coming out?

768
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:40,686
How do I look?

769
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:43,949
I haven't put makeup on in a long time,
so it felt awkward.

770
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,268
Weird, right?

771
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:47,780
No.

772
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,559
You look pretty, very pretty.

773
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,746
Right, Joon Ki?

774
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:53,766
Yes, you do.

775
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:57,411
You look like a completely
different person.

776
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:59,266
Right, Dong Gu?

777
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:00,927
Yeah.

778
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:03,547
It's not bad.

779
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:05,967
- It's almost time. Let's go.
- Okay.

780
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:09,336
Will it be okay to leave Sol behind?

781
00:40:09,336 --> 00:40:12,094
Don't worry and go.
We'll take good care of Sol.

782
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:14,655
Okay, I'll be going then.

783
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:18,527
Make sure to succeed, Dong Gu.

784
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,396
Sol, wish your mom luck.

785
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:22,677
Good luck, Mom!

786
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:26,005
That is one strange "good luck."

787
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:27,697
What a good daughter you are.

788
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:28,936
Hold her, would you?

789
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:30,681
I need to go get some "good luck" too.

790
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,262
Why would you do that now? Joon Ki!

791
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,862
Why is it so empty here?

792
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,822
Seo Jin.

793
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,753
Kang Seo Jin.

794
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,483
Yes. What? What?

795
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:58,865
Oh, Senior Tae Hyun.

796
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:00,277
It's been a long time.

797
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:03,724
Yes, it's been a long time.

798
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:07,547
Work ended so late,
so I worried that no one would be here.

799
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:09,789
I'm so thankful that you waited for me.

800
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:12,161
I... I wasn't waiting for you.

801
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:14,630
I didn't even know you were coming.
Really, I didn't know.

802
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,184
Okay, okay.
No need to cause a fuss.

803
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:20,014
Oh yeah. We remodeled the media room.

804
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:21,393
Do you want to see it?

805
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:33,697
Wow, it's really clean now.

806
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:37,378
There used to spiderwebs and rats.

807
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,559
It was like a haunted house.

808
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:40,942
Oh!

809
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:43,561
This is still here?

810
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:44,775
What is it?

811
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:47,329
This... here.

812
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,833
Reporter Kang Seo Jin's first article.

813
00:41:51,581 --> 00:41:53,643
How is your employment search going?

814
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:56,429
I'm just trying hard.

815
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:59,172
Come to my newspaper.
Working together would be fun.

816
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:01,121
I already applied actually.

817
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,583
I didn't get hired.

818
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,572
Hey, it's okay.

819
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,798
I failed twice before getting hired.

820
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,481
You'll get in next time.
Stay strong.

821
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:26,331
I'm hungry. Should we go eat?

822
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:27,552
Re... really?

823
00:42:28,985 --> 00:42:30,405
We should go.

824
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,494
- What's wrong?
- Why isn't it opening?

825
00:42:36,612 --> 00:42:37,735
What do we do?

826
00:42:38,945 --> 00:42:40,393
Why isn't this opening?

827
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,125
Seo Jin, give me your phone.

828
00:42:43,724 --> 00:42:46,007
I left it on the desk earlier.

829
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:47,820
I left my phone in my bag too.

830
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,175
What should we do?

831
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:51,065
We're in trouble now.

832
00:42:58,353 --> 00:43:00,929
Yoon Ah, we'll go over it one more time.

833
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:03,648
- Your job?
- Korea's top neurosurgeon.

834
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:04,675
Your parents?

835
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:06,168
Dad's a hospital director
and mom's an artist.

836
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:07,356
The first place we met?

837
00:43:07,356 --> 00:43:09,762
The third table from the entrance
of the hospital cafeteria.

838
00:43:09,762 --> 00:43:11,728
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.

839
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:13,021
I'll do my best.

840
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:15,592
Okay, then let's go.

841
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:32,599
I didn't really think you'd come.
How unexpected.

842
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,385
Doctor Han finished work early,
so I dropped by.

843
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,427
I thought it was a great restaurant.

844
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,376
- It's quite simple.
- You think so?

845
00:43:44,945 --> 00:43:47,347
I can guarantee good food though.

846
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:49,460
Let's order first. Here's the menu.

847
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,518
Ah, you can choose.

848
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:54,753
Over here.

849
00:43:54,753 --> 00:43:56,717
Prepare these for us.

850
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,949
As for the dishes...

851
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:07,577
One each for those. Also...

852
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:13,911
- Those, as well.
- Yes, President.

853
00:44:15,048 --> 00:44:18,402
The names of the food sound like
Muay Thai athlete names.

854
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,594
It's very aggressive.

855
00:44:21,143 --> 00:44:22,581
What would you like for alcohol?

856
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:25,143
I don't need a drink.
I'm nursing right now.

857
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:27,463
What? Nursing?

858
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,992
No, it's not that.

859
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:34,409
Oh, not nursing...
she meant surgery.

860
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,891
Doctor Han has an important
surgery tomorrow morning.

861
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:39,329
Ah... surgery.

862
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,702
What kind of surgery?

863
00:44:42,702 --> 00:44:43,880
What?

864
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:47,697
It's... it's uh...

865
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:50,036
the duodenum area?

866
00:44:50,036 --> 00:44:51,260
What?

867
00:44:52,452 --> 00:44:55,552
Neurosurgeons do surgery
on the duodenum too?

868
00:44:55,552 --> 00:44:58,351
Well... well...

869
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,873
Doctor Han is a neurosurgeon.

870
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:04,840
She specializes in multiple areas.

871
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:06,798
Neurosurgery, general surgery,
and obstetrics.

872
00:45:06,798 --> 00:45:08,708
She specializes in all of them.

873
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,505
Why would a woman like Yoon Ah
be with someone like you...

874
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,831
Other people may think
there's not much to Dong Gu.

875
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:21,849
They are wrong about him.

876
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:23,577
I could see it.

877
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:26,206
I could Dong Gu's great future.

878
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,576
Oh, come on now.

879
00:45:29,576 --> 00:45:31,657
No, I'm sure of it.

880
00:45:31,657 --> 00:45:35,965
Dong Gu, you will become
a great film director in the world.

881
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:38,706
I've never been wrong about anything.

882
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:40,436
You can trust me on that.

883
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:44,748
I can't stop her.

884
00:45:45,682 --> 00:45:47,164
But, he still...

885
00:45:48,356 --> 00:45:52,987
has not opened up his heart to me,
so I'm suffering.

886
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:55,239
I told you.

887
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:58,090
The wound on my heart has yet to heal.

888
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,556
It's all right.

889
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:03,940
I don't expect anything more
from you, Dong Gu.

890
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:07,630
I'm sorry.

891
00:46:08,184 --> 00:46:10,001
What did I do to deserve you?

892
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:20,913
We're trapped in here.

893
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,041
I don't think we can leave until
the kids come tomorrow morning.

894
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:27,998
Still, because I'm here with you...

895
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:31,141
it's not so bad.

896
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:34,393
What do you mean?

897
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:36,554
Seo Jin.

898
00:46:36,554 --> 00:46:39,429
I have something...

899
00:46:40,324 --> 00:46:41,673
to tell you.

900
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,068
What is it?

901
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:49,344
Honestly, for a long time...

902
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:53,753
I...

903
00:46:56,826 --> 00:46:59,376
What? What is it?

904
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,378
You have...

905
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,163
something under your nose.

906
00:47:04,163 --> 00:47:06,251
What? Do I have
something under my nose?

907
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:07,423
Yes.

908
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:08,476
One moment.

909
00:47:13,882 --> 00:47:15,811
<i>Oh no. It's growing.</i>

910
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:17,112
<i>The hair is growing.</i>

911
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:19,110
<i>My razor is the bag.
What do I do?</i>

912
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,121
What? Is something wrong?

913
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,931
It's nothing. I think it's some dust.

914
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,103
I see.

915
00:47:29,664 --> 00:47:32,483
Anyway, what I wanted to say was...

916
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:34,034
Stay back. Stay back.

917
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:35,199
What's wrong with you?

918
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,240
I said to stay back, so stay back.

919
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,849
<i>I have to get out of here.</i>

920
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:42,851
<i>If I get caught here,
it's over for me.</i>

921
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:48,199
Excuse me! There's someone trapped here.

922
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,679
Please save me! Save me!

923
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:53,543
Seo Jin, what's the matter
all of the sudden?

924
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:55,016
Stay back. Just stay away.

925
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,721
Over here!

926
00:47:57,721 --> 00:47:59,597
Over here! Can anyone hear?

927
00:47:59,597 --> 00:48:01,391
Someone's trapped in here.

928
00:48:01,391 --> 00:48:03,353
<i>Kang Seo Jin, pull yourself together.</i>

929
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:05,539
<i>Please save me!</i>

930
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:09,860
I hope the food suited your taste.

931
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,724
It was not bad.

932
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:15,413
It wasn't as good as the traditional
Thai food Doctor Han tried in Bangkok.

933
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:16,762
Is that right?

934
00:48:16,762 --> 00:48:19,489
I feel a bit disappointed.
You should stay for one more drink.

935
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:21,159
I wish I could.

936
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:25,110
Doctor Han here has a surgery,
so she can't stay.

937
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,831
We will treat next time.

938
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:29,460
- Stay healthy.
- Okay.

939
00:48:30,356 --> 00:48:32,505
Today was fun, Yoon Ah.

940
00:48:32,505 --> 00:48:34,987
I had fun too. Let's go, Dong Gu.

941
00:48:34,987 --> 00:48:35,992
Yes.

942
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,081
Yoon Ah, stick closer to me.

943
00:48:40,081 --> 00:48:41,208
Like this?

944
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,563
Dong Gu, how was I today? Good?

945
00:48:43,563 --> 00:48:45,913
Good. You're a good actress.

946
00:48:45,913 --> 00:48:47,313
Your acting is great.

947
00:48:47,313 --> 00:48:48,682
Thank you.

948
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:54,186
<i>Why is my mom with your father?</i>

949
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:57,240
<i>It can't be...</i>

950
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,047
- It can't be.
- No way.

951
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:00,505
It makes no sense.

952
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:04,282
<i>Then you're saying
you are my father's daughter?</i>

953
00:49:04,282 --> 00:49:06,114
Daughter! Oh I'm sorry.

954
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:07,315
Oh my.

955
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:08,865
<i>You're my half sister?</i>

956
00:49:08,865 --> 00:49:11,041
Sister, sister, sister....

957
00:49:11,336 --> 00:49:13,449
<i>That's nonsense, nonsense!</i>

958
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:16,335
- What, what, what?
- Oh, oh!

959
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:18,155
<i>Why do you think it's nonsense?</i>

960
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,447
Why do you think it's nonsense?

961
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:21,737
<i>There's nothing in the world
that's nonsense.</i>

962
00:49:21,737 --> 00:49:23,476
<i>It's merely...</i>

963
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:26,802
<i>evil ambition that people want to hide.</i>

964
00:49:26,802 --> 00:49:28,561
- So scary.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

965
00:49:28,561 --> 00:49:31,565
<i>You cast aside
Yoo Geum Ran 30 years ago.</i>

966
00:49:31,565 --> 00:49:33,885
- He knows Yoo Geum Ran.
- What's going on?

967
00:49:33,885 --> 00:49:35,373
<i>How do you know her?</i>

968
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:38,726
<i>Because I am her daughter.</i>

969
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,018
<i>What? What did you say?</i>

970
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:43,882
<i>Then you're my daughter too?</i>

971
00:49:43,882 --> 00:49:46,490
- Daughter? Daughter, daughter!
- Awesome.

972
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,192
<i>I made the decision long ago.</i>

973
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:50,097
<i>I would get my revenge on you.</i>

974
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:52,489
<i>What?</i>

975
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,387
- <i>You devil.</i>
- Devil.

976
00:49:54,389 --> 00:49:55,876
- <i>You devil.</i>
- Devil.

977
00:49:55,876 --> 00:49:57,068
<i>You are the devil!</i>

978
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:04,798
Bravo.

979
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:07,389
Bravo, bravo.

980
00:50:08,153 --> 00:50:11,835
I want to applaud that show for
keeping us guessing until the end.

981
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:14,681
I never imagined the father-in-law's
wife was his own daughter.

982
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:15,751
Me too.

983
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:18,315
How can I wait until tomorrow?

984
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,706
I'm dying of curiosity.

985
00:50:21,023 --> 00:50:22,228
What are you doing?

986
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:24,146
You're back?

987
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:26,298
So, how'd it go?

988
00:50:26,298 --> 00:50:28,259
There was a little danger
in the beginning.

989
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:30,498
Yoon Ah is better at acting
than I thought.

990
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:32,717
Yeah? That's amazing, Yoon Ah.

991
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:34,402
I just tried my best.

992
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:37,608
You really think it'll work out, Joon Ki?

993
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:38,949
Of course.

994
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:41,873
Su Ah is probably
100 times more confused.

995
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:44,914
"Why did I dump that great guy?
Did I do a useless thing?"

996
00:50:44,914 --> 00:50:46,076
That's what she's thinking.

997
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,735
I really hope it works out like you say.

998
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,505
You must be tired
from watching Sol, right?

999
00:50:51,505 --> 00:50:54,137
No, she only vomited five times
and pooped seven times.

1000
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,458
And urinated about nine times.

1001
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:58,532
Oh, something's coming again.

1002
00:50:58,532 --> 00:51:00,702
Give Sol to me now.
I'll watch her.

1003
00:51:00,702 --> 00:51:02,797
Oh, Sol.

1004
00:51:02,797 --> 00:51:04,889
Oh, my arms hurt. I need to eat.

1005
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:06,023
Go on and eat.

1006
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,298
- I'm going to play games.
- Go on.

1007
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,108
Our Sol, did you tire out your uncles?

1008
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:13,206
Sol, did you miss Mommy?

1009
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:16,199
Mom missed you too, Sol.

1010
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:17,400
Mom?

1011
00:51:17,954 --> 00:51:19,550
What do you mean?

1012
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:24,081
Sol, did you miss Mommy?

1013
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,360
Mom missed you too, Sol.

1014
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,547
Mom?

1015
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,661
What do you mean?

1016
00:51:32,902 --> 00:51:35,032
Su Ah, what are you doing here?

1017
00:51:35,032 --> 00:51:36,413
Yoon Ah left her bag behind.

1018
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:39,538
Oh no. Did I do that?

1019
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:41,025
Thank you.

1020
00:51:41,025 --> 00:51:43,365
What do you mean by "mom"?

1021
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:46,414
You two have a baby? Since when?

1022
00:51:47,153 --> 00:51:49,757
It wasn't when
you were dating me, was it?

1023
00:51:49,757 --> 00:51:52,748
No, why would you say
such an awful thing?

1024
00:51:52,748 --> 00:51:54,318
- Then what?
- Oh.

1025
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:55,518
That's just...

1026
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:59,559
Yoon Ah likes babies,
so she always says "mom."

1027
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:01,400
It's a habit, right?

1028
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,219
Of course, why would
I have a baby at this age?

1029
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:05,510
How cute.

1030
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,018
Then who is that baby?

1031
00:52:07,018 --> 00:52:10,054
Hold on. That baby...

1032
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:12,969
- Isn't she the one the guest left?
- Yeah.

1033
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:14,521
Yes, that...

1034
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:17,516
Well, we decided to raise her.

1035
00:52:17,516 --> 00:52:20,652
Why would you raise a stranger's baby?

1036
00:52:20,652 --> 00:52:23,893
Oh, uh... hm...

1037
00:52:25,902 --> 00:52:26,954
She's Joon Ki's.

1038
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:32,753
What? She's Joon Ki's baby?

1039
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:36,844
So, it was Joon Ki's girlfriend
who left her here?

1040
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:40,327
You know he lives recklessly.
He deserves punishment.

1041
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:41,873
Really, Joon Ki?

1042
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,764
You know I live recklessly.

1043
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:54,791
I suppose you would
do something like that.

1044
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:57,221
Oh, thanks for the bag.

1045
00:52:57,221 --> 00:52:58,413
It's late, so get going.

1046
00:52:59,925 --> 00:53:02,320
I would feel hurt to just leave
when we're already here.

1047
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:05,409
Show us the guest house
and let's have a beer too.

1048
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:07,534
Sure, sure.

1049
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:10,155
Yoon Ah, can you take them to
the third floor then?

1050
00:53:10,155 --> 00:53:12,050
I'll bring up the beer.

1051
00:53:12,052 --> 00:53:13,701
Yes, okay.

1052
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:16,561
Then why don't you go to Daddy?
There he is.

1053
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:20,367
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

1054
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:23,576
Oh, so you're my daughter?

1055
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:24,596
You're surprised?

1056
00:53:24,596 --> 00:53:25,846
This way.

1057
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:29,489
Go on up and I'll bring the beer.

1058
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:33,239
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

1059
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,514
It was urgent and it just came out.

1060
00:53:38,304 --> 00:53:39,373
Whatever.

1061
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:43,135
Whatever. Don't worry about
the guy who lives recklessly.

1062
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:44,427
Go on up.

1063
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:46,034
- Sorry, Joon Ki.
- Don't touch me.

1064
00:53:46,034 --> 00:53:47,146
Sorry.

1065
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,679
Daughter?

1066
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,170
<i>What do I do?
It's getting thicker.</i>

1067
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,579
<i>If I get caught with this mustache,
it's over forever.</i>

1068
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:15,097
<i>I'm going insane.</i>

1069
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:20,952
So sleepy.

1070
00:54:21,617 --> 00:54:23,599
I'm so sleepy.

1071
00:54:25,402 --> 00:54:26,510
No.

1072
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,414
I can't sleep. I can never sleep.

1073
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,293
I must've dozed off.

1074
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,289
What is this? What are you doing?

1075
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:00,630
Seo Jin, it's nothing.
I just thought you'd get cold.

1076
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,028
I told you to get away.

1077
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:06,949
Senior! Senior!

1078
00:55:06,949 --> 00:55:08,277
Senior, please wake up.

1079
00:55:08,277 --> 00:55:10,938
Senior, I was wrong. I'm sorry.

1080
00:55:10,938 --> 00:55:12,969
Open your eyes.

1081
00:55:13,608 --> 00:55:16,487
Are you okay? Are you awake?

1082
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:17,990
Oh, my head hurts.

1083
00:55:18,405 --> 00:55:20,222
My head hurts... ouch.

1084
00:55:27,088 --> 00:55:30,056
Hey, you... mustache...

1085
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:37,103
I am really sorry!

1086
00:55:39,362 --> 00:55:41,393
I'm sorry.

1087
00:55:45,896 --> 00:55:48,626
The mood of the guest house is nice.
It's very cozy.

1088
00:55:49,925 --> 00:55:54,601
Doctor Han wants me to close it down
and focus on films.

1089
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,898
I just can't do that.

1090
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:59,119
I want to do it without her help.

1091
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,380
I want to succeed on my own.

1092
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,204
Ah, I see.

1093
00:56:04,204 --> 00:56:05,364
Sorry, Yoon Ah.

1094
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:08,579
I'm being too selfish.

1095
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:09,998
Not at all.

1096
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:15,978
<i>Emergency. Sol is crying in hunger.</i>

1097
00:56:15,978 --> 00:56:18,108
<i>Need your presence immediately.</i>

1098
00:56:19,563 --> 00:56:22,400
Sorry, but I need to use the bathroom.

1099
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:26,992
Here.

1100
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:29,619
Should we toast to your dreams, Dong Gu?

1101
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:30,653
Shall we?

1102
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:33,672
We're all out of beer though.

1103
00:56:33,672 --> 00:56:35,942
I'll get more.
I need to use the bathroom too.

1104
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:40,782
Yes.

1105
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:52,048
<i>Oh, is our Sol up?</i>

1106
00:56:52,048 --> 00:56:54,751
<i>Are you happy to see Mommy's nipple?</i>

1107
00:56:54,751 --> 00:56:57,744
<i>Oh, you're so happy.
Oh, my baby.</i>

1108
00:56:57,744 --> 00:57:03,570
Food. Food.
There you go.

1109
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,927
Joon Ki...

1110
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:10,297
Yoon Ah!

1111
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:12,266
What...

1112
00:57:13,356 --> 00:57:14,989
are you doing right now?

1113
00:57:15,896 --> 00:57:18,777
- Su Ah.
- Why are you...

1114
00:57:19,577 --> 00:57:23,027
Why are you breastfeeding Joon Ki's baby?

1115
00:57:24,063 --> 00:57:26,568
Oh no. I wasn't doing that.

1116
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,737
Sol hasn't changed her diaper.

1117
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,661
- Su Ah.
- Joon Ki.

1118
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:33,081
Why is Yoon Ah breastfeeding your baby?

1119
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:36,114
So, what happened is...

1120
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:38,797
She needs nutrients from breast milk.

1121
00:57:38,797 --> 00:57:41,148
Breast milk is best for babies.

1122
00:57:41,148 --> 00:57:44,117
Getting breast milk
from Dong Gu's girlfriend?

1123
00:57:44,117 --> 00:57:47,197
Wait! She's not a birth mom,
so why would she have breast milk?

1124
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:49,356
Right, she's not.

1125
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:54,019
When Yoon Ah is in a good mood,
she can gather her strength and--

1126
00:57:54,019 --> 00:57:55,186
What nonsense!

1127
00:57:55,186 --> 00:57:58,233
Yoon Ah, you tell me.
What's going on?

1128
00:57:58,233 --> 00:58:00,963
Well, the thing is...

1129
00:58:00,963 --> 00:58:03,954
Honestly, Sol is my daughter.

1130
00:58:03,954 --> 00:58:05,994
What? Your daughter?

1131
00:58:05,994 --> 00:58:07,177
You said she was yours.

1132
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:09,070
She was. No, she is.

1133
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,393
I thought your ex-girlfriend
left her here.

1134
00:58:11,393 --> 00:58:13,081
Then how is she Yoon Ah's daughter?

1135
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:16,275
Then is Yoon Ah your ex-girlfriend?
Does that make sense?

1136
00:58:22,393 --> 00:58:24,364
Why do you think it's nonsense?

1137
00:58:25,123 --> 00:58:27,425
There's nothing in the world
that's nonsense.

1138
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:30,313
It's merely evil ambition
that people want to hide.

1139
00:58:30,313 --> 00:58:32,277
What are you saying?

1140
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:35,188
Then Yoon Ah is your ex-girlfriend.

1141
00:58:35,188 --> 00:58:37,599
And this baby is yours and hers?

1142
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:40,827
I wanted to keep it a secret
until the end.

1143
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:42,434
Are you saying Dong Gu doesn't know?

1144
00:58:42,434 --> 00:58:46,496
I was going to tell the truth,
but struggled after breaking up with you.

1145
00:58:46,496 --> 00:58:48,349
I couldn't bear to tell him.

1146
00:58:48,878 --> 00:58:51,083
Yoon Ah, is this the truth?

1147
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:53,155
Actually...

1148
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,443
Shut up, you wench!

1149
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:56,639
You have nothing you can say
for yourself.

1150
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,349
This woman will stop at nothing
if she wants something.

1151
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:03,670
You're the only person who can save
Dong Gu from that devil.

1152
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,449
Please come back to Dong Gu.

1153
00:59:10,402 --> 00:59:11,686
Please.

1154
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,105
- Hey.
- Huh?

1155
00:59:14,105 --> 00:59:15,815
- Did you plan this with Dong Gu?
- No.

1156
00:59:15,815 --> 00:59:17,976
You know what happens
if you lie, don't you?

1157
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:20,224
Look at me and talk.

1158
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:22,014
You two planned it, right?

1159
00:59:22,014 --> 00:59:23,981
I don't think so.

1160
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:25,827
You little punk...

1161
00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:29,056
- Tell me properly!
- I will. I will.

1162
00:59:29,056 --> 00:59:31,987
- What is it?
- I can't tell you in little bits.

1163
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:34,177
I have to tell you the whole story.

1164
00:59:34,177 --> 00:59:35,438
- Tell me.
- This story...

1165
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:40,134
I still can't forget the night sky
from Doctor Han's home in Malibu.

1166
00:59:40,507 --> 00:59:44,858
It's as if gold dust
were thrown into the sky.

1167
00:59:46,547 --> 00:59:49,427
We should go on a couple's trip
when you have time.

1168
00:59:49,427 --> 00:59:51,048
I would like that.

1169
00:59:51,614 --> 00:59:52,753
Yes.

1170
00:59:53,284 --> 00:59:54,585
You're back?

1171
00:59:54,585 --> 00:59:57,626
Su Ah, I mentioned to Yoon Seok
he should make some time.

1172
00:59:57,626 --> 01:00:00,268
We are going to Doctor Han's home
in Malibu sometime.

1173
01:00:00,268 --> 01:00:01,623
You're okay with that, right?

1174
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,148
Why are you looking at me like that?

1175
01:00:05,148 --> 01:00:06,885
Is there something on my face?

1176
01:00:06,885 --> 01:00:09,867
No, on the back of your head.
I'll take it off for you.

1177
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:21,664
Su Ah, Su Ah.

1178
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:24,224
Su Ah, I was wrong.
I'm really sorry.

1179
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:26,585
Let go before I hit you again.

1180
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:28,054
Hold on, Su Ah.

1181
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:29,994
Why do you think I went so far?

1182
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:33,235
I really love you and
I don't want to break up.

1183
01:00:33,235 --> 01:00:35,503
Really, but what will you do?

1184
01:00:35,503 --> 01:00:38,364
Even the tiny sliver of goodwill I had
for you is completely gone.

1185
01:00:38,954 --> 01:00:41,494
I don't want to see your face again.

1186
01:00:41,494 --> 01:00:43,713
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

1187
01:00:45,597 --> 01:00:47,101
Su Ah, Su Ah.

1188
01:00:48,652 --> 01:00:49,769
Su Ah.

1189
01:01:08,954 --> 01:01:11,498
Dong Gu, stop drinking.

1190
01:01:11,498 --> 01:01:14,010
Stop drinking. You drank too much.

1191
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,896
Leave me alone!

1192
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:19,297
I'm going to drink and die.
Don't stop me!

1193
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:22,438
Things never turn out well when
he listens to you, Joon Ki.

1194
01:01:22,438 --> 01:01:24,722
Do you think I knew
it'd get this twisted?

1195
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,590
I'm going crazy.

1196
01:01:42,106 --> 01:01:45,603
The siblings are both
putting on a show tonight.

1197
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,525
Shut up, girl!

1198
01:01:49,525 --> 01:01:51,193
Senior Tae Hyun.

1199
01:01:51,193 --> 01:01:53,621
Su Ah!

1200
01:01:54,998 --> 01:01:56,465
So tiresome. Gosh.

1201
01:01:56,465 --> 01:01:58,021
Senior Tae Hyun.

1202
01:01:58,021 --> 01:02:00,440
Su Ah!

1203
01:02:01,532 --> 01:02:03,061
Come on down.

1204
01:02:03,061 --> 01:02:04,610
So noisy!

1205
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:07,110
Su Ah!

1206
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:13,313
Stop drinking. Stop.

1207
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,534
Su Ah! I'm going to drink!
