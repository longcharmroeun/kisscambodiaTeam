<i>Let's take a look at the back.</i>

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,687
<i>What do you think?</i>

9
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,876
<i>Your hips just seem to
lift up to the sky, don't they?</i>

10
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:33,186
<i>That is the strength of
this auto hip-up design.</i>

00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,951
<i>It's the very best quality.</i>

<i>You can exercise or walk in them

You don't believe me?

Then we'll test it for you.

17
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,988
Take a look.

18
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:51,880
Even though they stretch like this,
it isn't uncomfortable at all.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,838
You still don't believe me?

20
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:56,176
One, two, three.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,115
Oh no!

22
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,792
Um...

23
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:04,152
Geez.

24
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:13,010
Uh, today's product comes in
blue, black, and sky blue.

God and Buddha.

28
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:21,218
Please let me get
an interview at one place.

29
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:23,409
I'll go to church and temple.

30
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,159
Help me, merciful Buddha.

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,114
Amen.

32
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:30,331
Seo Jin, what are you doing?

33
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:32,873
Praying. I just applied for jobs.

34
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:35,215
I applied to 25 places.

35
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:37,774
I hope things work out for you.

36
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,272
Oh, it's that actor.

37
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:41,028
He's really good at acting.

38
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,076
What was his name again?

39
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:43,385
Lee...

40
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:45,561
Who? Mister Duk Hwa?

41
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:47,670
Mister Duk Hwa?
Do you actually know him?

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,423
That's Joon Ki's father.

43
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:51,968
What? Joon Ki's father?

44
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:53,679
That's really amazing.

45
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:56,111
I'm going to ask Joon Ki
for his father's autograph.

46
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:57,250
No, you can't.

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,138
Joon Ki doesn't like
to talk about his father.

48
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:02,307
- Why?
- The thing is...

49
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:04,840
- Mister Duk Hwa--
- I understand. Yes.

50
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:09,397
What is this? What's this mood here?

51
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:12,378
Is this because of me?

52
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:14,669
You were insulting me again,
weren't you?

53
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,978
What did you say,
you hairy woman?

54
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,001
It wasn't like that.

55
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,187
Tell me now if you
don't want to get into trouble.

56
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:21,961
Big news, big news!

57
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,770
Why are you making such a fuss?

58
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,913
- You're a total star. Look.
- Huh?

59
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:27,983
What is it?

60
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:29,925
"Who is the man on
the home shopping channel?"

61
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,437
Who am I?

62
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:32,693
What is that?

63
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,159
What are all of those?

64
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,628
Awesome.

65
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:39,028
What the heck are those?
What's that?

66
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,270
What is that! What?

67
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,668
Your face is all over the internet.

68
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:45,538
You even have a nickname.
Guess what it is.

69
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:47,830
Pink Boy. Hey, Pink Boy.

70
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,919
What boy?

71
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,415
- I should make one too.
- Close it.

72
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:55,575
They sure did great job Photoshopping.

73
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:58,383
Yes, hello.

74
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,813
Yes, yes... stop it.

75
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:04,526
Yes, that's me. Excuse me?

76
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:08,733
Yes, okay. Yes.

77
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:11,243
What was that call about?

78
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:12,616
It's a film production company.

79
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:15,014
They want to cast me.

80
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,705
They were impressed by me.

81
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:19,217
What? By you?
Where did they see you?

82
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:21,067
- Home shopping.
- Home shopping?

83
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,346
Don't tell me it was
the Pink Boy. No way.

84
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:26,998
Stop calling me that.

85
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,597
<i>[My Mom]</i>
Here.

86
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:30,455
It's the script and shooting schedule.

87
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:34,462
You're casting me without an audition?

88
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:36,717
Does it seem like I'm a fraud?

89
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,417
No, that's not what I meant.

90
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,504
What kind of role is it?

91
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:45,241
The film is about a mom
whose daughter is kidnapped.

92
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:47,305
She gets revenge on the kidnappers.

93
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:49,825
You'll be one of the kidnappers.

94
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:51,347
Then will I have lines,
by any chance?

95
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:52,920
Not many, but you have some.

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,717
You have a scene with the main character.

97
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:57,227
Who is playing the main character?

98
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:58,633
The main character?

99
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:01,079
Kim Hee Ja.

100
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,280
Kim Hee Ja!

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,426
Kim Hee Ja from "Desert"?

102
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:06,713
The nation's greatest actor, Kim Hee Ja?

103
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,125
Yes, that's right.

104
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,793
So you have to practice hard
on your acting, okay?

105
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,192
Yes, I'll work very hard.

106
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:15,866
Thank you!

107
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:23,110
How is it? Is it good?

108
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,911
Uh, yes.

109
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,380
It is good.

110
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,661
But when will we eat rice, Yoon Ah?

111
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:33,033
We've only been eating bread
for days, so I feel a little--

112
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,632
Just eat.

113
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:36,975
What if she suddenly gets mad again?

114
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:39,257
All right. I'll eat.

115
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:42,329
There's plenty. Take your time eating.

116
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,074
<i>You guys! You guys!</i>

117
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,151
Big news, big news, big news!

118
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:49,982
I got a role in a movie!

119
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:51,317
Guess who's starring in it.

120
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:53,440
The nation's greatest actor.

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,290
It's Kim Hee Ja, Kim Hee Ja!

122
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,642
Kim Hee Ja, for real?
What's your role this time?

123
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,052
I get murdered by Kim Hee Ja.

124
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:02,230
I knew it. It's another minor role.

125
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,062
I have lines this time though.

126
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:05,442
Regardless, that's good news.

127
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:07,201
Shouldn't we have a party to celebrate?

128
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,002
We should have a nice stew and rice.

129
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:11,992
Sorry, but I need to go over the script
and I don't have time.

130
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,706
Let's party next time.

131
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:16,225
- Kim Hee Ja!
- Joon Ki, I want rice.

132
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:18,069
He's so excited, isn't he?

133
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,500
Doo Shik, you dropped it.
Have a new one.

134
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,108
Thank you.

135
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,565
Hello!

136
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:36,096
You scared me.
I died because of you.

137
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,855
Oh, I'm sorry.

138
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,038
Did you practice a lot?

139
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,077
I didn't sleep for a week
and I practiced a lot.

140
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:42,500
Wow.

141
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,899
Where is Senior Kim Hee Ja anyway?

142
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,591
She'll be here soon.

143
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:48,276
There she is.

144
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,194
Senior Kim Hee Ja.

145
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:59,538
Senior, hello.

146
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,403
Why is she like that?

147
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:09,053
She's immersed into her role.

148
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,584
The sadness of a mother
whose daughter has been kidnapped.

149
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:16,502
So, she doesn't eat, sleep, or
go home during the whole shoot.

150
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,483
She says it breaks
the emotion of her character.

151
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:21,045
Anyway, it's amazing.

152
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,678
Hit him and strangle him.

153
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,286
Wow.

154
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:28,725
She truly does seem like
one of our nation's greatest.

155
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:33,882
This is the scene when the mom has
found one of the co-conspirators.

156
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:37,213
We'll show the anger of the mother
when she finally confronts him.

157
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,408
Also, the terror you feel
when you see her.

158
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:42,262
The angry mom will fight
with the kidnapper.

159
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,956
She is so overcome with anger
that she ends up murdering him.

160
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:45,995
Understand?

161
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:47,754
Okay. We'll rehearse it first.

162
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:49,244
Yes, Director.

163
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,411
Rehearsal, cue!

164
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:03,838
Who is it?

165
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,583
I said who is it? Who is it that...

166
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,466
How did you find me?

167
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:18,603
Where's my daughter?

168
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,403
Where's my daughter, Soo Jin?
Tell me, you bastard!

169
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:23,307
Oh, this is just a rehearsal.

170
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:25,166
What? Rehearsal?

171
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,317
Tell me! Where is Soo Jin?

172
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,995
Tell me!

173
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:34,584
Wait... hold on.

174
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,221
My daughter!

175
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,201
Hee Ja, stop! That's enough!

176
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,752
Joon Ki, wake up!

177
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,665
Wake up, wake up!

178
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,430
Are you okay?

179
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,459
A white tunnel and a black shadow.

180
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,437
Gosh, I thought something happened.

181
00:07:56,437 --> 00:08:00,278
Sorry, Director.
I was so in character.

182
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,918
Are you all right, Joon Ki?

183
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:05,257
Here.

184
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:07,242
Oh, I'm all right.

185
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:11,238
Director, I'm going to go calm myself.

186
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,675
My heart is racing.

187
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:17,625
Seriously, I told her to take it easy.

188
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,488
What if someone has to
go to the hospital again?

189
00:08:20,488 --> 00:08:21,521
The hospital?

190
00:08:21,521 --> 00:08:24,410
The person who had the role before you
ended up in the hospital.

191
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,990
He was beaten by Hee Ja
and was there for four weeks.

192
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,302
- What?
- So, be smart about how you get hit.

193
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:31,591
Got it?

194
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:36,264
Yes... okay.

195
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,750
Joon Ki, are you ready?

196
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,235
Yes, yes... yes.

197
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,513
Ready, action!

198
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:49,350
Wait.

199
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,124
How did you find me?

200
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:58,947
Where's my daughter?

201
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:01,307
Where is Soo Jin? Where?

202
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,683
Tell me!

203
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:05,764
Blood.

204
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:09,287
Wait, wait! That's metal... metal.

205
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:11,451
Where is she?

206
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:16,198
Cut.

207
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:17,957
Stop, stop, stop.

208
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:20,947
No, no, no.

209
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:23,177
- No, no!
- That's enough. Stop.

210
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:29,078
Wow.

211
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,558
Dong Gu, you filmed this?

212
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:32,817
Yes.

213
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:38,013
Wow, they made it so pretty.

214
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:40,022
Oh, look at the cute baby.

215
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:41,427
How cute.

216
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,259
Cute, yeah right.

217
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:46,379
After I started this job,
I believed in good and evil.

218
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,253
People are definitely born evil.

219
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,888
Hey, is that something
you should say about a baby?

220
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:53,086
You just haven't seen
kids crying their heads off.

221
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:56,596
When the baby starts crying,
the mom tells me to make him laugh.

222
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,859
I'm not a comedian.
How can I do that?

223
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:02,302
It's not so hard at all.

224
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,595
Then is it easy?

225
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:06,120
It is easy. Want to see?

226
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,342
Ah buru, buru, buru, buru, hwon!
(Gibberish)

227
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:16,072
Hwon.

228
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:18,630
What? She laughed right away.

229
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,413
What... what did you just say?

230
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,261
- Ah bu, what?
- Ah burubu hwon?

231
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,231
Ah burubu...

232
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:27,423
- Pong?
- Pong, pong.

233
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:29,880
Not, pong. It's hwon.

234
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,499
- Phong?
- No.

235
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,917
<i>Do, re, mi, fa, so...</i>

236
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,616
Use the "so" tone to say,
hwon, hwon.

237
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:38,804
Ah, hwon?

238
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,818
What else? Do you have more?

239
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:43,273
Something else? Hm.

240
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:44,722
Take Sol for me.

241
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:47,722
- Come on, Sol.
- Here you go.

242
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:49,919
Oh, Mommy's gone.

243
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,556
Where did Mommy go?

244
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:54,491
Here she is!

245
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:57,828
Awesome, awesome.

246
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:00,278
Wow, awesome.

247
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:03,789
"Where did Mommy go?
Here she is."

248
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,924
You have to raise your tone
for this a little more.

249
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:07,576
- At a C tone.
- C tone.

250
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:09,583
- Here she is.
- Here she is.

251
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:14,019
- That's it.
- Here she is. C tone.

252
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,799
I'm home.

253
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,889
You're home...

254
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,182
Why do you look like that?

255
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:20,110
It's from the shoot.

256
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:22,683
I got injured.

257
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,158
What kind of shoot was it
that you got this injured?

258
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:29,101
Senior Kim Hee Ja really gets
immersed into her roles.

259
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:32,284
Even if she gets immersed into her roles,
she can't beat people like this.

260
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:34,827
She could end up killing a person.

261
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,702
It's all right.
It was during acting.

262
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:39,695
I'm fine. I'm...

263
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,839
Joon Ki, Joon Ki?

264
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,928
Is he asleep right now?

265
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:50,119
Is he breathing?

266
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:53,538
Goodness,
what a tumultuous life he lives.

267
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,234
He really does.

268
00:11:56,976 --> 00:12:01,269
A white tunnel and a black shadow.

269
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:06,158
Is he talking in his sleep?

270
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,614
What's he saying?

271
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:09,475
- Are you okay?
- No, don't!

272
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:11,956
Save me. Please save me.

273
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:19,994
We'll continue shooting
yesterday's scene today.

274
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:24,437
After killing the kidnapper,
the mom is sobbing like crazy.

275
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,662
Joon Ki, you're dead,
so you cannot move. You got it?

276
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:30,230
- Yes.
- Shall we start then?

277
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:47,399
Ready, action!

278
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,951
Where's my daughter?

279
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,359
Where's my Soo Jin?

280
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:02,056
Where's my daughter, Soo Jin?

281
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,628
Tell me.

282
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,285
- Tell me!
- I can't.

283
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,631
Where is she, huh?

284
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:19,192
Where is my daughter?

285
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:21,611
You bastard.

286
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:24,345
Where is she? Tell me.

287
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:28,162
Where is she?

288
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:43,866
Cut! Okay, that was good.

289
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:46,331
Oh my.

290
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,678
Hee Ja, that was great acting.

291
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:52,331
I got goosebumps everywhere
while watching you.

292
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,208
Joon Ki, you were good too.

293
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,229
I was nervous we'd have to cut.

294
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,399
Wow, you were able to
hold on through that.

295
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,888
Thank you.

296
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:02,374
I'll be going to the bathroom now.

297
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,019
What do you think about him?
Better than expected, right?

298
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,620
I suppose so.

299
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,649
He's a good actor and
I like a junior who can act.

300
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:16,769
Where did you find someone like that?

301
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,144
Oh, him?

302
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:20,798
The thing is...

303
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,788
Oh, I thought I was going to die.

304
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:38,462
Why did it have to go in my mouth?

305
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:45,765
Joon Ki, he said you did well!

306
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:49,285
The world is finally recognizing
my acting talent.

307
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,774
Hello.

308
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:54,258
Thank you.

309
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:00,342
Why is he acting up today?

310
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:02,535
He hasn't been well since morning.

311
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,336
Ma'am, I'll take some pictures of
Jang Goon before we start.

312
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:09,225
Jang Goon isn't feeling so well now.
What can we do about that?

313
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:10,674
About that, Mister...

314
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,279
You want me to make him laugh?

315
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,461
How did you know?

316
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:16,114
When people look at me like that,
they all say the same thing.

317
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:17,549
I'll give it a try.

318
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,567
<i>Do, re, mi, fa, so...</i>

319
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:33,049
Ah buru, buru, buru, hwon.

320
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,342
What are you doing?
He's crying even more.

321
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,126
It's okay. I have one more.

322
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:40,105
Jang Goon, Uncle is gone.

323
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,986
Where did Uncle go?

324
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:44,513
Here he is!

325
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:46,264
What are you doing?

326
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:48,205
He's going to throw a fit.

327
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:50,375
Jang Goon, it's okay. It's all right.

328
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,222
That's weird.
It worked well for Yoon Ah.

329
00:15:53,222 --> 00:15:54,975
What should I do?

330
00:15:54,975 --> 00:16:00,466
Ah buru, buru, buru, buru, hwon.

331
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:04,004
Where did Auntie go?
Where did Auntie go?

332
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,585
Here I am.

333
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:07,572
Oh my.

334
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:09,950
He's laughing just fine.

335
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,630
You told me to come out
right away for this?

336
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,552
That's strange.
He cried when I did it.

337
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:20,546
You're very good with babies.
I feel at ease now.

338
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,505
- Ouch. My stomach hurts.
- It hurts again?

339
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:25,298
This won't do.
Let's go to the hospital.

340
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:26,783
What about Jang Goon?

341
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,586
Your mother will be here soon.

342
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,336
I'll watch the baby.
You should go.

343
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:33,158
Could you do that for me?

344
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,543
I'm sorry, but can you get him
changed into these clothes too?

345
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:37,760
Sure.

346
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't worry. I'll watch over him.

347
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,672
Thank you for your help.

348
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:43,186
Go on.

349
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,885
What a strange kid.

350
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,505
I did the same thing.
What's the difference?

351
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:51,842
Babies apparently know the
difference between good and bad people.

352
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,498
So, are you saying I'm a bad person?

353
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:56,087
Not necessarily.

354
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:58,673
I'll be in the restroom,
so keep an eye on him.

355
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,570
Oh, this is so pretty.

356
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,755
I wonder how much all of this costs.

357
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,250
Oh yeah.
I have to change his clothes.

358
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,002
Here we go.

359
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,526
Oh my gosh. It's so cute.

360
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:21,897
It would look so cute
on my Sol too. Right, Sol?

361
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:23,438
Look, look.

362
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:32,656
What did I say about liking the work?

363
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:33,951
Director, thanks for everything.

364
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,857
Yes, good job. Good job.

365
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:38,942
Okay, we finished the shoot well.

366
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,202
Let's all go out for pork belly and soju!

367
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:43,255
Sounds good!

368
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:45,030
Come with us.

369
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,619
Will you be going too, Senior?

370
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,633
Why I am your senior?

371
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,401
I'm tired, so I'll head in first.

372
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,644
What's wrong?

373
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:02,835
- Did I offend her somehow?
- No.

374
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:05,705
Hee Ja, Hee Ja!

375
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:11,532
Hee Ja, Hee Ja!
How can you leave like this?

376
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:13,701
I'm not in the mood to go out.

377
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,055
Because of what I said earlier?

378
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:18,941
I really hate kids who act up
because they have people who back them.

379
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:20,602
You know very well, Hee Ja.

380
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:23,050
Duk Hwa helped me a lot
through my hard times.

381
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,300
He asked me to cast his son.
How could I say no?

382
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,230
What are you talking about?

383
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,791
Joon Ki, it's not that.

384
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,417
What did you just say?

385
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:42,080
My daughter, look over here.

386
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,578
Oh, don't you look so pretty.

387
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,798
Look this way.
That's right. Look over here.

388
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:50,047
- What are you doing?
- You scared me!

389
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,209
Why are you so startled?

390
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,178
Why are you taking photos
of a stranger's baby?

391
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:55,535
I thought it was Sol from afar.

392
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,997
It's Sol.

393
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:01,885
What's going on here, Yoon Ah?

394
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:03,251
- Well, actually--
- Wait.

395
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:05,060
What if the parents come?

396
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,941
I'm sorry. Actually, I just--

397
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:08,743
It doesn't matter.
Just change her clothes.

398
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:09,808
- Okay.
- Gosh.

399
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,050
Jang Goon!

400
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,373
Come here.

401
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:19,761
Oh, my Jang Goon.
My baby, Jang Goon.

402
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:21,550
It's been a long time.

403
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,635
Your grandma has been living in the US.

404
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:27,723
I haven't seen you since you were born.
We finally meet again.

405
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:30,917
- Oh my.
- He is so handsome.

406
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,932
Why has he lost so much weight though?

407
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:39,511
He had chubby cheeks in the pictures,
but he's lost the weight.

408
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,243
I doubt that.

409
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:44,799
And you are?

410
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,386
Oh, I'm here to photograph
and film the event.

411
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,335
- Oh.
- Grandma, you must be tired.

412
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:52,555
- We'll hold on to him.
- I'm just fine.

413
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:56,994
It's been ages since
I've held my Jang Goon.

414
00:19:56,994 --> 00:20:00,596
In our Gyeongju Lee clan

415
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:02,704
he is the only son
out of eight generations.

416
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:05,546
Just to have a son...

417
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:10,516
his parents had to go to fertility
clinics and go through so much.

418
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:12,862
I have to interview you, Grandma.

419
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:14,590
You need to say something
to your grandson.

420
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,250
- Give Jang Goon to us.
- All right.

421
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,779
I'll hold him and do it.

422
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:20,858
It looks nicer to hold him
during the interview.

423
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:23,083
Oh, you can't do that.

424
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:28,510
How crazy is this?

425
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,261
Oh, did you poop, Jang Goon?

426
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:32,673
Wait just a moment.

427
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:35,065
Grandma will change
your diaper, Jang Goon.

428
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,386
No, no. We'll do that.

429
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:39,878
Babies these days have
very toxic poo smells.

430
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:41,679
- I'll do it.
- Oh no.

431
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,990
I'm going to change it.

432
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,050
Let me take a look at
my baby's little penis.

433
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,163
- Penis?
- You're going to look at his penis?

434
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:56,259
Oh my. Let's see my Jang Goon's pee pee.

435
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:58,241
Let's see here.

436
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,026
Get that off.

437
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,320
What do you think you're doing?

438
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,299
Even if he is a baby,
shouldn't you protect his privacy?

439
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,861
Privacy for a baby? Nonsense.

440
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,209
Oh? What's with you?

441
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:19,307
Grandma, he may be young,
but please respect Jang Goon's rights.

442
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:20,416
This is a violation of rights.

443
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:24,394
Violation of rights? What in the world...

444
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:28,877
Why, you little punk.

445
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:31,368
Are you playing around here or what?

446
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:33,119
It's because I have a trauma.

447
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,430
My grandma always said,
"Let's eat that penis."

448
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,558
To this day,
I still can't eat peppers.

449
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,782
What kind of nonsense is that?

450
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:45,634
- You can't.
- Hey.

451
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:48,404
Move your hand.
You're not going to move it?

452
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:50,413
Move it. Move, move!

453
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:52,417
No! No, I can't.

454
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:54,297
Look at this punk.

455
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:55,700
Hey!

456
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:57,951
You little rascal.

457
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,778
No. You can't, Grandma.

458
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,441
You should've moved when I told you to.

459
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:04,335
No. You have to stop, Grandma!

460
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:07,603
All right. Let me take a look...

461
00:22:22,713 --> 00:22:23,957
What...

462
00:22:25,188 --> 00:22:26,866
What is this?

463
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:30,067
My Jang Goon...

464
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,932
His pe...pe... penis.

465
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:35,496
Oh no! Grandma.

466
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:38,223
- What do we do?
- Sol!

467
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:53,185
What brings you by
without even a call?

468
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:54,874
Why did you do it?

469
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:57,017
Why did you do it again?

470
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:59,028
What are you talking about
out of the blue?

471
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:01,394
I heard everything from Director Kim.

472
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:04,984
I told you not to do that anymore.

473
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,409
I'm trying my best on my own.

474
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,877
- Why do you keep doing it?
- Then...

475
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:13,121
you should do well on your own.

476
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:17,519
Yeah, I enjoyed watching you
on home shopping a few days ago.

477
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,743
Gosh, it was so embarrassing.

478
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:24,095
Yes, I asked for a favor.

479
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:27,971
I don't like to see
my only child suffering.

480
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,575
What's so wrong about that?

481
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,141
I can't be proud about it.

482
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:33,174
Why not?

483
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:35,288
Because I'm your son.

484
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:39,641
I'm the son of the person I respect most,
actor Lee Duk Hwa.

485
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,230
So, I need to do this more honorably.

486
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,430
I want to succeed on my own
without your help.

487
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,490
That way, I can feel
truly proud around you.

488
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,890
So, just trust me, Father.

489
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,873
Watch over me.

490
00:23:56,873 --> 00:24:00,107
That's all I want from you.

491
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,077
I understand what you mean...

492
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:06,068
All right, fine.
Go on home shopping.

493
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:07,890
Or play minor roles forever.

494
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,673
Do whatever you want.

495
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:11,287
Gosh, kid.

496
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:13,484
Also, you...

497
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:16,131
What's with the pink underwear? Pink?

498
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:17,473
You're a man.

499
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:18,519
It's sexy.

500
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,901
My goodness.

501
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:24,230
All right. Let's go inside.

502
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,182
Come in and have dinner before going.

503
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:27,352
No, Father.

504
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:30,416
I have to do something, so I have to go.

505
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:34,943
Hey, kid. Hey!

506
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:38,929
All right.

507
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:41,828
I sure did raise him well.

508
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:51,960
I'm sorry for everything.

509
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,786
Joon Ki, it's not like you knew.

510
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:57,153
Whether I knew or not,
it's all my fault.

511
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:58,511
I'm sorry.

512
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:01,865
Thank you for the meal.

513
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:03,628
I'll get going, Sir.

514
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:07,003
Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

515
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:09,955
Gosh, that kid.

516
00:25:12,164 --> 00:25:14,996
Yes, Tae Shik.
How about the grandma?

517
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:18,096
Really? That's a relief.

518
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm sorry about today.
I'll take responsibility for all of it.

519
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,174
I'm really sorry. Yeah.

520
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:29,750
What happened? Was it resolved?

521
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,372
Yeah, somewhat.

522
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:34,288
What were you thinking when you did that?

523
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:35,358
I'm sorry.

524
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:39,212
Sorry or not, how could you do that
at someone's 100 day baby event?

525
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,732
I did it because I was sorry.

526
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:44,525
I was sorry to Sol.

527
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:52,950
My Sol was born to
a mom who is so lacking.

528
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:57,902
She never got to celebrate her birth.

529
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:04,000
She never got pretty clothes
or nice toys.

530
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,269
So, I just wanted a picture
of a 100 day celebration.

531
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:13,058
I'm very sorry.

532
00:26:21,675 --> 00:26:23,778
The product we have for you today

533
00:26:23,778 --> 00:26:27,130
is a bright, bright smile corrector.

534
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,844
Wear it only three minutes per day.

535
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:31,771
And it will give you
a naturally beautiful smile.

536
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:33,773
How does it feel to wear it?

537
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:37,467
It feels like my smile
is coming into place.

538
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,867
You feel your smile
coming into place naturally?

539
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:44,114
Could you tell us in detail how
your smile is coming into place?

540
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:47,509
- In detail?
- Yes, in detail.

541
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:49,137
Very detailed.

542
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,005
How can I put it?

543
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:56,618
Usually, my lips turn down.

544
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:59,381
Wearing this makes my mouth turn up.

545
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:04,327
So, my smile feels more natural.

546
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:09,688
What the heck is this?

547
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:13,595
It was hard enough as it is.
Why do they make me talk?

548
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:17,067
Gosh, my mouth hurts.

549
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,218
Wait, is this going to be captured too?

550
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:21,346
Is this all over the internet?

551
00:27:21,346 --> 00:27:23,192
Darn it!

552
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,432
Who is it now?

553
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:30,932
Hello?

554
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:34,028
Yes, this is Lee Joon Ki.

555
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:36,290
What?

556
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:38,724
A meeting?

557
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:53,057
Excuse me.

558
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:55,174
- Leave it here.
- Okay.

559
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,988
No, it's not that.

560
00:27:56,988 --> 00:28:00,083
My name is Lee Joon Ki
and I received a call.

561
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:03,435
Ah, welcome.

562
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,396
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, you too.

563
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:08,217
Why did you ask to see me, Director?

564
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:11,057
Oh, I'm starting a morning drama soon.

565
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,814
Someone recommended you to me.

566
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:14,361
Recommended me?

567
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,934
Who?

568
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,404
Who recommended me?

569
00:28:19,404 --> 00:28:20,582
I did.

570
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:22,309
Oh, she's here.

571
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:25,099
Senior!

572
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:27,576
- Hello.
- Nice to see you.

573
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:29,143
Hello, Senior.

574
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:30,843
But, why would you recommend me?

575
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:34,272
Director Choi was looking for a new
actor who is handsome and can act.

576
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:36,952
Your looks aren't that great,
but you can act.

577
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:38,584
That's why I recommended you.

578
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:41,824
- Why? You don't like it?
- Not at all.

579
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:42,943
Thank you, Senior!

580
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:45,755
Use your skills to get the role.

581
00:28:45,755 --> 00:28:47,820
- Work hard.
- Okay.

582
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,028
Hee Ja, take a look at
this script for my drama.

583
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:52,096
Thank you, Senior!

584
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,516
I'll call you.

585
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:06,184
Yoon Ah... come out for a bit.

586
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,701
Why? What is it?

587
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:10,618
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da.

588
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:11,915
Ta-da.

589
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:16,592
<i>[Happy 100 Days, Sol!]</i>

590
00:29:19,545 --> 00:29:21,375
<i>[Sol, congrats on 100 days!]</i>

591
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:27,153
What is this?

592
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:31,444
What else? Come over here.

593
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:34,521
This is Sol's 100 day party.

594
00:29:36,013 --> 00:29:38,807
We didn't do much,
but we made it ourselves.

595
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:40,828
Please understand
even if you don't love everything.

596
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:42,384
That's not it.

597
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:45,308
Everything's so pretty.

598
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:46,968
Thank you, everyone.

599
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:48,326
It was nothing.

600
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:50,548
You should thank Dong Gu, not us.

601
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:52,439
It was all his idea.

602
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,643
No need to mention that.

603
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:57,476
Really? Thank you, Dong Gu.

604
00:29:57,476 --> 00:30:00,550
I was just worried
that you'd cause trouble again.

605
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:04,356
And stop crying over nothing, would you?

606
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:07,365
Crying like that is a bad habit.

607
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:08,989
I'm sorry.

608
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:11,886
It's just so pretty.

609
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,340
But there's no cake.

610
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,692
It would've been perfect with cake.

611
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:25,400
The cake has arrived!

612
00:30:25,938 --> 00:30:27,810
Of course, we prepared cake.

613
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,330
Did you think we'd have
a party without cake?

614
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:34,211
- Thank you.
- There she goes again. Look, look...

615
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,968
Seo Jin, light the candles
before it's a sea of tears.

616
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,148
Okay.

617
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,328
You bought champagne too?

618
00:30:40,328 --> 00:30:42,336
Oh, you have great sense.

619
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:44,234
Hey, this is to congratulate myself.

620
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:45,318
For what?

621
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:49,039
I got cast in a morning drama.

622
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,838
It's a regular character, at that!

623
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:53,240
Wow.

624
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,368
Regular? Really?

625
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:58,070
This time I'm the driver
for the main character.

626
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,226
I knew it.

627
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:00,964
You're a minor role again.

628
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:03,736
Okay, let's talk later.

629
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,626
Take the picture for now.

630
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:07,145
Let's go. Let's go.

631
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,845
Yoon Ah, over here.

632
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:10,836
Everyone, get together.

633
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,119
Let's take a picture, Sol.

634
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,430
Okay, get into your places.

635
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,672
Dong Gu, hurry it up.

636
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:18,450
- Smile, would you?
- Okay.

637
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,859
This will go off in 10 seconds,
so get ready and pose.

638
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:24,176
Did you light it? Kimchi!

639
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,296
All right, now.

640
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:27,464
Kimchi!

641
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:29,189
Wait.

642
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:32,141
Now that I think about it,
there's no 100 day ring.

643
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,589
It really would've been perfect
if we had a ring for Sol.

644
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:38,115
- Yoon Ah.
- Seo Jin, go buy a ring.

645
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:39,915
Why did you bother buying these?

646
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:41,282
Get rid of these.

647
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:42,407
Get rid of the table.

648
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:43,906
- Get rid of it all.
- Okay, okay.

649
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:45,839
- Buy the ring.
- No, no.

650
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:54,843
Okay, let's get started.

651
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,375
I'll make a left turn.

652
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,998
Oh, I'll make a right turn.

653
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:06,249
Yes, I'll reverse.

654
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,534
There's this version.

655
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,018
I'll make a left turn.

656
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:16,688
Oh, I'll make a right turn.

657
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:19,622
Yes, I'll reverse.

658
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,186
There's this version too.
Which one is better?

659
00:32:23,186 --> 00:32:24,568
Be brutally honest.

660
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,065
What's different?
They seem the same.

661
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:31,182
What?

662
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:36,336
The first driver was one that
worked diligently no matter what.

663
00:32:36,336 --> 00:32:39,493
He was someone who wanted to
make something of himself.

664
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:42,711
The second one was tired and annoyed,
but going along with his boss.

665
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,963
He was a driver who was
just doing his job carelessly.

666
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:48,644
Ah, was that it?

667
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:49,775
You want to be a director.

668
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:51,731
Yet, you can't tell the difference.
What will you do?

669
00:32:51,731 --> 00:32:53,509
Sorry.

670
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:56,289
Gosh, this is my first regular drama.

671
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:57,455
This is a big issue.

672
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:58,470
I know.

673
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,413
Should I find a driver
and ask about the job?

674
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:04,468
You only have three lines.
Why bother doing that?

675
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:06,220
You're going overboard.

676
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,377
Just let him do what he wants.

677
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:10,307
Do you know anything about acting?

678
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:12,298
Oh, what's that, Yoon Ah?

679
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:15,459
Someone threw out a perfectly
fine toaster oven on the street.

680
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:16,616
I brought it here.

681
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:18,476
Toaster oven? Why do you need that?

682
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,925
You said that I could probably
sell the bread I make.

683
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:23,500
So, I want to try selling it.

684
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,146
Sales? Then what about
working at the guest house?

685
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,815
I'll do my work here
and do it on my time off.

686
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:30,515
Do what you want, then.

687
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:33,944
But it can't get in the way of
your work, okay?

688
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,409
Don't worry. It won't.

689
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:36,998
Goodness.

690
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,525
Oh no!

691
00:33:41,276 --> 00:33:42,710
Sorry.

692
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:52,343
<i>[That Man, That Woman's Story]</i>

693
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,263
<i>[Daeyoung Daily: You have a new message]</i>

694
00:33:58,263 --> 00:34:00,932
- Dae... Dae... Dae...
- Open it.

695
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:03,789
Geez.

696
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:05,479
- Joon Ki.
- Yeah?

697
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:09,376
I'm just too nervous.
Can you look for me?

698
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:10,583
Okay.

699
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,822
What happened?

700
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,820
Oh, what are you going to do?

701
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,304
Seo Jin.

702
00:34:25,322 --> 00:34:26,789
The interview...

703
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:30,157
They want you to come.

704
00:34:30,157 --> 00:34:32,045
You passed!

705
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:34,083
Really? Is it for real?

706
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,284
Yes, take a look.

707
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:39,275
<i>[Congratulations on passing...]</i>

708
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,059
It says I passed!

709
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:43,791
You still have to do the interview.

710
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,121
Don't get so emotional yet.

711
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:48,380
I don't care.
I just really want to work here.

712
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,590
Congratulations.

713
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,713
You can work there then.

714
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,878
Stop crying. You look ugly.

715
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,224
I smell something burning.

716
00:34:57,224 --> 00:34:59,204
I think it's from the kitchen.

717
00:34:59,204 --> 00:35:00,494
What is this?

718
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:02,550
What is this? What's all this smoke?

719
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,601
What's this smoke?

720
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,291
- What is this?
- There's smoke!

721
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,652
Oh no! My bread in the oven's burning.

722
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:09,650
- Then turn it off now!
- What?

723
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,193
What's wrong with this?
I can't turn it off.

724
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:14,322
This thing.

725
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,202
You can just unplug it.

726
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:19,253
You could've caused a big problem.

727
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:21,668
I think the timer broke.

728
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:24,556
Why would they throw out a broken thing?

729
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:28,813
They threw it out because it is broken.

730
00:35:28,813 --> 00:35:30,409
- Ah...
- What do you mean "ah"?

731
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:34,461
You almost started a fire!
Why do you like these things?

732
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:37,027
Seo Jin got an interview.
Let's go have a celebratory drink.

733
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:38,512
Seo Jin, let's go.

734
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,585
That's enough now.

735
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:42,023
- Seo Jin got an interview.
- Let's go.

736
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:47,797
Yoon Ah, we should go too.

737
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:50,128
No, I'm going to clean up here first.

738
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:51,692
Oh, really?

739
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,690
Then clean up and come up.

740
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:11,322
<i>Okay, then I'll get started.</i>

741
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:13,547
Spin it, man. Hurry up and spin it!

742
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,137
Whoa!

743
00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:18,248
Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

744
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:20,157
It's me. Okay, okay.

745
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:23,012
Ask me anything.
I'll answer whatever you ask.

746
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,054
Who wants to go first?

747
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:26,132
- Me.
- Oh! Me, me, me, me!

748
00:36:26,132 --> 00:36:29,235
- I want ask.
- Go ahead.

749
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:31,985
When, who,
and how was your first kiss?

750
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:36,074
Was my first kiss in grade nine?

751
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:38,288
No, it was in grade two.

752
00:36:38,288 --> 00:36:42,367
It was on the playground
with an older neighbor of mine.

753
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,936
I was coming down the elephant slide.

754
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,797
It was so hot.

755
00:36:47,797 --> 00:36:51,396
Wow, Shi Yeon's lips were so hot.

756
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:53,467
- Enough, enough.
- All right.

757
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:54,840
I don't want to hear anymore.

758
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,387
What happened next? What next?

759
00:36:56,387 --> 00:36:58,672
You asked me first. Be quiet.

760
00:36:58,672 --> 00:36:59,847
It was Shi Yeon.

761
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,282
I cut some fruit. Have some.

762
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:04,213
Did you clean the kitchen?

763
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:05,583
Yes, I did.

764
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,422
All the smoke is gone,
as well as the smell?

765
00:37:07,422 --> 00:37:10,527
Stop harassing her.
Yoon Ah, sit down.

766
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:13,532
- It's okay.
- Sit down. We're playing the truth game.

767
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:14,862
Play with us.

768
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:17,181
You can't refuse us.

769
00:37:18,242 --> 00:37:19,878
Then should I?

770
00:37:19,878 --> 00:37:22,144
Okay, I'm going to spin it again.

771
00:37:22,144 --> 00:37:24,570
Go, go, go, go!

772
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,239
Yeah, Yoon Ah got chosen
as soon as she joined us.

773
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,992
What should we ask Yoon Ah?

774
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:33,498
Me, me, me, me, me!

775
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:35,275
- I want to do it.
- Is she a vending machine?

776
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:37,423
I have a question
I really want to ask Yoon Ah.

777
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,590
Really? What is it?

778
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:43,092
Well, it's actually...

779
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:46,780
What happened with Sol's dad?

780
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:54,079
Why would you ask something like that
and make her uncomfortable?

781
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,224
Why not? You're all curious.

782
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:59,539
You're all just unable to ask, right?

783
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:03,012
It's okay. It's not a secret or anything.

784
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,920
Where should I start?

785
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:13,867
It's okay. It's not a secret or anything.

786
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:16,815
Where should I start?

787
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:23,634
To be honest...

788
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:30,708
That's what happened.

789
00:38:31,418 --> 00:38:36,018
So, your parents died in a fire
when you were two years old.

790
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:38,717
And you stayed with relatives.

791
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:42,686
Those relatives just took the insurance
money and left you in an orphanage?

792
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:46,266
Then you were abused by the
director of the orphanage.

793
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:49,547
You ran away, worked part-time,
and met Sol's dad?

794
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:52,398
You broke up because Sol's dad's
family didn't approve of you.

795
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:56,260
You then found out you were
pregnant after you broke up?

796
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,795
Hold on.

797
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:05,135
Then Sol's dad knew you were pregnant
and turned his back on you?

798
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:08,414
No, he doesn't know that Sol exists.

799
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:09,780
Why not?

800
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:12,054
Huh?

801
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:13,500
Well...

802
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:18,398
Sol must be awake.
I'm going downstairs.

803
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:24,467
I feel so bad for Yoon Ah.

804
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,324
It must've been so hard for her
all this time.

805
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:30,465
You! Be good to Yoon Ah
and stop lecturing her.

806
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:32,710
When did I do that?

807
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,088
You were about to eat her alive
about the fire thing just now.

808
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:38,878
I was just... cautioning her.

809
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,233
You're cautioned.
We're going to drink to ourselves.

810
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:42,565
Cheers!

811
00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:53,797
Guys! Ta-da.

812
00:39:53,797 --> 00:39:55,577
How do I look?

813
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:57,936
Wow. Awesome!

814
00:39:57,936 --> 00:39:59,998
It totally doesn't suit you.

815
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,056
It's hard for that outfit
not to suit you.

816
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:05,150
I'm stupid for asking you guys.

817
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,717
We're just joking.

818
00:40:06,717 --> 00:40:08,860
Why are you dressed up?

819
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,322
I have my interview today.

820
00:40:10,322 --> 00:40:13,431
I'm getting nervous seeing you
acting up like this.

821
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:15,581
Don't you two worry.

822
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,873
Now, should I get started on my makeup?

823
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:20,286
Oh no!

824
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,349
What do I do? What do I do?

825
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:26,807
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

826
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:29,019
It's almost time for my interview.
What is this?

827
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:31,891
Don't cause such a scene.
Change into something else.

828
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:34,981
I can't because this jacket
and blouse are a set.

829
00:40:34,981 --> 00:40:36,722
Other blouses don't match.

830
00:40:36,722 --> 00:40:38,760
Wash it and dry it quickly.
You still have time.

831
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,485
I'd better do that.

832
00:40:45,686 --> 00:40:47,905
What are you doing, Yoon Ah?

833
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:50,085
You said you're selling
muffins today, right?

834
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:52,117
- Yes.
- Should we help you?

835
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,487
No, I'm almost done.

836
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,753
I'm all done.

837
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,195
Oh, Sol must be awake.

838
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:07,824
Watching the baby,
doing housework, and selling muffins.

839
00:41:07,824 --> 00:41:10,784
Yoon Ah is working too hard.

840
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:12,335
You're right.

841
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:15,349
Hey, is there any way
that we can help Yoon Ah?

842
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:18,347
I wish we could,
but there's nothing we can do.

843
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:21,259
We can't make her a husband.

844
00:41:22,387 --> 00:41:23,594
That's not a bad idea.

845
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:25,586
Should we try looking for Sol's dad?

846
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:27,717
We don't know who he is, so how can we?

847
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:30,815
That's true. How would we find him?

848
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:36,898
Isn't this Yoon Ah's phone?

849
00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:38,077
I think so.

850
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:39,681
We can look for his number.

851
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:41,936
How can we know who he is
out of all these numbers?

852
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:43,766
We can just look.

853
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,934
- What is this?
- What?

854
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:51,518
Her contact list is only us,
a Chinese food place, and Kim Joon Sung.

855
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:53,782
Kim Joon Sung must be Sol's dad.

856
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:55,054
Does that make sense?

857
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,432
Then is the
Great Wall of China Sol's dad?

858
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:59,119
No, I'm saying how do we know
this is Sol's dad?

859
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,181
That's true.

860
00:42:00,181 --> 00:42:02,231
I can call him.

861
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:03,648
- Call him.
- You're crazy.

862
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:05,048
What will you do once you call?

863
00:42:05,048 --> 00:42:06,668
Let go. I'm just going to try.

864
00:42:06,668 --> 00:42:09,989
You're causing trouble again. Geez.

865
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:15,516
<i>Hello.</i>

866
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:19,188
Hello, is this
Kim Joon Sung's cell phone?

867
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:20,668
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>
- Stop it.

868
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:23,458
Do you know someone named Han Yoon Ah?

869
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,827
<i>I dated her for a bit.
Who is this?</i>

870
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:30,007
He says he dated her.
He dated her. It's him. It's him.

871
00:42:31,427 --> 00:42:33,226
Oh, this is a delivery company.

872
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:36,456
Han Yoon Ah sent you a package.

873
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:38,608
What is your home address?

874
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:41,469
It rained and the address got erased.
I can't see a thing.

875
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:42,851
It's so sunny out.

876
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,139
Yes, yes. One moment.

877
00:42:45,782 --> 00:42:48,001
35 Dongsangri.

878
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,822
Yes, I'll send the package.

879
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:53,121
It's him. It's Sol's dad.

880
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:55,393
We have his address.
Should we look for him?

881
00:42:55,393 --> 00:42:56,905
This doesn't seem right.

882
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:59,996
You stay out of it.
I'll go alone. You have no loyalty.

883
00:42:59,996 --> 00:43:02,054
All right, I'll go. I'll go with you.

884
00:43:02,054 --> 00:43:03,367
Where are you two going now?

885
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:04,938
- You don't need to know!
- What?

886
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,369
- Loyalty!
- What's with them?

887
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:09,322
What kind of trouble are they up to now?

888
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,630
- Are you going out?
- To sell my muffins.

889
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,088
You're really doing that?

890
00:43:14,088 --> 00:43:16,137
Sales are not for everyone.

891
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:17,998
I still want to try.

892
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:19,507
Wait, wait.

893
00:43:19,507 --> 00:43:20,907
You want me to carry that?

894
00:43:20,907 --> 00:43:23,449
No, I can do it alone. I'll be going.

895
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:26,298
I think it'll be hard alone.

896
00:43:26,298 --> 00:43:29,804
Goodness, why do that with a baby in tow?

897
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:32,949
Whatever, don't worry about it.

898
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:41,193
Buy some muffins!
They're handmade muffins!

899
00:43:41,193 --> 00:43:42,481
Muffins...

900
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:46,215
Buy some muffins!
They're handmade muffins.

901
00:43:46,215 --> 00:43:50,195
Hello. These are handmade muffins.

902
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,465
Welcome.

903
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:04,554
Dong Gu? What are you doing here?

904
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:06,719
I saw you while passing by.

905
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,373
How are sales going?

906
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:13,054
I can see by your face
that it's not going well.

907
00:44:13,054 --> 00:44:14,746
What is this?

908
00:44:14,746 --> 00:44:16,713
Baby is suffering
and the mom is suffering too.

909
00:44:16,713 --> 00:44:19,206
Not just anyone can do sales.

910
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:22,985
Also, any bakery you go to sells muffins.

911
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:25,085
Who would buy them off the streets?

912
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:26,985
You have no competitive edge.

913
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:29,465
Also, these signs are so hectic.

914
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:32,514
"Mix-in Muffin"... the names are so bad.

915
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:34,487
Why did you name them this way?

916
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:36,217
I told you...

917
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:43,601
Oh, Yoon Ah.
Are you... are you crying?

918
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:47,313
I'm already upset
that no one is buying them.

919
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:51,731
I'm so sad now with you
saying these things to me.

920
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,661
Well, still now.

921
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:57,521
Why would a grown adult cry?

922
00:44:57,521 --> 00:44:58,699
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,643
Gosh, now.

924
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:10,068
People are staring. Stop crying.

925
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:13,159
Gosh.

926
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:16,795
I'll just... I'll sell them for you.

927
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:19,349
I'll help you, okay?

928
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,190
- Really?
- Yes, so stop crying.

929
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,050
Okay? Stop.

930
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,487
I'll stop.

931
00:45:30,554 --> 00:45:32,380
I think this is the place.

932
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,460
Joon Ki, I don't think this is right.

933
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,340
Let's turn back now, huh?

934
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,373
You can go back.
You have no loyalty.

935
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:41,572
You really won't do.

936
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:43,411
The boss.

937
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:44,726
Be careful, be careful.

938
00:45:44,726 --> 00:45:46,686
- There's the boss.
- Wait.

939
00:45:46,686 --> 00:45:47,750
Geez.

940
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:51,637
Excuse me.

941
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:55,577
- Yes.
- Is this Kim Joon Sung's house?

942
00:45:55,577 --> 00:45:57,067
- Yes, why?
- Ah...

943
00:45:57,067 --> 00:46:00,318
We needed to speak to Kim Joon Sung.

944
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:02,610
Gosh, how annoying.

945
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,934
- Sir.
- Yes?

946
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:05,155
Someone's here to see you.

947
00:46:05,155 --> 00:46:06,762
- Me?
- Yes.

948
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,391
Who are you?

949
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,483
- Kim Joon Sung.
- Yes.

950
00:46:10,483 --> 00:46:12,505
Hello, I'm Lee Joon Ki.

951
00:46:12,505 --> 00:46:15,840
We have something we have to tell you.

952
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,592
Oh, really?

953
00:46:17,592 --> 00:46:19,818
- What...
- By any chance, long ago--

954
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,434
Honey!

955
00:46:21,434 --> 00:46:23,925
How long will the construction take?

956
00:46:23,925 --> 00:46:25,985
There's not much time.
It's a problem.

957
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:29,590
It'll be done before our wedding.
Don't worry.

958
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,465
Who are these people?

959
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:34,786
They said they had
something to speak to me about.

960
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:36,295
What is this about?

961
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:39,215
Ah, yes. It's just...

962
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:43,306
I came for part-time work.

963
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:44,817
- Part-time work?
- Part-time work?

964
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:47,585
I wasn't looking for part-time workers.

965
00:46:47,585 --> 00:46:50,132
Oh, President Choi sent you.

966
00:46:50,132 --> 00:46:53,255
I was yelling about the lack of
manpower yesterday.

967
00:46:53,255 --> 00:46:54,905
He finally sent people.

968
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:58,436
Yes, that's right.
President Choi sent us.

969
00:46:58,436 --> 00:47:01,246
You should've looked for me
if you came for part-time work.

970
00:47:01,246 --> 00:47:03,335
Why would you go looking for him?

971
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:04,485
Follow me.

972
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,815
Ah, yes.

973
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:10,097
Why would you suddenly
bring up part-time work?

974
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:12,338
How can I bring up Yoon Ah
when his fiancée is there?

975
00:47:12,338 --> 00:47:14,449
That's why I said we shouldn't come.
Let's just go.

976
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:16,677
That's a good idea. Let's go.

977
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:22,076
Where are you going?

978
00:47:26,465 --> 00:47:28,717
Actually, that's not what happened.

979
00:47:28,717 --> 00:47:30,045
We have a lot of work today.

980
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:33,235
What happened here is--

981
00:47:33,235 --> 00:47:35,271
So, the thing is--

982
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:37,898
I--

983
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,961
This punk.

984
00:47:39,961 --> 00:47:40,974
- Follow me.
- Doo Shik.

985
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:42,965
Mister, you have it wrong.

986
00:47:42,965 --> 00:47:44,775
Mister, Mister!

987
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,295
- Sorry, it's my first day.
- Sorry, it's my first day.

988
00:47:52,295 --> 00:47:54,445
What are we doing?
How long do we have to stay?

989
00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:56,940
What am I supposed to do?
He won't even listen to me.

990
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,483
Gosh.

991
00:47:58,483 --> 00:48:00,106
You want to go?

992
00:48:00,106 --> 00:48:02,300
- It won't work.
- Never mind.

993
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,885
Just go.

994
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:08,797
Get up.

995
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:13,059
Why isn't this drying?

996
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:14,898
What if I'm late for the interview?

997
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:17,041
<i>Excuse me.
Is anybody here?</i>

998
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:18,367
What now?

999
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:21,516
Is no one home?
I'm going crazy here.

1000
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:27,340
What do you want?

1001
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,807
I'm sorry, can I get an extra towel?

1002
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:31,690
I'm so darn busy.

1003
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,989
Where did everyone go anyway?

1004
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:38,092
Oh no! I'm running late.

1005
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:40,179
Hey, I'm busy right now.

1006
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:42,378
Towels are over there.
Go find it yourself.

1007
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,422
All righty.

1008
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,927
Also, look after the guest house
while I'm gone, okay?

1009
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:48,505
- Say what?
- Do you understand?

1010
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,253
Yeah. I got it.

1011
00:48:57,364 --> 00:48:59,675
Buy some bread.

1012
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:01,864
It's very good.

1013
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:04,974
What are you doing?
You have to be louder.

1014
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:06,443
I am trying.

1015
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,067
Buy some bread.

1016
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:11,166
It's good... it's good.

1017
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:13,387
They are handmade muffins.

1018
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:15,487
Yoon Ah, let's stop and go home.

1019
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:16,885
I don't think anyone's buying.

1020
00:49:16,885 --> 00:49:19,965
No, I have to throw these all out
if I can't sell them.

1021
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:22,925
You sure are stubborn.

1022
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:27,635
Why do you choose to
live such a difficult life?

1023
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:29,097
What do you mean by that?

1024
00:49:29,097 --> 00:49:30,817
I mean with Sol.

1025
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:34,085
Haven't you ever thought of
telling Sol's father?

1026
00:49:34,085 --> 00:49:37,067
No, I've never considered that.

1027
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:39,610
Isn't it hard to raise her alone?

1028
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:42,286
Of course, it is.

1029
00:49:42,286 --> 00:49:45,764
But I don't want to hold him back
using Sol as the excuse.

1030
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:50,626
Sol is my daughter
who has nothing to do with him.

1031
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:55,282
So, I'm going to raise her
the best I can on my own.

1032
00:49:55,797 --> 00:49:58,847
That's why I started selling bread too.

1033
00:50:01,038 --> 00:50:03,036
Do you want to go back if you're tired?

1034
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:05,184
I'm going to stay a little longer.
Go on home.

1035
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:08,675
No, forget that.
I spent the day here anyway.

1036
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:10,592
What's the point now?

1037
00:50:11,523 --> 00:50:13,704
Buy some bread. Buy some bread.

1038
00:50:13,704 --> 00:50:15,222
It's very good.

1039
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:17,663
Buy some bread. It's delicious.

1040
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:21,364
Please buy some bread.

1041
00:50:21,364 --> 00:50:22,641
Buy some bread.

1042
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:25,027
I've tried it.
It's good. Why won't you buy it?

1043
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:27,217
It's very good. Buy some bread.

1044
00:50:27,217 --> 00:50:29,237
What are you doing here?

1045
00:50:29,237 --> 00:50:32,041
What? We're selling bread.

1046
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:33,630
You have a permit, right?

1047
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,306
Of course, Dong Gu permitted it.

1048
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:39,954
I permitted it. What's the problem?

1049
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:43,097
<i>[Daeyoung Daily: Closed for interviews]
Don't we have unique interviews?</i>

1050
00:50:43,097 --> 00:50:44,806
Don't be nervous.

1051
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:47,228
We can have a meal and drink together.

1052
00:50:47,228 --> 00:50:49,606
We can relax and talk.

1053
00:50:49,606 --> 00:50:52,376
Take your jackets off and relax.

1054
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:53,471
Okay.

1055
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,494
<i>What happened? My blouse?</i>

1056
00:51:01,494 --> 00:51:03,608
<i>Where did my blouse go?</i>

1057
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:10,668
<i>I must be crazy.
What should I do?</i>

1058
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,094
What are you doing, Kang Seo Jin?

1059
00:51:12,094 --> 00:51:13,675
Take your jacket off and relax.

1060
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:16,784
No, thank you. I'm a little cold.

1061
00:51:16,784 --> 00:51:18,208
Oh, really?

1062
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,599
Do as you please, then.

1063
00:51:22,197 --> 00:51:23,898
The meat is here.

1064
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:32,507
I'm so sorry.

1065
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:35,045
Give that to me.
I'll launder it for you.

1066
00:51:35,045 --> 00:51:37,188
No, I'll do it.

1067
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:39,324
No, I'll do it. Give it to me.

1068
00:51:39,324 --> 00:51:42,746
I said... I'll do it.

1069
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:46,865
I'm okay, so please just go, okay?

1070
00:51:49,663 --> 00:51:51,543
Hey,  hey.

1071
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:53,567
Come on over.

1072
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:56,206
Good job today and get home safe.

1073
00:51:56,206 --> 00:51:58,778
- Come back tomorrow.
- Okay.

1074
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,612
Oh, hey. How much is this?

1075
00:52:07,268 --> 00:52:10,260
He may look that way,
but he pays well.

1076
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,793
Are you happy?
You must be glad to be paid well.

1077
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:15,945
Hurry up. I'm so tired.

1078
00:52:15,945 --> 00:52:18,777
- Don't do that.
- Okay, okay.

1079
00:52:18,777 --> 00:52:21,628
Hey, I think the fiancée went home.

1080
00:52:21,628 --> 00:52:24,202
- Should we tell him about Yoon Ah?
- Are you insane?

1081
00:52:24,202 --> 00:52:26,913
That Kim Joon Sung guy
is getting married soon.

1082
00:52:26,913 --> 00:52:29,882
What would happen if he knew
that Yoon Ah had his baby?

1083
00:52:29,882 --> 00:52:32,478
- Then his marriage would be called off!
- Right...

1084
00:52:32,478 --> 00:52:34,396
- What did you say?
- Huh?

1085
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:39,846
Yoon Ah... had my baby?

1086
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:41,331
Is that true?

1087
00:52:47,454 --> 00:52:49,903
Do you have boyfriends?

1088
00:52:49,903 --> 00:52:50,958
What?

1089
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,503
No, I don't.

1090
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,342
I don't have one yet either.

1091
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:56,963
Really?

1092
00:52:56,963 --> 00:53:01,157
Yoon Soo Mi, you look like you'd be
popular with men, so that's unexpected.

1093
00:53:01,157 --> 00:53:05,478
Men like glamorous types
like you, Yoon Soo Mi.

1094
00:53:05,478 --> 00:53:06,603
Pardon me?

1095
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:09,882
Why are you surprised?

1096
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:14,291
Ah, is this sexual harassment.
So sorry. I'm just kidding.

1097
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,757
These days, women are so scary.

1098
00:53:16,757 --> 00:53:18,989
You can't say anything. Goodness.

1099
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:24,476
I'll be in the bathroom for a moment.

1100
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:29,041
What kind of person is that, seriously?

1101
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,983
I would just like to...

1102
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,648
No.

1103
00:53:35,206 --> 00:53:37,184
Hold yourself back, Seo Jin.

1104
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:40,650
You have to get a job this time.

1105
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:57,197
<i>Yoon Soo Mi, should we go to a nice place
and have a drink after the interview?</i>

1106
00:53:57,197 --> 00:54:00,094
<i>Ah, I have plans though.</i>

1107
00:54:00,094 --> 00:54:01,233
<i>What plans?</i>

1108
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:03,454
<i>Are they more important
than passing this interview?</i>

1109
00:54:03,454 --> 00:54:06,684
<i>I guess you don't care about
failing this interview stage.</i>

1110
00:54:06,684 --> 00:54:07,847
<i>Well...</i>

1111
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:09,791
<i>Let's just have one drink.</i>

1112
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:12,172
<i>It doesn't mean anything.
You're just like my little sister.</i>

1113
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:15,619
Yoon Soo Mi,
don't you want to get hired?

1114
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:21,336
She said she doesn't want to.

1115
00:54:21,336 --> 00:54:24,172
What did you just say?

1116
00:54:24,172 --> 00:54:25,822
You say she's like your little sister?

1117
00:54:25,822 --> 00:54:30,590
If you want to drink so badly,
go with your real little sister.

1118
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,239
What?

1119
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:34,199
Hey, are you crazy?

1120
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:37,057
Let go... while I'm still using words.

1121
00:54:37,057 --> 00:54:39,775
What? What will you do then?

1122
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:42,063
What? Are you going to hit me?

1123
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:43,905
Then hit me.

1124
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,762
Here, here. Hit me once.

1125
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:48,760
What? You can't do it?

1126
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,539
Hey, bluff when
the situation is suitable.

1127
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:53,949
How dare a girl like you act up to me--

1128
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:05,556
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

1129
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:06,755
Report me if you want.

1130
00:55:06,755 --> 00:55:09,798
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

1131
00:55:11,257 --> 00:55:13,460
Let's go.
We don't need interviews like this.

1132
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,375
- Let me go.
- What?

1133
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:16,932
What's wrong with you?

1134
00:55:16,932 --> 00:55:20,105
Are you going to be
held responsible if I fail too?

1135
00:55:20,105 --> 00:55:24,009
Why would you do something useless
and damage my chance?

1136
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:27,686
Oh, I'm sorry.

1137
00:55:27,686 --> 00:55:30,070
Are you injured at all?

1138
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:32,896
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

1139
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,057
I'll do it for you.

1140
00:55:35,057 --> 00:55:36,369
Oh no.

1141
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:43,880
Joon Ki.

1142
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:47,690
Do you think we did something
we shouldn't have?

1143
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,668
What do you mean by "we"?

1144
00:55:50,668 --> 00:55:54,903
Hey, you're the one who told him.

1145
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:57,818
What? You're a petty bastard.

1146
00:55:57,818 --> 00:55:59,463
Are you putting the blame all on me?

1147
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:01,298
What did I do? What?

1148
00:56:01,298 --> 00:56:05,172
You told him with your mouth.
It was you, you, you.

1149
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:06,650
You must be crazy.

1150
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,768
You're trash... trash!

1151
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:10,324
Trash? Did you call me trash?

1152
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:12,541
I call trash what it is.
What else would I call you?

1153
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:15,396
Again? You fight every chance you get.

1154
00:56:15,396 --> 00:56:16,882
What's with you two?

1155
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:19,525
Wash your face. Wash up.

1156
00:56:19,525 --> 00:56:21,807
You're here?
Why are you coming in together?

1157
00:56:21,807 --> 00:56:23,688
We met out front.

1158
00:56:23,688 --> 00:56:26,686
Yoon Ah, how did sales go?

1159
00:56:26,686 --> 00:56:28,777
- Well, actually...
- We were selling bread.

1160
00:56:28,777 --> 00:56:31,157
We got all the bread
seized by the regulators.

1161
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:32,530
"Illegal street stall."

1162
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,128
She even got fined
for selling food products.

1163
00:56:35,128 --> 00:56:36,186
Really?

1164
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:39,971
It was my fault for not looking into it.

1165
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:41,398
- You're hungry, right?
- Yes.

1166
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,224
Sol's asleep, so I'll put her in bed
and get dinner started.

1167
00:56:45,224 --> 00:56:46,282
All right.

1168
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:51,686
- How can you call me trash?
- How can you put it all on me?

1169
00:56:51,686 --> 00:56:54,217
- You wanted to go.
- But, you told him.

1170
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:55,367
<i>Anyone here?</i>

1171
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:57,125
Yes, come on in.

1172
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,233
That voice.

1173
00:57:07,246 --> 00:57:09,612
I'm here to see Han Yoon Ah.

1174
00:57:10,164 --> 00:57:12,353
Oh, Yoon Ah?

1175
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:14,596
Who are you?

1176
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:16,945
Joon Sung?

1177
00:57:17,605 --> 00:57:18,836
Yoon Ah.

1178
00:57:21,695 --> 00:57:23,108
How did you know to come here?

1179
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:24,952
We need to talk.

1180
00:57:24,952 --> 00:57:27,456
- Oh no.
- What's going on?

1181
00:57:27,456 --> 00:57:29,751
- Who is that?
- Oh, that.

1182
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,427
Sol's dad.

1183
00:57:32,427 --> 00:57:35,206
What? Sol's dad?

1184
00:57:35,206 --> 00:57:36,815
How did he know to come here?

1185
00:57:36,815 --> 00:57:39,670
The thing is... we went looking for him.

1186
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:41,954
- To tell him about Sol.
- What?

1187
00:57:41,954 --> 00:57:43,980
Why would you do that?
Are you two crazy?

1188
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,014
Are you crazy?
I didn't do a thing and he told him.

1189
00:57:47,014 --> 00:57:48,603
What are you going to do now?

1190
00:57:48,603 --> 00:57:50,585
Are you really going to
betray me, you trash?

1191
00:57:50,585 --> 00:57:51,746
Trash?

1192
00:57:51,746 --> 00:57:53,226
I told you not to make that sound.

1193
00:57:53,226 --> 00:57:55,003
That's not important right now.

1194
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:57,175
Hurry, hurry. Let's follow her.

1195
00:57:57,175 --> 00:57:59,507
Why are we following?
It's their own family issue.

1196
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:01,695
- Why are we going?
- Just go.

1197
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,440
What's going on? Why are you here?

1198
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,842
Han Yoon Ah,
are you trying to ruin my life?

1199
00:58:11,842 --> 00:58:13,889
What? What do you mean?

1200
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:16,762
Listen carefully.
I'm getting married soon.

1201
00:58:16,762 --> 00:58:19,900
So, here. Take this.

1202
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,940
Take this and
don't contact me again, got it?

1203
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,614
What is that?

1204
00:58:24,614 --> 00:58:26,293
What is this?

1205
00:58:26,293 --> 00:58:29,284
Is it not enough?
You wanted to use a baby to get money.

1206
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:30,356
It's not enough?

1207
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:32,567
You should be thankful to get this.

1208
00:58:32,567 --> 00:58:36,347
Honestly, how would I even know
who that baby's dad is?

1209
00:58:36,954 --> 00:58:39,134
What is that jerk saying?

1210
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,565
Hey, Dong Gu. Dong Gu!

1211
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:43,666
You could be playing me for money.
Isn't that right?

1212
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:47,076
You suddenly show up and
I don't know what you're talking about--

1213
00:58:47,076 --> 00:58:48,931
- Oh!
- Ouch!

1214
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:52,425
You jerk.
How can you even say that?

1215
00:58:52,425 --> 00:58:55,405
Do you even know how she's been living?

1216
00:58:55,405 --> 00:58:58,045
- That guy and his anger.
- Get money from you?

1217
00:58:58,045 --> 00:59:00,396
- Dong Gu, what are you doing?
- Let go.

1218
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:02,597
A guy like this has
no right to be Sol's dad.

1219
00:59:02,597 --> 00:59:04,835
- A guy like this should just--
- Wait!

1220
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:09,309
Sol's dad? What are you talking about?

1221
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:11,391
He's not Sol's dad.

1222
00:59:14,414 --> 00:59:17,001
What? He's not Sol's dad?

1223
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,311
Then, who is he?

1224
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:22,054
Just a guy I was set up with long ago.

1225
00:59:22,054 --> 00:59:25,074
Then why was his phone number
saved in your phone?

1226
00:59:25,074 --> 00:59:26,284
I wanted to know not to answer it.

1227
00:59:26,284 --> 00:59:29,052
He would always drink,
call, and come looking for me.

1228
00:59:29,052 --> 00:59:31,000
Then why are you here?

1229
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,434
The day we met,
I drank and blacked out.

1230
00:59:34,434 --> 00:59:37,329
I wondered if
something happened that day.

1231
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:40,606
Oh... how embarrassing.

1232
00:59:40,606 --> 00:59:44,335
I'm the crazy person
for believing these two.

1233
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:45,766
Seriously.

1234
00:59:45,766 --> 00:59:46,909
Hey.

1235
00:59:47,724 --> 00:59:50,153
Where do you think you're going
after punching me?

1236
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,208
What?

1237
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:55,492
You know what?

1238
00:59:56,074 --> 00:59:58,965
I had an interview today.

1239
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:01,907
I don't I passed though.

1240
01:00:01,907 --> 01:00:03,547
I...

1241
01:00:04,753 --> 01:00:08,485
used a pork rib to slap
the interviewer across the face.

1242
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:10,414
Just like this.

1243
01:00:13,324 --> 01:00:17,920
He was a really bad person.

1244
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,581
But you know what?

1245
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:23,418
I was told that I was wrong.

1246
01:00:24,492 --> 01:00:29,327
That I made a mistake.

1247
01:00:30,983 --> 01:00:33,311
I really thought...

1248
01:00:33,311 --> 01:00:37,146
that I did the right thing.

1249
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:41,528
I don't know.

1250
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,731
I just don't.

1251
01:00:45,382 --> 01:00:48,588
I really don't know.

1252
01:00:55,795 --> 01:00:58,161
I only talked about my problems.

1253
01:00:58,161 --> 01:01:01,233
You look like you have problems too.

1254
01:01:01,233 --> 01:01:05,346
Tell me. I'll listen to them.

1255
01:01:11,873 --> 01:01:13,980
By the way, Mister...

1256
01:01:15,856 --> 01:01:17,891
are you not wearing pants?

1257
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:19,101
Mister?

1258
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:22,106
You have to wear pants
when you go to an interview.

1259
01:01:22,106 --> 01:01:24,503
You're in trouble if you don't.

1260
01:01:24,503 --> 01:01:28,253
Stop looking forward and look at me.

1261
01:01:28,253 --> 01:01:33,001
Look at my blouse... my blouse.

1262
01:01:42,945 --> 01:01:44,753
Ow, my eye.

1263
01:01:44,753 --> 01:01:46,793
He has a good punch.

1264
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:50,443
How embarrassing.

1265
01:01:50,443 --> 01:01:55,690
Gosh, I was crazy.
Those guys are so unhelpful to my life.

1266
01:01:58,371 --> 01:02:00,311
Geez.

1267
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:01,702
Here.

1268
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,762
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Yes.

1269
01:02:15,762 --> 01:02:18,056
So, why did you do that?

1270
01:02:18,692 --> 01:02:21,416
He was talking in such a rude manner.

1271
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,099
Oh my.

1272
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:24,974
So, you were thinking of my feelings?

1273
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,048
Thinking... thinking of you, no.

1274
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:29,340
It's not like that.

1275
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,233
Never mind, then.

1276
01:02:32,521 --> 01:02:34,521
Whatever the case,
thank you, Dong Gu.

1277
01:02:34,521 --> 01:02:36,090
What for?

1278
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,387
For letting me stay here.

1279
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,458
I was very lonely before coming here.

1280
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:48,695
I don't really think
those thoughts anymore.

1281
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,271
I have people who worry about me now.

1282
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,221
I never had a family,
so I don't really know very well.

1283
01:02:57,221 --> 01:03:01,864
I think to myself,
this must be what family is like.

1284
01:03:01,864 --> 01:03:05,505
Then just do your work properly.

1285
01:03:05,505 --> 01:03:07,887
There's your lecturing again.

1286
01:03:09,012 --> 01:03:12,246
Hey, your bruise won't go away
if you do it like that.

1287
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,922
- Give it to me. I'll help.
- Forget it.

1288
01:03:14,922 --> 01:03:16,827
Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

1289
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:18,027
I said forget it.

1290
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:19,460
Just trust me.

1291
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,512
- Gosh, I said no.
- Oh!

1292
01:03:23,097 --> 01:03:24,557
What do we do?

1293
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:28,284
Seriously, I said I got it!

1294
01:03:28,284 --> 01:03:30,722
What kind of woman
can't do anything right?

1295
01:03:30,722 --> 01:03:34,117
Well... I didn't do it purpose!

1296
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:37,362
Look at you.
You're yelling back now.

1297
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:38,833
My gosh.

1298
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,751
I was a little nice to you.
This won't do.

1299
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,893
It was partially your fault too, Dong Gu.

1300
01:03:43,893 --> 01:03:45,251
You always just pick on me.

1301
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:46,961
You think I don't have a temper?

1302
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:49,362
Oh, how scary.
What did I do wrong?

1303
01:03:49,362 --> 01:03:51,632
Let's see that temper of yours.
What will you do?

1304
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:53,434
- What will you do? Huh?
- Oh?

1305
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:55,641
Oh! I'll get really mad.

1306
01:03:55,641 --> 01:03:58,032
- Get mad, then.
- I was holding myself back.

1307
01:03:58,032 --> 01:04:01,362
What will you do if you don't hold back?
You've seen me mad, right?

1308
01:04:01,362 --> 01:04:03,086
You'll be truly shocked.

1309
01:04:03,086 --> 01:04:05,659
You're the one who
will be shocked, Yoon Ah.

1310
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:07,686
Why are you so strong?

1311
01:04:07,686 --> 01:04:10,262
Why is your head like a rock, Yoon Ah?

1312
01:04:10,262 --> 01:04:11,896
I'm really going to get mad!

1313
