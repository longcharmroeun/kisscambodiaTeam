1
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:34,575
When did it start?

2
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:38,070
Does that mean you've been lying to me all along?

3
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,845
We weren't lying on purpose.

4
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:42,670
We just couldn't tell you the truth since we knew you'd be angry.

5
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,140
If you had known, you shouldn't have started in the first place.

6
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:48,585
Dong Gu, we really like each other.

7
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:51,395
- It's true. So... - Be quiet!

8
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:57,165
I won't accept it. That's final.

9
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,135
Why not?

10
00:00:59,663 --> 00:01:00,835
What's your reason?

11
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:04,260
There are some things that can't be. Just stop here.

12
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:05,435
No.

13
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:07,575
Who are you to stop us?

14
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:09,405
I'm an adult now.

15
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:11,940
I'm not a young girl who needs your approval to date someone.

16
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,945
She's right, Dong Gu. I won't give her up.

17
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,755
So you two still want to date?

18
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:19,885
All right.

19
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:23,085
Seo Jin, you're not my sister from now on.

20
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:27,050
And Jun Ki, you don't exist to me.

21
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:28,265
Do you understand?

22
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,850
Why do you need to be so harsh on them?

23
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,935
- They like each other. - Are you on their side?

24
00:01:32,362 --> 00:01:33,760
Then you don't mean anything to me too.

25
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:35,730
Why are you being so childish?

26
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:37,205
I'm childish. So what?

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,405
So whose side are you on? Are you on their side?

28
00:01:39,502 --> 00:01:41,545
Yoon Ah, are you on their side too?

29
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,845
What? I...

30
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,745
You must be since you can't answer me right away.

31
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,610
All right. None of you exist to me from now on.

32
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:51,610
Don't talk to me or even act like you know me.

33
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:52,785
Do you understand?

34
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:09,935
(Their Wretched Love)

35
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:22,615
It's been so long since I watched this movie.

36
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:26,010
That scene is so romantic.

37
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:29,655
It is. When will I get to fall in such a romantic love?

38
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:34,225
What are you cleaning?

39
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:37,235
It's the shoes that Mal Geum sent me.

40
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,835
You're so in love.

41
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:42,005
- Do you like them that much? - Yes.

42
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,805
I like them so much that I can't even wear them.

43
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:46,105
Gosh.

44
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:51,645
Soon, you'll start breathing moths.

45
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:54,545
When did you two start going out together?

46
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,555
It's been a while.

47
00:02:58,214 --> 00:02:59,540
I'm sorry we haven't been able to tell you guys.

48
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:02,355
It's okay. We all know what Dong Gu is like.

49
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:05,350
I would have kept it from him too. I understand you.

50
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:08,195
Thank you, Du Shik. You're the best.

51
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:15,865
Hi, Trash of Mullae-dong.

52
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:18,375
I said I can't play today.

53
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:20,805
Count me out today.

54
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:23,875
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:26,815
Trash of Mullae-dong?

56
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:29,015
He's a member of my gaming guild.

57
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:31,140
We're supposed to play together today.

58
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:34,050
He's been begging me to join all day.

59
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,610
What? They can't play without you?

60
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,220
Are you that important?

61
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,550
Hey, you have no idea.

62
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:43,860
Jun Ki might be a nobody in real life,

63
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,960
but in the gaming world, he is the king.

64
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:48,465
People are willing to pay a fortune for his character.

65
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:50,800
Really? Why don't you sell it then?

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,360
What are you talking about?

67
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,400
I wouldn't sell my character for a million dollars.

68
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:55,830
- What? - When I die,

69
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:58,970
people will have to put it in a USB stick and bury it with me.

70
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,510
- Of course. - My goodness.

71
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,715
I don't understand you.

72
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,610
Yoon Ah, how is Dong Gu?

73
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:08,110
He doesn't want to eat.

74
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,295
His blanket is pulled over his head, and he won't come out.

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,520
He's being ridiculous again.

76
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,025
I can't believe him.

77
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,895
Where are you going? What are you going to do?

78
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:24,100
Dong Gu, I need to talk to you.

79
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,175
Oh, my blanket just moved by itself.

80
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,305
Is it a ghost?

81
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:33,175
Are you serious?

82
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,715
Oh my. It moved again.

83
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,385
I can't believe it.

84
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:42,910
Are you really going to do this?

85
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,650
I have an idea too.

86
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:46,855
What are you going to do?

87
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:49,025
Listen.

88
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:51,560
Until you approve of...

89
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,890
our relationship,

90
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:56,065
I won't shave, okay?

91
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:57,675
What?

92
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:05,475
You don't like it, do you? It's driving you crazy, right?

93
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,715
Fine. Let's see who wins.

94
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,855
Hey, Seo Jin.

95
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:14,225
Hey.

96
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:19,855
How dare she threaten me, saying she won't shave?

97
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:21,925
Seo Jin.

98
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,135
What is this all about? Why would you stop shaving?

99
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:28,005
An eye for an eye.

100
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:30,460
I'll protest against Dong Gu.

101
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:34,100
I'm all for that, but why would you stop shaving?

102
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:36,900
Dong Gu hates it when I don't shave.

103
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:38,970
It is the strongest, visual weapon...

104
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,085
I have against him.

105
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,310
But you have to go to work.

106
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:45,615
I can take a vacation.

107
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:48,955
I'll make him give in.

108
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,295
You can count on me.

109
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:53,725
Seo Jin.

110
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,090
Why would she take a vacation to grow a mustache?

111
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:59,165
Why?

112
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:01,530
Am I the only one who thinks it's weird?

113
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:05,300
She's Seo Jin. Dong Gu's sister.

114
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,505
They're the same blood.

115
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:09,530
Why don't you just break up with her?

116
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,675
Be quiet!

117
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,275
Why?

118
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,445
How can they be so weird?

119
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:20,115
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

120
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:24,155
Philip? His name is Philip?

121
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:27,795
He's an expensive model.

122
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:30,820
Do we really need him?

123
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,390
Hey. He is...

124
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:35,565
known as Park Bo Gum of the shopping mall model world.

125
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:38,605
Everything he puts on gets sold out.

126
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:39,900
Park Bo Gum?

127
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,375
He can't be that handsome.

128
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,215
Philip, we're over here.

129
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,285
I'm sorry I'm late.

130
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,285
I've been shooting from early morning. I apologize.

131
00:06:57,053 --> 00:07:00,425
It's okay. We shouldn't have come so early.

132
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,250
Hi.

133
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:05,935
I'm the CEO of Soorgio Armhany, Min Soo Ah.

134
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:10,575
Try this coffee. It smells wonderful.

135
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,235
All right.

136
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,300
But I have bad rhinitis.

137
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,115
I can't smell well.

138
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:19,940
I see.

139
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,715
Rhinitis, you bad boy!

140
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,615
You're very funny.

141
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,755
By the way... Well...

142
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:32,325
You have chili powder stuck in your teeth.

143
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,695
What?

144
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:45,435
Look.

145
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,905
Did you have to say that to my face?

146
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,045
Did you really have to embarrass me like that?

147
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,545
- Well... - What?

148
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:57,310
- I just... - Cut it out.

149
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,385
I...

150
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,185
can't shoot today because I feel too offended.

151
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:02,885
Wait.

152
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:07,025
I'm sorry we offended you. My boss is a bit insensitive.

153
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:09,265
Apologize to him right now.

154
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:13,835
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:17,430
Please stop being angry. It'll never happen again.

156
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,675
I'll...

157
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:21,205
let it slide...

158
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,505
for Director Bong's sake.

159
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,215
Thank you.

160
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,280
Come on in. This is our guesthouse.

161
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:37,655
We'll shoot here.

162
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,195
I see.

163
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:42,265
It's very cute. I like the interior design.

164
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:43,595
I'm glad to hear that.

165
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,535
- Please go upstairs. - Okay.

166
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,530
What's this smell? Did you fart?

167
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,875
Hold on. Is something rotting here?

168
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,585
I don't know. Where is it coming from?

169
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,255
What?

170
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:14,795
I think it's coming from there.

171
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:21,065
Hold on. Aren't they Philip's shoes?

172
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:23,800
Are you saying this stink comes from his feet?

173
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,935
I think so.

174
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,700
He looks fine.

175
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,830
I can't believe his feet stink so badly.

176
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:32,145
Does he even know how bad his feet smell?

177
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,815
He said he can't smell well because of his rhinitis.

178
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,915
Rhinitis can't explain this. Does he have no nose at all?

179
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,910
Du Shik, do we really need to shoot with him?

180
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,050
Of course.

181
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:47,265
We're supposed to upload pictures of our new products today.

182
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:50,420
Anyway, pretend everything is okay in front of him, okay?

183
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,660
The smell is just too bad.

184
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,830
- I can't stand it. - Didn't you see?

185
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,830
He got so upset when you pointed out the chili powder in his teeth.

186
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,860
If you complain about his smelly feet, there will be no shooting.

187
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:01,105
Just put up with it, okay?

188
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:02,645
Okay.

189
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,275
2, 3.

190
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:15,125
Why would she grow a mustache?

191
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,755
Why is she so stubborn?

192
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:23,265
Are we having cheonggukjang for lunch?

193
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,235
I can't wait.

194
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:29,360
Dong Gu, are we having cheonggukjang for lunch?

195
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:30,505
I don't...

196
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:35,675
Dong Gu, can we talk?

197
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:39,915
Dong Gu. Gosh, that...

198
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:43,185
Wait. It's not cheonggukjang.

199
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:45,315
What is this smell?

200
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:54,465
Did you think you could talk to me that casually?

201
00:10:56,092 --> 00:11:00,265
I won't talk to you until you two break up.

202
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,935
I'll prove...

203
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:09,705
my determination.

204
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,185
There's no toilet paper.

205
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:19,155
Jun Ki...

206
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:24,655
Right. I'm not talking to him.

207
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:27,490
That was a mistake.

208
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,565
I almost talked to him.

209
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,035
What should I do?

210
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:37,035
I have no socks or towels here.

211
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:41,545
Dong Gu, can we...

212
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,700
Where did your t-shirt go?

213
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:44,975
You were wearing one a moment ago.

214
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:47,645
What?

215
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,815
Dong Gu. Hey.

216
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:53,855
That's strange.

217
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:56,525
I'm sure he was wearing one.

218
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:01,495
Gosh, it smells so bad. Hey.

219
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:03,225
The whole house stinks now.

220
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:06,565
Stop it. What if he notices?

221
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:10,105
Here he comes. Smile.

222
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:14,675
I'm sorry you had to wait for so long.

223
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,475
Should we start?

224
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,445
Where should I be standing?

225
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:21,510
Well... Let me see.

226
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,345
Maybe over there.

227
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:25,415
- Over there? - Yes.

228
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:29,925
Let me see...

229
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,555
What about this?

230
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:36,995
Yes. That looks good.

231
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:39,620
Your jeans are not rolled up.

232
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,030
Are they supposed to be rolled up? How high?

233
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:43,405
Let us help you.

234
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,705
What are you doing? Go help him.

235
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:49,075
- Me? - Of course. You're the stylist.

236
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:51,275
Do we have to roll them up?

237
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:52,600
Can't you just shoot?

238
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,270
Those jeans need to be rolled up.

239
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:56,085
Go help him. We don't have time.

240
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,755
Fine.

241
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:03,685
- Thank you. - She'll help you.

242
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:08,295
Roll it up a little more. Do it on the other side.

243
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:17,575
Thank you.

244
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,635
That's good.

245
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,245
That pose looks good.

246
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,745
That's good.

247
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,500
Don't move the feet.

248
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,240
I should move them to look active.

249
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:29,640
No, your feet are fine.

250
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:30,980
The rolled-up part is the key-point, right?

251
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,240
Don't move.

252
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:33,880
That looks great.

253
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:36,225
The foot isn't in the frame. Don't move it.

254
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:46,365
What are they doing upstairs? Why does it smell?

255
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:48,965
Blocking my nostrils doesn't help.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,205
Sol, can you believe that Jun Ki and Seo Jin are dating?

257
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:58,575
This isn't right, is it?

258
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:00,715
What do you think?

259
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:02,915
You don't agree, right?

260
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:06,540
That's why I'm so angry.

261
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:10,325
I'm furious. Those punks.

262
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,425
What?

263
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:16,325
My goodness.

264
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:17,535
Wait.

265
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:19,265
Gosh.

266
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:23,235
Goodness, these balls...

267
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:24,535
I should go out.

268
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,275
What? What's going on?

269
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:31,115
- Goodness. - What's this smell?

270
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,845
What kind of smell is this?

271
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:38,355
Hey, what are you doing?

272
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:40,485
Are you stuck?

273
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,125
Do you need help?

274
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:48,865
You're so stubborn.

275
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,835
Then stay like this.

276
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:53,095
You startled me.

277
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:56,905
Seo... Seo Jin.

278
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,505
Dong Gu.

279
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:02,005
You still won't accept it?

280
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,375
Is that so?

281
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,715
You won't accept it, will you?

282
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:10,885
Fine, let's see who wins.

283
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:12,885
Let's go until the end.

284
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:17,225
Seo Jin, Seo Jin.

285
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,125
What's wrong with her?

286
00:15:19,455 --> 00:15:22,995
Dong Gu, until when will you stay like this?

287
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:25,535
Are you that against the idea that we're dating?

288
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:28,635
Fine, do whatever you want.

289
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:31,935
I'll treat you like a stranger, okay?

290
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:33,975
Darn it.

291
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:36,375
Do whatever you want.

292
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,515
That won't make me accept it.

293
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:42,140
Why can't I get out?

294
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:45,915
Goodness, I have to go to the office.

295
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:54,925
This is embarrassing.

296
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:00,235
Hello, Director.

297
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,105
I'll be there after the meeting with the actors.

298
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:11,075
How can I meet the actors while looking like this?

299
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:19,755
Excuse me, sir.

300
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:21,425
What? Goodness.

301
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,355
Who... Who are you?

302
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,795
I know that we just met,

303
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:30,025
but could you cut this for me?

304
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:34,765
The screenplay was written with you in mind.

305
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:36,565
Is that so?

306
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,705
Then I have to accept the offer, director.

307
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,645
- Oh no. - It's okay.

308
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:50,685
Director, we have no choice but to cast Seo Jin Woo.

309
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:52,810
Including Gong Yoo, Hyun Bin, and Won Bin,

310
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,250
no actors will take it.

311
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,525
What are you talking about?

312
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,980
His acting isn't good.

313
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:01,590
He isn't very handsome. I heard he has a bad personality.

314
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,790
- Stop it. - What do you mean, no?

315
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:07,435
I heard that he's bossy when he isn't a star.

316
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,035
Goodness.

317
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,675
Mr. Seo Jin Woo.

318
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:15,275
Jin Woo, listen.

319
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:17,815
It's okay.

320
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:21,415
The bossy actor who isn't a star will leave now.

321
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:24,240
- Good luck. - Wait, Jin Woo.

322
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:26,440
- It's just a rumor. - Jin Woo, wait.

323
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:28,255
- It's only a rumor. - Let me explain.

324
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:31,525
Are you out of your mind?

325
00:17:31,987 --> 00:17:34,195
- I'm sorry. I didn't know. - Be quiet.

326
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,350
- Bring Jin Woo back here. - Pardon?

327
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:38,020
Don't think about coming back without him.

328
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:41,205
Why don't you just quit? Just quit.

329
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:42,935
That looks good.

330
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:44,335
Great.

331
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,205
That's good. One more.

332
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,870
That's great. Shall we take a break?

333
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:51,115
Already? Okay.

334
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:54,385
- I'll take a break. - Enjoy.

335
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:56,345
Take a break downstairs.

336
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:02,510
Du Shik, I can't do it anymore. I'll suffocate.

337
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:05,120
You're not the only one. My nose is getting sore.

338
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,165
- Just endure it. - I can't take it anymore.

339
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:10,125
Shall we open the windows?

340
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,595
What if he finds out about it?

341
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:15,035
Just don't do anything.

342
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:18,835
Shall we make him wash his feet?

343
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:20,305
Wash his feet?

344
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:22,175
How?

345
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,970
I brought you a drink.

346
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,585
Thank you.

347
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:34,925
- My goodness. - Gosh, I'm sorry.

348
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:37,610
Oh, no.

349
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,920
Your socks are wet. It must feel sticky.

350
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:42,895
You should wash your feet.

351
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:46,195
I don't have much time until my next appointment.

352
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,865
Let's continue the shoot. Let's go.

353
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,065
Gosh, but still...

354
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,875
Your feet will be sticky.

355
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:55,745
It won't be comfortable.

356
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:56,945
Is that so?

357
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,775
All right.

358
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,345
I'll take off my socks.

359
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:11,355
We don't have much left.

360
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,655
Let's work hard until the end.

361
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:16,325
Let's put our energy together.

362
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:19,095
Yes, we can do it.

363
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:21,765
We can do it. We can...

364
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:24,005
Let's go.

365
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,605
Why did you do such an unnecessary thing?

366
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:32,875
- The smell is worse. - I didn't know this would happen.

367
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,445
I'm about to lose my...

368
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:39,940
Why was Seo Jin Woo there?

369
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:42,080
I can't believe it.

370
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,485
Why was he even there?

371
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:51,765
Listen.

372
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:56,435
- Jun Ki? - Let's play just one round.

373
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:58,205
I can't.

374
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:00,160
I have to go home. I have a shoot tomorrow.

375
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:04,305
As the leader, if you treat us like this, I'll be disappointed.

376
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:06,315
Excuse me.

377
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,485
Dong Gu.

378
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:10,045
Why are you here?

379
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,615
What? Do you know him?

380
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,015
Pardon?

381
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:17,125
I knew him before,

382
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:18,555
but I don't anymore.

383
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:20,625
What do you mean?

384
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:24,395
Anyway, I have nothing to say to you.

385
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,390
Don't even try, and leave.

386
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:29,390
Could I please talk to you?

387
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:31,160
10... How about 1 minute?

388
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,405
- I said no. - One minute.

389
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:34,930
- Let's go. - Okay.

390
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:36,400
Mr. Seo Jin Woo.

391
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:38,915
Let's go in, Jun Ki.

392
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,315
Mr. Seo Jin Woo.

393
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,285
Can you read the screenplay just once?

394
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:45,685
Mr. Seo Jin Woo.

395
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,985
Goodness.

396
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:53,495
How does Jun Ki know him?

397
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,690
I didn't know you were here.

398
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:01,290
Hello, Hyun Joon.

399
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,830
Did you have fun at the orientation?

400
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:04,975
Yes.

401
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:08,230
By the way, why did you leave early?

402
00:21:08,237 --> 00:21:10,105
There was a reason.

403
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,040
I'll get going now.

404
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,185
- Are you leaving already? - Yes.

405
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:18,010
Dong Gu hasn't eaten anything since then.

406
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:20,815
I should go and make something that he likes.

407
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,655
Are you that worried?

408
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:26,425
- Dong Gu isn't a child. - He's like one.

409
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:31,220
Yoon Ah, may I ask you something?

410
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:32,595
Yes, what is it?

411
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,335
You said that...

412
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,665
you didn't want to believe anyone anymore.

413
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,435
That you didn't want to get hurt again.

414
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:42,270
- Yes. - What if...

415
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:44,075
there's someone you can trust?

416
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:47,245
What if there's someone who will never hurt you?

417
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:48,685
What will you do then?

418
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:50,845
That'd be great,

419
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,315
but will that person appear?

420
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:55,125
Why do you ask?

421
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,225
It's nothing.

422
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,555
I'll get going.

423
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,745
I can still smell it.

424
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:22,210
His feet are like chemical weapons.

425
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,710
Keep it down. What if he hears you?

426
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,685
I can't stand it anymore.

427
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:29,450
Du Shik, let's just wrap it up now.

428
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:30,655
Wrap it up?

429
00:22:30,953 --> 00:22:33,255
Soo Ah, how could you say that?

430
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,320
What did I say that was so wrong?

431
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:38,095
You wanted to do it properly this time.

432
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,760
You said it's your last hope.

433
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:43,460
But his feet smell unbearable.

434
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:44,635
Min Soo Ah!

435
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:47,075
Is this the best you can be?

436
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:50,270
There will be a lot of hardships when we do business.

437
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:53,140
If you don't think you'll be able to suffer smelly feet,

438
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:54,545
just give it up already.

439
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:58,155
Min Soo Ah, I'm so disappointed in you.

440
00:22:58,413 --> 00:22:59,615
I really am.

441
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:02,355
Du Shik, I'm sorry.

442
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,655
I wasn't thinking.

443
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,665
- Don't get so angry. - No. You should stay here.

444
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:10,325
I'll finish the rest.

445
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:27,245
Sorry I was late.

446
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,640
What are you doing?

447
00:23:28,644 --> 00:23:30,140
I saw this ball over there.

448
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:33,110
I was a basketball player for a while when I was little.

449
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:34,510
Really?

450
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:35,885
I was a shooter,

451
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,455
and I never missed.

452
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:42,820
Keeping the form is important when you shoot.

453
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:44,995
- Do you want to see? - Sure.

454
00:23:58,573 --> 00:23:59,640
Did you see that?

455
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:01,470
Do you want to see it one more time?

456
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:03,645
Wait... Wait.

457
00:24:04,212 --> 00:24:05,355
By the way,

458
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:08,725
where did you get those shoes?

459
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:10,655
These?

460
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,695
I found them there and tried them on.

461
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:13,955
But these...

462
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,620
are really soft.

463
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,795
Sargent jump.

464
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:24,165
Why is your expression like that?

465
00:24:35,444 --> 00:24:37,645
You crazy dirt bag!

466
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:41,650
How dare you wear them with your rotten feet?

467
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,355
You smelly monster!

468
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:47,655
What's wrong? What do you mean, smelly monster?

469
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:51,795
- Me? - Then would it be me, you lunatic?

470
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:53,495
You brazen scum!

471
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:54,560
Hey!

472
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:56,790
Do you know how smelly your feet are?

473
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:59,430
Your feet are rotten!

474
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:01,500
The smell is worse than the sewer.

475
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:03,930
It's worse than stinky tofu!

476
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:06,740
How dare you wear the precious shoes...

477
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:09,270
that my first love gave me?

478
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:10,470
I'm going to chop that wretched feet off!

479
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,040
Take them off, you scum!

480
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:14,715
I'm going to poke your eyes, you scumbag.

481
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:16,885
Gosh,

482
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,925
you're killing me.

483
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:20,880
You haven't met Seo Jin yet?

484
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:22,450
What have you been doing?

485
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,195
I can solve this...

486
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:26,695
Director? Director?

487
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,735
Gosh, he's driving me crazy.

488
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:33,000
All right.

489
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:35,345
I will go in and continue. Bye.

490
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,170
Gosh.

491
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:40,245
Doesn't he have any plans?

492
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:43,115
Should I ask Jun Ki?

493
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:45,255
But I have been ignoring him.

494
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:46,855
What should I do?

495
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:55,625
What is it? Do you want to talk to me?

496
00:25:58,393 --> 00:25:59,565
What are you doing?

497
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:07,075
Let me meet Seo Jin Woo.

498
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,505
What's this?

499
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:11,370
You said you won't talk to me.

500
00:26:11,373 --> 00:26:13,775
You told me I didn't exist to you.

501
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,855
I only mentioned talking, not messaging.

502
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:20,715
Are you going to help me or not?

503
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:26,625
You're so stubborn.

504
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:33,495
All right. I will.

505
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:35,090
But in turn,

506
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,535
you need to acknowledge the fact...

507
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:38,435
that Seo Jin and I are dating.

508
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:49,385
What's wrong? Gosh.

509
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:54,080
Forget it. I'll curse you until the day I die.

510
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:56,485
Gosh, he must be crazy.

511
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,325
Hey! What are we going to do now?

512
00:27:00,622 --> 00:27:02,120
Philip was hurt,

513
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:04,050
and he's never going to work with us again.

514
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,165
I'm sorry.

515
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:08,065
But he was wearing the shoes that Mal Geum had given to me...

516
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:09,565
without any socks on.

517
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:11,935
- He even jumped. - Be quiet.

518
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,500
You got angry at me for complaining,

519
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,600
and yet, you complained and cursed at him directly.

520
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:19,170
What? "It's worse than stinky tofu"?

521
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:21,275
"The smell is worse than the sewer"?

522
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,240
- I'm sorry. - Forget it.

523
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:24,515
Gosh.

524
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:27,455
We need to upload the pictures of the new products by today.

525
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:30,010
Where will we get a model at this late hour?

526
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,750
Du Shik can do it instead.

527
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:33,025
- What? - What?

528
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:34,655
Du Shik?

529
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,090
We don't want to ruin the shopping mall.

530
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:41,265
Why do you say that? He's handsome in my eyes.

531
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:43,305
Yoon Ah.

532
00:27:43,465 --> 00:27:45,635
You have poor taste in men.

533
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:49,145
This can't do.

534
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:52,045
But you need to upload them by today.

535
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:54,615
Gosh, I can't believe this.

536
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:02,055
I still can't get the smell out.

537
00:28:02,317 --> 00:28:04,085
Should I pour some bleach?

538
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:09,425
- Soo Ah. - Yes?

539
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:22,605
What do you think? I tried my best.

540
00:28:26,107 --> 00:28:28,585
Shall we begin? Where should I stand?

541
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:31,215
That way, sir.

542
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,955
What? Why are you addressing me that way?

543
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:38,755
It's nothing. Go on.

544
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:40,095
Okay.

545
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:48,135
Should I stand still like this?

546
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:51,105
- Sure. I'll begin. - Okay.

547
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:03,115
- Director, I'm here. - Hey.

548
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,785
Why is Seo Jin Woo here?

549
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:10,885
He decided to be on our film just now.

550
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:13,180
What? Really?

551
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:15,450
Thank you. Thank you so much.

552
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:17,865
You should thank Jun Ki.

553
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:20,460
He followed me around all day and asked me to read this.

554
00:29:20,462 --> 00:29:21,965
That's the only reason why.

555
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,405
- Jun Ki? - I think...

556
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:26,600
you must be important to him.

557
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:29,630
He even offered me the game character...

558
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,000
that he had refused so many times.

559
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:34,975
Thanks to him, I became the leader of the guild.

560
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,395
Hi.

561
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,070
I heard...

562
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:09,045
that you asked Seo Jin Woo to help me out.

563
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,485
Why did you do that?

564
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,985
I'm still not going to acknowledge you two.

565
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:18,655
That's not why I did that.

566
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:22,265
I was only trying to help because you were having trouble.

567
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:24,225
It's fine.

568
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,290
Gosh, it's so bothersome.

569
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:31,465
We need to talk.

570
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:33,405
Why?

571
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:36,545
- I thought we weren't talking. - Stop being so picky.

572
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:38,075
Jun Ki,

573
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:41,345
do you really want to date Seo Jin?

574
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:49,725
Dong Gu, I'm really sorry,

575
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:52,395
but I can't give up on her...

576
00:30:53,555 --> 00:30:55,325
even if that means you'll never see me again.

577
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,520
Do you really need to do that?

578
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,435
My feelings for her are sincere.

579
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:00,865
I truly mean it.

580
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,805
Are you really not satisfied with me?

581
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,975
- It's not that. - What is it then?

582
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:12,570
My sister and my best friend are dating.

583
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:15,170
Why would I not like that?

584
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:16,585
But what if...

585
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:18,345
you two break up?

586
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:20,415
What would I do?

587
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:24,385
I won't be able to see you again.

588
00:31:25,954 --> 00:31:26,950
You know that, right?

589
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:28,995
- Is that the reason? - Of course.

590
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,890
How can we know the future? Aren't you worried?

591
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:33,595
Don't worry.

592
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,965
I will never break up with her.

593
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:38,700
I won't ever make her cry either.

594
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,335
If anything, I'd be the one to cry.

595
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:43,605
So just have trust in me, you punk.

596
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:45,775
What did you just say?

597
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,175
What?

598
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:50,215
What? What's wrong?

599
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:52,415
How dare you call me a punk?

600
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:54,785
You should treat me as an elder.

601
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:57,855
What are you talking about?

602
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:00,855
Wait.

603
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:04,025
Does that mean...

604
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:06,195
you'll let us see each other?

605
00:32:07,662 --> 00:32:08,965
I was going to,

606
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:12,205
but you have no respect for me. Forget about it.

607
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:13,875
Sir.

608
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:17,505
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

609
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:19,445
What?

610
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:22,715
That's too much. Stop it.

611
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:26,455
- Your spit tastes great. - Hey.

612
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:29,885
Seo Jin! Seo Jin, wake up!

613
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:32,995
What's wrong?

614
00:32:34,022 --> 00:32:37,625
Hey, why does your beard grow so quickly?

615
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:40,320
Did it grow that much? It's great.

616
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:42,190
Wait here. I'll show it to my brother.

617
00:32:42,197 --> 00:32:43,335
Seo Jin.

618
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:45,635
You don't need to do this anymore.

619
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,105
- We got his approval. - What?

620
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:50,645
Really? He did?

621
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:53,775
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

622
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:55,985
Why is it so hard to date you?

623
00:32:56,377 --> 00:32:59,380
Can we go on dates as much as we want now?

624
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,350
Can I tell people you're my boyfriend?

625
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,885
Of course. You can even say it on a news program.

626
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,695
- I'm so happy. - Hey, it hurts.

627
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:10,790
I'm sorry.

628
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,135
This won't do. I'll go shave first.

629
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:15,935
- Seo Jin. - Yes?

630
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,475
There's something I've always wanted to do for you.

631
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:22,105
What is it?

632
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:49,365
I love you.

633
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,600
They've been in the room for a while now.

634
00:33:58,606 --> 00:33:59,840
What are they doing?

635
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,070
Let them be.

636
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:04,085
They seem so happy. You should've supported them from the beginning.

637
00:34:05,046 --> 00:34:06,215
I know.

638
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,615
I was worried at first.

639
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:12,555
But I could see in Jun Ki's eyes that I could trust him.

640
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,655
He'd never...

641
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,225
make my sister cry.

642
00:34:18,459 --> 00:34:19,990
I knew that.

643
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:21,560
You're good at nothing.

644
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,860
I said I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

645
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:24,930
Is that all?

646
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:27,130
Why did you have to insist on shaving my face?

647
00:34:27,135 --> 00:34:29,675
- What if it leaves a scar? - I didn't mean to hurt you.

648
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:32,170
Also, why is your facial hair so stiff?

649
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:33,745
They're like whale tendons.

650
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,315
What? Whale tendons?

651
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:36,670
Are you done, you jerk?

652
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:37,815
"Jerk"?

653
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,380
Did you just call me a jerk?

654
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,380
I can't believe how rude you are.

655
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:43,180
Yes, I'm rude.

656
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:45,080
Do you regret going out with a rude girl like me?

657
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:47,480
Yes, I do. What are you going to do?

658
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:49,850
I see. Then let's break up.

659
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:51,625
Fine. Let's break up.

660
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,895
Dong Gu. We're breaking up.

661
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,965
Oh, really?

662
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,305
Well...

663
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,145
Dong Gu, calm down. I was just joking.

664
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:09,640
- You were joking? - Yes.

665
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:12,080
- It was just a love quarrel. - She's right.

666
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,115
Love quarrel, my foot.

667
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:17,455
Come here. Both of you!

668
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:19,250
- Come here! - I'm scared!

669
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:20,855
Seo Jin, come here!

670
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:28,765
Hello. Yes.

671
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:33,475
Okay. Yes.

672
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:37,645
I'll get a scoop by all means. Yes, sir.

673
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,045
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

674
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:43,910
What's wrong?

675
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,415
It's work.

676
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,915
My boss will fire me if I don't get a scoop.

677
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:49,325
I don't know what to do.

678
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:54,325
Have you heard anything at the broadcasting station?

679
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:55,565
Anything like dating rumors.

680
00:35:56,758 --> 00:36:01,535
It's not exactly a dating rumor, but I've heard something.

681
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,065
What is it?

682
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:10,570
- You know Han Min Ju, right? - Yes.

683
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:13,670
She and Park Jin Cheol, the chairman of Songjin Group,

684
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,145
are rumored to have a child together.

685
00:36:15,176 --> 00:36:17,815
- They had an affair? - Be quiet.

686
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,340
That old man and Han Min Ju?

687
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:22,625
Yes.

688
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,855
It's from a 100 percent reliable source.

689
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:26,225
Who told you this?

690
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:28,155
You've been to the broadcasting station, right?

691
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:30,650
There is a secret hallway only for VIPs.

692
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:32,620
Only top stars like Gong Yoo and Won Bin...

693
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:34,790
or senior executives can access it.

694
00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:37,430
Did you hear it from a senior executive?

695
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:39,075
No. I heard it from a security guard.

696
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,205
We usually grab coffee together. Isn't it amazing?

697
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:42,875
"A security guard"?

698
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,475
Are you kidding me?

699
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:46,175
You don't seem to understand.

700
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:49,410
High-quality information tends to come from those sources.

701
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,585
Is that right?

702
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:53,285
Then where can I meet him?

703
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:58,650
You two are here together.

704
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:00,680
Dong Gu, what brings you here?

705
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:02,995
I need to ask Hyun Joon a favor.

706
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,090
A favor?

707
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:06,595
You made some large-sized bread for me the other day, right?

708
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:08,390
I need about 30 more of those.

709
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:10,490
- A bit bigger this time. - Sure.

710
00:37:10,498 --> 00:37:11,865
Are you two going somewhere together?

711
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,305
Yes. Something great happened to Yoon Ah today.

712
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:16,630
We're going to have a drink together.

713
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:17,805
A drink?

714
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:20,775
A place wants to sell my muffins.

715
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,185
Really?

716
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:25,740
I'd love to celebrate together.

717
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:28,615
Shared joy is a double joy, right?

718
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,825
- Am I wrong? - But not today.

719
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:33,655
I have something to tell Yoon Ah.

720
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:36,165
Can't you say it if I'm there?

721
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,195
Is it something I shouldn't hear?

722
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:44,965
(A Simple Confession 2)

723
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:46,505
Congratulations, Yoon Ah.

724
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,605
Thank you.

725
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,270
Isn't this place too expensive?

726
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:55,640
It's a happy day. We need great food.

727
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:57,810
Don't worry. Please just enjoy.

728
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:59,315
Okay. Thank you.

729
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:05,025
Please excuse me.

730
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:08,580
Dong Gu, let me fill your glass.

731
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:10,195
No. I'm fine.

732
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:12,025
I'll order something else for myself.

733
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:15,090
That wine is really not for me.

734
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:16,365
Also,

735
00:38:16,397 --> 00:38:18,900
I don't want to drink anything you pay for.

736
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,600
All right. Suit yourself.

737
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:23,645
Excuse me. I'd like to see the menu, please.

738
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,345
Let me see.

739
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:29,345
Do they have my favorite wine?

740
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,040
Wait.

741
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:35,355
The cheapest wine costs 12 dollars a glass?

742
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:46,965
- Are you ready to order? - What?

743
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,835
- I'll have a glass of this. - Okay.

744
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:57,145
By the way, could you take away 20 cents' worth of wine?

745
00:38:57,605 --> 00:39:00,870
- Sorry? - I have a lot to do tonight.

746
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:04,440
I'm afraid I won't be able to finish everything if I drink a whole glass.

747
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:07,415
Please take away about 20 cents' worth of wine.

748
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:21,890
- It tastes so good. - Right.

749
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:25,065
You said you had something to tell me.

750
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,405
Yes.

751
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:29,775
I'll tell you some other time.

752
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:32,105
It's getting late. Should we go home now?

753
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:33,445
Sure.

754
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:46,750
You should never leave any food.

755
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:48,995
When you die, you have to eat all the food you've ever left.

756
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,165
How much do I need to pay?

757
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,590
I've paid for everything.

758
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:53,765
You can just go.

759
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:56,605
Thank you so much for the dinner.

760
00:39:56,664 --> 00:39:59,335
Hold on. Can we talk?

761
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:02,100
Then I'll get some fresh air outside.

762
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:03,275
Okay.

763
00:40:04,372 --> 00:40:06,315
Look. Didn't I tell you...

764
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:08,775
I'd never owe you anything?

765
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,015
It's for my wine. 11 dollars and 80 cents.

766
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:19,825
Please wait a moment.

767
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:23,550
Thank you so much for the dinner.

768
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:24,725
Bye.

769
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:27,065
Okay. See you in class.

770
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:29,635
Bye, Dong Gu.

771
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:31,035
Hold on.

772
00:40:31,432 --> 00:40:33,105
Wait here a second.

773
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:34,330
Why?

774
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:37,130
Just wait here.

775
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:39,615
- Yoon Ah, let's go in. - Okay.

776
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,610
- Here. - What is this?

777
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:52,210
It's for the taxi.

778
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,520
I'm paying for myself...

779
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:55,890
and Yoon Ah. Check if it's the right amount.

780
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,125
Don't complain later.

781
00:40:57,258 --> 00:40:59,065
Is this really necessary?

782
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,190
Didn't I tell you...

783
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:03,505
I'd never owe you anything?

784
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:08,475
Gosh, it's 10 cents up now.

785
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:11,005
Here. 10 cents.

786
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:14,540
- Give me three cents. - What?

787
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,385
Forget it. You can keep it.

788
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:21,410
Also, you seem to keep...

789
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:23,825
taking my employee out.

790
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:26,425
Please stop.

791
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:28,555
It's interfering with my business.

792
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:31,250
You're the one who interfered today.

793
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:32,495
What?

794
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,320
What do you mean by that?

795
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:37,105
Never mind. I'll get going.

796
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,815
What was he talking about?

797
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,375
I really don't like him.

798
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,455
Well...

799
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:02,120
You're Mr. Kim Yong Shik, right?

800
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:04,695
Yes. Who are you?

801
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,035
I'm...

802
00:42:06,894 --> 00:42:09,360
reporter Kang Seo Jin from Joyoung Daily.

803
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,165
What's the matter?

804
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:15,975
You said Han Min Ju and Park Jin Cheol have a child together.

805
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:17,505
Is that right?

806
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:19,645
Who says so?

807
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:21,570
I've never said that.

808
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:24,840
I heard it from Lee Jun Ki, who is appearing in "Newsroom".

809
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,580
Gosh.

810
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,115
I asked him not to tell anyone. This is so much trouble.

811
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,225
I'll never reveal your identity. Please tell me the details.

812
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:33,755
Did you witness it?

813
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:37,795
No, I didn't witness it myself.

814
00:42:37,992 --> 00:42:40,360
I heard it from someone totally reliable.

815
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:42,195
Who is that person?

816
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,290
You know Elegance Salon in Cheongdam-dong, right?

817
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:47,775
- Yes. - Han Min Ju goes there.

818
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:50,070
There's a director there. Her name is Won Kyung Hee.

819
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,230
Won Kyung Hee.

820
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:52,970
Then you heard the news from that director?

821
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:56,215
No. She has a favorite hair designer at the shop.

822
00:42:56,477 --> 00:42:58,340
The designer's name is Lee Jung Min.

823
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,380
Then you heard it from Designer Lee Jung Min.

824
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:01,485
No.

825
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:04,085
There's an assistant that works for Designer Lee Jung Min.

826
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:06,595
She's in charge of hair washing. Her name's Kim In Hae.

827
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,450
I can't believe my brother-in-law.

828
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:11,095
I told him not to tell anyone.

829
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,220
I promise I'll protect you,

830
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:15,420
so don't worry. Please tell me the details.

831
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,565
Then...

832
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:18,730
you can't write that I told you this no matter what.

833
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:20,135
Don't you worry.

834
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:23,570
Did you see it in person?

835
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:25,475
I didn't see it myself,

836
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,445
but I heard it from someone that's 100 percent reliable.

837
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:29,945
Oh, I see.

838
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:31,615
You know Han Min Ju's agency,

839
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:33,185
YS Entertainment, right?

840
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:37,450
Then you heard it from an employee of YS Entertainment?

841
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,980
No. In the agency's cafeteria,

842
00:43:39,987 --> 00:43:42,080
there's a chef by the name of Lee Choon Bok.

843
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,920
Then you heard it from Chef Lee Choon Bok.

844
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:48,195
No. He loves jjamppong, so he orders in every day...

845
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:49,990
from a place called Yung Ho Gak.

846
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:51,730
Their jjamppong soup is amazing.

847
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,105
- Excuse me. - Yes.

848
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:54,935
Please get back to the point.

849
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:56,930
Anyway, among the delivery guys,

850
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:58,845
there's a guy named Uhm Ji Yong.

851
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:03,070
People call him "Uhm G Dragon"

852
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,970
I heard it directly from him.

853
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,455
Where's Yung Ho Gak?

854
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:14,155
I'm glad my muffins are selling well.

855
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:21,565
I'm sure it was somewhere around here. Where was it exactly?

856
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:36,043
(Uhm G Dragon)

857
00:44:37,578 --> 00:44:40,681
I told her not to tell anyone.

858
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,951
She sure is a blabbermouth.

859
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:45,853
I promise I'll protect you,

860
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:47,554
so don't worry. Please tell me what you know.

861
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:48,956
Did you see it in person?

862
00:44:49,156 --> 00:44:51,292
I didn't see it in person,

863
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:53,727
but I heard it from someone that's 100 percent reliable.

864
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:54,862
Pardon?

865
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:57,598
You know the famous designer Andy Kim, right?

866
00:44:57,598 --> 00:44:59,066
Of course I do.

867
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,035
Did you hear it from Mr. Andy Kim?

868
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:02,102
No.

869
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,105
In Designer Andy Kim's fashion show,

870
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:08,309
there's a top model that appears regularly. Her name's Han Hye Jin.

871
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:10,844
Then you heard it from that model Han Hye Jin?

872
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:11,912
No.

873
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:14,348
You should hear me out.

874
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:16,216
I apologize.

875
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,185
These days, Han Hye Jin...

876
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:21,655
gives lectures at a model academy.

877
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:25,659
I heard it from a student that audited her lectures.

878
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:28,495
She's a fan of G Dragon.

879
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:30,397
She's a member of the fan club in the Gangseo Area.

880
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:31,699
I'm the club president.

881
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:34,068
How could she dare lie to the president?

882
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:36,236
Where can I find that person?

883
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:39,406
I heard she was recently planning to go abroad,

884
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,875
but she was swindled by her boyfriend.

885
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:45,245
I heard she's living off her ex-boyfriend these days.

886
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:46,313
Pardon?

887
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:51,685
By any chance, can I get her name?

888
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:54,922
I can't believe this. It was you...

889
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:57,658
that said Han Min Ju gave birth to the child of Song Jin's chairman?

890
00:45:57,658 --> 00:45:58,792
What?

891
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:01,462
I never said such a thing. Who told you that?

892
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:04,164
The delivery guy at the delicious restaurant, Yung Ho Gak,

893
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:05,766
who is well known as "Uhm G Dragon."

894
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,534
I heard everything from Mr. Uhm Ji Yong.

895
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:11,038
Gosh. I can't believe our president.

896
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:13,574
We've held all those fan meetings together. We're basically comrades.

897
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:15,042
How could he just betray me like this?

898
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:18,545
Come on. Be honest and tell me the details.

899
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:20,848
The fact that Han Min Ju gave birth to Song Jin's chairman's child...

900
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:22,216
Did you see it in person?

901
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,585
I didn't see it in person,

902
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:27,521
but I heard it from someone that's 100 percent reliable.

903
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,323
Then you heard it from someone else too?

904
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:32,126
How come no one's actually seen it? Everyone's just heard it.

905
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:33,327
Is this even true?

906
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,462
It's 100 percent true.

907
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,631
I heard it directly from a nurse that works at the hospital...

908
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,967
that Han Min Ju's baby was delivered in.

909
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,403
She delivered the baby herself.

910
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:43,704
Really?

911
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:46,240
She delivered Han Min Ju's baby herself?

912
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,408
That's what I just said.

913
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:49,810
This is amazing. This is a scoop.

914
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,545
Soo Ah. Thank you so much.

915
00:46:52,046 --> 00:46:54,181
My leg. My leg is killing me.

916
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:57,284
You should drive safely. Look what you've done.

917
00:46:57,284 --> 00:46:59,086
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

918
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,056
Doctor. Is he extremely injured?

919
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:03,724
He leg is broken severely.

920
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:05,559
- Excuse me? - It's a compound fracture.

921
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:08,595
He must go into surgery, and there will be aftereffects.

922
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:09,763
What did you just say?

923
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:11,331
This is driving me crazy.

924
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:12,933
Miss. What are you going to do about this?

925
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,368
How are you going to take care of this?

926
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:16,003
I have to go to work tomorrow.

927
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:17,538
I'm truly sorry.

928
00:47:17,538 --> 00:47:19,173
I promise you I'll take care of everything.

929
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:20,808
I'm truly sorry.

930
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:31,351
It's going in. It fits in.

931
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:36,290
Perfect. It went in.

932
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:39,126
Gosh. It actually works.

933
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:41,228
This is amazing.

934
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:43,764
Yoon Ah. Welcome home.

935
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,703
What's that look on your face? Is something wrong?

936
00:47:50,504 --> 00:47:51,605
What?

937
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,774
No, it's nothing.

938
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:56,944
I'm a bit tired. I'm going to go and get some rest.

939
00:47:58,679 --> 00:47:59,880
What's wrong with her?

940
00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:16,630
Are you Nurse Yoon Ji Woo?

941
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,232
Yes. And who might you be?

942
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:22,236
I called you earlier. I'm Kang Seo Jin from Joyoung Daily.

943
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:23,504
You know Min Soo Ah, right?

944
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:27,875
You must be talking about that girl I met while shopping at Dongdaemun.

945
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,910
- Pardon? - She seemed like a fun girl.

946
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,080
We got closer over some soju and pork back-bone stew.

947
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,181
Why do you ask?

948
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:37,217
From what I heard, she said...

949
00:48:37,885 --> 00:48:41,155
you told her that you delivered Han Min Ju's baby.

950
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:43,757
- Is that true? - Excuse me?

951
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:47,094
Yes, I did.

952
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:49,496
Gosh. This is a major scoop.

953
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:53,033
I delivered Han Min Ju's baby...

954
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:54,902
in my dream.

955
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,304
- Your dream? - Yes.

956
00:48:57,304 --> 00:49:00,340
There's a mother that looks like Han Min Ju in our hospital.

957
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,144
The mother's beautiful, but her husband looks so old.

958
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:06,713
He looks like he's in his 60s.

959
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:09,483
Surprisingly, that came out in my dream.

960
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,322
I'm going to kill Soo Ah.

961
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,158
I see. So it was a dream?

962
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:20,494
I was a bit drunk that day.

963
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:22,062
I must have heard wrong.

964
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:23,463
I'm sorry.

965
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:26,400
You're sorry? Is that all you've got to say?

966
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,402
Do you know how much trouble I went through today?

967
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,604
A person can make a mistake when they're drunk.

968
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:32,172
You call that a mistake?

969
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:34,241
All because of you,

970
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:36,843
There's a rumor spreading that Han Min Ju had an affair...

971
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,645
with an old man and gave birth to his child.

972
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:40,714
- Really? - Yes?

973
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:43,784
I didn't know I was such an influential person.

974
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:44,985
I wasn't aware.

975
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:48,055
So are you happy? Are you proud?

976
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:49,756
No.

977
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:52,492
So this is how rumors spread.

978
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:55,128
I never imagined a person that spreads rumors like that...

979
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:56,964
would be someone this close to me.

980
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:00,634
How on earth am I supposed to face my editor.

981
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,569
You take the blame. It's all your fault.

982
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:04,404
What are you going to do about this?

983
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:10,410
Then do you want me to give you a huge scoop?

984
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:13,280
This is a fact 100 percent.

985
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:16,216
A huge scoop?

986
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:18,585
What is it?

987
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:21,922
Come close.

988
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:33,567
What? Kang Dong Won is an alien?

989
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,235
That's what I'm telling you.

990
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:38,205
Kang Dong Won's looks are unreal.

991
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:40,707
If he cocks up his ears and uses telepathy,

992
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:42,109
a spaceship comes down to earth.

993
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:43,277
Stop that nonsense.

994
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,113
Gosh. You drive me crazy.

995
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:48,382
Wait. Then I'll give you something else.

996
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:50,584
Park Bo Gum has wings on his back.

997
00:50:50,584 --> 00:50:52,152
He's an angel. He's an angel.

998
00:50:55,689 --> 00:50:57,090
I need some water.

999
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,330
This is Yoon Ah's cell phone. She must've left it behind.

1000
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:08,035
Hello? This is Yoon Ah's cell phone.

1001
00:51:08,635 --> 00:51:11,471
I see. Yoon Ah apparently left her cell phone at home.

1002
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:12,806
May I ask whose calling?

1003
00:51:15,008 --> 00:51:17,778
Excuse me? What was that?

1004
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:23,984
Did you say 30,000 dollars?

1005
00:51:23,984 --> 00:51:27,054
You should know that I'm helping her out...

1006
00:51:27,054 --> 00:51:29,623
by not going to the police and coming to an agreement.

1007
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,858
I can't work with my arm and leg like this.

1008
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:33,794
You don't know how much damage this is causing me.

1009
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:35,762
But 30,000 dollars is too much.

1010
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:37,998
How do you expect her to come up with that kind of money?

1011
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:39,866
If she won't agree, we can just go to the police.

1012
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:40,834
I'll go ahead and press charges.

1013
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:42,803
No. I'll give it to you.

1014
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:47,274
I'll find a way to come up with the money.

1015
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:49,576
Please give me some time.

1016
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:56,116
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah.

1017
00:51:58,218 --> 00:51:59,853
Yoon Ah. We need to talk.

1018
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,189
Dong Gu. What is it?

1019
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:04,358
I heard you had a car accident.

1020
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,627
You should have told me about it.

1021
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:11,098
I'm sorry. I didn't want to worry you.

1022
00:52:11,098 --> 00:52:13,133
What is it? What happened?

1023
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,175
What? 30,000 dollars?

1024
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,411
I'm sorry.

1025
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:26,813
I couldn't tell you.

1026
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:29,716
It's okay. Let's talk about that later.

1027
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,451
Can everyone get some money?

1028
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:32,886
I'll also ask around.

1029
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:34,521
- Okay. - You can count on me.

1030
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:35,822
I will.

1031
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,324
We can do it.

1032
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:39,793
Don't worry so much.

1033
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,662
We'll find a solution, okay?

1034
00:52:51,571 --> 00:52:53,407
Hello, Sung Yong.

1035
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:55,675
It's been a long time.

1036
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:57,411
May I borrow some money?

1037
00:52:57,611 --> 00:52:59,513
You're getting married?

1038
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,648
Hey Hyung Eun, it's Dong Gu.

1039
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:03,450
Dong Woo, how are you?

1040
00:53:03,817 --> 00:53:05,385
May I borrow some money?

1041
00:53:06,086 --> 00:53:08,021
Director, could you help me out?

1042
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:09,923
I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

1043
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:11,591
I don't have spare money.

1044
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:31,044
Hello.

1045
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:36,583
I can't take out more loans than I already have.

1046
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:39,653
Did you get any money?

1047
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:43,123
Is that so?

1048
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:46,493
Okay.

1049
00:54:09,616 --> 00:54:11,618
What brings you here?

1050
00:54:12,185 --> 00:54:13,620
It's because...

1051
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:16,990
I have a favor to ask you.

1052
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:18,992
A favor?

1053
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:20,760
You're asking me a favor?

1054
00:54:20,994 --> 00:54:22,195
Hyun Joon.

1055
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:29,236
Could you lend me 30,000 dollars?

1056
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:30,871
30,000 dollars?

1057
00:54:32,506 --> 00:54:33,673
What's going on?

1058
00:54:36,076 --> 00:54:39,513
I need to know what it's for, so I can lend it to you.

1059
00:54:42,415 --> 00:54:45,352
If you don't tell me, I can't lend it to you.

1060
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,823
Yoon Ah got into an accident.

1061
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,226
Yoon Ah? What happened?

1062
00:54:53,627 --> 00:54:55,061
Did something happen to her?

1063
00:54:55,328 --> 00:54:58,064
Yoon Ah got into a car accident, and she needs settlement money.

1064
00:54:58,765 --> 00:55:00,467
I tried to find money, but...

1065
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:02,836
Let's go. I'll get the money now.

1066
00:55:07,874 --> 00:55:09,442
What are you doing? Come with me.

1067
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:16,683
I'm sorry.

1068
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:21,688
Sir, I don't have money right now.

1069
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,224
Can I pay you a little later?

1070
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:26,526
I'll definitely get it for you.

1071
00:55:26,526 --> 00:55:29,062
Forget it. Just call the police.

1072
00:55:29,095 --> 00:55:32,198
I have nothing to say to you. Just call the police.

1073
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:35,602
- Call the police. - Sir, listen.

1074
00:55:36,536 --> 00:55:38,004
Did they come already?

1075
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:39,673
The police advanced so much.

1076
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:42,642
- Are you Seo Tae Hoon? - That's me.

1077
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:44,578
You're under arrest for threat...

1078
00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:46,146
and insurance fraud.

1079
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:47,714
- Pardon me? - Arrest him.

1080
00:55:47,814 --> 00:55:50,350
Why? I'm a patient.

1081
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:56,723
You got lucky.

1082
00:55:56,756 --> 00:55:58,625
You almost got duped.

1083
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:02,395
He's one of the worst ones who stage car accidents.

1084
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,230
The doctor works with him,

1085
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,466
so they duped so many people.

1086
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:09,436
Thank you.

1087
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:13,173
I don't have to pay the settlement, right?

1088
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:15,141
Right, don't worry about it.

1089
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:16,743
Take them.

1090
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:19,412
Walk properly.

1091
00:56:22,749 --> 00:56:24,250
Thank you so much.

1092
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:27,053
Yoon Ah.

1093
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:29,956
Dong Gu. Hyun Joon.

1094
00:56:29,956 --> 00:56:32,025
I heard that you were in an accident. What happened?

1095
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:33,793
Well,

1096
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:35,762
it's been settled.

1097
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,864
I don't have to pay him anymore.

1098
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:40,533
He stages auto accidents.

1099
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:43,937
I was so worried. That jerk.

1100
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:45,672
Really?

1101
00:56:45,705 --> 00:56:47,807
That's a relief. I was very worried.

1102
00:56:48,174 --> 00:56:49,442
I'm sorry.

1103
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:52,245
You have to come to the police station.

1104
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:55,115
Me? Why?

1105
00:56:55,148 --> 00:56:57,017
We need to investigate witnesses.

1106
00:56:58,518 --> 00:57:00,620
Yoon Ah, don't worry so much.

1107
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:03,690
I'll call an attorney to go with you.

1108
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,058
Don't be so scared.

1109
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:06,893
Thank you, Hyun Joon.

1110
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:08,395
Thank you so much.

1111
00:57:16,336 --> 00:57:18,571
What happened? Has it been resolved?

1112
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:21,908
Yes, Hyun Joon introduced me to an attorney.

1113
00:57:21,908 --> 00:57:23,276
Everything got settled.

1114
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:26,446
I'm sorry for making you worried.

1115
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:29,582
It's okay. I'm glad to hear that it's been resolved.

1116
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:32,952
I'm tired.

1117
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,387
I'll get some rest.

1118
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,542
What are you doing?

1119
00:57:56,276 --> 00:57:57,444
Nothing.

1120
00:57:57,711 --> 00:57:59,846
Yoon Ah's problem was resolved, so what's wrong?

1121
00:57:59,979 --> 00:58:01,214
Did something happen?

1122
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:04,784
It's just... I feel pathetic.

1123
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:07,721
Pathetic? Why?

1124
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:11,991
I tried to get money for Yoon Ah but couldn't find any.

1125
00:58:13,526 --> 00:58:16,696
However, Hyun Joon could solve it within one second.

1126
00:58:18,131 --> 00:58:19,532
He also knows an attorney.

1127
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,369
That's because he's much older.

1128
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:25,772
He's also a famous pastry chef.

1129
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:27,440
Right?

1130
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:29,142
It's normal, right?

1131
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:32,712
Something so normal...

1132
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:36,516
doesn't feel normal at all.

1133
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:49,129
I'm glad that the problem got resolved.

1134
00:58:49,129 --> 00:58:51,731
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

1135
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:54,000
No, I didn't do anything.

1136
00:58:55,368 --> 00:58:57,670
What did you want to tell me?

1137
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:01,407
Let's eat first.

1138
00:59:01,975 --> 00:59:04,377
- Do you want more wine? - Okay.

1139
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:13,186
Goodness.

1140
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,422
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay.

1141
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,059
I'll go use the restroom.

1142
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:21,261
Okay.

1143
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:34,908
How was the food?

1144
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:37,243
Yes, it was delicious.

1145
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:40,880
What did you want to tell me?

1146
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:45,685
Yoon Ah, actually I...

1147
00:59:45,685 --> 00:59:46,886
Wait.

1148
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:49,122
Where did it go?

1149
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:53,026
Is something missing?

1150
00:59:53,026 --> 00:59:55,495
Yes, my hairpin is gone.

1151
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,730
I definitely had it a minute ago.

1152
00:59:58,331 --> 01:00:00,600
Where did it go? What should I do?

1153
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:03,303
Gosh, where did it go?

1154
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,606
Where did it go?

1155
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,075
You can buy another hairpin.

1156
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,044
I'll buy you a pretty one.

1157
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:14,614
No, Dong Gu bought it for me.

1158
01:00:15,014 --> 01:00:17,083
It's the first gift from Dong Gu.

1159
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:24,657
Did I lose it in the restroom?

1160
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:27,126
I'm going to the restroom.

1161
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:41,941
Yoon Ah, don't look so sad.

1162
01:00:43,176 --> 01:00:44,344
I'm sorry.

1163
01:00:44,711 --> 01:00:47,280
I ruined your mood.

1164
01:00:47,947 --> 01:00:49,582
No, it's okay.

1165
01:00:53,486 --> 01:00:55,755
- Wait. - What is it?

1166
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:03,263
Isn't this the hairpin that you lost?

1167
01:01:03,897 --> 01:01:06,532
Yes, this is it.

1168
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,002
I'm so relieved.

1169
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,338
You're finally smiling.

1170
01:01:12,338 --> 01:01:13,806
Are you happy that you found it?

1171
01:01:13,806 --> 01:01:16,409
Yes, I thought I lost it.

1172
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,711
I was very worried.

1173
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,848
Shall we go?

1174
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:23,917
Yoon Ah.

1175
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:26,619
I have something to tell you.

1176
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,121
That's right.

1177
01:01:28,655 --> 01:01:30,423
What is it? Tell me.

1178
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,292
This is what you said.

1179
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:34,761
You don't want to trust anyone.

1180
01:01:35,395 --> 01:01:36,863
You don't want to get hurt.

1181
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,666
Right, I did.

1182
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:43,002
I don't want you to be scared of love...

1183
01:01:43,236 --> 01:01:45,772
because you fear getting hurt.

1184
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,874
I don't want you to hesitate either.

1185
01:01:49,175 --> 01:01:51,077
- Pardon? - So...

1186
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:54,981
don't let go of the person that you like.

1187
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:57,550
What do you mean?

1188
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,085
I'm talking about Dong Gu.

1189
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:01,387
You...

1190
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:04,490
have feelings for Dong Gu.

1191
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:08,494
- Pardon? - But...

1192
01:02:08,628 --> 01:02:11,297
you're worried and afraid you might get hurt again. That's why...

1193
01:02:11,297 --> 01:02:12,732
your pushing him away.

1194
01:02:13,266 --> 01:02:14,334
Isn't that right?

1195
01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:18,705
But by pushing him away,

1196
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:20,840
what if you lose the person you have feelings for?

1197
01:02:21,441 --> 01:02:23,042
Won't you get hurt that way as well?

1198
01:02:24,444 --> 01:02:26,112
Don't you think that'll hurt more?

1199
01:02:30,316 --> 01:02:33,586
Shall we go separate ways from here today?

1200
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:37,490
All right. Drive safely.

1201
01:02:45,565 --> 01:02:47,066
Dong Gu refused...

1202
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:51,004
to even borrow 10 cents for his taxi fee.

1203
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:55,541
But he came to meet me when you got in that car accident.

1204
01:02:56,075 --> 01:02:57,543
He asked me to help you.

1205
01:02:58,344 --> 01:03:00,346
He would've chosen to die rather than asking for my help.

1206
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:04,150
I think that proves how much he likes you.

1207
01:03:05,685 --> 01:03:07,286
Could I be overanalyzing?

1208
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:11,891
I should really get going now.

1209
01:03:41,254 --> 01:03:43,656
I'll sell all of these for you.

1210
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:44,891
I'll help you, all right?

1211
01:03:44,891 --> 01:03:46,726
Please buy these muffins. Please buy these.

1212
01:03:46,726 --> 01:03:47,927
They're delicious.

1213
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,363
Do you even know how she's living these days?

1214
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:54,467
Get out of my way. Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah.

1215
01:03:55,268 --> 01:03:57,136
You're not hurt, are you?

1216
01:03:57,136 --> 01:03:58,771
You're okay, right?

1217
01:04:00,006 --> 01:04:03,743
Do you think a person that went to date girls came to eat sundae?

1218
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,311
I like you, Yoon Ah.

1219
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:06,913
I like you a lot.

1220
01:05:05,872 --> 01:05:07,607
What are you doing here all alone?

1221
01:05:08,574 --> 01:05:09,842
I was just sitting here.

1222
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:12,712
Are you coming back from somewhere?

1223
01:05:12,979 --> 01:05:14,747
I went out to meet Hyun Joon.

1224
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:18,184
I see.

1225
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,157
Hyun Joon seems like a better guy than I had thought.

1226
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:27,193
He's competent and has a good personality.

1227
01:05:27,193 --> 01:05:29,328
Also, he's pretty good-looking...

1228
01:05:30,997 --> 01:05:32,665
and he treats you well.

1229
01:05:32,965 --> 01:05:34,133
Wait a minute.

1230
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:37,170
Why are you saying that to me?

1231
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:39,372
I'm just saying.

1232
01:05:39,372 --> 01:05:41,574
Dong Gu. Do you know you're a real fool?

1233
01:05:42,408 --> 01:05:44,577
You sure are oblivious.

1234
01:05:44,677 --> 01:05:46,078
What do you mean?

1235
01:05:46,078 --> 01:05:47,246
Never mind.

1236
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:50,383
I'm tired. I'm going downstairs and get some rest.

1237
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,189
Why is she getting mad at me?

1238
01:05:59,592 --> 01:06:00,826
What is this?

1239
01:06:02,962 --> 01:06:05,431
- You like him that much? - Yes.

1240
01:06:05,431 --> 01:06:07,934
Then say, "I like you."

1241
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,937
Dong Gu. I like you.

1242
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,506
- Try to be sweet. - I like you.

1243
01:06:13,506 --> 01:06:14,574
Act lovely.

1244
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:16,075
I like you.

1245
01:06:16,075 --> 01:06:17,143
Try to be cute.

1246
01:06:17,143 --> 01:06:19,312
I really like you.

1247
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:20,379
Be brave.

1248
01:06:20,379 --> 01:06:22,381
I really like you.

1249
01:06:32,692 --> 01:06:34,427
What is this?

1250
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:50,343
I like you. I really like you, Dong Gu.

1251
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,715
Would you...

1252
01:06:56,515 --> 01:06:58,584
be willing to start a relationship with me?

1253
01:07:00,486 --> 01:07:01,721
Yoon Ah.

1254
01:07:49,435 --> 01:07:52,371
(Welcome to Waikiki)
