Maybe I should start cleaning.

4
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:17,300
Dong Gu, you... you...

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,908
Is that why you ran to the store when
there was a fire... and that coat too...

6
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:26,263
So, the person you like
isn't me, but Yoon Ah?

7
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:27,379
What?

8
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:30,937
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:32,963
Don't try to get out of it.
Ye Rin told me.

10
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:35,563
What? She said she'd keep it a secret.

11
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:37,514
She already told you?

12
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:44,524
Dong Gu, did Ye Rin get home okay?

13
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:45,729
What?

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,121
Wow, how absurd.

15
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:52,511
Wow, this is big news.

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,884
Wow!

17
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:56,813
Su Ah, what is it? Is something going on?

18
00:00:56,813 --> 00:01:00,365
Dong Gu doesn't like me.
He actually likes...

19
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:04,453
Hey, hey, hey! Get over here!

20
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,825
What is it?

21
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:08,510
What's with them?

22
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:14,274
I can't breathe.

23
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,204
Sorry, sorry.

24
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:19,093
Do you really like Yoon Ah?

25
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,278
Why did you act like you liked me?

26
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:24,519
I was worried that
Yoon Ah might find out.

27
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,536
What?

28
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:29,302
So, you used me because you
didn't want Yoon Ah to find out?

29
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:32,861
It just worked out that way.
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:36,561
Could you keep it
a secret for now, Su Ah?

31
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:38,590
- Why?
- Well...

32
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,674
I'm still very taken aback by it.

33
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:43,912
So, keep it a secret for now.

34
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:46,256
Su Ah, I'm asking you for a favor.

35
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:48,093
Please, please, please.

36
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:49,980
All right. Just stop it.

37
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,141
- Really?
- I said yes, so get out.

38
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,674
- Get going.
- Okay, I'm going.

39
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:01,778
But, Su Ah... could you give
this coat to Yoon Ah?

40
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:04,197
- I bought it for Yoon Ah.
- What?

41
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:07,599
Yoon Ah is a bit weak,
so she gets colds easily.

42
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,426
- And her coat is so thin.
- Okay, I'll give it to her. I will.

43
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:14,038
Thank you, Su Ah.

44
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:16,063
You're the best.

45
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,217
What is with him?

46
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:22,146
My pride hurts for some reason.

47
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:24,948
This is ridiculous. My gosh.

52

I'm sorry. Please wait a bit.

53
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:00,764
I'll get it somehow.

54

Please don't say anything to Mal Geum.

55
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,460

56

Hello? Chairman, Chairman?

57
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:14,109
This is driving me crazy.

58
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:20,610
Gosh.

59
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:30,955
Hey, you'll spend more on these
bandages than what you'll earn.

60
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:33,127
It will take you forever
to earn the money.

61
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:36,295
Then what do I do?
I have to do something.

62
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,275
Does Mal Geum know you're doing this?

63
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,298
She doesn't, right?

64
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,651
Just tell Mal Geum how you feel.

65
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:44,020
I'll tell her after I pay
for her breach of contract.

66
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,175
- Gosh.
- Hey, Doo Shik.

67
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,448
Someone's here for you.

68
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:49,364
Me? Who?

69
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,096
Mal Geum.

70
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:01,795
Is she that first love you told us about?

71
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:03,792
Huh? Yeah.

72
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,782
Where is the milk? Oh, milk.

73
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,723
Hey, hey... my milk!

74
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,953
Mal Geum likes lattes.

75
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,621
My goodness.

76
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,797
You were dying just a moment ago.

77
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:19,351
Now, you're full of life.

78
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:22,322
Love is a shocking thing.

79
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:25,904
Of course, the power of love
can really shock you.

80
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:27,103
Right, Dong Gu?

81
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:29,783
Hm? I don't know.

82
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:34,233
- Yoon Ah, you should take this.
- What?

83
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,882
Why would I?

84
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:39,824
You should just wear it.
It is much too small for me.

85
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:43,394
Still, it was a gift to you
from Dong Gu, so how can I?

86
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:46,293
It's fine. Dong Gu doesn't mind at all.

87
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,194
- Right, Dong Gu?
- Huh?

88
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:51,343
Oh, yeah. Of course, I don't mind.

89
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,954
Don't worry about it and wear it.

90
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:58,170
Su Ah and I are just friends.

91
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,408
That's right. We're friends.

92
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:04,666
Dong Gu must have
a love somewhere else.

93
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,831
What?

94
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:13,119
Anyway, you should wear this Yoon Ah.

95
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,711
Hand it over nicely.
Why are you throwing it?

96
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,661
I wanted to.

97
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:21,322
But Sol cries when I get within
one meter of her, so what can I do?

98
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,761
Does that make sense?

99
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:23,862
Want to see?

100
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,499
Why are you making him cry?

101
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:33,012
- Oh?
- What's with that?

102
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,209
Awesome!

103
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,988
This little thing can already
differentiate between good and bad.

104
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:40,475
What a genius. You're evil.

105
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,343
Genius and evil.

106
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:47,091
Joon Ki, what did you say?
You want to die?

107
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,285
I momentarily lost my mind.

108
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,750
Seeing these pictures
reminds me of the past.

109
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,338
We were always
hanging out together, right?

110
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:02,153
- When did you start liking me anyway?
- What?

111
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:05,276
Why kind of question is that,
all of a sudden?

112
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:09,548
What is this then? What is it?

113
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,966
Oh, this...

114
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:14,244
You liked me, right? Since when?

115
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:15,795
Was I your first love?

116
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,252
No, no! This isn't...

117

Oh, you have a guest.

118
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:23,500
- Who is it?
- Oh, my friend.

119
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,435
Friend? Oh, that first love
you told us about?

120
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,449
Hey! What are you talking about?

121
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:30,470
It's not her.

122
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,298
- Get out, get out.
- Okay, I'll leave.

123
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:37,057
I even bought you these 
and you're getting mad at me.

124
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:38,516
Leave.

125
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:41,754
- Have a nice time.
- Hey!

126
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:48,435
Why do you need those bandages?
Are you injured?

127
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:51,834
Oh, it's nothing.
I was working construction...

128
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,985
- Construction?
- Huh?

129
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:58,204
A friend of mine said they're lacking
manpower so I'm helping out.

130
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:01,394
Is it because of me, by chance?

131
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:02,863
Is it my contract?

132
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:05,677
No, I took care of that already.

133
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:07,995
- Did you really?
- I did.

134
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:12,617
So, don't worry about anything and
just focus on your drama auditions.

135
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,793

136
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:25,867

Wow, that's amazing.

Thank you. You really saved me.

It just feels like I'm looking
at myself in the past.

179
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,591
Hoon, when you were young,
I was just like that.

180
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:56,091
I didn't know anything,
so everything was hectic for me.

181
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:59,259
I don't think that's it at all.

182
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:03,513
Dad, are you sure you didn't
fall for her at first sight?

183
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,686
Where are Joon Ki and Doo Shik?

184
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:12,315
Doo Shik is suffering from his cold.

185
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:15,644
Joon Ki is probably doing
something crazy somewhere.

186
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:17,336
Are you in a rush or something?

187
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:19,336
Why are you standing and eating?

188
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,115
I have to eat when I have time.

189
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,460
Why?

190
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,284
Because of this.

191
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:33,500
Sol doesn't seem to want to be
away from Yoon Ah lately.

192
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,889
So Yoon Ah can't sleep at all
and it's a big problem.

193
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:38,914
Oh, really?

194
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,836
Water.

195
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:45,360
What is with this fashion?

196
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,581
Where were you anyway?

197
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:48,889
- I went for a walk.
- A walk?

198
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,706
In this cold and in those clothes?

199
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:52,311
Yes, I need to catch a cold.

200
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:54,817
You need to catch a cold?
What do you mean by that?

201
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:56,192
Tell us so we understand.

202
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,878
I need a part-time job
in a human testing lab.

203
00:10:58,878 --> 00:10:59,966
So, I need a cold.

204
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:02,019
Isn't there a good way to catch a cold?

205
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,206
- He's crazy.
- I'm so sick.

206
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,461
Oh, this is good.

207
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,556
Ugh.

208
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:08,913
What the heck?

209
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,974
Why are you eating my candy?

210
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,695
Why else? I need to catch your cold.

211
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:15,511
So dirty. That won't
help you catch his cold.

212
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:18,586
You're right.
It's not enough. Eat it again.

213
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:19,649
Gosh.

214
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,854
I need a foolproof way to catch a cold.

215
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,657
Oh, this would work.

216
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:30,625
What, Joon Ki?
What's that dirty look in your eyes?

217
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,524
I thought of a foolproof way
to catch a cold.

218
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,270
Doo Shik.

219
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,235
Let's kiss just once.

220
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,678
What? K... kiss?

221
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:40,851
Are you crazy?

222
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:42,062
Don't come near me.

223
00:11:42,062 --> 00:11:44,081
I've never done it before.
Get away from me.

224
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:46,105
It's okay, it's okay.
It'll be over soon.

225
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,808
Get away from me.
I've never kissed anyone.

226
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,125
Doo Shik, it'll be over soon.

227
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,759
What are they doing?

228
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:17,897
Sol, where is your mom anyway?

229
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:20,860
What is this?

230
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,951
What is this all about?

231
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:30,489
Dong Gu, Yoon Ah... wake up.

232
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:41,572
- Why sleep here instead of your rooms?
- Huh?

233
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,149
I put Sol to sleep and fell asleep
while studying for the academy.

234
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,630
Oh.

235
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,600
Dong Gu, why are you
sleeping here next to Yoon Ah?

236
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,778
Huh? Oh, that...

237
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,677
Ow, my back.

238
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:04,110
I drank so much yesterday that
I didn't even know I slept here.

239
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,360
Oh, my head hurts.

240
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,811
Don't drink so much.

241
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,542
Don't you feel bad at all?

242
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:14,192
You must all be hungry.
I'll prepare breakfast.

243
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:16,133
I'll help you, Yoon Ah.

244
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,941
- You can watch Sol, Dong Gu.
- Okay.

245
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,644
Good morning, Sol.

246
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,957
Sol, did you sleep well?

247
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:28,903
Um, excuse me. Hot water, please?

248
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:31,267
Yes, one moment.

249
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,019
Yoon Ah, what are you doing?

250
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,212
What do you mean?

251
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,881
What do I do?

252
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:47,330
So hot!

253
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:49,721
- Ouch.
- Are you okay?

254
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,605
Are you okay, Yoon Ah?

255
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:53,653
I'm okay.

256
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:57,349
Sorry, I can't seem to
concentrate right now.

257
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:58,785
This won't do.

258
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:01,413
Yoon Ah, you're on break from now on.

259
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:04,875
So, don't do anything here
and go do whatever you'd like.

260
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,009
What? I'm really okay.

261
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:09,250
Hey, now. Do as you're told.

262
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,511
You're not going to listen?

263
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,451
It's not that--

264
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:14,912
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get going.

265
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:17,363
Yeah, go and get some rest.

266
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:19,500
- Still...
- Get going.

267
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,725
Go on. Say, "Bye, Mom."

268
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:27,918
All right. You're all done.

269
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:30,308
Press down on it until it stops bleeding.

270
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:33,961
And take this medication at 9:00.

271
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,912
Yes.

272
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:39,389
Hey, hey. This is the best part-time job.

273
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,836
I could do it forever.

274
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:46,048
They take some blood, give us medicine,
and we get two million won a week.

275
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,729
It's like free money, right?

276
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,149
Yeah.

277
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:56,071
<i>[Mal Geum]</i>

278
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,384
Isn't that Mal Geum?

279
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,130
Why aren't you picking up?

280
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,917
Just because I don't want her to worry.

281
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:10,270
Why would she worry when you have
the best part-time job?

282
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:16,312
Sol, your mom is on a break today.

283
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:19,220
Let's have fun playing together.

284
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,778
What a hardworking guy we have here.

285
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:24,772
You're even watching her kid for her.

286
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:27,610
When you were dating me,
you only cared about yourself.

287
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,836
You've changed a lot.

288
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:32,239
What do you mean?

289
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:36,032
What is it, Sol?

290
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:38,061
Do you want to eat it too, Sol?

291
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:40,562
No, you can't eat this.

292
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:44,236
Oh no. You can't eat this.

293
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:51,302
Sol, I gave you abalone porridge too.

294
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,493
So, you sit here for a bit, okay?

295
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:57,484
You like that? Me too.

296
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:01,589
Where did I put that file
for the baby's birthday party?

297
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:04,595
It's time for your medication.

298
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:07,605
Again? We're taking it quite often.

299
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,442
Oh, what's wrong with my voice?

300
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,328
- You're right. It's weird.
- Oh.

301
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:12,938
What's wrong with my voice?

302
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:16,172
Is it because our colds are severe?

303
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:18,798
Ah, ah, ah.

304
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,028
- Ah, ah.
- Ah. Hey.

305
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:24,414
Isn't my voice kind of sexy?

306
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:27,864
Doo Shik.

307
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:29,553
Should we play?

308
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:32,383
Oh, stop. Don't do this.

309
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,317
It's sexy. Very sexy.

310
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,665
Please stop that.

311
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,384
Excuse me. Just take your medicine.

312
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:41,864
Let's do so.

313
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:44,057
I don't want medicine.

314
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:45,929
Should I feed you
or do you want to come here?

315
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,096
Joon Ki, kiss me.

316
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:50,377
Oh my god.

317
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,464
Oh my god!

318
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:05,848
Oh, I'm tired.

319
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,531
How long do I have to live doing
these baby birthday party gigs?

320
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:13,781
I miss the film industry. I really do.

321
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:14,848
What are you doing?

322
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:16,016
Can't you tell?

323
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:18,858
I'm drinking coffee and editing
the videos for the baby birthday party.

324
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,557
Yeah? What about Sol?

325
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,644
Sol? She's right here.

326
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:27,047
Where did Sol go? Where is Sol?

327
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,451
Oh, Sol!

328
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:30,900
Hey, why would Sol be there?

329
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,401
Where is Sol?

330
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:35,198
Can't you see I'm looking? Where is she?

331
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,538
- Sol, Sol!
- Sol!

332
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:39,836
Sol wouldn't be in here.

333
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:41,327
Sol! Hey.

334
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,346
Sol, where are you? Sol.

335
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,179
Sol, where are you?

336
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,392
Sol.

337
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,999
Sol, where did you go?

338
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,509
Here you are. No, you aren't.

339
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,423
Sol!

340
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:56,493
Sol!

341
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:58,731
Where could she have possibly gone?

342
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:01,269
What are you going to do now, huh?

343
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:03,221
What if something's happened to Sol?

344
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:05,035
I'm going crazy too!

345
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:08,272
How are we going to find her?

346
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,285
This was your amazing method
of finding Sol?

347
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,874
Sol will cry if she goes
within one meter of her.

348
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:25,605
Looking for her like this will be faster
than if we just look alone.

349
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:28,073
Hey, are you looking for a water source?

350
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:29,565
Am I a radar?

351
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:31,512
Aren't you asking too much of me lately?

352
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:33,534
What can we do? We have to find her.

353
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:36,084
Stretch out your arms. Good.

354
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,375
Let's go.

355
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:42,194
This way.

356
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:49,108
Oh, what was that?

357
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:51,038
Isn't that Sol crying?

358
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,950
Look, there's nothing here.
What do you mean?

359
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,390
I know I heard something.

360
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,413
Is it the bed?

361
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:05,471
Does that make sense?
How could she get into the bed?

362
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,412
There you are!

363
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:10,123
- Oh my.
- What?

364
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:12,732
How did she get up there alone?

365
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:15,006
Does that make sense?
Does that make any sense at all?

366
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,265
Why is that important?
We found her, didn't we?

367
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:20,227
Sol, how did you get up there?

368
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,729
I was so worried about you.

369
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:25,036
I'm relieved nothing happened to her.

370
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:29,634
Wait. Why are her cheeks so red?

371
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,496
Hold on, Sol.

372
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,828
Oh! She has a fever.

373
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:35,038
What?

374
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:39,013
She really does.
Why does she suddenly have a fever?

375
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:40,499
Sol.

376
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,766
Lee Joon Ki and Bong Doo Shik, wake up.

377
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:46,395
We need to draw blood.

378
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,671
Again?

379
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:54,308
Ah... ah, ah, ah.

380
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,278
What? What's wrong with my voice?

381
00:20:56,278 --> 00:20:58,621
What's with your voice, Joon Ki?

382
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:02,950
What's wrong with my voice? Ah, ah...

383
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,221
Why are their voices like that?

384
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:07,535
What? Mine is like that too.

385
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:11,313
Oh! Mine too.

386
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,615
What's going on here? This is a problem.

387
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:14,920
Doctor!

388
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,058
What's going on here?
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

389
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:19,980
What's wrong my voice?

390
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,919
This is seriously insane.

391
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,759
- Ah, ah, ah.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

392
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,150
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

393
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,848
Testing... ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

394
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:34,750
It won't stop.

395
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,290
Ma'am, one order of the blood sausage.

396
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,685
- One moment, please.
- Sure.

397
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:45,250
Oh, hello.

398
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,839
Oh, you're the person
who helped me with Sol.

399
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,673
- It's you, right?
- Yes.

400
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:51,010
We meet again.

401
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,391
Where is that cute baby?
You're alone today.

402
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:57,383
Ah, her dad must be
watching her today, right?

403
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,450
No, Sol doesn't have a dad.
I'm raising her by myself.

404
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,846
Oh, I see.

405
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:06,559
I left my son, Hoon, with a babysitter
and I was having a day out too.

406
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,634
So, you're on a date with your wife?

407
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:14,538
No, I separated from
my wife six years ago.

408
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,451
I realized that we don't even know
each other's names yet.

409
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:19,960
I'm Song Hyun Joon.

410
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,768
I'm Han Yoon Ah.

411
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:23,652
It was nice seeing you again, Yoon Ah.

412
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:25,519
Yes, it was nice to see you.

413
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:29,093
You have something...

414
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:30,199
right here.

415
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:34,132
What? Oh, when did Sol do that?

416
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:38,102
Oh, that little baby did it.

417
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:41,173
Gosh, my Hoon vomited so much too.

418
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:43,746
I didn't have any decent clothes.

419
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:46,229
One moment.

420
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:50,480
Yes, Seo Jin. What is it?

421
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,373
What?

422
00:22:53,678 --> 00:22:55,116
Sol?

423
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:58,904
Yes, okay. I'll be right there. Okay.

424
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:00,527
What is it? Is something wrong?

425
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:02,967
Sol is sick. I'd better get going now.

426
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:04,212
Yes.

427
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:13,248
Sol... Sol!

428
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:15,163
What's wrong my Sol?

429
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:18,298
They say it's intestinal inflammation.

430
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,718
Intestinal inflammation?
Why would she have that?

431
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:22,246
She was fine this morning.

432
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:24,164
It seems she ate something
she shouldn't have.

433
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:26,307
I didn't feed her anything.

434
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:28,688
You know I can't get
within one meter of her.

435
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:29,900
It can't be that.

436
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,191
Well, I did feed her something.

437
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:35,527
What did you feed her?

438
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:38,326
A little bit of bread from a corn dog.

439
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:39,548
Bread from a corn dog?

440
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:45,044
I really wasn't going to give it to her,
but Sol looked so desperate to eat it.

441
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:48,530
But it is organic bread.

442
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,287
There wasn't anything else?

443
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:54,534
A little bit of ham and abalone...

444
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,391
What? Ham and abalone?

445
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:59,428
It was abalone porridge... porridge.

446
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:00,615
Are you insane, Dong Gu?

447
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:04,009
How can you feed ham and abalone
to a baby who's still breastfeeding?

448
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,828
How can you be so thoughtless?

449
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:09,417
Sorry, I thought she could eat it.

450
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:13,069
I'm really sorry, Yoon Ah.

451
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:19,251
No, it's my fault for
not telling you earlier.

452
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:25,759
Sol, I'm sorry for leaving you.
I shouldn't have left.

453
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,057
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,224
Ah, ah.

455
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:33,288
Gosh, what is this?

456
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:35,935
What kind of side effect is this?

457
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:38,489
What if our voices never come back?

458
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:40,585
I know.

459
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:44,118
Those jerks.
What kind of medicine is that?

460
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:45,913
Let's hurry home for now.

461
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,635
Taxi!

462
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:50,628
Taxi, taxi.

463
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:58,307
Mister, can you take us to Huam-dong?

464
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:00,207
Huam-dong.

465
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,675
The Waikiki Guest House.

466
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:07,096
What's wrong?

467
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:10,521
Oh, it must be because of our voices.

468
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:14,684
Mister, we're not playing a joke.
We were subjects in a research lab.

469
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:16,634
This is the side effect of a medication.

470
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:19,144
We're not kidding. It's the truth.

471
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:24,237
What is it?

472
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,095
What is it, Mister?

473
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:32,008
It's true. It's a side effect.
We're not playing a joke on you.

474
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:33,519
Yeah right, you punks.

475
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,228
You're doing this because of me.
You're making fun of me!

476
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:40,622
You're dead. You're both dead today!

477
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:01,977
What are you doing?

478
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:04,412
Oh, you're here?

479
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:06,115
You should go in if you want.

480
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,826
I do want to, but...

481
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:12,115
I can't face Yoon Ah and Sol
because I feel so bad.

482
00:26:14,828 --> 00:26:17,609
I don't know why I was so stupid.

483
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,800
Dong Gu, may I ask you one question?

484
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,019
What is it?

485
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,140
About you liking Yoon Ah...

486
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,848
Did you think about her situation
and Sol when you started it?

487
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,311
What do you mean by that?

488
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:35,035
Yoon Ah has Sol and everything.

489
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,162
You have the confidence
to handle all of that, right?

490
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:45,211
Don't tell me you never thought about it.

491
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,092
I may be overstepping.

492
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:52,815
If you don't think you can handle it,
don't even start anything.

493
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,925
Yoon Ah's already someone
who's been hurt a lot.

494
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:07,276
I thought you guys would be gone
a few days, so why are you back?

495
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:09,422
Is the job done?

496
00:27:12,741 --> 00:27:15,058
So, did you make some money?

497
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,993
How much did you get paid?

498
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:23,760
So frustrating. What are you saying?

499
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,673
That hurts. Why are you hitting me?

500
00:27:25,673 --> 00:27:27,759
What's with your voice, Joon Ki?

501
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,853
Well, it's an adverse side effect
from the medicine.

502
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:33,782
This is all your fault!

503
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,457
Where did you find
a crappy job like that?

504
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:36,680
Who told you to come?

505
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,199
Why did you come and throw a fit?

506
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,989
What? You did nothing right,
so why get mad?

507
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:41,404
What did I do wrong? What?

508
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:43,605
My voice is like this because of you.

509
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:45,317
What the heck is this?

510
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:47,520
Of all the things they do...

511
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,784
It's your fault!

512
00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:56,536
<i>[Mal Geum]</i>
It's Mal Geum.

513
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:59,348
I can't get the phone with this voice.
What do I do?

514
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,497
Seo Jin, you pick up.

515
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:05,053
Gosh. Give it to me.

516
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:08,798
Yes, hello.

517
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,982
Yes, this is Doo Shik's phone,
but he's in the bathroom right now.

518
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,981
If you give me a message,
I'll relay it to him.

519
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:18,433
Uh, okay.

520
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:19,454
Yes.

521
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:22,236
- What did she say?
- Mal Geum has something to say.

522
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:24,035
She wants to meet you outside the house.

523
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,701
Huh? Something to say?
What could it be?

524
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,786
Maybe she's going to tell you
she has feelings for you.

525
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:33,310
Feelings? Oh, I doubt that.

526
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,480
Oh, you'd like that.

527
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,501
You're hoping for that.

528
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,432
Don't pretend to be innocent.

529
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:41,564
Stop that. Stop that.

530
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:44,398
I don't know what she'll say.

531
00:28:50,866 --> 00:28:53,181
Sorry for calling you out so suddenly.

532
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:57,280
I had something I wanted to tell you.

533
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,487
Well...

534
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,137
I...

535
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,417
I agreed to work with
the agency's chairman again.

536
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:08,417
What?

537
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,458
What are you talking about?

538
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,238
Doo Shik, what's wrong with your voice?

539
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,250
Ah, ah. It's nothing.

540
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,362
I have a bit of a cold.

541
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:20,601
Ah, ah.

542
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,423
What do you mean
you're working with him again?

543
00:29:23,423 --> 00:29:25,836
So, you're making erotic films again?

544
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:27,229
No.

545
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:31,137
He has a drama he's working on
with a Chinese production company.

546
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:33,021
He says I can be in it.

547
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,961
So, I'm going to China.

548
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:37,996
- When?
- Tomorrow.

549
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:41,196
I'm going in a rush
because of the filming schedule.

550
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:42,558
That quickly?

551
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:47,998
Mal Geum, did you happen to hear
something from the chairman?

552
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:49,167
Hear what?

553
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:53,642
Oh, that you were paying off the fee
for my breach of contract?

554
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,287
I already knew about that.

555
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,713
I knew you were working
those jobs because of me.

556
00:29:59,713 --> 00:30:01,887
I pretended not to know.

557
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:05,097
I wanted to run away, no matter how.

558
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:08,268
Then are you working with him again
because of money?

559
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:11,185
Mal Geum, I'll get
the money somehow, so--

560
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:13,919
No, it's not just because of the money.

561
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,729
It's because I want to do it.

562
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,996
No matter how much I try here

563
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:22,233
I can't do anything
because of my history.

564
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:26,306
So, I want to start over in a place
where no one knows me.

565
00:30:29,182 --> 00:30:30,333
Do you have to go?

566
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,881
Can't you not go?

567
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,856
It's a really good opportunity for me.

568
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,988
I don't want to lose
this opportunity, Doo Shik.

569
00:30:41,945 --> 00:30:44,236
You'll be rooting for me, right?

570
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:51,145
Thanks. I really
wanted you to support me.

571
00:30:51,703 --> 00:30:53,015
Oh yeah.

572
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:57,242
While I was packing,
I found pictures of us together.

573
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:58,490
So I brought them.

574
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:09,237
Doo Shik, I'm thankful
for everything you've done for me.

575
00:31:09,237 --> 00:31:10,586
Very thankful.

576
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:16,260
I'll get going then.
Please be well.

577
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:41,338
<i>Who is this that
you drew hearts like this?</i>

578
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:42,929
My first love.

579
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,228
Is our Sol all better now?

580
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:20,165
Was your tummy hurting
because of that crazy uncle?

581
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,368
You're crazy.

582
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:28,674
How can you feed ham and abalone to
a baby who's still breastfeeding?

583
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,973
That's enough. He didn't know.

584
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:33,882
Don't worry too much, Dong Gu.
Sol is all better now.

585
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:36,902
Sol, come here.

586
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:40,484
Sol, you're all better now, right?

587
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:43,525
<i>I may be overstepping.</i>

588
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:47,125
If you don't think you can handle it,
don't even start anything.

589
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:51,564
Yoon Ah's already someone
who's been hurt a lot.

590
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:53,797
<i>Can I handle it?</i>

591
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:57,001
<i>I couldn't even protect Sol.</i>

592
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:58,209
Are you okay?

593
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,912
<i>I can't even take care of myself.</i>

594
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:04,990
What's with him?

595
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,388
He was in the wrong,
so why's he acting like a victim?

596
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:13,414
Wow, you have a great life.

597
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:16,894
You take naps even though
you should be looking for a job.

598
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,555
I was preparing for interviews all night,
so I took a short nap.

599
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:20,599
What about you?

600
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,715
You say you're an actor,
but you work weird part-time jobs.

601
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,911
What? Weird part-time jobs?

602
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:30,102
Hey, I sacrificed my body for
the development of new medicine.

603
00:33:30,102 --> 00:33:32,106
Seo Jin, don't be like that.

604
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:34,675
Why don't you give up on a job
and go in for human testing?

605
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:37,938
You know, for women's hair removal.
Not many women have mustaches.

606
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:39,958
- It's all rough and prickly.
- Why you...

607
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,534
You want to die? Do you?

608
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:42,964
Chewbacca is killing someone.

609
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:45,615
Jedi, help me. Jedi!

610
00:33:45,615 --> 00:33:47,394
Stop it, would you?

611
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:48,969
You two fight every time you meet.

612
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:50,026
Leave them be.

613
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:51,967
They'll end up liking each other
at some point.

614
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,644
What? Liking each other?

615
00:33:53,644 --> 00:33:55,777
Why would you say such a horrific thing?

616
00:33:55,777 --> 00:34:00,005
He is the man I have the
lowest opinion of in the world.

617
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,391
Even if we were the only ones
left on a deserted island

618
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:03,803
I wouldn't go near him.

619
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:05,065
I don't like you either.

620
00:34:05,065 --> 00:34:08,070
If we were on a deserted island,
I'd rather live with a sea turtle.

621
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,456
I won't live with you.

622
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:11,538
A sea turtle doesn't have a mustache.

623
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:12,929
They're smooth.

624
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,760
I just got a call from that sea turtle.

625
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,605
It says it doesn't like
loser types like you.

626
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:19,034
- Loser?
- What?

627
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:26,007
- This is mine.
- What?

628
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,882
Gosh, why did you buy
the same phone as mine?

629
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:36,369
I bought it first.
I don't like anything about you.

630
00:34:39,364 --> 00:34:41,476
What is that sound?

631
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:45,121
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

632
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:48,865
<i>Though I have nothing great to offer you.</i>

633
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:53,934
<i>Shamelessly, I want you for myself.</i>

634
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:57,153
Does he really want to sing
that song with that voice?

635
00:34:57,153 --> 00:34:58,501
Be understanding.

636
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:00,512
Mal Geum is leaving Korea today.

637
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:01,617
Ah...

638
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:03,432
His side effect is lasting a long time.

639
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:05,889
Listen to that voice. Gosh.

640
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:11,336
<i>You are...</i>

641
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:14,047
Dong Gu, would you stop Doo Shik?

642
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:21,101
<i>I want it so badly.</i>

643
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:24,378
<i>Please love me.</i>

644
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:27,909
<i>Please don't make me cry.</i>

645
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:35,121
<i>This one word,
more commonly spoken than breathing.</i>

646
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:41,512
<i>I cannot say it with confidence
and I am always hiding.</i>

647
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:47,934
<i>I am nothing but a coward.</i>

648
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:49,626
What's wrong with him?

649
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:53,954
This house is never normal.
It never is.

650
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:57,159
<i>Please love me.</i>

651
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:00,438
<i>Please don't make me cry.</i>

652
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:07,824
<i>This one word,
more commonly spoken than breathing.</i>

653
00:36:07,824 --> 00:36:09,536
- Doo Shik.
- Dong Gu.

654
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:12,717
I am a coward.

655
00:36:15,748 --> 00:36:17,246
I'm a coward too.

656
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:20,188
<i>[My Gangster Lover]</i>

657
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:23,306
I'm Seoul District Prosecutor
Kang Ji Wan.

658
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,197
Do you want to come quietly
or should we fight?

659
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:27,567
It's your choice.

660
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:30,297
However, if we have to fight...

661
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:33,036
you'll have to put your life on the line.

662
00:36:33,686 --> 00:36:34,784
What are you doing?

663
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,530
Can't you tell?

664
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,652
What's your role this time?

665
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:41,103
A prosecutor, prosecutor.

666
00:36:41,103 --> 00:36:45,114
A prosecutor who goes up
against gangsters, at that.

667
00:36:45,114 --> 00:36:47,489
A prosecutor, with that face?

668
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:49,239
You're not some gangster or street thug?

669
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,788
The director has a bad eye for people.

670
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:52,923
Chewbacca, are you going to
talk to me that way?

671
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:55,557
I think I'll have some ramen.

672
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:58,061
You don't even support me.

673
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:02,179
Why isn't this turning on?

674
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:04,907
Joon Ki, come take a look.

675
00:37:04,907 --> 00:37:07,483
You're only nice when you need me.

676
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:10,956
Just take a look.
It was working before.

677
00:37:10,956 --> 00:37:14,340
It was fine before.
Why wouldn't it work? Move.

678
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:16,981
Why isn't it working?

679
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:21,730
Let me see here.

680
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,237
I turned it on. How weird.

681
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:27,454
Joon Ki!

682
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:32,391
Geez. What is this?

683
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:34,356
Hey, you.

684
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:38,903
How could you turn the switch on
when I had my face up near the range?

685
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:43,096
Sorry, I didn't think it would
turn on so suddenly.

686
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:45,322
Of course, fire lights up suddenly!

687
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,987
I'm seriously going crazy here.

688
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:52,715
I have a scene to film.
How am I supposed to go like this?

689
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,143
What's been with you all day, Dong Gu?

690
00:37:55,143 --> 00:37:56,894
Is something wrong?

691
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:58,329
Leave him alone.

692
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:00,478
This isn't the first time
he's tried to look cool.

693
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,215
Go away, you and you fake cool act.

694
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:05,900
Stop that. I'm not in a good mood.

695
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:10,177
What's that? Joon Ki, your eyebrow.

696
00:38:10,177 --> 00:38:12,365
Did you wax it?

697
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:14,485
Your eyebrow's gone.

698
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:16,619
Don't laugh, you punk. Don't laugh!

699
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,621
This is all your sister's fault.
Don't laugh!

700
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:23,440
What's that?

701
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,708
- It's a model set.
- A model set?

702
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:28,762
Oh, your voice is back.

703
00:38:28,762 --> 00:38:30,521
It came back this morning.

704
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:32,123
Why do you have that model set?

705
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,251
I just felt a little down.

706
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:41,996
What's going on with your eyebrow?

707
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:44,088
Don't laugh, don't laugh!

708
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,952
You seemed practically dead
just a moment ago.

709
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:50,045
So, why did you buy that model set
when you're down?

710
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:54,398
Oh, I thought I could organize my
thoughts if I completed this.

711
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:58,157
Yeah, then let me join you, Doo Shik.

712
00:38:58,157 --> 00:39:00,523
I have a lot to think about too.

713
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:02,722
Sure, you can join me.

714
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:04,963
But, isn't that really funny?

715
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:07,143
I know.

716
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:09,934
Just shave the other one too.

717
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,885
Is he Harvey Dent or what?

718
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:13,286
Don't laugh!

719
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:20,625
Hey, have you ever done this before?

720
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:25,862
It's harder than it looks
and it's not for everyone.

721
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:26,889
What?

722
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:30,940
I can make this with my eyes shut
in half a day.

723
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,030
Really?

724
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,682
Once I open up a box

725
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:37,574
I don't eat or sleep until I complete it.

726
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:38,875
Is that okay with you?

727
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:43,101
If you're going to give up in the middle,
then just leave now.

728
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:45,614
I will never give up.

729
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:49,266
If you don't think you can do it,
don't hang around here and go.

730
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:53,309
Then, shall we get started?

731
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:54,547
Shall we?

Su Ah, what do you think of this?

You like an idiot
who drew on his eyebrows.

734
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:05,905
What? An idiot?

735
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:07,951
Geez.

736
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:12,038
Su Ah, how about this?

737
00:40:12,038 --> 00:40:14,199
You like an idiot
who has tape on his face.

738
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,389
An idiot with tape?

739
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:18,818
I'm going crazy here.

Call them and ask
if they have eyebrow wigs.

Are you kidding right now?

00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:36,849
You're pouring fuel on a burning house.

Kang Seo Jin, what are you
going to do about this?

How can I go on set like this?

750

I said I was sorry.

751
00:40:46,773 --> 00:40:48,360
I'll be going to my interview then.

Hey, you ruined my filming today
and you can actually go interview?

00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,876
Sorry. I said sorry. I'm sorry.

Bye.

Have a good interview.
I'm always rooting for you.

a reporter, Kang Seo Jin?

764
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,177
I believe a reporter
can change the world.

765
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:47,927
I hope to write articles to right
the injustices of the world.

766
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:50,170
I want to be the voice

I want to make the world
a little better to live in.

No. Not at all. I really didn't.

All right. You may leave.

- Is sorry going to fix it?

However, if we have to fight,

But you're going to say your lines
like that, seriously?

Do you know what happened to me
at the interview because of this?

Hey, I got cursed at on set
and lost my role because of you!

00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:41,824
I said sorry for that.

Do you know how important
this interview was for me?

821
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:47,315
Are you going to take responsibility
if I don't pass? Are you?

00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:49,036
What? Hey.

Why would you play
that kind of joke, Joon Ki?

833
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:33,202
What? Is it my fault?

834

837
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:46,221
She failed, so what can we do about it?

838
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:51,380
Are those two still doing that?

839
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:54,347
They haven't eaten all day.

00:48:05,027 --> 00:48:07,106
Oh, really?

882
00:48:07,987 --> 00:48:12,902
"Knowing Bros" is canceled,
so we'd better get started.

883
00:48:12,902 --> 00:48:14,045
Yes.

884
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:17,030
"Knowing Bros" is canceled.

885
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,490
We should start building it again.

886
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,425
Where are Dong Gu and Doo Shik?

887
00:48:28,425 --> 00:48:29,664
I don't know.

888
00:48:29,664 --> 00:48:32,489
They were building that model
and didn't come into the room all night.

889
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:34,306
They're still at it?

890
00:48:34,306 --> 00:48:37,054
They're more persistent than I thought.

891
00:48:37,054 --> 00:48:39,228
They must have a lot on their minds.

892
00:48:39,228 --> 00:48:41,063
I pity those two.

893
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:46,858
Where's Seo Jin?

894
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:48,170
She doesn't want to eat.

895
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,498
She's been crying all day
under the blanket.

896
00:48:50,498 --> 00:48:51,681
I'm worried about her.

897
00:48:53,161 --> 00:48:54,900
Go apologize first, Joon Ki.

898
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,943
Why should I?

899
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:59,539
Hey, I'm the victim here.
Don't you see my eyebrow?

900
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:01,679
Still, you went too far.

901
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:03,509
Just let it go this time, Joon Ki.

902
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:06,568
Yeah, Seo Jin is crying.

903
00:49:07,586 --> 00:49:10,907
Fine! She is so petty.

904
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,371
Chewbacca, aren't you going to eat?

905
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:31,400
I don't want to talk, so leave.

906
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,077
I'm sorry, okay?

907
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:41,657
I didn't think you'd go all the way to
the interview with that on your back.

908
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,226
So don't be mad anymore, okay?

909
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:45,813
Whatever. Just leave.

910
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:48,202
I'm apologizing to you first like this.
Can't you accept?

911
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:51,931
Truthfully, it's not all my fault that
you didn't pass the interview.

912
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,929
I know that.

913
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:56,610
I know very well that
it wasn't because of you.

914
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,311
Then why are you being like this?

915
00:49:58,311 --> 00:50:00,864
It's not the first time
you didn't pass an interview.

916
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:04,561
This... was my last interview.

917
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:07,590
What do you mean by that? Your last one?

918
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:11,351
I was going to give up on being
a reporter if I didn't pass this time.

919
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:13,661
I made the decision
to look for other jobs.

920
00:50:14,672 --> 00:50:18,989
Now that I got rejected,
I'm just so upset.

921
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:24,311
So, don't worry about me and just leave.

922
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:26,869
Let me be alone and go.

923
00:50:49,117 --> 00:50:50,965
Hey, hey.

924
00:50:51,704 --> 00:50:52,786
What are you doing?

925
00:50:52,786 --> 00:50:55,340
Sleep in your room if you're tired.
Why are you sleeping here?

926
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,302
Sleeping? Who?

927
00:50:57,302 --> 00:50:59,775
Me? I wasn't.

928
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:04,398
I was just blinking very slowly.

929
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:08,675
Ah... you were sleeping, Doo Shik.

930
00:51:08,675 --> 00:51:09,905
I didn't sleep.

931
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,152
I was thinking.

932
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,204
About how to build
this model in a cool way.

933
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:17,963
<i>Honestly, I was sleeping.</i>

934
00:51:17,963 --> 00:51:19,952
<i>I was sleeping sweetly.</i>

935
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:23,842
<i>I was about to fall into REM sleep,
but I woke up.</i>

936
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,985
<i>I want to sleep comfortably in my bed.</i>

937
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:31,367
<i>But this guy will look down on me
if I suggest sleeping.</i>

938
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:33,431
<i>I'm going crazy.</i>

939
00:51:33,431 --> 00:51:35,177
<i>I want to sleep.</i>

940
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:37,534
<i>My eyes are starting to close.</i>

941
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,998
<i>Should I just go and sleep?</i>

942
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:45,742
<i>Then this guy will
look down on me and tease me.</i>

943
00:51:45,742 --> 00:51:47,302
<i>What do I do?</i>

944
00:51:52,286 --> 00:51:55,447
Oh... oh dear.

945
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:57,050
What do we do?

946
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,675
What? What is it?

947
00:51:58,675 --> 00:52:00,364
Look at this.

948
00:52:00,364 --> 00:52:04,324
My fingers are glued together
because of the glue.

949
00:52:06,782 --> 00:52:10,393
Look. Oh no.
My fingers are glued together too.

950
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,550
What about it?

951
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:18,052
You need your index finger and thumb
the most when you build these models.

952
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:21,128
But they're stuck together.

953
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:24,239
We can't build it even if we want to.

954
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,204
Yes, it's really too bad.

955
00:52:27,204 --> 00:52:30,329
What can we do
with our fingers like this?

956
00:52:31,077 --> 00:52:33,130
I really wanted to complete it.

957
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,528
I'm really upset
but this must be the end of the road.

958
00:52:36,518 --> 00:52:38,358
Do you really want to
complete it that much?

959
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:39,739
Of course.

960
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,083
Why would you even ask?

961
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:43,083
Don't worry. I have acetone.

962
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:46,036
You can use acetone
to make the glue come off.

963
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:47,302
I'll do it for you.

964
00:52:47,302 --> 00:52:49,159
No, acetone won't work.

965
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:51,043
I doubt that.

966
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:55,773
It's very strong glue.
How could acetone work?

967
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:58,255
It would probably take a very long time.

968
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:01,523
It won't come off so easily.

969
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:06,681
- Doo Shik.
- Me too?

970
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,172
See? It works fast.

971
00:53:16,172 --> 00:53:17,960
Now you can work on it all you want.

972
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,494
Acetone.

973
00:53:24,193 --> 00:53:27,025
You just stay put.

974
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:31,224
Prosecutor or whatever you are,
if you take one more step...

975
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,244
I'll just...

976
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,744
Seriously, that girl.

977
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,577
I can't act because
this eyebrow is bothering me.

978
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,778
- Hello.
- <i>Yes, hello.</i>

979
00:53:48,778 --> 00:53:50,722
<i>Is this Kang Seo Jin's phone?</i>

980
00:53:50,722 --> 00:53:53,130
What? Kang Seo Jin?

981
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:58,760
Oh, we switched phones again.

982
00:54:00,293 --> 00:54:01,503
What is this about?

983
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:03,012
<i>This is Joyoung Daily</i>

984
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:05,318
<i>where she's supposed to
come for her second interview.</i>

985
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:08,235
What? She got a text yesterday
that she didn't pass the first one.

986
00:54:08,235 --> 00:54:10,369
<i>Kang Seo Jin passed the first interview.</i>

987
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:11,784
<i>I guess they sent the wrong text.</i>

988
00:54:11,784 --> 00:54:13,193
What did you say?

989
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:16,418
How can you say that now?
Never mind.

990
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:18,615
What time is the interview?

991
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:21,585
What? 2:00 pm?

992
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:32,831
What? Is there another
"Huam-dong's Hairy"?

993
00:54:34,206 --> 00:54:35,487
Hello.

994
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:37,197
Yeah. It's me, Seo Jin.

995
00:54:37,197 --> 00:54:39,170
What? It's you, Joon Ki?

996
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:41,726
What is it?

997
00:54:41,726 --> 00:54:43,597
The thing is...

998
00:54:43,597 --> 00:54:47,157
I accidentally left
with your phone again.

999
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:48,456
Again?

1000
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:51,746
So, you saved my number as
"Huam-dong's Hairy"?

1001
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,010
That's not the important part.

1002
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,081
Seo Jin, you passed the first interview.

1003
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:57,467
What? What are you talking about?

1004
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:59,889
Joyoung Daily just called your phone.

1005
00:54:59,889 --> 00:55:01,403
They want you to come in again.

1006
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:03,369
Is that true?

1007
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:07,402
So you need to go to the seminar room
at Joyoung Daily, 10th floor by 2:00.

1008
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:08,789
2:00 pm?

1009
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:12,952
- What do I do?
- <i>What?</i>

1010
00:55:12,952 --> 00:55:15,324
You can get ready quickly,
take a taxi, and get there.

1011
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:18,311
I came out to get some air and
I'm on a bus to see the ocean.

1012
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:19,876
I've already come a long way.

1013
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:22,547
Even if I go quickly,
I'll be too late.

1014
00:55:22,547 --> 00:55:24,228
Then you're going to give up?

1015
00:55:24,228 --> 00:55:26,425
You said this was your last interview.

1016
00:55:26,425 --> 00:55:28,458
But, the time...

1017
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,947
I'll do what I can. Just get here.

1018
00:55:31,947 --> 00:55:33,289
Hang up.

1019
00:55:38,784 --> 00:55:40,021
Mister!

1020
00:55:40,911 --> 00:55:41,969
Please stop.

1021
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:44,210
We're going get started soon.

1022
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,646
Please stand by!

1023
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:46,851
Yes!

1024
00:55:56,088 --> 00:55:59,255
Excuse me. Where are you going?

1025
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:03,864
We have a new instructor today,
so I'd like to introduce him.

1026
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:05,184
Please come in.

1027
00:56:11,103 --> 00:56:12,251
Hyun Joon?

1028
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:16,432
Yoon Ah, what are you doing here?

1029
00:56:16,432 --> 00:56:20,173
Excuse me. We need to
introduce you to the class first.

1030
00:56:20,173 --> 00:56:22,248
Yes, I'm sorry.

1031
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:25,003
- I'll talk to you later, Yoon Ah.
- Okay.

1032
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:30,121
Hello, everyone.

1033
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:32,090
I'll be teaching your class
starting today.

1034
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,713
My name is Song Hyun Joon.
It's nice to meet you all.

1035
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:40,778
I can't believe it.

1036
00:56:40,778 --> 00:56:42,208
- So awesome.
- Why?

1037
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,467
Is he that famous?

1038
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,349
He's a star patisseur and
one of the famous few in our country.

1039
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:47,418
Really?

1040
00:56:53,255 --> 00:56:55,318
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1041
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,842
- Excuse me.
- Oh my gosh.

1042
00:56:59,842 --> 00:57:02,329
How much time
until the interviews are over?

1043
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:04,425
- They're over.
- They're over?

1044
00:57:04,425 --> 00:57:07,590
Could you wait a little longer?

1045
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,023
That will be difficult because
the managers have a schedule too.

1046
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:16,300
What happens if you don't make it
to the interview today?

1047
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,800
I suppose you would fail this round.

1048
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,061
Fail...

1049
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,018
How can you do that?

1050
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:23,940
It was your error that caused it!

1051
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,268
I don't know what you're referring to.

1052
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:27,317
What do I do?

1053
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:31,378
<i>[Interview Location]</i>

1054
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:34,987
This is crazy, crazy, crazy.

1055
00:57:34,987 --> 00:57:37,478
Hey, where are you going?

1056
00:57:38,807 --> 00:57:40,463
This is crazy, crazy, crazy.

1057
00:57:40,463 --> 00:57:42,871
Hey, where are you going?

1058
00:57:42,871 --> 00:57:44,853
Good work, everyone.

1059
00:57:44,853 --> 00:57:46,648
You can't go in there!

1060
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:48,608
What is this?

1061
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:51,085
Don't move.

1062
00:57:51,085 --> 00:57:52,556
What do you think you're doing?

1063
00:57:53,405 --> 00:57:54,844
Who is this person?

1064
00:57:58,206 --> 00:57:59,775
All of you stay put.

1065
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:01,485
Prosecutor or whatever you are...

1066
00:58:01,485 --> 00:58:02,606
No, wait...

1067
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:07,905
Interviewers or whatever you are,
you're dead if you take one more step.

1068
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:09,860
Who are you and
what do you think you're doing?

1069
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,068
Shut up!

1070
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:13,213
Stay calm if you don't want to get hurt.

1071
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:16,036
- Got it?
- This guy just won't do.

1072
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:17,161
What?

1073
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:22,458
So, what are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

1074
00:58:26,617 --> 00:58:27,951
That was unexpected.

1075
00:58:28,945 --> 00:58:32,003
Why is he... What? Why?

1076
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:45,992
- Hey.
- Yes?

1077
00:58:46,018 --> 00:58:47,420
Why don't we go talk?

1078
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,585
Come here.

1079
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:51,407
Why are you doing this?
Please don't do this.

1080
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:53,175
Let's talk briefly.

1081
00:58:53,175 --> 00:58:55,635
Don't do this. Please don't do this.

1082
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:08,224
Get over here.

1083
00:59:09,175 --> 00:59:11,253
Please save me. Save me.

1084
00:59:11,253 --> 00:59:12,476
Excuse me, please.

1085
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:36,963
Excuse me, excuse me.

1086
00:59:36,963 --> 00:59:40,215
I'm here for an interview.
My name is Kang Seo Jin.

1087
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:44,358
Please wait. Some weird man
is inside causing a commotion.

1088
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:47,744
Let me go. It hurts.

1089
00:59:47,744 --> 00:59:48,965
Sir, please!

1090
00:59:50,025 --> 00:59:51,217
Oh gosh.

1091
00:59:58,512 --> 00:59:59,722
Oh my.

1092
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:09,275
Sorry about that.

1093
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:20,134
What kind of person does that?

1094
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,523
Do you know him, by chance?

1095
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:24,563
What?

1096
01:00:25,757 --> 01:00:28,847
- No.
- You said you're Kang Seo Jin?

1097
01:00:28,847 --> 01:00:30,201
- Yes.
- You're a bit late.

1098
01:00:30,201 --> 01:00:31,516
I'm sorry.

1099
01:00:31,516 --> 01:00:34,557
Director, we have one more interviewee.
What should we do?

1100
01:00:34,557 --> 01:00:37,126
We should see her. Come in.

1101
01:00:37,126 --> 01:00:38,429
Thank you.

1102
01:00:48,806 --> 01:00:50,219
<i>This is it.</i>

1103
01:00:50,931 --> 01:00:53,581
<i>I can't bear it any longer.</i>

1104
01:00:54,139 --> 01:00:58,402
<i>But I can't say I give up first.</i>

1105
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:02,199
<i>What do I do now?</i>

1106
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:17,987
Where did it go?

1107
01:01:17,987 --> 01:01:19,771
What? What? What?

1108
01:01:19,771 --> 01:01:23,911
I made a radar. It disappeared.

1109
01:01:25,653 --> 01:01:27,322
I can't do it any longer, then.

1110
01:01:27,322 --> 01:01:30,043
What? You can't do it without that radar?

1111
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:32,485
Of course, an aircraft carrier
without a radar

1112
01:01:32,485 --> 01:01:34,889
is like a guest house without guests.

1113
01:01:35,965 --> 01:01:38,170
I really wanted to complete it.

1114
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,443
Now there is no meaning
behind building it.

1115
01:01:42,943 --> 01:01:45,181
Maybe you're sitting on it.

1116
01:01:47,157 --> 01:01:48,266
No, I'm not.

1117
01:01:49,148 --> 01:01:52,106
You never know. Stand up.

1118
01:01:54,942 --> 01:01:56,391
Okay.

1119
01:01:56,391 --> 01:01:58,878
I can stand up.

1120
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:08,914
What? It's not there.

1121
01:02:08,914 --> 01:02:11,005
I told you it's not there.

1122
01:02:12,942 --> 01:02:16,385
I really wanted to complete it.
I'll be going now then.

1123
01:02:17,213 --> 01:02:20,813
Does it make sense for
the radar to disappear, Doo Shik?

1124
01:02:20,813 --> 01:02:23,684
Gosh, how shocking.

1125
01:02:23,684 --> 01:02:25,873
It's seriously so upsetting.

1126
01:02:25,873 --> 01:02:28,576
I'm so upset.
How could we lose the radar?

1127
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:33,159
Seriously, I don't think
I'll even be able to sleep.

1128
01:02:36,782 --> 01:02:40,032
I'm so concerned
that I don't think I can do it.

1129
01:02:40,034 --> 01:02:41,076
Why?

1130
01:02:41,076 --> 01:02:44,405
I'm worried about Dong Gu.

1131
01:02:44,405 --> 01:02:47,686
I'm okay because
I've been trained for this.

1132
01:02:47,686 --> 01:02:52,085
One can get quite traumatized if they
lose a radar while building these models.

1133
01:02:52,085 --> 01:02:53,831
It can get quite bad.

1134
01:02:53,831 --> 01:02:55,806
- Really?
- Oh yes.

1135
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:59,077
You don't know...

1136
01:02:59,788 --> 01:03:01,423
how that feels.

1137
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:03,885
It can be so terrible.

1138
01:03:03,885 --> 01:03:06,322
Dong Gu, are you okay?

1139
01:03:06,322 --> 01:03:08,481
You're very shocked, right? Dong Gu.

1140
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:10,090
Dong Gu, are you okay?

1141
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,998
You're upset about the radar, right?

1142
01:03:34,251 --> 01:03:37,505
What are you doing?
Does it taste good alone?

1143
01:03:37,505 --> 01:03:40,021
I told you to rest at home
after the interview.

1144
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:41,588
Why did you come here?

1145
01:03:41,588 --> 01:03:42,751
Just because.

1146
01:03:44,548 --> 01:03:46,518
Here. Give me some too.

1147
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:51,074
Did your interview go well?

1148
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,213
You didn't make a mistake?

1149
01:03:52,213 --> 01:03:53,846
Yes, I did well.

1150
01:03:54,563 --> 01:03:57,005
But what did you about
your filming schedule today?

1151
01:03:57,005 --> 01:03:58,061
Huh?

1152
01:03:59,284 --> 01:04:03,431
Oh... I just quit.

1153
01:04:03,431 --> 01:04:04,467
Yeah.

1154
01:04:05,697 --> 01:04:07,976
Was that because of me?

1155
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:10,898
No, it wasn't. Not at all.

1156
01:04:10,898 --> 01:04:14,626
My image is very intelligent and smart.

1157
01:04:14,628 --> 01:04:17,260
The elite prosecutor was perfect for me.

1158
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:20,878
The gangster role didn't suit me at all.

1159
01:04:23,465 --> 01:04:24,610
Anyway...

1160
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:27,789
thanks so much for today.

1161
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:29,809
No need to be cheesy
and thank me.

1162
01:04:30,552 --> 01:04:33,271
Never mind that. Let's just drink.

1163
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:53,960
Why are you drinking
alcohol like it's water?

1164
01:04:57,121 --> 01:05:02,539
Today, you made feel a tiny bit

1165
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:04,360
touched by what you did.

1166
01:05:06,228 --> 01:05:08,672
Touched? No need for that.

1167
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:13,231
Like you said,
it was a very important interview.

1168
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:14,951
It was an important interview.

1169
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:17,891
You said it was your last interview.

1170
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,394
So...

1171
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,411
you should pass and get the job.

1172
01:05:24,411 --> 01:05:25,728
All right, girl?

1173
01:05:25,728 --> 01:05:27,155
Okay, I will.

1174
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:30,005
If I get the job

1175
01:05:30,005 --> 01:05:34,807
I will get you an eyebrow tattoo.

1176
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:36,710
A really pretty one.

1177
01:05:39,373 --> 01:05:40,827
Thank you.

1178
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:45,927
But, I don't want a tattoo.

1179
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:49,510
How about you give me those
right here as a gift?

1180
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:50,902
Hey, you.

1181
01:05:50,902 --> 01:05:52,188
Why, you...

1182
01:05:52,188 --> 01:05:55,393
It's a joke. It's just a joke.

1183
01:05:57,534 --> 01:06:01,443
You know when I saw you earlier?

1184
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:05,400
My heart was racing, you know.

1185
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:08,864
Why do you think it did that?

1186
01:06:09,954 --> 01:06:11,822
Am I crazy?

1187
01:06:15,302 --> 01:06:18,068
Hey, what are you doing?

1188
01:06:18,068 --> 01:06:20,427
Hey, just let me look at you.

1189
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:21,889
- What?
- You punk.

1190
01:06:28,597 --> 01:06:31,695
I don't understand it.

1191
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:35,483
What is attractive about this guy?

1192
