1
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:13,520
Well done guys. See you tomorrow.

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:15,265
- Thank you. - Sung Bin!

3
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,075
- Can you look over here? - Sung Bin!

4
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:30,005
Excuse me.

5
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:31,930
Yes?

6
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,315
Can you...

7
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:38,055
take a picture of me and Sung Bin?

8
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:41,825
Sure.

9
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,655
I'm ready.

10
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:50,535
1, 2, 3.

11
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:54,135
Thanks.

12
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:08,285
Jun Ki. let's go watch a movie this weekend.

13
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:10,110
The movie you wanted to watch was released.

14
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:12,455
And it's been a while since we've gone out on a date.

15
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:14,125
Okay.

16
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,495
What's wrong? Are you all right?

17
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,955
It's just that...

18
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:22,220
I thought people would recognize me...

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,235
and that I'd have fans after the drama aired.

20
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:27,450
But nothing's different.

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,605
You'll have fans soon.

22
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:32,575
Will that day really come?

23
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:34,945
We're home!

24
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:37,315
- Have you been grocery shopping? - Yes.

25
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:40,930
You two look like newlyweds.

26
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,370
Gosh, we don't. That's too much.

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,140
I know. You shouldn't say that.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,880
Gosh, you two look so happy.

29
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:53,795
Wait, is Dong Gu Sol's dad now?

30
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,665
Sol's father.

31
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:00,720
No, I can't be her dad.

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,290
- You went too far. - He did.

33
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,690
Jun Ki, don't say that.

34
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,445
Gosh. I'm so envious.

35
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:10,670
- What's that by the way? - Right.

36
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:14,400
This was delivered to Jun Ki, but it doesn't say who it's from.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,785
Really?

38
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:17,385
I wonder who sent this.

39
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,580
What... What's this?

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,225
(I love you, Jun Ki.)

41
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,765
What is it? Oh gosh!

42
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:33,020
What's that? Is that blood?

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,250
(I love you.)

44
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,975
Gosh, it seems like it.

45
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:42,270
- Hello? - Jun Ki.

46
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:46,215
Did you receive the presents I sent you?

47
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,085
"Presents"?

48
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:52,915
Do you mean...

49
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,880
Who are you?

50
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,095
It's me, Jin Joo.

51
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:01,090
Don't you know who I am?

52
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:02,565
"Jin Joo"?

53
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:04,950
I've never heard of your name before.

54
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,335
What?

55
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:10,975
How can you... How can you not know me?

56
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:15,105
I always think about you and watch you all the time.

57
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,845
You can't do this to me!

58
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,770
- What's this? - What was it about? Who is it?

59
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,840
I think it's the person who sent me these.

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,140
- What? - What?

61
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,295
She knows your number too?

62
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:34,050
- Maybe she's your stalker. - Stalker?

63
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,880
You know, fans who are too obsessive.

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,520
Does that mean I have a fan?

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,235
This is not the time to be happy.

66
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:43,590
Jun Ki, before anything happens, we should report to the police.

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,190
We can't report to them about a petty thing like this. Don't.

68
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,190
Let's see.

69
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,560
She's my fan. She loves me.

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,130
- It's fine. - Hello? Is this the police station?

71
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,785
(Stalker)

72
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:57,240
Drive properly.

73
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:59,910
- You're really bad. - Gosh.

74
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:01,210
Fire in the hole.

75
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,940
- Be quick. - Gosh.

76
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,580
- Let's go! - Gosh.

77
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,450
Hey, you can't do this to me.

78
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,135
How can you throw a banana at a beginner?

79
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,235
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,805
I'm going! I did it!

81
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:19,975
I won!

82
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,145
You tricked me into talking to outrun me.

83
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,630
Hey, losers should keep quiet.

84
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,140
You lost. Cook some ramen.

85
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,270
You're such a cheap, stingy, mean cheater.

86
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,970
- Do you want to die? - Do you want eggs or not?

87
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,785
No, I'll just do as I do.

88
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:37,795
- Tell me if you want some, Seo Jin. - Sure.

89
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,495
Make some delicious ramen.

90
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:42,080
How can you make fun of him all the time?

91
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,535
I don't know, but it's really fun.

92
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,030
Hello?

93
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:52,175
All right. Sure.

94
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:53,660
What is it about?

95
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,145
Jun Ki's stalker was caught.

96
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:02,385
We tracked the caller's number and caught her at an Internet cafe.

97
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:05,855
I'm sorry, Jun Ki.

98
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,885
I just like you so much.

99
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:13,295
You're so handsome.

100
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:18,235
I had no bad intentions.

101
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:21,305
I mean it.

102
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,305
What do you want? Do you want her to be punished?

103
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:29,845
Gosh.

104
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,440
I'm letting it slide because you promised...

105
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,125
you'd never do it again, okay?

106
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:44,210
Okay.

107
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,220
Do you like me that much?

108
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:50,635
Yes, I really like you.

109
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:53,720
I became your fan the moment I saw you.

110
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,220
The gangster's minion in "Cold-blooded".

111
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,890
The radioactive mutant in "The City of Supermen".

112
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,490

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,760
The driver in "Gayageum in My Heart"﻿.

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,615
And Octopus Man in "Super Aqua Man".

115
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:07,700
I've seen all your works.

116
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,100
Really? All of them?

117
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,655
Of course.

118
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:14,340
I even have DVDs...

119
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,485
for every work you were in.

120
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:18,395
Even I don't.

121
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,595
You're amazing.

122
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,720
Your name is Jin Ju, right?

123
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,750
Jin Ju, when you want to see me, you can call me...

124
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,095
and come over.

125
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:28,390
My address is...

126
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,490
Huam-ro 31-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul.

127
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,575
Waikiki Guesthouse.

128
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:36,070
The room next to the bathroom on the first floor.

129
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:37,870
How do you know that?

130
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,275
That's not...

131
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:41,800
important, is it?

132
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,145
What?

133
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:45,210
All right.

134
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:48,225
Are you hungry? Do you want some tteokbokki?

135
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,425
Sure.

136
00:06:50,485 --> 00:06:51,680
Let's go.

137
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,065
I'm so happy.

138
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,765
Okay. Good job, Ah Young.

139
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,260
You must be busy with your work. Thank you for helping out.

140
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,905
Don't worry. I could use a little, extra cash.

141
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:11,430
Can I use the bathroom?

142
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,430
Sure. Give that to me.

143
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,315
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

144
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,755
Wait. What's this sound?

145
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:25,510
Du Shik, is it the sound of your heart beating?

146
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,855
What?

147
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,550
No, that's not true.

148
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,635
Yes, it is. Do you have a crush on Ah Young?

149
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:34,920
Ask her out if you want.

150
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
No. That's absurd.

151
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,675
My goodness.

152
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,160
Ah Young, Du Shik wants to take you to a movie.

153
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,515
- Hey, what are you doing? - What?

154
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:47,030
You do?

155
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,900
Sounds good. What should we watch?

156
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,485
Well...

157
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:53,015
Anything you want.

158
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:55,525
When should we go?

159
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:11,005
Mom. I'm here...

160
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:14,275
Gosh. Who are you?

161
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:16,645
Jin... Jin Ju.

162
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:18,830
What are you doing here?

163
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,740
You said I could come over anytime.

164
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:24,585
You looked so cute when you were sleeping,

165
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:26,510
so I've been watching you.

166
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,540
Since when?

167
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,480
Since around midnight.

168
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,095
Midnight?

169
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,395
I... I see.

170
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,535
I had no idea.

171
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:41,530
What's that?

172
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:43,190
What is this?

173
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,390
I hate to see you...

174
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,560
with someone else in pictures,

175
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,945
so I put pictures of me next to you.

176
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:57,285
Why?

177
00:08:58,185 --> 00:08:59,655
Do you not like it?

178
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,310
I... I do. I like it.

179
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,395
It looks good.

180
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:07,365
That's a relief.

181
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,480
What's the noise?

182
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,050
Gosh. Who are you?

183
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,050
Why do you need to know that?

184
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,220
Don't you see I'm talking to Jun Ki?

185
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,505
What?

186
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:34,040
Jun Ki, have breakfast with me.

187
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,325
I've prepared some food for you.

188
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,355
You've prepared breakfast for me?

189
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:42,025
Okay. I'll be right there.

190
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,165
Hurry up.

191
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:45,635
Okay.

192
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:50,990
What's going?

193
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,560
- Who is that creepy girl? - What do you...

194
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,530
Right? I was so scared...

195
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,715
that I pretended to be asleep. Who is she?

196
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,340
She's my fan.

197
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:02,845
The one who sent me the pictures yesterday.

198
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:05,640
She's that stalker?

199
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,710
She's not a stalker. She's a fan.

200
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,895
She likes me so much.

201
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:14,395
I'll go have breakfast with my fan.

202
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,650
- She's a stalker. - She's just a fan.

203
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,120
- She's... - Don't eat anything!

204
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,865
I'm scared of what will happen to him.

205
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,515
- Du Shik. - Oh, hi.

206
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:38,210
Ah Young, you look beautiful today.

207
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:39,340
Really?

208
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,910
I dressed up for you. Do you like it?

209
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,795
Yes. You look very pretty.

210
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:46,195
Thank you.

211
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,325
You look good too.

212
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,165
You seem to love sweatpants.

213
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:53,595
Yes. They're so comfortable.

214
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:55,020
I see.

215
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,860
You already bought popcorn and drinks?

216
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,330
That's so sweet.

217
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:02,105
Thank you. Should we go in?

218
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,140
The movie was great, right?

219
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,000
Should we go eat now?

220
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,370
Forget it. I'm just going to go home.

221
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,340
What? Why?

222
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,940
You really don't know?

223
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,925
I'm so disappointed in you.

224
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:19,755
What? Why?

225
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:23,065
What's wrong? Ah Young!

226
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,750
Sol, do you want to learn some words?

227
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,420
The first word you should learn is,

228
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,590
"Dad".

229
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,435
Okay?

230
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:36,745
Say, "Dad".

231
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:40,715
Sol, you need to focus when you're studying.

232
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:44,780
Try. "Dad".

233
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,970
"Dad".

234
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,325
Please say it just once.

235
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,250
What's wrong?

236
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,835
You were so excited about your date. What happened?

237
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,705
Well...

238
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,090
What?

239
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,490
She was suddenly angry after the movie and left?

240
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,730
Yes.

241
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,100
Think carefully. You must have done something wrong.

242
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,570
I didn't do anything wrong.

243
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:15,770
I got there 30 minutes before,

244
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,270
booked tickets for the movie she wanted to watch,

245
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,670
and even bought popcorn and drinks beforehand.

246
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,140
The movie was fun too.

247
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,610
But she suddenly got angry and left.

248
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,085
What could it be?

249
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,410
Did the popcorn taste bad?

250
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,510
No. She finished everything.

251
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,765
Really? Then what is it?

252
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:33,450
Is it because you bought regular coke instead of diet coke?

253
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,120
No. She even drank mine too.

254
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,405
Really?

255
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:41,560
Could it be that she just didn't like your face?

256
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,030
- What? - When I stare at your face,

257
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,900
I get annoyed.

258
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,485
- That doesn't make sense. - It does.

259
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:50,885
What did I do wrong?

260
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,815
Du Shik, let's play another game.

261
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:57,225
Why do you look so down? Did something happen?

262
00:12:58,055 --> 00:12:59,495
Well...

263
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:05,220
Gosh. It's no wonder Ah Young got angry.

264
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,750
Why?

265
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,560
What did I do wrong?

266
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:10,320
You really don't know?

267
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,690
You're not together yet,

268
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,005
but this was your first date. How could you wear sweatpants?

269
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:18,700
Sweatpants? What's wrong with them?

270
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,530
Hey, Ah Young must have...

271
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,400
dressed up for the date.

272
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,740
But you just threw on a pair of sweatpants?

273
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,070
Of course, she got angry.

274
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,425
I picked out the prettiest pair of sweatpants that I have.

275
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,125
Look at this.

276
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:33,080
- It's a frog. - Gosh.

277
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,550
- Why would she be angry? - Exactly. It looks good.

278
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,150
- It's super cute. - Right?

279
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,565
Gosh. You really don't understand girls.

280
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,760
Anyway, Ah Young is a sensitive type.

281
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,190
Be more careful.

282
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,445
Okay, I will.

283
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:55,785
- Sung Bin! - Sung Bin!

284
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,210
- Sung Bin! - Sung Bin!

285
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:00,555
- Please look over here! - Sung Bin!

286
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:04,395
- Please look over here! - Sung Bin!

287
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:06,655
Jun Ki!

288
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,925
(Milky-faced Lee Jun Ki)

289
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:14,290
Milky-faced Lee Jun Ki!

290
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:17,265
I love you, Jun Ki!

291
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,960
Jun Ki, you did a great job today.

292
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,300
Here's a drink for you.

293
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,470
This is a vitamin that will give you energy.

294
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,670
And a candy...

295
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,355
to maintain your blood sugar level.

296
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:34,780
Here.

297
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:38,025
Is this really for me?

298
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,650
You didn't have to.

299
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:42,220
Thank you.

300
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:45,435
Director, this is my fan.

301
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:47,095
You're a celebrity now.

302
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:49,660
Sung Bin.

303
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:51,575
This is my fan.

304
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:54,945
Sir, this is my fan.

305
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,475
Why did you want to see me?

306
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:02,500
Ah Young.

307
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,815
- I'm sorry about yesterday. - Sorry about what?

308
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:10,285
Yesterday, I was careless and wore sweatpants to the movies.

309
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:11,955
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,235
You know, after all.

311
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,260
I'm sorry for being thoughtless.

312
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:23,560
How about I buy you something delicious?

313
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:26,175
Do you want to go to a nearby cake place?

314
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:28,670
The cake is so delicious.

315
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:31,800
I was stressed out today, so I was craving sweets.

316
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,630
Why? Did something happen?

317
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,700
Something annoying happened at work today.

318
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,740
My senior kept making me do his work...

319
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,340
while he was procrastinating.

320
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,825
Really?

321
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:45,295
I was also annoyed by online-shopping customers.

322
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:47,980
They wanted a refund for the clothes that they tore.

323
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,620
- I couldn't believe it. - How could they do that?

324
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,090
It must have been hard.

325
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,335
It's okay. It always happens.

326
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:57,620
You finished your coffee. I'll get a refill.

327
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,435
It's okay. I'm leaving.

328
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:01,745
What?

329
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:04,800
What's wrong? Did I do something wrong?

330
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,515
Do you really not know?

331
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,040
- You're terrible. - What?

332
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:12,555
Wait, what did I do wrong? Ah Young.

333
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:14,740
What's wrong this time?

334
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,980
Gosh, no wonder she got upset.

335
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,250
Really?

336
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:20,910
What did I do wrong?

337
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,780
Ah Young said that something annoyed her at work.

338
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,650
Why did you talk about your problem?

339
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,360
What's wrong with that? Is that upsetting?

340
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:29,805
Why?

341
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:32,990
Ah Young wanted you to listen and side with her.

342
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,860
She wanted you to empathize with her.

343
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,300
You should have sided with her or consoled her.

344
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,375
Why didn't you listen to her?

345
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:43,085
Instead, you talked about yourself. Of course, it's upsetting.

346
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:45,415
Really?

347
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:48,285
I see.

348
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,695
- Good job. - Thank you.

349
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:54,865
Thank you. Goodbye.

350
00:16:58,065 --> 00:17:01,235
My goodness. They will be here today.

351
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:03,865
It's Jin Ju.

352
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:06,075
She must be here to see me.

353
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,045
Does she like me that much?

354
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,130
(You're mine, ASTAR.)

355
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,640
- Jin Ju. - Jun Ki.

356
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:16,640
Why did you come again?

357
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,755
Let's go. I'll buy you some coffee...

358
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:22,380
What's all this?

359
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:23,910
This?

360
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,310
It's an ASTAR fan club t-shirt.

361
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,380
This is A-Bulb for cheering.

362
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,260
I'm a fan of ASTAR.

363
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:32,935
"ASTAR".

364
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:37,165
Were you also a fan of other celebrities?

365
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,900
Among the actors, it's you. Among the singers,

366
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:41,445
it's ASTAR.

367
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:44,245
Is that so?

368
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:47,870
Aren't you going to watch my drama with me today?

369
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,500
I know. After ASTAR's performance,

370
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,715
- I'll be right there. - It's ASTAR!

371
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,330
There we go. It's done.

372
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:14,375
This should be enough.

373
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,715
The drama will be aired soon. Where's Jin Ju?

374
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:21,670
What are all these? They look delicious.

375
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,770
- Hey. - That hurt.

376
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,000
How dare you touch it?

377
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,110
I'll eat these with Jin Ju while watching the drama.

378
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,340
Did you prepare snacks for that stalker?

379
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,055
She's not a stalker. She's my fan.

380
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:36,865
Why isn't she here yet?

381
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:39,890
Jun Ki.

383
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,805
(Do Min Ho Pizza)

384
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,845
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

385
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:51,875
What happened?

386
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:54,415
The drama is over. Why isn't she here yet?

387
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:56,285
She isn't picking up either.

388
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:58,455
Did something happen?

389
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:04,710
The phone is turned off.

390
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,910
- Please leave a message... - What?

391
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,765
I could call her just now. Why is her phone off?

392
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:13,135
Is she...

393
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,405
avoiding my calls?

394
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:19,075
No, that can't be.

395
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,545
It can't be.

396
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:23,405
No way.

397
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,495
Jun Ki, what brings you here?

398
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,565
We were supposed to watch my drama yesterday.

399
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:45,320
But you didn't come, and I couldn't contact you.

400
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,595
I was wondering if something was wrong.

401
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:51,660
How did you know where I lived?

402
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,035
What?

403
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,805
That's not what's important.

404
00:19:58,245 --> 00:19:59,670
Why didn't you come yesterday?

405
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:03,485
ASTAR's performance finished late.

406
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,555
I see.

407
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:09,450
Did you watch my drama yesterday?

408
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,880
No, I was too tired.

409
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,650
I fell asleep.

410
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,165
I see.

411
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,625
That could happen.

412
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:22,005
I downloaded the drama. Do you want to watch it with me?

413
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:23,705
Sure.

414
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:26,475
I'll come to your house later.

415
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:30,345
Will you? Okay. I'll wait for you at home.

416
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:31,875
Okay.

417
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:39,840
Ah Young, I'm sorry about yesterday.

418
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,280
Sorry about what?

419
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:44,850
You said that something annoyed you at work.

420
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:47,595
I didn't listen to you and only talked about myself.

421
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:51,850
You know, after all. Do you know how disappointed I was yesterday?

422
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,530
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

423
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,120
I'll be careful from now on.

424
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,505
Okay.

425
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,530
You aren't upset anymore, right?

426
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,860
What shall we do? What do you want to do?

427
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,260
Forget it. I'm leaving.

428
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,040
You're terrible.

429
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:06,630
Why?

430
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,470
Did I do something wrong again?

431
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,900
Don't you know?

432
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,480
How could you come without thinking what to do?

433
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:16,025
- Isn't it polite to make plans? - What?

434
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:20,695
I'm sorry. I was thoughtless.

435
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:23,320
Since the weather is nice,

436
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,850
shall we walk in the park?

437
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,320
Cherry blossoms have bloomed.

438
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,650
Forget it. I'm leaving.

439
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,660
You're so terrible.

440
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,990
Why? Why?

441
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,375
What did I do wrong?

442
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:36,860
Can't you see that I'm wearing heels?

443
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,430
Are you suggesting that we go to a park?

444
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,600
Do you want my feet to hurt?

445
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,385
Right. I'm sorry.

446
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:45,355
I was thoughtless.

447
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:48,240
Shall we go get some coffee?

448
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
Why not?

449
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,510
Okay, let's go.

450
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,795
(Twinkle, twinkle ASTAR)

451
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:02,160
Jin Ju, where are you?

452
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:03,420
Why aren't you coming?

453
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,730
We were going to watch my drama together.

454
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:07,875
It's him again.

455
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:09,745
Why does he keep doing this?

456
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:13,015
Where are you? Are you on your way?

457
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:15,500
Jin Ju, why aren't you answering?

458
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,645
Why aren't you responding after reading?

459
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,510
He's so persistent.

460
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:22,610
(Jun Ki)

461
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,285
I don't care anymore.

462
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:29,225
Why aren't you picking up?

463
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:32,150
Jun Ki, how did you get here?

464
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,105
That's not what's important.

465
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,265
What are you doing here?

466
00:22:37,935 --> 00:22:39,730
Are you here to see ASTAR again?

467
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:43,530
Is this why you broke your promise?

468
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,975
What? No.

469
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:48,785
I forgot.

470
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:51,415
I was about to go.

471
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:52,955
Really?

472
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:55,325
It's true, right?

473
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:57,525
Then shall we go?

474
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,265
I got a present for you.

475
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:08,805
- Ta-da. - What is it?

476
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:12,135
This is...

477
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:14,275
Jun Ki's shirt.

478
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:20,575
This is a cheering stick for Jun Ki.

479
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:30,425
Why? Do you not like it?

480
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:34,920
I do. I really like it.

481
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:37,425
My goodness.

482
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:40,935
Great.

483
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:43,305
Jun Ki's stick.

484
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:46,075
Gosh.

485
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,760
Do you call yourself a journalist?

486
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,315
There's me. Look.

487
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:57,545
Jin Ju.

488
00:23:58,285 --> 00:23:59,710
What are you doing?

489
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:02,180
Pardon? What's wrong?

490
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:04,485
Why aren't you waving my stick?

491
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:07,595
You were waving at ASTAR.

492
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:11,065
I was about to wave it.

493
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:19,575
What? Are you yawning?

494
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:22,005
Are you sleepy already?

495
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:25,815
You were cheering for ASTAR until late at night.

496
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:29,245
I didn't yawn.

497
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:32,715
I was impressed by your acting.

498
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:35,685
That's it, right?

499
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,195
Look, I'm on again.

500
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:50,490
Come on. What are you doing back there?

501
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,990
- Du Shik. - Go easy on me.

502
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,175
There's no going easy.

503
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:58,515
Okay, I shoot.

504
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,810
I got first place, didn't I?

505
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,445
I got first place.

506
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:07,310
I'm leaving.

507
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:08,640
You're so terrible.

508
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,250
I get it.

509
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:11,725
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

510
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:13,855
I made a mistake again.

511
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:15,220
I'm sorry.

512
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:18,120
To make it up to you, I'll cook you noodles.

513
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,635
Let's go.

514
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,305
- All right. - Let's go.

515
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:28,460
Soo Ah. When did you get here?

516
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,505
What? Just now.

517
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:33,015
- What's that? - What?

518
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,310
It's just a game.

519
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:38,185
It was just released. I thought I'd play it with you.

520
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:41,710
Let's play it some other time. I have to eat noodles with Ah Young.

521
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,625
- Sure. All right. - Let's go.

522
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:45,225
Enjoy.

523
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:50,325
I can always play by myself.

524
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:01,905
It's more fun when there are 2 players than 1.

525
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,490
Soo Ah. Soo Ah. Soo Ah.

526
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,015
- Soo Ah. - Yes?

527
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,830
Du Shik. Let's play this game together.

528
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,340
Wait. Wait a minute.

529
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,700
Let's play another time.

530
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,015
I have something I need to ask you.

531
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,180
Me? What is it?

532
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:16,585
You see,

533
00:26:17,185 --> 00:26:19,810
I want to ask Ah Young to be my girlfriend.

534
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,595
How should I do it?

535
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:24,150
What? You're going to confess?

536
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,750
I think I'll mess up again if I do this on my own,

537
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,080
so I wanted to ask you.

538
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,820
How do girls want guys to confess?

539
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,990
- How would I know? - Wait. I need your help.

540
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,360
Give me some advice. Please, Soo Ah?

541
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,945
I don't know.

542
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:44,785
Actually, there is one way.

543
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,910
What shall we have for lunch today?

544
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:49,580
How about spaghetti or maybe Chinese food for a change?

545
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:50,985
Ah Young.

546
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:55,050
Du Shik. What brings you here?

547
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,765
Why are you dressed like that?

548
00:27:04,495 --> 00:27:07,375
I have something to ask you.

549
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:09,245
What is it?

550
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:34,795
What do you think you're doing?

551
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:11,165
Ah Young.

552
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:14,275
Will you be my girlfriend?

553
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:22,440
Du Shik. What are you doing?

554
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:23,845
What's the matter?

555
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,555
Is it because you're so moved?

556
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:29,725
Then is today the first day...

557
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:38,520
Ah Young. Ah Young. What's the matter?

558
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,335
Did I do something wrong again?

559
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:55,200
Where are you? Why haven't I heard from you?

560
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,885
You've gone to see ASTAR again, haven't you?

561
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,655
What's wrong with this guy?

562
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:03,285
He's a complete stalker.

563
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,820
Jun... Jun Ki.

564
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,005
I see you've come home, my dear Jin Ju.

565
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:21,375
- How did you get in here? - What?

566
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:26,015
That's not what's important.

567
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,170
It's not, is it?

568
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,355
You haven't been answering my calls these days.

569
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:34,515
I came over because I was worried,

570
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:36,625
but I see...

571
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:38,595
you're doing well.

572
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:42,080
I've been busy these days.

573
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,495
Is that right? Then I guess you weren't able to see my drama.

574
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:47,235
Shall we...

575
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:49,505
watch the relays of the episodes?

576
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:51,735
- Right now? - Why?

577
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:56,005
(Don't take your eyes off me.)

578
00:29:56,205 --> 00:29:57,605
Do you not want to?

579
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,715
Excuse me?

580
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,045
How am I a stalker?

581
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:03,700
I didn't stalk her.

582
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,670
Jin Ju's my first fan,

583
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,555
so I did it because I was so happy.

584
00:30:07,815 --> 00:30:10,825
I had no bad intentions.

585
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:12,650
Jin Ju.

586
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:14,320
You know how I feel, right?

587
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:15,765
So...

588
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,480
- would you like him punished? - Yes.

589
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,235
Yes, she wants... What?

590
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,535
Jin Ju.

591
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:25,690
Gosh. You had nothing better to do than...

592
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,430
stalk your stalker? Then you got a restraining order?

593
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,460
I didn't stalk her.

594
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,090
It was affection toward my fan.

595
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,415
My goodness.

596
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,540
You made such a big deal out of it.

597
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:38,955
You ended up losing your only fan.

598
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:44,755
- Gosh. - My goodness.

599
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:46,795
He's upset. I'm sure of it.

600
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,265
He sure has a bad temper.

601
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:57,690
Where were you two while being dressed like that?

602
00:30:57,695 --> 00:30:59,175
Soo Ah!

603
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,345
How do you plan on explaining this?

604
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:05,775
What's wrong? What is it this time?

605
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:16,585
What? You confessed to her in public while tap dancing?

606
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:19,895
On top of that, you did it in front of her colleagues?

607
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:21,440
Are you crazy?

608
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,565
Don't you know girls hate when guys confess in public?

609
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:26,935
Really?

610
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:28,490
Soo Ah.

611
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,120
You told me it would work.

612
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,975
You said girls love it when guys do that!

613
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:36,070
That's strange.

614
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:38,530
I love it when guys confess in public.

615
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,930
I guess other girls don't like it.

616
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,340
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

617
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:44,845
Is that all you have to say?

618
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:46,510
What are you going to do about this?

619
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:48,640
You take care of this. Take care of this!

620
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,725
I said I'm sorry.

621
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:54,295
I'm tired. I'm going to get some rest.

622
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,350
Where do you think you're going? Where are you going?

623
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,595
Come back here this instant! Hey!

624
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:09,260
- Yoon Ah. - Oh my goodness!

625
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,800
- Go away. Go away. - Gosh.

626
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,230
Oh, dear. Dong Gu. Are you all right?

627
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,940
I'm sorry. It's just that I was so startled.

628
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:17,845
No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have startled you.

629
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:20,140
I'm late, aren't I?

630
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,940
The meeting ran late.

631
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,285
It's all right. I just got here after getting out of class.

632
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:26,795
Shall we go?

633
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:30,580
The weather's still quite chilly.

634
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,150
Aren't your hands cold?

635
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,920
What? No, I'm all right.

636
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,305
I don't think so. They look awfully cold.

637
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:38,935
Would you like me to warm them up for you?

638
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:41,975
I'm the type that has really warm hands.

639
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:45,745
You know I'm not doing this just to hold your hand, right?

640
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,415
All right.

641
00:32:58,415 --> 00:33:00,780
Ah Young. Ah Young. Listen to me.

642
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,080
About that tap dance... Ah Young. Wait.

643
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,425
Gosh.

644
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:05,935
Soo Ah!

645
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:08,590
This is all your fault. Do you know that?

646
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,965
I said I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

647
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:14,520
I wonder why Ah Young doesn't like tap dancing. I love it.

648
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,860
What? Who cares if you like it?

649
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,815
Hey. Come back here. Hey!

650
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:22,685
I'm home.

651
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:26,115
Welcome home.

652
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:28,780
Why is it so hard to see you these days?

653
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:29,980
I'm sorry.

654
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:32,120
I've been busy shooting scenes.

655
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,250
I know. I know, but...

656
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:36,150
do you know how long it's been since we've gone on a date?

657
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,565
I'm sorry.

658
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:41,290
Then shall we go out to see a movie right now?

659
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:43,720
No. You'll pass out while watching a movie.

660
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,135
Let's go some other time.

661
00:33:45,705 --> 00:33:47,275
I'm really sorry.

662
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:50,430
Then since my shoot ends early tomorrow,

663
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,930
shall we see a movie and come home together?

664
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,015
I'll make time for you no matter what.

665
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:57,585
Really? You mean it? You promised.

666
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:59,715
- I promise. - You promised.

667
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:11,580
I'm tired. I'm so exhausted.

668
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,835
How could the shooting last all night every single day?

669
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:17,505
This is killing me.

670
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:19,175
It must be tough.

671
00:34:19,235 --> 00:34:22,945
But I'm lucky to be able to pursue my acting career.

672
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:27,215
It's physically tough, but I'm truly happy these days.

673
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:32,710
Hello, losers.

674
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:34,140
What's gotten into this sorehead?

675
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,110
Are you manic today?

676
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,140
Where were you?

677
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,255
I'm on my way back from a romantic date with Yoon Ah.

678
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:44,520
I see you can't stop smiling because you're so happy.

679
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:48,235
Have you made any moves yet?

680
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:50,965
I'm assuming you two have kissed, right?

681
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:54,635
What? Kiss?

682
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:58,260
We already kissed at the wedding, remember?

683
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,330
Do you call that a kiss? That was a peck.

684
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,515
Don't you know the difference between a kiss and a peck?

685
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:05,885
From the way I see it, you two haven't kissed yet, right?

686
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:08,510
- Did you hold hands? - Of course!

687
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:11,270
We hold hands every day. We hold them really hard!

688
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,210
Good for you.

689
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,910
That's great.

690
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,150
You should hold her hand forever.

691
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,650
Well, you can't measure love...

692
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,420
with physical affection, you pervert.

693
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,020
Sure, sure.

694
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,760
You should hold your hands and be in love forever then.

695
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,135
Wait.

696
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:32,075
Does that mean you've kissed Seo Jin?

697
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:38,130
Do you think you're a shrimp or something? Get up!

698
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,570
Did you kiss my sister or not?

699
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,325
Get up! Get up!

700
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:49,080
You're awake.

701
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,450
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

702
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,710
What are you doing?

703
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,795
It's spring now, so I'm seasoning vegetables for some side dishes.

704
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:57,165
It looks delicious.

705
00:35:58,395 --> 00:36:01,635
Yoon Ah, you have something on your lips.

706
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:04,345
It must have gotten there when I was tasting it.

707
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,415
Gosh, I'll take it off for you.

708
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:11,485
It's soft.

709
00:36:11,615 --> 00:36:13,255
It's too soft.

710
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,940
It feels soft on my fingers.

711
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,555
It will be softer when my lips touch it.

712
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:20,510
Dong Gu, what's wrong?

713
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,125
I want to kiss her.

714
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:25,265
I want to kiss her.

715
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:27,695
Dong Gu, are you all right?

716
00:36:27,995 --> 00:36:30,320
What? I... Yes.

717
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,235
I was distracted for a moment.

718
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:36,445
I'm going to the office.

719
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:38,205
Sure.

720
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:42,600
Now, we have Shin Hyun Joon,

721
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,670
and it's possible to hide the air rifle in the bread.

722
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,810
The protagonist has to meet with the Arabian spy,

723
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,010
Shin Hyun Joon.

724
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:55,450
Would there be a unique way for them to check their identities?

725
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:59,435
They could send signals by touching their glasses.

726
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:01,260
That's too boring.

727
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:03,605
Don't you have any new ideas?

728
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:06,460
He's doing that again.

729
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,900
He must have an idea.

730
00:37:07,905 --> 00:37:09,605
What would it be this time?

731
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:13,215
- Kiss! - Kiss?

732
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:17,385
Make them kiss to send signals?

733
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:19,410
That's new.

734
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:20,855
Director!

735
00:37:21,285 --> 00:37:23,410
This is too much.

736
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,470
What do you mean?

737
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,610
It's new, sexy, and great.

738
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,465
Sir, I can't do this anymore.

739
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:33,795
- What's wrong? - I'm going to quit.

740
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:39,060
I... Sir.

741
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,675
Sir.

742
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:43,800
It must be hard for you to have shootings every day.

743
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,305
I'm fine.

744
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,715
I'm just happy to get the chance to act.

745
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:51,370
Do you have a management team?

746
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,540
- No, not yet. - Really?

747
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,440
So do you manage your schedules and your styling all by yourself?

748
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,540
Yes.

749
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,810
You should have a management team...

750
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,055
so you can focus on acting.

751
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:06,650
Right. Then should I try telling my boss about you?

752
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,705
What? Do you mean...

753
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,705
YS?

754
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:16,305
It's a huge company. I can't be a part of that.

755
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:19,130
I'll try to arrange a meeting for you.

756
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,830
You should talk to my boss.

757
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,245
Really?

758
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:25,285
Thank you. Thank you!

759
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:29,525
- I must get going. I'm busy. - Thank you.

760
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:31,685
Thank you.

761
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:35,340
YS. Gosh.

762
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,950
Jun Ki, you're here.

763
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:39,920
The writer sent me the revised script.

764
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,620
- The revised script? - Yes, an important scene was added.

765
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,435
- Look at scene 38 first. - Scene 38?

766
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:50,360
Jun Seok. He finds his position to be similar...

767
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,870
to that of Elizabeth inside the show window.

768
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,885
He cries while staring at Elizabeth.

769
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:58,510
Elizabeth?

770
00:38:58,515 --> 00:39:00,455
But who is Elizabeth?

771
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:05,355
A turtle?

772
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:07,255
That's Elizabeth.

773
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:11,280
What? The turtle is called Elizabeth?

774
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,720
Yes, you'll be getting a turtle from this episode.

775
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,520
What? Why so suddenly?

776
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,550
The writer wanted to show...

777
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,800
the hard situation Song Jun Seok is in...

778
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:24,700
by comparing it to the hard shell of the turtle.

779
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:27,600
He heals his wounds by taking care of the turtle...

780
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,340
and shares his feelings with it.

781
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:30,845
Share his feelings?

782
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:33,955
With Elizabeth... With a turtle?

783
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:36,625
We don't have much time. Let's go.

784
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:43,865
Elizabeth... A turtle...

785
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:48,360
Song Jun Seok has enemies everywhere.

786
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:51,520
While going back home, he sees Elizabeth,

787
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,330
locked in the water tank and surrounded by walls.

788
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,275
Then he cries without realizing it.

789
00:39:56,535 --> 00:39:58,005
Do you understand?

790
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,800
Yes. I'll try.

791
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,385
Okay. Then we'll start filming.

792
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:07,155
We're going now.

793
00:40:11,715 --> 00:40:14,395
Okay, get ready. Cue.

794
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:37,215
Cut. Jun Ki, what are you doing?

795
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:38,970
You're supposed to cry.

796
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,855
Well, I...

797
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:45,920
I can't concentrate on my acting when I see the turtle.

798
00:40:45,925 --> 00:40:49,155
Then what are you going to do? This is an important scene.

799
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:52,480
Listen. Stare into Elizabeth's eyes...

800
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,635
and connect with it.

801
00:40:56,235 --> 00:41:00,290
But the turtle's eyes are so small.

802
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,275
Just... Just try.

803
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:06,030
- We'll try again. - Sure.

804
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,615
Okay, get ready. Cue.

805
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:21,055
Cut! Again!

806
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:24,765
Cut.

807
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,665
Cut. Gosh.

808
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,690
Connect! Connect!

809
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:33,105
All right. Connect. Connect.

810
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:36,660
Cut. Cut.

811
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,890
- Cut! - What?

812
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,575
- What's wrong with you today? - Right.

813
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:54,855
Is Shin Hyun Joon really going to be in your movie as an Arabian?

814
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:58,595
I want to kiss her.

815
00:41:58,695 --> 00:42:00,235
I want to kiss her.

816
00:42:01,765 --> 00:42:03,235
Dong Gu.

817
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:05,835
Dong Gu, can't you hear me?

818
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:07,260
What?

819
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,805
No, I was listening.

820
00:42:11,305 --> 00:42:12,960
Right. Yoon Ah,

821
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,110
I wanted to talk to you about something.

822
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:17,985
Really? What is it?

823
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:22,215
It's very important. It's not something I should be saying here.

824
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:26,125
Do you want to talk over there?

825
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,325
All right.

826
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:29,965
Let's go.

827
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:32,995
What do you want to tell me?

828
00:42:33,565 --> 00:42:37,765
Well, I'm having a hard time with the movie...

829
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:40,805
and the low earnings from the house.

830
00:42:41,465 --> 00:42:43,605
So I need something...

831
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:46,075
to keep me going in life.

832
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:49,045
Really?

833
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:51,845
Cheer up, Dong Gu.

834
00:42:53,685 --> 00:42:55,115
But...

835
00:42:56,015 --> 00:42:58,440
hearing those words...

836
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,595
won't really cheer me up.

837
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:03,865
Really? Then what should I do?

838
00:43:06,825 --> 00:43:08,920
- Can you... - Sorry?

839
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,690
- Can you...just once? - What?

840
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,590
Can you just kiss me once?

841
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,305
What? Kiss?

842
00:43:17,905 --> 00:43:20,715
So was all of this about kissing?

843
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,375
No,

844
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,710
it isn't because I want to kiss you.

845
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:28,555
I just really need something to cheer me up.

846
00:43:34,955 --> 00:43:36,365
All right.

847
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:39,565
Really?

848
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:42,165
Yes.

849
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:06,495
What should I do?

850
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:10,025
What's wrong?

851
00:44:10,255 --> 00:44:12,990
I'm sorry. I'm...

852
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:15,665
very ticklish.

853
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:18,420
You must have a sensitive neck.

854
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,175
Let me try again.

855
00:44:35,445 --> 00:44:37,225
Are you ticklish on your sides too?

856
00:44:37,315 --> 00:44:38,580
Okay.

857
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,995
Let me try again.

858
00:44:48,665 --> 00:44:50,290
It tickles so much.

859
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,705
What should I do? It tickles.

860
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,400
Ah Young is ignoring my calls and messages too now.

861
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,470
What should I do?

862
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,470
Give up now.

863
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:08,080
No. I can't give up.

864
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:10,310
I think we're meant to be together.

865
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,325
You say that about a different girl every day.

866
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:18,190
Ah Young.

867
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:19,735
I'm back.

868
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:23,150
You're home early.

869
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,490
Do you want to go see a movie?

870
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,935
I dressed up for our date. What do you think?

871
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:32,160
Bacca, I'm sorry,

872
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,470
but I don't think I can go see a movie today either.

873
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:38,715
What? Why?

874
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:41,755
Well...

875
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,220
So...

876
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:50,065
you have to find a way to connect with this turtle?

877
00:45:50,595 --> 00:45:51,965
Yes.

878
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:55,420
How are you supposed to do that?

879
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:56,935
I don't know either.

880
00:45:57,195 --> 00:45:59,050
Anyway,

881
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,100
the director wants me to eat and sleep with this turtle.

882
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:03,060
We have to stay together at all times.

883
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,300
What?

884
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:08,675
Seo Jin, can we go see a movie some other time?

885
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:10,770
You've been saying that so many times.

886
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,410
How can you do this to me?

887
00:46:12,415 --> 00:46:13,915
I'm sorry.

888
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:16,610
We'll go see a movie tomorrow instead, okay?

889
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,070
I'll treat you to some nice food too.

890
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,080
Let's go to the restaurant you've been talking about.

891
00:46:21,085 --> 00:46:22,420
Are you sure?

892
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:24,650
Keep your promise this time.

893
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,395
Okay.

894
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,765
By the way, how should I connect with this turtle?

895
00:46:39,035 --> 00:46:40,445
Elizabeth,

896
00:46:40,475 --> 00:46:42,460
look me in the eye.

897
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,545
Let's open up and communicate.

898
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:48,785
Are you serious?

899
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:52,650
Elizabeth, where do you come from?

900
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:54,780
Do you have any friends? What about siblings?

901
00:46:54,785 --> 00:46:57,665
What's your motto? What's your favorite book?

902
00:46:58,795 --> 00:47:00,980
Gosh. Of course, it doesn't understand.

903
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,835
What was I expecting?

904
00:47:02,895 --> 00:47:04,605
This is driving me crazy.

905
00:47:07,335 --> 00:47:08,705
You're back.

906
00:47:10,435 --> 00:47:11,930
Why do you look so troubled?

907
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,600
It's nothing.

908
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:15,100
What's that turtle?

909
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,045
What? Well...

910
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:18,945
I don't want to talk about it.

911
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:21,915
Jun Ki.

912
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:24,450
I have a question.

913
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:27,910
The main character in the movie I'm preparing has a girlfriend.

914
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,380
- And? - And...

915
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,780
this main character has to kiss his girlfriend.

916
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,550
However, she's so ticklish.

917
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,720
It's impossible to kiss her.

918
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,120
- So? - What should he do...

919
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,875
to kiss his girlfriend?

920
00:47:42,205 --> 00:47:43,290
So...

921
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,830
you can't kiss Yoon Ah because she's too ticklish?

922
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,030
Yes.

923
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,500
I can't even touch her.

924
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,930
No!

925
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm talking about the movie!

926
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,715
Who are you trying to fool?

927
00:47:55,245 --> 00:47:56,940
What should I do?

928
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,240
Do you have any ideas?

929
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,295
It's no problem.

930
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:01,610
If she's ticklish,

931
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,480
don't use your hands.

932
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,750
Kiss her without using my hands? How?

933
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,760
Put your hands behind your back.

934
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,205
Hands behind my back?

935
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:22,530
Come on. That would look weird.

936
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,770
You think so?

937
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,340
Why don't you hold her by the hair? She can't be ticklish on her hair.

938
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,040
Hold her by the hair?

939
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,640
That would look even worse.

940
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,010
It's not romantic at all.

941
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,480
But you can at least kiss her.

942
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
Just forget it!

943
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,480
I'd rather not kiss her.

944
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,680
It's not like I'm obsessed with kissing.

945
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,420
I can't believe you.

946
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:41,865
What about now? It doesn't tickle, does it?

947
00:48:42,365 --> 00:48:44,160
Are you saying...

948
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:46,260
you're going to kiss me like this?

949
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,460
We have no choice.

950
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,730
You're too ticklish.

951
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,390
Also, like I said,

952
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,815
it's not that I want to kiss you.

953
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:55,430
I just need some energy.

954
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:58,185
Fine, I get it.

955
00:49:14,595 --> 00:49:17,065
What's wrong? I didn't even touch you.

956
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:18,520
That's not it.

957
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,635
Your breath tickles too much.

958
00:49:21,735 --> 00:49:23,345
"My breath"?

959
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:26,475
Don't you think you're too sensitive?

960
00:49:26,775 --> 00:49:29,630
I'm sorry. I tried to ignore it,

961
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,100
but I just can't.

962
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,740
All right. I'll hold my breath.

963
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,285
Let's try again, okay?

964
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,750
I can't do this.

965
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,935
What should I do? It tickles so much.

966
00:49:51,165 --> 00:49:52,920
I'm sorry.

967
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,305
It just tickles so much.

968
00:50:06,245 --> 00:50:08,785
Elizabeth, does it taste good?

969
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:13,225
Tell me what you think. Come on.

970
00:50:14,355 --> 00:50:15,780
Are you serious?

971
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,810
I took a bath with you, let you sleep on my arm, and fed you.

972
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,180
Isn't it time you started to listen to me?

973
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,350
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

974
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,490
That's enough.

975
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,050
You're starting to look like a crazy person.

976
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,360
- What? - He is crazy.

977
00:50:27,365 --> 00:50:28,775
Leave him alone.

978
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,630
How dare you?

979
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,790
It's not like I want to do this myself.

980
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,860
Do you know what kind of scene I'll be shooting with her?

981
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,175
What is it?

982
00:50:36,975 --> 00:50:39,170
You know the movie, "Days of Being Wild", right?

983
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,200
Do you remember the scene where Leslie Cheung dances?

984
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,110
I have to do that with Elizabeth while looking into its eyes.

985
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,110
- What? - You have to dance with a turtle?

986
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,520
Yes.

987
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:52,865
The writer drew 10 stars to say the scene is super important.

988
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:54,880
I feel so sorry for you.

989
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,365
You never run out of problems. Seriously.

990
00:50:59,065 --> 00:51:00,320
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

991
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,690
Don't forget about our date tonight.

992
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,090
Keep your promise this time, okay?

993
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,290
Don't worry.

994
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,630
I've even booked a restaurant.

995
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,975
Really?

996
00:51:09,105 --> 00:51:10,915
We haven't been on a date in such a long time.

997
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:13,515
Gosh, we're eating here.

998

(Culture Department)

999
00:51:20,885 --> 00:51:23,925
I'm so excited about our date tonight.

1000
00:51:25,695 --> 00:51:28,235
Should I have put on something prettier?

1001
00:51:33,065 --> 00:51:34,935
I better finish this up soon.

1002
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,475
Seo Jin.

1003
00:51:37,735 --> 00:51:39,960
Go through these papers and make a summary...

1004
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,000
by tonight.

1005
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,230
Sorry? All of these?

1006
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,440
Yes.

1007
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,185
What? You don't want to?

1008
00:51:46,215 --> 00:51:48,300
Well, that's not what I mean.

1009
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,655
No matter what happens, it has to be done by tonight, okay?

1010
00:51:55,225 --> 00:51:56,850
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1011
00:51:56,855 --> 00:51:59,050
I can't finish this today.

1012
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:00,820
I'm going on a date with Jun Ki.

1013
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,395
This is driving me crazy. Seriously.

1014
00:52:03,835 --> 00:52:05,265
Gosh.

1015
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:09,945
What should I do? I better hurry.

1016
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:15,600
Have you been able to connect with Elizabeth?

1017
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,840
Sorry?

1018
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:19,445
Well, I've tried my best.

1019
00:52:19,815 --> 00:52:21,070
All right.

1020
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,040
Song Jun Seok loses his anchor position.

1021
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,970
To deal with the pain,

1022
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,255
he does a mambo dance with Elizabeth.

1023
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:31,010
- Okay. - However,

1024
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,010
how well you dance isn't important.

1025
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,330
The viewers should be able to see the connection between you two.

1026
00:52:36,335 --> 00:52:37,690
Do you understand?

1027
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:39,105
Yes.

1028
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:42,190
Elizabeth, let's do this. Please.

1029
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,900
Okay. Then let's start right away.

1030
00:52:44,905 --> 00:52:46,875
Let's start!

1031
00:52:53,415 --> 00:52:55,215
Relax your face.

1032
00:52:59,685 --> 00:53:01,295
Ready.

1033
00:53:02,025 --> 00:53:03,425
Cue!

1034
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:35,355
Cut!

1035
00:53:35,385 --> 00:53:36,750
What are you doing?

1036
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,050
Elizabeth is running away.

1037
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,250
I'm sorry.

1038
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,080
Try to connect with her.

1039
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,635
Okay. I'm sorry.

1040
00:53:44,695 --> 00:53:46,365
Let me try again.

1041
00:53:50,075 --> 00:53:53,445
Elizabeth, what's with you?

1042
00:53:53,845 --> 00:53:56,330
Do me a favor, will you?

1043
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:59,400
Let's start from where you begin to dance together.

1044
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,015
Okay.

1045
00:54:01,915 --> 00:54:03,725
Do a good job, Elizabeth.

1046
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:06,255
Ready. Action.

1047
00:54:09,995 --> 00:54:11,450

Elizabeth is running away.

1049
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,935
- I'll try one more time. - Connect enough before starting.

1050
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,705
Okay.

1051
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,635
Ready. Action.

1052
00:54:24,835 --> 00:54:26,245
Cut.

1053
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,675
Cut.

1054
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:29,445
Cut.

1055
00:54:29,545 --> 00:54:30,985
Cut.

1056
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:33,455
Cut!

("Newsroom" Episode 3)

1058
00:54:37,085 --> 00:54:39,885
Elizabeth.

1059
00:54:40,825 --> 00:54:44,250
Will you shoot this scene all day?

1060
00:54:44,255 --> 00:54:47,320
We've had over 10,000 cuts.

1061
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,620
I'm sorry, Director.

1062
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:52,005
I gave you a day. Why can't you communicate?

1063
00:54:52,065 --> 00:54:53,575
Also...

1064
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:55,220
What will you do?

1065
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,230
Elizabeth went under her shell.

1066
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,270
- What will you do? - Pardon?

1067
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:02,230
What can I do when she hid herself?

1068
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,245
You're the closest to her.

1069
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:07,670
Comfort her and make her come out.

1070
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,055
Pardon me?

1071
00:55:09,285 --> 00:55:11,385
How can I do that?

1072
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:12,770
I don't know anymore.

1073
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:15,425
Let's take a break until she comes out.

1074
00:55:15,655 --> 00:55:18,825
I can't believe that I'm having this problem.

1075
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:20,865
I'm sorry.

1076
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:24,605
This is driving me crazy.

1077

Elizabeth, please come out.

1080
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,815
What's wrong with her?

1081
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:45,225
Come out, please?

1082
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:55,295
Okay. I'm finished.

1083
00:55:59,135 --> 00:56:01,835
Here you go. I'm done.

1084
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:04,390
- Did you finish all? It was a lot. - Yes.

1085
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,490
Did you really do it thoroughly?

1086
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:09,060
I did. I didn't eat lunch or take bathroom breaks.

1087
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,845
I worked very hard to finish it.

1088
00:56:13,915 --> 00:56:16,515
- Good job. You may go. - Okay.

1089
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:18,285
See you tomorrow.

1090
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:22,195
Gosh, I'm tired.

1091
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:27,135
Why is she always out to get me?

1092
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:31,330
I'm happy thinking about going on a date...

1093
00:56:31,335 --> 00:56:33,235
with Jun Ki.

1094
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:37,105
Why hasn't he called yet?

1095
00:56:41,605 --> 00:56:45,515
Will you keep acting like this, Elizabeth?

1096

Come out.

1097
00:56:48,345 --> 00:56:50,755
Elizabeth.

1098
00:57:01,365 --> 00:57:02,650
Hello, Seo Jin.

1099
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,235
Where are you? I'm here.

1100
00:57:05,495 --> 00:57:07,335
Well,

1101
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:10,570
I'm still on set.

1102
00:57:10,575 --> 00:57:13,860
What? Why are you still there?

1103
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,315
I only have one scene left,

1104
00:57:16,445 --> 00:57:19,710
but the shoot is getting postponed because of Elizabeth.

1105
00:57:19,715 --> 00:57:21,700
Could you wait a little?

1106
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,725
I'll finish as quickly as possible.

1107
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:25,770
Okay.

1108
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,495
- Come soon. - I will.

1109
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:30,565
I'm sorry.

1110
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:35,720
Did you hear that, Elizabeth?

1111
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,905
Seo Jin is already waiting.

1112
00:57:39,265 --> 00:57:42,275
Please help me.

1113
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:45,305
Come on, Elizabeth.

1114
00:57:45,335 --> 00:57:48,945
If you keep doing this, I have another plan.

1115
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:52,305
Come on, Elizabeth.

1116
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:55,942
If you keep doing this, I have another plan.

1117
00:58:00,113 --> 00:58:01,981
Turtle, turtle.

1118
00:58:02,248 --> 00:58:04,117
Show me your head.

1119
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:07,187
If you don't come out,

1120
00:58:07,854 --> 00:58:10,356
I'll grill and eat you.

1121
00:58:14,394 --> 00:58:16,229
My goodness.

1122
00:58:16,229 --> 00:58:18,498
When will I get to leave?

1123
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:28,908
Elizabeth, you're finally out.

1124
00:58:30,276 --> 00:58:32,011
Did it work?

1125
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:35,482
Thank you for coming out, Elizabeth.

1126
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:37,584
Goodness.

1127
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:40,053
What is it?

1128
00:58:40,653 --> 00:58:44,023
Did you understand what I said?

1129
00:58:44,023 --> 00:58:45,992
What?

1130
00:58:47,127 --> 00:58:49,696
Did we communicate...

1131
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:51,364
successfully?

1132
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,068
Elizabeth.

1133
00:58:57,604 --> 00:59:00,073
It really works.

1134
00:59:00,273 --> 00:59:02,675
Gosh, Elizabeth.

1135
00:59:03,443 --> 00:59:05,011
Thank you.

1136
00:59:06,946 --> 00:59:09,883
Ready. Action.

1137
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:38,211
Cut. Okay, that was great.

1138
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:41,815
I could totally see you communicate with Elizabeth.

1139
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:44,984
Good job, Jun Ki. That was impressive.

1140
00:59:44,984 --> 00:59:46,853
Thank you, thank you.

1141
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:51,558
I won't forget this, Elizabeth.

1142
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:52,826
Thank you.

1143
00:59:56,696 --> 01:00:00,233
Right. I'll be leaving, Director.

1144
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:01,534
Okay, go.

1145
01:00:01,534 --> 01:00:04,704
Thank you, everyone.

1146
01:00:14,514 --> 01:00:17,050
Why are you giggling about?

1147
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:20,420
I just came back from seeing Ah Young.

1148
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,488
I don't think she's upset anymore.

1149
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:25,124
- Really? - Yes.

1150
01:00:25,124 --> 01:00:27,460
I'm calling to ask her out on a date.

1151
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,562
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

1152
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:31,030
Please leave a message...

1153
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,532
Why isn't she picking up?

1154
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:37,437
The phone is turned off.

1155
01:00:37,437 --> 01:00:39,606
Please leave a message after the beep.

1156
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:41,808
Extra fees will be charged after the connection.

1157
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,176
Why is her phone off?

1158
01:00:44,077 --> 01:00:45,578
I could call her just now.

1159
01:00:46,145 --> 01:00:49,649
She's obviously avoiding your call.

1160
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:51,417
Please leave a message after the beep.

1161
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:53,419
- Why? - Don't you get it?

1162
01:00:53,419 --> 01:00:55,555
She's still upset.

1163
01:00:56,155 --> 01:00:57,223
No way.

1164
01:00:57,223 --> 01:00:59,893
I asked her if she was upset.

1165
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:02,629
She said, "No, I'm not upset."

1166
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:05,498
I asked her if she was okay.

1167
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:08,368
She said, "Yes, I'm fine now."

1168
01:01:08,368 --> 01:01:09,936
You're so silly.

1169
01:01:09,936 --> 01:01:12,572
- She doesn't mean that she's okay. - What do you mean?

1170
01:01:12,572 --> 01:01:15,241
When she says that she's not upset,

1171
01:01:15,241 --> 01:01:17,277
it means that she's furious.

1172
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:19,779
When she says that she's fine,

1173
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:22,782
it means that she's not okay and that she's hurt.

1174
01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:24,517
- That's what it means. - What?

1175
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:28,655
When she says that she's not upset, it means that she is.

1176
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:31,391
When she says that she's okay, it means that she's not?

1177
01:01:31,391 --> 01:01:33,793
- Yes. - Why would you say the opposite?

1178
01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:38,498
You have no idea how women feel.

1179
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:40,433
- Is she being sarcastic? - Yoon Ah.

1180
01:01:40,433 --> 01:01:41,834
Where's Yoon Ah?

1181
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:43,970
- I think she's on the third floor. - Really?

1182
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:46,773
What's wrong with him?

1183
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:49,742
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah.

1184
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:53,479
I finally found it.

1185
01:01:53,546 --> 01:01:54,981
What did you find?

1186
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:56,449
The way we can kiss.

1187
01:01:57,517 --> 01:01:59,185
Are you talking about kiss again?

1188
01:02:00,253 --> 01:02:02,155
I told you.

1189
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:04,691
It's not because I want to kiss you.

1190
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:08,094
I just need some energy.

1191
01:02:09,696 --> 01:02:12,465
Okay, so what's the solution?

1192
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,777
What do you think?

1193
01:02:24,777 --> 01:02:27,613
You wouldn't be tickled by my breath, right?

1194
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:33,019
Is this really necessary?

1195
01:02:33,052 --> 01:02:36,255
As I told you,

1196
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:39,058
it's not because I want to kiss you.

1197
01:02:40,393 --> 01:02:43,129
I feel down, so I need energy.

1198
01:02:43,129 --> 01:02:44,364
Forget it.

1199
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:48,501
This is our first kiss. Where's the ambiance?

1200
01:02:48,534 --> 01:02:50,436
Aren't you being harsh?

1201
01:02:56,509 --> 01:02:57,744
I'm sorry.

1202
01:02:58,244 --> 01:03:00,546
I couldn't find any other solution.

1203
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:03,383
Was I being too childish?

1204
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:05,551
I'm sorry, Yoon Ah.

1205
01:03:07,186 --> 01:03:09,722
Why are you so silly?

1206
01:03:09,722 --> 01:03:11,858
Pardon? Silly?

1207
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:15,061
You don't get ticklish, do you?

1208
01:03:15,928 --> 01:03:18,064
- I don't. - Then everything is fine.

1209
01:03:48,294 --> 01:03:49,962
We could just do this.

1210
01:03:52,298 --> 01:03:55,334
From now on, if you want to kiss, tell me.

1211
01:03:55,668 --> 01:03:57,136
I'll kiss you.

1212
01:03:57,503 --> 01:03:58,604
What?

1213
01:03:59,238 --> 01:04:01,074
All right.

1214
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:04,243
Then I'll be going downstairs now.

1215
01:04:05,144 --> 01:04:06,312
All right.

1216
01:04:15,988 --> 01:04:18,858
One more time. One more time. One more time.

1217
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:21,127
I'm late. I should hurry.

1218
01:04:21,394 --> 01:04:23,863
I'm sure Seo Jin's really upset. I better take a taxi.

1219
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,632
Jun Ki. You've finished your scenes, right?

1220
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:27,700
Yes, just now.

1221
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:29,135
Is something wrong?

1222
01:04:29,135 --> 01:04:30,670
Remember I mentioned before that...

1223
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,171
I'd introduce you to my CEO sometime?

1224
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:34,507
He's in the area taking care of some business,

1225
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:35,775
and he said he wants to meet you.

1226
01:04:36,776 --> 01:04:38,111
Right now?

1227
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:39,745
I told him good things about you,

1228
01:04:39,745 --> 01:04:43,015
so if you leave a good impression, you'll be able to sign a contract.

1229
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,218
Really?

1230
01:04:47,153 --> 01:04:49,055
Why? What's the matter?

1231
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:53,960
You see, I'm supposed to meet my girlfriend right now.

1232
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,094
What?

1233
01:04:56,028 --> 01:04:58,464
Have you lost your mind?

1234
01:04:58,464 --> 01:05:00,433
Opportunities like this don't come along every day.

1235
01:05:00,433 --> 01:05:02,368
That I know, of course,

1236
01:05:02,935 --> 01:05:05,938
but you see, my girlfriends been waiting for me for hours.

1237
01:05:06,339 --> 01:05:08,207
I'm really sorry,

1238
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:10,710
but could I possibly meet with him another day?

1239
01:05:10,743 --> 01:05:13,112
Is a date with a girl more important than your acting career?

1240
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:14,814
If you miss this opportunity, do you actually think you'll ever...

1241
01:05:14,814 --> 01:05:17,483
be able to sign a contract with a major agency like ours?

1242
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:21,621
You say you want to become an actor, but you don't seem desperate.

1243
01:05:22,321 --> 01:05:24,390
It's up to you. Do whatever you want.

1244
01:05:45,077 --> 01:05:46,245
(Jun Ki)

1245
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:52,385
Jun Ki. Are you done?

1246
01:05:52,385 --> 01:05:54,187
Yes. I just finished.

1247
01:05:54,554 --> 01:05:57,256
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry,

1248
01:05:57,523 --> 01:06:00,059
but I don't think I'll be able to make it today.

1249
01:06:00,326 --> 01:06:02,261
What? Why not?

1250
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:06,165
You see, there's an agency I really want to sign with.

1251
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:09,468
The CEO said he wants to meet with me right now.

1252
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:11,204
What?

1253
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:13,539
So?

1254
01:06:13,673 --> 01:06:15,908
I'm really, really sorry,

1255
01:06:16,342 --> 01:06:19,412
but do you mind if we have a meal together another day?

1256
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:26,419
I'm truly sorry, but...

1257
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:28,421
it's just that this is a really important opportunity for me.

1258
01:06:28,588 --> 01:06:32,491
Can you be understanding just this one time?

1259
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,294
All right.

1260
01:06:35,428 --> 01:06:37,430
Really? Really?

1261
01:06:37,763 --> 01:06:39,632
You're not upset, are you?

1262
01:06:39,765 --> 01:06:41,867
No, I'm not upset.

1263
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:44,337
You're not lying, are you? Are you really okay?

1264
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:46,038
I'm fine. Really.

1265
01:06:46,806 --> 01:06:49,075
Thank you Seo Jin. I appreciate it.

1266
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:51,210
Then I'll see you at home later.

1267
01:07:00,653 --> 01:07:01,954
I'm all right.

1268
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:05,458
Really.

1269
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:08,861
I'm really all right.

1270
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:44,530
(Welcome to Waikiki)
