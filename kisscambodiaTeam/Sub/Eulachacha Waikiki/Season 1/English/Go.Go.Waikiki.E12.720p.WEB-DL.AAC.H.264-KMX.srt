3
00:00:10,784 --> 00:00:14,544
I see you as a man, Joon Ki.
What should I do?

4
00:00:14,544 --> 00:00:16,792
Hey, of course I'm a man.
Then, am I a woman?

5
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:18,312
Not in that way...

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,445
I think I like you, Joon Ki.

7
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:26,943
- What?
- I said I like you, Joon Ki.

8
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,484
Why are you suddenly being this way?

9
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:36,375
Come here. Are you sick?

10
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,143
You seem fine.

11
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:41,694
There must be a hidden camera.
Did you plan this with the others?

12
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:44,139
Now that you're dating a PD,
you've begun acting.

13
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:46,485
I really like you, Joon Ki.

14
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:51,119
What?

15
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:53,716
You mean it?

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,368
You like me?

17
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:59,225
You and me?

18
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,530
I'll ask you one more time.

19
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,905
To you, Joon Ki...

20
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:07,025
am I not a woman?

21
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,441
Why are you doing this, huh?

22
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,545
How could I see you like that?
You're like my little sister.

23
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:14,060
I've known you since you were this little
and you know how our relationship is.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,197
Oh, stop it. Stop that now.

25
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:23,358
Okay.

26
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:27,953
I understand what
you're saying, so leave.

27
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,647
Why are you being so scary?

28
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,245
- I said leave.
- Hm?

29
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,546
- I said leave!
- Hey, Seo Jin.

30
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:38,069
- Seo Jin.
- I said get out!

31
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,177
Seo Jin, open the door.

32
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:43,399
Talk to me. Hey, Kang Seo Jin.

33
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,066
What's going on?

34
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:48,816
Why are you knocking on
my little sister's door?

35
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:51,246
I told you to stay away from her.

36
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:54,058
- It's not like that.
- Get over here! Come on.

37
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:57,129
It's not like that. Hey!

38
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:02,537
Yeah, why should I feel bad?

39
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,043
He's always getting himself into trouble.

40
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,914
He's just a no-name actor.

41
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:26,385
<i>[I Am a Woman Too]</i>

42
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:29,468
<i>Do I know Goni?</i>

43
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,075
<i>He's the best card shark I know.</i>

44
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:35,582
"Do I know Goni?"

45
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:38,173
"He's the best card shark I know."

46
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:42,074
Oh, I am such a Kim Hye Soo wannabe.

47
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:45,492
I need to live a cool life like her.

48
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:49,342
Yeah, she's so cool,
even from a female perspective.

49
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,162
I'm home.

50
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:54,667
You're home? Doo Shik,
why are you home so late? I waited.

51
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,366
For me? Why?
Do you have something to say?

52
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,526
Yes. Remember what you said?

53
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:01,961
That I should find
what makes me happy forever.

54
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,418
So, I thought about it.

55
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:06,319
I have good looks,
I can sing, and I can dance, right?

56
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,765
No, so what are you going to be?

57
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:11,157
- An idol.
- What? An idol?

58
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,237
An idol at 29 years old?

59
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:16,891
At your age? Are you insane?

60
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:20,290
Hey! Well, is that too hard?

61
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,542
Then what should I do?

62
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:26,461
Wasn't there something you
thought of since you were young?

63
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,084
There is something.

64
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:32,824
I wanted to go to college
and learn fashion design.

65
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,548
But how can I take
entrance exams at this age?

66
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,924
Why can't you? Haven't you seen the news?

67
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:40,644
There are seniors who are nearly 70
who go to college.

68
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:41,993
Then should I do it too?

69
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:44,996
Sure, I'll help you study.

70
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:46,998
- You?
- Yes, him.

71
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:49,586
Hey, Doo Shik was an excellent student.

72
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:52,395
He's a writer who's good
at everything except writing.

73
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:54,474
- Shut up.
- Yes, Writer.

74
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:57,616
- But you really have to work hard.
- Okay.

75
00:03:57,616 --> 00:03:59,847
All right. Thank you, Doo Shik.

76
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,844
I'm home.

77
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,925
You're home, Seo Jin?
Have you eaten?

78
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:09,355
I don't feel like eating. I'm going up.

79
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:12,437
Oh, is something wrong with Seo Jin?

80
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:15,121
She's looked down these past few days.

81
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:18,209
Why did you want to come to
the bookstore this morning?

82
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,577
Huh? Well, you need books to read
for the college entrance exam.

83
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:28,379
First, I need to know your level,
so we should do a simple test.

84
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,790
Let's start with history.

85
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,646
He is the second son of Yeongjo
and father of Jeongjo.

86
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:37,209
He was named Crown Prince
by orders of Yeongjo.

87
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,838
The name of the crown prince who died
a tragic death by Yeongjo's command is...

88
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:42,298
- I know this.
- Oh.

89
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,310
- I saw the movie too.
- Good.

90
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,302
- Hint, hint.
- Hint, okay.

91
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,946
- A wooden rice chest.
- Wooden rice chest?

92
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,043
Oh, I know it. Yoo Ah In.

93
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,588
Yoo Ah In... that's not it.

94
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,196
- It's the crown prince.
- Exactly.

95
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:55,836
"Yoo Ah In." Three syllables.
("Syllable" sounds like "crown prince.")

96
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,766
No, which crown prince?

97
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,646
Yes, Yoo Ah In. It's three syllables.

98
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:03,483
He even does this...
"How absurd."

99
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:08,028
No, that's from the film "Veteran."

100
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:09,877
The answer is Crown Prince Sado.

101
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,687
Crown Prince Sado?

102
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,718
So that's why the film was called "Sado."

103
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:20,983
I thought it was about buying something.
("Sado" means "to buy.")

104
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:26,860
It's okay. You can always study again.

105
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,129
So, don't be down on yourself.

106
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,341
Thank you.

107
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,971
I feel better with you saying
these optimistic things.

108
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:35,391
Itâ€™s best to be optimistic
about everything.

109
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:37,821
So, don't worry. You can do it.

110
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,889
Okay. I can do it!

111
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:48,752
I haven't been home or showered in days.

112
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,004
What is this?

113
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,413
Speaking of...

114
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,485
I can't even remember
when I last saw Yoon Ah's face.

115
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,182
Goodness.

116
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:12,774
Hey, Kang Dong Gu.

117
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:15,317
Did you find everything
for the locations?

118
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:17,533
Yes. Here you go.

119
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:20,120
Wow, you found a lot.

120
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,869
You must've been up all night. Good work.

121
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:25,699
I think you need to stay up all night
today too. What can we do?

122
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,776
There's no choice.

123
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:30,040
Leave for a bit and go to the sauna.

124
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,057
You only have one hour.

125
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,812
One hour?

126
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,509
Su Ah, do you want to read this?
Can you do it?

127
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:42,189
Ah, of course.

128
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,978
What do you take me for?

129
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:46,894
- I'm starting.
- Okay.

130
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,468
Hi, Jan-ay. Do you--

131
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:51,896
It's not "Jan-ay." It's Jane.

132
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:55,956
Right, right. It's Jane. I'll go again.

133
00:06:55,956 --> 00:07:01,572
Hi, Jane. Do you want some pin-ay...

134
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,286
Pin-ay...

135
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:06,951
Pineapple.

136
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,341
Ah, right. Pineapple.

137
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,610
I was mistaken for a moment.

138
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,985
My misty.

139
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:13,973
It's not "misty."

140
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,759
- Mistake.
- Huh?

141
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:19,163
I was talking about the drama.

142
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:21,783
Don't you know the one with Kim Nam Joo?

143
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:23,360
It's my fabric drama.

144
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,737
"Fabric" is cloth.

145
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,221
- You probably meant favorite.
- Ah...

146
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:30,783
I see.

147
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,538
Sorry, English is a weak spot for me.

148
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,754
No, it's just been a long time,
so don't worry too much.

149
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,103
Thanks, Doo Shik. I'll try again.

150
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:41,894
<i>Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah!</i>

151
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,533
<i>Yoon Ah!</i>

152
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,033
What's with him?

153
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,610
Dong Gu, it's been a while.

154
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,261
- Are you off work?
- Be quiet. Where's Yoon Ah?

155
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,021
I'm sure she's in the house somewhere.
Why do you need to see her?

156
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:55,261
Oh, I need to ask her something.

157
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:58,610
I don't even have time.
Is she on the third floor?

158
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,875
Who is it? Oh no.

159
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,380
Yes, Director.

160
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,300
Here? I'm in the sauna. Yes, the sauna.

161
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,541
Yes, I'm putting on my underwear.
I'm putting my right foot in now.

162
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,040
Yes, I'm on my way now.

163
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,720
Geez.

164
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,954
What's wrong with him?

165
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,350
Was someone here?
It sounded like Dong Gu.

166
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,012
Yes, but he left right away.
He said he wanted to ask you something.

167
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,678
Me?

168
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:29,464
What could it be?

169
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:37,793
Why am I so nervous
when I've done so many auditions?

170
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:41,472
I really want to get this one.

171
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:48,219
Should I get some strength from my fans?

172
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,336
There are no comments at all.

173
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:54,365
Joonki_love, are you very busy?

174
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:58,476
- Come on in.
- Yes.

175
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,547
Joon Ki, don't be nervous.
You can do it!

176
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:05,029
You can do well, right? Yes, okay.

177
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,177
Should the media cover up issues?

178
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:13,246
Should the media distort the truth
and provoke the people?

179
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:16,360
The media neither hides
nor distorts the truth.

180
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,442
We need news so that the weak
are feared and so those with power fear.

181
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:25,498
That is the duty and life of a reporter.

182
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,301
Do you understand?

183
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:34,140
That is all.

184
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,566
Good job.

185
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,245
Yes.

186
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:46,879
Thank you for allowing me
to audition for you.

187
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:52,097
Do you like bean sprout stew?

188
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:53,327
Pardon me?

189
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:55,674
I do like it.

190
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:58,524
Then why don't we go eat some
and discuss the role?

191
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:01,394
What? What do you mean?

192
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,085
I like your acting.

193
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,533
We were actually looking for a new face.

194
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,025

What, what? What are you doing?

- Congrats, Joon Ki.
- Thank you.

- Oh, Dong Gu.

- Dong Gu.

Make sure it's a hit!

Good luck, Joon Ki!

207
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:13,876
- Thanks, I'll work really hard.
- Okay!

208
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:19,052
Get up. What are you doing?

209
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:24,101

- Lee Joon Ki!
- Thank you.

- Thank you.
- Lee Joon Ki!

Lee Joon Ki!

213
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,248
It's the director.

214
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:42,667
Yes, Director. Yes, I'm in front of
Announcer Park Chang Ho's house.

215
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,413
Thank you for the opportunity
to interview him.

216
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:49,921
I'll learn a lot from him. Yes.

217
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,808
How exciting.

218
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:56,183
The day has come when I get to
interview Park Chang Ho.

219
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,883
Wow.

220
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,541
<i>[Park Chang Ho]</i>

221
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,970
This is a nice place.

222
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,884
Madam, here you go.

223
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:13,710
Thank you.

224
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,216
What would he like for lunch?

225
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:25,633
He doesn't want anything
because of the interview.

226
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,673
You really suffered.

227
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:32,085
Go on and have your vitamins,
then lie down for a bit.

228
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,283
Thank you, Madam.

229
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:35,649
Oh my!

230
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,436
- You may go in.
- All right.

231
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:51,017
Oh, if he happens to look for me...

232
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:55,176
please tell him I'm not home
and that I'm out.

233
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:58,610
Please do me that favor.

234
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,664
Yes.

235
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:04,231
That she is out?

236
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,383
Excuse me.

237
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,596
Sir. Hello.

238
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:22,907
I am actor Lee Joon Ki,
who is supposed to interview you today.

239
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:26,168
Oh, you're here. One moment.

240
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:31,682
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

241
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:33,912
It's a true honor to meet you.

242
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:36,980
I hope I'm not interrupting you
when you are busy.

243
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,995
Not at all.

244
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:42,701
The drama is about the world of
announcers, so of course I wish to help.

245
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,770
- Please sit.
- Yes.

246
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,831
You must be writing something.

247
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,345
Yes, it's my autobiography.

248
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,702
I was organizing my manuscript.

249
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,888
I am thinking of printing 20 volumes.

250
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,841
20 volumes?

251
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:06,552
I suppose you have a lot to say since
you were an announcer for so long.

252
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:10,341
I tried to edit it down,
but it's still long.

253
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:13,600
Should we start the interview now?

254
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:18,902
What was your motivation
to become an announcer?

255
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:23,522
Motivation? What motivated me?

256
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:27,451
It was about 1987 back then.

257
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,543
It was snowing that day.

258
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:32,706
It was either December 11
or going on to December 12.

259
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:39,907
Anyway, our home was a rare building
that was a mix of Japanese and US wood.

260
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:42,508
- I see.
- It had two rooms.

261
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,332
One room was for my mom,
dad, me, and my little brother.

262
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:47,775
Also, our dogs
Boksil and Teunsil were there.

263
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:51,475
My oldest, second oldest, and third
oldest sister were in the other room.

264
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,226
My family influenced me greatly.

265
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,015
I should start with my oldest sister.

266
00:14:57,015 --> 00:15:02,392
She was tall for that time at 170
centimeters and thin at 48 kilograms.

267
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:06,139
<i>Wait. Why is he telling me this?</i>

268
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,907
<i>Strange.</i>

269
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:14,321
She's working hard.

270
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:15,765
Su Ah.

271
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,566
Su Ah. Drink this while you work.

272
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:23,434
- Should I see how much you did?
- Hm?

273
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:26,605
- No, no.
- Why? You're afraid you got some wrong?

274
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:28,625
It's okay. Let me see.

275
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,725
It's okay. Give it to me. It's okay.

276
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:38,298
You didn't solve any.

277
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:40,899
What did you do all this time?

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,628
<i>[Gangnam Station, Exit Four]</i>

279
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:45,115
I was reminded of the past.

280
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:47,885
I used to doodle like this a lot
in my books before.

281
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:50,745
I was going to finish this and study.

282
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:53,820
It's okay. I used to do this
a lot too before.

283
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,057
You can finish it.

284
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:58,206
Thanks. I'll finish it soon.

<i>So, my oldest sister who enjoyed eating
mung bean pancakes and kimchi pancakes</i>

286
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:06,736
met my brother-in-law who
researched flour at a flour company.

287
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:10,885
They got married fall of 1973
and had one daughter and one son.

288
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:14,149
They now live in Pennsylvania in a house
three blocks from the post office.

289
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,846
They live happily in a house
with a red roof.

290
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:18,192
Ah, I see.

291
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:21,595
Now, I will tell you about
my second oldest sister.

292
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:25,426
She is 162 centimeters tall
and weighs 50 kilograms.

293
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:27,124
She has an egg-shaped face.

294
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:30,965
She was a very wise young woman.

295
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:34,509
Her hobby was knitting and...

296
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:37,765
Joon Ki.

297
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,557
Joon Ki!

298
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:41,836
Yes? What?

299
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,684
Oh, Sir. I'm so sorry.

300
00:16:46,684 --> 00:16:50,066
I was practicing yesterday
and didn't get much sleep.

301
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,341
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

302
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:53,912
That can happen.

303
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:58,905
Sleep is an action that happens
without one consciously aware of it.

304
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:01,635
Sleep. Sleep, you say.

305
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:03,467
To understand sleep...

306
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:06,375
you will need to understand
Freud's psychoanalysis.

307
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,935
You need to know more about
Freud to understand this.

308
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:11,359
Freud's full name was Sigmund Freud

309
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,789
and he was born in
the Czech Republic in 1856.

310
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,505
His father was Jacob Freud...

311
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,420
Yoon Ah.

312
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,108
Oh, Dong Gu.

313
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,308
What are you doing here?

314
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:52,185
I had some business in the area
and I happened to see you.

315
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:55,404
- Did you just finish class now?
- Yes.

316
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:59,671
What's wrong with your face, Dong Gu?
Your eyes look very red too.

317
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:02,189
- Have you not been sleeping?
- No.

318
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:06,260
My eyes tend to get this way. It's okay.

319
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,750
Oh.

320
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,813
Oh, I heard you were
looking for me yesterday.

321
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:13,201
I heard you had something to ask me.

322
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:15,039
Oh, that.

323
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,723
When do you think the issue of THAAD
will be resolved?

324
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:18,804
What?

325
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:22,026
I know you rejected me in five seconds.

326
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,519
We are both Korean citizens.

327
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,031
We can discuss foreign affairs, can't we?

328
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,016
I suppose so.

329
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:31,391
I don't really know much
about foreign affairs though--

330
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:37,059
Are you hungry, Yoon Ah?

331
00:18:41,952 --> 00:18:45,314
All you want to eat
are blood sausages?

332
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:49,086
- Yes, they're my favorite food.
- Oh.

333
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,048
Are you really okay, Dong Gu?
You look very tired.

334
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,560
I'm not.

335
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,990
People often tell me that I look tired.

336
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,548
How are you lately, Yoon Ah?
Are you having fun in class?

337
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:04,659
Yes, it's so much fun.

338
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,338
The people there are so great too.

339
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:11,333
Ah, we learned how to make a cake today.

340
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,328
Dong Gu?

341
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:15,851
Dong Gu.

342
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,561
Yes. What is it?

343
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:19,243
Did you just fall asleep?

344
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,327
No, I was just thinking, just thinking.

345
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,765
Should I dip the sausage in salt
or shrimp paste?

346
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,678
- Your blood sausage is ready.
- Thank you.

347
00:19:29,678 --> 00:19:30,785
No problem.

348
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:32,921
Wow. It looks good.

349
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:37,003
Here. Try it.

350
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:40,922
Dong Gu!

351
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:43,492
Huh? What?

352
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:46,974
Oh, I wasn't sleeping. I was praying.

353
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:48,339
You usually don't.

354
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:52,599
I do when I eat casual street foods,
especially blood sausage.

355
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:57,564
Yum... yum.

356
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,202
I was hungry.

357
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,946
It's so delicious.

358
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:04,722
Right, Dong Gu?

359
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:38,798
So, Jesus was created when
the Catholics were in danger.

360
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,031
Oh my. I came this far
while talking about my siblings.

361
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:46,601
I have more to discuss,
but I think I will end it here.

362
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:47,821
I should go back to the topic.

363
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:52,564
I will finish telling you about my
second sister who enjoyed knitting.

364
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:54,586
My second oldest sister...

365
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:57,875
Joon Ki?

366
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,016
- Joon Ki!
- Yes, yes.

367
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:04,219
Yes, I was listening.
It was about the psychoanalysis.

368
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,847
Ah...

369
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,226
That was 20 hours ago.

370
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,393
- You must be very tired.
- 20 hours?

371
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:16,038
I'm very sorry.

372
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:23,724
Excuse me.

373
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:25,684
What would you like for lunch?

374
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,744
There's meat, fish, salad, and porridge.
You just need to choose one.

375
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:33,976
I know everything about food
and studied it all.

376
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:38,176
So, all you need to do is pick one.
Okay? Please?

377
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:43,348
Please, I'm asking you.

378
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:53,836
I understand.

379
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:57,548
- Joon Ki, what would you like?
- What?

380
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:00,038
Yes, uh...

381
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:02,858
I'll have the meat... the meat.

382
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:05,821
Meat. What kind?

383
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:07,950
Pork, beef, lamb, or chicken?

384
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,954
Pork! Pork, pork.

385
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:14,314
Pork. Pork sounds good.
Shall we go eat, then?

386
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:18,703
Wait.

387
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:23,863
You need to have
the right body type to eat pork.

388
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:25,127
What is it?

389
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,468
What kind of body type are you?

390
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:28,479
If you look at Heo Joon's book
"Dongui Bogam"

391
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:31,414
it tells you how important it is
to eat the right food for your body.

392
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:35,746
Ah, you need to know
all about Heo Joon first.

393
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:37,789
Heo Joon was a physician
in the Joseon Dynasty.

394
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,433
He was the 24th generation of his family.

395
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,542
Heo Joon learned to read early on.

396
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:48,098
He was outstanding in many ways,
but particularly...

397
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,919
- Oh my goodness.
- Su Ah.

398
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,519
- You're still eating?
- Yes. Why?

399
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,490
You said you'd just eat,
but it's been two hours.

400
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,421
Su Ah, we should study now.

401
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:17,839
Hey, you shouldn't even bother
a dog when it's eating.

402
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,873
Aren't you being too severe?

403
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:22,933
I can't study when I'm hungry.

404
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:25,931
Really? Sorry, I was thoughtless.

405
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,375
Eat, eat. Eat in peace.

406
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:30,568
I'm back.

407
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:35,268
What's going on? Where were you?

408
00:23:35,268 --> 00:23:38,048
- Interview with Announcer Park Chang Ho.
- What?

409
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:40,317
You went yesterday. It just ended now?

410
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:42,047
Why did the interview take all night?

411
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,547
Don't even ask.

412
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,698
I've never seen a person
who talks so much in my life.

413
00:23:46,698 --> 00:23:51,443
Just while having lunch,
I learned so much history.

414
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:55,047
- I'm home.
- Yoon Ah.

415
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,856
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes.

416
00:23:56,856 --> 00:24:00,375
I ran into Dong Gu by chance,
so I ate with him.

417
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,448
Oh, Sol must be awake.

418
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:05,934
Huh? Ate with Dong Gu?

419
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:08,807
Dong Gu said he'd be going to Sokcho
yesterday and staying a few days.

420
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:12,184
Really? Then why did he come here?

421
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,909
Hello. Yes, Director.

422
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,548
<i>What's taking you so long?</i>

423
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:31,470
- <i>Where are you right now?</i>
- I'm in the sauna now.

424
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,410
I'm putting my underwear on.

425
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,630
I'm putting my right foot in.

426
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,328
Yes, I'll be there soon.

427
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:42,090
Oh, I won't put a shirt on. I love you.

428
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:48,673
Gosh, I'll get in lots of trouble
once I get back.

429
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:55,301
Still, I got to see Yoon Ah's face,
so it's okay.

430
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:08,401
Oh, Su Ah.

431
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:11,320
- May I come in?
- Of course.

432
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:15,832
Do you have something to say?

433
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:17,184
Not really.

434
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,232
What did you eat with Dong Gu?

435
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:22,162
- Blood sausages.
- Oh, I see.

436
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:24,442
Then Dong Gu must have
gone back to Sokcho.

437
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:27,291
What do you mean Sokcho?
Dong Gu went to Sokcho?

438
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:31,613
You didn't know.
Dong Gu went there yesterday for work.

439
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,221
I wondered why he suddenly came.
He came to see you, Yoon Ah.

440
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:37,612
What? What do you mean?

441
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:41,701
Would a guy hunting for filming locations
come to Seoul to eat blood sausages?

442
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:46,354
Dong Gu is immature
and not very successful.

443
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:48,457
It's hard to see a future with him.

444
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:50,873
He's still a decent guy.

445
00:25:50,873 --> 00:25:55,492
He's nice, affectionate, and warm.

446
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:57,222
That's all I'm saying.

447
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,674
Rest up.

448
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:02,383
Oh yeah. Do you like
that coat I gave you?

449
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:05,534
Yes, it's so pretty and warm.

450
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:06,853
Thank you, Su Ah.

451
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:08,873
You should thank Dong Gu.

452
00:26:08,873 --> 00:26:11,553
Dong Gu bought it to give it to you.

453
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:13,203
What?

454
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:18,271
Oh, you didn't know.
I thought you knew.

455
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:23,076
Yoon Ah, don't tell Dong Gu
that I told you, okay?

456
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:42,105
Gosh, why isn't Joonki_love
posting any comments?

457
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,529
Is something wrong?

458
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:49,213
Should I send a message?

459
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,401
What if I shock her?

460
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:58,500
Joonki_love, this is Lee Joon Ki.

461
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,829
Is something wrong?

462
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,273
Send.

463
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:09,903
What's that?

464
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:11,595
Where did that come from?

465
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:17,184
Kang Seo Jin, that girl.
She left her phone here again.

466
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:21,246
She'll be looking for it
like crazy later on.

467
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,471
What's this?

468
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,703
Joonki_love?

469
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:28,249
What is this?

470
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:40,208
What?

471
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,316
Why are you coming into my room
without permission?

472
00:27:42,316 --> 00:27:43,616
Hey, Kang Seo Jin.

473
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,631
What is this?

474
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:52,960
You were the one writing the comments?

475
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,921
Why did you do it?

476
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:57,885
Why do you think I did it?

477
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:08,069
I'm a little busy now. Can you leave?

478
00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:47,766
Su Ah, how long are you
going to watch TV?

479
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,884
You saw this drama already.

480
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:52,301
You're being so strict.

481
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:54,689
Fine, I'll turn it off.

482
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:58,162
- What do I need to do?
- Huh?

483
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:01,722
- Should we do math?
- Math?

484
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,329
Math is my weakest subject.

485
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:05,463
It's okay. We'll start with the basics.

486
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:07,115
Don't worry.

487
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:10,468
Then, let's start with
this problem first.

488
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:14,012
Here.

489
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:17,516
Hey, isn't this too easy?

490
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:21,476
I may not have the basics,
but you think I can't solve this?

491
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:24,021
- It's 40.
- Huh?

492
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:27,346
Su Ah, how is this 40?

493
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,137
Add 12 and 8, which is 20.

494
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:30,989
Then multiply 20 by 2. That's 40, right?

495
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:33,659
Ah, Su Ah...

496
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,382
When you have addition and multiplication

497
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,345
you have to multiply first.

498
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:41,130
So, you multiply the 8 and 2
and then add the 12.

499
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,415
What? Why do you multiply first?

500
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:48,246
Oh, there's just a rule
of what comes first.

501
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,906
Even if the addition is written first,
you have to multiply first.

502
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:53,096
Why says? Who made that rule?

503
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:55,903
I don't know who made that rule.

504
00:29:55,903 --> 00:30:00,344
What? You're teaching me when you
don't know where the rules come from?

505
00:30:00,344 --> 00:30:03,124
Why do I have to learn it
when you don't even know?

506
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:05,923
Seriously, so absurd.

507
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:08,451
You don't even know,
so who's teaching whom?

508
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:11,141
He sure acted like he knew it all.
What a joke.

509
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:13,585
If you have to compute that first,
write it that way.

510
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:14,929
Why write it like this?

511
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:16,650
Are you teasing me or what?

512
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,999
Do you have a personality problem?

513
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:23,760
Hey, I'm starting to doubt
the basics of math because of you.

514
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:42,452
Do I know Doo Shik?

515
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:46,034
He was the most optimistic man I knew.

516
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:49,513
What happened to that Doo Shik?

517
00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:51,005
Hey, you bonehead.

518
00:30:51,005 --> 00:30:54,016
You can't even do that problem
and you doubt the basics of math?

519
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:56,171
Give up if you're going to be like this.

520
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:59,382
Be diligent if you aren't smart.
Do you have time for dramas?

521
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,012
Do you even understand
the drama dialogue?

522
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:03,237
Hey, hey, hey!

523
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,503
My personality?
How can you question that?

524
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:07,732
I pitied you, so I tried to help.

525
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,769
Bonehead.
Did you graduate junior high?

526
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,175
Hey, you.

527
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:13,503
You bonehead!

528
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,307
Joon Ki, let's work well together.

529
00:31:20,307 --> 00:31:23,199
Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you.

530
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,268
<i>Hey, Kang Seo Jin.</i>

531
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:32,281
You were the one writing comments?

532
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,376
Why did you do it?

533
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,994
Why do you think I did it?

534
00:31:41,815 --> 00:31:44,906
<i>"Lately, I am totally
falling for Octopus Man."</i>

535
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:48,934
<i>"Someday, you will become
a huge star in the world."</i>

536
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:51,113
<i>"Lots of charisma even without lines."</i>

537
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:53,891
<i>"Even if you appear briefly,
it's the best when you're there."</i>

538
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:55,589
<i>"Your acting is the best."</i>

539
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:58,756
<i>"I believe in you, Joon Ki.
You can do it."</i>

540
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:02,290
- Joon Ki!
- That scared me.

541
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,932
Congratulations on passing the audition.

542
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:06,130
That really worked out for you!

543
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,286
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

544
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,743
What did you say?

545
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:11,728
I said thank you!

546
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:14,307
No, I'm the one who's thankful!

547
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,494
You introduced me to Seo Jin!

548
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:21,390
Also, I have a date with Seo Jin today!

549
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,288
- What? A date!
- Yes!

550
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:26,558
I confessed my feelings a few days ago!

551
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:28,769
Seo Jin asked to meet today!

552
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:30,910
That means she's saying yes, right?

553
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,568
Thank you so much, Joon Ki!

554
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:37,460
<i>I will ask you one more time.</i>

555
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,890
To you, Joon Ki...
am I not a woman?

556
00:32:41,738 --> 00:32:44,577
<i>I see you as a man.</i>

557
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:46,192
<i>What should I do?</i>

558
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,853
Ta-da.

559
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,193
Awesome!

560
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:55,002
You can do it!

561
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,063
Congrats, Chewbacca.
Treat us all when you get paid.

562
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,829
You might be a bit fickle,
but you can act.

563
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:03,196
I said I like you, Joon Ki.

564
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,500
- Jae Wook!
- Yeah, what?

565
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,951
I don't think you can meet Seo Jin.

566
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:10,339
What? Why not?

567
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:12,451
- I think I might regret it.
- What do you mean?

568
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,836
What do you mean by that?

569
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:18,355
I think I'll regret it forever
if I lose Seo Jin like this.

570
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:20,196
What?

571
00:33:20,196 --> 00:33:22,518
Forget it if you couldn't hear me!

572
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,559
What are you doing here, Joon Ki?

573
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,598
Seo Jin, let's talk.

574
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:50,518
What are you doing here, Joon Ki?

575
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:53,019
Seo Jin, let's talk.

576
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:55,161
I have nothing to say to you.

577
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:01,025
I'll try it.

578
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:02,432
What are you talking about?

579
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:06,571
I will look at you
as a woman from now on.

580
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:11,793
So, let's try starting.

581
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:13,938
As a man and woman.

582
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,235
Joon Ki.

583
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:27,068
Joon Ki!

584
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:30,293
This is a secret from Dong Gu, okay?

585
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:33,570
If he knows we're dating,
Dong Gu will beat me to death. Got it?

586
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,315
Okay.

587
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:40,543
Let go. People are staring.

588
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,202
No, I won't let you go.

589
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:44,463
I won't ever let you go.

590
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:54,650
Hello.

591
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,706
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

592
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:01,219
Seo Jin, take them to their rooms.

593
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:03,121
- Okay.
- You're here.

594
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:04,952
Joon Ki.

595
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:08,271
Follow me.

596
00:35:09,378 --> 00:35:10,960
Yes. Come in. Come in.

597
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,269
Follow me.

598
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:15,059
I was worried when problems arose
at the place they were staying.

599
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:16,748
Thanks to you, I'm okay.

600
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,141
We're grateful for the guests.

601
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:20,949
We heard you're staying too, Hyun Joon.

602
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:23,112
I need to be a guide for them.

603
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:24,788
Then come this way.

604
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:36,706
What, what, what?

605
00:35:36,706 --> 00:35:39,579
You haven't forgotten
about our date, right?

606
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:41,146
Of course, not.

607
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:43,865
- Then, today is our first date.
- Yes.

608
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:46,251
I'm looking forward to it
so much, aren't you?

609
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:48,679
What are you doing?
What if someone sees us?

610
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:52,342
What's the big deal? No one's here.

611
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:54,320
Oh yeah?

612
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,708
<i>I'm home.</i>

613
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:02,407
Oh. You're... you're here?

614
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:04,500
- You're coming up from Sokcho?
- Yeah.

615
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,090
I'm so tired I could die.

616
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,829
Why are you two together?

617
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:12,300
I warned you not to
go near my little sister.

618
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,170
No, no, no, no! I was going
to the kitchen for water. Really.

619
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,469
Yes, he was.

620
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:19,905
Oh, really?

621
00:36:20,498 --> 00:36:22,478
- What are you doing there?
- Huh?

622
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:25,137
Oh, I was cleaning.

623
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:27,987
There's so much hair on the floor,
look at all that hair.

624
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:29,717
- Really?
- Oh, so much hair.

625
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:32,001
What is that? Is it a present for me?

626
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,717
Oh, this?

627
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:36,811
This is semi-dried squid from Sokcho.

628
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,561
It's the same species as you.

629
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:41,115
Squid and squid.

630
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,934
- What, punk?
- Your bro.

631
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,389
What is that sound?

632
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:49,293
Ah, you know Yoon Ah's
instructor, Hyun Joon?

633
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:52,329
He came here with some guests.
They're staying a few days.

634
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:54,543
That guy Song Hyun Joon is staying here?

635
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:56,275
That punk...

636
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:57,871
What's with him?

637
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:02,521
Oh, Seo Jin. Are you okay?
You're not hurt?

638
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:04,824
I'm okay. I'm okay.

639
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:09,023
The guest house is so pretty.

640
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:11,632
I'm glad to hear that you like it.

641
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:16,653
Oh my! Look who it is.

642
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,686
- Dong Gu, when did you get back?
- Just now.

643
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:21,594
We meet again.

644
00:37:21,594 --> 00:37:24,963
I heard you're staying a few days.

645
00:37:24,963 --> 00:37:26,925
Yes, I'll be staying a few days.

646
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:32,789
Why, out of the many guest houses,
did you choose this shabby place?

647
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:37,239
It's nice to go where you know someone.
Yoon Ah is here.

648
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:40,559
Ah... I see.

649
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,693
Dong Gu, what's that?

650
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,300
Oh, this?

651
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,489
This is semi-dried squid
that I bought from Sokcho.

652
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:52,047
I guess you could say it's
the same species as Hyun Joon.

653
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:53,652
What do you say?

654
00:37:53,652 --> 00:37:55,153
Would like to try one?

655
00:37:55,153 --> 00:38:01,045
This is a welcome squid
for your time in our guest house.

656
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,510
Sure.

657
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:17,152
<i>[Duel to the Death]</i>

658
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,009
<i>Joon Ki, I'm getting off work now.</i>

659
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:30,802
<i>Get ready quickly and come out.
I miss you.</i>

660
00:38:30,802 --> 00:38:33,460
I just can't get used to it.
I just can't.

661
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,940
My gosh.

662
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,405
Who knew I'd end up dating Seo Jin?

663
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:47,440
That's right. That's right.

664
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,630
Kang Seo Jin was a runny-nosed kid
with a mustache.

665
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,221
Who knew I'd be dating this hairy kid?

666
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:57,670
This is unbelievable. It really is.

667
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,469
No, no, no!

668
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:04,369
You started it, so you've got to try.

669
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:07,460
Let's give it a try. Let's go for it!

670
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,065
Hairy, I love you.

671
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:14,420
These guys were like my brothers when
I was studying abroad in New York.

672
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,079
We would go on road trips
whenever it was break time.

673
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,364
I see. That sounds like fun.

674
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,440
Why isn't this opening?

675
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,628
Dong Gu, can you open this for me?

676
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:30,384
All right.

677
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:37,663
It's not opening?

678
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:44,264
It's not opening.
Must be a production issue.

679
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:45,498
I'll try.

680
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:49,137
Something's wrong with it.
The lid is stuck on it.

681
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,554
Wow.

682
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:54,998
- Awesome.
- You're very strong, Hyun Joon.

683
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:56,827
It opened easily.

684
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,878
Hyun Joon, should we grab a drink?

685
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:00,217
Okay, sure.

686
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:02,789
Yoon Ah, we're going to drink.
Do you want to join us?

687
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:06,447
Hey, you shouldn't ask that
of a breastfeeding mother.

688
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:10,208
Dong Gu, Sol has started on formula
and baby food now.

689
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,927
Really? Still, it's so late.
I don't know about drinking.

690
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:15,512
It's only 9:00 pm.

691
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:19,764
Yoon Ah, Sol is asleep, so go on.
I'll clean up here.

692
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:22,284
Is that okay?

693
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:25,405
Then just for today.

694
00:40:25,405 --> 00:40:27,655
Then I'll drink with you too.

695
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:30,077
Well, I'm suddenly craving drinks too.

696
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:31,974
Oh, you must drink well.

697
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:35,353
I don't lose when it comes to drinking.
How about you?

698
00:40:35,353 --> 00:40:37,824
I can drink as much as most people.

699
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:41,159
- Then, would you like to join us?
- Yes, I would.

700
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,413
<i>[Announcer Park Chang Ho]</i>

701
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,010
Why is he calling me?

702
00:40:54,353 --> 00:40:56,902
Yes, Announcer Park. How have you been?

703
00:40:56,902 --> 00:40:58,710
Are you doing well, Joon Ki?

704
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,282
I still have lots to tell you.
Why haven't you come by?

705
00:41:02,282 --> 00:41:04,802
Pardon? Oh...

706
00:41:04,802 --> 00:41:06,661
I'm just so busy lately.

707
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:07,844
<i>I see.</i>

708
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:11,143
Why do you sound so far away?

709
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:14,494
Ah, my cell phone is a little old.

710
00:41:14,494 --> 00:41:16,463
<i>Ah, I understand.</i>

711
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:19,244
Still, it's very convenient
having cell phones.

712
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:23,478
<i>Joon Ki, do you know
how cell phones were created?</i>

713
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:27,148
In order to know their history,
you need to know the phone's history.

714
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:34,054
<i>In 1949 in Havana, Cuba,
Antonio Meucci came up with the idea...</i>

715
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,670
<i>Then how was the smart phone developed?</i>

716
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,630
The current smart phone
was developed by the company IBM.

717
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,275
Joon Ki, I'm here.

718
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:02,059
Why are you sitting like that?

719
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:03,423
Hold on.

720
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:06,693
Yes, Announcer Park.

721
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:09,913
Thank you so much for explaining.

722
00:42:09,913 --> 00:42:12,512
I have to go into a shoot now.

723
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:16,393
Yes, yes.
I'll call you back another time.

724
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:19,043
Ah, yes. Yes.

725
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:22,505
Oh, my ear is hot. Geez.

726
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:23,909
Who was it?

727
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:27,085
Oh, Announcer Park Chang Ho.

728
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,943
Oh, that man who talks a lot?

729
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:34,043
I didn't go see him and now
he's bothering me over the phone.

730
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:36,545
Should I reject his calls?

731
00:42:38,813 --> 00:42:42,447
Sorry, sorry. Let's go.
The movie is starting.

732
00:42:42,447 --> 00:42:45,815
Joon Ki, let's eat popcorn, please?

733
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:50,170
- What is it?
- It's nothing. Nothing at all.

734
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,802
Yes, let's have popcorn.

735
00:43:08,226 --> 00:43:11,608
<i>What kind of movie
has this many kiss scenes?</i>

736
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:14,742
<i>It already feels so awkward.</i>

737
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:23,463
What? You don't like it?

738
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:26,791
No, it's not that.

739
00:43:27,411 --> 00:43:29,951
<i>It's awkward... so awkward.</i>

740
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:32,159
<i>I'm going crazy here.</i>

741
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:35,900
<i>No, stop thinking like this.</i>

742
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,570
<i>She's not that little hairy girl anymore.</i>

743
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:41,753
<i>She's an adult now too.</i>

744
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:44,077
<i>Hm? What's this?</i>

745
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:46,277
<i>Why is her hand so small?</i>

746
00:43:46,277 --> 00:43:48,581
<i>Was her hand always this small?</i>

747
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:55,501
Oh my! No!

748
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:57,250
Joon Ki, what's wrong?

749
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:00,719
What are you staring at?

750
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:01,958
What?

751
00:44:02,454 --> 00:44:06,041
- Do I have a mustache again?
- No, it's not that.

752
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:10,032
Ah, is it because I'm so pretty?

753
00:44:10,032 --> 00:44:13,155
You want to stare at me
even when I'm next to you?

754
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:16,731
I just can't stop you.

755
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,856
It's too bad.

756
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:31,677
Joon Ki, I had so much fun today.

757
00:44:31,677 --> 00:44:34,699
- Yeah.
- Sleep well.

758
00:44:35,688 --> 00:44:38,137
Dream of me tonight.

759
00:44:43,996 --> 00:44:46,737
I can't get used to it.
I think I'm going insane.

760
00:44:46,737 --> 00:44:48,454
<i>Hey!</i>

761
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:51,409
What is that? What's that noise?

762
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,753
Pull yourself together, man.

763
00:44:56,753 --> 00:44:58,268
Why did you drink so much?

764
00:44:58,268 --> 00:45:00,036
I said let go.

765
00:45:00,036 --> 00:45:04,436
I'm going to drink more.

766
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:07,518
What's going on? What's with him?

767
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:10,815
Dong Gu got into a drinking competition
with Hyun Joon and...

768
00:45:10,815 --> 00:45:13,086
I'm sorry. He kept insisting he was okay.

769
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,996
Mr. Dong Gu, please get it together.

770
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:16,818
What? Hey, Bro!

771
00:45:16,818 --> 00:45:23,146
What's this? You promised
to speak informally to me.

772
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:27,335
Call me Dong Gu.... Dong Gu.

773
00:45:27,335 --> 00:45:30,347
Okay, Dong Gu. Pull yourself together.

774
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:32,753
Okay, Big Bro.

775
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:40,384
Oh, you can't forget about
making me sausage bread.

776
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:44,755
Dong Gu loves sausage bread.

777
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:47,056
Okay, I'll put in two sausages.

778
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:49,574
Two? Two sausages?

779
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:50,820
How much did he drink?

780
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,659
Sorry, I'll take him to his room.

781
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:54,798
- I'm fine.
- Let's go, Dong Gu.

782
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:58,115
Joon Ki, Doo Shik!

783
00:46:06,507 --> 00:46:10,358
Oh, it smells like vitamins.
How many vitamins did he take?

784
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:12,697
Gosh, it smells like red ginseng.

785
00:46:12,697 --> 00:46:14,485
What did he eat anyway?

786
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,893
So noisy. My head hurts.

787
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:18,483
I'm dying here.

788
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:20,561
Are you finally awake?

789
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:24,032
- That total nuisance.
- My stomach hurts.

790
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:27,110
Why are you cleaning the floor, huh?

791
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,510
What's going on? What?

792
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,710
Where are my clothes?
Where are they? Who took them off?

793
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,302
We took them off. Why?

794
00:46:35,302 --> 00:46:37,007
- Why?
- You punk!

795
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:39,954
You peed yourself yesterday.

796
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:41,585
What? I did?

797
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:43,106
You think that's all?

798
00:46:43,106 --> 00:46:46,215
You said Hyun Joon was your older brother
now so you hugged and kissed him.

799
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:48,505
I've never seen such a bad drunk.

800
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,405
Older brother? I did that to him?

801
00:46:51,405 --> 00:46:53,594
- Big Bro.
- Hey, hey.

802
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:55,164
You're my brother.

803
00:46:55,164 --> 00:46:58,353
I was nervous when you started
drinking too much to beat him.

804
00:46:58,353 --> 00:47:00,092
Why are you so concerned about Hyun Joon?

805
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:01,972
Why else?

806
00:47:01,972 --> 00:47:06,210
You're jealous because
Yoon Ah is friendly with him, right?

807
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,010
He is still not over Yoon Ah.

808
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,730
No, I'm not interested in Yoon Ah at all.

809
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:16,840
Really? Then I guess you won't care
if I tell her you peed yourself.

810
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,849
Okay, fine. Yoon Ah!

811
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:21,239
No! Don't say anything.

812
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:25,061
Don't say anything.
You really can't.

813
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:28,351
Why? I thought you
weren't interested in her.

814
00:47:29,068 --> 00:47:31,637
Fine, I still like Yoon Ah. So, what?

815
00:47:31,637 --> 00:47:35,797
I tried to forget her,
but I keep thinking of her and miss her.

816
00:47:35,797 --> 00:47:38,277
That's why Hyun Joon
bothers you so much.

817
00:47:38,277 --> 00:47:42,429
Hyun Joon or whoever he is,
he's always around Yoon Ah.

818
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:43,909
You sure have a lot to worry about.

819
00:47:43,909 --> 00:47:46,132
They don't seem to have
any relationship to me.

820
00:47:46,132 --> 00:47:47,253
You think so?

821
00:47:47,253 --> 00:47:50,344
Something just bothers me though.

822
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:52,563
I smell something suspicious.

823
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:55,268
The only smell here is from your blanket!

824
00:47:55,268 --> 00:47:57,289
Go wash it fast. It stinks!

825
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:00,534
What is this? Oh!

826
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:11,041
Hey, Doo Shik. You really have to keep
my peeing a secret from Yoon Ah.

827
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:12,262
I said okay.

828
00:48:12,262 --> 00:48:14,362
By the way...

829
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:19,112
did I really call Song Hyun Joon
my older brother?

830
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:22,902
Yes, I thought two lost brothers
had reunited or something.

831
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:24,608
Quit drinking.

832
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:25,815
I'm crazy.

833
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:28,266
You're awake?

834
00:48:28,266 --> 00:48:30,835
- Is your stomach okay?
- Yes, it is.

835
00:48:30,835 --> 00:48:34,007
How are you going to
face Yoon Ah again?

836
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:36,702
Why? Did I do something else?

837
00:48:36,702 --> 00:48:39,123
You don't remember
giving Yoon Ah an airplane ride?

838
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:40,643
What do you mean airplane?

839
00:48:40,643 --> 00:48:44,507
Yeah, Hawaii!

840
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:46,972
Dong Gu, that's enough now.

841
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:50,298
Paris, let's go.

842
00:48:50,298 --> 00:48:53,373
Oh, oh, oh! There's turbulence.

843
00:48:53,373 --> 00:48:59,913
Oh, oh, oh! But Dong Gu is very stable!

844
00:48:59,913 --> 00:49:02,855
Yoon Ah said she had never been overseas.

845
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:05,501
You lifted Yoon Ah with your feet
and gave her an airplane ride.

846
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:07,353
What? I did that?

847
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:09,965
It was so bad that Yoon Ah
doesn't need to go overseas now.

848
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:12,597
Gosh, you fool.

849
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:17,996
Oh, Dong Gu.

850
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,882
Oh...

851
00:49:19,882 --> 00:49:22,083
- You're awake?
- Yes.

852
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:24,427
Oh, Dong Gu. You feeling okay?

853
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:27,831
I am fine, Mr. Song Hyun Joon.

854
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:32,708
Why are you being like that?
We agreed to be brothers yesterday.

855
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,027
Did I?

856
00:49:34,027 --> 00:49:36,786
I don't remember that at all.

857
00:49:36,786 --> 00:49:40,768
Sorry, Mr. Song Hyun Joon.

858
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:43,547
No. It's not a problem.

859
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:53,117
Yoon Ah, we'll head upstairs.

860
00:49:53,117 --> 00:49:54,672
Yes, sure.

861
00:49:56,012 --> 00:49:59,574
Go on up, Mister Song Hyun Joon.

862
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:03,346
Yoon Ah, I'm really
sorry about yesterday.

863
00:50:03,346 --> 00:50:05,547
- I was so drunk--
- It's all right.

864
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:08,067
Thanks to you,
I rode a plane and it was fun.

865
00:50:12,782 --> 00:50:15,003
Crazy punk, crazy punk.

866
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:17,148
Hyun Joon, show me how to do it.

867
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,853
Okay, just watch me.

868
00:50:24,764 --> 00:50:26,740
Wow.

869
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,653
Hyun Joon,
you're very good at jacks.

870
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:34,246
That's not how you play jacks.

871
00:50:34,246 --> 00:50:36,817
What? What do you mean?

872
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:40,943
Your grip is the
most important thing in jacks.

873
00:50:40,943 --> 00:50:43,132
You need to grab them lightly.

874
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:46,436
If you grab them so roughly,
you'll make many mistakes.

875
00:50:46,436 --> 00:50:48,045
Are you good at jacks too, Dong Gu?

876
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:52,659
Of course. I'm the
King of Jacks in Huam-dong.

877
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,554
Would you like to see?

878
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:58,179
All right. I'll show you.

879
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:04,672
Lightly, lightly. Like this, okay?

880
00:51:09,103 --> 00:51:11,043
You're very good too, Dong Gu.

881
00:51:11,043 --> 00:51:13,980
This is nothing.

882
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,019
It seems like you're
pretty good too, Hyun Joon.

883
00:51:17,019 --> 00:51:21,014
Why don't we play a round for fun?

884
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:24,670
Sure. Shall we?

885
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,744
It's not fun just to play though.

886
00:51:26,744 --> 00:51:29,431
The loser gets 10 finger flicks.

887
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:30,896
What do you think?

888
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,291
Sure, how many years should we bet?

889
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,914
- 50 years?
- That's too few.

890
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:40,637
Let's go with 100.

891
00:51:40,637 --> 00:51:42,820
A man should play for 100 years.

892
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,846
Should we decide who goes first?

893
00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:48,132
You lose if you don't play.
Rock, paper, scissors. Oh dear...

894
00:51:48,132 --> 00:51:50,284
I have paper.

895
00:51:50,284 --> 00:51:52,596
I guess I go first.

896
00:52:03,338 --> 00:52:06,697
100 years, over. I won, Dong Gu.

897
00:52:06,697 --> 00:52:11,246
Wow. Hyun Joon, you are really good.

898
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:16,952
I would've won if I weren't hungover.
You are very lucky.

899
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:19,893
Oh, really?
We'll just say that's true then.

900
00:52:19,893 --> 00:52:21,521
Say that's true.

901
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:25,115
Are you saying I can't beat you
even if I'm not hungover?

902
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:26,871
That's not what I meant.

903
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:29,577
Then let's play one more round.
We'll bet 100 years again.

904
00:52:29,577 --> 00:52:32,724
We'll punish with 10 finger flicks...
no, 20 finger flicks.

905
00:52:32,724 --> 00:52:34,534
Why not?

906
00:52:37,498 --> 00:52:39,094
Hold on.

907
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,775
Yes, Director.

908
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:45,063
Yes, right now?

909
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:48,867
Yes, I'll be right there.

910
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:51,969
I have to leave for work.

911
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:55,215
Let's play again once I return.

912
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:58,536
Wait, Dong Gu...

913
00:52:58,536 --> 00:53:00,476
you forgot something.

914
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:03,257
What? What did I forget?

915
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:14,853
I never imagined Shin Hyun Joon
would agree to take on the Saudi role.

916
00:53:14,853 --> 00:53:17,824
Yes, he wanted to do it
more than I imagined.

917
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:19,967
Shin Hyun Joon felt it was fresh.

918
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:23,068
Do you think he ever imagined
being offered an Arabian role?

919
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:25,454
It's all thanks to Dong Gu.

920
00:53:25,454 --> 00:53:27,385
Shin Hyun Joon is cast.

921
00:53:27,385 --> 00:53:29,208
We have all our locations.

922
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,945
The props are the issue now.

923
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:34,385
- Which gun should the star carry?
- How about a Beretta or a Smith?

924
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:36,416
Isn't that too common?

925
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:39,101
Isn't there something more new?

926
00:53:40,306 --> 00:53:43,657
<i>[Air jacks, air jacks, air jacks]</i>
Kang Dong Gu, do you have an idea?

927
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:47,358
- Air!
- You scared me.

928
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:48,427
What?

929
00:53:48,427 --> 00:53:49,568
What do you mean by air?

930
00:53:49,568 --> 00:53:51,090
What?

931
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,798
An air gun, that's new.

932
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:55,851
- Hey, Kang Dong Gu.
- Yes.

933
00:53:55,851 --> 00:53:58,240
You're an idea bank, a bank.

934
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,164
You've done enough to
earn your wages today, so go home.

935
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:03,409
Yes.

936
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,965
- Who are you?
- Hello.

937
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:37,384
I'm Kang Dong Gu.

938
00:54:37,384 --> 00:54:40,574
Class of 2009,
Korea University, Kang Dong Gu.

939
00:54:40,574 --> 00:54:45,213
You were in the film club with me.

940
00:54:45,213 --> 00:54:47,695
Oh, Kang Dong Gu!

941
00:54:47,695 --> 00:54:49,831
What brings you by?

942
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:54,864
How long has it been?

943
00:54:54,864 --> 00:54:57,934
I think this is the first time
I've seen you since I graduated.

944
00:54:57,934 --> 00:55:00,000
What brought you by, suddenly?

945
00:55:01,114 --> 00:55:03,994
I have a favor to ask.

946
00:55:03,994 --> 00:55:06,324
A favor? What kind?

947
00:55:06,324 --> 00:55:11,123
Do you remember
one of the school festivals?

948
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:12,916
Festivals?

949
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:16,672
When we played the movie...
Was it "Rose Shoes"?

950
00:55:16,672 --> 00:55:17,820
Not that one.

951
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,471
- When we made a bar?
- Not that one either.

952
00:55:20,471 --> 00:55:22,521
Then what?

953
00:55:22,521 --> 00:55:24,940
- The jacks competition.
- What?

954
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,539
You represented our club
and won the championship.

955
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:31,280
It was a 100 year bet
and you set a record.

956
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,826
Yes, I do remember that.

957
00:55:33,826 --> 00:55:35,942
What about that?

958
00:55:35,942 --> 00:55:37,775
Teach me how to play jacks.

959
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:42,706
What? So, you came to me after
eight years to ask me for that?

960
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,407
Yes, I have my reasons.

961
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,318
I have to learn it.
I really want to do well.

962
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:51,507
Senior, I'm asking you, please.

963
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:53,597
Please.

964
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:56,068
Why are you being like this?

965
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:06,867
I assume... you brought the jacks.

966
00:56:15,778 --> 00:56:19,003
You need to adjust the weight.

967
00:56:19,003 --> 00:56:21,135
There's too much metal inside.

968
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:25,215
I prefer 3.2 grams per jack.

969
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,237
Everyone has their own preference.

970
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:29,525
You need to find
the weight that suits you.

971
00:56:29,525 --> 00:56:31,632
Ah, okay.

972
00:56:31,632 --> 00:56:34,887
The best height to throw them
is at eye level.

973
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:37,054
If you throw them over your head,
that's called Mount Baekdu.

974
00:56:37,054 --> 00:56:39,795
That's considered
breaking a rule in this game.

975
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:42,731
Ah, Mount Baekdu.

976
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:45,795
Then should we start
with the first stage?

977
00:56:45,795 --> 00:56:51,670
First, you need keep the jacks
spread out as far as you can.

978
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,106
- Spread.
- Like this.

979
00:56:53,106 --> 00:56:55,648
- Spread it out, okay?
- Okay.

980
00:56:55,648 --> 00:56:58,206
The second stage is to split them.

981
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:02,476
Make sure your opponent doesn't notice
and slightly lift up your middle finger.

982
00:57:02,476 --> 00:57:04,018
- Wow!
- In one moment.

983
00:57:04,018 --> 00:57:07,588
This is not against the rules.
It's a tactic.

984
00:57:07,588 --> 00:57:12,940
Third, keep one slightly under your
thumb so that it falls a little late.

985
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,570
Hold on to it.

986
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,255
You must have three in a safe spot first.

987
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:20,300
- Okay?
- Three have to be safe first.

988
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:24,907
It's so cold.

989
00:57:26,206 --> 00:57:28,710
What's taking her so long?

990
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:36,771
<i>It's me, Park Chang Ho.</i>

991
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:38,331
Oh, gosh.

992
00:57:38,331 --> 00:57:42,202
I'm ignoring his calls,
so now he's texting me.

993
00:57:42,202 --> 00:57:44,492
He sure sends long messages too.

994
00:57:44,492 --> 00:57:47,751
Is this a thesis or something?

995
00:57:47,751 --> 00:57:51,751
It must be like a thousand messages.

996
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:54,188
Sorry, Joon Ki. I was late, right?

997
00:57:54,188 --> 00:57:55,512
No, no.

998
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:58,090
What should we do today, Joon Ki?

999
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,532
Whatever you want to do.

1000
00:57:59,532 --> 00:58:02,688
Then let's go do karaoke.

1001
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,030
Karaoke?

1002
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,960
What? You don't want to?

1003
00:58:10,351 --> 00:58:13,309
No, let's go. Let's go.

1004
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:15,722
Yes, karaoke.

1005
00:58:16,956 --> 00:58:18,762
How fun.

1006
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:22,382
Oh, Joon Ki. I always wanted to
sing this once I got a boyfriend.

1007
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:23,849
Can I go first?

1008
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:26,382
Yes, go ahead.

1009
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:32,331
<i>4777.</i>

1010
00:58:32,331 --> 00:58:35,460
I can't get used to it.
It's driving me crazy.

1011
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:46,831
<i>I've waited for today.</i>

1012
00:58:48,478 --> 00:58:52,079
<i>I knew this day would come.</i>

1013
00:58:53,505 --> 00:58:58,188
<i>The two of us alone together.</i>

1014
00:58:58,188 --> 00:59:01,264
<i>I waited for this day.</i>

1015
00:59:02,588 --> 00:59:04,597
<i>I have...</i>

1016
00:59:04,597 --> 00:59:08,237
Why did you do that?
I was singing that.

1017
00:59:08,237 --> 00:59:11,331
Why would a kid like you
sing such a sexy song?

1018
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:13,547
- What are you talking about?
- Be quiet!

1019
00:59:13,547 --> 00:59:16,927
Just sing songs like this, you kid.

1020
00:59:16,927 --> 00:59:18,858
<i>156.</i>

1021
00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:20,469
What? Pororo?

1022
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:23,302
Wow, it's Pororo!

1023
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:31,123
<i>I love to play the most.</i>

1024
00:59:31,123 --> 00:59:33,820
<i>Friends, gather around.</i>

1025
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,523
Why aren't you singing?
Hurry up and sing.

1026
00:59:38,389 --> 00:59:41,460
<i>Playful Pororo.</i>

1027
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,625
Louder!

1028
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:54,141
We're already home. Too bad.

1029
00:59:54,141 --> 00:59:57,630
If I married you,
I wouldn't have to say bye to you.

1030
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,070
What? Married?

1031
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,659
Joon Ki, where should we go
on our honeymoon if we get married?

1032
01:00:04,659 --> 01:00:07,481
What? Honey... honeymoon?

1033
01:00:07,481 --> 01:00:09,759
I want to go to the Maldives.

1034
01:00:09,759 --> 01:00:12,253
- Also--
- Stop, stop!

1035
01:00:12,804 --> 01:00:15,900
This kid is saying all sorts of things.

1036
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,815
This isn't right. It just isn't.

1037
01:00:20,588 --> 01:00:25,101
Seo Jin, I need to tell you something.

1038
01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:31,969
Seo Jin, I tried my best.

1039
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:36,010
You still seem like a kid to me.
What should I do?

1040
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:41,672
No matter how much I try,
I can't see you as a woman.

1041
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:43,632
So...

1042
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,867
let's end it here, okay?

1043
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:52,030
I'm sorry, Seo Jin.

1044
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,639
Wait.

1045
01:01:03,643 --> 01:01:06,237
Don't do this, Seo Jin.

1046
01:01:06,237 --> 01:01:08,326
Please understand me.

1047
01:01:29,675 --> 01:01:33,273
Do you still not see me as a woman?

1048
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:36,313
I see you.

1049
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:38,648
I see you as a woman.

1050
01:01:38,648 --> 01:01:41,739
No, no. That was a weak answer.

1051
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,056
I guess you still
don't see me as a woman.

1052
01:01:44,056 --> 01:01:45,333
Huh?

1053
01:01:48,695 --> 01:01:52,697
You punk!

1054
01:01:58,871 --> 01:02:02,485
What was that?
Dong Gu didn't see us just now?

1055
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,224
I don't think so.

1056
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:05,746
What's wrong with him?

1057
01:02:05,746 --> 01:02:08,907
I don't know.
He seems like he's lost it.

1058
01:02:08,907 --> 01:02:12,206
Well, it's a relief
that he didn't see us.

1059
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:16,960
I'm back!

1060
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:20,351
Dong Gu, you're home?
Did you have dinner?

1061
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:22,371
I don't need to eat. More importantly...

1062
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,726
we should play one more round
like we promised earlier.

1063
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:28,753
Jacks.

1064
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,378
What?

1065
01:02:52,806 --> 01:02:56,211
The person who gets
100 years first is the winner.

1066
01:02:56,211 --> 01:02:59,344
Punishment is 20 finger flicks.

1067
01:02:59,344 --> 01:03:01,083
Is that all right?

1068
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,733
Yes. Sounds good.

1069
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:04,925
Let's set the rules, then.

1070
01:03:06,713 --> 01:03:10,003
There can be no Mount Baekdu.

1071
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:12,898
If the jack goes above the head,
it's out. You know that, right?

1072
01:03:12,898 --> 01:03:14,561
Yes, I know.

1073
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:17,284
Then we should not have baskets either.

1074
01:03:17,284 --> 01:03:20,108
When we're catching...

1075
01:03:20,108 --> 01:03:21,806
you're out if you catch like this.

1076
01:03:21,806 --> 01:03:23,416
Of course.

1077
01:03:24,648 --> 01:03:25,994
Also...

1078
01:03:27,507 --> 01:03:30,519
we will keep the Arirang Catch.

1079
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:32,398
Of course.

1080
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:34,809
We'll have to keep the Arirang Catch.

1081
01:03:35,706 --> 01:03:37,846
Let's start, then.

1082
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:39,384
Let's see who starts first.

1083
01:03:39,384 --> 01:03:41,400
You lose if you don't play.
Rock, paper, scissors.

1084
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,536
I've won.

1085
01:03:52,536 --> 01:03:55,744
Then, I will start.

1086
01:04:07,072 --> 01:04:08,280
<i>[Mount Baekdu line]</i>

1087
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,632
Penalty!

1088
01:04:12,242 --> 01:04:13,708
Mount Baekdu.

1089
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:19,969
Caught it.

1090
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:27,498
Bad catch.

1091
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,996
Yes. Of course.

1092
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:57,905
<i>[Dong Gu: 52
Hyun Joon: 56]</i>

1093
01:05:01,724 --> 01:05:05,376
<i>Right now,
Song Hyun Joon has 96 years.</i>

1094
01:05:05,376 --> 01:05:07,811
<i>Kang Dong Gu has 83 years.</i>

1095
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:19,500
<i>If I miss this chance,
Song Hyun Joon will win.</i>

1096
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:22,891
<i>This is it.</i>

1097
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:26,945
<i>What should I do?
What am I supposed to do?</i>

1098
01:05:26,945 --> 01:05:28,393
<i>Ah...</i>

1099
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:36,827
Lastly, when you're in
a truly dangerous situation

1100
01:05:36,827 --> 01:05:38,976
I will teach you a lethal move.

1101
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,257
A lethal move?

1102
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:44,137
A situation where the game will end
once it's the opponent's turn.

1103
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:46,226
Suppose it is your turn.

1104
01:05:46,226 --> 01:05:48,735
You've already done your catch.

1105
01:05:48,735 --> 01:05:51,806
Now, you have four jacks
on the back of your hand.

1106
01:05:51,806 --> 01:05:53,898
In that moment...

1107
01:05:53,898 --> 01:05:55,577
what will you choose to do?

1108
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:58,757
Well, I will safely catch the four jacks.

1109
01:05:58,757 --> 01:06:00,210
Then try again.

1110
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,280
No, no, no!

1111
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,039
Once you choose that,
the game is over.

1112
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,050
What guarantee do you have that you won't
make a mistake from stage one to four?

1113
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,751
Then, what do I do?

1114
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:16,110
You have to throw the winning catch.

1115
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:18,001
The Arirang Catch.

1116
01:06:18,001 --> 01:06:19,501
Arirang Catch?

1117
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:23,510
The Arirang Catch requires you
to go from top to bottom once.

1118
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:25,081
Then from bottom to top once.

1119
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,860
You catch the jacks in twos.

1120
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,626
It's a difficult skill.

1121
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:31,806
It is given five times
the normal catch score.

1122
01:06:31,806 --> 01:06:33,806
That's why it's a lethal weapon.

1123
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:34,923
Five times?

1124
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:38,076
When you are cornered...

1125
01:06:38,076 --> 01:06:42,114
don't ever forget the Arirang Catch.

1126
01:06:42,114 --> 01:06:46,264
<i>Yes, I have nowhere else to go.</i>

1127
01:06:46,264 --> 01:06:50,014
<i>I have to throw the winning catch now.</i>

1128
01:06:50,014 --> 01:06:52,125
<i>It's chilly here.</i>

1129
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:55,304
<i>There is a knife in my heart.</i>

1130
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:57,882
<i>However, do not worry.</i>

1131
01:06:58,545 --> 01:07:00,173
<i>I...</i>

1132
01:07:01,025 --> 01:07:03,612
<i>have the Arirang Catch.</i>

1133
01:07:51,489 --> 01:07:52,670
Wow.

1134
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,396
Success. I succeeded
with the Arirang Catch!

1135
01:07:57,396 --> 01:07:58,722
You saw that, right? You saw?

1136
01:07:58,722 --> 01:08:01,661
The Arirang Catch is worth
5 times more, so I got 20 years.

1137
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,802
Then I won, right?

1138
01:08:11,469 --> 01:08:15,280
Dong Gu, I lost.

1139
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,579
I think I played too long.
My back hurts.

1140
01:08:18,579 --> 01:08:22,289
I think I need to go to the bathroom.

1141
01:08:22,289 --> 01:08:24,164
Hyun Joon.

1142
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,317
I think you forgot something.

1143
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:45,850
Kang Dong Gu.

1144
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:04,500
Thank you for the past few days.
I'll be going now.

1145
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:07,011
Get home safely.

1146
01:09:08,033 --> 01:09:09,412
Wait.

1147
01:09:10,574 --> 01:09:12,293
Let me ask you one thing.

1148
01:09:12,293 --> 01:09:13,619
Yes, what is it?

1149
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:19,331
I heard you're letting Yoon Ah
use your kitchen to practice baking.

1150
01:09:19,331 --> 01:09:21,319
- What's that about?
- What?

1151
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:24,131
- What do you mean?
- It's strange.

1152
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:26,530
There are many other students.

1153
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,273
Why would you do that only for Yoon Ah?

1154
01:09:29,273 --> 01:09:33,320
It's because of the empathy
I have as a single parent.

1155
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,462
Ah, I see.

1156
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:39,225
- I thought--
- That's what it was.

1157
01:09:39,225 --> 01:09:41,779
Now, I'm interested in her.

1158
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,650
What did you say?

1159
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:46,082
I'm interested in Yoon Ah.

1160
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:49,886
No... I like Yoon Ah.
