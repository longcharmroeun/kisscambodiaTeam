1
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:13,825
There are...

2
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:17,425
six Japanese bullets inside my body.

3
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,880
This is where I got shot in 1922, in Gyeongseong...

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,120
during the assassination of the governor, Terauchi.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,890
There are two holes.

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:25,560
This is from Hwangpo Port in 1922.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,190
This is from Khabarovsk in 1927.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,470
This is from the bombing in Ichigo in 1932.

9
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:34,040
And there's another one right next to my heart from 1933.

10
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:36,400
You're saying that I betrayed three of my friends.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,445
You have no idea...

12
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:41,915
how I felt when I had to send them.

13
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:43,780
I was...

14
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:46,750
risking my life to fight back,

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,150
Your Honor.

16
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:50,495
All right. You can leave your profile there.

17
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:53,520
Okay. I am Lee Jun Ki, a new actor.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,835
Please remember me.

19
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,560
Sir,

20
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:02,160
we are really close to the shooting. How can we find an actor so soon?

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,375
I'm worried too.

22
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,105
Wait.

23
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:07,775
Hey,

24
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:11,415
- would you come here for a bit? - Me? Sure.

25
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:18,780
What's going on?

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,280
What's your height and weight?

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,080
It's 181cm and 71kg.

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,795
181cm and 71kg?

29
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:26,620
Would you like to work on our movie?

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,930
There's a role for you.

31
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:29,135
Really?

32
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:32,135
I will do my best in whatever role you give me.

33
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:33,735
That's good.

34
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,705
The thing is, it's actually a role for...

35
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:39,700
a bed scene.

36
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:41,645
So it's actually a stand-in...

37
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:44,145
for a bed scene?

38
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,415
That's a bit...

39
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,140
- You wouldn't want it, right? - I don't think I can do that.

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,380
Well, your physical condition is just like the main character's.

41
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,910
I was just asking in case. Alright. You can go now.

42
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,225
I see. Thanks!

43
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:58,695
Gosh...

44
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:02,090
We booked the place and even finished setting things up.

45
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,335
Soo Jung thinks we are shooting on that day.

46
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:10,600
Wait, is that...

47
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:13,700
the epitome of an innocence, curvy girl, Shin Soo Jung?

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,870
- Yes, that's right. - Does that mean...

49
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,370
Shin Soo Jung is going to be in the bed scene with me?

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,370
That's right.

51
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,310
Shin Soo Jung is the main actress of our film.

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,710
I'll do that bed scene.

53
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,340
I can even be fully naked!

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,340
Okay, that's great!

55
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,455
You have no idea!

56
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:33,935
("Jealousy is My Power")

57
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:39,090
Put it thoroughly everywhere.

58
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,130
Okay.

59
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,460
My back is especially important.

60
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,760
So keep that in mind.

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
Okay!

62
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,070
You have to keep your promise, okay?

63
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,110
- I want Soo Jung's autograph. - I get it.

64
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:51,870
Apply it thoroughly. Don't leave out anywhere.

65
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,470
Stay still.

66
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,855
- I'm home. - My back!

67
00:02:57,655 --> 00:02:59,580
What is this disgusting picture?

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,450
Jun Ki got cast in a movie.

69
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,610
So he's taking care of his skin.

70
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,320
What kind of role makes you take care of your back?

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,460
It is...

72
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:08,450
a stand-in for a bed scene.

73
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,565
What? A stand-in for a bed scene?

74
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:14,190
I can't believe you are taking that kind of role.

75
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,270
Wait a second.

76
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:17,030
What do you mean by that?

77
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,075
Do you know who's in that scene with me?

78
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:22,030
It's Shin Soo Jung.

79
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,070
I would have taken the job...

80
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,470
even as a staff with such a humble attitude.

81
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,740
I should be like, "Of course, I will do it!"

82
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,270
He is right about it. It's not anyone else. It's Shin Soo Jung.

83
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,685
Goodness.

84
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,925
You guys are all the same.

85
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,195
- I'm leaving now. - I see.

86
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:39,525
Where are you going?

87
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:42,290
It's your first day at the baking class, right?

88
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,565
- Yes. - Have fun.

89
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:47,260
Don't fall asleep during class, and focus on what the teacher says.

90
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,130
- Okay. - Did you not forget anything?

91
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,230
Of course not.

92
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,300
I have my wallet here, and I didn't forget my phone either.

93
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,600
- Do you know how to get there? - Of course.

94
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,115
As I know,

95
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:00,215
- it's... - Take this.

96
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,510
It's the bus number and the name of the stop.

97
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,655
I even wrote down where the institute is. Just follow it.

98
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,325
Thank you, Dong Gu.

99
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,365
I'll go now.

100
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:12,320
- Have fun! - I will.

101
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,735
- Watch out for cars. - Okay!

102
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,235
What's going on?

103
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,160
That was like a typical, morning farewell routine...

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,660
of a newly-married couple.

105
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,760
I agree.

106
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,545
You even wrote down the directions.

107
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:27,815
I can smell something suspicious.

108
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:30,140
What are you talking about?

109
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,440
What's so suspicious about it? I was worried that...

110
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,315
she'd bother me again after getting lost.

111
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,840
What are you smelling?

112
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,050
Why are you so upset? We are just joking.

113
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,855
What's wrong with him?

114
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:43,525
I don't know. That made him look more suspicious.

115
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,620
What's so suspicious now?

116
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,250
Are they saying that I like Yoon Ah or something?

117
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,660
It's just sympathy.

118
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,860
I'm doing a kind of community service.

119
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,630
Of course. That's what it is.

120
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:59,100
It's my fault to be so nice like this.

121
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,775
I'm so nice.

122
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:03,810
First of all... Are you writing it down well?

123
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,215
It's about kneading the flour with hot water.

124
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,215
Goodness.

125
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,255
Thank you.

126
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:22,735
This will make my skin looks like a baby's.

127
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:23,930
Awesome.

128
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:25,990
Dong Gu, can you put it...

129
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,890
all over my bottom when we get home?

130
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,030
Are you insane? I won't do that.

131
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,730
Why are you asking me to do that? Are you out of your mind?

132
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,600
Don't make such a big deal out of it.

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,915
Please do it for me.

134
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,015
Isn't that Yoon Ah?

135
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:40,740
Thanks for driving me home. Take care.

136
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,885
Sure.

137
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:46,120
- Yoon Ah! - Why are you outside?

138
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,380
Were you waiting for me?

139
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,710
Why would we wait for you?

140
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,725
We went out to get Sol's diapers.

141
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:52,365
Who was that?

142
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:54,420
I met him during class.

143
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,665
He offered me a ride because his place was on the way too.

144
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,420
Yoon Ah, you are already so popular there.

145
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,830
What are you talking about?

146
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,760
Yoon Ah, why would you get in a stranger's car?

147
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,830
She met him in class.

148
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,860
And...

149
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,875
why would you care so much about what car Yoon Ah gets in?

150
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:11,445
That's...

151
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:13,645
because she's bothering others.

152
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,140
I told you. Bothering others and owing them...

153
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,340
Can become my habit?

154
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,810
Fine. I'll keep that in mind.

155
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,295
I'm glad you know!

156
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:26,225
Why is he like that? What?

157
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:34,760
What is it? Is there something wrong with it?

158
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,375
I would love to read something more provocative.

159
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:40,575
I don't know what you mean by that.

160
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,475
Here.

161
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:44,970
This film can be a reference.

162
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,900
"Madame Freedom 2017".

163
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,570
"I want to have some fun tonight."

164
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,840
Exactly.

165
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,185
Okay, I'll watch it just in case.

166
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:58,820
Don't work out too much until this evening.

167
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,520
And maintain your weight well.

168
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,835
Okay.

169
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:03,730
The main actor will arrive shortly.

170
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:05,190
We'll match details like...

171
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,660
your hairstyle and your skin tone.

172
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,305
Don't worry too much. You guys are quite similar already.

173
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,075
You are here!

174
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,400
- Hello, sir. - Right.

175
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,430
Say hello.

176
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,115
This is Lee Jun Ki, your stand-in for the bed scene.

177
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,540
Hello, I'm Lee Jun Ki.

178
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,380
I'm Kim Woo Sung. Nice to meet you.

179
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:24,685
I'm your fan.

180
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:30,780
Wait.

181
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,960
You seem to have lost weight in the past few days.

182
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:35,520
I was sick. I lost a lot of weight really fast,

183
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,660
- and it won't come back. - That's too bad.

184
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,460
Really? How much weight did you lose?

185
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,260
I used to weigh 71kg,

186
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,675
but I weighed about 60kg this morning.

187
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:46,130
What? How much did you say you weighed?

188
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,370
I weigh 71kg.

189
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,745
I think we'll have to find someone thinner then.

190
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:55,185
What? That's not okay.

191
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,410
Director, I'll lose some weight.

192
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,180
Can you lose 10kg?

193
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,890
I'll do it by all means.

194
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,235
You promised to lose 10kg in a week?

195
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,990
Why do you want to shoot this bed scene so badly?

196
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,290
You still don't get it?

197
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,975
Shin Soo Jung.

198
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:16,860
That's all I can say.

199
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,945
You'd jump into a fire if you could shoot a bed scene with her.

200
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:24,740
I'd even jump off a cliff.

201
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,945
Exactly.

202
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,140
Yoon Ah, are you there?

203
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,555
Who could it be?

204
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:33,955
It smells so good.

205
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:36,125
What's all this?

206
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:40,125
I wanted to bake some donuts,

207
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:41,935
and I ended up baking too much.

208
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:43,795
Have a taste.

209
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:47,335
Thank you.

210
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:50,035
Can you introduce him to us?

211
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,975
You gave Yoon Ah a ride earlier, right?

212
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,430
Aren't you taking the same baking class?

213
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,570
That's right.

214
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,100
Hi. I'm Lee Sang Yeon.

215
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,985
- I saw you. - Nice to meet you.

216
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:02,140
You must be Sol.

217
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,325
How cute. Peekaboo.

218
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:09,280
You gave Yoon Ah a ride...

219
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,890
and brought donuts here.

220
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,650
Are you interested in her?

221
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,935
Green light?

222
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:17,635
Yes. Well...

223
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,675
I am interested in Yoon Ah.

224
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:30,715
It's just how I feel about you. Don't take it too seriously.

225
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:33,540
Gosh, it's hot.

226
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,010
Can I use the bathroom?

227
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,555
Sure. It's over there.

228
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:40,455
Okay. Excuse me.

229
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:44,665
He proposed with donuts.

230
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,220
What's going on? He must be interested in you.

231
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,330
Don't be absurd. It's not like that.

232
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,090
He just said it himself.

233
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,030
Go for it. He seems like a nice person.

234
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:56,830
You only just met him. How do you know what he's like?

235
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,605
I don't like the look in his eyes.

236
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:00,800
Yoon Ah, be careful of that guy.

237
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
- What? - Hey.

238
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,070
Who are you to tell her that?

239
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,010
I'm just concerned. That's all.

240
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:11,080
I don't want her to let some weird guy ruin her life.

241
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,255
Be quiet. That's enough.

242
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:14,950
The donuts look tasty. Try one.

243
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,225
Forget it. I don't...

244
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:20,695
- I said I didn't want it. - Stop yelling at me.

245
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:23,795
What a waste. Why did you drop it?

246
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:32,775
(Bong Du Shik, Han Yoon Ah)

247
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:36,445
(Han Yoon Ah)

248
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,325
What are you doing here?

249
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:50,725
Why are you using someone else's toothbrush?

250
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:55,150
I wanted to brush my teeth.

251
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,660
You could have asked for a toothbrush.

252
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,365
- Why would you use Yoon Ah's? - What?

253
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:04,005
This is Yoon Ah's?

254
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:05,970
I had no idea.

255
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,115
You're lying. Her name is written right there.

256
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,415
Oh, I see it now.

257
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,185
My goodness.

258
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,595
I really had no idea.

259
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,295
Excuse me now.

260
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,965
Her name is written right there. What's with him?

261
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:35,205
I had so much fun today.

262
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:36,600
I'll be going now.

263
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,260
Yoon Ah, see you in class.

264
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,875
Okay. See you.

265
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:41,900
- Bye. - Come again.

266
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,245
Bye.

267
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:46,445
- He's cool. - Yoon Ah, come here.

268
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,155
Sit down.

269
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:51,325
Yoon Ah, he's amazing.

270
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:54,050
I agree. He has good manners and seems nice.

271
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,825
He seems nice?

272
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:58,695
There's something weird about him.

273
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,695
What is it now?

274
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:03,290
When I went to the bathroom,

275
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:05,590
I caught him using Yoon Ah's toothbrush.

276
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,560
What? My toothbrush?

277
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,960
He probably wanted to freshen up.

278
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,900
It's still not okay to use someone else's toothbrush.

279
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,545
Why is it not okay? I use yours sometimes.

280
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:16,270
What? Why?

281
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,040
Yours is softer.

282
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,810
Mine is so stiff.

283
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:21,740
It hurts. It makes my mouth bleed.

284
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,115
Gosh, that's disgusting.

285
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:25,480
Anyway, I really don't like him.

286
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,680
He's a bit weird.

287
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,395
You're weirder.

288
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:32,360
What? Are you jealous because he's getting close with Yoon Ah?

289
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,650
Exactly.

290
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,665
You drew a map for Yoon Ah this morning.

291
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,065
Do you have feelings for her?

292
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:44,305
What? Me?

293
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:45,775
Yoon Ah?

294
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:49,175
Forget it. I have nothing to say.

295
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:53,500
If I'm concerned about a girl, does it mean that I like her?

296
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,015
It just means that I'm nice.

297
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:58,080
- Stop it. - He's been...

298
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,580
What's wrong?

299
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,150
I've been talking too much. I'm hungry.

300
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,650
Do you think you can lose 10kg by starving for a week?

301
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,790
I don't even know how to lose weight.

302
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,250
Ask Seo Jin for help.

303
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,105
She's on a diet all year around.

304
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:12,735
Really?

305
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:15,490
Seo Jin, can you help me lose weight?

306
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,735
For free?

307
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,045
You slave of capitalism.

308
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:22,845
Fine. I'll buy you a new-model razor.

309
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:25,140
It's said to remove hair by the root.

310
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,400
Okay.

311
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,885
But you have to follow my orders no matter what.

312
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:33,455
What's this?

313
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:35,725
Right. I have to watch this.

314
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:39,365
But what if someone walks in on me?

315
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:52,645
- Why are you so startled? - What?

316
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:54,315
I'm not startled.

317
00:13:54,615 --> 00:13:56,230
Why didn't you knock?

318
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,345
It's my room. Why would I?

319
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:01,555
What? Were you watching something dirty?

320
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:03,910
No. What are you talking about?

321
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,010
You're being silly.

322
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,750
Then again, you never watch those.

323
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:09,295
You're so innocent.

324
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,390
Hey.

325
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:13,395
What? What is it?

326
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:18,905
It's about that guy, Sang Yeon. Didn't you find him weird?

327
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,905
Didn't he look like a pervert?

328
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,175
Well, I'm not sure.

329
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,145
Really?

330
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:28,300
He looked a bit weird.

331
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,030
By the way, is this door broken?

332
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,670
Yes. It's been broken for a while now. Why?

333
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,045
It's nothing.

334
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,780
Oh, I didn't know you were in.

335
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,020
Why can't you knock?

336
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,335
Sorry. I didn't know you were here.

337
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:51,220
What are you doing with your laptop here?

338
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,430
Me? I'm working on a scenario.

339
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,090
Ideas seem to pop up when I work in the bathroom.

340
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,860
Really? Then go on.

341
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,360
Let me just wash my hands.

342
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,705
Okay.

343
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:03,045
Hey.

344
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:05,515
What? What is it?

345
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:08,715
Now that I think of it, there was no toothpaste on that toothbrush.

346
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:11,310
Who brushes his teeth without any toothpaste?

347
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,585
- It's not that strange. - Really?

348
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:16,250
It's not strange?

349
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,320
By the way, is this door broken too?

350
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,680
Yes, it's been a while. Why?

351
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,820
- What about the guest rooms? - The doors are all broken.

352
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,190
There's no single working door in this house.

353
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,720
Then fix them, you punk.

354
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,405
Why would you leave them unfixed?

355
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,005
I'm not the only one who runs this place.

356
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:33,805
That brat.

357
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:38,345
There was no toothpaste. Am I mistaken?

358
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:41,685
Does wrapping your body with a wrap make you lose weight?

359
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,880
Put them on. All of them.

360
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,410
I have to shoot the bed scene.

361
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,010
Where are you going?

362
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,050
Nowhere.

363
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,825
Jumping jacks.

364
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,860
Shin Soo Jung!

365
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:56,920
- Bed scene! - You'd jump into a fire...

366
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,560
if you could shoot a bed scene with her.

367
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,100
I'd even jump off a cliff.

368
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,400
Get up!

369
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,745
Shin Soo Jung. Bed scene.

370
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,845
Shin Soo Jung. Bed scene.

371
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,685
Shin Soo Jung. Bed scene.

372
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,810
Bed scene!

373
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:15,615
Shin Soo Jung!

374
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,095
Where is Du Shik?

375
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:25,190
He has a meeting with the director.

376
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:27,365
He's busy writing a scenario these days.

377
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:32,635
Jun Ki, are you all right?

378
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,105
Jun Ki.

379
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:38,860
I saw...

380
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,930
Gosh.

381
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,210
What is it? Are you okay?

382
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:43,545
I'm okay.

383
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:45,540
I must have passed out.

384
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,440
I know you're on a diet, but you should eat something.

385
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,140
You'll die at this rate.

386
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,110
I'm okay.

387
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,025
I'll just drink some water.

388
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:58,925
No. From today on, you're not even allowed to drink water.

389
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:00,825
The shooting is only two days away.

390
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,860
Isn't this too much?

391
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,205
If you don't want to shoot a bed scene with Shin Soo Jung,

392
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:09,375
drink it.

393
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:21,255
I have to shoot it. I will.

394
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,455
Bed scene.

395
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:25,385
Yoon Ah, I'm here.

396
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,755
That sounds like Sang Yeon.

397
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,765
Why is he here again?

398
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,390
What brings you here, Sang Yeon?

399
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,920
There's a delicious pizza restaurant in my neighborhood.

400
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,535
I brought some to share with you.

401
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:46,940
I'm sorry, but we just finished eating.

402
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:48,170
What are you talking about?

403
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,275
There's always room for pizza.

404
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:52,085
Thank you.

405
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:54,985
You're being greedy.

406
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,065
Don't you dare.

407
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:11,690
You stubborn wench.

408
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,575
You wouldn't even bleed if I pricked you.

409
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,805
This pizza is so delicious.

410
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:19,805
Really?

411
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,930
Have some, Sang Yeon.

412
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,700
No, I already had some.

413
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,085
Help yourself, Yoon Ah.

414
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,585
Thank you.

415
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:35,595
Hey.

416
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:40,265
- Yes? - What are you doing?

417
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:43,690
- What did I do? - What's wrong?

418
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,235
He smelled Yoon Ah's hair.

419
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,335
I did?

420
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:50,900
I didn't.

421
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:52,930
I smelled pizza.

422
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,270
I definitely saw you. Stop lying.

423
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,100
You probably didn't see it clearly.

424
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,600
Why would he smell my hair?

425
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,155
Exactly.

426
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,925
What's wrong with smelling hair?

427
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:07,880
I smell your hair sometimes.

428
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,110
My hair? Why would you?

429
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,795
Your hair...

430
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:14,665
smells delicious.

431
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:16,850
- What? - It looks tasty like jjajangmyeon.

432
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,690
What? Stop it. Goodness.

433
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,560
I definitely saw him smell her hair.

434
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,190
Where are your manners?

435
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,830
I definitely saw him.

436
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,660
I really did. This is crazy.

437
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,875
Goodness.

438
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm sorry, Sang Yeon.

439
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,300
I apologize on his behalf.

440
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,445
It's okay.

441
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:35,855
It's my fault that he misunderstood.

442
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:37,670
While you eat,

443
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,140
I'll look around.

444
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,325
Sure.

445
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:42,995
Yoon Ah.

446
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:45,465
You have something on your lips.

447
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,535
- Thank you. - It's a mole.

448
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,620
Do I go this way?

449
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,605
Yes, feel free to take a look around.

450
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:58,405
Why are you taking that?

451
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:02,030
- Why would he take that? - What's wrong with you?

452
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,515
He took the tissue with him!

453
00:20:04,545 --> 00:20:06,070
Calm down.

454
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,410
I'm about to lose my mind!

455
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,150
He took the tissue.

456
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:12,310
You don't have the right to eat!

457
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,155
You have to shoot a bed scene.

458
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:15,925
Be quiet.

459
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,765
It smells like Yoon Ah.

460
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:43,910
I think...

461
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,310
Sang Yeon really likes you. What do you think of him?

462
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,050
It's not like that.

463
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,750
Why don't you date him?

464
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,620
He's handsome and polite.

465
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,295
He even has a nice car. That means he's successful.

466
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:57,090
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

467
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,765
You should eat more pizza. You like pizza.

468
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:05,205
Where is he? Why isn't he back yet?

469
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,545
My goodness.

470
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:15,255
Yoon Ah.

471
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:18,825
Such courage.

472
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:20,725
Yoon Ah.

473
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,925
Yoon Ah.

474
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:35,890
What are you doing here?

475
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,500
What? Actually...

476
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,545
Why are you wearing Yoon Ah's clothes?

477
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,615
What's going on?

478
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:46,845
Gosh, Sang Yeon.

479
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:48,810
What are you doing with my clothes?

480
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,910
Yoon Ah, this is all a misunderstanding.

481
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,880
Misunderstanding, my foot. We caught you in the act.

482
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,980
Sang Yeon, what's going on?

483
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,265
Well, I...

484
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,395
Actually, I...

485
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:06,265
I wanted to know your size.

486
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:09,270
I wanted to buy you a coat.

487
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,235
Your clothes are too old.

488
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:15,370
What did you say?

489
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,645
If you wanted to know her size, why didn't you ask her?

490
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:19,740
Besides,

491
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,485
you can check her size on the tag. Why would you try it on?

492
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:23,950
What if I asked her...

493
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:26,125
and she found out?

494
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:28,725
I couldn't ask her in case my pride got hurt.

495
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:31,150
Also, her clothes are so old...

496
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,060
that I couldn't read the tags.

497
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:35,695
That's why I tried it on, okay?

498
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:38,265
That was why.

499
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:39,720
We didn't know that.

500
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,690
Do you believe what he's saying?

501
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,260
How can a man try on a woman's clothes?

502
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,775
Why not?

503
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,000
I wear Seo Jin's clothes too.

504
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,400
Why would you?

505
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,945
Skirts can be comfortable.

506
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:54,500
That's why I wear her clothes sometimes.

507
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,055
What? Are you out of your mind?

508
00:22:58,255 --> 00:22:59,725
Anyway, I apologize.

509
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:04,055
I made you uncomfortable again.

510
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:07,265
I only had good intentions.

511
00:23:07,695 --> 00:23:09,365
I'll get going.

512
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,830
You smelled it.

513
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,475
- Sang Yeon. - He smelled it.

514
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,945
What's wrong with you? Gosh.

515
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:26,645
He definitely smelled it!

516
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:36,720
- Thank you for the ride. - Writer Bong.

517
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,080
Did you finish the movie that I gave you?

518
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,390
- Do you mean "Madame Freedom 2017"? - Yes.

519
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,695
I watched it a little.

520
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:44,860
She was very free.

521
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,835
Wasn't it good? Here.

522
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:49,105
Take a look at this.

523
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:53,260
It's a masterpiece in erotic movies.

524
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,705
I see.

525
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:56,470
Get home safely.

526
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,015
- Bye. - Goodbye.

527
00:24:00,745 --> 00:24:03,115
Why does he keep giving me these? I don't have a place to watch it.

528
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:05,355
What is it this time?

529
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:06,780
"Sweet Whip".

530
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,455
"The pleasure is unforgettable."

531
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:10,495
It's more erotic than before.

532
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:12,195
I'm afraid that someone will find out.

533
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:15,720
Sang Yeon, don't leave like this.

534
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,090
I apologize on his behalf.

535
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,390
It's okay.

536
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,920
I shouldn't stay here while he misunderstands.

537
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,690
Dong Gu, apologize to him.

538
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,590
What did I do wrong?

539
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,130
He's leaving because of you.

540
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,605
Are you seriously doing this?

541
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:39,225
Hold right there!

542
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:42,625
Isn't this women's underwear?

543
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:45,125
No, this is...

544
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:47,520
my underwear.

545
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:50,230
What? It belongs to you?

546
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:53,835
It's bright red, laced underwear.

547
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:59,075
Yes, I like this design.

548
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:02,145
It makes me feel at ease.

549
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:04,800
You're shameless.

550
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,580
How can you carry women's underwear in your pocket?

551
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:10,355
Why not?

552
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,510
When I feel bad at times...

553
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,755
Be quiet! Don't come near me!

554
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:16,720
Wait.

555
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,325
Tell me honestly.

556
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:20,450
Is this truly yours?

557
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,790
Yes.

558
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:23,965
I have them in every color at home.

559
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,065
Do you want to see them?

560
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:28,475
- Gosh... - Wait.

561
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:30,635
That looks like mine.

562
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:35,430
I'm right. It's mine.

563
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,915
Really?

564
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:40,100
What? No way.

565
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,310
That sexy, red, and laced underwear...

566
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:45,980
is not Yoon Ah's?

567
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,040
Is he crazy?

568
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,595
Darn it!

569
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,450
Why are you disappointed?

570
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,250
You said it was yours.

571
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,560
Why you...

572
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:56,695
Move. You're such a pervert.

573
00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:58,660
A pervert?

574
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,535
Aren't you being too harsh?

575
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:03,635
It's too uncomfortable to stay here any longer.

576
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:05,500
It wasn't Yoon Ah's...

577
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,345
- That jerk. - Where do you think you're going?

578
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:12,915
("Sweet Whip")

579
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:17,115
What's this?

580
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,795
"The pleasure is unforgettable."

581
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:25,065
"Sweet Whip"?

582
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:28,250
He's definitely a pervert.

583
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,320
No, I'm not. Besides, it isn't mine.

584
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,090
Then whose is it?

585
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,390
Whose is it?

586
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,330
It's not mine. Believe me.

587
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,075
Why you...

588
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:40,730
Call the police, Dong Gu.

589
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,770
Let's call the police.

590
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,740
Police? Wait a minute.

591
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:46,715
Fine, I'll be honest.

592
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:48,755
I stole the underwear.

593
00:26:49,515 --> 00:26:50,815
I admit it.

594
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:55,795
However, this CD isn't mine. Believe me.

595
00:26:55,895 --> 00:26:58,995
If this isn't yours, whose is it?

596
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:06,365
Tell them.

597
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:09,235
I saw you drop it.

598
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:15,875
Does it belong to Du Shik?

599
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:18,945
Don't you know how innocent he is?

600
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:22,110
He hasn't even held a woman's hand.

601
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,285
He's pure like a blank canvas.

602
00:27:24,655 --> 00:27:26,355
Why...

603
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:29,720
- I saw him drop it. - Shut your mouth!

604
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:31,480
Do you think I watch something like this?

605
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,950
Who do you think I am?

606
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,520
- I saw... - Shut your mouth.

607
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,420
Shut your mouth. You're dead meat.

608
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,520
You pervert. Come with me.

609
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,030
- This is unfair. It's not true. - You're dead meat.

610
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,630
- Du Shik. - Wait.

611
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:44,335
Let's go.

612
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:48,045
We need you to make the best scene.

613
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:50,975
Didn't I tell you?

614
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:55,370
I promised my parents that I wouldn't shoot any erotic scenes.

615
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,255
I just threw it out there.

616
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:08,695
I'm here.

617
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:11,395
You lost a lot of weight.

618
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:13,405
How much did you lose?

619
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:15,005
- 10kg. - What?

620
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:17,375
10kg.

621
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:19,360
10kg?

622
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,770
It must have been hard. Good job.

623
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,415
No, it was nothing.

624
00:28:30,215 --> 00:28:31,515
My goodness.

625
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,455
Be careful.

626
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:36,195
Jun Ki, it's okay. You're almost there.

627
00:28:36,755 --> 00:28:38,125
You can do it.

628
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:52,105
Hello.

629
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:56,075
I'm Lee Jun Ki. We'll be working together.

630
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:59,615
It's such an honor to meet you.

631
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:01,515
Is that so?

632
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:04,785
- It's nice to meet you. - Likewise...

633
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:08,355
Who are you?

634
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:12,095
Director.

635
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:14,565
Who is she?

636
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:17,150
She's the stand-in for Soo Jung.

637
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,435
Stand-in?

638
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:22,190
Wasn't she shooting it herself?

639
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,045
Did you think that you'd be shooting a bed scene with Soo Jung?

640
00:29:29,345 --> 00:29:31,145
Shin Soo Jung!

641
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:35,755
Bed scene!

642
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:39,555
What's wrong?

643
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:44,590
- Director. - Yes?

644
00:29:44,595 --> 00:29:46,595
Soo Jung just called.

645
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:50,020
She said that using a body double seems disrespectful to the audience.

646
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,535
She said that she'd do it herself.

647
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:56,775
Really? That's good for me too.

648
00:29:57,135 --> 00:30:00,130
You'll really shoot a bed scene with Soo Jung.

649
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,130
- Get ready. - I'll get ready soon.

650
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,270
Wait, Director.

651
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,815
What? What is it?

652
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:08,215
I'll do it.

653
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:17,850
Why did you change your mind?

654
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,650
I just changed my mind.

655
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,150
Why did you change your mind now?

656
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,890
Director, could you take him out?

657
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,135
- Hurry up. - Let's go.

658
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:30,190
It's because you want to shoot it with Soo Jung, right?

659
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,060
I know everything, you punk!

660
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,375
I worked so hard for it!

661
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:38,440
Didn't I tell you that he was strange?

662
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,100
The underwear was bad enough.

663
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,310
I was startled when he said the erotic DVD belonged to you.

664
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,015
- Don't you agree? - What?

665
00:30:44,215 --> 00:30:46,225
Yes, I agree.

666
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,280
I'm sorry for misunderstanding.

667
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,580
We thought that you were jealous because you like Yoon Ah.

668
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,595
How can I like Yoon Ah?

669
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,260
Jealous?

670
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,650
Goodness.

671
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,405
That's unbelievable.

672
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:02,175
Hey!

673
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:03,800
Isn't that Jun Ki?

674
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:05,330
Shouldn't he be at the shoot?

675
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,240
I know. Is he out of his mind?

676
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:08,975
Hey, Jun Ki.

677
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:10,645
- Jun Ki. - What's wrong with him?

678
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:12,515
Excuse me.

679
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:16,670
I'm in the same class as Yoon Ah.

680
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,185
Is she home?

681
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:20,780
Yes, but why are you looking for her?

682
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,555
I want to ask her out on a date.

683
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:27,295
On a date?

684
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:30,990
Do you know this?

685
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,330
Know what?

686
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,305
Yoon Ah is actually...

687
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,775
That jerk.

688
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:43,745
He took my role because Soo Jung was acting.

689
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:46,085
I worked so hard to lose weight.

690
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:51,915
Are you coming from class?

691
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,880
- Yes. - Is something wrong?

692
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:58,525
A strange rumor spread in class.

693
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:01,250
People say that I'm addicted to plastic surgery.

694
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,435
What? Addicted to plastic surgery?

695
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:05,465
Yes.

696
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:08,135
On top of that, I have a lot of debt and like to steal things.

697
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:10,375
They even say that I'm a man.

698
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:12,140
I was a marine.

699
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:14,675
I even cut barbed wires with my teeth.

700
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:18,985
Who would spread such a rumor?

701
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,085
I don't know.

702
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,380
People asked me sincerely.

703
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:25,955
Do they believe it?

704
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:30,995
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

705
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:36,865
Yes, it was me.

706
00:32:38,635 --> 00:32:40,835
I did it for your mom.

707
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,205
I was worried that she'd meet another pervert.

708
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:48,775
I'm serious.

709
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:50,575
Don't misunderstand.

710
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:00,755
It's also terrible this week.

711
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:03,410
Why aren't there any guests these days?

712
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,125
Is it because it's too cold?

713
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,165
What if we go out of business?

714
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:08,560
I know.

715
00:33:08,565 --> 00:33:11,495
The building owner called me about rent yesterday.

716
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:13,720
She even sent a contents-certified mail.

717
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,860
- It's okay. - Hi.

718
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,175
Hi.

719
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:21,560
Ma'am, what brings you here?

720
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,070
I'm here to collect rent.

721
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,445
Rent?

722
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:30,555
- Business isn't doing so well... - You have no money to pay?

723
00:33:31,315 --> 00:33:32,680
Please start.

724
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:34,280
- What? - Start what?

725
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:36,010
- Excuse me. - Do you need help?

726
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,810
Why are they running around?

727
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,880
I've seen this on TV.

728
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,090
- What's going on? - What? Seizure?

729
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,190
Seizure? No way.

730
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,460
- This isn't a drama. - What?

731
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,960
Are we out of business? What's going on?

732
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:50,475
Where's Dong Gu? Gosh.

733
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:52,175
Don't do that, sir.

734
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:55,915
(Marriage is an Insane Act)

735
00:33:57,845 --> 00:33:59,145
I'm home.

736
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:01,385
What are these red stickers?

737
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:04,885
- Ma'am. - Long time no see, Mr. Kang.

738
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,155
- Why do you have a baby? - Pardon?

739
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:12,690
It's because...

740
00:34:12,695 --> 00:34:14,065
It's Dong Gu's baby.

741
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,405
He got someone pregnant.

742
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:22,175
He got someone pregnant?

743
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:25,600
Are you saying that it's Mr. Kang's baby?

744
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,800
Yes. Now, we have...

745
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,400
another mouth to feed...

746
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,115
including diapers and baby formulas.

747
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:34,315
It costs so much to raise a baby.

748
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:39,325
We had money saved to pay rent,

749
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,925
but we used it all...

750
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:43,695
on the baby.

751
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:46,265
I see.

752
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:51,165
Where's the mother?

753
00:34:52,065 --> 00:34:53,335
The baby's mother?

754
00:34:54,265 --> 00:34:55,905
Her mom...

755
00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:59,005
- She's... - She ran away.

756
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:01,875
She couldn't stand living like this.

757
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:09,585
How could a mother do that?

758
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:13,920
You're right. We should move out if you insist.

759
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:16,695
However, if we live on the street,

760
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:20,325
we might be okay, but what about the baby?

761
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:22,235
This poor baby.

762
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:26,135
That's not our problem.

763
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:29,630
We'll evict them per law.

764
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,935
No, Attorney Kim.

765
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,905
I'll give you one month.

766
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:36,715
I'm being considerate of the baby,

767
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:38,130
so you must pay me back.

768
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,440
Really? Thank you, ma'am.

769
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,040
Thank you so much.

770
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,940
- Just take good care of the baby. - Okay.

771
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,255
Let's go, Attorney Kim.

772
00:35:49,095 --> 00:35:51,655
You poor thing.

773
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:55,125
Gosh.

774
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:57,020
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

775
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,065
- See you later. - Take care.

776
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:02,070
I thought we'd be kicked out.

777
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:04,690
How could you say such a lie?

778
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,860
What else could we do?

779
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,200
Don't you see the red stickers everywhere?

780
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:10,370
If we didn't lie, we'd be out on the streets.

781
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,270
What if she finds out the truth later?

782
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,440
She won't.

783
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,785
She won't look up Sol's resident registration.

784
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:17,655
What should we do?

785
00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:22,025
We're safe for this month, but what do we do next month?

786
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:24,155
It'll work out somehow.

787
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,425
It's okay.

788
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:30,090
Soo Ah.

789
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,450
Hey, Du Shik.

790
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,035
I haven't seen you in a while.

791
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:34,590
Have you been well?

792
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,470
I've been okay.

793
00:36:36,475 --> 00:36:38,005
Is Dong Gu well?

794
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:40,570
What? He's okay.

795
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,230
Why were you at a real estate agency?

796
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,570
I'm selling the house.

797
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,500
Yoon Seok is opening stores in the US. He invited me to join him.

798
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,940
How long will you stay there?

799
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,615
About 1 to 2 years.

800
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,155
Or we might stay there.

801
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:56,795
I have a lot to prepare, so I'll see you later.

802
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,510
- Take care. - Bye.

803
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,195
- Bye. - Bye.

804
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:04,630
What if she marries him?

805
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:05,890
I know.

806
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,490
If Dong Gu finds out, he'll be miserable. What do we do?

807
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,330
Don't tell him.

808
00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:12,375
Why would you tell him? He's getting over his breakup.

809
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:15,875
Is that the building owner's car?

810
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,215
I think so.

811
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,115
It seems like she's heading to our guesthouse.

812
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,115
Something doesn't feel right.

813
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:28,010
- I'm back. - You're back.

814
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,780
Has your wisdom tooth been removed?

815
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,955
Yes.

816
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:33,525
Wait.

817
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:36,465
What are those stickers?

818
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:39,335
Something happened.

819
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,265
We'll explain later.

820
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:44,835
- Does it hurt a lot? - No.

821
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:49,800
I just wish the bleeding would stop.

822
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,475
You can't do anything about it.

823
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:53,770
You'll have to put up with it for a day.

824
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,915
I see.

825
00:37:57,085 --> 00:37:58,655
I should probably change the gauze.

826
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,055
Where did we put it?

827
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,680
Let me see...

828
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,295
Welcome. Would you like to stay here?

829
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,765
I'm not a customer.

830
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,520
Who are you?

831
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,235
Me? I'm Han Yoon Ah.

832
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:18,230
Sol, what is it? Are you hungry?

833
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,875
Should Mommy feed you?

834
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:21,305
Mommy?

835
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:23,140
Are you her mom?

836
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:25,900
- Yes. - When did you come back?

837
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,570
Sorry?

838
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,640
I just came back from the hospital.

839
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,815
The hospital?

840
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:32,640
Why were you at the hospital?

841
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,610
For the past few days...

842
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,325
- No! - Wait!

843
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,525
Gosh.

844
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:42,020
Why did you have to yell?

845
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,120
I'm sorry.

846
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,035
What brings you here again?

847
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:50,560
I felt so sorry for the baby. I brought some diapers.

848
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,230
What's the noise?

849
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,030
- Ma'am. - Mr. Kang.

850
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,130
When did you find the baby's mom?

851
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,700
- Well... - The thing is...

852
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,870
By the way,

853
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,640
why was she at the hospital?

854
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,840
The hospital? Well...

855
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,910
We got a call from the hospital that she collapsed.

856
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,510
And we brought her here.

857
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,850
- That's what happened. - She collapsed?

858
00:39:10,855 --> 00:39:12,420
What is the problem?

859
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:14,625
What? I just...

860
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:17,295
You're bleeding.

861
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:20,635
Gosh, not again.

862
00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:25,833
Seo Jin. Hurry.

863
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,301
Take her to the room.

864
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:28,803
- Okay. - Hurry.

865
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:30,271
- Let me take you to the room. - Hurry.

866
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:31,872
- I'm... - Go.

867
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,041
- Go to the room. - You need rest.

868
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,977
- You're coughing up blood. - Get some rest.

869
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:38,646
I mean...

870
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:41,616
What is the problem? Why would she cough up blood?

871
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,651
Well...

872
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:45,720
I should do something.

873
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,388
- Let me take her to the hospital. - No.

874
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:49,357
- What? - Well...

875
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:52,093
The doctor said that there's nothing they can do.

876
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,794
That's why we brought her here.

877
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,965
Do you mean she can't be cured?

878
00:39:57,965 --> 00:39:59,233
What?

879
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:01,802
That's right.

880
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:04,305
Is she a terminal patient?

881
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:07,108
Yes.

882
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:11,245
But she's so young.

883
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:15,583
It must be hard for you.

884
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:18,252
Me? Yes.

885
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:20,087
Be nice to her.

886
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:22,757
- I will. - Make her last days happy.

887
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,461
By the way, did you have a wedding?

888
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,830
A wedding? Well...

889
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,998
Then again,

890
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,934
you must not have had time for it.

891
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:38,205
I feel so sorry for her.

892
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:41,776
She'll never get to wear a wedding dress.

893
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:47,114
Gosh.

894
00:40:47,915 --> 00:40:50,918
Stay strong, Mr. Kang.

895
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:54,055
I will. Thank you.

896
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:00,695
I'll be going now.

897
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:02,596
This way.

898
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:07,101
Thank you for the diapers. Bye.

899
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:08,402
Bye.

900
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:13,741
Gosh, that was close.

901
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:15,543
Why did you have to lie?

902
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:16,811
We almost got caught.

903
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:19,513
But we didn't. Everything will be all right.

904
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:20,781
Don't worry.

905
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:21,882
What if she finds out?

906
00:41:21,882 --> 00:41:23,217
Let me carry the diapers.

907
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:25,286
- That was close. - Are we taking them?

908
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:26,854
My goodness.

909
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,325
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

910
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:33,894
What do you think?

911
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:36,063
What's this?

912
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:39,767
I'd like to hold a wedding for you two.

913
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,102
- Sorry? - Sorry?

914
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:42,203
- A wedding? - A wedding?

915
00:41:42,203 --> 00:41:44,605
Don't worry. I'll pay for it.

916
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,273
You don't have to do this.

917
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:47,441
We're really okay.

918
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:50,144
You don't understand women.

919
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:52,580
Women dream of wearing a wedding dress...

920
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,081
all their lives.

921
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,683
That's not true.

922
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:57,752
I'm really okay even if I don't get to wear one.

923
00:41:57,752 --> 00:42:00,387
I insist. Do it for my sake.

924
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:04,592
The thing is, my husband and I never had a wedding...

925
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:06,894
because of our circumstances.

926
00:42:06,894 --> 00:42:09,497
I never got to wear a wedding dress either.

927
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:12,199
I see.

928
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,136
That's why I know how you feel.

929
00:42:15,503 --> 00:42:18,706
So don't worry about anything. I want you to have a wedding.

930
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:22,676
No. We're really fine.

931
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:25,146
Are you going to ignore my kindness?

932
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:27,148
Forget it.

933
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,884
- But then, you have to move out. - Sorry?

934
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:32,553
- What are you talking about? - Make up your mind.

935
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:35,356
Have a wedding or move out.

936
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:41,862
We'll do it.

937
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:43,898
We'll have a wedding.

938
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:46,233
Now, we're talking.

939
00:42:46,534 --> 00:42:49,370
I guess we should have it as soon as possible.

940
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,605
- What? - What about this Sunday?

941
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:53,908
This Sunday?

942
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:58,746
We don't know how much time the girl has.

943
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:04,685
Well, okay.

944
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:07,655
What? She's going to hold a wedding for you two?

945
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:09,056
Yes.

946
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:11,692
It's all because of your lie.

947
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,561
I didn't know this would happen.

948
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:15,329
This is not okay.

949
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:17,064
This is a fraud.

950
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,533
I'll go to her and tell her the truth.

951
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:21,101
Hey, wait!

952
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:22,369
- What? - Are you crazy?

953
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:24,038
Don't you know what she's like?

954
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:25,472
If she finds out that we lied to her,

955
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:28,142
she'll not only kick us out but sue us.

956
00:43:28,142 --> 00:43:29,944
Then what am I supposed to do?

957
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,950
Dong Gu, I'm sorry,

958
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,285
but can't you just bite the bullet...

959
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:39,653
and have a wedding?

960
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,488
- Jun Ki. - Are you crazy?

961
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,091
Then what can we do?

962
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:47,328
We can't end up on the streets in this cold weather.

963
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,435
You and Yoon Ah...

964
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:56,904
Just do it.

965
00:43:56,904 --> 00:43:59,173
Gosh, stop it!

966
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:03,043
We really don't need rings.

967
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,311
- We're okay. - We're really okay.

968
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,780
I insist.

969
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,215
Pick one.

970
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:12,887
Wait. Dong Gu.

971
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:16,357
Sang Pil.

972
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:21,929
It's been a long time. How have you been?

973
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:24,064
I've been well.

974
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:26,567
Who is she?

975
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:28,602
Well...

976
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:30,004
Is she your girlfriend?

977
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:32,473
Well... She is...

978
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:34,675
What about these for your wedding rings?

979
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,877
They're the most popular ones these days.

980
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:39,046
Wedding rings?

981
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,916
Wait. Are you getting married?

982
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:44,585
Well...

983
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:50,791
Yes. I'm getting married.

984
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,227
Why haven't you told me? When is the wedding?

985
00:44:53,594 --> 00:44:55,362
Well...

986
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,400
This Sunday.

987
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,303
You should have told me.

988
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:04,271
Don't worry.

989
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:06,941
I'll bring the whole department...

990
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:09,677
and the whole club to your wedding.

991
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:12,413
Congratulations, Dong Gu.

992
00:45:12,513 --> 00:45:15,716
Yes, well... Thank you.

993
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,586
Thank you so much, you punk.

994
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:22,723
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

995
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:25,559
Why did I have to run into Sang Pil there?

996
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:26,560
Gosh, Sang Pil...

997
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,828
Sergeant Kang?

998
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:31,966
- Corporal Kim. - Salute.

999
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:34,301
How have you been?

1000
00:45:34,301 --> 00:45:35,669
I've been well.

1001
00:45:35,669 --> 00:45:36,870
It's been a long time.

1002
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,839
Mr. Kang, what about this?

1003
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:42,142
You should wear a tuxedo for the wedding, shouldn't you?

1004
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:44,244
- Well... - Wedding?

1005
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:46,246
Are you getting married?

1006
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,916
Well...

1007
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,253
Yes, I'm getting married.

1008
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:54,621
What? When?

1009
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:56,724
- This Sunday. - This Sunday?

1010
00:45:56,724 --> 00:45:59,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I'm disappointed.

1011
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,929
Don't be.

1012
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:03,931
He had his reasons.

1013
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,265
Reasons?

1014
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:07,167
What do you mean?

1015
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:11,238
What?

1016
00:46:11,805 --> 00:46:14,274
My goodness. That's terrible.

1017
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:15,909
Stay strong, Sergeant Kang.

1018
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,945
I will. Thank you.

1019
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:20,614
You are doing a great thing.

1020
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,282
That's such a beautiful story.

1021
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:24,184
That's not a big deal.

1022
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:27,921
I just want them to be happy.

1023
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:31,859
Anyway, I'll contact everyone...

1024
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:33,193
in our platoon.

1025
00:46:33,193 --> 00:46:35,696
It's okay. You really don't have to do that.

1026
00:46:35,696 --> 00:46:38,332
We should be together during such a hard time like this.

1027
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:40,000
That's comradeship.

1028
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,835
- Don't you agree? - Yes!

1029
00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:46,940
I see. Thank you.

1030
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,777
What a big sense of comradeship.

1031
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:55,716
This is annoying.

1032
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:57,384
Wedding, my foot.

1033
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:07,361
How can you laugh in this kind of situation?

1034
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:09,396
It's just really interesting.

1035
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:10,864
What is?

1036
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:13,434
When I was young, I thought about...

1037
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:17,471
my wedding a lot. Where I'd do it and what dress I'd wear.

1038
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:19,006
I even thought about what kind of bouquet I'd hold.

1039
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:22,009
But I gave everything up after having Sol.

1040
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:24,745
But I'm actually having a wedding now.

1041
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:31,652
Walking around all day is quite tiring, right?

1042
00:47:31,652 --> 00:47:33,187
I don't know.

1043
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:36,457
I don't know if I'm tired or not. Everything was confusing.

1044
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:39,326
I wish this was a dream.

1045
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:44,364
Yoon Ah, it's not too late to tell the truth.

1046
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,468
Did she fall asleep already?

1047
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:49,203
Really?

1048
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:53,474
She's such a laid-back lady.

1049
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:56,176
Look at that.

1050
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:58,078
I don't even...

1051
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:17,564
(Ledia)

1052
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,543
Oh, well...

1053
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:34,715
She's such a needy person.

1054
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:42,122
We are back.

1055
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:45,526
The groom is here!

1056
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:49,396
I was joking.

1057
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,899
You didn't seem to feel good. I wanted to make you feel better.

1058
00:48:51,899 --> 00:48:53,000
How can you joke?

1059
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,035
Do you have any idea what I had to go through?

1060
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:58,438
Do you know what's going on because of you?

1061
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:00,374
Wait, what is this?

1062
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:01,909
Isn't this the owner?

1063
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:03,010
What about her?

1064
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,578
There's an article about her on the main page.

1065
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:06,313
An article? What article is that?

1066
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:09,483
"Her good deed is melting everyone's heart in this cold weather."

1067
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:12,219
"She decided to pay for a wedding of Kang Dong Gu and Han Yoon Ah."

1068
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,954
"They are running a guesthouse in Huam..."

1069
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:15,656
"without being able to pay rent."

1070
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:18,358
Who wrote this?

1071
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:20,027
Who wrote this article?

1072
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:22,429
Kim Tae Yong? That's...

1073
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:23,797
I'm a journalist these days.

1074
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,132
Corporal Kim? What?

1075
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:27,434
What on earth was he thinking?

1076
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:29,303
Why didn't he write the article he needed to write?

1077
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:30,904
Hello, this is Waikiki Guesthouse.

1078
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:32,272
Hello?

1079
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:34,575
Hello, this is Whee Sung, the singer.

1080
00:49:34,575 --> 00:49:37,544
- What? Whee Sung, the singer? - Whee Sung?

1081
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:40,113
- It must be a joke. - No, this is me, Whee Sung.

1082
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:42,282
- I'm not lying. - Oh, really?

1083
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:44,885
- Hello, this is Park Hyo Shin. - What?

1084
00:49:44,952 --> 00:49:47,154
Do you want to have a battle of cow-like singing with me?

1085
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:50,157
You are such a nice person

1086
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:52,993
Even though we break up

1087
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,861
Stop the prank calls.

1088
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:58,465
I even thought about marrying you

1089
00:50:01,935 --> 00:50:04,204
That does sound like him. What made you call us?

1090
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:06,506
You read the article?

1091
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:12,613
What? You want to sing at their wedding?

1092
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:15,349
- Is that actually Whee Sung? - Whee Sung, could you...

1093
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,084
wait a bit, please? Someone's calling us.

1094
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:18,885
Hello, this is Waikiki Guesthouse.

1095
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:21,221
Park Sul Nyeo?

1096
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:22,856
- What? - What?

1097
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:24,891
You want to make them hanboks?

1098
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:27,394
Things are becoming bigger and bigger.

1099
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:28,895
If this gets caught,

1100
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:31,064
we cannot live in Korea anymore.

1101
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:33,066
People will beat us to death.

1102
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:35,335
Who? Chef Lee Yeon Bok?

1103
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:45,812
(We don't take congratulatory money.)

1104
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:49,816
(Women's Association of the Huam district)

1105
00:50:49,816 --> 00:50:50,884
(The 44th mechanized infantry)

1106
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:52,152
- Dong Gu! - Dong Gu!

1107
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:54,121
- Congratulations! - You are getting married.

1108
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,289
Thank you so much.

1109
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:56,690
- You really brought everyone. - Yes.

1110
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,225
- I did bring everyone. - Congratulations!

1111
00:50:58,225 --> 00:50:59,493
Thank you.

1112
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,129
- Congratulations! - Thanks!

1113
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:03,630
- Thank you. - Congratulations!

1114
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,831
- Thank you! - No problem.

1115
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:06,600
What?

1116
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:08,435
Let's cheer up the groom.

1117
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:10,537
Salute the new groom!

1118
00:51:10,537 --> 00:51:12,039
- Salute! - Salute!

1119
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,273
- Rest! - Salute.

1120
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:14,775
Sergeant Kang.

1121
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:16,209
Corporal Kim.

1122
00:51:16,643 --> 00:51:18,211
I read the article.

1123
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:19,579
- Congratulations! - Thanks.

1124
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:22,349
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

1125
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,985
- You are the new groom! - You are so handsome.

1126
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:26,820
- Your daughter's adorable. - I...

1127
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:29,589
- We'll be at the ceremonial hall! - Thanks.

1128
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:34,695
Are you okay, Dong Gu?

1129
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:36,463
Do I look okay to you?

1130
00:51:36,863 --> 00:51:39,966
Friends back in school, professors, and even the commander...

1131
00:51:39,966 --> 00:51:42,502
Even the leader of the women's association is here.

1132
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:45,572
I'm officially married. I'm a married man.

1133
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:48,208
But everyone's complimenting about how beautiful your bride is.

1134
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,577
That's right. You didn't see Yoon Ah in her dress yet, right?

1135
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,447
She looks amazing. She's gorgeous.

1136
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:54,848
So what?

1137
00:51:54,848 --> 00:51:56,717
Do I have to be happy because I have a beautiful bride?

1138
00:51:57,784 --> 00:52:01,421
I don't even know what to do because of how happy I am.

1139
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:03,523
- Calm down. - Do you think I can?

1140
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:04,691
It's all because of you.

1141
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:06,226
You are not even my friend.

1142
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:08,695
- You are my enemy. - What are you guys doing?

1143
00:52:09,529 --> 00:52:11,865
It's time to begin the ceremony.

1144
00:52:12,065 --> 00:52:13,433
Come in!

1145
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:16,002
- Of course. - Right, it's time to begin.

1146
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,004
I have to go now.

1147
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:19,439
- I'll be there. - See you soon.

1148
00:52:19,439 --> 00:52:21,041
Are you really going?

1149
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:22,342
Good luck!

1150
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:30,384
It's time to begin...

1151
00:52:30,684 --> 00:52:33,520
Kang Dong Gu...

1152
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,023
and Han Yoon Ah's...

1153
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,259
wedding ceremony.

1154
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:41,995
Here comes the groom!

1155
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:53,173
- Dong Gu! - Congratulations!

1156
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:54,474
Dong Gu!

1157
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,710
That's my boy!

1158
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,012
He's handsome!

1159
00:52:59,212 --> 00:53:00,714
Look how happy he is.

1160
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,950
Look how spirited the groom is!

1161
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,557
All right.

1162
00:53:10,557 --> 00:53:13,760
It's time to meet the star of today.

1163
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:15,495
The bride of February,

1164
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:19,733
Han Yoon Ah! Please applaud for her!

1165
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:22,602
Here comes the bride!

1166
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,930
She's beautiful!

1167
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:04,578
Salute to the bride!

1168
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:06,213
- Salute! - Salute!

1169
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:07,614
Rest!

1170
00:54:11,284 --> 00:54:13,286
The bride is here.

1171
00:54:26,032 --> 00:54:28,401
Dong Gu, Dong Gu!

1172
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,637
Kang Dong Gu!

1173
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:45,018
Love is delicious

1174
00:54:45,018 --> 00:54:46,753
It's bathed in moonlight

1175
00:54:46,753 --> 00:54:48,688
You split it in half

1176
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:52,058
And you share it with each other

1177
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:54,561
Always keep that

1178
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:56,763
In mind

1179
00:54:56,763 --> 00:55:00,467
And be together forever

1180
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:04,538
Thank you.

1181
00:55:04,538 --> 00:55:05,639
Whee Sung!

1182
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,807
Congratulations on your wedding.

1183
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:10,076
I really hope you two will live happily ever after.

1184
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:12,946
I'm actually quite expensive.

1185
00:55:12,946 --> 00:55:14,948
But I sang for free today.

1186
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:18,151
To make up for that, I'd like them...

1187
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,855
to give each other a passionate kiss.

1188
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:26,693
- You want us to kiss? - A passionate kiss.

1189
00:55:27,093 --> 00:55:28,495
Don't be shy.

1190
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,830
All right. Kiss!

1191
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:37,370
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1192
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,005
I think I'll go crazy.

1193
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:41,408
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1194
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:43,243
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1195
00:55:43,243 --> 00:55:45,145
- Kiss! - Hurry, and kiss the bride!

1196
00:55:45,145 --> 00:55:49,683
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1197
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,518
Dong Gu. Let's just do it.

1198
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:54,254
- Do what? - Let's just go ahead and kiss.

1199
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:56,456
How could we possibly kiss in front of everyone?

1200
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,591
Enjoy your honeymoon.

1201
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:33,593
Take this,

1202
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,563
and buy Yoon Ah whatever she wants.

1203
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:39,232
I will. Thank you.

1204
00:56:39,232 --> 00:56:40,834
Go on in.

1205
00:56:42,002 --> 00:56:43,436
Have a safe trip.

1206
00:56:44,037 --> 00:56:46,373
We'll see you when we get back.

1207
00:56:46,773 --> 00:56:48,775
Shall we get going, Yoon Ah?

1208
00:56:49,175 --> 00:56:50,543
I mean, honey?

1209
00:56:51,678 --> 00:56:52,912
Pardon?

1210
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,714
Yes, let's go,

1211
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:56,516
honey.

1212
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:09,129
Goodbye.

1213
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:20,373
Dong Gu.

1214
00:57:28,715 --> 00:57:29,983
Dong Gu?

1215
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:32,786
- Dong Gu. - What?

1216
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:34,020
What is it? Why?

1217
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,922
What are you thinking about for so long?

1218
00:57:35,922 --> 00:57:37,090
What?

1219
00:57:38,058 --> 00:57:39,559
I wasn't thinking about anything.

1220
00:57:42,028 --> 00:57:45,799
Anyway, how long do we have to stay here like this?

1221
00:57:47,267 --> 00:57:49,836
The guys said they'd let us know when the owner leaves the airport.

1222
00:57:49,836 --> 00:57:51,604
Let's wait a bit longer and then leave.

1223
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:54,874
Mr. Kang.

1224
00:57:56,609 --> 00:57:59,079
- Attorney Kim. - What brings you here?

1225
00:57:59,713 --> 00:58:01,715
You two must be going on your honeymoon.

1226
00:58:01,715 --> 00:58:03,817
Pardon? Yes, that's right.

1227
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:06,252
That's right. You said you're going to Jeju Island, right?

1228
00:58:06,286 --> 00:58:08,521
I'm just on my way to Jeju Island myself on a business trip.

1229
00:58:08,521 --> 00:58:09,856
What time is your flight?

1230
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,593
We're taking the 6:30pm flight.

1231
00:58:13,593 --> 00:58:15,962
I'm taking the 6:30pm flight also.

1232
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:18,098
It's the same flight.

1233
00:58:18,098 --> 00:58:21,167
Our seats are even next to each other. This is amazing.

1234
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:23,269
It's time. Let's go.

1235
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:24,738
All right.

1236
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:26,706
Dong Gu. What should we do?

1237
00:58:26,706 --> 00:58:29,209
I don't know. This is driving me crazy.

1238
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:30,376
Hurry. Let's go.

1239
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:40,787
I'm sure their flight has arrived by now.

1240
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:45,291
I hope she was in good condition and enjoyed the trip.

1241
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:50,330
What is this? What's this squishy and disturbing feeling?

1242
00:58:51,765 --> 00:58:53,099
My goodness.

1243
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:55,735
Why on earth did a dog have to poop here?

1244
00:58:55,735 --> 00:58:57,170
Gosh. This is disgusting.

1245
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:02,375
The house seems empty without those two.

1246
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:04,010
I agree.

1247
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:06,846
Dong Gu and Yoon Ah should be home soon. Shouldn't we go meet them?

1248
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:08,047
There's no need.

1249
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:10,416
It wasn't even a real honeymoon. Why should we go see them arrive?

1250
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:13,286
Why did they have to meet Attorney Kim right then?

1251
00:59:13,286 --> 00:59:14,521
I know.

1252
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,089
What if...

1253
00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:18,291
Dong Gu and Yoon Ah really grow fond of each other?

1254
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:19,526
I doubt that.

1255
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:22,162
Anyway, it's a relief the owner didn't find out.

1256
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:24,030
Speaking of the owner,

1257
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,399
how could she believe that Dong Gu and Yoon Ah were a couple?

1258
00:59:26,399 --> 00:59:27,901
Who would have imagined?

1259
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:32,071
- What is that supposed to mean? - My goodness!

1260
00:59:32,572 --> 00:59:33,706
Ma'am.

1261
00:59:33,706 --> 00:59:36,342
If they're not a couple, what are they?

1262
00:59:38,378 --> 00:59:40,280
You don't mean to say...

1263
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,481
you lied to me, do you?

1264
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:42,849
You see, let me explain.

1265
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:44,551
Tell me the truth this instant!

1266
00:59:44,551 --> 00:59:47,987
- Oh, dear. - Please calm down.

1267
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:50,056
(Memorandum of Payment)

1268
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:53,426
Please forgive us. We didn't mean for this to happen.

1269
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:56,429
Shut your mouth, and just sign with your thumbprint.

1270
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:00,066
What is this?

1271
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:02,635
It's a memorandum of payment concerning the wedding expenses.

1272
01:00:02,635 --> 01:00:04,370
If you fail to repay the expenses within a month,

1273
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,606
it states that something horrible could happen to you.

1274
01:00:06,606 --> 01:00:08,041
Consider it as a kind warning.

1275
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:10,577
What would you mean by something horrible?

1276
01:00:10,577 --> 01:00:12,412
Calculate the expenses times one hundred.

1277
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:16,049
It would be your worst nightmare.

1278
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:20,854
I would put you all in jail if I could,

1279
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:27,093
but I'm being generous for the baby's sake.

1280
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,429
Sign with your thumbprint this instant.

1281
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:32,031
How could we possibly arrange this large amount...

1282
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:33,867
of money within just one month?

1283
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:36,703
Then would you prefer going to jail?

1284
01:00:38,304 --> 01:00:39,939
Should I sign here?

1285
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:45,211
(Recognizer: Kang Dong Gu)

1286
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:56,723
What do we do now?

1287
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:00,193
We don't have guests, and now, we're in debt.

1288
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:02,028
How am I supposed to know?

1289
01:01:03,396 --> 01:01:06,032
This is all that jerk, Jun Ki's fault.

1290
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:09,836
I'll teach that jerk a lesson when I get home.

1291
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:24,918
That startled me!

1292
01:01:25,485 --> 01:01:28,354
That person could've caused an accident by driving that fast.

1293
01:01:43,102 --> 01:01:44,304
Dong Gu?

1294
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:46,873
Dong Gu.

1295
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:49,742
Can't you hear me?

1296
01:01:51,644 --> 01:01:53,513
Can't you hear me?

1297
01:01:56,316 --> 01:01:59,819
What was that? What did you say?

1298
01:02:00,353 --> 01:02:02,789
I just thanked you.

1299
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:04,757
So...

1300
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:08,528
that's exactly why you should watch carefully where you're going.

1301
01:02:09,529 --> 01:02:12,365
You sure are a nuisance.

1302
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:14,334
Step aside.

1303
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:18,738
Why don't you just walk with your eyes closed?

1304
01:02:20,873 --> 01:02:22,742
Wait for me, Dong Gu.

1305
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:33,686
Soo Ah.

1306
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,658
Dong Gu.

1307
01:02:42,195 --> 01:02:43,396
What...

1308
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,599
are you doing here like this?

1309
01:02:46,766 --> 01:02:48,034
Did something happen?

1310
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:56,009
What should I do, Dong Gu?

1311
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:40,620
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1312
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,321
I can't burden Dong Gu any longer.

1313
01:03:42,321 --> 01:03:44,090
How much longer do I have to stay here?

1314
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,691
- Did you pay the additional fee? - Pardon?

1315
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:47,593
Hey. Stop right there!

1316
01:03:48,728 --> 01:03:51,164
I could help an ex-girlfriend, can't I?

1317
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:52,198
Soo Ah. Take this.

1318
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:53,699
- What's this all of a sudden? - It just seemed nice.

1319
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:54,934
You still have feelings for Soo Ah, don't you?

1320
01:03:54,934 --> 01:03:56,302
You didn't get the wrong idea, did you?

1321
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:58,671
Why would I? Take good care of Soo Ah.

1322
01:03:58,671 --> 01:04:01,007
What's with the album. Who's that? Why are there hearts drawn on her?

1323
01:04:01,007 --> 01:04:02,542
- She's my first love. - How did you meet her?

1324
01:04:02,542 --> 01:04:04,510
As an erotic movie writer and an erotic movie actress.

1325
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:07,713
Jun Ki. I was you who asked for this.

1326
01:04:07,713 --> 01:04:09,615
Please don't hate me for this.

1327
01:04:09,615 --> 01:04:10,783
It's me, your lifesaver, Jun Ki.

1328
01:04:10,783 --> 01:04:12,285
By the way, do you have any extra money?

1329
01:04:12,285 --> 01:04:13,653
I'm going to start an eating show.

1330
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:14,954
I have to pay my credit bills.

1331
01:04:14,954 --> 01:04:16,355
Eating shows aren't as easy as you think.

1332
01:04:16,355 --> 01:04:18,191
If I eat the bones, I get one hundred stars?

1333
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:19,826
Please prepare him for a thorough medical checkup.

1334
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:21,194
Is it bad?
