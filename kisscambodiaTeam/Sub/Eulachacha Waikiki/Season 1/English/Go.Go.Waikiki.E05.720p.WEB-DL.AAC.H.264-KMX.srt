<i>[This program is suitable

3
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:13,580
Seo Jin, you should get up now.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,370
You haven't eaten in days.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,797
Yeah, it's not the first
interview you've failed

6
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:20,495
so how long are you
going to keep this up?

7
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:22,387
I'm fine. Just leave.

8
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:26,196
Who told you to slap the interviewer
with the meat, girl?

9
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:27,865
She says he was sexually harassing her.

10
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:30,867
Still, does it make sense to slap him?

11
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,076
With meat, at that?

12
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:33,896
You and that temper of yours.

13
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:35,234
That's enough!

14
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,966
You scared me.
Why are you screaming?

15
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:40,472
Also, would you please shave, Seo Jin?

16
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:43,164
What if our guests see you?

17
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,442
Are you crying?

18
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:52,500
Do you know how much
I wanted to work there?

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,805
Ever since I decided to become a reporter

20
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,570
it was my goal to work there.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,991
You can't even comfort me
and you're picking on me.

22
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:02,316
That's not what I meant.

23
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,126
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:06,621
Don't cry. You'll get a job next time.

25
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:09,631
Forget it. I have a bad temper.

26
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:13,039
I can't control my feelings.

27
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,350
Becoming a reporter and getting a job...

28
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,730
I'm going to give up on all of it.

29
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,790
What, give up?

30
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,457
Hey, Kang Seo Jin!

31
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:22,757
Does it make sense to give up
on your dream over this?

32
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:25,868
You're acting so pathetic.
The Kang family--

33
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:29,299
Yes, I'm pathetic!
That's why I'm giving up!

34
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,296
I didn't say much.

35
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,588
Seriously, man.

36
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:39,924
Read the mood in the room, would you?

37
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:42,805
- It's not the time for that.
- You have no sense.

38
00:01:42,805 --> 00:01:45,680
Seo Jin, eat first and sleep.

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,100
I don't want to.

40
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:53,635
<i>[You Are Not the Problem!]</i>

41
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:56,576
How is Seo Jin doing? Did she eat?

42
00:01:56,576 --> 00:02:00,076
No, she won't even leave her room
and she keeps crying.

43
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:02,079
Gosh, this is a big problem.

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,995
Isn't there a way
to make Seo Jin feel better?

45
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:07,521
Ah, Seo Jin likes to eat chicken feet.

46
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,078
Should we go eat chicken feet tonight?

47
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:11,716
Do you really think that would
make her feel better?

48
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:16,097
What Seo Jin needs right now is
sincere consoling, not chicken feet.

49
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:17,106
Consoling?

50
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:19,209
Saying things like,
"Pain is a part of youth."

51
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,097
Those things are so cheesy
that I can't say them.

52
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,794
Don't you agree, Yoon Ah?

53
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:26,955
Yoon Ah...

54
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,836
I wonder how much you need
to set up a store like this?

55
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:37,704
You would need a ton of money.

56
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:39,110
You want to open a bakery?

57
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,246
You sure have a big dream of
becoming a patisseur or whatever it is.

58
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,395
Did I say that?

59
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:45,873
I was just talking to myself.
Can't I even talk to myself?

60
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:47,215
I realized that you have no sense

61
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:49,252
when it comes to reading
the mood of a situation.

62
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,421
What did I do?

63
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,512
I only said one thing.

64
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,555
Gosh, why are you
getting irritated with me?

65
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:57,694
When did I? I have never gotten
irritated with anyone in my life.

66
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,441
You are right now.

67
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,951
When did I? When?

68
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:02,790
You are getting
irritated with me right now.

69
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,974
Don't you know the meaning of the word?

70
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,590
Hey, what are you doing here?

71
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,378
Are you having a couple's argument?

72
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:13,128
Don't be ridiculous.
What's with that car?

73
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:17,317
I'm starting my drama soon,
so I got myself a car.

74
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:19,735
It's not even a great role.
Why would you buy a car?

75
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:22,860
Be quiet and get in.
It's cold, so I'll drive you home.

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,866
My goodness.

77
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,448
<i>Rebecca!</i>

78
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:31,953
Welcome.

79
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,663
How old is this thing? Does it even work?

80
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:35,715
Of course.

81
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,068
Rebecca drives much better
than she looks.

82
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:41,883
All right, we'll get going then.

83
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:47,132
Oh, Rebecca...

84
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:50,061
What happened?
Did the engine just shut off?

85
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:54,528
It's okay, it's okay.
I can start the engine again.

86
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:02,390
- What's this?
- It's okay, it's okay.

87
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,716
I can sew the seat belt back on.

88
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,069
This car...

89
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,156
It's okay, it's okay.

90
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,661
What do you mean it's okay?
I want to get out.

91
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,002
What? This isn't opening.
It's not working.

92
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,132
It only opens from the outside.

93
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,576
What?

94
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,483
It's okay, it's okay.

95
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:24,129
I can get out and open it for you
from the outside.

96
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,730
- Open it right now.
- Hey, Rebecca!

97
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,649
What is this? Why is it falling off?

98
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:31,557
Leave Rebecca alone.

99
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:32,658
I can see its insides.

100
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,678
Rebecca is a transparent friend.

101
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:36,410
Was this car assembled properly?

102
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,057
It worked. Okay, we'll get going now.

103
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,831
<i>Rebecca! My Rebecca!</i>

104
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:58,247
- What's wrong, Dong Gu?
- I nearly died.

105
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,995
See if I ride in that Rebecca ever again.

106
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:03,369
What kind of a man is so full of fear?

107
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,065
It's okay, it's okay.

108
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:06,223
Stop that.

109
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,538
Doo Shik, give Sol to me.
Thanks for watching her.

110
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:09,572
Let's go to Mommy.

111
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:12,833
Sol, I missed you.
I missed you so much.

112
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,127
I missed you too, Sol.

113
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:16,278
What are you doing?

114
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:17,591
<i>[President is Bruce Lee]</i>

115
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,862
You're faking your views again.

116
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,014
Everyone else does it too.

117
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,494
Why are they so low lately?
It's driving me insane.

118
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:26,932
Because your writing is darn boring.

119
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,204
Why is it boring?

120
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,293
Doo Shik is a good writer.

121
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:31,312
Good writer?

122
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:34,350
You haven't read his latest
web novel, have you?

123
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,458
Listen up.

124
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,992
The president is kidnapped by aliens.

125
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:41,132
The president then shoots a powerful
wind from his hands and kills the aliens.

126
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,220
But guess who that president is.

127
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,877
The American president.

128
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,377
There's a detailed explanation
that the president

129
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:49,706
is a reincarnation of Bruce Lee.

130
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:50,805
You see that?

131
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,802
Does it make sense for Bruce Lee
to shoot strong winds?

132
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:54,237
Fine. Look down on me.

133
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:57,901
For that, I won't write a role for you
in my work when I do succeed.

134
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,262
Okay. Thank you.

135
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:00,334
Move!

136
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:04,072
- Doo Shik.
- He's angry again. Look at him.

137
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,440
Give it a rest, would you?

138
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,658
What is this book?

139
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,689
"Project to console youths."

140
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:15,055
"Falling is not failure.
Failure is the inability to get back up."

141
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:17,586
The words are nice.

142
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,920
It's so cheesy.

143
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,028
What kind of book title is so cheesy?

144
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:23,713
Do they think those words
make someone feel better?

145
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:25,665
I really wonder.

146
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,435
I'm so hungry.
I think I'll make some ramen.

147
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:31,023
- One for me too.
- Then I'll make two.

148
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,822
You scared me!

149
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,622
- Hey.
- Seo Jin.

150
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:40,052
Hey.

151
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,579
- Seo Jin.
- Kang Seo Jin.

152
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,949
Hey, how long is she
going to keep that up?

153
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,079
I don't know.
I'm worried something will happen to her.

154
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,985
Yoon Ah.

155
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:57,675
Can you take Seo Jin out
and go get some air?

156
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:59,413
And console her or something?

157
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,064
What? Me?

158
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:02,788
Remember what you said earlier?

159
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:06,952
Seo Jin needs sincere consoling
or something like that.

160
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:09,581
I'm asking you for this favor, please?

161
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:13,052
- All right. I'll try.
- Okay.

162
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:14,526
Wait and see.

163
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:17,353
I'll succeed no matter what
and get revenge.

164
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,052
- Lee Joon Ki!
- Hey, you.

165
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:22,163
Didn't I tell you not to do
other things during work?

166
00:07:22,163 --> 00:07:23,781
Sorry, sorry.

167
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:27,642
If you have nothing to do,
go put this in my house laundry.

168
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:31,862
Our house entry code is 48914, okay?

169
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:34,862
All right, just let go of me.

170
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,463
When are you hiring
the other part-time employee?

171
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:41,803
I already hired someone,
so stop whining.

172
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,038
Here she is.

173
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:53,088
Say hello.

174
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:55,536
She'll be starting today.
This is Kim Sun Woo.

175
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:57,149
She's my daughter.

176
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:59,899
- What?
- Why are you so shocked?

177
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,168
Hello.

178
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:03,927
So, don't be hard on her.

179
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:05,880
Teach her well. Got it?

180
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,879
Yes, Father-in-law.

181
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,343
What?

182
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:11,624
What? I didn't say anything.

183
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,663
That's strange.

184
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:15,442
Come on, Dad.
I have to work, so please go.

185
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:16,846
Go on.

186
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,495
It's hard working
because of my dad, isn't it?

187
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:22,632
He's a cold guy.

188
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:23,923
Not at all.

189
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,396
Speak casually to me, please.

190
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:26,783
I'm much younger than you.

191
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:28,673
Oh, should I?

192
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:31,173
What is it that you do, by the way?

193
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:35,323
I'm actually a writer,
though I'm still aspiring to be one.

194
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:38,582
Wow, that's amazing.
What do you write?

195
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:40,445
Scripts.

196
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:41,453
Oh.

197
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:46,654
It's my dream to write a pure love story
like Shunji Iwai's "Love Letter."

198
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:48,562
I love that movie.

199
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,534
Once you finish writing something,
you have to show me first.

200
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:54,306
- Okay.
- You promised me.

201
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,774
<i>Okay, Wife.</i>

202
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:01,053
- What?
- Huh?

203
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:04,408
No, I didn't say anything.
I didn't say a thing.

204
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:13,410
How many times have we seen this?

205
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,950
Gosh, that "doo, doo, doo."

206
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,298
Just seeing a goldfish
makes me grind my teeth.

207
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:22,918
Hey, UFC is on right now.

208
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:25,730
- Should we turn it on?
- Should we?

209
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:40,244
All right, all right. Watch it.
Just watch it forever.

210
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:45,339
Doo, doo, doo...

211
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,264
What is this sound?

212
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:53,442
What is this sound?
Where's it coming from?

213
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:08,506
Hey, was that the sound of your heart?

214
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:13,663
Joon Ki, I think I'm in love.

215
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:14,750
Geez.

216
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,643
His sickness is back. It's back again.

217
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,676
- Who is it this time?
- Hm?

218
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:22,427
It's the convenience store
owner's daughter.

219
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:25,322
- She's so cute and pretty.
- Not interested!

220
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,467
Didn't I tell you before?

221
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,437
The cuter and prettier a girl is

222
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:32,419
the chance it works out with you
grows closer to zero.

223
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:34,177
So, dream on.

224
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:35,231
It's different this time.

225
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:38,133
She seems totally interested in me.

226
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:42,746
Hello? Yes.

227
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,448
A film production company?

228
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,140
Here you go.

229
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,715
I'm the owner and director of
Artist Tak Films, Tak Myung Hwan.

230
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:57,548
Ah, yes.

231
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:00,980
Your web novel made quite
the impression me, Writer Bong.

232
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,668
Oh, I see.

233
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:05,359
Was my web novel that good?

234
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:08,700
No, that web novel is trash.

235
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:10,561
Then, why...

236
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:14,561
However, in your web novel,
"President is Bruce Lee"

237
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:18,265
there is a bed scene
in book seven, page four.

238
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:21,668
I dare to say that you are
a genius in writing eroticism.

239
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:24,068
No, you're like a god.

240
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,749
I'll get to the point.

241
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,928
I would like to hire you for a script.

242
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:31,163
What? A script?

243
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:32,181
What kind?

244
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:35,166
Have you heard of the series,
"Goodbye, Sister-in-law"?

245
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,365
I've never heard of it.
What's it about?

246
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:41,375
It's an erotic film about forbidden love
between a brother and sister-in-law.

247
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,068
I need a script for
"Goodbye, Sister-In-Law 5"...

248
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:47,264
What do you take me for?
I don't write things like that.

249
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:50,837
Paul Verhoeven, Ang Lee, Stanley Kubrick.

250
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:53,721
- Do you know these three greats?
- Yes.

251
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:55,272
You must know their works

252
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:59,291
"Basic Instinct,"
"Lust Caution," and "Eyes Wide Shut."

253
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:04,272
I'm not trying to make
a mere erotic film with you.

254
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:09,035
Writer Bong, would you like to make
a great masterpiece with me?

255
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:12,471
Also, let's go to Cannes together.

256
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,282
What do you think?

257
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:35,893
Seo Jin, isn't it great being outside?

258
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:38,788
Doesn't it feel like the weight
on your heart is being lifted?

259
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:40,732
It's not great at all.

260
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:43,212
My heart just feels frozen.

261
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,884
Yoon Ah, I'm cold.
Let's go inside.

262
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:49,702
Wait, I brought you out because
I had something to say.

263
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,264
What is it?

264
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:54,673
Say it quickly. I'm really cold.

265
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,250
Seo Jin.

266
00:12:57,203 --> 00:13:01,764
"Falling is not failure.
Failure is the inability to get back up."

267
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,104
What?

268
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,573
Do you see that boy?

269
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:11,913
I don't know how many times
he's fallen to get that kite to fly.

270
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:14,914
Still, he hasn't given up
and he gets back up.

271
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:17,549
He succeeded in
flying that kite in the end.

272
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:18,582
And?

273
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:23,330
Just like that boy,
get back up again even if you fall.

274
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,451
Someday, you'll be able to fly high
in the sky like that kite.

275
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,857
Wow, look at that kite up in the sky.

276
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:36,769
Why would I bother looking at it?
I'm freezing to death.

277
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,303
Seo Jin, are you going to be this way?

278
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:40,863
Fine, I'll look at it.

279
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,796
Why are you telling me to look at it?

280
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:45,870
Oh no! Seo Jin!

281
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,821
Oh, what do we do? Are you okay?

282
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,389
Seo Jin, are you all right?

283
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:50,770
Blood, blood.

284
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,225
Blood!

285
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,495
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

286
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,136
Seo Jin, open the door.

287
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,504
Seo Jin!

288
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:04,750
<i>I said it's fine! Just leave me alone!</i>

289
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,059
Gosh, I told you to console her.

290
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,736
Why would you go look at kites
and create this situation?

291
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:11,865
I didn't think this would happen.

292
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:13,359
I'll try talking to her again.

293
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:16,328
Forget it. I'll take care of it.

294
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:21,034
What's so hard about consoling her?
How frustrating.

295
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:35,053
What is it?

296
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,437
What is it!

297
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,989
Dong Gu?

298
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:44,438
Why are you waking me up
when I'm sleeping?

299
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:45,951
We have somewhere to go together.

300
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,126
Where, at this hour?

301
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:50,639
You'll know once we get there.
Hurry up and get up.

302
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,865
I'm sleepy.
Where are we going now?

303
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:03,682
Why are we in the mountains
so early in the morning?

304
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:04,971
Well...

305
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,624
I had something I wanted
to tell you, Seo Jin.

306
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,243
Tell me?

307
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,299
What is it?

308
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:15,215
Seo Jin. "Falling is not failure."

309
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:18,147
"Failure is the inability
to get back up."

310
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:20,852
Seo Jin.

311
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:26,264
That sun always rises from the east
and sets in the west.

312
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:29,437
It doesn't stop there. It rotates again.

313
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:31,035
Then it rises again.

314
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,924
What about it?

315
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:37,399
So, if you don't stop here
and keep on going

316
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,174
you will shine bright one day
just like that sun.

317
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,585
You know what I'm trying to say, right?

318
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:49,812
Kiddo, should we go down then?

319
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:53,407
Seo Jin, want to make a bet
on who gets down first?

320
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:54,980
Hurry up.

321
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,610
Dong Gu, are you okay?

322
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,559
It hurts! Ow!

323
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,110
I hit it right on the rock,
the soft part of my bone.

324
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,370
Why did you insist on coming here?

325
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,325
Can you stand up?

326
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,652
Ow! I can't get up. I can't!

327
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:17,235
I hit the bone on the rock!

328
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,606
Ow, it hurts!

329
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,277
You said you have to get back up
even when you fall.

330
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,701
Sorry.

331
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:30,520
Still, don't forget what I said before.

332
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,889
- Falling is not failure.
- Shut up!

333
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,441
My gosh.

334
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:43,985
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.
Don't be mad.

335
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:45,712
I was wrong.

336
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:48,933
Gosh, after you said
all those thing to me.

337
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,125
It really did hurt.

338
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,783
The soft bone here
went right into the rock.

339
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,504
Be quiet!

340
00:16:56,504 --> 00:17:00,234
You two don't do anything right.

341
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:03,105
I'll make Seo Jin feel better
for certain.

342
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,373
You two stay out of it.

343
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,314
Don't you know how she feels?

344
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:09,303
How hard is it to console her?

345
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:12,989
You two are such amateurs.

346
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,583
What is it now?

347
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:29,346
What now?

348
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:33,739
Get up. We have somewhere to go.

349
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:35,259
Where now?

350
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,613
Seriously, why are
you all doing this to me?

351
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,555
You'll know once we get there.

352
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:41,296
Hurry and get up.

353
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:43,501
I really don't want to.

354
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,055
I'm not going.

355
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,460
Hurry.

356
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,458
I don't want to. I'm not going!

357
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:54,000
I said no! I'm not going.

358
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,162
Oh, what a shock.

359
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:06,885
Gosh, who is it?

360
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:09,267
<i>[Sun Woo: Doo Shik.]</i>

361
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:11,011
It's Sun Woo.

362
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:14,202
<i>Doo Shik, have you had lunch?</i>

363
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:17,003
Yes, I had instant black bean...

364
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:19,933
Spaghetti.

365
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,155
<i>Wow, that must've been so good.</i>

366
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:24,315
<i>I totally love spaghetti.</i>

367
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:30,256
Then should we go eat spaghetti sometime?

368
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:33,690
<i>Really? I would like that.</i>

369
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,906
Oh! She's so cute.

370
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:39,814
<i>Talk, talk. You have a message.</i>

371
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,480
Oh, it's Director Tak.

372
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:46,457
<i>Writer Bong,
I read the script you sent me.</i>

373
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:49,692
<i>But I'm just not feeling the bed scene.</i>

374
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,391
Oh, really?

375
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:57,549
I've captured a few good bed scenes.

376
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,907
I'll send them to you.

377
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:04,461
Take a look at them and tell me
which ones you like the feel of.

378
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:08,519
Hold on. Where did I put them?

379
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:13,700
Oh, here they are.

380
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:16,882
- Oh, this one.
- <i>Doo Shik.</i>

381
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:18,882
<i>Please recommend some movies for me.</i>

382
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:21,420
<i>The ones that you enjoy watching.</i>

383
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,073
Send.

384
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:28,182
Ones with this feeling?

385
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:33,635
All right. That's finished then.

386
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:36,087
Why isn't Sun Woo replying?

387
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:51,970
Oh, how? How did this
get sent to Sun Woo?

388
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,612
Damn it!

389
00:19:56,352 --> 00:19:58,338
She hasn't read it yet.

390
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,498
Don't read, don't read.

391
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,525
- Don't read.
- Doo Shik!

392
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,319
Sun Woo.

393
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,479
Hello, sir.

394
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,419
Where are you running off to
like a crazy man?

395
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,528
Is something wrong?

396
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:14,239
Not at all.
I'm just out for a jog.

397
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:17,690
Sun Woo, did you see my messages?

398
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,750
You sent me messages?
I didn't see them yet.

399
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,184
My dad suddenly wanted to go out to eat.

400
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:25,096
I forgot and left my phone.

401
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,061
Oh, is that right?

402
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,945
Why are you sending messages
to my daughter, huh?

403
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:34,025
It's only because I asked him to
recommend good movies to me.

404
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:36,967
Let's go eat, Dad.

405
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,883
- We'll get going.
- Okay.

406
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,583
Goodbye.

407
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:45,750
What a relief.

408
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,663
She hasn't seen them yet. Not yet.

409
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,388
Wait.

410
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:55,497
If they're going out to eat,
the house is empty.

411
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:01,102
This is the place.

412
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,354
You woke up a sleeping person
to go for a drive?

413
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:10,663
What? It's nice.

414
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:13,522
I do have something
to talk to you about too.

415
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,903
You too?

416
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:17,462
Why do so many people
want to talk to me lately?

417
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,423
What do you have to say?

418
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,875
Okay, Seo Jin.

419
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,141
"Falling is not failure."

420
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,150
"Failure is the inability
to get back up."

421
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,580
How did you know that?

422
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,010
Did you three plan this?

423
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,249
Why have you all been
saying this since yesterday?

424
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:37,189
Don't you get it yet?

425
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:39,034
Seo Jin.

426
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:41,897
Look at those reeds.

427
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:45,767
Just look at the field of reeds.

428
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:50,712
They sway when the wind blows,
but they will never fall.

429
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:51,778
So?

430
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:55,150
So, if you can beat out this wind

431
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,979
you can get back up like those reeds
and bloom into a beautiful flower.

432
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,499
Do you understand what I mean?

433
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:04,442
I do. I understand, so let's go home.

434
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:06,259
Good kid.

435
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,780
You feel stronger after
hearing my words, don't you?

436
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,403
I feel stronger, okay?
So, please go back home.

437
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:14,903
Kiddo. You're so cute.

438
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:17,037
All right. Let's go.

439
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:21,085
Okay, let's get going then.

440
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:22,808
We're going now.

441
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:25,901
What is this?

442
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:27,685
It's okay, it's okay.

443
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:30,165
How is it okay? It's stuck.

444
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:33,473
It will go. Here we go.

445
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:40,054
Good job, Lee Joon Ki.

446
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:45,315
What's going on here? What is this?

447
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:48,444
Hey... hey. What the heck.

448
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:51,066
Hey, hey. Seo Jin, wake up.

449
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,890
Take this thing off.
I can't drive because of it.

450
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,440
You're really going all out,
aren't you?

451
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:58,886
What's with this window?

452
00:22:58,886 --> 00:22:59,929
It's broken.

453
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,394
Hurry and get it off.
I'll end up in an accident!

454
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:03,666
This is crazy.

455
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,942
Where did you buy this car?

456
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:13,510
Good job.

457
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:16,750
- What's going on?
- What?

458
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,803
Joon Ki, do something about it!

459
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:20,307
Hold on.

460
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:23,300
Ow! It's going up even more.

461
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,731
It won't work. It just won't.

462
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,846
Then stop the car and fix it!

463
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:30,393
- How can I stop the car here?
- Then you expect me to stay like this?

464
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:33,108
Just wait. I'll find an intersection
to stop at. Hold on.

465
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:34,442
My arm hurts.

466
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:37,013
How could you do this to me?
How could you?

467
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:39,185
I was always like this.
Didn't you know?

468
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:42,247
People end up with
other women in life sometimes.

469
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:43,818
You're overreacting over nothing.

470
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:45,738
How can you say that?

471
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,428
You jerk!

472
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,326
All right. Hit me once.

473
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:51,507
Hit me once and let's have
a cool, beautiful goodbye.

474
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:53,878
Hit me. I'm ready. Come on.

475
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:56,730
Stop crying now.
Let's have a beautiful goodbye.

476
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,011
Hit me!

477
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,316
Gosh, stairs.

478
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:41,432
Why do they live up so high?

479
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:45,276
I'm on the 6th floor.
Apartment 605.

480
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,272
Apartment 605. Apartment 605.

481
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:49,131
605!

482
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:55,708
Sun Woo's room, Sun Woo's room!

483
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,786
Bathroom!

484
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:02,398
No, this isn't it.

485
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,692
Here it is!

486
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,162
There it is.

487
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,880
What is this? I'm going nuts.

488
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:29,825
How could you leave your wallet
at home when we're going out to eat?

489
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:31,834
I know. I'm sorry.

490
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:34,212
I said I'm sorry.

491
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:35,775
Sun Woo.

492
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:39,015
Doo Shik said he sent me messages.

493
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,173
What is this?

494
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:41,519
Let me see.

495
00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:45,443
<i>What is this? That little punk...</i>

496
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,173
He must be crazy!

497
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:48,827
<i>I ought to just...</i>

498
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:51,468
No, Dad. Doo Shik's not like that.

499
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,255
<i>He's a very innocent, pure person.</i>

500
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:56,103
Why do you keep taking his side?

501
00:25:56,103 --> 00:25:58,554
You don't like him, do you?

502
00:25:58,554 --> 00:26:01,076
No, I don't like him yet.

503
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,933
<i>What do you mean no? You do.</i>

504
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:05,838
<i>Don't you have anyone better around?
Why would you like him?</i>

505
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:07,792
Forget it. It's none of your business.

506
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:08,897
Give me my phone.

507
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:10,061
What are you going to do?

508
00:26:10,061 --> 00:26:13,836
I'm going to confirm with him
that it was sent by mistake. Why?

509
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:17,142
<i>Talk, talk. Pick up now.</i>

510
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:31,196
Sir.

511
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:33,721
This is all a misunderstanding.
It's a misunderstanding.

512
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:36,541
Sun Woo, it's not what it looks like.
It's a misunderstanding.

513
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,556
What happened was...

514
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,146
Why is this here?

515
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:46,141
You perverted creep!

516
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:47,488
No.

517
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,511
<i>Look here, Kang Seo Jin.</i>

518
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:52,705
Why did you slap someone
who was just standing there?

519
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:56,489
It's not that
she slapped him on the face.

520
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,000
Her arm was trapped in the window
and it was accidental.

521
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,301
Does that make sense?

522
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:03,002
Do you know how injured that man is?

523
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:05,888
It is true. This is insane.

524
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:10,045
Why did you have to slap him
and make him faint?

525
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,049
- Hey, hey!
- Are you okay, Seo Jin?

526
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,744
What's going on here?

527
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:15,662
What happened that
you're at a police station?

528
00:27:15,662 --> 00:27:18,230
Joon Ki, what did you do to her?

529
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,922
I was just driving
and a newspaper suddenly...

530
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:23,397
- What?
- So...

531
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:26,287
Her arm got stuck in the window
and suddenly...

532
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:28,535
I'm not a pervert.
It's all a misunderstanding.

533
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:29,604
Doo Shik!

534
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,262
- Why are you here?
- Dong Gu!

535
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:34,598
Let me go.

536
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:37,162
Dong Gu!

537
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:38,401
Dong Gu.

538
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:40,151
What? What is it?

539
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:42,636
Tell them I'm not a pervert.

540
00:27:42,636 --> 00:27:44,655
He isn't! He isn't. Who said that?

541
00:27:44,655 --> 00:27:49,182
- What a mess this is.
- Who said that?

542
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:53,069
Hey, why did you go
into their house anyway?

543
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:57,746
I don't know.
Don't ask me anything.

544
00:27:57,746 --> 00:28:00,710
It's a relief that you've only been
ordered to stay 100 meters away.

545
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,955
They'd put an
electronic monitoring device on you

546
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:04,454
if things didn't go your way.

547
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,261
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

548
00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:12,441
I didn't do it on purpose and
I was really just trying to console you--

549
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,289
Who asked you to do that?

550
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:16,679
I just asked you to leave me alone.

551
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,673
I already feel bad enough.
Why are you all doing this?

552
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:21,720
I didn't do anything.

553
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,999
Hey, hey. Seo Jin, Seo Jin.

554
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,366
I said I'm sorry.

555
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:28,295
What can I do to make you not angry?

556
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:30,846
I'll do anything you tell me to.

557
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:32,582
I'll die if you tell me to.

558
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:36,009
What is that? A strip show?
I'll even do that too.

559
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:38,782
Just say the word.
You can all do it too, right?

560
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:41,244
- I'll do it.
- Sure, I will.

561
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:43,421
- Then do it.
- Okay. What should I do?

562
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,951
- Strip show.
- What?

563
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:48,211
Now?

564
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,715
Here? In this weather?

565
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,746
What? You can't do it?

566
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:55,945
Then don't ever talk to me again.

567
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:57,122
Got it?

568
00:28:57,122 --> 00:28:59,172
Seo... Seo... Seo Jin.

569
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:02,515
Seo... Seo... Seo Jin.
Hey, Seo Jin!

570
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:09,914
Strip show.

571
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:16,440
Kang Seo Jin!

572
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,263
What?

573
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,480
- What's this?
- Hey, Dong Gu.

574
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:32,298
Joon Ki, what are you doing?

575
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:35,503
What? You said to do a strip show.

576
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,359
What are you two doing? Come on.

577
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,636
What are you doing? Just do it.

578
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:43,855
I just got let go by the cops.

579
00:29:43,855 --> 00:29:45,796
Do it, do it.

580
00:29:48,832 --> 00:29:52,249
So cold, so cold. Kang Seo Jin!

581
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,952
You didn't do anything wrong.

582
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:58,762
Hey, what's wrong with hitting a guy
who sexually harassed you?

583
00:29:58,762 --> 00:29:59,961
Isn't that right?

584
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:02,839
Yeah, guys like that deserve a beating.

585
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,627
Does it make sense to give up on
a dream because of a guy like that?

586
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:09,328
Soon, you'll get a job at a good place.

587
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:10,878
- Don't worry.
- That's right.

588
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:11,903
Oh yeah.

589
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:14,320
So stay strong, girl!

590
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,461
Yeah.

591
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:20,349
You've got this!

592
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,685
- You've got this!
- You've got this!

593
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:33,619
Crazy.

594
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,343
Stop it, already.

595
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,432
People are watching.
What are you doing?

596
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:40,795
- You laughed!
- You laughed.

597
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:44,134
- She's not mad anymore.
- She laughed.

598
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,959
All right. I'm not mad anymore.

599
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,165
So put on your clothes.

600
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:49,999
- Hurry up.
- Get dressed.

601
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,308
What are you doing there?

602
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,183
- Oh no!
- Run!

603
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:56,521
I'm not a pervert!

604
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:13,459
Seriously, why is he doing that?

605
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:16,287
Oh, that pervert.

606
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:18,712
Sun Woo!

607
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,900
I'm sorry!

608
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,920
I...

609
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,619
have been ordered to stay
100 meters away from you!

610
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:29,415
I can't be close to you!

611
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:31,676
What's he saying?

612
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:34,086
Sun Woo!

613
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:36,262
I'm sorry!

614
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:39,978
I guess I am a man, after all!

615
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:44,845
To tell you the truth,
I'm writing a script for an erotic film!

616
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:49,737
I really am sorry...

617
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:55,903
<i>Get moving quickly.</i>

618
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:58,837
The group is checking in soon.

619
00:31:58,837 --> 00:32:00,191
Okay.

620
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:03,734
Even if it's a group,
do we have to give up our rooms?

621
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:05,182
Where are we supposed to sleep?

622
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:07,491
Sleep wherever in the living room.

623
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,575
We haven't had a group booking
in a long time.

624
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:12,486
Yeah, let's think about
all the rent we owe and endure it.

625
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:14,413
The landlady called again earlier.

626
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:17,551
Really? Is she telling us
to move our business out again?

627
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:21,433
- Yes.
- That's a big problem.

628
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:24,611
We're so busy.
What's that guy been doing?

629
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,183
Can't you tell?

630
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:28,214
I'm regulating my condition.

631
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,972
- Mind control.
- Mind control, what a joke.

632
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:33,980
Leave him alone.
His first drama shoot is today.

633
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,960
He tries to copy everything
that the celebrities do.

634
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,577
Doesn't he, Yoon Ah?

635
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:41,679
- Yoon Ah?
- Huh?

636
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,233
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

637
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:44,993
Are you sick?

638
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,185
- I haven't felt well since this morning.
- Really?

639
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,410
Look at all this sweat.

640
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:57,675
What? You're boiling hot!

641
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:03,147
<i>This is the seasonal flu.</i>

642
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,064
What? The seasonal flu?

643
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:07,761
Yes, but you don't
need to worry that much.

644
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:10,670
Most people get better
after resting and taking medicine.

645
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,413
However, it's highly contagious,
so she should isolate herself.

646
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:16,490
It's very contagious? How contagious?

647
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,241
Extremely.

648
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:21,744
It can be easily transferred
through coughing.

649
00:33:21,744 --> 00:33:25,557
<i>[Complete Feeding]</i>

650
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,338
Sorry, I know there's
a group booking coming in too.

651
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:35,949
No, it's just a relief you'll
get better with rest and medicine.

652
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:37,538
What do we do though?

653
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:40,336
We can't have our guests infected.

654
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:41,529
That's true.

655
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:45,346
We have to quarantine her,
but our rooms are taken up by guests.

656
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:48,073
There are no rooms left.
What do we do?

657
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:50,410
Should we get a motel room, then?

658
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,169
What? Hey, man.

659
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,241
How can you send
a woman alone to a motel?

660
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,019
You are so cold.

661
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:59,596
If you're so worried about her,
take off that mask.

662
00:33:59,596 --> 00:34:02,578
I have my first shoot today.

663
00:34:02,578 --> 00:34:04,276
You understand, don't you?

664
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,407
Of course.

665
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:06,539
Thank you.

666
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,237
A motel is not right.

667
00:34:08,237 --> 00:34:11,264
Guests there could get infected too.

668
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:14,548
I suppose.
Then what should we do?

669
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:22,273
This really isn't right.

670
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,757
How can a sick person stay here?

671
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,398
Do you have another solution?

672
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:27,501
Should we cancel the group booking?

673
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,605
- Still, this is kind of--
- Hey.

674
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:31,621
No, I'll be all right.

675
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:35,851
There are the guests,
but I can't have Sol get sick.

676
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,309
There's an electric blanket.

677
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,838
There's a heater in there too,
so it won't be as cold.

678
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,237
Honestly, you hold some responsibility
for not taking care of yourself.

679
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:44,855
It may not be comfy, but endure it.

680
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:47,717
Hey, why would you say
such a nasty comment?

681
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:49,601
You cold punk.

682
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,262
Shut the door.

683
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:56,992
Wait. What about the bathroom?

684
00:34:56,992 --> 00:35:01,068
Ah, I didn't think of that.
The bathroom...

685
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:12,585
Hey, this really isn't right.

686
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:16,454
Yeah, you punk.
This is a violation of human rights.

687
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,867
How can you tell an adult to
go about their business here?

688
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,456
Do you think I want to do this?

689
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:23,376
Where did you even get this?

690
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:26,829
I borrowed it from
Mi Dal Restaurant down there.

691
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,416
Her daughter, Mi Dal, used this.

692
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,067
Music comes out if you press this,
so it's less embarrassing.

693
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,563
As if it's less embarrassing!

694
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:36,467
You are the cruelest person.

695
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,139
That's enough, everyone.

696
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,197
I'm okay. Please watch Sol for me.

697
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:44,320
Don't worry about Sol, Yoon Ah.

698
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,210
All right, the guests
will be here soon. Let's go.

699
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:03,304
It's almost time.
Why aren't they coming?

700
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:04,744
They'll be here soon.

701
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:06,606
Do you really think Yoon Ah will be okay?

702
00:36:06,606 --> 00:36:08,315
I worried with the weather being so cold.

703
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:10,226
Yeah, I know.

704
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:11,427
What did you say before?

705
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:13,494
She should endure it
since she's responsible

706
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:14,748
for not taking care of herself?

707
00:36:14,748 --> 00:36:15,965
What did I do wrong?

708
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,146
- It's true that she didn't.
- Why, you...

709
00:36:19,146 --> 00:36:21,650
Oh, here they come. They're here!

710
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,405
Over here!

711
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:25,436
Seo Jin, go on
and take them to their rooms.

712
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:26,976
Okay.

713
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:30,742
Aloha!

714
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,992
Hey. Good afternoon.

715
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:44,126
Wow, how long has it been
since we've had a group booking?

716
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:48,333
So, Dong Gu, you know
what I mentioned about...

717
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,954
- Hey.
- Huh?

718
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:51,737
You have a runny nose.

719
00:36:51,737 --> 00:36:53,239
Runny nose?

720
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,166
Oh, why do I have a runny nose?

721
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,958
Get over here.

722
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:02,318
What is this? You have a fever too.

723
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:04,204
You don't have...

724
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:08,639
No way. I doubt it. It can't be.

725
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:11,998
- I said I don't.
- Get away from me!

726
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:13,572
Germs!

727
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:16,407
My goodness. Geez.

728
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:20,867
Dong Gu.

729
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:23,005
Why do you have that blanket?

730
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:26,635
He has the flu too.

731
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:31,097
Get in. Hurry up and get in.

732
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:34,570
I will go in. Stop poking me.

733
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:39,271
What's taking you so long to get in?

734
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:49,018
Did you get it from me,
by any chance?

735
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:51,809
Who else would I get it from then?

736
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,905
I was supposed to shoot
a baby's 100th day tomorrow.

737
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,711
This is crazy.

738
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,876
I will turn left.

739
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:11,916
I will turn right.

740
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:15,114
Right turn... right turn.

741
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,309
Why is my throat so tight?

742
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:23,523
I'm not sick too, am I?

743
00:38:23,523 --> 00:38:26,954
This is my first day.
I have to do well and not make mistakes.

744
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,811
Gosh. Who did this?

745
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:33,601
My neck, my eyes!

746
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,940
Seriously!

747
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:40,338
Who did this?

748
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:45,710
Oh! My eyes and neck.

749
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:50,788
My Rebecca! No, my Rebecca!

750
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:53,242
Where are you looking when you drive?

751
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,576
Sorry, I'm a beginner driver.

752
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:57,501
Don't bring your car out
if you can't drive, then.

753
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,335
How unlucky of me.

754
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:01,630
I'm in a rush so give me
your contact information.

755
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,358
Yes, yes.

756
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:04,661
Hurry it up!

757
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:07,295
- Hurry and give me your business card!
- Yes, I'm sorry.

758
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:10,597
Gosh, the roads are scary.
You're a murderer in waiting.

759
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:13,128
What are you thinking?

760
00:39:13,128 --> 00:39:14,505
Ouch, my eye.

761
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:18,811
Don't you cry, Rebecca. My Rebecca.

762
00:39:18,811 --> 00:39:21,708
Oh, I'm in pain.

763
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,447
Hello, Director.

764
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,309
Oh, you're here?

765
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:33,490
Your eye...
and what's wrong with your neck?

766
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,375
I got in a little car accident
on my way here.

767
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:39,175
But it won't affect the shoot in any way.

768
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:40,780
Okay, that's a relief.

769
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,009
Did you practice a lot?

770
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:45,632
Of course, there is no need to worry.

771
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:48,987
This is why I like you, Joon Ki.

772
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,422
Director, Writer Kwon is here.

773
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,239
Writer Kwon?

774
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,076
- Joon Ki.
- Yes?

775
00:39:56,076 --> 00:39:57,503
You haven't met Writer Kwon, right?

776
00:39:57,503 --> 00:40:00,181
- No.
- Come. I'll introduce you.

777
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:02,521
- Introduce me?
- Yeah.

778
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:04,536
You are the driver.

779
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:05,746
Yes.

780
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:09,744
Writer Kwon!

781
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:11,023
Oh, you scared me.

782
00:40:11,023 --> 00:40:13,885
You must be busy writing.
Why did you bother coming?

783
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:20,873
Oh, where did he go?

784
00:40:20,873 --> 00:40:23,858
- Who?
- Let's just go.

785
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:25,952
Let's take a 10 minute break!

786
00:40:31,204 --> 00:40:33,746
That driver is...

787
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:47,190
Dong Gu, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

788
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:50,659
It's fine.

789
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:54,059
Yoon Ah.

790
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,099
Can I give you a piece of advice?

791
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,240
What is it?

792
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,853
Do you know that you're sort of
a nuisance type of character?

793
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:07,166
You don't do it on purpose.

794
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:11,105
You cause harm to others
and end up indebted to people.

795
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:13,346
It's really not a good thing.

796
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,632
It starts to become a habit.

797
00:41:16,632 --> 00:41:21,739
I'm saying this out of concern for you,
so don't be offended by it.

798
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:24,646
Okay, I'll be careful from now on.

799
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:29,088
I hate to cause others harm
and be indebted more than anything.

800
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,389
I really don't understand it.

801
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,697
For goodness' sake.

802
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:36,119
I don't know how you can bear it.

803
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,284
Over here.

804
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:49,653
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

805
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:51,646
It's cold, isn't it?

806
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:53,510
- Sit, sit.
- Yes.

807
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,655
- I'm pushing the chair in.
- Thank you.

808
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:57,010
Here you go.

809
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:02,086
How are you feeling?

810
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,885
Oh, I'm feeling just fine.

811
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:08,637
I think I feel healthier
now that I've been in the accident.

812
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:10,650
My appetite is back.

813
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:13,596
That's a relief.

814
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:16,056
But why did you want to meet?

815
00:42:16,056 --> 00:42:17,853
Ah, yes.

816
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:22,215
Honestly, I wondered if
I was too rude this morning.

817
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:25,324
I thought, perhaps, I hurt your feelings.

818
00:42:25,324 --> 00:42:28,822
You don't know how much I worried.

819
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:30,398
Not at all.

820
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:35,302
Actually, I wasn't in
my right mind this morning.

821
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:38,557
I don't know if I should say this
to someone I just met.

822
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:41,480
It's my childhood friend...

823
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,327
He passed away this morning.

824
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:48,155
His name was Kang Dong Gu.

825
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:51,250
He was like a brother to me.

826
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,320
Oh, I see.

827
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:58,123
Now that I think about it,
he came to this restaurant regularly.

828
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:00,809
Dong Gu.

829
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:09,492
There. You can eat this one.

830
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:11,170
You really don't have to do that.

831
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,219
Just eat that one.
It's because I'm sorry.

832
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:16,052
It's fine.

833
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:19,621
Hold on. It's a little chilly, isn't it?

834
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:21,340
Excuse me, waitress.

835
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,641
Could you bring us a lap blanket?

836
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:25,719
- Yes.
- Thank you.

837
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,538
Please eat.

838
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:37,804
I don't know if the food
was to your liking.

839
00:43:37,804 --> 00:43:39,952
It was so delicious.

840
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:41,925
What a relief.

841
00:43:41,925 --> 00:43:46,786
Then will you forget about
my mistake this morning?

842
00:43:46,786 --> 00:43:48,038
Of course.

843
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,943
Then, please get home safely.

844
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:54,208
I'll get going now. Bye.

845
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,740
- Wait.
- What is it?

846
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,983
By any chance,
do you have a girlfriend?

847
00:43:59,983 --> 00:44:03,094
What? A girlfriend?

848
00:44:03,094 --> 00:44:06,259
I don't. Why do you ask?

849
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:09,885
What? So, you're dating that writer?

850
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:11,682
What was I supposed to do?

851
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,253
If I'd rejected her,
it'd be worse than when I yelled at her.

852
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:19,717
I'll just have to date her
while I do the drama.

853
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:23,681
You make your life so difficult.
You really do.

854
00:44:25,773 --> 00:44:28,628
Wait. What time is it?

855
00:44:33,936 --> 00:44:35,942
<i>Food's here! Eat your food!</i>

856
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,556
- Hey.
- I'm busy. I have to go.

857
00:44:42,255 --> 00:44:44,715
That guy is just feeding us like animals.

858
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,126
You're just leaving the food?
This isn't a prison.

859
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,181
I'll go get it.

860
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:54,197
Forget it. I'll go get it.

861
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,606
So cold.

862
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:04,032
Let's see what it is.

863
00:45:08,965 --> 00:45:10,096
Dong Gu!

864
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:12,483
- My back, my back.
<i>- Are you okay?</i>

865
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:15,371
- Dong Gu!
- My back.

866
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:17,248
Are you okay?

867
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:20,286
I'm okay... I'm oka--

868
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:24,347
Oh, that hurts.

869
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,036
I can't move.

870
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:35,217
Aren't you eating, Dong Gu?

871
00:45:35,217 --> 00:45:38,858
I'm going to eat. My gosh.

872
00:45:40,481 --> 00:45:43,764
Oh, my back. Seriously.

873
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:47,193
Yoon Ah, can you help me up?

874
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,525
Why?

875
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:52,331
I thought you couldn't
bear to be indebted to others.

876
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:56,110
You said that'd be a nuisance
and it gets to be a habit.

877
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,914
Never mind, then.

878
00:45:57,914 --> 00:45:59,994
I was only asking to see.

879
00:45:59,994 --> 00:46:02,322
I'll lie down and eat.

880
00:46:02,322 --> 00:46:04,715
No need to say that
with big, round eyes.

881
00:46:04,715 --> 00:46:07,976
Why isn't this working?

882
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:10,577
Should I feed you?

883
00:46:10,577 --> 00:46:13,793
- No thanks.
- Forget it if you don't want me to.

884
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:26,583
If you insist on feeding me,
then you can do so.

885
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:29,333
Gosh.

886
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:40,835
Yoon Ah, like I told you earlier

887
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:44,175
I'm not the type of person
to be indebted to others.

888
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:47,847
Okay? So, don't get the wrong idea.

889
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,800
Water, water, water!

890
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,423
Here.

891
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:57,802
I nearly died.

892
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:03,835
I really don't rely on others like this.

893
00:47:03,835 --> 00:47:07,653
All right. I got it, so just eat.

894
00:47:08,295 --> 00:47:10,956
- "Ah."
- Yoon Ah!

895
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:15,242
One ham wrapped in dried seaweed.

896
00:47:15,242 --> 00:47:17,358
Rice comes after.

897
00:47:29,215 --> 00:47:31,163
<i>Oh, I have to pee.</i>

898
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:33,313
<i>Did I drink too much water?</i>

899
00:47:33,313 --> 00:47:36,112
<i>Ah, I'm going crazy here.</i>

900
00:47:57,963 --> 00:47:59,532
Oh my.

901
00:47:59,532 --> 00:48:02,322
Dong Gu, are you all right?

902
00:48:02,322 --> 00:48:04,902
Where are you trying to go right now?

903
00:48:04,902 --> 00:48:07,166
I wanted to get some air.

904
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,701
You're not even feeling well.
Why would you go outside?

905
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:11,967
Lie down again.

906
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:18,208
I have to pee.

907
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:19,954
What did you say?

908
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,920
I said I have to pee.

909
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,679
- What?
- I said I have to pee...

910
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,545
We're here, so stop.

911
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:32,514
Right here.

912
00:48:32,514 --> 00:48:35,469
Go down right where you're standing.

913
00:48:38,744 --> 00:48:40,521
There you go.

914
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:45,394
Dong Gu, can you undo your zipper?

915
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:48,092
Of course, I can undo my zipper.

916
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,369
What do you take me for?

917
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:53,496
I told you I don't like
to be indebted to others.

918
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,458
You may go now.

919
00:49:06,554 --> 00:49:10,530
She's going to hear everything.
This is driving me nuts.

920
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,222
Seriously, now.

921
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:37,621
Yes.

922
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:40,625
Yes, Hye Jin.

923
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:44,893
Yes, see you tonight.

924
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:48,286
Yes, yes.

925
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:50,483
Oh, that's hot.

926
00:49:50,483 --> 00:49:52,958
It's not like you're kids
dating for the first time.

927
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,518
Why are you talking all night?

928
00:49:54,518 --> 00:49:57,871
Writer Kwon refuses to hang up.
What could I do?

929
00:49:57,871 --> 00:50:01,632
Do you know what she said
as she hung up?

930
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,932
She said she'd tell me the details
when we met up.

931
00:50:03,932 --> 00:50:06,291
What kind of a writer
doesn't write the script?

932
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:08,853
What? Then you have
another date tonight?

933
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:10,538
Yes.

934
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:14,563
Why is living so hard? Why must I live--

935
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,844
It's the director.

936
00:50:17,844 --> 00:50:19,893
Hello, Director. This is Lee Joon Ki.

937
00:50:21,007 --> 00:50:22,264
Yes.

938
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:24,777
Now?

939
00:50:29,882 --> 00:50:32,346
Why are you drinking so much
in the morning?

940
00:50:32,346 --> 00:50:34,697
Did something happen?

941
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:39,003
I fought with my girlfriend
a while back, and...

942
00:50:39,947 --> 00:50:42,766
she asked for a break
to think about things.

943
00:50:42,766 --> 00:50:44,666
I think she met another guy in that time.

944
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,199
What?

945
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:48,992
That really is so harsh of her.

946
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:52,081
You had a girlfriend, Director?

947
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:54,672
- This is a secret.
- Okay.

948
00:50:54,672 --> 00:50:57,427
- Keep it to yourself.
- Of course.

949
00:50:57,427 --> 00:50:59,052
Writer Kwon.

950
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,356
That Writer Kwon?

951
00:51:06,356 --> 00:51:08,552
The Writer Kwon who is writing our drama?

952
00:51:08,552 --> 00:51:10,849
Anyway, wait and see.

953
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:15,976
Whoever he is,
I won't let him get away with it.

954
00:51:16,518 --> 00:51:17,599
How?

955
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:21,967
I'll do whatever I need to
in order to find him.

956
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:25,219
I will... destroy him.

957
00:51:28,097 --> 00:51:29,648
What?

958
00:51:29,648 --> 00:51:32,315
The director and the writer were dating?

959
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:33,862
Yes.

960
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:37,094
What am I supposed to do now?

961
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,617
How could things
get so twisted like this?

962
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:43,038
Why does he live like that?

963
00:51:43,038 --> 00:51:44,742
Gosh.

964
00:51:44,742 --> 00:51:46,791
<i>[Writer Kwon]</i>

965
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:49,097
I told you from the beginning--

966
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,001
Hye Jin.

967
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:58,644
Yes. Of course.

968
00:51:58,644 --> 00:52:03,030
I'm heading out now. Yes.

969
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:08,596
I have to go on a date with Writer Kwon.

970
00:52:11,012 --> 00:52:13,382
What is he planning to do?

971
00:52:13,382 --> 00:52:15,371
I really don't know.

972
00:52:15,943 --> 00:52:18,771
By the way, I wonder how Dong Gu
and Yoon Ah are doing.

973
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:21,175
I wonder if Dong Gu
is picking on Yoon Ah again.

974
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:22,826
I hope not.

975
00:52:24,134 --> 00:52:26,282
Blow hard, blow.

976
00:52:26,282 --> 00:52:30,213
Harder than that. Harder.

977
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:33,891
Oh my. So, so dirty.

978
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:35,510
Yoon Ah.

979
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,601
I'll tell you one more time.

980
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,496
- I usually don't like to be--
- Don't say it!

981
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:40,760
Okay.

982
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:50,114
Why is there so much dirt on your face?

983
00:52:50,114 --> 00:52:54,402
Now that I don't have Sol here,
I have a big baby.

984
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:04,764
We're here.

985
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,554
This is where I live.

986
00:53:06,554 --> 00:53:08,195
Ah, I see.

987
00:53:08,195 --> 00:53:11,942
It's late today. Go in and rest.

988
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:15,393
I don't want to say goodbye.

989
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,800
Do you want to come in for some coffee?

990
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,934
Coffee?

991
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:22,545
Oh no! What do you mean? It's fine.

992
00:53:22,545 --> 00:53:24,536
You must be tired. Go on and rest.

993
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:27,380
I'm fine. Let's go in.

994
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,577
- Where?
- Come on.

995
00:53:28,577 --> 00:53:30,507
Wait, wait.

996
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:42,528
Hello, there.

997
00:53:42,528 --> 00:53:44,885
- This is my place.
- Yes.

998
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,331
I'm okay to walk.

999
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,634
Hey.

1000
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:56,923
Then I'll just have one coffee
and get going.

1001
00:53:56,923 --> 00:53:58,902
All right.

1002
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,416
Then sit here and wait
while I make coffee.

1003
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:03,067
Okay.

1004
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,443
Who is it?

1005
00:54:22,355 --> 00:54:24,028
Why is he here?

1006
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:26,396
<i>Hye Jin, open up.</i>

1007
00:54:27,173 --> 00:54:29,505
<i>Hye Jin, open the door.
Let's talk.</i>

1008
00:54:29,505 --> 00:54:31,894
Joon Ki, there's something
I haven't told you yet.

1009
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,947
There was a guy I was dating.

1010
00:54:33,947 --> 00:54:36,538
I'll explain everything
and end it cleanly.

1011
00:54:36,538 --> 00:54:38,467
- Don't misunderstand, okay.
- No!

1012
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:41,525
Don't do that. Don't do anything.

1013
00:54:41,525 --> 00:54:44,161
<i>Hye Jin, are you really
going to be this way?</i>

1014
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:45,942
I know you're inside!

1015
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,278
I already know!

1016
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:52,277
<i>I saw you going in with that punk!</i>

1017
00:54:52,277 --> 00:54:54,139
Don't worry. I won't let you get hurt.

1018
00:54:54,139 --> 00:54:57,748
I will get hurt.
Don't do anything. I'm begging you.

1019
00:54:57,748 --> 00:55:01,931
If you're going to be like this,
I'm just coming in, okay?

1020
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,972
Don't open it. Don't open the door.

1021
00:55:12,565 --> 00:55:16,139
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1022
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:17,942
Oh, you reek of alcohol.

1023
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:19,559
You drank again?

1024
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,175
Yeah, I did. So, what?

1025
00:55:21,175 --> 00:55:23,788
Where is he, anyway?

1026
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:25,438
Where is he?

1027
00:55:25,438 --> 00:55:26,798
What's wrong with you?

1028
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:29,918
What's it to you who I date or not?

1029
00:55:29,918 --> 00:55:32,168
<i>Where did you hide him?</i>

1030
00:55:32,168 --> 00:55:34,481
<i>Let's see that great face of his.</i>

1031
00:55:35,688 --> 00:55:37,784
<i>Oh, he must be in here.</i>

1032
00:55:37,784 --> 00:55:39,753
Damn it.

1033
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,927
Get out here, you punk.

1034
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:45,621
<i>I'll break this door down
if you don't come out!</i>

1035
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:50,594
Huh? Where did he go?

1036
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:53,179
Get out. Get out here, you punk.

1037
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:56,423
Look at you. Oh, look at you.

1038
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:58,998
- Stop right there!
- Director!

1039
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:09,126
Oh, I finally caught you.

1040
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:11,027
You dare to steal my girl?

1041
00:56:11,027 --> 00:56:13,327
Let me see what you look like.

1042
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:14,340
- No.
- Hey.

1043
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,934
Get rid of this. Get rid of it now!

1044
00:56:18,934 --> 00:56:20,619
Gosh!

1045
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:24,634
Move this thing!

1046
00:56:26,788 --> 00:56:29,668
Huh? You...

1047
00:56:30,331 --> 00:56:32,023
You punk.

1048
00:56:33,853 --> 00:56:35,659
Hello, Director.

1049
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,405
It's me, Lee Joon Ki.

1050
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:41,583
What? So, you're dating Writer Kwon?

1051
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:42,650
It's a misunderstanding.

1052
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,054
I got into a car accident
with Writer Kwon.

1053
00:56:45,054 --> 00:56:47,898
She suddenly asked to date me,
so I was forced to date her.

1054
00:56:47,898 --> 00:56:51,568
So, Writer Kwon is not so great.

1055
00:56:51,568 --> 00:56:53,952
She really isn't my type.

1056
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,235
Joon Ki!

1057
00:56:57,588 --> 00:57:01,059
Writer Kwon, I didn't mean that.
Please listen.

1058
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:03,876
Director, it's not that.
What happened was...

1059
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:06,208
Director, it was just that...
Oh, I mean, Director...

1060
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,472
Writer Kwon. I mean, Writer Kwon.

1061
00:57:07,472 --> 00:57:10,996
I... I'm the director, you punk.
I'm the director.

1062
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:12,422
I'm Lee Joon Ki.

1063
00:57:12,422 --> 00:57:14,090
You punk rascal!

1064
00:57:17,307 --> 00:57:21,021
Hey, man. Why do you live like this?

1065
00:57:21,998 --> 00:57:25,170
Do you think I knew this would happen?

1066
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:28,711
You don't think I'll get fired
or anything, right?

1067
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,038
No way.

1068
00:57:30,038 --> 00:57:34,003
That writer is a pro too.
It would be petty to get revenge.

1069
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:37,248
I should be okay, right?
I really should be.

1070
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:39,322
It's okay, it's okay.

1071
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:43,849
It's okay, it's okay.

1072
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:49,940
Dong Gu, are you okay?

1073
00:57:51,873 --> 00:57:54,820
Oh, your fever is getting worse.

1074
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,561
I'm fine.

1075
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:59,657
I'm sure I'll be fine once I sleep.

1076
00:58:16,112 --> 00:58:18,971
What are you doing instead of sleeping?

1077
00:58:18,971 --> 00:58:21,378
I had some books to read.

1078
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:29,106
Do you still want to be a patisseur
or whatever it is?

1079
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:32,945
Yes, it is my dream.

1080
00:58:32,945 --> 00:58:36,568
Also, I won't give up, for Sol's sake.

1081
00:58:36,568 --> 00:58:39,351
You sure are stubborn.

1082
00:58:40,786 --> 00:58:43,847
Yoon Ah, I'm sorry,
but can you get me my phone?

1083
00:58:46,547 --> 00:58:48,422
Hello?

1084
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:50,648
What?

1085
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:53,867
I don't need it.
I'm already overflowing with loans.

1086
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:57,567
Yoon Ah, hang it up.
Don't these people sleep?

1087
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:03,289
Who is this person, Dong Gu?

1088
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,750
Ah... my mom.

1089
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,565
Wow, she's beautiful.

1090
00:59:09,565 --> 00:59:13,735
I don't think I've ever heard you
speak about your mother.

1091
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,440
She passed away.

1092
00:59:19,414 --> 00:59:22,065
Oh, I see.

1093
00:59:25,644 --> 00:59:28,894
What kind of person was your mother?

1094
00:59:28,894 --> 00:59:30,670
My mom?

1095
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:36,175
Well, she was stubborn and prickly,
and she nagged me all the time.

1096
00:59:36,175 --> 00:59:42,056
Like you, she never gave up on
something once she decided to do it.

1097
00:59:42,056 --> 00:59:46,385
I was hit by her a lot
when I was growing up.

1098
00:59:46,385 --> 00:59:48,315
She must have been a strong person.

1099
00:59:48,315 --> 00:59:50,719
Still, she had a soft heart.

1100
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,626
She would nurse me all night
and give me medicine.

1101
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:01,090
Don't you miss her?

1102
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:04,148
Of course, I do.

1103
01:00:04,648 --> 01:00:09,554
I miss her so much,
but I can't see her.

1104
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:16,018
Your cough is getting worse.

1105
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:17,965
You'd better get to sleep, Dong Gu.

1106
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:20,335
I think I should.

1107
01:00:43,675 --> 01:00:45,822
What's this?

1108
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,572
How did this...

1109
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,494
Then did Yoon Ah do this?

1110
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,068
Oh, I must've fallen asleep.

1111
01:01:18,173 --> 01:01:21,228
Did Dong Gu's fever go down?

1112
01:01:25,016 --> 01:01:27,239
It did.

1113
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:29,340
What a relief.

1114
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:39,742
Dong Gu, are you sleeping?

1115
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:47,030
Dong Gu.

1116
01:01:56,032 --> 01:01:58,487
Oh, I feel like I can live now.

1117
01:01:58,487 --> 01:02:00,983
I thought I was going to die.

1118
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,300
What do I do?

1119
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,077
It smells.

1120
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,231
You missed Mommy,
didn't you, Sol?

1121
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:21,702
Mommy missed you too, Sol.
I missed you so much.

1122
01:02:21,702 --> 01:02:25,315
You all suffered
taking care of Sol. I'm sorry.

1123
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:28,375
It's okay. Don't worry.

1124
01:02:29,126 --> 01:02:31,762
It's starting.
Joon Ki's drama is starting.

1125
01:02:32,472 --> 01:02:35,655
Don't watch. I told you not to watch.

1126
01:02:35,655 --> 01:02:37,838
Why? It's your drama debut.
We have to watch.

1127
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,298
- Where's the remote control?
- It's on.

1128
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:42,588
<i>We've arrived, Chairman.</i>

1129
01:02:42,588 --> 01:02:43,702
It's on.

1130
01:02:43,702 --> 01:02:45,842
<i>I won't let them get away with it.</i>

1131
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:47,603
<i>They dare try to take my place?</i>

1132
01:02:47,603 --> 01:02:50,672
<i>I'll destroy everything here today.</i>

1133
01:02:50,672 --> 01:02:52,713
<i>- Driver Kim.
- Yes, Chairman.</i>

1134
01:02:52,713 --> 01:02:53,905
<i>Would you like this candy?</i>

1135
01:02:53,905 --> 01:02:55,907
- That's sudden
- <i>Yes, Chairman.</i>

1136
01:02:55,907 --> 01:02:57,324
Don't eat it.

1137
01:03:06,144 --> 01:03:10,233
What? Why is he doing that
after eating the candy?

1138
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:13,898
<i>Driver Kim! Driver Kim!</i>

1139
01:03:13,898 --> 01:03:15,873
<i>Who knew he'd die
such a meaningless death?</i>

1140
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:17,847
<i>I'm sorry, Driver Kim.</i>

1141
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:20,751
<i>Still, the dead are dead,
so let's forget.</i>

1142
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:22,277
<i>Find a new driver, Secretary Han.</i>

1143
01:03:22,277 --> 01:03:23,956
- <i>Yes, Chairman.</i>
- What was that?

1144
01:03:23,956 --> 01:03:26,347
That's the end?
He eats candy and dies?

1145
01:03:26,347 --> 01:03:27,496
You're not on anymore?

1146
01:03:27,496 --> 01:03:29,277
No.

1147
01:03:29,277 --> 01:03:31,318
That writer really holds a grudge.

1148
01:03:31,318 --> 01:03:34,101
How could you kill someone off like that?

1149
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,739
Where were you?
You missed the drama.

1150
01:03:40,739 --> 01:03:44,280
I saw it on my phone.
He dies eating the candy.

1151
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,572
Joon Ki, what kind of candy was it?
Was it peppermint?

1152
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:51,838
Is that important right now?

1153
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:54,827
Yes, it was peppermint. It was!
Are you satisfied?

1154
01:03:54,827 --> 01:03:56,710
Really?

1155
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:00,670
It's the peppermint candy's fault.
Why are you getting mad at me?

1156
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:06,711
Yoon Ah, take this.

1157
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:07,784
What is it?

1158
01:04:07,784 --> 01:04:10,170
You said you wanted
to become a patisseur.

1159
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:14,865
You could read home-baking books
for 100 days but that wouldn't help.

1160
01:04:14,865 --> 01:04:16,356
You need a license from an academy.

1161
01:04:16,356 --> 01:04:18,581
I don't have money to go to one.

1162
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:20,175
You don't have to pay.

1163
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:23,405
There's a government program
that supports single moms.

1164
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:24,965
- Really?
- Yes.

1165
01:04:24,965 --> 01:04:28,778
I looked in the area and there are
some good baking academies.

1166
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:33,378
We should go tomorrow and apply
for the money and look into a school.

1167
01:04:33,378 --> 01:04:35,686
Thank you, Dong Gu.

1168
01:04:35,686 --> 01:04:37,873
There you go again.

1169
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:40,911
Don't cry over every little thing!

1170
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:44,467
Thank you, Dong Gu.

1171
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,351
What's this?
Why is your face red, Dong Gu?

1172
01:04:50,909 --> 01:04:52,172
What?

1173
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:54,762
What do you mean?

1174
01:04:54,762 --> 01:04:57,500
It's because I can't breathe.

1175
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:02,097
Why... why are you suddenly hugging me?
You're a strange lady.

1176
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:04,641
Oh, he's even stuttering.

1177
01:05:04,641 --> 01:05:05,831
What's going on?

1178
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:07,942
You two lived together
on the roof for a few days.

1179
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:09,271
Did you catch feelings or what?

1180
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:12,014
What are you talking about?
It's not like that!

1181
01:05:16,818 --> 01:05:18,307
My goodness.

1182
01:05:18,307 --> 01:05:19,985
Strange.

1183
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:22,726
Put on something else.
Why watch this when he died?

1184
01:05:25,913 --> 01:05:28,614
My gosh. What feelings?

1185
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,864
Why did your face turn red then?

1186
01:05:31,864 --> 01:05:33,628
Do I really...

1187
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:37,300
No, that makes no sense.

1188
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,746
It can't be.
