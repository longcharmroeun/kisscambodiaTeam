3
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,397
What was that?

4
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,281
Ew, I need water.

5
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,620
Oh, water.

6
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:33,923
What was that?

7
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:55,632
Hello.

8
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:59,274
Yes, that's me.

9
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:02,387
Pardon me?

10
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,792
Oh... yes.

11
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,843
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:10,641
If you could give us a little more time,
we'll pay that within the week.

13
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:12,568
What?

14
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,818
Then how are we supposed to
run our business?

15
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:19,038
Hello? Hello?

16
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,688
Why are you noisy?
What is it?

17
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:28,826
They're shutting off our water.

18
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:30,389
Our water bills haven't been paid.

19
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:32,112
What?

20
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:34,877
When?

21
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:36,257
Right now.

22
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,212
Hey, you think this is funny?

23
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,562
Is this funny?

24
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:47,456
I told you I don't like jokes like this.

25
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,574
Hey, are you really
going to be like this?

26
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,324
Hey, Kang Dong Gu.

27
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:56,183
Turn on the water now
unless you want to get into trouble.

28
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,860
- Joon Ki, Joon Ki.
- Huh?

29
00:02:57,884 --> 00:02:59,763
This way, this way.

30
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,521
Oh. Kang Dong Gu.
Stop joking around and turn it on.

31
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:05,173
What joke are you talking about?

32
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:07,454
The water's shut off because
we haven't paid our bills.

33
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,872
What? The water's shut off?

34
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:11,906
Ow! Ow!

35
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:14,275
Gosh! Ouch!

36
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:15,567
Come on, now.

37
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,818
I told you to pay the utilities on time.

38
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:20,049
Don't you think I wanted to?

39
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,878
I had no money,
so what could I do?

40
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:23,382
How much could that be anyway?

41
00:03:23,382 --> 00:03:25,451
- 420,000 won.
- 420,000 won?

42
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,280
- Yes.
- That is a lot.

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,632
Still, how could you not even
have 400,000 won?

44
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,491
This is all your fault, Joon Ki.

45
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,911
The guest house is a "blue ocean"?

46
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,850
If we just open it,
the Chinese tourists will pour in?

47
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,195
We can earn a ton of money
and film a movie?

48
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,784
How was I supposed to know that
this THAAD issue would arise?

49
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:46,066
How could I predict
the relations of the eastern--

50
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,253
Shut up!

51
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:49,153
Do you know how many loans we have?

52
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:51,617
We're on the verge of being ruined.

53
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:54,530
Now, we don't even have water,
so how can we do business?

54
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,459
Hey, don't worry about it.

55
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,830
Don't you think three guys
can't come up with 400,000 won?

56
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,127
Yeah, things can't
get worse than they are now.

57
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:04,990
- Let's be optimistic, Dong Gu.
- What?

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,986
Be optimistic?

59
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,587
Oh, you're right. I was wrong.

60
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:12,657
I almost made a big mistake.

61
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:14,977
We have no guests in sight.

62
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:18,067
Our loans are growing with interest
and we have no water now.

63
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,028
I was just too darn pessimistic.

64
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:22,949
I deserve to die for my wrongdoing.
Should I get on my knees?

65
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,536
That's not what I meant, Dong Gu.

66
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:25,947
Then what!

67
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:29,468
Hey, why are you getting mad at him?

68
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,209
It's all right. It's all right.

69
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,353
Yeah, I'm the crazy punk.

70
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:36,791
I'm the crazy one for trusting you two
and starting a business.

71
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,744
I am crazy. I really am.

72
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,944
What? Optimistic?

73
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:44,783
Why, you...

74
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:47,954
Nothing ever works out.

75
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,641
That guy has rage issues
if you think about it.

76
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,860
It's all right. Calm down.
Are you crying?

77
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,250
Why are you crying?
We should be optimistic.

78
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:06,855
What?

79
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:10,148
Things can't get worse than this,
so be optimistic?

80
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:12,906
If things get worse than this,
then it will be hell.

81
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:16,334
What is that?

82
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:20,363
What's that sound?

83
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:47,526
Why is there a baby...

84
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:51,607
Joon Ki! Doo Shik!

85
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,596
What is it? What?

86
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,257
- What, what?
- What is it?

87
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,521
- What?
- Why?

88
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,310
- Go, go.
- What is it about?

89
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,766
- Just go. Hurry.
- What is it?

90
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:06,728
It's a baby doll.

91
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:08,699
- It's moving.
- Huh?

92
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,369
It moved.

93
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,920
It moved.

94
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,377
It looked me in the eye.

95
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:27,903
It moved. It moved.

96
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,420
<i>[New World]</i>

97
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:50,632
Why in the world is it here?

98
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:52,427
Why, why, why?

99
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:53,637
Could be a guest's baby?

100
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:55,617
We haven't had a guest in ages.

101
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:57,858
That's why we were drinking
all day yesterday.

102
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,637
Someone could've come
while we were drunk.

103
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:00,862
You think so?

104
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:03,083
I blacked out so
I don't remember anything.

105
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,408
Joon Ki, you don't know?
You didn't drink.

106
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,668
You know I slept because
I'm going to a shoot today.

107
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:09,788
Why don't we look
through the bag for now?

108
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:11,548
There could be contact information.

109
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:12,747
Should we do that?

110
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:24,221
There's nothing here.

111
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:26,303
Then what's going on?

112
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,903
Since the bag is here,
maybe the guest just left for a moment.

113
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:30,564
Does that make sense to you?

114
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:34,216
What kind of parent leaves
a tiny baby like this alone?

115
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:37,442
Hey, the baby's crying. It's crying.

116
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:39,456
Do something about it. Do something.

117
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:40,824
- What?
- Just do something.

118
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:42,305
Well...

119
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:45,204
Baby, are you hungry?

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,971
Or did you pee or poo?

121
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,307
- What is this?
- What? Is something there?

122
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:57,487
Hold on.

123
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,019
Oh my...

124
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:03,266
- What is that?
- The baby pooped.

125
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:26,141
Okay, then...

126
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:29,533
I'm going to open it up.

127
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:39,889
What? What is it?

128
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,629
Is it all over the place?

129
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,360
No, it's just that...

130
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:50,462
there's nothing there on the baby.

131
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:52,648
- She's a girl.
- What about it?

132
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:55,649
Even if she's a baby...

133
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,529
is it okay for me to change
a girl's diaper like this?

134
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,847
Our Dong Gu has such great manners.
He's a gentlemen.

135
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:03,871
What do you mean?

136
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:08,299
Don't be ridiculous and
just change the diaper, you punk!

137
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,960
I'll change it, okay?

138
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,273
Sorry, okay?

139
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,971
Wet wipes, Wet wipes!

140
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,686
Hurry it up! Hurry!

141
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,845
- Give me a wet wipe too.
- Okay.

142
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:26,528
More wipes, more.

143
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:28,158
- More, more, more!
- Okay.

144
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:30,859
Oh! Give me the diaper.

145
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:33,250
- Diaper, diaper!
- Diaper!

146
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay, okay. I'm done.

147
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,909
Good job.

148
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,500
Well, now.

149
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:47,693
It was no big deal.

150
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,115
Wet wipe.

151
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:58,345
Wet wipes!

152
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:00,280
Hey, kid.

153
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:04,493
I fed you formula
and changed your diaper.

154
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:07,673
So, why do you keep crying?

155
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,861
Should we just report it to the police?

156
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:11,927
What if the guest just
stepped out for a bit?

157
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,726
Yeah, let's just wait for a day.

158
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,548
The kid will be tired
at a police station.

159
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,716
So noisy.

160
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,284
No guests and no water.

161
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,974
Now, there's a baby too.

162
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:23,957
I'm just dying here.

163
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,403
Gosh, my back hurts.

164
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:28,461
Oh, my back.

165
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:35,299
Oh, what's this?
She stopped crying, right?

166
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,809
Hey, that's amazing.

167
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,826
Woo!

168
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,256
Wow, I think I can live now.

169
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:44,688
- What?
- Gosh.

170
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,062
Why are you crying again?

171
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,062
What were you just doing? Do it again.

172
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:51,058
Get up, get up. Hurry.

173
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:55,092
I just stood up and bent my back.

174
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,841
Hey, you stand there just like that.

175
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,871
Just like this?

176
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,607
Then what can we do?
Otherwise, she'll cry.

177
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,707
But how can I keep doing this?

178
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,366
Then let's switch places.
I'm so tired.

179
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,567
Oh my. Look at the time.

180
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,707
I have to go film that movie,
so I have to go.

181
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:13,620
You said it was later tonight.

182
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,653
Hey, I'm filming with the great
Park Sung Woong today.

183
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:19,173
I should go practice my scenes
with him, right?

184
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:20,493
Thanks, then. Bye.

185
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:23,893
Wait. How early are you going?

186
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,163
Doo Shik.

187
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:30,075
I have to go to my part-time job.
Thanks, Dong Gu.

188
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:33,456
- What job?
- The convenience store. Bye.

189
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:35,168
- Hey, hey.
- Work hard.

190
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:37,379
How can you just leave?
Bong Doo Shik!

191
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:42,188
I'm going crazy here. I'm going crazy.

192
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,448
Hello? What's up, Su Ah?

193
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,173
Talk about something important?

194
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,668
Now?

195
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:56,179
Okay. Let's go.

196
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:57,673
All right.

197
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,933
Looks good. Okay.

198
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:02,408
Look up.

199
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,443
Last one.

200
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,351
Good work, Su Ah.

201
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:09,596
Thank you.

202
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,327
<i>[Yoohan Bank: As of February 5th]</i>

203
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,248
<i>[you have outstanding loans
of 12,316,340 won.]</i>

204
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:30,217
Su Ah, I'm here.

205
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,453
Oh, you're here?

206
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:34,399
What's this?

207
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,748
So, I woke up this morning
and she was in my room.

208
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:40,441
A guest must have...
I don't know. I don't know.

209
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:41,941
- It's a long story.
- Stay strong.

210
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,222
Thanks.

211
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:46,149
Su Ah, you're what keeps me alive.

212
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,654
What did you want to talk about?

213
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:50,068
Oh, let's break up.

214
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:53,104
What?

215
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:56,917
Break... break up?
What do you mean?

216
00:12:56,917 --> 00:13:00,263
Hm... how should I put it?
Let's just break up.

217
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:03,321
Why? What's the reason?

218
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:05,571
Three days and nights isn't enough
time to tell you why.

219
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:06,621
Let's just break up.

220
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:08,051
So, just tell me.

221
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:10,269
I'll listen for three days and nights,
or even a year.

222
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:12,508
Really? Okay, then.

223
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,462
First, you're too immature.

224
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,336
Second, you don't have enough talent.

225
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,063
Third, I don't see a future with you.

226
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,532
4th... 5th... 6th...

227
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,462
7th... 87th...

228
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:24,955
89th, your hairstyle really sucks.

229
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:27,899
90th, the sounds you make while
eating are really annoying.

230
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,010
- 91st...
- Stop, that's enough!

231
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:32,480
I got it, so stop.

232
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:35,129
Gosh, wow.

233
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,287
How could you stand it
if you hated me so much?

234
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:39,543
- Did you even love me?
- Love?

235
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,942
I did.

236
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:43,801
But you can't only
look at love forever.

237
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,227
You seem really materialistic.

238
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:48,860
It's not that I'm materialistic.
You're just immature.

239
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,400
Anyway, it's been fun.

240
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:53,181
I'll return this to you.

241
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:56,254
Fine. Let's break up.

242
00:13:56,254 --> 00:14:00,059
I don't need that ring,
so do what you want with it.

243
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,865
Thanks so much for
dating a loser like me.

244
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:05,331
Please eat well and live well.

245
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:21,222
Let's shoot that scene one more time.

246
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,389
Okay!

247
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,759
- Do a good job today.
- Hey.

248
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,115
Joon Ki, you're here.

249
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:30,201
Hey, I had to beg the director
for this favor, so do a good job.

250
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:31,710
All right.

251
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,530
I get paid for the role as soon as
I finish filming, right?

252
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,711
Yes, I said you would.

253
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:39,716
You haven't met
Park Sung Woong yet, have you?

254
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,436
- No.
- Let's go. I'll introduce you.

255
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:42,581
Okay.

256
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,855
Senior, this is Lee Joon Ki,
the person you will be acting with today.

257
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,091
<i>[Heartless Man]</i>

258
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:58,456
Hello, Senior.

259
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:02,985
It's a true honor to act with my hero.

260
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:07,910
Pardon?

261
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:15,609
Excuse me?

262
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:20,725
What?

263
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:26,573
Sen... Senior!

264
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:27,754
What?

265
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:30,599
Why... Why is being like that?
Did I do something wrong?

266
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,149
Why are you so dense?

267
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,448
He complimented the glint in your eyes,
but you said nothing.

268
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,364
- When?
- He did this to you.

269
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:40,804
That's what that meant?

270
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,844
He could say it in words.
Why did he do that?

271
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:44,764
He never speaks much.

272
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:48,243
He really hates it when people don't
understand his words, so be careful.

273
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:49,840
- Got it?
- Yes.

274
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,942
See you later.

275
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:55,625
He doesn't speak,
but hates it if you don't understand.

276
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,926
Then what am I supposed to do?

277
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,147
Ah... is that what charisma is?

278
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:06,197
That was charisma... charisma.

279
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,260
Ready!

280
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,216
Action!

281
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,572
Cut! What is it, Senior?

282
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,226
Me... me?

283
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,250
What?

284
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:44,903
Huh... I...

285
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,582
Senior, where are you going?

286
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:53,663
Senior!

287
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,794
Director Jo, who brought that kid?

288
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:00,812
I'm sorry, Director.

289
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:02,721
Gosh.

290
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,705
Hey, get it together.

291
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:09,757
What did I do?

292
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:13,095
Senior Sung Woong told you to
take a step back, so why didn't you?

293
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:14,477
He told me step back?

294
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:16,808
- When?
- He kept doing this.

295
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:19,465
He did this and told you three times.

296
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:21,256
You said that meant
he likes the glint in my eyes.

297
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:23,135
That depends on the situation.

298
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,924
How could you be so dense?

299
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:27,694
Senior Sung Woong!

300
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,945
Why can't he just say it in words?

301
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:35,375
This is driving me crazy.

302
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:41,365
Gosh.

303
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:44,128
Why can't they pay me in advance?

304
00:17:45,324 --> 00:17:47,846
What am I supposed to tell Dong Gu?

305
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:49,037
I'm going crazy.

306
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,630
How can this be...

307
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,365
I'm going crazy.
How am I supposed to know?

308
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:59,509
Joon Ki. Joon Ki!

309
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,530
You're just getting back?

310
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,480
Yeah, you getting off from
the convenience store?

311
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,722
Yes, do you want one too?
It's only three days past expiry.

312
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:07,967
Forget it.

313
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,663
You can eat up
and live until you get old.

314
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:13,156
Why are you in such a bad mood?

315
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,337
Did something happen?

316
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,531
Oh yeah. You were
filming with Park Sung Woong.

317
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,342
How is he? Full of charisma?

318
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:23,051
He does have charisma.

319
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,288
- He's a little strange though.
- How?

320
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,957
He doesn't talk.

321
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:31,311
But he hates it
if you don't understand him.

322
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:34,491
He doesn't talk but hates it
if you don't understand him?

323
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:36,501
- Does that make sense?
- That's what I'm saying.

324
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,309
Look, suppose I'm Park Sung Woong
and you're me.

325
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,012
We were filming and he does this.

326
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,755
Like this... what does it mean?

327
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,675
- To go one step back.
- How did you know?

328
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:48,074
It seems obvious to me.

329
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:51,474
All right, fine.

330
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,634
We met for the first time.

331
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,826
I told him it was an honor to meet him.

332
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,248
Then he went like this.

333
00:18:58,038 --> 00:18:59,625
What does that mean?

334
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,688
- He likes the glint in your eyes.
- Everyone knows?

335
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:02,878
Only I don't know?

336
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:05,746
You ought to know depending on
the situation. You're so dense.

337
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,808
- What?
- How will you be an actor?

338
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:09,069
How is this...

339
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:12,316
This darn finger.

340
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:17,166
We're home.

341
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,433
What about the baby's mom?

342
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,682
Are you sick?

343
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,862
Then what's with you?
Is something wrong?

344
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:33,615
Is not talking a trend or what?
Just talk, you punk!

345
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:35,160
Su Ah and I broke up.

346
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:38,178
Huh? Why? For what reason?

347
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,807
Reason? I stopped listening
after about the 90th one.

348
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,471
She would've stayed up
all night if I'd let her.

349
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:44,135
Why? What's wrong with you?

350
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:46,204
Hey, it's so obvious.

351
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:49,645
Su Ah is getting older too and
her family is probably talking marriage.

352
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:51,353
Just look at him.

353
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:55,311
Does he have a good job,
money, or a bright future?

354
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,450
On top of that,
this guest house will fall into ruin.

355
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,923
I would break up with him too.

356
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,059
Dating is a luxury
for poor people like us.

357
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:11,161
Were you depressed like this
because a girl dumped you?

358
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:13,872
You didn't latch on to her
like a loser, did you?

359
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:15,451
Why would I do that?

360
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,257
I said I don't need you either.

361
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,596
Then I took my couple ring off
and threw it on the floor.

362
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:21,914
Why you throw that away?

363
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:24,016
That's gold and
gold is expensive these days.

364
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,202
Yeah, we could pay
our water bill with that.

365
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:28,352
You are so thoughtless!

366
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,352
- Should we look for it?
- Are you crazy?

367
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:32,865
Why would you look for it?
A man has his pride.

368
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,432
So, you stay here and guard your pride.

369
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,294
- We'll go get it. Let's go!
- Be quiet!

370
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:37,630
Did you get any money?

371
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,179
I have tuna kimbap.

372
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,680
You can have it all to yourself.

373
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,371
I never expected anything
from you two anyway.

374
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:49,119
Hey, I'll get paid tomorrow
once I finish shooting.

375
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:51,323
What do we do with her?

376
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:52,971
We can't wait forever.

377
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:55,739
I don't know anymore.
Let's call the police. I'm so tired.

378
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:57,900
Let's wait a little longer, Dong Gu.

379
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,645
Yeah, just wait until tomorrow.
I feel bad for her.

380
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:03,174
If you feel so bad for her,
then you two watch her.

381
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:05,765
I've been bouncing all day,
my back hurts so much.

382
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,772
Take turns. Undo this now.

383
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:09,451
- Move up there a bit.
- Okay.

384
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:10,747
Go, go.

385
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:13,230
I said undo this.

386
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:16,647
Where are you going? Get over here!

387
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:18,541
Get over here!

388
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,580
Open the door.

389
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,601
You locked it?

390
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,071
I'm going to break it down.
I can really break it.

391
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:25,821
I'm angry. I'm getting the hammer.

392
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,403
I'm going to get it.

393
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,729
Get over here!

394
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:33,210
Hey, open it! Hey!

395
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:34,928
Gosh.

396
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:40,535
Get over here. Get over here.

397
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:48,508
I'm going get sick
because of this little thing.

398
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,267
These jerks.
They're gone already?

399
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:54,346
They've become really diligent.
It's not like them at all.

400
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,597
My goodness.

401
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:59,815
Hello. Yes, speaking.

402
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:02,059
What? The electricity?

403
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,605
This week?

404
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:07,407
Our water's off and if you turn the
electricity off, how can we run our--

405
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:09,325
Hello? Hello, hello?

406
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,221
They hung up. You hung up again?

407
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:14,368
What am I supposed to do?

408
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:17,025
Save me, would you?

409
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:25,189
Come on. What's with you?

410
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:26,258
How embarrassing.

411
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:34,775
A man has to have his pride.

412
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,188
Oh, Dong Gu.
What brings you by?

413
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:48,438
Su Ah's not here yet.

414
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:50,836
Oh, then can I wait inside?

415
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,796
- Sure, you can do that.
- Thank you.

416
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:54,290
Oh, by the way...

417
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,419
did the studio get cleaned yesterday?

418
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:57,949
No, it didn't. Why?

419
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:58,987
It's nothing.

420
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:22,670
What are you doing here?

421
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:25,819
Oh, you're here?

422
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,376
Oh, that... I'm just, uh...

423
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,298
You acted like
you'd never see me again.

424
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:32,525
What brings you by?

425
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:34,362
Oh, the thing is...

426
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:37,528
I had something to ask you.

427
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:39,959
- What is it?
- It was, uh...

428
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,653
When do you think the THAAD
issue will be resolved?

429
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,477
You came to ask me about that?

430
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:50,800
Yes.

431
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,829
We may be broken up,
but we are both Korean people.

432
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:56,001
We can still discuss
foreign affair issues.

433
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,494
Don't you think so? Right?

434
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:06,155
We can meet and discuss these things.

435
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:14,933
Wait.

436
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,434
Yes, what? What?

437
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:20,834
Shouldn't resolving the problem
to the north be priority?

438
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:25,173
I'm thinking a two track solution with
six-party talks being held by the UN.

439
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:30,189
Great. That's a good solution.

440
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:32,836
Do you really think that
would be best though?

441
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:38,893
Then what do you think?

442
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:41,299
How would I know?
The politicians should know. Bye.

443
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:43,209
What was that?

444
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:48,438
Kang Dong Gu is always so forgetful.

445
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:52,342
Dong Gu! Kang Dong Gu.

446
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:58,076
<i>[Gold Store]</i>

447
00:24:58,951 --> 00:25:00,051
Hello.

448
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,143
Hello. You buy gold rings, right?

449
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:03,943
Yes, I do.

450
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:05,551
What do you want to sell?

451
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,084
This here.

452
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:12,625
Not all of this. This thing here.

453
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:17,517
How much can I get?
It's 18 karat gold.

454
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,836
Is that what you came looking for?

455
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:25,929
Su Ah.

456
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:31,355
You should've told me.
I would've looked with you.

457
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:32,849
Well, the thing is...

458
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:36,349
our water bill payments are overdue
and even our electricity, too.

459
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,356
Really? Then...

460
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,046
add this to it too.

461
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:42,634
Ah...

462
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:45,669
You left your phone.

463
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:50,249
Su Ah. Su Ah! Su Ah...

464
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:11,326
Senior Sung Woong,
you're so funny.

465
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:13,326
How could something like that happen?

466
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:19,751
That is so shocking.

467
00:26:22,713 --> 00:26:24,064
Hello, Senior.

468
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:32,478
I'm so sorry that I couldn't
understand you yesterday.

469
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:33,714
Please forgive me.

470
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:48,420
Thank you for forgiving me.

471
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:00,380
Hey, you understood this time.

472
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,061
You're finally getting used to it.

473
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:04,651
Really? I really got it right?

474
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:08,544
Yes, he went like this and
he tapped your shoulder too.

475
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,994
Make sure not to offend him anymore
and do a good job.

476
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:14,566
All right.

477
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,784
So, it is working out.

478
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,214
Oh my. I'm so sorry.

479
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,042
Cut. Okay!

480
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:38,663
Good job, everyone!

481
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,336
Senior, great working with you.

482
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:49,654
Thank you for the compliment, Senior.

483
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:50,977
I'll work hard.

484
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,443
What? Really?

485
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:05,092
Yes, Senior.

486
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:10,798
Everyone! Senior Sung Woong will
treat everyone to Hanwoo beef today!

487
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:21,057
Park Sung Woong, Park Sung Woong,
Park Sung Woong, Park Sung Woong!

488
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:34,713
Senior, why don't you say a few words?

489
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,219
Thank you for the food!

490
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:45,733
Cheers!

491
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:02,896
My stomach is dancing
after feeding it good beef.

492
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:07,930
Senior, I enjoyed the food.

493
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:15,256
What is it?

494
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:18,977
Pardon?

495
00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:22,678
What?

496
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,307
What is it?

497
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:17,076
<i>I'm home.</i>

498
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,824
Did something happen?
What's with the mood here?

499
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,203
Joon Ki may not be able work in
the film industry anymore.

500
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,205
Why?

501
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,726
Park Sung Woong told him
to take a rice off his face.

502
00:30:32,726 --> 00:30:34,353
He gave him a kiss on the cheek.

503
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,490
Why did he do that?

504
00:30:37,051 --> 00:30:38,971
I saw the look in his eyes.

505
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,792
It was easy to make the mistake.

506
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:44,172
I thought he wanted the kiss
for the beef he bought.

507
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,490
What's with you, then?

508
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,700
He went to look for the couple ring
and got caught selling it by Su Ah.

509
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,872
What?

510
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:55,266
She was looking at me just like that.

511
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:57,497
With eyes full of scorn.

512
00:30:57,497 --> 00:30:59,039
Gosh.

513
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,414
Still, we can pay the water bill now.

514
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:02,957
I didn't sell it.

515
00:31:02,957 --> 00:31:06,317
I may be at my lowest,
but I couldn't sell the couple ring.

516
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:07,492
Then what do we do?

517
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,496
How can we take guests with no water?

518
00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:10,826
I know.

519
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:17,612
We really are a sad lot.

520
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:22,063
How could three guys not come up
with a mere 400,000 won?

521
00:31:29,372 --> 00:31:32,394
Why don't we stop now...

522
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:34,663
and give up?

523
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,446
Give up? On what?

524
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:40,255
Let's close the guest house.

525
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:42,997
What do you mean?
We said we'd make money to make a film.

526
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:44,155
We're supposed to go to Cannes.

527
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:47,038
Dream on, man.
How can we make a film?

528
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,910
We'd be lucky not to starve to death.

529
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,048
Yeah, I don't think this is right.

530
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:57,384
Both this guest house and the film,
let's just give up.

531
00:31:57,384 --> 00:32:00,507
We're just giving up in our life.

532
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,368
What kind of life is this?

533
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:04,989
What do we do with her though?

534
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,351
What else? We should
take her to the police.

535
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,355
Even her parents gave up,
so what can we do?

536
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:13,098
Still, it is the last time.
Shouldn't we feed her one last time?

537
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,788
The formula ran out.

538
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,188
Was this what she used to eat?

539
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:34,615
Why is this so expensive?

540
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:36,174
Do you have money?
Take your cash out.

541
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:38,484
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

542
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,199
That's ours.

543
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,588
We only put it down for a moment.

544
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:45,028
There's no such thing.
It belongs to whoever gets it first.

545
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:47,135
Hey now. I said it's ours.

546
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:48,871
What are you doing? Let go.

547
00:32:48,871 --> 00:32:50,579
- Oh.
- Hey.

548
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:53,020
What is this? What's going on?

549
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,396
These people are insisting that
this formula is theirs.

550
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:58,646
We were going to buy it
and put it down for a second.

551
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,760
Oh, why are you arguing over nothing?

552
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,710
Why don't you young men
just give up on it?

553
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,847
What?

554
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:09,834
Give up?

555
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:11,714
Why?

556
00:33:11,714 --> 00:33:13,439
Why should we give up?

557
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,815
Well, that's because--

558
00:33:14,815 --> 00:33:16,994
We worked hard too,
so what can we do if things didn't work?

559
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,465
We worked ourselves to death.

560
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:20,578
The world isn't helping us,
so what can we do?

561
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:24,688
The painting, wallpaper, and interior
were all done by us through hard work.

562
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:26,890
It was our last hope.

563
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,587
What are you talking about right now?

564
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:32,595
We can give up on everything,
but I can't give on this formula!

565
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,586
All right? Give it!

566
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:36,818
Me too!

567
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,030
Me too!

568
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:19,150
Did you see that
woman's expression back there?

569
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:21,887
It was white and pale.

570
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:22,983
I know.

571
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:25,855
Who did she think she was messing with?

572
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:30,983
It's the perfect weather
to drink formula milk.

573
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:33,893
It's nice and warm.

574
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:37,753
What are you two doing?

575
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,255
Filming a movie?

576
00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:41,554
What? It's fun.

577
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:43,914
This punk always ruins the mood.

578
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:45,202
I know.

579
00:34:45,914 --> 00:34:49,264
Hey, you saw how we protected
your food, right?

580
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:51,126
You can't forget that.

581
00:34:51,126 --> 00:34:54,914
Yeah, you'll get in trouble by me
if you do, okay?

582
00:34:54,914 --> 00:34:56,280
Yeah, kid.

583
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,634
Oh, look at that.

584
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:01,563
- Oh my god.
- So cute.

585
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,914
Yeah, yeah. Cute baby.

586
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:05,590
Thank you. Thank you.

587
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,501
You're on a tour?

588
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:10,418
Yeah, we're traveling together.

589
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:11,793
Where are you going now?

590
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:15,059
Actually, we're just kind of
looking for a place to sleep.

591
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,347
- Sleep? Sleep, sleep?
- Are they sleepy?

592
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:19,701
We have a guest house.

593
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,809
Oh, really?

594
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:23,690
Do you happen to have empty rooms?

595
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,927
Yeah. Room, room, room.

596
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:28,385
We have many rooms... many rooms.

597
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:31,346
- So, you want rooms?
- Yeah, sure.

598
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:32,534
Tonight?

599
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,275
Tonight. Let's go!

600
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:37,653
Let's go! We have guests.

601
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:40,088
Okay, okay. Follow me.

602
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,193
They're here!

603
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:44,903
They're here!

604
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:47,978
Guests?

605
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:49,389
Guests.

606
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:53,527
- Guests!
- Guests.

607
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:04,277
What's going on here?
This isn't a dream, right?

608
00:36:04,277 --> 00:36:07,702
Yeah, I don't think we've had this many
guests since our opening.

609
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:10,007
I think the baby is a blessing.

610
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:14,215
We paid off the water
and electricity bill with this.

611
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:17,853
We can pay off the loans and
make a film if this keeps up.

612
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:20,670
Are you happy?
I thought you wanted to give up.

613
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,192
Well, that was...

614
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,929
I'm saying I want to
give up on giving up.

615
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:27,360
Just move.

616
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,726
That guy.

617
00:36:37,615 --> 00:36:39,516
Is that right?

618
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:41,827
Do you feel good, princess?

619
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:45,327
You like your big brother that much?

620
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:46,916
Must you talk like that?

621
00:36:47,577 --> 00:36:51,057
Oh, Dong Gu.
Is it bothering you that much?

622
00:36:51,057 --> 00:36:52,576
Aw, aw.

623
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:54,748
- Give it a rest.
- You brat.

624
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,530
Is our Dong Gu mad?

625
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,601
Oh, how scary. So scary.

626
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,210
That devil.

627
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:04,914
I told you to stop. Stop!

628
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:10,411
Why are you screaming? She's crying.

629
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:14,474
Wait. Maybe she's hungry.

630
00:37:14,474 --> 00:37:16,934
- Where's the formula?
- I put it in the kitchen.

631
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:19,550
Princess, just wait a little bit.

632
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,398
I'll get your food ready.

633
00:37:21,398 --> 00:37:22,780
Oh dear.

634
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:25,288
- Come here.
- Hey, hey.

635
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:37,019
Do you think her parents
really threw her away?

636
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:39,487
How could they do that to that cute baby?

637
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:41,893
I'm sure they had their reasons.

638
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,657
What if no one ever comes?

639
00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:45,445
Then we can just raise her.

640
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:47,027
Didn't you see how guests came
because of her?

641
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:49,074
I'm a little scared that
her mom will show up.

642
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:51,717
Still, how can we raise her?

643
00:37:51,717 --> 00:37:53,719
I don't know.
Let's think about that later.

644
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:56,634
It's time for our blessing to eat.

645
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,322
Our little princess,
it's time to eat yummy food.

646
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:02,324
Where is she?

647
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:06,139
Hey, hey! Our blessing, our blessing!

648
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:16,132
Hey, stop! Hey, hey!

649
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:20,324
Hey! Someone get that person!

650
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:21,659
Hey!

651
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:45,389
Hey! Stop right there!

652
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:47,927
Hey! Get over here!

653
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:50,692
Get over here! Stop!

654
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:55,896
Go that way.

655
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,525
I'm fine. Get him.

656
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,925
Get up. Get up.

657
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,105
Sorry about that. I'm sorry.

658
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:28,617
Gosh, you sure run well.

659
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:30,427
You're dead today.

660
00:39:30,427 --> 00:39:31,815
Let me see you. Hey!

661
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,438
Oh...

662
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:37,768
Are you hurt at all?

663
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:39,847
My name is Lee Joon Ki.

664
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:44,275
And your name is?

665
00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:49,998
<i>[Birth of a Family]</i>

666
00:39:51,452 --> 00:39:52,650
Sol, I'm sorry.

667
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:55,510
Your mom is so sorry.

668
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:59,181
Mom is so sorry.
I won't ever do it again.

669
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:00,710
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,579
Sol, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

671
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:05,547
Her name is Sol?

672
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,646
Gosh, you shouldn't have left her
if you were going to cry so much.

673
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:13,195
That was a harsh thing to say.

674
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:14,353
Must've been hard.

675
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,329
Do you need a shoulder?

676
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,320
Do you want to do that in this situation?

677
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,652
What did I do?

678
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,000
Stop it.

679
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,690
Why did you leave your baby here?

680
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,909
Yes, why?

681
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:28,838
Where is the baby's father?

682
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:29,846
Yes, her father.

683
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:34,199
- Then where's your home?
- Yes, your home.

684
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:37,626
Stop crying and say something.

685
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:40,168
Then we can take you home or something.

686
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:43,246
There must be a reason she can't say.
Stop pushing.

687
00:40:46,726 --> 00:40:49,306
I'm sorry, and I'll get going now.

688
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:51,554
Now? Do you have a place to go?

689
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:54,927
You don't even have a place to go.
Where will you go with the baby?

690
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:57,315
Even if you leave,
you should stay the night.

691
00:40:57,315 --> 00:40:59,157
Stay the night? What do you mean?

692
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,186
There are no rooms.

693
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:01,621
There's Seo Jin's room.

694
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,769
She'll probably spend the night
at the library.

695
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:06,090
No, I don't want to burden you.

696
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,768
You're not a burden.
It's okay to stay the night.

697
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:11,661
Also, don't pay any attention to him.

698
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:15,059
He got dumped by his girlfriend,
so he's just bitter and twisted.

699
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,170
Who got dumped?
It was a mutual break up.

700
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,311
I have no feelings for Su Ah anymore.

701
00:41:21,418 --> 00:41:23,371
Why are you bringing that up now?

702
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:28,019
If it's not true, then fine.
Why is he getting mad?

703
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,164
- Hey!
- Stop it.

704
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,777
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

705
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:34,396
Let's go. It's all right.

706
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:36,750
Slowly and carefully.

707
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,023
Sleepy, sleepy, sleepy.

708
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:36,492
I need to sleep.

709
00:42:37,478 --> 00:42:38,559
Sleep.

710
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:41,311
Sleep.

711
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,844
What is this? Who are you?

712
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:57,478
Are you a burglar?

713
00:42:57,478 --> 00:42:59,119
No, it's not like that...

714
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,929
Oh my goodness. What is that?

715
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:03,684
What's going on here!

716
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:05,434
- What the heck!
- What!

717
00:43:05,434 --> 00:43:06,664
Why did you scream?

718
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:09,106
Burglar, baby, burglar...

719
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:11,612
Burglar, baby...

720
00:43:12,402 --> 00:43:14,434
Gosh, I thought it was something.

721
00:43:14,434 --> 00:43:16,713
This girl always makes a scene.

722
00:43:17,452 --> 00:43:19,923
Yoon Ah, are you okay?
You must be shocked.

723
00:43:19,923 --> 00:43:22,092
What? You know her?

724
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:25,161
Yes, this is Yoon Ah.
She came here.

725
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:27,097
Chewbacca, you look good.

726
00:43:27,097 --> 00:43:29,744
You're a woman now.

727
00:43:29,744 --> 00:43:30,759
What?

728
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:35,090
Get out. Get out now!

729
00:43:39,065 --> 00:43:42,681
I see. Then why didn't you call me?

730
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:46,250
We're not the kind of siblings to
call each other about such things.

731
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:49,579
- I suppose.
- Sorry, this is my fault.

732
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:52,192
No, I'm sorry for my mistake.

733
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:55,952
Anyway, it's late,
so sleep for one night with Yoon Ah.

734
00:43:55,952 --> 00:43:58,277
- Together?
- Then should I sleep with her?

735
00:43:58,277 --> 00:44:00,938
Dong Gu. Don't you know
I can't sleep with others?

736
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,824
I said no but
these two insisted she stay.

737
00:44:03,824 --> 00:44:05,057
There are other rooms.

738
00:44:05,057 --> 00:44:07,137
There are no empty rooms
because we have guests.

739
00:44:07,137 --> 00:44:09,998
- How did you fill all the rooms?
- It's a long story.

740
00:44:09,998 --> 00:44:12,007
That's how it is
so just endure it for one night.

741
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:15,302
How can I sleep in the same bed
with a person I just met?

742
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:17,130
You're making such a fuss.

743
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,764
Then sleep on the floor.

744
00:44:18,764 --> 00:44:21,797
You woke us all up from our sleep.
You clean this up.

745
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,403
Let's all go to bed.
Let go of this.

746
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,317
Go to bed.

747
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:09,487
Oh my gosh.

748
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:11,931
You must've been uncomfortable.
Why didn't you wake me?

749
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:14,141
You were sleeping so well.

750
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:17,804
Sorry, I have very bad sleeping habits.

751
00:45:17,804 --> 00:45:20,722
Did I do anything strange in my sleep?

752
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:23,472
No, nothing besides farting a few times.

753
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:25,005
It didn't smell much either.

754
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:36,601
Here you go.

755
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:38,472
Breakfast.

756
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:40,478
Goodness.

757
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:43,150
Hey, the bread is bleeding.

758
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:48,159
Cover your mouth when you yawn.
We have guests.

759
00:45:49,018 --> 00:45:50,909
I couldn't sleep
because it was uncomfortable.

760
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:51,914
What was uncomfortable?

761
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,518
Could it be comfortable sleeping
with a person I just met?

762
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,639
If I managed to fall asleep,
the baby would cry.

763
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:58,382
Or the baby's mom would snore.

764
00:45:58,382 --> 00:46:01,423
And that woman has a skill for
making people uncomfortable.

765
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:04,509
On top of that... What?

766
00:46:10,978 --> 00:46:14,096
I owe you a lot for yesterday.
I'll get going now.

767
00:46:14,096 --> 00:46:16,621
You have nowhere to go.
You can stay a few more days.

768
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,103
- What are you saying?
- She has nowhere to go.

769
00:46:19,103 --> 00:46:20,925
You are so inhumane.

770
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:23,115
No, I don't want to
burden you any longer.

771
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:24,994
Then have breakfast before going.

772
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:27,652
It's okay. I'm not hungry at all--

773
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,952
Sit down. I'll prepare it for you.

774
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:34,653
It's like thunder.

775
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:54,911
Take your time eating
and have some milk too.

776
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,891
Doo Shik is looking after Sol,
so don't worry.

777
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,541
I'll get more.

778
00:47:04,898 --> 00:47:06,413
What do I do?

779
00:47:06,413 --> 00:47:07,822
What is it? Why is she crying?

780
00:47:07,822 --> 00:47:09,496
I don't know.
She just started to cry.

781
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:10,532
I can't get her to stop.

782
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:12,378
Look at the time already.

783
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:15,047
Oh, thank you.

784
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:18,096
Sol, you were hungry, right?
I'm so sorry.

785
00:47:18,096 --> 00:47:19,896
I'll give you your food.

786
00:47:23,452 --> 00:47:24,922
Two more pieces of toast...

787
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:30,659
Oh, that shocked me.

788
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:31,777
What did I see?

789
00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:32,842
- Did you see?
- No.

790
00:47:32,842 --> 00:47:35,663
I told you that she makes people
feel uncomfortable.

791
00:47:38,373 --> 00:47:40,413
What's wrong? How strange.

792
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:42,677
What? What's the problem?

793
00:47:42,677 --> 00:47:45,175
She's not sucking out the milk.

794
00:47:45,175 --> 00:47:47,273
Then should we make formula milk?

795
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:50,010
No, Sol has a weak immune system.

796
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:52,184
I have to give her breast milk
until she's one.

797
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:55,181
Do I have to pump my breast?

798
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:56,849
Pump... pump it?

799
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:59,096
I don't have the breast pump.
This is a problem.

800
00:47:59,096 --> 00:48:00,943
What is a breast pump?
Do you know?

801
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:02,469
- How would I know?
- Ask her.

802
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:05,480
Excuse me.
What is a breast pump?

803
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,842
A breast pump is...

804
00:48:07,782 --> 00:48:09,407
a machine that gets breast milk out.

805
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:12,746
When a baby can't get breast milk out,
you pump out breast milk for them.

806
00:48:12,746 --> 00:48:16,144
Where... where do they sell that?

807
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,724
They would sell that in a
baby product store.

808
00:48:19,724 --> 00:48:23,744
But, it's a bit expensive
and I don't have money.

809
00:48:23,744 --> 00:48:25,655
All right. I'll buy it. I'll buy it.

810
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:29,172
Please just stay put.

811
00:48:29,893 --> 00:48:31,402
- I'll go.
- I'm coming too.

812
00:48:31,402 --> 00:48:32,927
I have a part-time job,
so I need to go.

813
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:34,949
Wait, guys!

814
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,657
Guys, take me with you too.

815
00:48:37,657 --> 00:48:40,197
We have guests so you can't go.
You stay here.

816
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:41,269
Yes, stay here.

817
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:42,632
- Sorry.
- Why?

818
00:48:42,632 --> 00:48:45,150
She makes me uncomfortable.
Take me with you.

819
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,721
Take care of things here, Chewbacca.

820
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,409
Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

821
00:48:57,927 --> 00:49:00,871
They say when you become a mom,
you only see your baby.

822
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,409
She just bares her breast
in front of all those men.

823
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,414
It was so shocking.

824
00:49:06,414 --> 00:49:07,748
I know, right?

825
00:49:08,514 --> 00:49:10,289
They have all sorts of things here.

826
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,969
What does a breast pump look like?

827
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,268
They sell clothes too.

828
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:19,840
It's just wide open here.

829
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,590
How could you wear this?

830
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,079
Hello, there.

831
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,110
The product you are looking at now
is a nursing outfit.

832
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,132
What is a nursing outfit?

833
00:49:30,132 --> 00:49:34,875
There are times when you go out with
a cute baby and she cries out of hunger.

834
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,673
When there are many people,
it can feel like too much to nurse.

835
00:49:38,673 --> 00:49:40,585
Do not worry.

836
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:43,909
You can pull this zipper up
and take your breast out.

837
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:47,487
You can breastfeed your baby without
worrying about the looks of others.

838
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:51,463
In other words,
it's like a pocket for your breast.

839
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:53,487
A pocket...

840
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:55,438
A pocket for your breast?

841
00:49:56,391 --> 00:49:58,318
Looks like there are
lots of interesting things.

842
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:00,989
What is this?

843
00:50:02,144 --> 00:50:03,666
Hello, there.

844
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:07,079
The product you are looking at
is a nursing pad.

845
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:08,333
What is a nursing pad?

846
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:11,436
When your baby is hungry and
sucking on the mother's breast

847
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:12,817
then what would happen next?

848
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:14,822
The baby takes its mouth
off the mother's breast.

849
00:50:14,822 --> 00:50:16,753
What do you think happens?

850
00:50:16,753 --> 00:50:21,764
Without a place to go,
breast milk sprays out like a fountain.

851
00:50:21,764 --> 00:50:24,871
That's when you would stick on
this nursing pad.

852
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:27,331
Phew. You can feel at ease.

853
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:32,391
It is a breast milk preserver,
to put it in other words.

854
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:34,164
Oh!

855
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:41,746
Is there something
you're looking for in particular?

856
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:44,137
I'm here for a breast pump.

857
00:50:59,992 --> 00:51:02,320
<i>It's awkward.
So awkward I feel like dying.</i>

858
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,039
<i>I have to say something... say something.</i>

859
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,757
Oh my. Your baby has
such defined eyebrows.

860
00:51:10,757 --> 00:51:13,090
Look at those chubby cheeks.

861
00:51:13,092 --> 00:51:14,923
He's like a general, a little prince.

862
00:51:14,923 --> 00:51:16,030
It's a girl.

863
00:51:17,652 --> 00:51:18,804
I see.

864
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:21,302
No wonder she had a boyish charm.

865
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:23,360
You know it's a trend
to have a girl crush look.

866
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,528
Her dad must adore her
since she's a girl.

867
00:51:25,528 --> 00:51:26,789
We broke up.

868
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,309
I see.

869
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,864
It's not a bad thing for a woman
to raise a child alone lately.

870
00:51:34,864 --> 00:51:35,965
Who needs a dad?

871
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:38,583
Grandma and Grandpa
can love her twice as much.

872
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:39,764
They passed away.

873
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,373
Both of them.

874
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,195
When I was two...

875
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:45,893
in a fire.

876
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:55,927
<i>Dong Gu, hurry up.</i>

877
00:51:55,927 --> 00:51:58,099
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry!</i>

878
00:51:59,664 --> 00:52:02,710
There are manual breast pumps.

879
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,699
There are automatic breast pumps too.

880
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:08,880
With this manual breast pump,
put his funnel shape against the breast.

881
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,438
Stick it there and pull this here.

882
00:52:16,148 --> 00:52:18,802
That is the system
to pump the breast milk.

883
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,215
With the automatic breast pump,
you merely press this button.

884
00:52:22,215 --> 00:52:24,376
It will pump 40 to 50 times
in one minute.

885
00:52:31,373 --> 00:52:35,018
Just give us anything.
Stop explaining.

886
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,715
I'm begging you, please.

887
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:42,197
My trauma level is at terminator levels.

888
00:52:42,197 --> 00:52:43,443
Right?

889
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:45,210
Yeah.

890
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:48,931
Should I take something to
help with my nerves?

891
00:52:49,563 --> 00:52:50,625
Okay.

892
00:52:51,286 --> 00:52:54,175
Hey, there's Su Ah.

893
00:52:55,855 --> 00:52:57,085
Dong Gu, there's Su Ah...

894
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,161
Dong Gu. Kang Dong Gu.

895
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,030
What are you doing there?

896
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:08,188
Huh? Oh, there's
a foundation column here.

897
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,969
Oh, it's strong.

898
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:13,719
Of course, it's strong.
Would it be weak then?

899
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,550
Are you by chance...
Hey, Su Ah!

900
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:19,094
What are you doing?

901
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:22,152
Don't do that. Don't!
What are you doing?

902
00:53:22,152 --> 00:53:24,869
- Don't do that.
- Hey, man.

903
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:28,414
Get on your knees and beg
if you can't forget her.

904
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:31,025
Why? What did I do wrong
that I should beg?

905
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:33,346
Getting caught selling your couple ring
wasn't so great.

906
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:35,135
Well, that...

907
00:53:35,135 --> 00:53:37,398
I told you not to bring that.
I told you not to.

908
00:53:38,438 --> 00:53:40,498
It's obvious you still have feelings.

909
00:53:40,498 --> 00:53:42,447
I do not. I do not!

910
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,697
Okay, keep that pride of yours.

911
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,059
Live your whole life with regrets.

912
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,503
Su Ah went that way.

913
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:52,603
I'm going that way. Bye.

914
00:53:52,603 --> 00:53:54,764
- You stay.
- Wait up.

915
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,014
Just go then.

916
00:54:20,976 --> 00:54:22,461
<i>I don't know then.</i>

917
00:54:22,461 --> 00:54:24,500
<i>It's not like pride will keep me full.</i>

918
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,677
<i>I'll just get on my knees.</i>

919
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:28,900
<i>Better than regretting it
for the rest of my life.</i>

920
00:54:39,222 --> 00:54:41,152
Hey, there. Su--

921
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,375
Su Ah!

922
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:46,503
Yoon Seok.
Why were you so late?

923
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:50,369
I'm sorry. I'll buy you
delicious pasta to make up for it.

924
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:51,688
Let's go.

925
00:54:55,246 --> 00:54:57,456
- What's wrong with him?
- What is it?

926
00:54:57,456 --> 00:55:00,438
He suddenly fainted. Hold on.

927
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:03,420
Excuse me. Are you okay?

928
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,958
Are you sick?

929
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:09,036
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

930
00:55:11,614 --> 00:55:12,980
Excuse me.

931
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,802
Let me see your face. Excuse me.

932
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,253
Hold on a little longer.

933
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:21,664
Oh! Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

934
00:55:22,163 --> 00:55:24,288
What took you so long?

935
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:26,489
What's with you?
I can't breathe!

936
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:28,655
It was so awkward.

937
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:31,516
I thought I was going to a mental
hospital because of this breast pump.

938
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:33,257
Why? Did something happen?

939
00:55:33,257 --> 00:55:35,643
I don't know. Don't ask.
I don't want to think about it.

940
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:37,800
- That's what I'm saying.
- Be quiet. Go inside.

941
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,106
Go on in.

942
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:42,420
Yoon Ah, here's the pump.

943
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,199
Thank you. Sorry to be a nuisance.

944
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:47,318
Don't say such a thing.
Sol must be hungry.

945
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:48,903
You should feed her.

946
00:55:48,903 --> 00:55:52,503
Sol, you must be very hungry.
Let's feed you.

947
00:55:54,204 --> 00:55:56,271
So, this is what it looks like.

948
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:04,041
Why is she doing that?

949
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:06,922
I told you she makes people
really uncomfortable.

950
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:10,380
What's wrong with this?

951
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,302
What now? What... what is it?

952
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:15,072
The breast milk still isn't coming out.

953
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,829
I think the milk ducts are clogged.
That's a problem.

954
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:21,217
What? Yoo Sun? Is that a person?
("Yoo Sun" sounds like "milk duct")

955
00:56:21,217 --> 00:56:25,545
There's a duct in the breast where
the milk comes from and it's clogged.

956
00:56:25,545 --> 00:56:27,331
What do you need to do for that?

957
00:56:27,331 --> 00:56:29,827
It opens up with a massage.

958
00:56:29,827 --> 00:56:32,427
It costs a lot to get a massage.

959
00:56:32,427 --> 00:56:35,268
Okay, I'll get a loan to get one for you.

960
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:37,809
Please sit still!

961
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:44,364
What? 100,000 won for one?

962
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:46,365
It really is expensive.

963
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:48,925
- Can you come now?
- What?

964
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:50,945
That won't do.

965
00:56:51,795 --> 00:56:54,148
- All right.
- They can't come?

966
00:56:54,148 --> 00:56:56,905
They're fully booked and
can't come until next week.

967
00:56:57,467 --> 00:56:58,728
What do we do?

968
00:56:58,728 --> 00:57:00,224
There's nothing we can do.

969
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:03,692
What is it?

970
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:05,766
My breasts are swollen
so they're in pain.

971
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:07,083
That's a big problem.

972
00:57:10,657 --> 00:57:13,726
What? Why are you looking at me?

973
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:15,159
- You try it.
- What?

974
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:17,260
- What do you mean?
- Massage.

975
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,813
Try massaging.

976
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:20,983
Is it a big deal?
You just squeeze and it's a massage.

977
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:24,326
Are you crazy telling me to
massage a stranger's breasts?

978
00:57:24,326 --> 00:57:26,351
Should I do it then?
Of course, I want to do it.

979
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:28,422
I would love to give it a try.

980
00:57:28,422 --> 00:57:30,590
- Should I close my eyes and try?
- Are you crazy?

981
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,530
So, you should try.

982
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,998
Don't you feel bad
for Yoon Ah, who's in pain?

983
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:36,007
Ah, it hurts.

984
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:39,751
I do feel bad for her, but still...

985
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:41,873
How can I massage someone's breasts?

986
00:57:41,873 --> 00:57:43,983
No, I'm really okay.

987
00:57:46,557 --> 00:57:47,695
Oh, that hurts.

988
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:53,335
I'm going crazy here.

989
00:57:55,637 --> 00:57:56,775
I'm going crazy.

990
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,003
Excuse me. Are you okay?

991
00:58:05,172 --> 00:58:07,306
<i>I'm really going crazy.</i>

992
00:58:07,306 --> 00:58:10,105
<i>Go! Just go, man.</i>

993
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:12,405
Yoon Seok, let's go now.

994
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:17,065
How can we leave a sick person here?

995
00:58:17,065 --> 00:58:21,456
<i>Just leave me.
Leave me and just go!</i>

996
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,005
Over here.

997
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:30,561
Did you call it in?

998
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:33,567
He suddenly fainted
and can't seem to get up.

999
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:35,594
I think he hurt his face.

1000
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:36,653
Really?

1001
00:58:38,574 --> 00:58:40,985
Sir, can you hear me?

1002
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,255
Try getting up.

1003
00:58:43,775 --> 00:58:45,525
Gosh, this won't do.

1004
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:47,224
We'll have to force him up.

1005
00:58:48,418 --> 00:58:51,007
All right. One, two!

1006
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:56,409
Sir, don't fight it.

1007
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:58,670
One, two!

1008
00:59:01,565 --> 00:59:04,436
Is something wrong?
I think he needs to go to a big hospital.

1009
00:59:04,436 --> 00:59:06,242
Hold on.

1010
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,605
Okay, I'll get up.

1011
00:59:09,605 --> 00:59:11,262
Are you awake now?

1012
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:15,472
<i>I'll be totally embarrassed
if I get caught here.</i>

1013
00:59:15,472 --> 00:59:17,005
<i>Gosh, who cares?</i>

1014
00:59:48,065 --> 00:59:49,157
Sir?

1015
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:53,768
Are you okay?

1016
00:59:55,123 --> 00:59:58,380
Oh no. He must have hurt his head.

1017
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,208
I will get started now.

1018
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,679
I'm so tired.

1019
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,130
When can I stop working part-time jobs?

1020
01:00:49,969 --> 01:00:53,701
I'm probably the only CEO who works
part-time to keep his business afloat.

1021
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,211
What's this?

1022
01:01:06,391 --> 01:01:07,750
How is it going?

1023
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:20,882
How did it go?
Did you succeed?

1024
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:22,853
Can't you tell by seeing?

1025
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,744
I thought the milk gland exploded.

1026
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:27,268
What a relief.

1027
01:01:27,777 --> 01:01:29,161
You worked hard.

1028
01:01:29,161 --> 01:01:31,362
I'm proud of you. I'm so proud.

1029
01:01:31,362 --> 01:01:33,592
Be quiet. Where's the breast pump?

1030
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:34,793
Bring it now.

1031
01:01:34,793 --> 01:01:37,135
The pump is in the living room.

1032
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:40,853
Is Yoon Ah older than you?

1033
01:01:40,853 --> 01:01:43,030
You look much older than her.

1034
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,150
What?

1035
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,860
I haven't had a workout lately,
so I'm feeling antsy.

1036
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,442
I'm just joking.

1037
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:49,884
Joke, yeah right.

1038
01:01:49,884 --> 01:01:52,362
Joke, joke, joke.
It was a joke.

1039
01:01:52,362 --> 01:01:53,954
I told you it was a joke.

1040
01:01:53,954 --> 01:01:56,675
Ah, this feels great.

1041
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:01,077
Let go.

1042
01:02:01,077 --> 01:02:05,119
Hey! What are you doing,
you crazy punk!

1043
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,536
- What did I do?
- What, what?

1044
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:10,318
Why, why, why, why?

1045
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:12,405
Do you know what this is
to put on your body?

1046
01:02:12,405 --> 01:02:14,487
Why are you hitting me?
Isn't it a massage machine?

1047
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:15,507
Massage machine?

1048
01:02:15,507 --> 01:02:18,530
You punk, it's a pump for breast milk...

1049
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,081
What? It feels great. Try it.

1050
01:02:20,081 --> 01:02:22,565
Try it? You little punk!

1051
01:02:22,565 --> 01:02:25,411
Do you know how much this is?

1052
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:26,673
You punk!

1053
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,690
You just need to do well.

1054
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,942
Oh, why do you look like that?

1055
01:02:33,942 --> 01:02:35,012
Did something happen?

1056
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:37,041
Don't ask me anything.
Not a thing.

1057
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:42,315
Why is it so quiet here?

1058
01:02:43,164 --> 01:02:44,675
- Where are the guests?
- Hm?

1059
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:46,733
They're having a party on the roof.

1060
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:48,864
I made pork belly for them
and they loved it.

1061
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:51,378
Yeah? Good job.

1062
01:02:52,217 --> 01:02:55,393
Ah, did that woman and the baby leave?

1063
01:02:55,393 --> 01:02:58,842
Huh? Yeah, she left. She did.

1064
01:02:59,353 --> 01:03:01,485
Yeah, that's good.

1065
01:03:01,942 --> 01:03:05,512
Doesn't the house feel empty
without any noise though?

1066
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:08,384
I wonder if Yoon Ah is okay with
nowhere to go?

1067
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,802
- I'm worried.
- So worried.

1068
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:10,824
Right, Dong Gu?

1069
01:03:10,824 --> 01:03:12,864
Yeah, she could've stayed here.

1070
01:03:12,864 --> 01:03:15,581
You're really worried too, right?

1071
01:03:15,581 --> 01:03:19,106
What is this?
Why are you all acting suspicious?

1072
01:03:19,106 --> 01:03:22,851
You're all hiding something, right?

1073
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:24,108
No, we're not!

1074
01:03:24,108 --> 01:03:25,710
What would we hide?

1075
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,896
- Yeah, no way.
- No.

1076
01:03:33,454 --> 01:03:36,983
What is that? Isn't that a crying baby?

1077
01:03:36,983 --> 01:03:39,005
What? I didn't hear anything.

1078
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:41,206
- I didn't hear anything.
- Me neither.

1079
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:45,802
Hey, Seo Jin.

1080
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:48,195
I think my milk glands are clogged again.

1081
01:03:52,222 --> 01:03:54,090
Why... why is she here?

1082
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,748
You said she left. You said so.

1083
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,344
Who? Her?

1084
01:03:57,344 --> 01:03:59,682
That's not Yoon Ah.
That's someone else.

1085
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:01,902
Yes, Yoo Sun. I'll be right there!

1086
01:04:02,485 --> 01:04:05,018
Oh, really? I see.

1087
01:04:05,018 --> 01:04:08,320
You think I'm a fool.
What's with you?

1088
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,548
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1089
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:13,210
Don't you have pity for Yoon Ah?

1090
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,922
We may not have money,
but we have humanity.

1091
01:04:15,922 --> 01:04:18,407
- I don't.
- Hey!

1092
01:04:18,407 --> 01:04:20,282
Hey, stop that.

1093
01:04:20,282 --> 01:04:22,735
Let go of me. Let go!

1094
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:24,405
Hey, stop that.

1095
01:04:24,405 --> 01:04:27,443
Dong Gu, let's just let her stay here.

1096
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:30,697
Yoon Ah, go inside. Get inside!

1097
01:04:30,697 --> 01:04:32,380
Get inside. Go in.
