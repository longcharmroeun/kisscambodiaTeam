1
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:12,715
What is this?

2
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,955
Then say, "I like you."

3
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:20,065
Dong Gu. I like you.

4
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,720
- Trying to be cute. - I really like you.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,820
Be brave.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,765
I really like you.

7
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:42,945
What is this?

8
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:54,795
I like you.

9
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:56,835
I really like you, Dong Gu.

10
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:02,005
Would you be willing to start a relationship with me?

11
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:05,235
Yoon Ah.

12
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:20,685
Really? She asked you out?

13
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:23,110
Gosh, you succeeded at last!

14
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm so jealous, Dong Gu.

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,850
Congratulations. That's good news.

16
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,695
- Congratulations, Dong Gu. - Thanks.

17
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,395
But this does feel a little weird.

18
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:34,660
I'm congratulating my ex-boyfriend for dating a new girl.

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,165
Am I supposed to do this?

20
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,060
You're so cool.

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,530
You're like a human dry ice.

22
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,405
I can see breath coming out of your mouth.

23
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,315
She's here. Dong Gu's girl is here.

24
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:51,655
Yoon Ah, give it to me.

25
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:53,610
You're up early.

26
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,855
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

27
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:57,925
What are you doing today? Do you go to baking class?

28
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,450
- Yes. - What are you doing afterwards?

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,795
- Are you going to the bakery? - Yes.

30
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,305
I see.

31
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:12,175
Sol must be awake.

32
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:18,640
What is wrong with you guys?

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,885
- Are you sure you two are dating? - Yes.

34
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,610
She asked me out yesterday, saying she wanted a serious relationship.

35
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,410
So she said that you two are dating?

36
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,555
We didn't need to say that out loud.

37
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:30,380
Of course.

38
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,280
If she didn't say it, you're not together yet.

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,925
- Am I wrong? - What?

40
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,620
Jun Ki is right. You're not together yet.

41
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,735
Really?

42
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:41,360
Yoon Ah and I are not together yet?

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,660
If you're not sure, why don't you go and ask her?

44
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,430
I can't ask her now.

45
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,170
What if it turns out later that you weren't dating?

46
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,305
Maybe you're right.

47
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,645
I should probably go and ask her.

48
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,140
He's really going to ask her.

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,410
Is he stupid?

50
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,695
Guys, everyone becomes stupid when they're in love.

51
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,655
But I think he really is stupid.

52
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:10,220
- Be quiet. - Why are you leaving me out?

53
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,260
Gosh.

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,490
Is it fun to pull his leg?

55
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,190
It's really fun.

56
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,390
I think so.

57
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,635
I agree.

58
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,705
- Stop it. - Aren't you going to laugh?

59
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:29,215
Yoon Ah, can I come in?

60
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:30,915
Yes.

61
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:44,195
Yoon Ah, can I ask you something?

62
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,495
Yes.

63
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:47,505
Well...

64
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:51,005
Do you remember saying that you like me last night?

65
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,145
You sent me a video where you say you like me.

66
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:56,205
You said you wanted to go out with me.

67
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:58,615
We laughed together too.

68
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,075
Yes.

69
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:04,055
Let me ask you something.

70
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:06,015
Are we together?

71
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:08,185
Yes.

72
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,595
I knew it. We're together, right?

73
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,650
See? I was right.

74
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,665
Those brats.

75
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:21,535
- I'll leave you alone now. - Okay.

76
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,045
It's so funny.

77
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:30,775
Did you ask her?

78
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:31,900
What did she say?

79
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,770
She said we're together.

80
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,815
What did I say?

81
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,055
Really?

82
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:40,410
But her reaction was a bit off.

83
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,080
What are you talking about?

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,380
Think about it.

85
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,080
You have a crush on someone.

86
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,250
You ask that person out, and you're finally together.

87
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,590
How would you feel?

88
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,320
I'd be on cloud nine.

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,490
Right?

90
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,260
And you are right now.

91
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
Yes.

92
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,060
But Yoon Ah doesn't seem to be excited at all.

93
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,905
Don't you agree, Du Shik?

94
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:03,940
He's right.

95
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,945
She seems to be a bit depressed, almost in pain.

96
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:08,645
You think so?

97
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:12,115
It's been bothering me a bit too.

98
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,225
Could...

99
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:16,785
Yoon Ah be regretting?

100
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,150
Regret what?

101
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,750
Sometimes, you ask someone out...

102
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,920
but regret it the next morning.

103
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,065
Right, Du Shik?

104
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:29,260
Of course.

105
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,760
I have no such experience,

106
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,305
but that happens all the time in movies and novels.

107
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:34,905
That's not okay.

108
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,700
That's really not okay.

109
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,170
Then why don't you...

110
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,200
take her on a date?

111
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,980
Win some points before she changes her mind.

112
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:45,555
Otherwise, you might get dumped again.

113
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,155
That's not okay.

114
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:04,605
(For New Couples)

115
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:06,005
Yes.

116
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,975
Dong Gu and Yoon Ah are having a date.

117
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:11,775
Lunch?

118
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,245
Yes, I had lunch.

119
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:17,055
Did you enjoy your lunch, Bacca?

120
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:20,250
Gosh.

121
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,350
Has his tongue gotten shorter?

122
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,695
I miss you too.

123
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:26,425
See you later.

124
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:28,765
Hang up first.

125
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:32,095
You should hang up first, Bacca.

126
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,835
Gosh.

127
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:36,935
What are you doing?

128
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,030
You're being so childish.

129
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,405
Right, Du Shik?

130
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,975
I want to be childish too.

131
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:47,785
Jun Ki and Dong Gu are enjoying the spring,

132
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:50,815
but it's still winter for me. Right, Sol?

133
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:54,010
Go on a date.

134
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,950
You're sitting right next to another lonely person.

135
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,155
Who?

136
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,125
Sol?

137
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:02,725
This girl? Soo Ah?

138
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,320
Yes.

139
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,235
You're both lonely. Why don't you rely on each other?

140
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:09,560
Are you crazy?

141
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,105
How could you tell me to go out with this idiot?

142
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:13,830
Hey.

143
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,030
I don't want to go out with someone who...

144
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,500
doesn't know anything about math and Crown Prince Sado.

145
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,875
- Are you serious? - I take it back.

146
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,510
Anyway, I'll never go out with her.

147
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,415
- Don't say such a thing again. - Okay.

148
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:25,685
I hate the idea too.

149
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,185
You're being ridiculous.

150
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:31,155
Gosh, I hate how she looks from behind too.

151
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:35,150
Sol, I don't want you to grow up to be an ignorant person like her.

152
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,320
You should...

153
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,365
read newspapers and become smart.

154
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,660
Let's see if there's anything fun to read.

155
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,660
(Frustrated Breadwinners)

156
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,335
"Frustrated Breadwinners".

157
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:46,705
"Layoff"...

158
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,000
That sounds terrible, right?

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,370
Of course.

160
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,810
How will they face their wives and children?

161
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,385
This is why I'm not sure if I should get married.

162
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,785
Don't worry.

163
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,610
You won't be able to.

164
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,525
How can you say such a terrible thing?

165
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:07,965
What's that?

166
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:13,965
Culture centers these days have so many different classes.

167
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:16,430
"Develop Your Baby's Five Senses".

168
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,005
(Develop Your Baby's Five Senses)

169
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,645
Wait.

170
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:23,405
What's this sound?

171
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,075
Where is it coming from?

172
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:28,540
Is it the sound of your heart beating?

173
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,185
Jun Ki, I think,

174
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:33,585
I'm in love.

175
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:35,125
With whom?

176
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:36,585
This woman?

177
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:39,855
All you've seen is a picture of her. Don't be ridiculous.

178
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:44,695
I'm going to the culture center!

179
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:48,065
- What are you doing? Get up. - Me?

180
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:51,130
No. Bacca would get angry.

181
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,530
I'm not telling you to date her.

182
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,405
I'll date her. I just want you to come with me.

183
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,600
Let's go.

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,370
Let's go to the culture center!

185
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,315
Let me finally be childish!

186
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,255
Why is Yoon Ah so quiet?

187
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:10,995
She looks a bit down.

188
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:14,825
Does she really regret her decision to go out with me?

189
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:16,595
That would be a problem.

190
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:18,935
The weather is so nice.

191
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,790
Yoon Ah, what should we do?

192
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,435
Should we eat first?

193
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:25,605
Yes.

194
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:28,905
What should we eat?

195
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,700
Should we eat your favorite, sundae?

196
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,815
Yes.

197
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:34,985
Should we go eat now?

198
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,215
Yes.

199
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,240
What is this?

200
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,285
Why does she only say yes?

201
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,085
She doesn't want to talk to me?

202
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:45,325
Gosh, I'm getting so worried.

203
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,695
I feel so uncomfortable.

204
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,800
What is this on our first date?

205
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,975
Gosh.

206
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,375
I should really change the mood.

207
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,275
Yoon Ah.

208
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:05,970
What should we do after eating?

209
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,470
As the weather is nice, why don't we go to an amusement park?

210
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,615
Okay.

211
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:13,710
Do you like to go on rides?

212
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,785
Yes.

213
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,395
- Honey. - Okay.

214
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:25,435
Does it taste good?

215
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:32,330
- Yoon Ah. - Yes?

216
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,745
Open your mouth. Let me feed you.

217
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,430
I'm okay.

218
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,600
I want to.

219
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,770
Open your mouth.

220
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,610
I'm really okay. I can eat by myself.

221
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,640
Come on. I really want to feed you.

222
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,240
No. I'm okay.

223
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,825
Don't be like that.

224
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,355
I'm really okay.

225
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:55,565
Yoon Ah, are you okay?

226
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:58,490
My eyes.

227
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,490
I think I have salt in my eyes.

228
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,835
I have to use the bathroom.

229
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:06,235
Yoon Ah, I'm sorry.

230
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:07,405
Yoon Ah.

231
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,105
My goodness.

232
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:18,810
Du Shik, don't you have a feeling that...

233
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,685
they're getting the wrong idea about us?

234
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,785
What do you mean?

235
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:26,655
You have something on your lips.

236
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:32,895
What are you doing?

237
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:35,405
They already have the wrong idea. Are you out of your mind?

238
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,500
Get away from me. Get away.

239
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:38,975
What?

240
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:41,105
Hello. Hello.

241
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:46,675
Hello.

242
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,970
Are you alone with your baby?

243
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,115
Yes.

244
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,385
I thought we were the only men here.

245
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:55,225
What a pleasant surprise.

246
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,920
The thing is, I run a business.

247
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,380
I'm usually too busy...

248
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,325
to spend any time with my baby.

249
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:04,320
So I set some time aside for this class.

250
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,765
- That's great. - I see.

251
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:10,735
Is the instructor married?

252
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:13,030
Well, I don't think she is.

253
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,405
I see.

254
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:15,900
That's great.

255
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,615
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

256
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:21,610
We have some fathers here today.

257
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,215
Nice to see you all.

258
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:27,185
Are you angry?

259
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:28,650
Why are you all so quiet?

260
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,755
Please applaud them.

261
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,150
Today, we'll learn...

262
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,795
a massage that's good for pooping.

263
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:39,290
Please put the mats and oil baskets back to where you found them.

264
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,535
Get up.

265
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,900
Are you Sol's uncles?

266
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,705
How was the one-day trial?

267
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:48,900
If you're pleased,

268
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,900
- would you like to register today? - I'd like to refuse.

269
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,570
Please reconsider it.

270
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,940
Consistent massage helps with body development.

271
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,080
No thank you.

272
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:00,415
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

273
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,185
Come on. Let's go home.

274
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,555
Okay.

275
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:14,165
(Soorgio Armhany)

276
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,075
Where did you go?

277
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:22,640
We've witnessed a side effect of Korean ITC technology.

278
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:25,945
- You made us tired over nothing. - I'm sorry.

279
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:32,515
Are you digesting better after a massage?

280
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,980
Her pooping sound is louder than before.

281
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,155
You're right. I'll bring a diaper.

282
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:41,125
Let's change your diaper.

283
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,595
Is this the same diaper?

284
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:45,295
What?

285
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,400
- Du Shik. - Yes?

286
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:51,960
Did the instructor say that the massage creates a thing,

287
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,330
that wasn't there before?

288
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,730
- Why? Did Sol get something new? - Yes.

289
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,175
- What? - A penis.

290
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,485
What? This isn't Sol.

291
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:07,115
It isn't her.

292
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:09,555
I thought something was strange about him.

293
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,595
What do you mean that she isn't Sol?

294
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,390
Where did she go?

295
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,750
Where did Sol go?

296
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,420
Du Shik.

297
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,435
- We must have switched babies. - What?

298
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:20,420
Why didn't you check the baby?

299
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,660
You hurried me, so I didn't have time.

300
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,700
Be quiet. It's not time to fight.

301
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,360
Go and get Sol now.

302
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,805
Okay.

303
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:32,470
- Sol. - Sol.

304
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,845
Goodness.

305
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:47,225
I'm sorry, Yoon Ah.

306
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,025
Is your eye okay?

307
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,995
Yes.

308
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,995
- Can you get on the rides? - Yes.

309
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:56,160
What should I do?

310
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,800
She looks unhappier than before.

311
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:00,405
I have to change the mood.

312
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:02,875
I must make up for my mistake.

313
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:08,170
That's it.

314
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,940
It has the right amount of thrill and physical contact.

315
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,910
It's the best ride to lift up the mood and show my masculinity.

316
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,355
Yoon Ah, shall we go on the Viking ride?

317
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:20,225
Pardon? Okay.

318
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:21,995
Let's go.

319
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:26,430
Viking ride starts now.

320
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:28,065
The security bar is going down.

321
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:32,805
I haven't ridden it in a long time.

322
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,070
Yoon Ah, hold tightly.

323
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:37,275
Okay.

324
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,975
If it's too scary,

325
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:43,345
you can lean on me, okay?

326
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:44,915
Okay.

327
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:47,485
Let's go.

328
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,755
Let's go to the unknown world.

329
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,035
- Aren't you scared? - No.

330
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:14,585
Was the Viking ride always this scary?

331
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:18,510
What's going on?

332
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,385
Why is it going up so high?

333
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,125
It's too high.

334
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:32,965
It's too scary. Stop.

335
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:35,165
Stop, stop.

336
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:36,535
Stop!

337
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:39,930
Sir, please stop it.

338
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,845
Please let me off.

339
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:49,240
Sir, sir.

340
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,615
Let me get off.

341
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:59,220
Calm down, Dong Gu.

342
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:02,695
- Let me get off now. - It's okay. It'll stop soon.

343
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:07,165
The security bar is going up.

344
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:12,535
Dong Gu, it's okay now. Get up.

345
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,805
- Are you sure? - Yes.

346
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:21,145
It really stopped.

347
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,415
I almost died.

348
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,185
Yoon Ah, I'm sorry.

349
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:30,155
I'm really sorry.

350
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:36,195
Goodness.

351
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,165
What should I do?

352
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:42,105
Dong Gu.

353
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:47,305
It's hard enough to earn money.

354
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,600
Do I have to make side dishes...

355
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,775
and prepare for the ancestral ceremony?

356
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:56,145
What have I done?

357
00:17:58,325 --> 00:17:59,950
- Hello? - Hello?

358
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,685
Are you Hee Dong's father?

359
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm Sol's uncle. We met at the cultural center.

360
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,525
Yes, what's going on?

361
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:10,195
I think the babies were switched.

362
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:12,135
We have Hee Dong.

363
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:14,665
I think you have Sol.

364
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:17,635
What? That's nonsense.

365
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,105
What's wrong? What happened?

366
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:25,775
It's nothing.

367
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,515
Meet me at the 2nd floor restroom in 1 minute.

368
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,685
Why isn't he here yet?

369
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:38,820
Du Shik, I don't know about us.

370
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:41,920
How could a father not realize that his baby was switched?

371
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,995
Is he really a dad? He isn't qualified to be a dad.

372
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,495
- Hee Dong. - Hee Dong.

373
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:51,675
- Sir, where's Sol? - Yes?

374
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:54,330
Let me explain first.

375
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,205
What do you mean? Where is she?

376
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:59,900
I'm sorry, but may I ask you a favor?

377
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,585
What favor?

378
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:04,915
Actually, I'm unemployed.

379
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,050
I've been staying home for two years, since I got laid off.

380
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,955
With money that my wife earns,

381
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,895
I'm living a miserable life.

382
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,665
- So what? - My wife looks down on me...

383
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:17,160
for not being competent.

384
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:20,565
She'll divorce me if she finds out that our babies were switched.

385
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:22,360
What do you want us to do?

386
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,330
Can we switch the babies without letting my wife know?

387
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,770
What? Are you kidding me?

388
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,775
Be quiet and bring Sol to us now.

389
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:33,545
It was too much to ask. I understand.

390
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:37,015
I'll just let her divorce me.

391
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:38,685
Let's go.

392
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:42,485
Wait, I understand.

393
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:45,395
What should we do?

394
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:49,295
I have a good plan.

395
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:57,665
Look at cacao nibs over there.

396
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,875
I like cacao nibs.

397
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,175
Goodness.

398
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,545
It's "buy one, get one free".

399
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:12,985
The price is quite low.

400
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:20,325
Goodness, Sol.

401
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:22,995
These aren't cheap.

402
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:40,745
How long do we have to do this?

403
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:43,840
What else can we do if she divorces him?

404
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,980
I feel bad for him.

405
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,310
Why did you suggest going to the class in the first place?

406
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,550
You're the one who switched babies.

407
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,910
Are you blaming me now?

408
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,995
- Gosh. - Gosh.

409
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:55,665
Where is that man? What is he doing?

410
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:57,525
You startled me.

411
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:01,130
Sir, what are you doing?

412
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,365
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,435
I'm afraid that my wife will find out.

414
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:07,270
- Can you sit down for a moment? - Huh?

415
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:10,400
- Can you keep on the lookout? - What?

416
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,245
Stop looking in this direction.

417
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:20,140
Until when will you do this?

418
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,255
I'm sorry. Consider it that you're saving me.

419
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,180
Please help me a little more.

420
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,450
I want to help you,

421
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,020
but your wife won't give us a chance.

422
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,225
Speaking of which,

423
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:33,195
I have a plan that will work.

424
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:36,935
What is it this time?

425
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:50,715
Here's the plan.

426
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:54,010
The only place where we can secretly exchange...

427
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,455
Hee Dong and Sol is at the cashier.

428
00:21:56,955 --> 00:22:00,355
It's the place where she'll take her eyes off of the baby carriage.

429
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:04,495
Once everything is scanned, the cashier will say this.

430
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:06,190
The total is 158 dollars.

431
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,365
Would you like to pay in cash or credit card?

432
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:09,890
I'll pay with a credit card.

433
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,530
Then she'll take her hands off of the baby carriage...

434
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,870
and take out her wallet.

435
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,175
We have five seconds, until she takes out her card.

436
00:22:17,345 --> 00:22:19,670
- Do you have a membership card? - Let me enter my number.

437
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,115
It takes five seconds to enter her number.

438
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:24,915
The cashier will swipe the card.

439
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:26,985
It takes five seconds for the receipt to be printed.

440
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:28,955
It's a total of 15 seconds.

441
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:32,050
These 15 seconds will be our last chance...

442
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,625
to swap Hee Dong and Sol.

443
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,760
The signal to make our move will be...

444
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,960
"Will you be paying with cash or with a credit card?"

445
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,730
That'll be the signal. Keep that in mind.

446
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,905
That'll be 158 dollars.

447
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:51,200
Will you be paying with cash or with a credit card?

448
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,045
- I'll pay with a credit card. - Yes, ma'am.

449
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:19,705
Sol. Be quiet.

450
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,705
Wait. What are you doing?

451
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,545
Well, you see...

452
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:58,275
Why are you carrying my baby?

453
00:23:59,215 --> 00:24:00,345
Pardon?

454
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:01,945
Well, you see...

455
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,715
Mister.

456
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:07,715
Wait. Do you know this person, honey?

457
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:10,220
No. I've never seen this person before.

458
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:12,020
What? Hey, Mister.

459
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,825
What are you talking about?

460
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:15,450
Who are you?

461
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,550
Who are you? How dare you touch our Hee Dong?

462
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,465
Mister. What are you doing?

463
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:22,335
How dare you touch our Hee Dong?

464
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,560
My wife met a useless husband like me.

465
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,705
Hye Sook's working her socks off to make a living.

466
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:31,375
She hasn't even been able to travel abroad like others.

467
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,100
I've never bought her a nice piece of clothes.

468
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,670
Hye Sook's my kind-hearted wife...

469
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,140
and Hee Dong's the fruition of our love.

470
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,115
How dare you try to hurt them.

471
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:40,710
If you're going to hurt my family,

472
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,880
I'd rather have you kill me, you scum.

473
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,180
- What? - Why would I kill anyone?

474
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,950
You were the one that told us about the 15 seconds.

475
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,595
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth, you scum.

476
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:54,765
Whatever your name is,

477
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,490
please just act like you don't know me.

478
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,675
I beg you.

479
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:00,635
Whatever your name is,

480
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:03,130
but you've gone too far.

481
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,645
Please help this useless breadwinner.

482
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,215
All right. You caught me.

483
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,885
I can't imagine a more amazing husband than you.

484
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:18,355
Ma'am.

485
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:21,865
You should be grateful that you have an amazing husband like him.

486
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:24,595
I'll be going then.

487
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,265
Leave.

488
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,935
Get lost and never come back again, you scums!

489
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:34,805
- Honey. - Yes?

490
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:39,045
I never knew that you thought of me that much.

491
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:41,545
Honey.

492
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:49,610
Thank you, whatever your name is.

493
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,085
Don't mention it.

494
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:54,625
The breadwinners of Korea, cheer up.

495
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,235
Yoon Ah. I'm sorry.

496
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:09,905
I felt so nauseous, and I couldn't help it.

497
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:12,975
You're not upset, are you?

498
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,375
No.

499
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:17,815
You're not angry, are you?

500
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:20,615
No.

501
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:23,050
She's angry. She's angry.

502
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:25,555
She has that grim look on her face.

503
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:29,250
I smacked her eye with a sundae and threw up on her skirt.

504
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,925
Who wouldn't get upset?

505
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:34,595
I'm ruined. She's regretting it for sure.

506
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:36,035
Yoon Ah.

507
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:38,635
Aren't you thirsty? Do you want me to get some soda for you?

508
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:40,135
Yes.

509
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:43,775
Wait just a minute.

510
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:08,090
It's over. It's all over.

511
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,160
She has a grim look on her face and only says, "Yes."

512
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,705
I'm sure she's regretting that she agreed to start dating me.

513
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:17,205
I'm ruined.

514
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:19,545
I'm ruined.

515
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:30,955
(Seo Jin)

516
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,325
Yes, Seo Jin. We're on our way home.

517
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:36,925
Is Sol doing all right?

518
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:39,490
Of course.

519
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,835
Sol was fine all day.

520
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:45,905
How about you? Did you enjoy your date?

521
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:48,830
Actually, since I was with Dong Gu on my own,

522
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,915
I was so nervous that I didn't know what to say.

523
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:53,470
My mind was blank all day.

524
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,115
All I could say to him was, "Yes."

525
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:59,910
What if he's upset with me?

526
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,825
I'm worried to death.

527
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,980
Anyhow, I'm so flustered right now.

528
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,855
Let's talk when I get home.

529
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:09,395
Yes. All right.

530
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:15,565
Dong Gu.

531
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:22,775
So that's the reason.

532
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:26,845
I didn't know.

533
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,175
Pardon?

534
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:34,585
Dong Gu.

535
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,625
Are you crying?

536
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:43,995
You see, since you...

537
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:47,795
didn't talk so much and had a grim look on your face,

538
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:51,400
I was worried that you might be regretting to date me.

539
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:54,305
That was all I could think of all day. I was so worried.

540
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:58,175
I was worried we might break up.

541
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:00,670
Why would I break up with you?

542
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,245
Just standing next to you...

543
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:04,815
makes my heart flutter.

544
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:06,915
Really?

545
00:29:07,555 --> 00:29:10,480
If that's how you felt, you should've just told me.

546
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,625
You had me worried to death.

547
00:29:16,895 --> 00:29:18,495
Then you're not...

548
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:22,465
regretting that you agreed to start dating me, right?

549
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:25,535
- No. - Then that means...

550
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:28,005
- today's our first date, right? - Yes.

551
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:34,075
Then since we're officially a couple now,

552
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:38,555
can I hold your hand?

553
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:01,335
Yoon Ah. Then how about...

554
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:03,905
we go on a proper date again tomorrow?

555
00:30:04,645 --> 00:30:05,700
All right.

556
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,345
Is that all you can say though?

557
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:11,540
Yes.

558
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,015
Never mind. All right.

559
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,755
Let's just go. Let's go.

560
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:29,360
Listen up. You know we're expecting a lot of guests today, right?

561
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,430
Every nook and cranny of this house needs to be clean. Do you get it?

562
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,530
- Yes, sir. - All right.

563
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,635
Good.

564
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:37,440
Yoon Ah. Give it to me.

565
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:38,600
I'll take care of it.

566
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,145
You don't have to.

567
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:42,010
Thank you, Dong Gu.

568
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,745
You don't have to thank me.

569
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:46,340
You go on in with Sol and get some rest.

570
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,685
I'm all right.

571
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:54,280
That's enough, Seo Jin. You should go and get some rest too.

572
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,695
You worked overtime last night. You shouldn't have to do this.

573
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,020
Thank you.

574
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,565
I can always rely on you.

575
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:02,965
I think that's enough.

576
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:05,460
How could a single like me bear to live here?

577
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,430
If you're jealous, you should start dating someone.

578
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,575
You're just upset because you're jealous.

579
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,400
Wait and see.

580
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,270
I'll make sure I meet a girl...

581
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,615
much better than Yoon Ah or Seo Jin.

582
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,285
Is that right?

583
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:23,010
But you see, Yoon Ah is...

584
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,180
pretty, nice, and genuine. She's like morning dew.

585
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,725
I wonder if a girl like her even exists.

586
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:30,120
I agree.

587
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,690
My Bacca is so cute and adorable.

588
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,990
Her beard is cooler than Park Chan Ho.

589
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,465
No such girl can possible exist.

590
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,105
That's enough.

591
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,875
What did you just do, you jerk?

592
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:46,575
Stop it. You guys are acting childish.

593
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:48,345
By the way, where's Soo Ah?

594
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:51,040
I don't know. I think she's in her room.

595
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
What?

596
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,815
What is she doing in her room when we're all out here cleaning?

597
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:05,595
What are you doing?

598
00:32:07,565 --> 00:32:09,765
I wasn't doing anything.

599
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:12,905
You couldn't have been doing a cucumber pack, right?

600
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,430
I wasn't.

601
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,470
I sliced them up so we can make side dished with them.

602
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:19,000
Why were you putting them on your face then?

603
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,345
You mean these?

604
00:32:21,515 --> 00:32:23,740
I was just salting them.

605
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,040
You see, my face is quite salty.

606
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,110
Are you kidding me?

607
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,610
Stop now and just come down to lend a hand for the cleanup.

608
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,010
I'm shooting today for my online shopping mall.

609
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,980
I need my skin care before the shooting.

610
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,825
That's your problem.

611
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:35,025
You're living in my house but never listen to me.

612
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:37,520
Living in your house?

613
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,720
I'm here as a guest.

614
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,695
Gosh, a guest?

615
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:43,635
What's wrong? Stop fighting.

616
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:46,060
Why do you always fight?

617
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,130
She's mean all the time.

618
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,705
What? Mean?

619
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:51,430
How dare you say that to your sister?

620
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,100
Kang Seo Jin, is that all you have to say?

621
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,400
Yes.

622
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,570
You need to act like an older person for me to treat you like one.

623
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,650
- How dare you? - Stop.

624
00:32:59,655 --> 00:33:01,385
- What? - What?

625
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:06,355
Gosh, I thought I was going to die.

626
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:09,425
I don't even have the strength to stand up.

627
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:10,925
Well done guys.

628
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,845
Welcome.

629
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:35,485
Who are you?

630
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,855
I reserved a room today.

631
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,655
What?

632
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:42,595
What language is that?

633
00:33:42,665 --> 00:33:43,895
Maybe she reserved a room.

634
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:56,700
- Are you Angela? - Yes, I'm Angela.

635
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,275
- Angela. - But...

636
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:01,470
what language was she speaking in?

637
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,915
She's from Ukraine.

638
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:05,215
Can't she speak English?

639
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:06,815
Can you speak English?

640
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:09,755
No, I can only speak Ukrainian.

641
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,080
What's she saying?

642
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,780
- I don't think she speaks English. - What?

643
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,025
That's a shame.

644
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:16,825
I'll show you to your room.

645
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:18,295
Follow me.

646
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:21,765
Wait.

647
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:34,045
She's so pretty.

648
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:36,445
I thought she was a doll.

649
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,015
Right, Du Shik?

650
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:39,715
What's this?

651
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:42,855
What's this sound?

652
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,555
Is this the sound of your heart beating again?

653
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,555
Jun Ki, I think...

654
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:50,720
I'm in love.

655
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,465
What? Again?

656
00:34:52,935 --> 00:34:55,120
You fall in love with everyone.

657
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,965
It's real this time.

658
00:34:57,535 --> 00:35:00,460
I've never felt such a strong pull.

659
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,840
Wake up, Du Shik.

660
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:04,975
She's out of your league.

661
00:35:05,445 --> 00:35:08,710
Don't do something rash.

662
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,070
You'll only get hurt.

663
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,785
Hey, wake up. Hey.

664
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:15,310
He's out of his mind. Hey!

665
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,410
Angela.

666
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:22,895
(Can Love be Translated?)

667
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:38,675
Angela, do you want to drink this?

668
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:40,375
Drinking?

669
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:41,875
Thank you.

670
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:45,515
What is she saying?

671
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:49,755
Do you like the room? Do you need anything?

672
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:51,980
I'm sorry, but I don't speak English. I don't understand.

673
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,655
Gosh, I can't understand anything.

674
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:56,025
Let's use the translator.

675
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:01,495
Angela, I fell in love at first sight.

676
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:05,675
Angela, would you like to split the first snow in half?

677
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:08,830
What? What did you say?

678
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,175
What?

679
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,800
What's this? I don't think she got it.

680
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,075
There must have been a mistake.

681
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:16,740
(Korean to Ukrainian Translator)

682
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,915
Angela, do you happen to have...

683
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:21,185
a boyfriend?

684
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:24,585
Angela, does your friend have your ovum?

685
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:28,425
What? What do you mean?

686
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:32,095
I'm sorry, but I need to go out now.

687
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:34,465
- Angela. Angela? - Bye.

688
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:36,065
Angela.

689
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:39,100
Gosh, what's this?

690
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:40,605
The translator isn't working.

691
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:42,205
What should I do?

692
00:36:45,615 --> 00:36:47,670
Clean them properly.

693
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,670
I will. I'm doing my best.

694
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,645
Why are you shouting at me?

695
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:55,385
It's my senior.

696
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:57,780
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,280
"Yes, ma'am."

698
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,550
It's me. How's your vacation?

699
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,750
Yes.

700
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,995
I'm resting well.

701
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:07,495
Really? That's good.

702
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:11,590
In that case, I'll send you some documents through your email.

703
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,730
Can you send me a summary of that by tomorrow at 8am?

704
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,130
It's my graduate school assignment.

705
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,740
- Do you understand? - Me?

706
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:20,670
Why? You don't want to do it?

707
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,615
No, I will.

708
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:25,245
All right.

709
00:37:26,155 --> 00:37:27,685
Gosh.

710
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:29,220
What's wrong?

711
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:32,420
She's making me do her graduate school assignment.

712
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:35,280
What? Why is she doing that?

713
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,420
I don't know.

714
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,660
But I can't say no to my superior.

715
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:41,690
Gosh, she never lost against me.

716
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,360
Now she can't say anything to her superior.

717
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,460
Shut it.

718
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,405
Go finish the dishes.

719
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:49,605
Gosh, it's my precious day off.

720
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:56,315
Serves you right. Gosh.

721
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,895
- What are you doing? - I'm learning Ukrainian. Why?

722
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:12,200
I don't understand a thing.

723
00:38:12,205 --> 00:38:15,290
- That won't solve anything. - Then what should I do?

724
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,790
This is the least I can do to talk to Angela.

725
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,160
Don't worry.

726
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,705
We found a way for you two to communicate.

727
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:24,775
Really? How?

728
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:27,970
- Come on. Come on. - Come on. Come on.

729
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,270
- Yes! - Yes, come on.

730
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,215
Who are these people?

731
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:33,810
Aren't they our guests?

732
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,215
Listen to me first.

733
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:38,955
The problem here is that you can't communicate with Angela.

734
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:42,750
Why? The only language Angela speaks is Ukrainian.

735
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,120
- Right. - That's true.

736
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,330
It's going to get complicated.

737
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:48,790
So concentrate and listen well.

738
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,935
All right.

739
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:53,505
First, Mark from Germany can speak Ukrainian.

740
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:56,400
Bruno from France can speak German.

741
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,230
Hanako from Japan can...

742
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,445
speak French, as well as Korean.

743
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:02,545
- Do you understand? - No, not at all.

744
00:39:02,785 --> 00:39:05,140
So what does this have to do with Angela?

745
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,785
Gosh.

746
00:39:06,855 --> 00:39:09,910
So if Angela talks to Mark...

747
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,280
in Ukrainian,

748
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,880
Mark will translate it to Bruno in German.

749
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,750
Bruno will translate it to Hanako in French.

750
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,190
Then Hanako will translate it into Korean for you.

751
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,635
Do you understand?

752
00:39:22,805 --> 00:39:25,830
So you want me to talk to her through three translators?

753
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,360
That's right.

754
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,075
You'll understand her.

755
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:31,775
Why? You don't like it?

756
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,175
- Okay. - No.

757
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:36,070
Thanks, Jun Ki.

758
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,680
What are you doing? Go and ask her out.

759
00:39:38,685 --> 00:39:40,785
Hey, follow me. Follow me!

760
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,880
- Follow me! - Go! Go!

761
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,225
- Go! Go! - Go! Go!

762
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:49,395
Jerk. He's so happy.

763
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:52,990
But will Angela accept him...

764
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,890
even if they understand each other?

765
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,735
No, of course not.

766
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:59,330
We're just helping him out.

767
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,035
He can at least try.

768
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:04,705
He's obviously going to be rejected miserably.

769
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:08,100
Shall we follow him and comfort him when that happens?

770
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,345
Shall we?

771
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:13,210
He's probably going to cry again. Shall we take some tissues?

772
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,155
- Should I get two boxes? - Shall we go now?

773
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:24,995
What are you doing? Ask her out.

774
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:26,795
All right.

775
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:30,135
I...

776
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:32,735
I fell in love at first sight.

777
00:40:33,905 --> 00:40:35,700
Really? Since when?

778
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,275
What do you like about me?

779
00:40:37,345 --> 00:40:38,805
Hey, Hanako.

780
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:40,640
He didn't mean you.

781
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:43,340
You need to deliver this to Angela.

782
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,770
Gosh, all right.

783
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:54,350
Angela, I fell in love at first sight.

784
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,350
(Ukrainian)

785
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,525
Really?

786
00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:01,865
Hey, no, Angela.

787
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:04,860
Not him. Him.

788
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,005
He likes you.

789
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,945
Ask her what she thinks of me.

790
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:15,140
All right.

791
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:16,645
What do you think of me?

792
00:41:16,885 --> 00:41:20,985
What do you think of me?

793
00:41:21,185 --> 00:41:24,455
I like him. He looked nice when I first saw him yesterday.

794
00:41:25,325 --> 00:41:30,895
I like him. He looked nice when I first saw him yesterday.

795
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:34,330
It's good news. She likes you.

796
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:36,565
Really? Really?

797
00:41:39,305 --> 00:41:41,530
Can you ask her if she wants to go out with me?

798
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,375
- All right. - Go on.

799
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,075
Sure.

800
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:46,475
She wants to.

801
00:41:46,845 --> 00:41:49,570
- What? - Really?

802
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,915
Are you sure, Angela?

803
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,285
- Yes. - Thank you. Thank you.

804
00:41:54,655 --> 00:41:57,310
Jun Ki, Dong Gu, thank you so much.

805
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,780
It's all thanks to you.

806
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,225
Thank you so much.

807
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:02,525
It's great.

808
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,795
I did nothing.

809
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:14,605
Gosh.

810
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:17,575
Why do I have to work overnight on my day off?

811
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:19,975
Gosh, if she wasn't my superior, I would...

812
00:42:21,845 --> 00:42:24,015
No, I need to suppress this anger.

813
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,685
I might get in trouble at work.

814
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:29,355
Gosh, I'm hungry.

815
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:32,725
I should probably eat something.

816
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:36,795
Can I use your hairdryer?

817
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:41,065
My phone.

818
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:43,830
Gosh. What are you doing?

819
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:44,960
I'm sorry.

820
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,330
I didn't bump into you on purpose.

821
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,960
You're so careless.

822
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,500
I said, I'm sorry.

823
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,305
Just take it out.

824
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:03,610
I can't see anything. Shine some light.

825
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,410
I am doing it right now.

826
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,650
Move it a bit to this side.

827
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,425
- Fine. - There it is.

828
00:43:18,635 --> 00:43:20,905
I got it.

829
00:43:21,405 --> 00:43:22,705
I got it.

830
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:26,575
Wait. What is this?

831
00:43:26,915 --> 00:43:29,315
What is this? What's going on?

832
00:43:29,385 --> 00:43:31,970
Gosh.

833
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,610
Your brush is tangled in my hair.

834
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:34,640
What are you going to do now?

835
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,655
It's because you kept rubbing your head against mine.

836
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,325
Gosh. Stay still.

837
00:43:44,575 --> 00:43:46,535
It's not working.

838
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:49,360
- It hurts. - It hurts.

839
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,435
It hurts.

840
00:43:53,145 --> 00:43:54,835
I don't think I can do it.

841
00:43:54,845 --> 00:43:56,370
I can't seem to untangle your hair.

842
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,670
Really?

843
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,615
It's driving me crazy. What should we do?

844
00:44:01,545 --> 00:44:03,885
Could a hairdresser help?

845
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,185
- A hairdresser? - A hairdresser?

846
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:07,715
Cheers.

847
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:13,995
Here.

848
00:44:21,165 --> 00:44:22,435
By the way,

849
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:26,475
Angela seems to have surprisingly low standards for men.

850
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:29,345
- Right? - Yes.

851
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:32,470
They look so weird together.

852
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,240
Exactly.

853
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,385
It's like, "Beauty and the Beast".

854
00:44:37,555 --> 00:44:41,215
Or more like, "Beauty and the Dwarf".

855
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:43,825
Why? I think they look adorable together.

856
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:46,320
Are you jealous that...

857
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,695
Du Shik has a beautiful girlfriend?

858
00:44:49,235 --> 00:44:50,390
No way.

859
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,890
I have a beautiful girlfriend like you.

860
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,635
Why would I be jealous?

861
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:58,605
I am. I am very jealous.

862
00:44:58,775 --> 00:45:01,040
I'm so upset.

863
00:45:01,045 --> 00:45:04,705
How could Du Shik date a girl like Angela?

864
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:08,215
No way. I'm not jealous either.

865
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:12,645
I have a cute girlfriend like Seo Jin.

866
00:45:12,855 --> 00:45:13,955
It hurts.

867
00:45:14,225 --> 00:45:16,155
I'm so jealous that it hurts.

868
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:20,055
It feels like I have a huge weight on my chest.

869
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:22,655
I can't contain my anger.

870
00:45:27,265 --> 00:45:28,720
It's not going to work.

871
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,405
It's tangled so badly I can't do anything about it.

872
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:33,200
I'll have to cut your hair off.

873
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:35,500
What? You're going to cut our hair off?

874
00:45:35,505 --> 00:45:38,070
No. It'd ruin my style.

875
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,900
Are you going to stay like this forever?

876
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,840
I'll have to cut off at least one person's hair...

877
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,945
to get the brush out.

878
00:45:45,255 --> 00:45:47,080
We have no choice. Your hair will have to be cut off.

879
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,580
What? Hey.

880
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,910
I'm a model for my shopping mall.

881
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,980
I can't have my hair cut off.

882
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,120
Are you saying my hair should be cut off?

883
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,990
Then this will be all that's left of my bangs.

884
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,320
How will I go to work?

885
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,420
Whatever. I'll never have my hair cut off.

886
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,830
I'd rather die that have my hair cut off.

887
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,330
You're responsible for this. Your hair should be cut off.

888
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,700
Why am I responsible? Your hair should be cut off.

889
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,605
Gosh, I can't believe you.

890
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,045
What is it now?

891
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:12,575
It's work.

892
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:15,300
Hello.

893
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,885
I received your summary.

894
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:19,780
By the way, can you come to my place right now?

895
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,755
Sorry? Right now?

896
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:24,685
I'm in the middle of something right now.

897
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:27,595
No matter what you're doing, come here within 30 minutes.

898
00:46:28,025 --> 00:46:29,725
Hello? Hello?

899
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:32,990
Gosh, she's driving me crazy.

900
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,360
- What is it? - I don't know.

901
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,065
She wants me to come to her place right now.

902
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:37,930
Tell the hairdresser to cut off your hair now.

903
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,100
Why? You're the one in a hurry.

904
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,500
I have no reason to hurry.

905
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,945
All right.

906
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:45,745
Are you sure?

907
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:48,375
Hey!

908
00:46:48,585 --> 00:46:50,645
It hurts. Hold on!

909
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:59,010
Where are our board games?

910
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,680
Angela wants to play. Do you want to join?

911
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,980
I'm fine.

912
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,225
- I'm fine too. - All right.

913
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:09,465
Du Shik.

914
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:12,205
- Will you be all right? - What?

915
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:16,945
- What are you talking about? - I'm talking about Angela.

916
00:47:17,475 --> 00:47:19,330
Do you really know her well?

917
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,900
- What is this all about? - I mean,

918
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,670
Angela is so beautiful.

919
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,945
I just can't imagine her not having a boyfriend.

920
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,380
Think about it.

921
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,925
She's so beautiful.

922
00:47:31,055 --> 00:47:33,295
Would guys leave her alone?

923
00:47:33,525 --> 00:47:36,590
He's right. It's impossible.

924
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,390
Are you saying she might be two-timing me?

925
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,160
Well, that's not exactly what I mean.

926
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,405
But when you're on a trip, it's easy to...

927
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:48,600
cheat on your boyfriend or girlfriend.

928
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,570
That's right.

929
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,480
Doesn't that happen all the time?

930
00:47:53,485 --> 00:47:56,510
Should I ask her if she has a boyfriend?

931
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,685
Well... Maybe.

932
00:48:12,835 --> 00:48:16,135
Well, I was just worried about Du Shik.

933
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:19,675
Same here. I don't want him to get hurt.

934
00:48:27,845 --> 00:48:30,685
Angela, I'm sorry to ask you this,

935
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:33,740
but do you happen to have a boyfriend in Ukraine?

936
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,115
That's what I want to ask her.

937
00:48:35,425 --> 00:48:36,625
Okay.

938
00:48:37,495 --> 00:48:40,295
She doesn't. You're her first boyfriend.

939
00:48:40,365 --> 00:48:42,995
She's both beautiful and innocent.

940
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:45,165
I really hate her.

941
00:48:47,505 --> 00:48:49,800
- Really? I'm your first boyfriend? - Yes.

942
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:52,505
That's such a relief.

943
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:56,245
What?

944
00:48:56,515 --> 00:48:58,530
She doesn't have another boyfriend,

945
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,640
and you're her first boyfriend?

946
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,740
Yes.

947
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,085
I'm her first love.

948
00:49:05,455 --> 00:49:08,040
Really? That's great.

949
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,115
Yes.

950
00:49:09,455 --> 00:49:10,825
That's awesome.

951
00:49:11,055 --> 00:49:13,080
Du Shik, you're so lucky. Congratulations.

952
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,395
Thank you.

953
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:15,955
Du Shik.

954
00:49:16,135 --> 00:49:17,965
Do you have to look at me like that?

955
00:49:18,195 --> 00:49:21,235
It somehow bothers me.

956
00:49:21,365 --> 00:49:24,105
Really? I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

957
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:29,035
Be quiet!

958
00:49:29,775 --> 00:49:31,805
Can you be more careful when you walk?

959
00:49:32,275 --> 00:49:33,815
Your footsteps are so loud.

960
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:36,745
- It gets on my nerves. - Really?

961
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,545
Sorry. I'll be careful.

962
00:49:56,975 --> 00:49:58,605
We're here. Let's get off.

963
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:00,900
Hey. Get off from this side.

964
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,460
You can't open that door from inside.

965
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,605
Come here.

966
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,270
I can't believe you.

967
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,915
Be careful.

968
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:09,845
What are you doing right now?

969
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:12,785
Are you joking with me?

970
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:14,855
No way.

971
00:50:15,685 --> 00:50:18,090
Something happened.

972
00:50:18,095 --> 00:50:20,320
Cut it out. Here's an outfit I bought.

973
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,220
Exchange it for a bigger size at the department store.

974
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,590
- Sorry? - I have an important appointment...

975
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,590
later today.

976
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,930
But I had too much tripe and soju last night,

977
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,105
and the outfit doesn't fit me anymore.

978
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:34,235
I've already called the store, so you can just go and exchange it.

979
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:36,305
Okay.

980
00:50:36,715 --> 00:50:39,715
What are you doing? Hurry up. You don't have much time.

981
00:50:42,785 --> 00:50:44,970
What's wrong with her?

982
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,655
Why would she tell her to exchange her clothes?

983
00:50:46,925 --> 00:50:49,555
Whatever. Come with me.

984
00:50:50,095 --> 00:50:52,455
Hey. Tell me before you move. It hurts.

985
00:50:55,565 --> 00:50:58,590
I'm Angela's first love. It's unbelievable.

986
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,695
Right?

987
00:50:59,835 --> 00:51:00,935
Yes.

988
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:02,865
I'm so happy for you, Du Shik.

989
00:51:03,275 --> 00:51:04,605
By the way,

990
00:51:05,935 --> 00:51:07,575
will you be all right?

991
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:10,845
- What is it now? - You're an international couple.

992
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:14,440
It won't be easy to maintain the relationship.

993
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,270
He's right.

994
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:17,670
She'll get tired.

995
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:21,480
If someone comforts her, she might leave you for him.

996
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,755
That's the way it is.

997
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,985
Isn't that what always happens?

998
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,225
You think so?

999
00:51:26,925 --> 00:51:28,455
I probably should ask her.

1000
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:33,560
I can't believe that Angela is an exchange student.

1001
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,320
If she decides to stay in Korea,

1002
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,630
we might even get married.

1003
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,805
Right.

1004
00:51:39,235 --> 00:51:42,175
- That sounds great. - I know.

1005
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:44,345
It's unbelievable.

1006
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:47,015
Du Shik.

1007
00:51:47,385 --> 00:51:48,940
Would your parents be okay?

1008
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,710
- My parents? - Yes.

1009
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,550
You'll be an international couple.

1010
00:51:52,555 --> 00:51:56,550
Due to Confucianism, Koreans are biased against international dating.

1011
00:51:56,555 --> 00:51:58,585
What about your parents?

1012
00:51:58,695 --> 00:52:01,420
Will they allow you dating Angela?

1013
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,820
He's right.

1014
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,250
Everyone I know is against it.

1015
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,020
That's what most people think.

1016
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,035
You're right. I haven't thought about it.

1017
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,960
I've never seen my parents so happy.

1018
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,005
I had no idea that they would already call her a daughter-in-law.

1019
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:21,115
Right. That sounds nice.

1020
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:24,170
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, Du Shik.

1021
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,385
Thank you.

1022
00:52:26,085 --> 00:52:29,580
Can you do something about your gum when you laugh?

1023
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,250
It's very disagreeable.

1024
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,620
Really?

1025
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:33,895
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

1026
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:37,050
By the way, Du Shik.

1027
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,990
Do something about your nostrils when you laugh.

1028
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,220
Your nostrils almost smirk at me. It's annoying.

1029
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,605
Really? I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

1030
00:52:45,935 --> 00:52:48,360
I was supposed to drink beer with Angela.

1031
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,605
I'm going upstairs.

1032
00:52:52,775 --> 00:52:54,375
What are those fingers?

1033
00:52:56,485 --> 00:52:58,785
- My stomach hurts. - My stomach hurts.

1034
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:05,410
Here you go.

1035
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,460
Why did you come so late?

1036
00:53:07,465 --> 00:53:10,225
You couldn't handle a simple task like this.

1037
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:12,165
I'm sorry.

1038
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:15,235
Forget it. Leave now.

1039
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:17,365
Goodness.

1040
00:53:20,005 --> 00:53:22,035
Who does she think she is?

1041
00:53:22,105 --> 00:53:25,245
You did a chore for her, but she didn't even thank you.

1042
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:27,675
It's okay. Let's go.

1043
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:31,010
You always talk back to me,

1044
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,910
but why are you so careful around her?

1045
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,520
You're not like yourself.

1046
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:37,210
What else can I do? She's a senior at work.

1047
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,925
I punched her thousands of times in my head.

1048
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,320
Really?

1049
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,490
Would you punch her if it were possible?

1050
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:45,665
Yes, so?

1051
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,600
What are you thinking?

1052
00:53:47,605 --> 00:53:50,690
Don't do it. It'll cause trouble at work.

1053
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,165
Don't worry. She'll never find out.

1054
00:53:53,545 --> 00:53:56,335
Where's a convenience store nearby?

1055
00:53:56,415 --> 00:53:57,645
What for?

1056
00:53:59,785 --> 00:54:01,175
There she is.

1057
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:04,585
Honey, I'm leaving now.

1058
00:54:04,915 --> 00:54:08,215
Okay, see you soon.

1059
00:54:10,755 --> 00:54:12,025
What's this?

1060
00:54:13,465 --> 00:54:15,620
What? What's going on?

1061
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,065
What's wrong with this?

1062
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:18,565
That hurts.

1063
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:24,530
Why can't I take my hand off?

1064
00:54:24,535 --> 00:54:27,435
Hey! Who did this?

1065
00:54:30,675 --> 00:54:32,930
Do you think it'll come off easily?

1066
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,115
That's super glue.

1067
00:54:35,885 --> 00:54:38,510
Is it okay to do this?

1068
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,315
Of course. An eye for a tooth.

1069
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,685
You mean an eye for an eye, not an eye for a tooth.

1070
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:46,555
You're so ignorant.

1071
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:48,920
Does it matter now?

1072
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,525
What matters now is how do we discipline her.

1073
00:54:51,095 --> 00:54:52,350
Let's go.

1074
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,220
I'll get in trouble if I get caught.

1075
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,190
You won't get caught.

1076
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,605
Lower your head a little. She won't see you.

1077
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:02,200
- Still... - I worked hard to make the glue.

1078
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,745
I bought 20l of water to make it. Step on it.

1079
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,975
I don't know anymore.

1080
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:10,115
Let's go.

1081
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:12,085
Let's go.

1082
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,735
Lower your head a little. She won't see you.

1083
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:19,350
- Still... - I worked hard to make the glue.

1084
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,895
I bought 20l of water to make it. Step on it.

1085
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:24,125
I don't know anymore.

1086
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:27,265
Let's go.

1087
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,235
Let's go.

1088
00:55:33,945 --> 00:55:35,175
Lower your head.

1089
00:55:46,215 --> 00:55:47,740
Hey, who are you?

1090
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,055
Hey, you!

1091
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:55,995
That serves her right.

1092
00:55:56,025 --> 00:55:59,060
- She should treat people well. - Right.

1093
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,990
It serves her right.

1094
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,320
It feels great.

1095
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,490
Right? Doesn't it feel satisfying?

1096
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,760
Yes, thank you.

1097
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,000
If you're thankful, may I get a milk facial?

1098
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,500
No, never.

1099
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,970
Aren't you grateful that I took a revenge on her?

1100
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,070
I'll pay you back for it.

1101
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,785
I can't live being indebted.

1102
00:56:17,055 --> 00:56:18,415
How will you pay back for it?

1103
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:31,725
Why do you have that look on your face?

1104
00:56:31,965 --> 00:56:33,560
Is something wrong?

1105
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,935
I don't know.

1106
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:38,835
I feel low on energy.

1107
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:40,435
Right.

1108
00:56:40,575 --> 00:56:43,035
I feel depressed and have no appetite.

1109
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,505
I feel like I'm sagging.

1110
00:56:46,175 --> 00:56:47,575
I wonder why.

1111
00:56:48,945 --> 00:56:50,340
- We're home. - We're home.

1112
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,485
Hello.

1113
00:56:51,555 --> 00:56:52,945
Hello.

1114
00:56:53,055 --> 00:56:54,715
Where have you been all day...

1115
00:56:57,495 --> 00:56:59,555
What's wrong with your hair, Seo Jin?

1116
00:57:00,725 --> 00:57:03,425
What? I don't have energy for this.

1117
00:57:09,865 --> 00:57:11,435
Listen.

1118
00:57:12,035 --> 00:57:14,175
Where have you been, darling?

1119
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:16,005
Do you want something to eat?

1120
00:57:17,075 --> 00:57:18,300
Stop it.

1121
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,215
What happened to your hair?

1122
00:57:20,385 --> 00:57:21,600
What happened to your bangs?

1123
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,075
Something happened.

1124
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:26,610
Anyway, I don't owe you anything now.

1125
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,085
I got it.

1126
00:57:29,055 --> 00:57:31,685
You don't ever lose, do you?

1127
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,460
- All right. - What's that?

1128
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:36,990
It sounds like Du Shik.

1129
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,425
Why is he so excited?

1130
00:57:38,465 --> 00:57:41,720
Du Shik and Angela decided to go out from today.

1131
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,035
- Things are going well for them. - Really?

1132
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:45,990
I'm happy for Du Shik.

1133
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:48,635
I can't seem to digest well.

1134
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:50,570
Gosh, my stomach.

1135
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,745
My stomach hurts all of a sudden.

1136
00:57:53,385 --> 00:57:55,245
My stomach.

1137
00:57:56,345 --> 00:57:57,615
What's wrong with them?

1138
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:03,040
Cheers. Let's drink.

1139
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,425
Bottoms up.

1140
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:08,595
I'm tired.

1141
00:58:08,995 --> 00:58:11,090
Let's stop drinking and go to sleep.

1142
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:14,465
Let's drink a little more. Isn't it fun?

1143
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:17,290
Darn it. You lied.

1144
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:18,765
"Darn it'? "You lied"?

1145
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:22,140
Where did you learn Korean, Hanako?

1146
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,770
You only learned bad words.

1147
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,045
I have to pee.

1148
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:27,375
I'm going to the restroom.

1149
00:58:28,345 --> 00:58:29,645
Tell it to Angela.

1150
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:31,545
Pee or poop?

1151
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:32,910
Do I have to say it?

1152
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,740
Then she'll know how long she has to wait.

1153
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,580
Gosh, fine.

1154
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,280
I'm going to pee, okay?

1155
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,495
Okay.

1156
00:58:41,165 --> 00:58:44,150
He's going to poop.

1157
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:46,250
(French to German)

1158
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,690
(German to Ukrainian)

1159
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,160
(Ukrainian)

1160
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,905
Does he have to say that?

1161
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:54,205
It's so hard to pee.

1162
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:56,600
Angela, wait a little.

1163
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,045
I'll be back.

1164
00:58:58,645 --> 00:59:00,445
Have fun and drink.

1165
00:59:03,955 --> 00:59:05,285
What's wrong, Angela?

1166
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:09,040
Du Shik and I can't communicate.

1167
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,855
It's uncomfortable.

1168
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:15,155
Isn't it hard for you to translate?

1169
00:59:15,195 --> 00:59:17,695
No, I was happy to be with you.

1170
00:59:17,865 --> 00:59:20,365
As I talk to you, I find that you're a good person.

1171
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:22,165
Really?

1172
00:59:23,265 --> 00:59:26,005
Actually, I like you too.

1173
00:59:26,405 --> 00:59:27,635
Really?

1174
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:40,080
What if I end up marrying Angela?

1175
00:59:40,085 --> 00:59:43,310
Wait, we'll have an Ukrainian wedding...

1176
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,780
and a Korean traditional wedding.

1177
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,255
Do we have to get married twice?

1178
00:59:46,325 --> 00:59:47,750
What about the guests?

1179
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,350
Do we have to rent a plane?

1180
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,620
I don't know. What do I do?

1181
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,165
My Angela.

1182
01:00:02,005 --> 01:00:03,235
Goodness.

1183
01:00:04,075 --> 01:00:05,645
What's wrong?

1184
01:00:05,975 --> 01:00:08,645
I might have insomnia.

1185
01:00:09,045 --> 01:00:10,650
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

1186
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:13,715
I must be stressed out about shoots.

1187
01:00:14,255 --> 01:00:16,555
I have serious insomnia.

1188
01:00:16,925 --> 01:00:18,225
Is that so?

1189
01:00:18,755 --> 01:00:20,185
That sounds terrible.

1190
01:00:22,225 --> 01:00:24,225
That's strange. Where did she go?

1191
01:00:24,795 --> 01:00:26,150
What's wrong?

1192
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,320
Are you looking for someone?

1193
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,590
When I woke up in the morning, Angela was gone.

1194
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,865
Her luggage is gone too.

1195
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:35,230
Hanako, have you seen Angela?

1196
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:36,435
Angela?

1197
01:00:36,505 --> 01:00:39,330
She left with her suitcase early in the morning.

1198
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:40,440
What?

1199
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,740
What do you mean that she left?

1200
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,380
Angela and Marco were together...

1201
01:00:46,385 --> 01:00:48,485
until early morning.

1202
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:52,020
- It felt strange between the two. - What?

1203
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:54,755
Both of them disappeared in the morning.

1204
01:00:56,595 --> 01:00:58,630
What are you talking about?

1205
01:00:58,635 --> 01:00:59,925
Hey. Wait.

1206
01:00:59,995 --> 01:01:02,995
Then does this mean Angela and Marco...

1207
01:01:03,365 --> 01:01:05,335
had a secret affair and ran away?

1208
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:07,330
- What? - Oh, dear.

1209
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,075
They fell in love. They did, indeed.

1210
01:01:10,215 --> 01:01:11,900
They speak the same language and he's good-looking.

1211
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,045
Anyone would fall in love in that situation.

1212
01:01:16,215 --> 01:01:18,545
This can't be true. This can't be true.

1213
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:22,555
Angela. Angela.

1214
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:24,485
Oh, dear.

1215
01:01:24,795 --> 01:01:27,325
I feel so bad for Du Shik.

1216
01:01:27,525 --> 01:01:31,260
I was hoping this relationship would work out this time.

1217
01:01:31,265 --> 01:01:32,595
Me too.

1218
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:36,820
I prayed all night for him, so he could finally start dating...

1219
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,735
for the first time in his life.

1220
01:01:39,705 --> 01:01:42,635
I feel so bad for Du Shik.

1221
01:01:46,645 --> 01:01:47,775
What's going on?

1222
01:01:48,085 --> 01:01:50,545
How could they fall asleep so quickly when they have insomnia?

1223
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:55,785
They're even smiling in their sleep.

1224
01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:00,825
They must be dreaming a happy dream.

1225
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:27,020
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1226
01:02:27,025 --> 01:02:28,580
A fan? Do I have a fan now?

1227
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,280
He can't stop smiling around her.

1228
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,850
I can't even remember when we last went on a date.

1229
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,010
Do you want to go see a movie?

1230
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,320
Really? You promised.

1231
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,820
I wonder why I haven't heard from Jun Ki.

1232
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,750
- Jun Ki. - What are you doing here?

1233
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,360
I switched them all with photos of me.

1234
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,890
Why can't you stop teasing Du Shik?

1235
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:45,560
Nothing's more fun than teasing Du Shik.

1236
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,330
Du Shik. Have you fallen for Ah Young?

1237
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,000
If you like her, why don't you ask her out on a date?

1238
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,500
I'm planning on asking Ah Young to go out with me.

1239
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,830
How could you do this to me?

1240
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,740
You two seem be like newlyweds.

1241
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,410
Dong Gu. How far have you gone?

1242
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,610
I assume you two have kissed, right?

1243
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:00,440
Affection isn't the yardstick for love.

1244
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,720
Erase that dirty idea from your head.

1245
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:05,180
I want to kiss her. I want to kiss her. I want to kiss her.

1246
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,320
Dong Gu. Dong Gu. Can't you hear me?

1247
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,390
Actually, I have something I want to say to you.

1248
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,550
- Excuse me? - Yoon Ah.

1249
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,695
I'm asking you if I can kiss you now.
