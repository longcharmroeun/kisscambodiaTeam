1
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:13,169
- Okay. - I'll hit the slate. 1, 2.

2
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:14,977
("Welcome to Waikiki" shows us...)

3
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:17,218
(the story about how the three youths grow up.)

4
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:20,648
(There are 6 main characters in "Welcome to Waikiki".)

5
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:23,718
(Dong Gu, a director wannabe, who has become cynical)

6
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:26,118
I'm an actor.

7
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:30,387
(Light-hearted actor for survival, Jun Ki)

8
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:32,897
- Dong Gu. - Why?

9
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:36,028
(Du Shik, who dreams about pure love but has never dated anyone)

10
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:37,598
Come here. I'll feed you.

11
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,338
Hey.

12
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,908
(Clumsy single mom, Yoon Ah)

13
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:46,738
This is not the place to act up.

14
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:48,607
How dare you?

15
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,948
(Seo Jin, who is wild but cool)

16
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:53,617
Love? That won't last forever.

17
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:55,048
You sound like a snob.

18
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:58,257
(Soo Ah, a model who is always straightforward)

19
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,857
(The actors will tell us about the episodes...)

20
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:05,098
(and the behind stories.)

21
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,397
(We'll also show you the bloopers and edited scenes.)

22
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:10,367
- No. - Seriously.

23
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:13,098
- Hey! - Cut. Cut.

24
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:16,138
A surprising story. A shocking story.

25
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:21,348
(Welcome to Waikiki Special starts now!)

26
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:23,277
1, 2,3.

27
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:25,218
(The shooting for Welcome to Waikiki Special begins.)

28
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,018
We'll begin shooting. Let's begin with Yi Kyung.

29
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:31,087
Yes.

30
00:01:31,557 --> 00:01:33,858
Start!

31
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,628
Hello.

32
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,397
Welcome to...

33
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,197
- Waikiki! - Waikiki!

34
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:45,067
I'm... Shall we introduce ourselves?

35
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:50,938
I'm Kim Jung Hyun, acting as Dong Gu, the CEO of the guesthouse.

36
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,248
To explain more about my character,

37
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:58,277
constant misfortune has led him to become cynical,

38
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:01,947
and he gets angry all the time.

39
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,417
He wasn't written to be like that on the script,

40
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:06,117
but he gets angry so often that he even got a nickname for it.

41
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:07,458
However, he is actually soft-hearted.

42
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:10,828
That's why he is often manipulated.

43
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:14,798
He might be short-tempered, but he is actually a nice guy.

44
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:17,768
That's my character, Kang Dong Gu,

45
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:20,138
and my name is Kim Jung Hyun.

46
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:24,008
Dong Gu and... Well...

47
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:25,277
- What was your name? - Du Shik.

48
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:26,277
Du Shik.

49
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:27,608
Along with Dong Gu and Du Shik,

50
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:31,078
Jun Ki runs Waikiki Guesthouse.

51
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:34,147
He wants to become a famous actor, but he is still unknown.

52
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:36,018
My name is Lee Yi Kyung.

53
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,788
Jun Ki has high hopes...

54
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:40,018
and clear goals.

55
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:42,328
He is very innocent and passionate...

56
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:45,328
in that sense. But he often gets in trouble.

57
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:46,427
He is a troublemaker.

58
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:49,127
He is an important member...

59
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,038
of this guesthouse.

60
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,467
Hello.

61
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:56,638
I play Du Shik, the poor scenario writer. My name is Son Seung Won.

62
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,078
Du Shik is...

63
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:00,548
Jung Hyun... I mean, Dong Gu...

64
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,807
- What's your name? - Jun Ki.

65
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,818
Du Shik is a good friend of Dong Gu and Jun Ki's.

66
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,647
He is the most soft-hearted one here,

67
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:11,358
but he can sometimes be clever too.

68
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,557
He can both be oblivious and clever.

69
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:16,988
He's never had a girlfriend in his life.

70
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,228
But he falls in love very easily.

71
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:21,798
He also loves food.

72
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:24,638
He is eating something in many scenes.

73
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,307
But he doesn't seem to gain any weight.

74
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:29,638
All right. That's all.

75
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:31,608
(They're so awkward.)

76
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:33,138
I play...

77
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:34,647
a single mom...

78
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,518
in Welcome to Waikiki. Her name is Han Yoon Ah,

79
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,548
and my name is Jung In Sun.

80
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,918
Yoon Ah purses her dream.

81
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:44,818
She always works hard for her dreams,

82
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,657
but she makes mistakes all the time.

83
00:03:47,657 --> 00:03:50,187
She can sometimes be slow and oblivious,

84
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:54,068
but she always tries to...

85
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,228
stay positive.

86
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:56,427
Yoon Ah, is dinner ready yet?

87
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:57,937
I'll prepare it now.

88
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,597
Hurry up.

89
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:02,568
Hello. My character, Seo Jin,

90
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:06,337
has the most power in this house and is Dong Gu's little sister.

91
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:09,108
My name is Go Won Hee.

92
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:10,647
The most peculiar thing...

93
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:13,777
about Seo Jin is that she has a mustache.

94
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:15,087
The reason why she does is...

95
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:18,558
because she started shaving to copy her dad and brother.

96
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,027
She ended up having coarser hair,

97
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:23,928
and now, she turns into...

98
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:26,797
Chewbacca in a few hours.

99
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:28,667
I think I see your mustache even now.

100
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,868
Even without makeup.

101
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:32,037
- Did you shave today? - Yes.

102
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:33,938
I think her mustache is thicker than mine.

103
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:35,537
It's part of the acting.

104
00:04:35,537 --> 00:04:36,667
- It is? - Yes.

105
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,237
- It's acting. - Your mustache?

106
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,547
I'll have it permanently removed when our shooting is over.

107
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,607
(Permanent hair removal)

108
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:45,717
I play Soo Ah, and my name is Lee Ju Woo.

109
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:48,717
Soo Ah is pretentious...

110
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:51,487
and immature but in a cute way.

111
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,717
I'd like to say...

112
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:56,328
she is supposed to be the prettiest girl in this house.

113
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,628
- What? - Sorry?

114
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,727
Let's give her a big hand.

115
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,297
(Applause)

116
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,868
When it's awkward, we should applaud.

117
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:05,138
If you're a fan of this show,

118
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,667
you may have already known who we are.

119
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,008
But we wanted to introduce ourselves...

120
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:12,277
once again.

121
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:15,178
We'd like to thank all viewers...

122
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,047
of Welcome to Waikiki. Let's say thank you.

123
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,977
- Thank you. - Thank you.

124
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:20,147
Let's bow.

125
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,487
(Thank you for watching the last 10 episodes.)

126
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,487
Be polite.

127
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:23,787
Thank you.

128
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:25,558
(It looks as if the show is over.)

129
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,758
We have...

130
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,428
five more weeks to go. We'll prepare fun, touching,

131
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:32,597
humanistic, romantic, and comic episodes.

132
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,768
We'll work hard.

133
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:38,998
Today, we'd like to review the last 10 episodes.

134
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:43,167
For today's special,

135
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:46,308
we've picked our favorite scenes so far.

136
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:48,277
We'll also find out which episode...

137
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:50,407
our viewers liked the most.

138
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,647
You'll get to watch our bloopers as well.

139
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:53,948
Please look forward to it.

140
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:55,018
Applause, please.

141
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:56,287
(Applauding)

142
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:57,318
Like a seal.

143
00:05:57,717 --> 00:06:00,688
We're about halfway through the show now.

144
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:03,027
Do you realize...

145
00:06:03,027 --> 00:06:04,657
how popular this show is?

146
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:07,628
- Yes. - What makes you realize it?

147
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,797
She's shooting a razor commercial.

148
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:11,198
I wish that was true.

149
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:12,768
I want to do it.

150
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,537
I really do.

151
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,237
My parents...

152
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:18,337
don't watch...

153
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,008
every show I'm in.

154
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:23,147
But they bought a subscription for JTBC to watch this show.

155
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:24,777
This is the first time...

156
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:28,188
they've ever watched VODs.

157
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,657
They watch not only the original airings but also reruns and VODs.

158
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:35,027
- It's... - What about your parents, Yi Kyung?

159
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:37,328
I haven't heard from them in a while.

160
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,227
I'm sure they're well somewhere.

161
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:42,328
We just make sure that the other party is alive.

162
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:44,397
We root for each other.

163
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,397
Although she is not here today,

164
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:48,938
Sol is played by...

165
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:50,808
Yeo Reum.

166
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:53,907
People around me ask about her...

167
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,178
a lot.

168
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:58,448
They think she's so cute and sweet.

169
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:00,917
When I hear that,

170
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:04,657
I'm reminded that our show is popular.

171
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,987
Sol is actually here.

172
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:07,888
I was waiting for you guys to mention her. Sol, come in!

173
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,058
(Is Sol here?)

174
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:10,597
She'll appear in the next episode.

175
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,828
Gosh.

176
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:13,357
You're so funny.

177
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:14,628
When...

178
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:18,397
we started out, we didn't expect this enthusiastic response.

179
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:21,008
At first, we weren't even sure how we should shoot this show.

180
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,808
"What should we do?"

181
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,277
We were a bit unsure.

182
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,808
Why do you think...

183
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:29,708
this show became so popular?

184
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,878
I think it's our energy.

185
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:32,748
While shooting,

186
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:35,388
we always try to have fun and stay cheerful.

187
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,217
We try many new things as well.

188
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:42,087
I think this show has become popular thanks to that kind of energy.

189
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,797
I'd guess it's because...

190
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:47,227
- our characters are so extreme. - Right.

191
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:50,797
- You have a point. - People like our characters...

192
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,498
might exist in the real world too,

193
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:55,568
but six of these people don't often happen to be at the same place.

194
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:58,008
I think the combination of the characters is...

195
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,907
what made this show popular.

196
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:02,907
I'd like to give...

197
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:04,578
Yi Kyung credit.

198
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:07,318
- Me? - He played an important role.

199
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:08,748
- So suddenly? - Yes.

200
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,558
What makes you think so? Please elaborate.

201
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:12,388
- That's all. - I'd love to hear.

202
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:13,388
No.

203
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:14,458
What did I do?

204
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,587
I'll tell you in person.

205
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:17,828
Really? Our viewers might want to hear.

206
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:20,198
When I review our show,

207
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:23,027
I notice that...

208
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:25,097
Yi Kyung plays a big part in the show.

209
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:27,467
He puts together...

210
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,167
She told me she doesn't watch our show often.

211
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,237
What are you talking about?

212
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:31,308
Did you watch it?

213
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,007
She doesn't follow the story.

214
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:35,377
Really,

215
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:37,717
- Yi Kyung works so hard. - That's right.

216
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,017
- He works really hard. - Seriously.

217
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,548
He is the one...

218
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,948
- who makes the show funny. - Yes.

219
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:44,288
I think I'm done.

220
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:45,418
He is so energetic.

221
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:46,458
Thank you for today.

222
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,587
- Bye. - Bye.

223
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:48,887
- Bye. - Today too.

224
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:52,828
While shooting, many things have happened.

225
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:54,028
In addition to bloopers,

226
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:56,127
do you remember any funny incidents?

227
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,168
(Funny incidents)

228
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:58,237
There are too many.

229
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,837
Something funny happened in every scene.

230
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,068
- Every day... - Every scene was...

231
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:05,007
funny and extreme.

232
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:07,347
- I'm unhappy about one thing. - What is it?

233
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,278
When Jun Ki was on a diet...

234
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,377
I helped him.

235
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,578
I know what it is.

236
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,517
I worked so hard for that scene,

237
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:17,418
but it was cut out.

238
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:21,788
I'm not sure they'll play that scene.

239
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:24,597
Seo Jin was...

240
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,627
sitting on a tire.

241
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:29,798
And I had to drag her.

242
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,168
I became so exhausted, and I couldn't go any farther.

243
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:34,308
So I ran away,

244
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:36,267
which was not in the script.

245
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:37,808
The camera framed out.

246
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:39,837
Won Hee improvised and followed me.

247
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:42,208
But she tripped over the rope and flew.

248
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,048
It was right next to a cliff.

249
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,678
I flew out of the frame.

250
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:46,818
She did.

251
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:49,747
It must have hurt.

252
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:51,617
But she got up right away...

253
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:52,688
and said,

254
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:53,887
"Don't cut it out."

255
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,387
- But it was cut out, right? - Yes.

256
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,458
Can't we watch it?

257
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,997
- I want to watch it. - If you have that part...

258
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,357
Our viewers will be able to watch it.

259
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:01,597
- Okay. - Okay.

260
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:03,497
Did you see that?

261
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,038
She worked so hard.

262
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,208
I loved the police station scene.

263
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:12,408
- You mean the strip show? - Yes.

264
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:13,808
- It was... - It was so cold.

265
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:14,908
the last...

266
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:16,648
That might be true.

267
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,078
It was the last scene.

268
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,247
Everyone was exhausted.

269
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:22,918
The staff was exhausted too.

270
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:25,757
It was supposed to be a very heartwarming scene.

271
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:28,788
But the actors had to take off their clothes.

272
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,097
I remember them running around...

273
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:33,757
to keep themselves warm.

274
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:35,668
It was such a heartwarming scene.

275
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,828
It was.

276
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,837
Many viewers said that...

277
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:41,668
they wished they had friends like them.

278
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:43,607
I felt that way too.

279
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:45,278
I think that scene...

280
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,107
summarizes Welcome to Waikiki very well.

281
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:50,548
Many scenes with Jun Ki were funny.

282
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:52,217
Like the bicycle race track scene...

283
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,548
and the recent clinical test scene.

284
00:10:56,418 --> 00:10:58,257
(Medicine Test)

285
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,717
2,000 dollars in a week?

286
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,227
2,000 dollars?

287
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,357
(Jun Ki and Du Shik participate in a clinical test.)

288
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,497
It's such easy money.

289
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:09,127
I wouldn't mind doing this for the rest of my life.

290
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:10,328
I know.

291
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:12,198
All we do is have our blood taken, take medicine, and lie down.

292
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:13,637
And we get paid 2,000 dollars per week.

293
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:15,308
It's so easy, isn't it?

294
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:17,737
Excuse me.

295
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,637
Take your medicine.

296
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,548
(They're excited to earn 2,000 dollars.)

297
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,278
Do you want me to help?

298
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:26,448
Give me a kiss.

299
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:28,747
Oh, my gosh.

300
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:33,357
(The next morning)

301
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:35,987
Mr. Lee Jun Ki and Mr. Bong Du Shik, please get up.

302
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,257
I need to take your blood.

303
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,627
Again? Okay.

304
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:49,808
(As a side effect, their voices change.)

305
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,708
What happened to my voice?

306
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,708
Gosh, what is this?

307
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,078
What kind of side effect is it?

308
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,877
What if our voices never come back?

309
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:01,847
I know.

310
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,987
Those jerks. How could they give us medicine like that?

311
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,928
(They catch a taxi to go home.)

312
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,398
Mister. Can you take us to Huam-dong?

313
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:16,828
Huam-dong. Waikiki Guesthouse.

314
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,137
What's wrong?

315
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:23,538
I see. It must be because of our voices.

316
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:26,107
Mister. We're not playing games with you.

317
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:29,908
We took part in a clinical test. It's the medicine's side effect.

318
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:34,148
What's the matter, sir?

319
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:37,087
I'm serious. This is a side effect. We're not playing with you.

320
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:40,058
Don't play games with me, you jerks. You're imitating me.

321
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,158
I'll kill you two.

322
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,467
(Du Shik gets a call from his first love, Mal Geum.)

323
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,627
- It's Mal Geum. - What?

324
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:51,298
I can't answer her call with this voice. What should I do?

325
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,538
If you leave a message, I'll pass it onto him.

326
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,308
She said she has to talk to you. She wants to see you.

327
00:12:57,938 --> 00:13:00,208
I wonder what it is. What could it be about?

328
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,808
Maybe she's here to tell you that she likes you.

329
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:06,877
What? Don't be ridiculous. That can't be possible.

330
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:08,948
I know you'd like that.

331
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:10,918
You seem to be looking forward to it.

332
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,717
You're acting coy.

333
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:14,928
- It's so obvious. - Stop it.

334
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,257
I think I'll just follow you and go watch.

335
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,097
Do you really need to go?

336
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,097
(However...)

337
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:24,538
- Can't you just stay? - It's a great opportunity for me.

338
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,408
(Mal Geum tells Du Shik that she's leaving to pursue her dream.)

339
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:32,737
By the way,

340
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:35,377
while packing,

341
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:37,877
I found some pictures I took with you.

342
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,017
Du Shik, thank you for everything.

343
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:47,357
(He says goodbye to her first love.)

344
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,757
(Yoon Mal Geum)

345
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:56,668
(He finds out that he was her first love as well.)

346
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:10,078
Gosh, there's not even one thing I like about you.

347
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:13,517
I'm crazy in love with you

348
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:15,247
- What's that? - What's that sound?

349
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:18,857
I'm waiting for you

350
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:22,727
I have nothing special

351
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:28,097
But I still want you

352
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:31,137
Why does he even want to sing in that voice?

353
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:32,637
You should try to understand him.

354
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,568
Mal Geum is departing today.

355
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,507
The side effect lasts really long.

356
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:39,837
He did take the medicine consistently.

357
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:45,217
To find you, I know that you are the only one

358
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,788
Dong Gu, tell him to stop.

359
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:48,987
(Director Kang Dong Gu)

360
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,418
- So I really want you - Gosh.

361
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:55,428
No one in this family is sane.

362
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,627
- Love me - Love me

363
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:01,727
- Don't make me cry - Don't make me cry

364
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:04,467
- I want to say this - I want to say this

365
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:08,767
- More often than I breathe - More often than I breathe

366
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,038
- Du Shik. - Dong Gu.

367
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:14,548
I'm a coward too.

368
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,347
We shot the bicycle race scene in one shot.

369
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:19,617
It was a full shot.

370
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:21,487
There were many lines.

371
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,318
- I couldn't remember them. - Let's do it there.

372
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,158
- It was a cold day. - You had a sore throat.

373
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:29,328
- I caught a cold afterwards. - Right.

374
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,497
I had a sore throat.

375
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,398
I yelled so much.

376
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,798
The frame was set.

377
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,267
I went in and out of the frame.

378
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,837
We connected three events in one.

379
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,538
There were about 4 to 5 scenes.

380
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:45,107
I had to say, "Let's go," about four times.

381
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,507
My voice was gone on the fifth.

382
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:52,278
Wasn't the scene where Yoon Ah acted cute great?

383
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:53,818
She was cute.

384
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:57,257
She took a video of herself.

385
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,918
The original line is different.

386
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,528
- It's "please give me." - Right.

387
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:02,987
She changed it to...

388
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:05,497
- "Please forgive me." - Seo Jin helped me.

389
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,227
We filmed it in the women's room in the evening.

390
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:08,967
Can you reenact it?

391
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,137
- The video will be shown. - Can you show it to us?

392
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,068
- How was it on the video? - The video?

393
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:16,607
- Wait, I was very worried. - Yes.

394
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,038
- Seriously. - Show us.

395
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,337
- Show us. - Seriously?

396
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:21,877
Just show us a little bit.

397
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:24,377
Do you want to be forgiven? Ask for forgiveness.

398
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:29,548
Dong Gu, please forgive me.

399
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:30,558
Make it cute.

400
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:32,587
Please forgive me.

401
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:34,627
- Make it adorable. - Please forgive me.

402
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,257
- Make it lovely. - Please...

403
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,597
It's strange in real life.

404
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:39,857
It's okay.

405
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:43,168
- Gosh. - We have...

406
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,967
many bloopers like this.

407
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,737
As I'm acting,

408
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:50,507
the situation of the scene is funny.

409
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:52,337
I think that I succeed...

410
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:54,948
when I make other actors laugh, so I make them laugh.

411
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,948
As you said before,

412
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:00,517
Yi Kyung has made me laugh a lot.

413
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:05,057
Yi Kyung does something very strange.

414
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,588
He makes his tongue into a triangle.

415
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,557
Then he licks his teeth. Yes, that's it.

416
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:14,997
I laughed a lot because of that.

417
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,128
Do you mean this?

418
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,168
- How does he do that? - I do it often.

419
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:24,007
Let's take a look at the bloopers.

420
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:25,534
That's good.

421
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:27,604
Time for food.

422
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,673
Which blooper is this?

423
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,243
It was time to feed Sol. It was hilarious.

424
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,213
- Sol's food time. - Sol's food time.

425
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:36,213
Right.

426
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:38,453
- The milk leaked. - How could anyone abandon her?

427
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:40,683
She probably had a reason.

428
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:41,784
- Is it this? - Yes.

429
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:43,253
What if she never comes?

430
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,324
Then we'll raise her.

431
00:17:45,324 --> 00:17:46,993
Didn't you see how she attracted guests?

432
00:17:47,394 --> 00:17:49,894
- I'm worried that she'll come. - It's a lot.

433
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:52,233
- How can we raise her? - Look at that.

434
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,463
Did it break?

435
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,503
Babies can eat like this.

436
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:58,804
That's not okay.

437
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:00,074
- That's funny. - Cut.

438
00:18:04,973 --> 00:18:06,314
Oh, this scene.

439
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,884
- Gosh. - Look at her hair.

440
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:10,983
Her hair.

441
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:13,584
- My goodness. - Your face...

442
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,584
looks like Wolverine.

443
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:18,693
Action.

444
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:20,253
I remember this.

445
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:21,794
(Jun Ki puts on his pants in 30 seconds.)

446
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:25,864
You can wear your pants without using your hands?

447
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:28,963
I can't believe we're watching it.

448
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:30,503
Wearing pants without hands?

449
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:36,374
If I fail this time, I'll do your work too.

450
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:39,144
If I succeed, I won't take part in it.

451
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:41,884
- I practiced so much. - Agree?

452
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:45,384
- All right. - I was surprised too.

453
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:49,423
He took them off too early.

454
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:53,024
Okay, let's do it. Let's go!

455
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:00,733
- Gosh. - That's so quick.

456
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,203
It was too quick.

457
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:03,774
(Putting them on too quickly was a mistake.)

458
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,274
We didn't have time to react.

459
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,604
Right, those pants...

460
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,614
are different from the ones I practiced with.

461
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:14,644
I asked the stylist to give me ones with a loose rubber band.

462
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,314
It was too easy.

463
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,413
Look at that. He's so quick.

464
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:19,854
Why is it working?

465
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,284
(It was too quick again.)

466
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:22,354
Action.

467
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:24,923
(Jun Ki can't use the spoon due to his makeup.)

468
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:26,624
(He tries to eat some stew.)

469
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,723
He sticks out his tongue.

470
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:35,064
- Gosh. - It made him laugh.

471
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:36,463
(He asks Yoon Ah for help.)

472
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:37,804
That's hilarious.

473
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:39,074
(What is it?)

474
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:40,544
(Why don't I hear cut?)

475
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:43,673
(He sticks out his tongue.)

476
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:47,084
(Jun Ki eats with a straw.)

477
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:49,844
- It was there. - It was already there.

478
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,483
- It's like he's drinking sikhye. - Do you have to eat like that?

479
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:57,253
Didn't I tell you I'll get fired if my makeup gets messed up?

480
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:03,094
- It's porridge. - That's right.

481
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:07,104
(Seo Jin is stuck in an archive room with someone she likes.)

482
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:09,034
This scene was so funny.

483
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:11,034
- It was great. - I agree.

484
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,003
- She looks so pretty... - Right.

485
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,374
at start.

486
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:16,574
(Her mustache is shown as she turns around.)

487
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:17,973
She has no idea.

488
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,374
- To be honest... - I can't help it.

489
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:21,743
(She's full of mustache.)

490
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:23,443
Her eyes are sparkling.

491
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:24,884
I...

492
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:28,554
What is it?

493
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:31,124
He could see my mustache.

494
00:20:31,693 --> 00:20:33,193
It was funny.

495
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,564
- Action. - Action.

496
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:37,594
(Jun Ki has trouble with too much hair.)

497
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:39,534
- There it is. - Marine.

498
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:42,263
I'll shave it.

499
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:45,834
I'll shave every hair on my body except on my head.

500
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:47,344
Don't worry, ma'am.

501
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:49,844
Marine!

502
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:54,183
Jun Ki.

503
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:59,513
Let's clap for Jun Ki who works hard.

504
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:01,554
That's what the director said.

505
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:04,693
After watching my acting, he told everyone to clap.

506
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:05,723
He praised me for working hard.

507
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,894
To be honest, I choked up.

508
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:11,364
(Jun Ki takes a shower after getting a full waxing.)

509
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:14,463
You startled me.

510
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:16,163
What do you think you're doing? Get out.

511
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:18,774
You should've made a noise so I could know you were here.

512
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:20,374
What noise do you expect me to make while taking a shower?

513
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:23,913
What happened?

514
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:26,314
What on earth happened?

515
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,144
It's nothing.

516
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:32,314
What do you mean? Where did it all go? Why is it so bare?

517
00:21:32,314 --> 00:21:34,054
Tell me. Where did it all go?

518
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:36,054
Why do you keep turning me around? It's nothing.

519
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:38,054
Turn around. Let me see. Where did it all go?

520
00:21:38,054 --> 00:21:39,153
Gosh. Stop.

521
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:40,923
- Where did it all go? - You jerk.

522
00:21:44,894 --> 00:21:46,034
Are you thankful? Are you?

523
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:48,263
(Feeling awkward, Jun Ki keeps covering himself with a doll.)

524
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,433
You're all weird. Are you guys here to give me a hard time?

525
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,534
Below the elephant.

526
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:52,104
Out of all animals, why was it an elephant?

527
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,233
Stop it.

528
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:55,903
Why did you put the doll there?

529
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:57,074
Do you know why I'm doing this?

530
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:00,513
She knows. She realized why.

531
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:02,943
- She realized why. - She definitely knows.

532
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,314
(The scene where Kim Seo Hyung has a runny nose.)

533
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:06,354
This is when I ate a whole tray of eggs.

534
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:07,423
This scene was amazing.

535
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:08,624
I didn't know you practiced so much.

536
00:22:09,884 --> 00:22:10,953
Why is there so much?

537
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:12,923
Wait a minute. That was too much.

538
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,294
(Second attempt!)

539
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:15,824
I think there was a bit too much yolk in that.

540
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:16,894
What was that?

541
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:18,364
- It was egg white. - Egg white?

542
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,634
- Listen to that sound. - I can't bear to watch that.

543
00:22:23,304 --> 00:22:25,604
(Jun Ki being interviewed while appearing on a home shopping show.)

544
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,733
Please explain in detail.

545
00:22:29,644 --> 00:22:30,644
So, you see...

546
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:32,713
I always...

547
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:37,084
(Second attempt!)

548
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,153
In detail?

549
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,983
Yes, concretely, in detail.

550
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:43,084
Does that correct your smile?

551
00:22:43,084 --> 00:22:44,923
- Yes, it corrects your smile. - Yes, that's right.

552
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:46,923
The corners of my mouth...

553
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:48,723
- used to hang down. - Does your mouth really water?

554
00:22:49,223 --> 00:22:50,564
- No, not as much. - This helps the corners...

555
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:51,794
go up like this.

556
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:56,263
I laughed at the sound of the director's laughter.

557
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:58,334
- So this was that scene. - Finally, we get to see this.

558
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:01,574
- The director made us laugh here. - He laughed so much back then.

559
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:03,173
Blow hard. Blow hard.

560
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:04,874
There you go.

561
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:07,983
The corners of your mouth were shaking.

562
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:10,753
You were really trying hard not to laugh.

563
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:14,584
We couldn't help laughing.

564
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:18,594
- That was so funny. - I laughed so hard that time.

565
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:20,794
(Jun Ki hides to avoid Writer Kwon's boyfriend.)

566
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:25,334
(The sound of the shower curtain falling.)

567
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:28,304
- You broke a lot of things, right? - What?

568
00:23:28,304 --> 00:23:29,763
Do you remember our first scene together?

569
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,304
(Jun Ki's impersonation of Lee Jung Jae in "Assassination".)

570
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:33,374
That was an amazing performance.

571
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:36,203
- I loved this. - The Japanese shot me six times.

572
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:39,314
- I shot that scene so many times. - You sure did.

573
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:41,983
May I do it over again?

574
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:45,253
I have two holes.

575
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:47,683
I got this one in Shanghai...

576
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:49,084
and this one in 1927.

577
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:51,153
I forget to say the year for this one.

578
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:52,824
I kept getting confused by the years.

579
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:55,094
(Jun Ki is getting prepared to shoot the bed scene with Shin Soo Jung.)

580
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:56,324
That was a tough scene.

581
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:57,733
You're right. I agree.

582
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,034
(Jun Ki and Du Shik burst into laughter.)

583
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:00,864
The two make a great team.

584
00:24:01,864 --> 00:24:03,433
Du Shik looks like he was really enjoying it.

585
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,334
Don't leave anywhere out. Put it on well.

586
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:06,574
- That'll do it. - He didn't have to try so hard.

587
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:08,443
- The sound was what was so funny. - I agree.

588
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,044
- Look at his armpits. - That was hilarious.

589
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:12,973
That part was so funny.

590
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:14,413
Gosh. That tickles.

591
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:17,044
We couldn't stop laughing.

592
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:18,153
All right. All right.

593
00:24:18,183 --> 00:24:20,554
In return, you have to keep your promise.

594
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:22,753
- Get me Shin Soo Jung's autograph. - I will. I will.

595
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,223
Don't miss a single spot. Put it on everywhere.

596
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:26,594
I'm home.

597
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,834
What are you two doing? It's extremely unpleasant.

598
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:34,064
If you look closely, we were laughing.

599
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,403
(The two have burst into laughter, but Seo Jin continues acting.)

600
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:37,774
They even turned their heads. They can't stop laughing.

601
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:40,304
We're laughing with our heads turned away.

602
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:43,943
What's wrong with these two?

603
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,973
Even in that situation, Seo Jin has a straight face.

604
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:48,213
- I can't believe her. - She didn't laugh.

605
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:49,913
That's right. Seo Jin didn't make many mistakes.

606
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:51,653
But when I do, I completely lose it.

607
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:52,814
- That's right. - That's right.

608
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:53,884
She can't stop laughing.

609
00:24:53,884 --> 00:24:54,884
(Dong Gu and Yoon Ah's scene comes to an end.)

610
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:57,753
Don't sniff like that. Gosh.

611
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:59,794
Look at him get angry again over a simple joke.

612
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:01,364
What's wrong with that guy?

613
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:02,364
I have no idea.

614
00:25:02,364 --> 00:25:04,463
(This is where Jun Ki's ad-libbing begins.)

615
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,503
The scent of that cream was nice.

616
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,304
That is so embarrassing.

617
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:14,644
It's so ugly.

618
00:25:16,274 --> 00:25:17,413
Where are they going?

619
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:19,173
Hey, where are you going?

620
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,513
Now, let's move on to the highlight of today.

621
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:23,013
Let's see the best episodes chosen by our viewers.

622
00:25:23,013 --> 00:25:24,483
We'll also see the scenes with narrations.

623
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,723
Which episodes will we be seeing?

624
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:29,183
Let's watch,

625
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:30,653
- "Anyone Can Become a Wolverine". - "Anyone Can Become a Wolverine".

626
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:32,193
Let's all take a look.

627
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:34,894
No, I don't mind

628
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:36,923
- It was later in this episode. - Don't feel overwhelmed

629
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,503
After all, I don't have a boyfriend now

630
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:41,634
But I wonder why you're...

631
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:42,963
Aren't you laughing out too loud?

632
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:45,903
- You're a good singer. - You said you couldn't sing.

633
00:25:45,903 --> 00:25:47,403
I'm the worst out of us six here.

634
00:25:48,074 --> 00:25:50,003
- No, you're a great singer. - that will talk to you

635
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:51,074
Just compelled by your gaze

636
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:52,374
- She's good. - She sure is good.

637
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:54,513
- This is the part. - We can see Seo Jin's passion.

638
00:25:55,144 --> 00:25:56,544
I wonder how hard she worked on this scene.

639
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:00,284
How did you shoot this scene?

640
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:01,953
- Look at her feet. - There was a stand-in.

641
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:03,554
- How did your feet go up like that? - I did it sitting down.

642
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,024
I'm sure you really banged your head on the floor.

643
00:26:06,854 --> 00:26:07,864
Was it that obvious?

644
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:09,564
Shouldn't you have been holding your head?

645
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:10,564
You're touching your hips.

646
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:12,134
- I hurt my hips and my head. - Your hips too?

647
00:26:14,134 --> 00:26:16,003
Sol, did you sleep well?

648
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:17,433
Did you sleep well, Yoon Ah?

649
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:19,173
Yes. How come you're up so early?

650
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:20,903
It all seems so long ago.

651
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:22,203
- Yes, you're right. - I agree.

652
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:23,844
- It's been so long. - It was earlier on in the drama.

653
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:26,213
In that scene, your eyes...

654
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:28,644
- you did your eyes yourself, right? - Yes, that's right.

655
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:30,013
I put on eyeliner.

656
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:31,054
Men should know how to do makeup as well.

657
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:32,084
Even so, how could he...

658
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:34,124
- He draws it longer each time. - He's so extreme.

659
00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:35,653
It gets longer each time.

660
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,524
I don't know why I did that myself.

661
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:40,054
- What ethnicity were you going for? - It was a setting.

662
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:43,693
The set seemed awkward at that time.

663
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:45,034
- In that scene? - You're right.

664
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:46,594
Gosh, I wonder...

665
00:26:46,594 --> 00:26:47,963
- It was filmed late at night. - when Du Shik will...

666
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:49,304
learn how to speak nicely.

667
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,834
- If you look at the baby... - Were you a writer?

668
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,733
What genre script do you write?

669
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:55,104
Well, you see, I write classic novels...

670
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,173
and publish a series on the internet.

671
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,243
It was for the baby.

672
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:58,473
I want to become a scenario writer.

673
00:26:58,473 --> 00:26:59,973
Du Shik isn't wearing glasses in this scene.

674
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:02,314
- He took it off. - I see.

675
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:04,513
- It was so long ago. - Please concentrate.

676
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,653
For a bag of chips,

677
00:27:06,653 --> 00:27:08,723
he even wrote a school president's speech...

678
00:27:08,723 --> 00:27:10,384
for an elementary school student in the neighborhood.

679
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:11,993
I wouldn't say he is a professional writer.

680
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:13,223
He just writes anything.

681
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:14,963
What did you just say?

682
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,794
Yi Kyung. You really have healthy teeth.

683
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:18,663
People ask me if I got them laminated.

684
00:27:18,663 --> 00:27:19,894
- They're actually my own teeth. - Your hair was short back then.

685
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,064
- Really? - I have good teeth.

686
00:27:22,203 --> 00:27:23,834
You dream of becoming a movie director,

687
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:24,834
but you got fired...

688
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,733
for putting a set on fire while roasting sweet potatoes.

689
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:29,144
Why are you bringing that up?

690
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,743
- He's getting started. - That's where it all starts.

691
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:32,943
He's getting fired up now.

692
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:33,943
It's the same thing, isn't it?

693
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,114
How is that the same?

694
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:37,814
Sweet potatoes and potatoes have different number of letters.

695
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,183
Why is the number of letters important?

696
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:40,354
The fact that you set it on fire is what's important.

697
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:41,483
Sweet potatoes and potatoes are clearly different.

698
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:42,784
What are you still doing here?

699
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:45,753
- What are you three doing? - We were ad-libbing, right?

700
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,054
You're right. Those lines were all ad-libs.

701
00:27:47,054 --> 00:27:48,493
We just had to make a lot of noise.

702
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:51,233
- I don't remember what we said. - There goes the spray.

703
00:27:51,564 --> 00:27:52,733
- That must've been cold. - It was.

704
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:55,034
Guys can be really childish.

705
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:57,874
Yoon Ah, you'll have to understand. The guys in this house are weird.

706
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,703
Wasn't this where it all started?

707
00:27:59,703 --> 00:28:01,003
This is when she started becoming violent.

708
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,703
- I see. - Seo Jin's violence started here.

709
00:28:03,703 --> 00:28:05,374
- You Chewbacca. - "Chewbacca"?

710
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,213
- There's a scene where she hits. - She sure did it a lot.

711
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,114
- She actually hit him for real. - Even during rehearsals.

712
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:11,054
- She really hit Du Shik. - She hit me with her fist.

713
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:12,854
- She hit Du Shik. - She hit him with her fist?

714
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:16,653
What does that have to do with Seo Jin?

715
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,693
You see, Chewbacca and Seo Jin...

716
00:28:18,854 --> 00:28:19,993
- Gosh. - My goodness.

717
00:28:19,993 --> 00:28:21,624
I told you not to mention that.

718
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:23,163
I won't! Are you satisfied?

719
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:25,733
Chewbacca.

720
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:27,263
Chewbacca.

721
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:28,963
- This was that scene, wasn't it? - My gosh.

722
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:31,933
- Du Shik was trying to stop them. - I was trying to stop the two.

723
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:33,874
He's older than you. You shouldn't behave that way.

724
00:28:33,874 --> 00:28:35,003
How dare you?

725
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:36,844
You two are no different.

726
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:38,713
These people are really strange.

727
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:39,874
Sol is a great actor.

728
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:43,344
Was deciding to stay here really the right thing to do?

729
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:48,824
- At that time... - There were two babies playing Sol.

730
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:52,294
Viewers began noticing there were two babies starting from part two.

731
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:53,493
During the first part, not many knew.

732
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,824
This was the stage where each of our characters...

733
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:58,894
began to settle in.

734
00:28:58,894 --> 00:28:59,894
- That's right. - You're right. You're right.

735
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:01,233
Why does she react like that?

736
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:04,604
(Anyone Can Become a Wolverine)

737
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:10,203
- Hey. - This scene.

738
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:11,943
- Look at his feet. - It was as additional scene, right?

739
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:13,144
- It was an additional scene. - That's right.

740
00:29:13,473 --> 00:29:15,183
That shooting was scheduled at the last minute.

741
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:16,713
Before you get in trouble again...

742
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,584
- This wasn't planned. - Yes. That wasn't planned.

743
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:20,784
- That's right. - It was added to the episode.

744
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:24,294
The director told me to practice.

745
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:26,923
It was the scene where we were surprised...

746
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,693
- by how easily Jin Ki got it on. - That's right.

747
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,663
Did you practice that at home?

748
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:34,834
- Yes. - According to the script?

749
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:36,503
- Actually... - Only the day before the shooting.

750
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:38,104
It seems like you worked really hard on that scene.

751
00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:41,074
The director sent me a clip to help me practice.

752
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:43,774
So if I fail,

753
00:29:43,774 --> 00:29:44,943
I'll do everything.

754
00:29:44,943 --> 00:29:46,173
It was a bit hard to watch.

755
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:47,784
- There was a reason I wore that. - What was it?

756
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:50,513
I couldn't show that I had shaved my hair.

757
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:52,614
- I see. You had already shaved it. - That's right.

758
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:53,683
At that time?

759
00:29:53,784 --> 00:29:56,253
It was probably the day before we filmed the second episode.

760
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,624
That's right. You're right.

761
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:03,933
The reason why I did that...

762
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,263
was because I wanted to amuse you two.

763
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,634
You pretended that you couldn't get it on.

764
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:11,473
That's right. I acted like I couldn't get it on.

765
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:12,834
- He was too good. - He was too good?

766
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,644
- It only took him two seconds. - Is that even possible?

767
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:15,644
What?

768
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:17,413
- What? - What?

769
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:21,584
- What are you doing? - Is this supposed to be possible?

770
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:24,413
If you try this, it's actually much easier than you think.

771
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:26,584
We should have...

772
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:28,723
- give him jeans. - Yi Kyung. That's gross.

773
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:31,524
How did he do that?

774
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:32,993
Are you guys crazy? What were you guys doing?

775
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:34,763
- We were just about to get to work. - Me too.

776
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:37,024
Hey. Where are you guys going?

777
00:30:37,024 --> 00:30:38,534
I did it. I clearly did it.

778
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:39,834
Count me out, okay?

779
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:42,064
You must have lost your mind.

780
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:44,003
- Come with me. - My goodness.

781
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:45,834
- She's the boss. - Did you really grab his ear?

782
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:49,144
No. She took it easy on me in that scene.

783
00:30:51,673 --> 00:30:52,943
Gosh. I'm exhausted.

784
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:54,814
Maybe it's because we have more guests now.

785
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:55,913
There's so much to clean.

786
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:56,983
You didn't even do much work.

787
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:58,884
This is the first time watching this together.

788
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:00,554
- You're right. - You're right.

789
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:01,953
- Really? - You're right.

790
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:02,953
This is the first time.

791
00:31:03,024 --> 00:31:04,854
Aren't you going to the library today?

792
00:31:04,854 --> 00:31:07,124
- So that you can play when I leave? - No.

793
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:09,423
Even the laundry room is pretty.

794
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:12,794
I found out that we had this room when I watched this scene.

795
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:15,733
- I had no way of finding it out. - Really?

796
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:17,774
I didn't need to go there.

797
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:20,644
- The house is really pretty. - It is.

798
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:23,074
I remember being really shocked when I first saw it.

799
00:31:23,544 --> 00:31:26,144
They could make over 400 dollars by selling 2 washing machines.

800
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:28,013
That's what I thought too.

801
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:29,913
We can just sell the projector.

802
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:34,223
- Gosh. - There's a reason for being broke.

803
00:31:34,223 --> 00:31:35,453
I guess these are all rented.

804
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:38,223
- I was really stressed then. - Why?

805
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:40,294
I couldn't get used to all these lines.

806
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:42,663
- Yes. - Normally, I don't have to...

807
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:44,763
boss people around like that.

808
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,663
Christmas was over a long time ago.

809
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,203
He helped me out a lot.

810
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:49,703
I did? What did I do?

811
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:51,604
He's really good at supporting others' roles.

812
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:53,604
His eyes were kind.

813
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:56,574
I heard that you were dumped because you were useless.

814
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:58,114
And you were caught while selling your ring.

815
00:31:58,114 --> 00:32:00,884
What's worse, I hear you still have feelings for her.

816
00:32:00,884 --> 00:32:02,314
- Who told you that? - Jun Ki.

817
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:05,354
If you watch closely, her eyes look lost.

818
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:08,884
- Can you see that? - I can't seem to focus.

819
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:10,223
- Because you were nervous? - Yes.

820
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:13,524
- Don't we look younger? - Who?

821
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:15,124
This is where it got easier.

822
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:16,324
From here.

823
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:19,163
You do look younger.

824
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:20,864
- We had just begun. - It was before we lost weight.

825
00:32:20,864 --> 00:32:22,003
- You're right. - You're right.

826
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:25,473
Can't you trust me or my future?

827
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:27,003
What?

828
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:29,243
- Time passes so quickly. - What?

829
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:31,274
I must go to the library. Bye.

830
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:34,513
Gosh.

831
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:37,713
- My only sister ignores me. - You look handsome.

832
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:41,524
It looks as if you still have your baby fat.

833
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:43,524
You're taking so long.

834
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,824
Who uses a brush like that?

835
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:48,394
- Gosh. - Here. He does.

836
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:49,864
- What are you doing? - Gosh, look at the brush.

837
00:32:49,864 --> 00:32:51,534
It's part of my character.

838
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:55,263
The t-zone gets oily easily. That's why you need to put a lot on.

839
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:56,804
He looks prettier.

840
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:58,703
This is for my shooting.

841
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:01,044
- What film is this for? - Do you know "X-Men"?

842
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:02,874
This is the Korean version of "X-Men",

843
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:04,774
- This was the beginning. - Yes.

844
00:33:05,513 --> 00:33:08,243
You even had to eat a whole cluster of bananas for a scene.

845
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:13,283
This will succeed for sure.

846
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,424
- You don't eat a lot these days. - No.

847
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:16,854
I think of them as snacks.

848
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:18,323
I assure it.

849
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:23,093
- I did eat a lot of bread here. - Yes.

850
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,694
I ate a lot in the beginning.

851
00:33:25,694 --> 00:33:27,203
We don't eat a lot nowadays.

852
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:29,604
- No. - They don't give us food now.

853
00:33:30,604 --> 00:33:33,174
- She broke another dish. - This was really funny.

854
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:34,973
I really love this scene.

855
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:39,613
When I shot this scene,

856
00:33:40,513 --> 00:33:44,053
I think I got slapped 5 times. Maybe 10 times.

857
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:48,924
But when they were shooting me, she'd slap me and laugh.

858
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:51,194
She must have found it funny.

859
00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:52,694
- But if... - I tried my best to not laugh.

860
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:55,593
But if I laugh with her, it would be an NG cut.

861
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:58,464
So I tried my best not to laugh.

862
00:33:58,464 --> 00:33:59,993
Do you think she laughed because it was funny?

863
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:03,803
Really? Really?

864
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:07,644
- I don't think so. - She laughed when it was my turn.

865
00:34:08,243 --> 00:34:10,303
I watch that scene often.

866
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,144
- You need to take these off. - Of course.

867
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,944
- She hit him so well. - It's so funny.

868
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:18,413
- She slapped really well. - It looks like it'd hurt.

869
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,254
- And after that... - Gosh.

870
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:24,924
This is when she laughed.

871
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:27,124
She was laughing. She really was.

872
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:31,694
Gosh. Gosh, the day has just begun. Gosh.

873
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,763
I'm sorry.

874
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:36,133
Stop apologizing and leave.

875
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:37,334
I'm really...

876
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:40,674
I'm sorry.

877
00:34:40,674 --> 00:34:42,703
- I like these two hands. - Me too.

878
00:34:42,703 --> 00:34:44,973
These two hands make it seem real.

879
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:46,413
- He really looks shocked. - Yes.

880
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:47,444
I really don't like her.

881
00:34:47,444 --> 00:34:49,584
She's just stressed because of her child.

882
00:34:49,843 --> 00:34:52,084
Why are you so easily angered these days?

883
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:54,084
Is it because of Soo Ah?

884
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:57,424
It's not like that.

885
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:59,294
Don't lie. I can see it on your face.

886
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:01,593
- Dong Gu. - It's not! It's not!

887
00:35:02,694 --> 00:35:04,834
- Why does he get so angry at him? - He's so angry.

888
00:35:05,363 --> 00:35:06,533
He's adorable.

889
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:12,604
Why throw a tantrum at me?

890
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,203
He called it a tantrum at first.

891
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:18,573
- It gets worse. - He calls them by worse names.

892
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:21,144
- Are we ready for shooting? - We're nearly ready.

893
00:35:22,144 --> 00:35:24,584
- Did we shoot it here? - Yes.

894
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,524
- This is the beginning. - He's here.

895
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:31,524
This is legendary.

896
00:35:31,524 --> 00:35:33,294
- It is. - It has to be.

897
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:36,163
I woke up at 4am for this make up.

898
00:35:36,163 --> 00:35:38,663
- It took you 3 hours, right? - I started at 4am.

899
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:40,803
I was unsatisfied by this...

900
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,604
because the rough details of this make up...

901
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:48,874
weren't shown on screen due to the pretty filter on our camera.

902
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:50,973
It looks pretty.

903
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:53,573
- He looks adorable, doesn't he? - Yes.

904
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:55,214
- He kept playing jokes on others. - He looks like a puppy.

905
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:57,783
- A puppy? - He did it to me too.

906
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,424
When I tap on the staffs' shoulders with that make up on,

907
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,654
they'd faint from shock.

908
00:36:02,654 --> 00:36:04,993
They'd be surprised when they see you for the first time.

909
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,493
- I was surprised too. - Yes.

910
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:09,394
Gosh, that was a long time ago.

911
00:36:09,394 --> 00:36:12,163
With that make up on, I can't read the script nor have meals.

912
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:14,604
- I can't go to the bathroom. - Is it because of the nails?

913
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:17,004
So this is one episode...

914
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:18,504
- It's a little dirty. - Yes.

915
00:36:18,504 --> 00:36:20,973
For the first shooting, I survived for 10 hours.

916
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,973
For 10 hours, or 13 hours to be exact.

917
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,714
- Did you go to the bathroom? - No.

918
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:26,874
On the second day, I had to go.

919
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:28,783
So Seung Won pulled down my pants for me.

920
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:32,354
He came to the bathroom and...

921
00:36:32,513 --> 00:36:33,924
You two must be really close.

922
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:36,254
Are you really close, or is this something else?

923
00:36:36,383 --> 00:36:38,624
I couldn't do it by myself. I couldn't do anything by myself.

924
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:39,993
- It was my first time. - Still.

925
00:36:39,993 --> 00:36:42,424
It's only natural that it was your first time.

926
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,993
Where are you going?

927
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:47,863
I need to go like... Gosh.

928
00:36:49,863 --> 00:36:52,133
I felt really sad. It took me three hours to finish it.

929
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:57,073
Jun Ki's episodes are funny but sad at the same time.

930
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:58,113
- Yes. - Yes.

931
00:36:58,113 --> 00:37:00,644
Maybe it's because we can relate to it,

932
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:01,913
but I feel sad.

933
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:05,254
- Gosh. - Gosh.

934
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:07,013
There are so many people.

935
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:09,084
See? His skin is so white.

936
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:10,823
See?

937
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:12,323
He's doing it with his bum.

938
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:16,894
These shoes we're wearing are for snow.

939
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:18,564
It was mine.

940
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:21,633
I started wearing them because I was cold, but they said it looked good.

941
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,363
It was so cold then.

942
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,874
I can't ruin the makeup.

943
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:27,004
Gosh.

944
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,144
- What is that? - What is he?

945
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:33,573
- Is that it? - Is it?

946
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:40,654
- It's this one. - That was a U-turn.

947
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:46,493
Look at his foot.

948
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:51,464
It's so embarrassing.

949
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:54,734
I'm sorry.

950
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:56,964
Be careful.

951
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:59,433
The music...

952
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,874
- It's so well incorporated. - I really love it.

953
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:10,783
I told Soo Ah to tidy up, but she left everything.

954
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:13,714
Is it that hard to tidy up?

955
00:38:13,714 --> 00:38:15,183
There's a Christmas tree.

956
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:16,953
When did that disappear?

957
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:19,823
What's this? What's this?

958
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:22,564
- It's me. - It's so funny.

959
00:38:22,564 --> 00:38:24,363
Jun Ki? Why do you look like that?

960
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,593
He's happy to see him, I guess.

961
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,004
- It's chaos. - Who started it?

962
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:33,743
It looks like fluorescent light up there.

963
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:35,444
- Gosh. - Don't live like that.

964
00:38:35,444 --> 00:38:39,274
Stop it. I'm embarrassed as is.

965
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:41,584
That's when you started eating bananas, right?

966
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,513
- We had so many. - We did.

967
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:50,624
Can you hold this up to my ear?

968
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:55,294
Hello? This is he.

969
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:58,194
What? The police station?

970
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,933
I caught a thief and found your wallet on him.

971
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:03,904
My wallet? Just wait.

972
00:39:05,073 --> 00:39:07,674
What is this? Gosh.

973
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:12,013
Yes. I'll be there right away. Yes.

974
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:15,013
- Turn it off. - Wait. Are you going like that?

975
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:17,453
Then what should I do? My personal identification card,

976
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,214
my card and my money... Wait, I don't have money.

977
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:22,024
Scums.

978
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:25,254
Gosh, no one's normal.

979
00:39:25,254 --> 00:39:27,993
It seems like a page of my memory has come back.

980
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:29,924
The drama hasn't ended yet,

981
00:39:29,924 --> 00:39:32,163
- but... - Who did this?

982
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:35,863
We were worried about how to shoot these scenes.

983
00:39:35,863 --> 00:39:38,404
- These might all get spoiled. - We went through a lot.

984
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:41,473
- We succeeded. - This must have been her doing.

985
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:43,944
- It is. - Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

986
00:39:46,573 --> 00:39:48,343
Yes, did you call for me?

987
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:51,314
Did you do all this?

988
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:53,683
I was cleaning the refrigerator when Sol started crying.

989
00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:56,154
I'll finish up soon.

990
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:57,993
She's good at acting things like that.

991
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:01,863
She keeps doing that. That's the problem.

992
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:05,093
- You should throw this away. - Sure. Sure.

993
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:08,564
Yes, you had a meal now. You need to go to sleep.

994
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:11,604
Isn't that mushroom...

995
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:14,374
that they let rot on purpose?

996
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:15,604
- They grew it in the bathroom. - Yes.

997
00:40:15,604 --> 00:40:18,274
- The mold is still there? - It's at the director's office.

998
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:21,714
- I thought it was at the toilet. - He kept it there.

999
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:24,383
- At the toilet? - He did.

1000
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:26,984
I was surprised every time I went in.

1001
00:40:27,183 --> 00:40:29,053
- It's still growing up. - Still?

1002
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:30,124
It's just right there.

1003
00:40:30,124 --> 00:40:31,493
Really?

1004
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:34,194
I'll take care of Sol. You should clean this up first.

1005
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:36,223
But I feel sorry.

1006
00:40:36,223 --> 00:40:39,464
It's fine. I don't have anything to do before work.

1007
00:40:39,593 --> 00:40:40,703
- And... - It's coming.

1008
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:43,604
Sol likes me so much.

1009
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:46,234
Right, Sol?

1010
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:48,674
- What was that? - It was some kind of yogurt.

1011
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:50,303
He seems to be like an octopus.

1012
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,013
An octopus.

1013
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:55,243
He must have been ready.

1014
00:40:55,243 --> 00:40:56,584
- She's adorable. - Gosh.

1015
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,413
- Sol is so pretty. - A yogurt?

1016
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,484
I had to do that several times because we didn't succeed at once.

1017
00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:07,163
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

1018
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:08,723
Be nice, and let me go.

1019
00:41:09,624 --> 00:41:12,033
Do you want to get hit, you punk?

1020
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:13,904
Excuse me.

1021
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,163
How can I help you?

1022
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,303
What's this?

1023
00:41:18,504 --> 00:41:19,803
Who are you?

1024
00:41:19,803 --> 00:41:21,874
I received a call.

1025
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:24,473
I'm Lee Jun Ki. I heard that my wallet is here.

1026
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:25,874
Please move the gun away.

1027
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:29,913
Are you the victim whom I spoke with?

1028
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:31,913
- Yes. - You startled me.

1029
00:41:31,913 --> 00:41:33,484
What's wrong with your face?

1030
00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:36,183
You shot many scenes like that.

1031
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:41,223
He goes somewhere alone and tries to do something.

1032
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:43,363
Jun Ki is...

1033
00:41:43,363 --> 00:41:45,763
in charge of funny stories.

1034
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,763
- You're right. - Funny incidents.

1035
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:49,633
He's a troublemaker.

1036
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,203
- Are you Lee Jun Ki? - Yes, that's me.

1037
00:41:53,203 --> 00:41:54,573
While shooting this show,

1038
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:56,374
I've met many people outside.

1039
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:57,644
- You're right. - Including the actors...

1040
00:41:57,644 --> 00:41:58,644
who made a special appearance.

1041
00:41:58,644 --> 00:41:59,973
Take a close look. It's me.

1042
00:41:59,973 --> 00:42:00,944
I look the same.

1043
00:42:00,944 --> 00:42:02,214
I can't verify because of the makeup.

1044
00:42:02,214 --> 00:42:04,084
Can you remove it?

1045
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:06,513
No, if I mess it up, I'll lose my role.

1046
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,354
Let's check the fingerprint. Give me your finger.

1047
00:42:09,354 --> 00:42:10,354
Fingerprint?

1048
00:42:13,924 --> 00:42:15,924
Can I pull out the hair?

1049
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,633
No, if you mess it up, I'll lose my role.

1050
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:20,363
What else can I do?

1051
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:21,964
Can I get a DNA test?

1052
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:23,064
You can draw my blood.

1053
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:25,734
Run a DNA test to identify you?

1054
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:28,473
We have to send your blood and hair to National Forensic Service.

1055
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:29,644
Is that too much?

1056
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:32,044
But it's my wallet.

1057
00:42:32,044 --> 00:42:33,274
Please give it back to me.

1058
00:42:33,274 --> 00:42:35,944
I can't until I verify your identity.

1059
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:38,484
The other actor did such an amazing job.

1060
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:41,553
I ad-libbed a lot, but he played along every time.

1061
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:42,823
We never had to stop.

1062
00:42:42,823 --> 00:42:44,823
He said I can't get it without checking my identity.

1063
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:46,354
How can he be a detective...

1064
00:42:46,354 --> 00:42:47,723
when he's not keen?

1065
00:42:47,723 --> 00:42:50,223
No makeup can cover up...

1066
00:42:50,223 --> 00:42:51,234
my handsome face.

1067
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:52,294
That's an awesome line.

1068
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:53,363
I'm home.

1069
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:54,964
Chewbacca, did you go to Busan?

1070
00:42:54,964 --> 00:42:56,033
She hit me in that scene.

1071
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:57,303
The stew looked tasty.

1072
00:42:57,303 --> 00:42:58,303
Goodness.

1073
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:00,473
It hurt so much.

1074
00:43:00,473 --> 00:43:02,473
But it doesn't look like it.

1075
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:04,314
- What happened to you? - I don't know.

1076
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:06,144
I should practice hitting.

1077
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:07,183
You did a good job.

1078
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:08,714
I didn't know that it was you.

1079
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,913
If you had known, you would've hit me with the corner.

1080
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:14,854
Thank you for hitting me with the surface.

1081
00:43:15,624 --> 00:43:16,883
Let's eat.

1082
00:43:16,883 --> 00:43:18,294
Look at Seo Jin.

1083
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:20,593
It's mushroom stew.

1084
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:22,763
That's the problematic line.

1085
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:25,133
Du Shik was serving rice.

1086
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:27,234
It was edited so flawlessly.

1087
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,734
Like a flowing river.

1088
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:30,803
"A flowing river"?

1089
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:34,644
Dong Gu saved that scene.

1090
00:43:35,843 --> 00:43:37,413
Your tongue is so long.

1091
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:38,714
Your tongue.

1092
00:43:41,544 --> 00:43:43,544
The soup is delicious.

1093
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:45,013
Don't you think, Dong Gu?

1094
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:47,124
Well, it's not bad.

1095
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,424
I'm glad to hear that.

1096
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:50,323
I was worried that you wouldn't like it.

1097
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:52,254
Sol did a great job.

1098
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:55,124
- You're right. - With her eyes.

1099
00:43:55,124 --> 00:43:56,194
Her eyes...

1100
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:57,533
Okay.

1101
00:44:02,863 --> 00:44:03,904
Look at that.

1102
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:05,274
Are you an animal?

1103
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:06,633
"Are you an animal?"

1104
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:10,374
Yoon Ah, I have a favor to ask.

1105
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:11,913
What is it?

1106
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:17,214
Is that where Jun Ki clapped his hands?

1107
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:19,383
Maybe not in this scene.

1108
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,854
- I think he did. - Maybe it got cut out.

1109
00:44:22,084 --> 00:44:24,354
- Did you see? - Did you see Sol's face?

1110
00:44:24,354 --> 00:44:27,524
I lose my role if I mess up the makeup.

1111
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,524
Look at Sol's face.

1112
00:44:29,524 --> 00:44:30,533
Her eyes.

1113
00:44:30,964 --> 00:44:32,663
She's an actress.

1114
00:44:32,663 --> 00:44:35,033
It's nice and spicy. It's delicious.

1115
00:44:35,104 --> 00:44:36,133
Help yourself.

1116
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:40,004
Did you really have the stew with a straw?

1117
00:44:40,004 --> 00:44:41,703
- Yes. - Yes.

1118
00:44:44,644 --> 00:44:47,683
Hello? Soo Ah, can you meet me just once?

1119
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:49,484
Just give me one minute.

1120
00:44:49,484 --> 00:44:50,484
No way.

1121
00:44:50,484 --> 00:44:51,553
I'll explain everything.

1122
00:44:51,553 --> 00:44:53,553
We can't break up like this.

1123
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:54,683
Hello?

1124
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:56,783
She hung up again. Let me call again.

1125
00:44:57,854 --> 00:44:58,854
"Let me call again."

1126
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:02,064
Gosh, my stomach hurts. Why is this happening?

1127
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:07,763
He went outside in those clothes.

1128
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:09,604
- It was very cold. - I know.

1129
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,674
- It was really cold. - It was my first scene.

1130
00:45:11,774 --> 00:45:13,334
- It was minus 16°C. - It was your first scene?

1131
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:15,703
It was really cold,

1132
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:18,473
but it doesn't look cold. You'll see.

1133
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:21,283
It was my first scene, and it was a cold day.

1134
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:22,343
But it doesn't look like it.

1135
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:23,814
The scene looked very pretty.

1136
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:26,883
Does your stomach hurt?

1137
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:28,053
Yours too?

1138
00:45:28,283 --> 00:45:31,154
It's a shame that the diaper part got cut out.

1139
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:32,323
Right.

1140
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:35,424
You two went looking for Sol's diapers.

1141
00:45:35,424 --> 00:45:37,834
- Right. - You wanted to poop in them.

1142
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:39,133
What did we eat wrong?

1143
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:40,933
What did we eat for lunch?

1144
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,964
Mushroom stew, kimchi, and...

1145
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:45,133
Mushroom stew?

1146
00:45:46,504 --> 00:45:47,504
No way.

1147
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:53,783
What's wrong?

1148
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,584
By any chance,

1149
00:45:58,783 --> 00:45:59,814
did you make...

1150
00:46:00,354 --> 00:46:01,854
that stew with these mushrooms?

1151
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:03,723
Yes. Why?

1152
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:05,354
What do you mean by why?

1153
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:06,624
She looks so innocent.

1154
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:08,663
Isn't it so obvious...

1155
00:46:09,593 --> 00:46:10,834
those mushrooms could kill you?

1156
00:46:11,493 --> 00:46:12,564
They're poisonous.

1157
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:14,734
They'd grow in your stomach.

1158
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,834
Everyone's sick now!

1159
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:19,473
- Oh, my. - He's good at those things.

1160
00:46:19,573 --> 00:46:20,573
He is.

1161
00:46:20,573 --> 00:46:21,774
His great acting began.

1162
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:23,703
I became the pooper.

1163
00:46:23,944 --> 00:46:25,573
That's a great scene.

1164
00:46:26,073 --> 00:46:27,243
When he starts running...

1165
00:46:27,444 --> 00:46:28,513
Right now.

1166
00:46:32,214 --> 00:46:33,453
Dong Gu!

1167
00:46:35,553 --> 00:46:37,024
That was my first scene.

1168
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:39,453
The great scene starts now.

1169
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:40,894
Look at the color of his lips.

1170
00:46:42,894 --> 00:46:44,533
Many people asked me...

1171
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:45,993
why his lips were purple.

1172
00:46:46,564 --> 00:46:47,834
It was cold outside.

1173
00:46:47,863 --> 00:46:50,203
- It was really cold. - It was.

1174
00:46:50,203 --> 00:46:51,533
But it doesn't show.

1175
00:46:53,303 --> 00:46:54,874
- He's running. - It looks so warm.

1176
00:46:57,274 --> 00:46:58,374
Gosh.

1177
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:00,044
You watch the show home,

1178
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:01,714
where it's nice and warm.

1179
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:04,913
- It was very cold. - His acting is so detailed.

1180
00:47:04,913 --> 00:47:07,084
The director loves that scene.

1181
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:09,154
Where he dragged his feet.

1182
00:47:13,723 --> 00:47:15,493
(Out of order)

1183
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:20,334
He's good with his legs.

1184
00:47:20,334 --> 00:47:21,633
It's amazing.

1185
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:25,803
What are you doing now?

1186
00:47:25,803 --> 00:47:27,243
It was windy, right?

1187
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:28,303
- It was. - Very windy.

1188
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,374
Look at his hair.

1189
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:30,843
It looks like some kind of lid.

1190
00:47:30,843 --> 00:47:31,874
Look at Soo Ah.

1191
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:33,343
Wait, wait!

1192
00:47:33,343 --> 00:47:35,484
The bridge above is...

1193
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:37,354
the one I just crossed.

1194
00:47:38,613 --> 00:47:39,754
Singing the national anthem.

1195
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:42,323
I'll give you a minute. What do you want to tell me?

1196
00:47:42,883 --> 00:47:43,993
I mean...

1197
00:47:47,124 --> 00:47:48,894
We're seeing his bottom so many times.

1198
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:51,163
Only the bottom.

1199
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:54,104
Could you please wait here?

1200
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:55,504
There's no life in your lips.

1201
00:47:55,504 --> 00:47:56,964
I'll say it now then!

1202
00:47:58,104 --> 00:48:00,033
- Why is this happening now? - His lips explain everything.

1203
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:01,104
It's the color of poisonous mushrooms.

1204
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:02,703
I'll tell you now.

1205
00:48:04,743 --> 00:48:05,743
Soo Ah.

1206
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,613
It's all my fault.

1207
00:48:07,883 --> 00:48:09,743
- I'm so sorry. - What are you sorry for?

1208
00:48:10,283 --> 00:48:11,783
You did a great job on your first day.

1209
00:48:11,783 --> 00:48:12,913
Exactly.

1210
00:48:12,913 --> 00:48:13,953
This scene...

1211
00:48:14,053 --> 00:48:15,053
Be specific?

1212
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:16,424
Didn't I read those lines...

1213
00:48:16,424 --> 00:48:18,024
in the audition?

1214
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,854
- That's right. - In the audition,

1215
00:48:19,854 --> 00:48:21,464
I read those lines.

1216
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,424
He was still polite back then.

1217
00:48:24,263 --> 00:48:25,263
Back then...

1218
00:48:25,263 --> 00:48:26,493
I tried to sell our couple rings.

1219
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:27,504
And?

1220
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:29,303
I'm irresponsible.

1221
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:31,004
- And? - Is there more?

1222
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,444
You are right. It's...

1223
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:35,774
What was that?

1224
00:48:36,674 --> 00:48:38,714
That's so funny.

1225
00:48:41,783 --> 00:48:42,843
Look at his face.

1226
00:48:43,183 --> 00:48:44,254
Your face.

1227
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,453
Did you just fart...

1228
00:48:45,883 --> 00:48:47,013
in this situation?

1229
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,323
I love that line.

1230
00:48:48,683 --> 00:48:49,754
It was this noise.

1231
00:48:50,124 --> 00:48:52,093
You even joke in this kind of situation.

1232
00:48:52,354 --> 00:48:53,424
Forget it. Let's end this.

1233
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:56,024
Wait, Soo Ah! It's not what you think!

1234
00:48:58,363 --> 00:48:59,464
My bottom again.

1235
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:05,674
You are not even stopping me anymore.

1236
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,243
I would love to do that, but...

1237
00:49:07,243 --> 00:49:09,644
Forget it. We are really done.

1238
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:10,814
That day,

1239
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:13,613
the cameramen shot only his bottom for a while.

1240
00:49:14,613 --> 00:49:16,044
He kept filming his bottom.

1241
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:18,214
Both cameramen.

1242
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,854
His hands...

1243
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:20,924
I'm sorry.

1244
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:26,794
My stomach aches just by watching it.

1245
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:29,993
He shot this right after the previous scene.

1246
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:31,493
Right.

1247
00:49:32,493 --> 00:49:33,533
It was still cold.

1248
00:49:36,203 --> 00:49:37,573
There was some sun at least.

1249
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,843
The salesman was a great actor too.

1250
00:49:40,843 --> 00:49:42,073
Right.

1251
00:49:42,073 --> 00:49:43,544
- He did a great job. - Right.

1252
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:44,714
He was amazing.

1253
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:49,683
It sounds so dramatic.

1254
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:54,053
(Public toilets for sales)

1255
00:49:54,053 --> 00:49:56,223
You can look around first.

1256
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,624
This kind of portable toilets are...

1257
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,294
quite popular these days.

1258
00:50:00,294 --> 00:50:01,524
- Would you like to look at it? - Okay.

1259
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:04,263
Why is it locked?

1260
00:50:05,194 --> 00:50:07,464
- What's going on? - It's occupied.

1261
00:50:07,703 --> 00:50:09,663
Who is this?

1262
00:50:11,104 --> 00:50:12,604
Do I have to tell you that?

1263
00:50:12,604 --> 00:50:13,803
What are you doing there?

1264
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:16,444
Please wait, I'm almost done.

1265
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:18,274
"Almost done"? Done with what?

1266
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:19,644
What a weird man.

1267
00:50:19,774 --> 00:50:22,144
It's a toilet. Of course, I'm pooping. Should I cook here?

1268
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,444
What did you say?

1269
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:24,754
What are you talking about?

1270
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:26,513
Get out!

1271
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:27,883
Get out of there right now!

1272
00:50:27,883 --> 00:50:29,283
What is he doing?

1273
00:50:29,283 --> 00:50:32,323
I'm almost done. I'll see you out there.

1274
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:33,624
Look.

1275
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:36,424
What are you doing here? This is my business property.

1276
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,033
I'm sorry.

1277
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:41,163
I thought this was a public toilet. I was really in a hurry.

1278
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,703
I don't care if you were in a hurry or not.

1279
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:44,004
This is a new product.

1280
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:46,803
How could you poop there?

1281
00:50:46,874 --> 00:50:48,073
- What are you going to do? - It was his first day.

1282
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,774
Was it your first day?

1283
00:50:50,774 --> 00:50:51,774
Yes.

1284
00:50:52,073 --> 00:50:54,644
I'm really sorry. I'll take care of it.

1285
00:50:55,044 --> 00:50:56,183
Dong Gu?

1286
00:50:58,383 --> 00:50:59,413
Yoon Ah?

1287
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:01,124
I love when the focus moves.

1288
00:51:01,283 --> 00:51:03,953
You all got food poisoning from me, so I went to get some medicine.

1289
00:51:04,993 --> 00:51:08,323
But Dong Gu, did you really poop in there?

1290
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:11,964
- That's... - It's such a mess.

1291
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:13,433
He pooped so much in there.

1292
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:14,863
Goodness.

1293
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:16,933
Mighty Dong Gu did.

1294
00:51:27,144 --> 00:51:28,214
Dong Gu.

1295
00:51:29,144 --> 00:51:30,484
Isn't that too much?

1296
00:51:31,513 --> 00:51:35,984
I remember the time and mood during when we shot the scenes.

1297
00:51:35,984 --> 00:51:37,654
- I remember them. - Right.

1298
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:40,564
After today, I realized there aren't enough bathrooms.

1299
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,823
- It's fun to watch it together. - I agree.

1300
00:51:43,064 --> 00:51:44,694
- It feels new. - Yes.

1301
00:51:47,163 --> 00:51:49,064
Where did that bathroom go?

1302
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,834
- I know. - It's still on the film set.

1303
00:51:51,473 --> 00:51:52,703
Is it?

1304
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,573
People brought it up for our tent scene.

1305
00:51:56,573 --> 00:51:59,174
- For the tent scene? - They said we could use it...

1306
00:51:59,174 --> 00:52:01,944
- for Yoon Ah. - I'm sorry.

1307
00:52:02,383 --> 00:52:04,254
You should've been more careful.

1308
00:52:04,553 --> 00:52:06,383
That's the only award that Dong Gu won.

1309
00:52:06,383 --> 00:52:08,183
It's his only award.

1310
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:10,993
I'm sorry.

1311
00:52:10,993 --> 00:52:13,194
- It's glued back. - It's okay.

1312
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,464
Wouldn't it be funny if it's glued upside down?

1313
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:19,663
Don't worry.

1314
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:22,064
What happened? You told her to pack up and leave earlier.

1315
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:23,803
That was like a shock tactic.

1316
00:52:23,803 --> 00:52:25,803
I'm kind of supporting her to do a better job in the future.

1317
00:52:27,243 --> 00:52:30,743
Yoon Ah, forget about what happened so far.

1318
00:52:31,113 --> 00:52:33,314
- Look at his eyes. - He looks scary.

1319
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:34,944
He looks scary.

1320
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:37,413
Okay.

1321
00:52:37,413 --> 00:52:39,413
The background music was the same as on the set.

1322
00:52:39,413 --> 00:52:41,453
- It changed. - It's because of my acting.

1323
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:42,984
That's why.

1324
00:52:42,984 --> 00:52:44,894
We couldn't use the same music.

1325
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:48,124
- Don't worry. - That look was too strong.

1326
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:50,894
- Thank you. - Look at him.

1327
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:52,894
"Thank you."

1328
00:52:57,803 --> 00:53:00,604
- He's coming for another blooper. - Hello.

1329
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:07,814
That actor often plays as a bus driver.

1330
00:53:08,444 --> 00:53:10,714
He knows how to drive a bus.

1331
00:53:10,714 --> 00:53:12,553
- Really? - I saw him playing...

1332
00:53:12,553 --> 00:53:14,354
a bus driver in something else.

1333
00:53:14,354 --> 00:53:16,924
It's fine. I'll pick it up later. Go have a seat.

1334
00:53:18,024 --> 00:53:19,093
I'm sorry.

1335
00:53:23,064 --> 00:53:24,433
I'm sorry.

1336
00:53:25,064 --> 00:53:26,093
Gosh.

1337
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:28,433
What am I doing now?

1338
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:30,263
I love the background music for this scene.

1339
00:53:30,504 --> 00:53:31,734
- Me too. - This is so...

1340
00:53:31,734 --> 00:53:35,604
It was my first time hearing that part of the song.

1341
00:53:38,444 --> 00:53:40,144
He also played well.

1342
00:53:40,144 --> 00:53:41,383
A mutant?

1343
00:53:42,214 --> 00:53:44,613
- This actor... - He appeared several times.

1344
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:46,013
- He appeared three times. - He keeps appearing.

1345
00:53:47,283 --> 00:53:50,024
He looks cute. Look at his facial expression.

1346
00:53:50,424 --> 00:53:51,654
It's a sad look.

1347
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:57,263
He also got his makeup where I was.

1348
00:53:57,263 --> 00:53:59,133
It didn't take long to paint.

1349
00:53:59,763 --> 00:54:02,133
Surgical glue was used to attach the objects.

1350
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:04,803
He had a hard time taking them off.

1351
00:54:05,604 --> 00:54:08,944
He had to take them off to go home, but it wasn't easy.

1352
00:54:12,774 --> 00:54:16,714
Did you enjoy our commentary special?

1353
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:19,883
We prepared a lot of fun entertaining content for tomorrow.

1354
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:21,254
Please look forward to it.

1355
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:22,924
Say it together.

1356
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:24,794
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1357
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,593
Aloha.

1358
00:54:26,593 --> 00:54:28,493
Waikiki.

1359
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:33,964
(Behind the scene discussion)

1360
00:54:36,104 --> 00:54:37,573
Why can't I do it?

1361
00:54:39,703 --> 00:54:40,973
I can't do it.

1362
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:42,104
I got it!

1363
00:54:42,944 --> 00:54:46,044
(More bloopers and deleted scenes will be shown.)

1364
00:54:46,674 --> 00:54:49,383
(Stay tuned for tomorrow's commentary special.)
