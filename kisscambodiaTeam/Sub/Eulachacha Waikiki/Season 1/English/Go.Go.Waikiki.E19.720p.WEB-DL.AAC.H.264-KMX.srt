3
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:12,615
<i>I'm sorry, Seo Jin.</i>

4
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:16,143
<i>But it's a really important
opportunity for me.</i>

5
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:19,522
<i>Can you understand just this once?</i>

6
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:20,853
All right.

7
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:23,045
Really? Really?

8
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:25,053
You're not angry right now, are you?

9
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:27,102
No, I'm not angry.

10
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:28,189
<i>Are you sure?</i>

11
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:29,564
You're okay, right?

12
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:32,030
Yes, I'm really okay.

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,441
Thank you, Seo Jin. Thank you so much.

14
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,515
<i>Then, see you later at home.</i>

15
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:44,085
I'm okay.

16
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:47,774
I really am.

17
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:51,097
I'm really okay.

18
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,128
What? You're going to sign
a contract with YS Entertainment?

19
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:57,502
That's right.

20
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:01,490
That's great. They're a big company
with lots of famous celebrities.

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,676
People are finally seeing
Lee Joon Ki's potential.

22
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,847
That's true.

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,933
Oh yeah, Seo Jin.

24
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:13,299
I'm really sorry for
breaking my promise to you today.

25
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,340
No, it's okay.
It was for work, after all.

26
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,067
You suffered for so long without
an agency. Congratulations.

27
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,117
Thank you.

28
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:25,796
Joon Ki, are you going to become
really famous now?

29
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:28,194
I wonder if I should
get your autograph now.

30
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:31,015
Actually, I came up with
a new autograph today.

31
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:33,025
- Should I do it for you?
- Oh, yes.

32
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:34,459
Okay.

33
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:39,503
I will now start my first autograph.
Let me start the process.

34
00:01:42,257 --> 00:02:15,576
Lee...

35
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:17,587
Oh, I fell asleep.

36
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,830
Joon Ki, you're not finished yet?

37
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,456
You have to wait a little longer.

38
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:25,439
I'll head in first, then.

39
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,653
I have to study for my baking license.

40
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,449
Ah, I see.

41
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:33,320
I'll bring it to your room
once it's finished.

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,413
Okay.

43
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:38,055
So, the Lee part is done.

44
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:56,213
Joon...

45
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:58,057
<i>[Dancer in the Dark]</i>

46
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:02,677
Yes, Father.

47
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:05,010
I'm on my way to sign the contract.

48
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,877
Donâ€™t worry about it.
I read over the contract thoroughly.

49
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:13,804
Yes, I'll call once I'm back. Okay.

50
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:16,631
- What did he say? He's happy, right?
- Yes.

51
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,509
He doesn't show it much,
but I can tell he's very happy.

52
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,903
Ah, who knew this day
would come for you, Joon Ki?

53
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,925
This is a complete change
in your life, isn't it?

54
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,304
You're right.

55
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,004
So many things happened in my
10 years as an unknown actor.

56
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:32,366
I suppose you did suffer quite a lot.

57
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:35,425
<i>Are you going to
read your lines like that?</i>

58
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,235
<i>Let go, you punk!</i>

59
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:38,344
<i>I'll pull it off now.</i>

60
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,757
<i>Octopus ink!</i>

61
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,646
Just thinking about it is terrifying.

62
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:45,973
- I'll be going.
- Okay.

63
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:51,070
Why is Su Ah leaving all of
the shopping mall work to me?

64
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,302
What is she doing?

65
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:56,161
<i>Doo Shik, Doo Shik!</i>

66
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,415
Look at this.

67
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:00,211
What's with all the fuss?
What is that?

68
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:01,962
I designed it myself.

69
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:05,862
I think Soorgio Armhany will be
limited if we only sell other labels.

70
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,293
Oh, so you want to sell clothes
you've designed yourself?

71
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,693
Yes. Do you want to see?

72
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,288
Ta-da!

73
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:17,392
Soorgio Armhany 2018 S/S,
Vintage Collection.

74
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:19,964
Ultra V-neck knit.
What do you think?

75
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:23,814
Oh, but why is the chest cut so low?

76
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:28,288
Basic v-necks are so normal
and they don't feel sexy.

77
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:32,199
This one has the V-neck going
all the way to the belly button.

78
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,728
It's emphasizing the sexiness.

79
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:36,168
What do you think? Cool, right?

80
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:40,617
It's not bad,
but I think it's cut too low.

81
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:42,367
No, it's fine.

82
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,428
These days, dramatic clothes
like this are what works.

83
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,826
- Why aren't you putting it on?
- What?

84
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:52,199
You want me to wear it? Why?

85
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,855
You're the model.
Take a picture and put it online.

86
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,199
What? Me?

87
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,872
When, where, what, how, why?

88
00:04:57,872 --> 00:04:59,975
Do it if the president tells you to.
Don't question me.

89
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:00,992
Just follow me.

90
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:03,757
Why do I have to do it?
I'm not feeling well.

91
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:05,043
I said follow me!

92
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,209
Why should I? It shows the belly button!

93
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,259
So, do you like the contract conditions?

94
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,971
Yes, I do.

95
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:20,533
Then, let's sign.

96
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:22,548
Should I?

97
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:34,365
Lee...

98
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,165
Still not done?

99
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:51,627
Ki...

100
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,408
Oh, I'm done now.

101
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:56,151
Oh, are you?

102
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:58,283
Then, let's work well together
from now on.

103
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:00,781
Yes, let's work well together.

104
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:05,415
So, then...

105
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:12,475
the baby tiger and the dad tiger
lived happily ever after.

106
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:14,954
The end!

107
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:19,404
Sol, what do you think was
the important point of the story?

108
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:23,283
The point of this story
was the dad... the dad.

109
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,423
So, try and say daddy.

110
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:29,723
You are so hard to get, really.

111
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,583
Now, go on and say daddy.

112
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,857
Just say it once, okay?

113
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:39,187
- Say daddy.
- What are you doing?

114
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:42,678
Just reading Sol a book.

115
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,245
What is that cold-looking, bummy shirt?

116
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,874
What? Cold and bummy?

117
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:54,026
It's just too cold-looking
for a piece of clothing.

118
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:55,791
Where did you buy that?

119
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,355
I didn't buy it.
Su Ah designed it herself.

120
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:01,798
What? Su Ah is making clothes?

121
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,954
Yes, and that's not all.

122
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:06,089
She needs to promote it,
so I have to keep wearing it.

123
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,773
Min Su Ah is not a normal person either.

124
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:11,894
- I'm home.
- Hey, you're home?

125
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:15,627
- You're home? Did the signing go well?
- Yeah, it did.

126
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:19,410
What is that cold-looking, bummy shirt?

127
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,850
Su Ah designed it.
It's so funny, isn't it?

128
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,536
Yeah, I can even see your belly button.

129
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:29,192
Is it an open shirt or what?

130
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:36,062
What's going on?
Why did you stop talking when I came in?

131
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:37,949
You were talking behind my back,
weren't you?

132
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,891
No, we were saying that
this shirt is really nice.

133
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,379
That's right.

134
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:48,721
Doo Shik looks much more handsome
because of that shirt.

135
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:50,865
Really? You like it that much?

136
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:52,783
- Huh?
- Hm?

137
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,392
You guys deserve it
after making fun of me.

138
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:58,406
Shut up.

139
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:00,690
What the heck is this?

140
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,242
You all look like three very
cold bums and it looks good.

141
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,303
- Right, Yoon Ah?
- Yes.

142
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:09,742
You look very cool and sexy, Dong Gu.

143
00:08:09,742 --> 00:08:12,692
Not you too, Yoon Ah.
This is embarrassing.

144
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,262
What is this?

145
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:17,100
Why is Su Ah suddenly designing clothes?

146
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,201
I don't know, but she's passionate
about it so I can't say it's weird.

147
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,771
I'm going insane.

148
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:25,451
Still, what's with this shirt?

149
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,726
Right, Yoon Ah?

150
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:30,588
Yes, it is a bit shocking.

151
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,246
What are you all doing here?

152
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,366
What's going on?
What's with the mood in here?

153
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,754
You were talking about me again,
weren't you?

154
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:44,318
No, we were complimenting
the shirt that you designed.

155
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:47,294
That's right. How could it be so trendy?

156
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,649
It's so nice.

157
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,269
Really? You like it that much?

158
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:59,145
What is this? The sleeves are...

159
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:00,913
so long.

160
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:06,225
Ah, this is the Soorgio Armhany
2018 S/S Cutie Collection.

161
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,926
It's called Bongsan No 5.

162
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:11,621
I got my inspiration from
the traditional Bongsan masked dancers.

163
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,995
Is that right?

164
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:17,586
But, aren't they sleeves just too long?

165
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:20,715
Hey, that's the whole point.

166
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:23,975
Normal hoodies are
too average and boring.

167
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:29,133
So, I made the sleeves dramatically
longer and emphasized the cuteness.

168
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,815
What do you think?
Isn't it totally cute?

169
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:34,732
Yes, it is cute. Thank you, Su Ah.

170
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:35,825
No need to thank me.

171
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,195
But you have to wear it often
and promote the clothes for me.

172
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,929
- All right?
- Okay.

173
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:42,198
Okay.

174
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,803
- Yeah.
- Of course.

175
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:47,934
Hello? Yes, Chairman.

176
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:51,482
What? You want me to do it?

177
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:55,225
Ah, yes. I understand.

178
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,812
What was that call about?

179
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,748
It was the agency chairman.

180
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,307
Choi Min Shik was supposed to throw
the first pitch at a baseball game.

181
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:03,215
But he can't because of a bad cold.

182
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:06,399
So, he wants me to do it instead.

183
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,216
Really?

184
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,644
You're throwing the first pitch?

185
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:11,961
- For a pro baseball game, at that?
- Yes.

186
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,669
Oh, congratulations!

187
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,811
Only really famous people get to do that.

188
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:19,620
Yeah, I guess I get to do this stuff
now that I have an agency.

189
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,864
A first pitch.

190
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:24,860
- Awesome.
- Congratulations.

191
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,909
<i>Next, we will look at previous
first pitches that got attention.</i>

192
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,821
Clara's first pitch in leggings.

193
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,841
The 360-degree first pitch.

194
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:34,623
Shin Soo Ji's first pitch
got a great deal of attention.

195
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,442
After these shocking first pitches,
interest in them increased by 13 times.

196
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:42,438
Recognition of them went up by 20 times.

197
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,923
Oh, really?

198
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:47,913
<i>Why are we having a meeting
over a first pitch?</i>

199
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,464
<i>A big management company
sure is different.</i>

200
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:54,221
A first pitch that is shocking and fresh.

201
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,302
What could there be?

202
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:58,813
Lee Joon Ki is playing an anchor
in his current drama.

203
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:02,134
Son Suk Hee.
He should dress up like him.

204
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:04,638
Then throw a ball in the shape of a mic.
What do you think?

205
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:07,910
Ah, that's not so great.
Anyone else?

206
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,941
Nothing?

207
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:13,840
There are so many of you.
Why are there no ideas?

208
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:19,932
Hi, Honey.

209
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:21,275
What?

210
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,633
You want to learn pole dancing?

211
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:27,693
Of course. You should do it
if you want to learn.

212
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,995
Yes, yes.

213
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:35,116
Wait... pole dancing.

214
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:46,825
So... you want me
to practice pole dancing on this?

215
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:50,260
The chairman said it cannot leak
to the media beforehand.

216
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,450
We must keep it secure.

217
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,118
Isn't pole dancing kind of wrong?

218
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:57,408
How can I throw a first pitch while
pole dancing? Does it make sense?

219
00:11:57,408 --> 00:12:00,350
What can we do?
It's the chairman's idea.

220
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,482
I'm seriously going crazy.

221
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:04,533
Should we start practicing, then?

222
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,741
I'll show you how it's done first,
so pay attention and copy me.

223
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,144
Okay.

224
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:19,797
What do you think? Easy, right?

225
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:21,936
I don't think it's possible for me.

226
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:24,136
- I'll be going now.
- No, no.

227
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:26,946
You can learn quickly once you practice.

228
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,633
First, practice hanging on to the pole.

229
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,644
Hang... hanging on?

230
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:39,422
Don't give up like that.
Use the muscles in your arms!

231
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:43,438
Oh, that burns.

232
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:44,708
Again.

233
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:47,522
Again.

234
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:51,344
Now! Oh, Teacher.
Teacher, please save me!

235
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:54,945
Teacher, please save me!

236
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:56,857
Oh, my back.

237
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:01,936
I wrestled with that pole all day
and my entire body hurts.

238
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:03,755
Do you really have to do this?

239
00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:06,696
What can I do when
it's the chairman's idea?

240
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:08,697
I'm just worried that you'll get hurt.

241
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:12,442
It's okay. It's still a good opportunity.

242
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:17,576
I'm going to work hard
and make sure to succeed.

243
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:21,736
And then I'm going to give you
everything you want, Bacca.

244
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:25,489
Gosh, I'm so happy that I'm about to cry.

245
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,506
Bacca, I don't think
this patch is going to be enough.

246
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:33,809
- I think I need something else.
- What?

247
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:37,736
Gosh, what's with you?

248
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:39,629
Why are you hitting me?

249
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:42,058
Hit me with your lips
if you're going to hit me.

250
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:43,946
Forget it.

251
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:47,066
- What do you mean?
- Oh, forget it.

252
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,309
Why are the orders slowing down lately?

253
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:55,759
Look at that.
I knew no one would order that.

254
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,429
I'm just worried someone I know
might see me in this.

255
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,392
I'd better talk to Su Ah
and tell her to take this picture down.

256
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:06,498
Su Ah, you know...

257
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,086
Wow, I guess she's
pretty serious about it.

258
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,116
Why is she sleeping like this?

259
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,759
Oh, it stinks. What did she eat?

260
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:26,118
What's going on?

261
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,605
Oh, what are you doing here, Doo Shik?

262
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:32,201
I'm just here. Why?

263
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,687
Why are you laughing?

264
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,471
You know what?

265
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:41,893
I just had a dream that I farted.

266
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:46,403
It was so real, like I actually farted.

267
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,061
I'm sure it did seem real.

268
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,575
It had to seem real.

269
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:55,413
Ah, Director Bong, has anyone
ordered the clothes I've designed?

270
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:58,096
Oh, no. Not yet.

271
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,350
Really?

272
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:04,826
Why isn't anyone buying them?
Are my designs not that great?

273
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,501
It's probably due to lack of marketing.

274
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:11,541
- Stay strong.
- You must be right.

275
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,897
Then will it work if I market them?

276
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:16,524
Ah, I can do that.

277
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:26,783
- Look at that.
- Look.

278
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:30,518
Hello, this is the newest product from
Soorgio Armhany, the Ultra V-neck.

279
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:32,532
Come and take a look.

280
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,053
Please take a look. Isn't it nice?

281
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:37,625
Wow, it's so nice and sexy.

282
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,365
Ladies, please take a look.

283
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,821
Come and take a look.

284
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:46,259
Hey.

285
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:50,611
Thank you. We are Soorgio Armhany.

286
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:53,725
<i>Min Su Ah, you're really too much.</i>

287
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:55,409
<i>You're going too far.</i>

288
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,712
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

289
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,351
Wow, you're pretty good now.

290
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:11,076
Right? I practiced all night
and now I can do it.

291
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:15,105
I just don't know if I can do it
while throwing a ball.

292
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:17,272
Then, should I help you?

293
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:19,273
- I'm off from work today.
- Really?

294
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:21,956
I would be so grateful.

295
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:24,323
Angel!

296
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:28,921
- Let's go have fun on the playground.
- Okay.

297
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:31,428
Let go!

298
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,620
<i>Let go!</i>

299
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,904
<i>Let go!</i>

300
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,844
Tae Rin, let's go to
a different playground.

301
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:57,013
- Joon Ki.
- Yeah?

302
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:59,076
Should we get started?

303
00:17:00,038 --> 00:17:01,778
Will you really be okay?

304
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:03,519
You've never played baseball.

305
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,498
Don't worry. I'll get the hang of it.

306
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:06,894
Throw it.

307
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:09,814
Okay, then I'm really going to throw it.

308
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,000
Let go!

309
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,544
Oh, Seo Jin!

310
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:20,029
Seo Jin, are you okay?

311
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,481
I'm fine, I'm fine. Try again.

312
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:26,759
Then, I'll try again.

313
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,417
I'm sorry.

314
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,701
Let go!

315
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,239
Let go! Let go!

316
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:36,661
Joon Ki, wait.

317
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:43,057
- Sorry!
- You're doing well.

318
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,897
Let go!

319
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:54,423
Let go!

320
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:14,131
Designing isn't easy.

321
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:21,276
How long do we have to wear this?

322
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:22,987
I'm dying of embarrassment.

323
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:26,394
Don't make it obvious in front of Su Ah.
She's making an effort.

324
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:28,049
Still, this isn't right.

325
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,509
Who would buy these crappy clothes?
Don't you agree?

326
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:36,066
It might be better for Su Ah
to tell her now and get her to quit.

327
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:39,006
Why do you accept this?
My goodness...

328
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:41,746
- Oh no!
- Su Ah...

329
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,367
So that's how it was.

330
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,513
That's what it was.

331
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:48,359
- Su Ah, it's not like that.
- I'm sorry.

332
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,772
I forced you to wear crappy clothes.

333
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,775
Su Ah, I didn't mean that.

334
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:55,902
- Su Ah.
- Su Ah, it's not that...

335
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,479
- Su Ah.
- Su Ah.

336
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:02,354
Su Ah, I'm sorry.

337
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:05,134
I didn't mean that you had no skills.

338
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,884
It's just that your clothes
are so dramatic.

339
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:10,573
I'm not very good at making it look good.

340
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:12,490
Yes, your clothes are nice.

341
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,446
We have bad bodies,
so this doesn't suit us.

342
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,502
Forget it. You guys are right.

343
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,999
How can I be a designer?

344
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,843
Oh, what is that sound?

345
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:23,173
I guess I have an order.

346
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,154
That's good.

347
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,935
- Oh!
- What is it?

348
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:29,486
Look at this.

349
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:31,596
Someone ordered my V-neck knit.

350
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,652
- Five of them.
- Hm? Five?

351
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:36,844
Oh, someone ordered the hoodie too!

352
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,170
So, people do buy those.

353
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,050
See? I told you dramatic clothes
are trendy lately.

354
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,795
You don't know fashion at all.
What a joke.

355
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:51,694
Sorry, I don't have a
good eye for things.

356
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:56,602
Yeah, we didn't even know that it
was an honor to wear these cool clothes.

357
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,917
You think so? I do have
something new that I designed.

358
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:02,999
You want it?

359
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,612
- What?
- What?

360
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,344
- Su Ah.
- Hm?

361
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,924
What kind of pants are these?

362
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:19,134
Ah, these are from the Soorgio Armhany
2018 S/S Sexy Collection.

363
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,012
They are the Ultra Fire pants.

364
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:25,173
I emphasized sexiness by
making shorts dramatically shorter.

365
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:27,443
- What do you think?
- They're not bad.

366
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:31,752
They're sexy, very refreshing to wear,
and embarrassing...

367
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:36,544
Su Ah, aren't they
a bit too short though?

368
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:39,432
Hey, that's the whole point.

369
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:42,550
Anyway, it's my special gift to you.

370
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,041
You have to wear them every day
and promote them for me, okay?

371
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,980
- Okay.
- Of course, I will.

372
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,704
It looks really good.

373
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:58,413
Joon Ki, you can do well
on your first pitch, right?

374
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:01,833
Of course, my Bacca helped me so much.

375
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,792
I will definitely do well.

376
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:08,262
If you were there to cheer me on,
I could do better.

377
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:11,105
Sorry, I'm doing an story today.

378
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,854
It's okay. You have work.

379
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,333
To make up for it...

380
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:17,848
Ta-da!

381
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:20,315
What's with the mustache?

382
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:23,422
It's a lucky charm. Give me your arm.

383
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:25,194
Even if I'm not with you

384
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:27,871
look at this and
always know I'm with you.

385
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,325
Okay?

386
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:30,491
Thank you.

387
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:32,295
You know I'm your number one fan, right?

388
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:35,214
Don't forget that I'm always with you
and rooting for you.

389
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:36,346
Okay.

390
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:39,747
Also, I have one more gift.

391
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:40,998
What is it?

392
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,748
Good luck, Joon Ki. I'll get going now.

393
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:48,446
Good luck!

394
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:51,298
Bye. Good luck!

395
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:59,510
Gosh, seriously.

396
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,528
I have to go to the office.

397
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,760
How am I supposed
to go looking like this?

398
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,010
This won't do.

399
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,894
I'd better change and
climb out the window.

400
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:12,174
Director Bong,
may I borrow your laptop...

401
00:22:14,105 --> 00:22:15,672
What are you doing?

402
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:19,311
You're not changing
out of those clothes, are you?

403
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:22,628
No, I was putting it on.

404
00:22:22,628 --> 00:22:25,801
I like it so much.

405
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,767
Really? Where's Doo Shik?

406
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,507
He stepped out for a moment
to meet a friend outside.

407
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,211
Gosh. Yes, Director.

408
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:38,632
Yes, I'm going right now... right now.

409
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:42,234
I'll be there soon. Yes. I'm sorry.

410
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:44,182
Are you going to the office?
Get there safely.

411
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:45,799
Yes, okay.

412
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,288
Get going and
promote the clothes for me.

413
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:51,663
Okay.

414
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:56,634
- I need something from my bag.
- Oh.

415
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:58,233
Bye!

416
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:01,763
Ah, where is that laptop?

417
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:19,228
What is this?

418
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:25,762
Here are the clothes you asked for.

419
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:28,463
Yes. Thanks.

420
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:32,657
What is Soorgio Armhany that
you keep asking me to order for you?

421
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:34,667
Ah, it's just something.

422
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,641
Sorry for bothering you with it.

423
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:40,698
What is with your outfit?
Is it underwear? How embarrassing.

424
00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:43,489
Everyone is staring at you.

425
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,393
What? It's nice!

426
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:48,230
It's the trend these days to wear
dramatic clothes like this.

427
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,546
Hey... do you want one too?

428
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:54,590
Try it on and if you like it,
recommend it to other people.

429
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,054
Try it on. Do I embarrass you?

430
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,094
- Try it on.
- Please stop!

431
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:01,073
Put that away!

432
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,967
<i>You can start over now.</i>

433
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:18,936
<i>You can start looking now for
what will make you happy forever.</i>

434
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,247
<i>Do you think I can do it too?</i>

435
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:22,843
<i>I'll help you study.
You can do it, Su Ah.</i>

436
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:23,961
I can do it!

437
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:27,613
<i>I'm going to open up
an internet shopping mall.</i>

438
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:29,431
Armhany!

439
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:33,115
<i>Shopping mall, Soorgio Armhany.</i>

440
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:36,317
How can the director go home when
the president is out here like this?

441
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:05,862
- Su Ah, what are you doing here?
- Huh?

442
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:07,071
Nothing. I'm just here.

443
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:08,354
Why are you getting annoyed?

444
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:12,891
I just borrowed a game from my friend.
You want to bet who cooks ramen on it?

445
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:16,326
No, I'm tired and
I want to rest, you pig!

446
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:17,652
What?

447
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:21,374
Pig? What's that all about?

448
00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:23,124
What a psycho.

449
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:26,839
Did you practice a lot?

450
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,778
Yes, I did my best.

451
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:32,826
Good. I'm telling you that you'll
gain popularity once you do this.

452
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:34,906
- So, do a good job.
- Yes, Chairman.

453
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:36,884
- What about his clothes?
- Ah, yes.

454
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:38,470
Here you go.

455
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:42,759
What? Why... why is this here?

456
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,375
Oh, I like it.
It's perfect for pole dancing.

457
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,348
Where did you buy this?

458
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:51,779
There's a very hot shopping mall
among the stylists lately.

459
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,375
- It's called Soorgio Armhany Mall.
- What?

460
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:56,578
- Soorgio Armhany is hot?
- Yes.

461
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:59,643
The president of it
has released her own brand too.

462
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,039
The designs are awesome.

463
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,950
Isn't it really dramatic and sexy?

464
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,255
Yes, well...

465
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:09,563
Good job on the interview.

466
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:14,030
We're done with our work now.
Shall we go eat something good?

467
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,490
Pardon me? Oh, Senior...

468
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,882
If you have nothing for me to do,
may I leave now?

469
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:22,214
I have something I need to do.

470
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,359
Well, sure.

471
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,737
Thank you, Senior.
I'll see you tomorrow.

472
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,997
Goodbye.

473
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:37,041
Lee Joon Ki, you showed us
a dramatic pole dance first pitch.

474
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:39,575
The reaction is already extraordinary.

475
00:26:39,575 --> 00:26:41,817
Where did you get such an idea?

476
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:45,599
Yes, the idea came from
the chairman of my agency.

477
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,489
I also received help from many others,
so I was able to complete it very well.

478
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,529
Kang Seo Jin.

479
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:58,329
- Hello, Senior.
- What brings you here?

480
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:01,499
I just happened to be passing by.

481
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:05,608
- Ah...
- Didn't you find pole dancing difficult?

482
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:09,461
Of course, it was difficult,
but many people helped me.

483
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,710
There was someone who helped me
every day and caught balls for me.

484
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,471
I want to use this time to tell
that person how thankful I am.

485
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,176
By any chance,
is that person your girlfriend?

486
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:24,670
- It's a girlfriend, right?
- What?

487
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,880
Girlfriend?

488
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,411
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

489
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:41,310
Is that right?
Then what is your ideal type?

490
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,278
I'm not sure.

491
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:44,739
Uh...

492
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:47,345
Please support pole dancing, everyone!

493
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:52,710
<i>Wow.</i>

494
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,494
Joon Ki is still trending at number one.

495
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:57,415
Number two is pole dance first pitch.

496
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:59,124
Number three is "Dong Doon Deok."

497
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,915
Wow, you're totally popular now.

498
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:04,115
I guess the pole dance first pitch
actually works.

499
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:07,602
I never imagined that the reaction
would be this good either.

500
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,476
The world is a funny place.

501
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:15,474
But there is something bothering me.

502
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:18,746
- What?
- What do you mean, no girlfriend?

503
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:19,997
Why would you say something

504
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:22,321
that would lead to you
smelling incense at your funeral?

505
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:24,517
Well, that...

506
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:28,511
the chairman told me never
to reveal that I have a girlfriend.

507
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:31,542
He was so firm on it
that I couldn't do anything.

508
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:34,020
Seo Jin, I'm so sorry.

509
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,999
I should've told you earlier.

510
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,711
No, it's okay.

511
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:40,326
You have no choice.

512
00:28:40,326 --> 00:28:42,259
Thanks for understanding.

513
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,784
Joon Ki, why are you
wearing these clothes?

514
00:28:45,784 --> 00:28:47,150
Aren't these Su Ah's clothes?

515
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,920
My stylist bought these.

516
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,269
Apparently, her mall is
very hot among stylists.

517
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,463
Really?

518
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:57,695
Yes, our Su Ah is...

519
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:06,994
Joon Ki, I saw the first pitch you did
a few days ago.

520
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:08,893
You got a great reaction.

521
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:11,453
- Thank you.
- I'm the one who's thankful.

522
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:13,785
It helped to promote our drama.

523
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,037
Oh yeah. Did you read the script?

524

00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:09,784
Dot Copy, wow.

702
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:12,813
There he is. Hello.

703
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,407
What up?

704
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:18,389
Long time, no see.

705
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,668
Ah, who is this?

706
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:24,806
This here is Kang Dong Gu.
He's one of my assistant directors.

707
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:26,925
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

708
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,362
Give him a fist bump.

709
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:30,577
Yes.

710
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:32,557
Nice to meet you.

711
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:33,932
Okay. Let's get it.

712
00:39:33,932 --> 00:39:36,021
So, how is the work on the music going?

713
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:38,242
It's going all right.

714
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:41,541
You said it's a spy film in Dubai.

715
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:44,590
I made a few samples
to match the concept.

716
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,152
Would you like to hear it?

717
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:48,273
- Let's do that.
- Okay. Let's get it.

718
00:39:55,242 --> 00:39:58,016
Yeah. Let's get it.

719
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:19,934
What do you think?

720
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:24,230
Isn't this PSY's "Champion" though?

721
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,483
It sounds the same except for the lyrics.

722
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:28,798
What the f...

723
00:40:28,798 --> 00:40:29,981
What did you say?

724
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:32,478
Are you saying I plagiarized or what?

725
00:40:32,478 --> 00:40:36,246
No, it's just so similar.

726
00:40:36,246 --> 00:40:37,438
Oh my god.

727
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:41,190
Does it sound like PSY's "Champion"
to you too, Director?

728
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,349
Sounds completely different to me.

729
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:47,335
He doesn't know music very well.
Don't worry about it.

730
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:50,958
- I'll turn on the next one then.
- Okay.

731
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,541
What's wrong with
your facial expression again?

732
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,670
Well, this one...

733
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,315
It sounds like BIGBANG's "Lies."

734
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:26,380
What are you talking about?
It's totally different. What's with you?

735
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,903
Well, the rhythm is similar.

736
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,233
Ah, he's pickier than I thought.

737
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:34,670
All right. This time, it's something
you have never heard before.

738
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,481
I took traditional rap and changed it.

739
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:40,715
I'll turn it on for you.
Let's get it.

740
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,865
What? Do you feel like
you've heard this before too?

741
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,721
No. No, I haven't.

742
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:10,420
It's new and fresh.

743
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,755
Yes, I like it.

744
00:42:12,755 --> 00:42:14,235
Let's go with this one.

745
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:18,282
- Okay. Let's get it.
- Get it.

746
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:22,492
I'll work on it some more
and we can talk about after.

747
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,835
<i>Dubai...</i>

748
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:29,077
I've already memorized it.

749
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:35,117
This time, Hae Na suddenly
shows up at Joon Seok's house.

750
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:40,913
Hae Na looks upon Joon Seok with
dewy eyes and suddenly kisses him.

751
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:42,556
- Understand?
- Yes.

752
00:42:42,556 --> 00:42:46,427
- Let's start now. Make it real.
- Okay.

753
00:42:46,427 --> 00:42:48,228
Let's get started!

754
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:51,467
And... action!

755
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,681
<i>Who is it?</i>

756
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:57,217
Hae Na? What is it?

757
00:42:57,217 --> 00:42:58,480
Senior.

758
00:42:59,498 --> 00:43:01,342
Come in. Come in and let's talk.

759
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:11,338
Ow!

760
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,625
Cut!

761
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:13,806
Are you okay?

762
00:43:13,806 --> 00:43:15,398
What are you doing?

763
00:43:15,398 --> 00:43:16,666
Sorry, Director.

764
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:19,713
- Are you okay, Joon Ki?
- Yes, I'm fine.

765
00:43:25,661 --> 00:43:27,601
<i>Cindy? What is that?</i>

766
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:29,139
<i>Cindy?</i>

767
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,210
<i>No way.</i>

768
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,360
Let's start with the kiss, then.

769
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,769
Yes, all right.

770
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:37,958
And... action!

771
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:43,909
- Ow!
- Are you all right?

772
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:45,230
What's going on, huh?

773
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,250
Joon Ki. Joon Ki, are you okay?

774
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,255
- Huh?
- Yes, yes.

775
00:43:49,255 --> 00:43:52,902
You all had better focus.
What's with all of you today?

776
00:43:52,902 --> 00:43:54,840
Why is this suddenly acting up?

777
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,525
Joon Ki, I'm sorry.

778
00:43:56,525 --> 00:43:58,909
Yes, it's okay.

779
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:02,523
<i>Huh?</i>

780
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:04,465
<i>[My love, Cindy]
Cindy?</i>

781
00:44:04,465 --> 00:44:07,813
<i>What? Then, this person too?</i>

782
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,117
Are you okay?

783
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,887
Ah, yes. I'm okay.

784
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:16,818
Let's rest for a bit
until the lighting is set again.

785
00:44:16,818 --> 00:44:18,911
- Joon Ki, rest.
- Okay.

786
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:25,842
I have a bad feeling,
a bad feeling, such a bad feeling.

787
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:27,693
Joon Ki, are you all right?

788
00:44:27,693 --> 00:44:28,987
Something is weird.

789
00:44:28,987 --> 00:44:32,572
I think the sound and lighting crew
are all Cindy fans.

790
00:44:32,572 --> 00:44:34,023
You're still going on about that?

791
00:44:34,023 --> 00:44:36,619
It's true. There's something there.

792
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:39,134
Calm down and drink this.

793
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:41,184
Thanks.

794
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:49,293
Why does it taste like this?

795
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:56,199
Hey, this expired over a year ago!

796
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:58,820
It did? I'm sorry.

797
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,481
I just bought it at the store.

798
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,523
Ah, just forget it.

799
00:45:02,523 --> 00:45:05,664
Oh yeah. I don't have anything
scheduled on Sunday, right?

800
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:07,706
I have a very important engagement.

801
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,637
- Sunday? Hold on.
- Yeah.

802
00:45:10,637 --> 00:45:13,146
Sunday, Sunday...

803
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,570
<i>[My love, Cindy]
Cindy!</i>

804
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,860
<i>Even my manager? You too?</i>

805
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,976
What's wrong?

806
00:45:20,976 --> 00:45:23,550
It's... it's nothing.

807
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,094
Are you okay? Should I bring you
coffee to get you more alert?

808
00:45:26,094 --> 00:45:28,472
I won't drink it! I will never drink it!

809
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:29,896
Why are you getting angry?

810
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,239
Joon Ki!

811
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:47,679
This is it right here.

812
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,661
Park Seo Joon is my type.

813
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:54,534
Doo Shik isn't. How dare he?

814
00:45:55,898 --> 00:45:58,233
You're good looking.

815
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:12,670
What's wrong with me?

816
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,878
Oh no. I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

817
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:17,885
Min Su Ah, you're definitely crazy.

818
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:20,599
What are you doing?

819
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,103
What is it to you
what I'm doing, you pig?

820
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:27,168
She's calling me a pig again. Hey!

821
00:46:27,168 --> 00:46:29,869
Why am I a pig again?
You stupid mutt!

822
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:32,463
That psycho girl.

823
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,278
Why do you look like that?

824
00:46:36,278 --> 00:46:39,074
Doo Shik, I'm so scared.

825
00:46:39,827 --> 00:46:41,820
That psycho girl.

826
00:46:44,686 --> 00:46:45,833
Why do you look like that?

827
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:48,134
Doo Shik, I'm so scared.

828
00:46:48,134 --> 00:46:50,320
Scared of what?

829
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,422
What? You think Cindy's fans
are terrorizing you?

830
00:46:54,422 --> 00:46:55,715
Yes.

831
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:58,614
Every time something strange happens,
it's caused by a Cindy fan.

832
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:00,788
I think her fans are retaliating

833
00:47:00,788 --> 00:47:03,155
because I have a love story
with her in the drama.

834
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:04,465
Does that make sense?

835
00:47:04,465 --> 00:47:05,835
You're just paranoid.

836
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:09,230
That's not true.
Something is going on.

837
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,300
Don't be like that.
Just go to your room and sleep.

838
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,650
You're just tired, Joon Ki.

839
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,309
- Really?
- Yes.

840
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:15,835
You think so?

841
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:19,731
- I'd get better with rest, right?
- Just go rest.

842
00:47:19,731 --> 00:47:20,969
Okay.

843
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:23,925
It's so dangerous.

844
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:27,206
It's so dangerous outside.
It's dangerous!

845
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:34,509
<i>[Lee Joon Ki, you are dead.
Cindy is mine.]</i>

846
00:47:34,509 --> 00:47:37,543
Joon Ki, what is it? What is it?

847
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:41,369
Look at this.
Cindy's fans sent me threats.

848
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:44,710
Her fans must have come into my room.

849
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:48,514
It's even dangerous under my blanket.
It's dangerous!

850
00:47:48,514 --> 00:47:51,307
Joon Ki, where are you going?
Where are you going?

851
00:47:51,307 --> 00:47:52,853
What's wrong with him?

852
00:47:58,135 --> 00:48:01,235
<i>[Get away from Cindy.
I'll kill you.]</i>

853
00:48:10,277 --> 00:48:13,923
<i>[My love, Cindy]</i>

854
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,197
What are you doing, Yoon Ah?

855
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:25,114
I bought your favorite,
blood sausages.

856
00:48:25,114 --> 00:48:26,614
Thank you.

857
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:35,130
Are you still down because of the exam?

858
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,666
No... you must be busy
because of your work.

859
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:42,057
Yes, we're going to Dubai in a week.

860
00:48:42,057 --> 00:48:43,568
I have so much to prepare.

861
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:46,762
- Did you say you'll be gone a month?
- Yes.

862
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,067
I'll miss you and Sol so much.
What should I do?

863
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:54,748
- Should I just stay?
- Oh, what are you saying?

864
00:48:54,748 --> 00:48:56,849
Take care of yourself
and have a good trip.

865
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:01,541
I'm just worried that I might end up
falling for some other woman.

866
00:49:05,847 --> 00:49:08,503
I was joking to make you laugh, Yoon Ah.

867
00:49:08,503 --> 00:49:09,702
Sorry.

868
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:14,606
Ah, I met someone really funny today.
Want to hear about him?

869
00:49:14,606 --> 00:49:16,067
Who did you meet?

870
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:19,018
I met the rapper who's doing
our movie's soundtrack.

871
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:22,768
But all of his songs
are songs I've heard before.

872
00:49:22,768 --> 00:49:25,958
PSY, BIGBANG, and iKON songs.

873
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:28,565
He just changes the lyrics
and the track is the same.

874
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,012
Oh, really?

875
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:32,235
What was he called again?

876
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,487
MC Dot Copy?

877
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:36,514
Ah, I guess that's why he's Dot Copy.

878
00:49:36,514 --> 00:49:40,309
- He copies all of his songs.
- MC Dot Copy?

879
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:42,221
What? Do you know him?

880
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:45,239
Of course. He's the rapper
I look up to the most.

881
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:49,876
Actually, I dreamed of being a rapper
because of Dot Copy.

882
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:53,847
- Really?
- It was my dream to meet Dot Copy.

883
00:49:53,847 --> 00:49:56,184
Then, should I introduce you to him?

884
00:49:56,184 --> 00:49:59,851
Really? I would love that.

885
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:02,193
Gosh, now you finally smile.

886
00:50:02,193 --> 00:50:03,621
Are you that happy?

887
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:05,873
Yes, I'm so happy.

888
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:08,577
Dong Gu, thank you. Thank you so much.

889
00:50:08,577 --> 00:50:10,222
Goodness.

890
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:13,873
What do I do?

891
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:17,179
- Hello.
- Hello.

892
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:19,489
Hello!

893
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:21,568
Are you here already, Senior?

894
00:50:21,568 --> 00:50:24,737
You must be tired.
Have some coffee.

895
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:26,681
Yes. Thank you.

896
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:46,059
Forget it. I don't want it.
I don't want it!

897
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:59,800
Senior, why are you eating alone?
Let's eat together.

898
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,998
Huh? No, I'm fine.

899
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:05,443
Senior, you have rice on your face.

900
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:26,847
Give it back.

901
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,445
I put it there to eat later
when I got hungry!

902
00:51:29,445 --> 00:51:30,887
Don't touch it!

903
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:48,025
You scared me!

904
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,934
Cindy...

905
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:51,735
You scared me.

906
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:56,050
- Are you mad at me about something?
- Huh?

907
00:51:56,804 --> 00:51:57,909
No, I'm not.

908
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:00,059
Then why do you keep avoiding me?

909
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,346
You don't talk to me or say hello.

910
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,460
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

911
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,891
- It's not that--
- Tell me if I did something wrong.

912
00:52:10,891 --> 00:52:13,900
I'll fix it, okay?

913
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:20,429
Are you crying right now?

914
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:24,994
So, to tell you the truth--

915
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:29,695
- What is it? What?
- My eyelash is in my eye.

916
00:52:29,695 --> 00:52:32,684
Really? Let me take a look.

917
00:52:32,684 --> 00:52:33,893
Here.

918
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:46,751
Finished.

919
00:52:46,751 --> 00:52:49,873
I updated all of our new products.
That was hard.

920
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:52,018
What is Su Ah doing?
Why do you always do it alone?

921
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:54,623
I don't know. She is the worst president.

922
00:52:54,623 --> 00:52:57,222
She never works
and calls me a pig for no reason.

923
00:52:57,222 --> 00:52:58,882
I think she's a psycho.

924
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:00,961
She was never normal to begin with.

925
00:53:00,961 --> 00:53:02,655
I guess so.

926
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:04,710
Well, I'm done with work.

927
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:09,244
Should I fabricate views for
"President is Bruce Lee"?

928
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:15,420
What's this? Lee Joon Ki
is trending number one.

929
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,161
It can't be the Lee Joon Ki
I know, right?

930
00:53:21,148 --> 00:53:22,215
What's this?

931
00:53:22,215 --> 00:53:26,288
"Cindy, Lee Joon Ki Dating.
Secret Date Location."

932
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:29,019
What? What do you mean by that?

933
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:30,108
I don't know...

934
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,715
What is this?

935
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:35,916
I don't really know either.

936
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:38,309
Hey, what's going on here?

937
00:53:40,103 --> 00:53:41,900
I'm home.

938
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,570
What are you guys doing?

939
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:46,054
Are you looking at something fun?
Let me see too.

940
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:49,146
Me too, me too. I want to see too.

941
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:52,811
What? Hey, what is this?

942
00:53:52,811 --> 00:53:54,802
What happened?

943
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:57,483
- You kissed Cindy?
- Huh?

944
00:53:57,483 --> 00:53:59,621
What do you mean, kissed her?

945
00:53:59,621 --> 00:54:01,721
No, that's not true at all.

946
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:04,672
- That's just a misunderstanding.
- What is this picture?

947
00:54:04,672 --> 00:54:09,501
Cindy had an eyelash in her eye and
I blew in her eye to get it out for her.

948
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:11,231
That's the truth!

949
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:13,815
Seo Jin, you believe me, right?

950
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:16,581
Ah, is that what happened?

951
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:18,552
I thought so.

952
00:54:18,552 --> 00:54:20,681
I'm going crazy.

953
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:22,577
What kind of punk wrote this?

954
00:54:22,577 --> 00:54:24,380
Seo Jin, don't worry.

955
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,226
- I'll put out a correction refuting it.
- Okay.

956
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,931
<i>[Chairman]</i>

957
00:54:45,304 --> 00:54:48,503
Chairman, have you seen the article?

958
00:54:48,503 --> 00:54:50,570
Yes, it's all a misunderstanding.

959
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,630
I'm not in any relationship with Cindy.

960
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,721
We should put out a statement
correcting it right away.

961
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:56,510
Why would we?

962
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,309
- Why do that? Leave it be.
- What?

963
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:01,639
- What do you mean?
- Joon Ki.

964
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:03,050
Who is Cindy?

965
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,601
She's the nation's little sister.

966
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:09,570
<i>If you get in a dating scandal with her,
people will know who are.</i>

967
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,929
<i>There's nothing bad about it.</i>

968
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,896
Yes, but still...

969
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:16,686
<i>Do as I say and stay quiet.</i>

970
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:20,211
I'll make an announcement
when the time comes, okay?

971
00:55:21,213 --> 00:55:22,672
Chairman, Chair...

972
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:26,909
Seriously, this is crazy.

973
00:55:30,114 --> 00:55:32,076
Wow, look at this.

974
00:55:32,076 --> 00:55:34,215
Joon Ki's still number one.

975
00:55:34,215 --> 00:55:36,612
It's spreading at a high rate.

976
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:39,306
What happened?

977
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:41,083
Are you putting out
an article to correct it?

978
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:45,255
Well, the chairman says to do nothing.

979
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:47,009
- What?
- Well...

980
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:51,516
He says it helps people know who I am
if I get in a dating scandal with Cindy.

981
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:54,382
He told me to do nothing.

982
00:55:55,065 --> 00:55:57,079
I'm really going insane.

983
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,206
Really? Well, what can you do, then?

984
00:56:02,206 --> 00:56:04,856
Joon Ki, I'm okay, so don't worry.

985
00:56:04,856 --> 00:56:07,456
Joon Ki, this is going too far.

986
00:56:07,456 --> 00:56:09,878
Do you think Seo Jin is like
Hong Gil Dong?

987
00:56:09,878 --> 00:56:12,268
She can't even call her boyfriend
her boyfriend.

988
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:15,356
She has to endure your dating scandal.
Isn't that too much?

989
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:18,547
Seo Jin... I'm sorry.

990
00:56:18,547 --> 00:56:19,739
I'm really sorry.

991
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:23,525
It's okay. It's not like
you did it on purpose.

992
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:27,494
Joon Ki, Cindy's fans
threw a fit over a hugging scene.

993
00:56:27,494 --> 00:56:31,744
Now you have dating scandal.
Won't you die if you go outside?

994
00:56:31,744 --> 00:56:34,445
You're right. I'm in big trouble.

995
00:56:34,445 --> 00:56:36,615
Seo Jin's birthday party is tomorrow.

996
00:56:36,615 --> 00:56:38,661
We can have the party at home.

997
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,304
No, I even made reservations already.

998
00:56:41,304 --> 00:56:44,954
Also, it's not just any day,
but your birthday.

999
00:56:44,954 --> 00:56:48,704
I'll do what I need to.
Let's go on that date tomorrow.

1000
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:50,061
All right?

1001
00:56:50,061 --> 00:56:51,981
Yeah, okay.

1002
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,730
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

1003
00:56:59,052 --> 00:57:00,831
Okay. Let's get it.

1004
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:04,692
Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much.

1005
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:06,561
Thank you for making the time.

1006
00:57:06,561 --> 00:57:08,204
You're welcome, you're welcome.

1007
00:57:08,204 --> 00:57:13,103
I didn't think that
your girlfriend would be my fan.

1008
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:15,673
I never imagined she would be either.

1009
00:57:15,673 --> 00:57:21,423
Actually, I dreamed of being a rapper
after listening to your music.

1010
00:57:21,423 --> 00:57:22,818
Though, I've given up on it now.

1011
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:26,407
Oh, really?
You dreamed of being a rapper.

1012
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:28,594
Let's get it.

1013
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:38,784
Okay, then why don't you record a
track while you're here, Yoon Ah?

1014
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,208
- Really?
- Of course. Give it a try.

1015
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:47,545
You can make memories and
it will be nice. Which song?

1016
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:51,728
Well, I really love your debut song,
"Mapo Bridge."

1017
00:57:51,728 --> 00:57:53,248
Can I try singing it?

1018
00:57:53,248 --> 00:57:55,829
Sure, why not.
Step inside and let's get it.

1019
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:56,873
Okay.

1020
00:58:01,518 --> 00:58:04,619
Yoon Ah, let's start.

1021
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,179
- Okay.
<i>- Don't be nervous.</i>

1022
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:08,233
Okay. Let's get it.

1023
00:58:14,217 --> 00:58:17,530
<i>What is this?
It's the same as Zion.T's "Yanghwa BRDG."</i>

1024
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,469
<i>Seriously, he is really something.
He really is.</i>

1025
00:58:29,762 --> 00:58:32,782
<i>I was always alone at home.</i>

1026
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:35,606
<i>My mother was a bus driver.</i>

1027
00:58:35,606 --> 00:58:40,297
<i>When I asked her where she was,
it was always Mapo Bridge.</i>

1028
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:45,547
<i>Let's be happy.
Let's be happy.</i>

1029
00:58:45,547 --> 00:58:50,311
<i>Do not be sad.</i>

1030
00:58:51,217 --> 00:58:52,597
Wait, wait.

1031
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:54,070
Yes, what is it?

1032
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:58,588
The way you're singing right now
is the way Zion.T sings.

1033
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:01,815
<i>I think you're getting confused with
Zion.T's "Yanghwa BRDG" right now.</i>

1034
00:59:01,815 --> 00:59:05,784
This is my song "Mapo Bridge,"
not Yanghwa.

1035
00:59:05,784 --> 00:59:08,885
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yes. Sorry.

1036
00:59:08,885 --> 00:59:12,306
Do not sing it like Zion.T, all right?

1037
00:59:12,306 --> 00:59:15,356
- Okay.
<i>- Let's try again. Let's get it.</i>

1038
00:59:27,112 --> 00:59:30,150
<i>I was always alone at home.</i>

1039
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,813
<i>My mother was a bus driver.</i>

1040
00:59:32,813 --> 00:59:37,543
<i>When I asked her where she was,
it was always Mapo Bridge.</i>

1041
00:59:37,543 --> 00:59:40,110
<i>Let's be happy.</i>

1042
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,262
Stop it. Stop it.

1043
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:45,126
<i>Yoon Ah, you sound like Zion.T again.</i>

1044
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:49,967
They are two different songs.
Why do keep confusing the two?

1045
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:54,717
Yanghwa Bridge and Mapo Bridge
are one kilometer apart.

1046
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:58,490
There's even Seogang Bridge in between.
Yet, you're confused?

1047
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:03,967
Let's be, I mean...

1048
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:08,833
<i>Let's be happy.</i>

1049
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:11,257
Is that so hard to do?

1050
01:00:11,257 --> 01:00:12,820
Sorry.

1051
01:00:14,896 --> 01:00:18,403
- Let's try one last time.
- Okay.

1052
01:00:26,353 --> 01:00:28,635
Wow, Bacca.

1053
01:00:28,635 --> 01:00:32,248
- You look so pretty today.
- Really?

1054
01:00:32,248 --> 01:00:34,717
We haven't been on a date in so long,
so I made an effort.

1055
01:00:34,717 --> 01:00:37,719
- Do I look okay?
- Yes, you look so pretty.

1056
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:40,416
- Should we get going?
- Yes.

1057
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:42,561
Oh yeah. Hold on.

1058
01:00:45,536 --> 01:00:46,570
What are you doing?

1059
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,311
Just in case I get seen by reporters

1060
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:52,152
the chairman said
I had to go out like this.

1061
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:53,190
Oh yeah?

1062
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,804
Okay, then. Let's go!

1063
01:00:55,804 --> 01:00:57,382
Let's go!

1064
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,360
Welcome.

1065
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,257
Do you have a reservation?

1066
01:01:07,822 --> 01:01:10,342
- Chewbacca.
- This way.

1067
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:15,315
Here.

1068
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,211
Wait, wait.

1069
01:01:22,396 --> 01:01:24,338
The chair is coming in.

1070
01:01:31,615 --> 01:01:32,728
Thank you.

1071
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:35,739
But... are you going to keep that on?

1072
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:37,726
Huh? What?

1073
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:40,193
Oh, I'll take it off.

1074
01:01:40,193 --> 01:01:42,083
Oh my.

1075
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:44,222
Here, Seo Jin. Order your food.

1076
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:47,038
I'll buy you whatever you want today.

1077
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:49,623
Really? I'm so excited.

1078
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,556
What should I eat?

1079
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:54,208
Yes, Editor. I just arrived.

1080
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:56,398
Yes, I just finished.

1081
01:01:56,398 --> 01:01:59,115
Yes, which room is it?

1082
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,447
The one on the right? Okay.

1083
01:02:02,447 --> 01:02:05,728
Oh, sorry. I got the wrong room.

1084
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:07,012
Yes.

1085
01:02:20,998 --> 01:02:23,436
Sirloin or tenderloin?

1086
01:02:23,436 --> 01:02:26,494
Seo Jin, choose what you want.
I'm going to the restroom.

1087
01:02:26,494 --> 01:02:28,588
Okay. Go on.

1088
01:02:28,588 --> 01:02:30,407
Sirloin?

1089
01:02:43,148 --> 01:02:44,708
Excuse me.

1090
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:47,188
You're Lee Joon Ki, right?

1091
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:49,579
No, you have the wrong person.

1092
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:53,507
You are Lee Joon Ki.
I saw you in the room earlier.

1093
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:57,237
Joon Ki, please give me one comment
on your dating scandal with Cindy.

1094
01:02:57,237 --> 01:02:58,307
Do you admit it's true?

1095
01:02:58,307 --> 01:02:59,632
I'm not Lee Joon Ki.

1096
01:02:59,632 --> 01:03:03,481
If you're not him,
then take your mask off for me.

1097
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:05,331
I'll let you go if you're not him.

1098
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:07,260
- Just wait a minute.
- Geez.

1099
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,784
Lee Joon Ki! You're Lee Joon Ki, right?

1100
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:12,452
Lee Joon Ki, one comment!

1101
01:03:17,331 --> 01:03:20,543
Gosh. Why isn't Joon Ki coming back?

1102
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:21,773
<i>[Joon Ki]</i>

1103
01:03:21,773 --> 01:03:24,483
Hm, it's Joon Ki.

1104
01:03:24,483 --> 01:03:26,036
What's going on?

1105
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:29,512
Joon Ki, why aren't you coming back?

1106
01:03:29,512 --> 01:03:32,623
Seo Jin, I'm being chased by a reporter.

1107
01:03:32,623 --> 01:03:35,983
So, I don't think I can go back
into the restaurant. What should I do?

1108
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:39,166
- What?
- <i>I'm really sorry.</i>

1109
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:43,119
She followed me again.

1110
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,086
I'll see you at home. I'm sorry.

1111
01:04:21,737 --> 01:04:23,791
Seo Jin, you're just getting home?

1112
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:26,128
I'm really sorry about before.

1113
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,949
The reporter was
waiting for me in the hallway.

1114
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:34,005
She kept asking if the dating scandal
was true, so I had to run away.

1115
01:04:34,005 --> 01:04:36,739
I'm really sorry, okay?

1116
01:04:38,557 --> 01:04:42,534
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

1117
01:04:46,266 --> 01:04:49,757
- Joon Ki, I have something to say.
- Something to say?

1118
01:04:49,757 --> 01:04:51,239
What is it?

1119
01:04:52,108 --> 01:04:54,780
Let's take some time to think.

1120
01:04:55,463 --> 01:04:56,934
What?

1121
01:04:58,016 --> 01:05:01,175
What do you mean, time to think?

1122
01:05:01,914 --> 01:05:03,994
What does that mean?

1123
01:05:03,994 --> 01:05:05,929
Just...

1124
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:10,134
Let's rethink our relationship.

1125
01:05:11,092 --> 01:05:12,400
Huh?

1126
01:05:14,835 --> 01:05:17,255
I don't understand that guy.

1127
01:05:17,255 --> 01:05:20,193
Yanghwa Bridge and Mapo Bridge
sound the same to me.

1128
01:05:20,193 --> 01:05:24,565
He copied all the songs and made
them the same, so why pick on you?

1129
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:29,914
Yoon Ah, don't be upset.
He's the strange one.

1130
01:05:29,914 --> 01:05:32,344
No, I'm fine.

1131
01:05:32,344 --> 01:05:35,452
I already gave up on rapping anyway.

1132
01:05:37,965 --> 01:05:40,047
But, Dong Gu...

1133
01:05:41,485 --> 01:05:44,614
why is it that
I'm not good at anything?

1134
01:05:44,614 --> 01:05:48,516
Both baking and rapping...

1135
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:52,625
Why do you keep
thinking about things negatively?

1136
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,692
I'm sorry.

1137
01:05:54,692 --> 01:05:58,596
I know you're trying hard
to make me feel better.

1138
01:05:58,596 --> 01:06:00,619
I just don't feel better.

1139
01:06:02,885 --> 01:06:05,590
This woman... This just won't do.

1140
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:09,880
Yoon Ah, I've prepared something for you.

1141
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,463
What is it?

1142
01:06:13,494 --> 01:06:16,608
Yeah. Get it.

1143
01:06:16,608 --> 01:06:19,135
<i>The wound of the exam
is deep in your heart.</i>

1144
01:06:19,135 --> 01:06:23,039
<i>You have tears, but you shouldn't cry,
no matter how sad and lonely.</i>

1145
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,842
<i>That is Yoon Ah.</i>

1146
01:06:24,842 --> 01:06:27,708
Dong Gu, what... what are you doing?

1147
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,813
<i>Look into my eyes... lesson.</i>

1148
01:06:29,813 --> 01:06:33,653
<i>Forget about Dot Copy.
Erase him from your mind and run.</i>

1149
01:06:33,653 --> 01:06:37,106
<i>Run toward your dream.
Just go. Where?</i>

1150
01:06:38,641 --> 01:06:40,603
Ah, wait. I'll do it again.

1151
01:06:40,603 --> 01:06:42,407
<i>Just go...</i>

1152
01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:46,987
Yoon Ah, you're laughing.

1153
01:06:46,987 --> 01:06:48,865
You feel better, right?

1154
01:06:50,246 --> 01:06:54,030
Wow, it's really hard
to make you feel better.

1155
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:55,487
How embarrassing.

1156
01:06:55,487 --> 01:06:58,420
Why? You're very good.

1157
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:01,407
Not as good as you.

1158
01:07:01,407 --> 01:07:04,065
Sol, am I pretty good?

1159
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:11,021
<i>[Han Yoon Ah, congratulations on passing
2018's baking technical skills exam.]</i>

1160
01:07:11,021 --> 01:07:12,391
What is it?

1161
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:14,599
It says I passed.

1162
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:17,400
I passed the exam
for my baking license, Dong Gu.

1163
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,766
Really?

1164
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,840
See? I told you you'd pass.

1165
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,260
Congratulations, Yoon Ah.

1166
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,489
Thank you.

1167
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:29,675
Wait, we have to do something
on a day like today.

1168
01:07:29,675 --> 01:07:31,297
Let's have a party today.

1169
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,485
Hold on and I'll go buy a cake.

1170
01:07:33,485 --> 01:07:35,036
Wait...

1171
01:07:41,164 --> 01:07:42,777
Yoon Ah.
