00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:19,559
To all of those who are here
with us at our Waikiki guest house

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,704
I truly want to thank you.

6
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:26,472
I sincerely hope you have a
great vacation while you are here.

7
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:27,885
Next.

8
00:00:27,885 --> 00:00:29,792
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Gentlemen.

9
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,597
Thank you.

10
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,360
Woo!

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,841
That... that's it?

12
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:35,990
I said a long thing.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,250
I compressed mine.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,530
Just get the point across.

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,033
Never mind.
What can I expect from you?

16
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:44,554
Now, let's have some fun tonight.

17
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:47,121
Cheers!

18
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:54,781
What's wrong with him?

19
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,889
He got dumped recently.

20
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,527
Don't worry about him.

21
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:04,087
We'll have fun together.

22
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:06,878
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

23
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:10,974
What's wrong with her?

24
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:13,231
She also got dumped a few days ago.

25
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:16,843
It was a very sad situation
that happened in a miserable way.

26
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,504
Don't worry about those two.
Once again, let's...

27
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:21,504
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

28
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:23,911
It's okay. I'm going up to rest.

29
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:26,959
Why? Things were just getting good.
Where are you all going?

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,631
- Wait.
- Guests!

31
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:31,108
- Stop, stop.
- Hey, hey.

32
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:33,879
Mayday, mayday! Emergency.

33
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,337
Hey, hey!

34
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:36,653
Gosh.

35
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:41,475
Hey, stop blowing your nose.

36
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,313
You'll blow out
your bone marrow at this rate.

37
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,587
How long are you
going to keep this up?

38
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:48,460
Can't you see the guests
are uncomfortable?

39
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,084
I'm sorry, Joon Ki.

40
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:52,855
I keep thinking about Tae Hyun.

41
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:55,263
I can't stop the tears.

42
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:56,813
- What's she saying?
- What did she say?

43
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:59,600
Don't cry.

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,317
Seo Jin!

45
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:12,439
- That scared me.
- Is he Jean Valjean or something?

46
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,814
Senior, what are you doing here?

47
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:24,205
I wanted to see you.
I wanted to see you so badly.

48
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,358
Weren't you disappointed by me?

49
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,293
Why would I be?

50
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:30,532
Because of your mustache?

51
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:33,501
Who cares about that, you dummy!

52
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,788
Are you stupid?

53
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:38,879
Even if bananas grew out of your head...

54
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,228
Even if kelp and seaweed
grew out of your armpits...

55
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:44,231
He must be crazy.

56
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,938
I don't care at all, Seo Jin.

57
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,498
Senior.

58
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,062
Do you want to officially start dating?

59
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,538
Senior Tae Hyun!

60
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:58,555
Whether it's kelp or seaweed,
I don't care.

61
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:02,975
They think they're in a film
or something, don't they?

62
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,984
It's a lowly third-rate
cult film, at that.

63
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:09,038
Don't you agree, Dong Gu?

64
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:12,129
I'm so envious.

65
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:22,012
<i>[Beautiful Farewell]</i>

66
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:24,230
- Come on. Come on.
- This one.

67
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:28,622
That's right. We got it!

68
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,102
Senior, here's a coffee.

69
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:46,417
Thank you.

70
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:49,377
Senior, your nose is bleeding.

71
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,247
It's okay.
I tend to get nosebleeds often.

72
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,048
These paintings are really nice.

73
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,806
We're already here.

74
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:15,591
- It's late. Go on in.
- Okay.

75
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,153
Oh yeah.

76
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,565
- Here.
- What is it?

77
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:35,038
Open it once you're inside.

78
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:36,653
I'll really get going now.

79
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,468
- Get home safely.
- Okay.

80
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,288
I've loved you since I was...

81
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,108
<i>You love me.</i>

82
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:02,927
I'm home.

83
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,377
You're home?
Did your date go well?

84
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:08,966
Chewbacca, why is your face so red?

85
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,855
Just like a person
who kissed someone.

86
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:12,115
No, I didn't. What kiss?

87
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:13,809
What do you mean? You totally did.

88
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:15,053
What is that?

89
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:17,055
This? It's a gift from Senior Tae Hyun.

90
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:19,742
A gift? Let me see. Give it to me.

91
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:21,365
No, why would you look at it?

92
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,612
Because I'm like a big brother.

93
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:25,495
Give it to me.
Why else would I look?

94
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:27,995
Oh, it looks nice.

95
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:36,019
What is it? What, what?

96
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,059
He bought you a razor?

97
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:40,485
Why would he...
Senior shouldn't have.

98
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,663
I've never seen such a thing
in all my life.

99
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:45,790
You're probably
the only woman in the world

100
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,918
who's received
a razor from her boyfriend.

101
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,136
Be quiet.

102
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:51,577
Don't you agree, Dong Gu? Huh?

103
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,516
What now? What?

104
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:55,677
Now that I think about it...

105
00:05:56,817 --> 00:06:00,658
I don't think I ever
bought Su Ah a proper gift.

106
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:12,658
It's kimbap!

107
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:14,634
Don't touch it.
It's for Senior Tae Hyun.

108
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,875
How cheap and petty of you.

109
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,079
- I won't eat it!
- Don't eat it.

110
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,372
You never even
made us a ramen in your life.

111
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:24,653
You are so devoted to your boyfriend!

112
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:26,894
Seriously, so petty.

113
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:28,696
Don't you agree, Dong Gu?

114
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:31,254
Again? What now?

115
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:35,213
I don't think I've ever made
Su Ah kimbap before.

116
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,161
How many guys
in this country do you think

117
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:39,110
have made kimbap for their girlfriends?

118
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,769
Don't you agree, Doo Shik?

119
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:47,454
Isn't it only right to ask
someone who's had a girlfriend?

120
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,766
- Sorry, man.
- You're bad.

121
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:24,451
Seo Jin, why are you standing there?

122
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:27,346
It's nothing.
Senior, you have a nosebleed.

123
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:31,567
I have a lot of stress due to my job.
I'm getting nosebleeds more often.

124
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,372
I see.

125
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,334
I'm almost done my article,
so wait just a bit.

126
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,047
Yeah, take your time.

127
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,160
I have to study too.

128
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,062
This is...

129
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:02,291
I'm done.

130
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,221
What is this anyway?

131
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:06,562
Oh, this? It's kimbap.

132
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,307
You made that for me?

133
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:10,923
Yes, why don't you try some?

134
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,677
It should be good.

135
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,127
- Wow.
- Here.

136
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,254
Seo Jin, you have to eat kimbap
with your hands to optimize the taste.

137
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,512
Looks good.

138
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:28,081
Yum, it's just so good.

139
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,536
You try one. Ah...

140
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:35,071
No, I will eat it on my own.

141
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,841
Come on, Seo Jin.
I want to feed it to you.

142
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:39,817
Try it. Hurry. Ah...

143
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,193
That's right. Go on.

144
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:42,778
- Ah...
- There you go.

145
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:44,532
You're eating well.

146
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:45,851
So cute.

147
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:48,245
Oh! What's that?

148
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:52,352
There was nothing there.
What was it?

149
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:54,562
I must have seen wrong.

150
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:57,475
Oh, you're so cute!

151
00:08:57,475 --> 00:09:00,363
Cutie, playful thing.

152
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:04,384
Seo Jin, only feeding you one
means I don't have affection for you.

153
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:07,390
- Ah...
- No, no.

154
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,253
It's okay.

155
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,346
Can't we watch something else now?

156
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:20,357
Just leave it.

157
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:22,714
It feels new every time I watch it.

158
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,437
Hm? There are no more tissues.

159
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,986
Don't touch the remote control.

160
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:35,729
Gosh!

161
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:37,168
I'm home.

162
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:39,110
Oh, Chewbacca. You're home?

163
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,623
How did your date go?

164
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,859
Yeah, well...

165
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:44,346
What's with your facial expression?
Did you two already fight?

166
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:46,052
No, it's not that.

167
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,015
Senior Tae Hyun has a strange habit.

168
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:50,034
What habit?

169
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,475
He picks his nose a lot.

170
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:54,586
People can pick their nose sometimes.
Sounds like nothing to me.

171
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,375
I'm telling you it's not nothing.

172
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,085
He doesn't wash his hand
after picking his nose and eats kimbap.

173
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:03,076
- Then he feeds me and pinches my cheek.
- Hey, Chewbacca.

174
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,467
You're being so selfish.

175
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:05,635
Why am I?

176
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:09,393
That Tae Hyun guy is overlooking your
mustache and you can't overlook that?

177
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:10,946
Is that the same thing?

178
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:12,980
Mine is physical and his is a habit.

179
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,581
Whatever! Talk to him
if it bothers you that much.

180
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,870
Can I do that?
What if he gets mad?

181
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,104
He was understanding about your
mustache, so this is nothing.

182
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:21,924
My seat.

183
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,803
What now? What, what, what?

184
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:29,245
There's no toilet paper in the bathroom.

185
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,938
Oh, my head. My head hurts.

186
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:35,524
Dong Gu, I made some porridge.
Try having some.

187
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,134
I have no appetite.

188
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:38,897
How long are you going to keep this up?

189
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:41,220
You haven't slept
or eaten in days. You'll die!

190
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,190
Just leave me to die.
I don't even want to live.

191
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,979
Crazy punk. What a crazy punk.

192
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:52,292
Have you nothing better to do than waste
your life on a mere girl like Su Ah?

193
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,249
What?

194
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:56,856
"Mere girl like Su Ah"?

195
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,490
Joon Ki, are you done?

196
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,657
What did I say wrong?

197
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,008
She may seem like nothing much to you.

198
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,918
She was true love to me.

199
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:08,437
I won't forget my memories
with Su Ah until I die!

200
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:11,231
It is a wound that will never heal!
Do you know that?

201
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,714
How dare he get mad at me? Hey, you!

202
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:48,606
What are you doing here alone?

203
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,849
Nothing, really.

204
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,024
It's very hard, isn't it?

205
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:03,711
A sudden breakup is so hard
that you feel like dying.

206
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,393
I've been through it,
so I know it very well.

207
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:10,844
Still, Dong Gu,
though it feels so painful right now

208
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,100
you will eventually forget
once time passes.

209
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,711
- So--
- No.

210
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:16,413
It's not like that for me.

211
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:20,740
10 years... no, even 100 years
could pass and I wouldn't forget Su Ah.

212
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,096
Why?

213
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:24,662
There was so much I couldn't do for her.

214
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,370
I regret it so much.

215
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:31,932
Do you know what I regret the most?

216
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:37,980
I couldn't even give her
a beautiful farewell.

217
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,619
If I could meet her one last time...

218
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:46,375
If I could give her a farewell
that I wouldn't regret...

219
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,634
I'd want to give her
one that's beautiful.

220
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:12,546
What brings you here?

221
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:15,298
I came because I had a favor to ask.

222
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:16,479
What favor?

223
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,918
Please meet Dong Gu just once.

224
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:19,923
Why would I?

225
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:22,293
Dong Gu is going through
a very tough time.

226
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:24,926
He can't sleep or eat
and all he does is cry.

227
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:26,753
What does that have to do with me?

228
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:29,611
I heard you dated for four years.

229
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:32,493
Then you shouldn't
just end things like this.

230
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,745
So, if you could meet Dong Gu
just one last time--

231
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:37,509
I told you I don't want to,
so please go.

232
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:39,172
I need to work.

233
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:44,488
Please don't do that.
Think of it as saving a person just once.

234
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:46,629
Please, Su Ah.

235
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:53,616
Su Ah, Su Ah, Su Ah!

236
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,383
Please don't do that
and just meet him once.

237
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:58,392
I said no, so just leave.

238
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:02,274
Su Ah! Don't be like that
and see him just once.

239
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,110
Please, Su Ah!

240
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,994
Su Ah!

241
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:20,163
Why are you staring?
Is there something on my face?

242
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,927
No. It's nothing.

243
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,832
I'm almost done,
so wait just a bit.

244
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,301
All right.

245
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,354
<i>[Nose, nose, nose, nose...]</i>

246
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,261
Senior.

247
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:50,886
You startled me. What is it?

248
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:53,048
I'm very sorry.

249
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:55,957
But could you please
stop picking your nose?

250
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:59,720
Ah, sorry, I didn't realize.

251
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:08,561
Could you also please stop rolling it
into a ball and flicking it?

252
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:11,940
All right. I'm sorry.

253
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,812
I was conflicted
about saying this to you.

254
00:15:16,812 --> 00:15:19,371
- I have to say it today.
- Okay.

255
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:21,682
Did you know you have
a severe nose-picking habit?

256
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:22,918
Really? I do?

257
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:26,537
Yes. Also, you said you
tend to get nosebleeds a lot.

258
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:30,517
That's not it.
It's because you pick your nose a lot.

259
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,485
I must have picked up
the habit unconsciously.

260
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:33,902
I'm really sorry.

261
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:39,186
It's okay. You can fix habits.

262
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:42,937
You're not feeling bad, are you?

263
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:46,655
No, you told me for my sake.
Why would I feel bad?

264
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,128
I'm so relieved.

265
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,628
Then let's go have a beer somewhere.

266
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:51,745
Let's go, Senior.

267
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:53,576
Okay. Sure.

268
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:02,024
Dong Gu, over here.

269
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:04,731
What? Why did you call me out here?

270
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,982
There's a part-time employee
I used to work with at the store.

271
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:10,201
She kept asking me
to set her up with someone.

272
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,903
- And?
- What else? I'm telling you to meet her.

273
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:15,148
They say you need to meet someone
to get over your ex.

274
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,467
- So...
- Are you crazy?

275
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:19,416
- What is it?
- Do you take me that lightly?

276
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,812
When I think about Su Ah,
I still feel a tense pain right here.

277
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:26,447
I'm not ready to send Su Ah off yet
and I don't want to, okay?

278
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,442
- Seriously.
- How can you just leave?

279
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:29,846
- You're crazy.
- Just say hello.

280
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:33,048
There she is. Over here, Mi Na.

281
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,470
Mi Na, this is the friend
I told you about, Kang Dong Gu.

282
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,500
Hello, my name is Lee Mi Na.

283
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,240
Hello.

284
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,591
I'm saying hello because of you.
Don't do this again, okay?

285
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,120
Yeah. Okay.

286
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,429
I heard a lot about you from Doo Shik.

287
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:58,990
Really?

288
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:01,684
Ah, I see.

289
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,556
Should we go have coffee then?

290
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,727
Why don't we go drinking instead?

291
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,407
- Should we do that?
- But, Mi Na...

292
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:10,676
I am afraid that
Dong Gu has to go home.

293
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,534
He actually broke up
with his girlfriend a few days ago.

294
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,326
He doesn't feel like being set up.

295
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,596
Oh, I see.

296
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:21,011
It's okay. There's nothing we can do.

297
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:24,606
Dong Gu, I'm sorry
I didn't know how you felt.

298
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:27,576
Go on in now. Go and rest.

299
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:28,895
Get plenty of rest, okay?

300
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:30,345
Yes, I will.

301
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:33,742
It was still nice to meet you.
I'll see you next time.

302
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:36,576
Doo Shik, you have to
treat me to grilled clams, okay?

303
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:37,761
Okay.

304
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:40,415
What have you been doing lately?
You haven't called.

305
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,547
<i>Hey, Kang Dong Gu.
Why are you looking?</i>

306
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,151
<i>You're not regretting it, are you?</i>

307
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,298
<i>You've only just broken up with Su Ah.</i>

308
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:52,303
<i>Pull yourself together, Kang Dong Gu.</i>

309
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:57,921
Yum, this is good.

310
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,326
What appetizer should we order?

311
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:03,032
Sesame leaf... sesame leaf pasta?

312
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:05,631
Senior! You're doing it again.

313
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:10,867
- Sorry.
- This really won't do.

314
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:13,326
We need to take special measures.

315
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,525
Special measures?

316
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:22,739
Seo Jin, do we
really need to go this far?

317
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:25,048
We have no choice
in order to fix your habit.

318
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:26,486
Why? You don't want to?

319
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,422
No, I'll do it.

320
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,203
Senior, cheers.

321
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:32,056
Hold on.

322
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,580
Cheers.

323
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,721
Cheers.

324
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,711
Mi Na, eat up.

325
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:50,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

326
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,211
Hey, Dong Gu.

327
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:53,651
You guys were here?

328
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:56,019
Mi Na wanted to eat grilled clams.

329
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,441
What brings you here?

330
00:18:57,441 --> 00:19:01,079
I wanted to gather my thoughts,
so I thought I'd have some soju.

331
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,230
- Alone?
- Yes.

332
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,090
- Alone at a grilled clam place?
- Yes. Why?

333
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,446
I come alone two to three times a week.

334
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,980
Is that weird?

335
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,609
Would you like to join us, then?

336
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,772
- Should I?
- No, Mi Na.

337
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:14,378
Dong Gu wants to
gather his thoughts on his own.

338
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:17,451
He's not in a good place lately.

339
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:21,332
Dong Gu, don't worry about us
and eat lots.

340
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:24,146
- Eat up.
- Yeah, okay.

341
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:33,848
What would you like?

342
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,983
One soju and an order of grilled clams.

343
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:37,809
By yourself? It'll be a lot.

344
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,114
I eat like that two
to three times a week.

345
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:41,748
Give it to me.

346
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:47,306
<i>Why is there so darn much?</i>

347
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:49,108
<i>I keep eating,
but there's still so much.</i>

348
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:51,085
I'll pour it for you.

349
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,978
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

350
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:59,203
Mi Na, isn't that person really dense?

351
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:02,415
How could a person be so dense like that?

352
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,461
Who was it?

353
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:06,692
His name is Lee Joon Ki.
We live together.

354
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:10,963
He must be naturally that way.
How could he not get it?

355
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:13,299
- Doo Shik, have a drink.
- Okay.

356
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:18,153
That was really good.
Should we get going now?

357
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,467
Shall we?

358
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,368
You're going too?

359
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:25,263
Yes, I was just about to leave.

360
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:26,993
You have lots of clams left.

361
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,644
Oh, this? I'm going to
take them to go for Sol.

362
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:33,996
You're giving clams to a baby
who just passed 100 days old?

363
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:36,684
You can blend them
and give them to her.

364
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:38,984
Ma'am, I'll take this to go.

365
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:54,344
Senior, there you go again!

366
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:56,896
You do it whenever I'm not around.

367
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:01,333
Seo Jin, this is going too far though.

368
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,923
How is it going too far?

369
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:05,603
I'm going to hit you whenever
you pick your nose, just so you know.

370
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,472
All right. Let's just stop.

371
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:09,337
How can I stop?

372
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:12,614
You must not take me seriously to
go right back to picking your nose.

373
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:14,391
Why won't you listen
even after I tell you?

374
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:16,163
I said please just stop.

375
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:17,647
Why are you getting angry?

376
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,271
Is picking one's nose some deadly crime?

377
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:21,538
I'm doing this all for your sake.

378
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:24,588
You get frequent nosebleeds
and it's bad for hygiene.

379
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:29,386
Honestly... it's unpleasant to look at.

380
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,416
"Unpleasant to look at."

381
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,915
Then what about your mustache?

382
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:38,748
Why would you bring that up?

383
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:41,721
I understood your mustache.
Why can't you understand me?

384
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:43,183
How are the two alike?

385
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:45,839
Mine is physical and yours is a habit.

386
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,455
I have a physical issue
where I get lots of snot.

387
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:49,634
What did you say?

388
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:53,952
Honestly, what's more strange between
your mustache and my nose-picking?

389
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:56,732
Are you curious? Should I ask people?

390
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,068
Excuse me!

391
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:01,457
Right now, this woman grows a mustache.

392
00:22:01,457 --> 00:22:03,897
What's more strange between a
mustache and picking one's nose?

393
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:06,276
Senior, why are you doing this?
It's embarrassing.

394
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:09,344
Embarrassing? You're embarrassed of me?

395
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:12,243
I'm embarrassed of you too.
Do you know why?

396
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:15,007
When I have dates with you
from morning to evening

397
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,560
your mustache starts to grow.

398
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,619
I can start to see it.

399
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:22,883
Then when I kiss you...

400
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,107
it feels so rough.

401
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:28,717
On the days that I kiss you,
I go home and apply ointment.

402
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:30,364
Having to do that...

403
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,084
I endured all of that.

404
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:36,132
So, why are you making me feel
so wretched over picking my nose?

405
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:38,345
If it bothered you so much,
why didn't you mention it?

406
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:39,873
How did you bear it?

407
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:41,718
So narrow-minded.

408
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:43,306
What? Narrow-minded?

409
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:45,510
Are you finished?

410
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,320
Yes, I called you narrow-minded.

411
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,460
What kind of a guy is so narrow-minded?

412
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,230
Yes, I'm narrow-minded.
What about it, hairy woman?

413
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,420
Hairy woman?

414
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,250
- You snot!
- Snot?

415
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,596
Yes, you snot!

416
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,939
Don't even call me snot.
You're Huam-dong's hairy woman.

417
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,429
Huam-dong's hairy woman?

418
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:04,721
- You're Wangsimni's snot!
- Wangsim...

419
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:05,989
What do you take Wangsimni for?

420
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:08,268
I won't accept this. Let's break up.

421
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:09,641
Yes, let's break up.

422
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,000
Don't contact me again, you snot.

423
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,103
Don't contact me.
You're Huam-dong's hairy woman.

424
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,508
Can't hear you. Snot, snot, snot.

425
00:23:14,508 --> 00:23:17,488
You're Huam-dong's hairy woman.
Hairy woman, hairy woman...

426
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:19,797
Please, can you be quiet?

427
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:23,703
Oh, you scared me.

428
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:25,673
You're still here?

429
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:29,131
Please just come see Dong Gu
one last time.

430
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:30,800
Why are you doing this?

431
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,953
- Did Dong Gu put you up to this?
- No.

432
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,064
Then why are you the one doing this?

433
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:39,310
Being unable to have a proper
goodbye with a person you love

434
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,092
is something I know a lot about.

435
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:45,771
So, please meet with him one last time.

436
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,823
I'm asking you this favor.

437
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:50,173
No, thank you.

438
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:52,188
I don't want to see his face again.

439
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:55,156
Just give up and leave.

440
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:56,916
Gosh.

441
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,354
You're being too harsh.

442
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,650
Su Ah.

443
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,586
If you keep this up,
I won't stand for it.

444
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:08,659
What?

445
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,287
What are you going to do then?

446
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:15,115
Gosh.

447
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:17,748
Hey! My bag.

448
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,057
What kind of person does that?

449
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:21,845
Hey, you!

450
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:25,288
Thanks for the meal today, Doo Shik.

451
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:26,407
It was nothing.

452
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:28,744
Don't forget the date I'm
setting up for you on Friday.

453
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:30,634
<i>What? A date?</i>

454
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,498
<i>He's already introducing her
to someone else?</i>

455
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:34,974
<i>I don't even have her number yet.
That disloyal punk.</i>

456
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:38,653
<i>Wait. Why do you need her number?</i>

457
00:24:38,653 --> 00:24:40,799
<i>Do you really have an interest in her?</i>

458
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,682
<i>Get it together.
Get it together, Kang Dong Gu!</i>

459
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:50,119
- Ouch.
- Oh, that startled me.

460
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,891
What? You haven't left yet?

461
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,070
What's the matter?

462
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,611
I have something stuck in my teeth.
Do you have a business card, Mi Na?

463
00:24:57,611 --> 00:24:58,953
Why do you need a business card?

464
00:24:58,953 --> 00:25:01,563
Business cards are the best to
get at food stuck between teeth.

465
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:05,122
I get so annoyed with food
in my teeth that I throw a fit.

466
00:25:05,122 --> 00:25:06,342
I didn't know that.

467
00:25:06,342 --> 00:25:07,911
Mi Na, do you have a business card?

468
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,981
Hey, I have one.

469
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:12,261
<i>[Pig's Mom]</i>
Here it is.

470
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,321
This is a card you cherish
that you got from Pig's Mom.

471
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:17,553
- How can I use that?
- Maybe you're right.

472
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:18,942
Hold on. I have another one.

473
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:20,019
Do you have one, Mi Na?

474
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,769
A business card. One moment.
I'm not sure...

475
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:28,894
Oh, I have one that
I used from my old job.

476
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,306
Yes, this is it.
This kind of corner is best.

477
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:33,737
This is my favorite kind of corner.

478
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:36,237
This angle is just perfect.

479
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:38,596
This can be really hard to find.

480
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:40,132
Oh, what a relief.

481
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:42,306
You should get going then.

482
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:46,855
What's with him?

483
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,142
That was natural.

484
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:53,990
That was brilliant. Very good.

485
00:25:58,073 --> 00:26:00,998
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah! Please stop.

486
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:04,528
Only if you say you'll meet Dong Gu.

487
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,731
Give it back while I'm still being nice.

488
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:14,371
I won't give it to you until you
say you'll meet with Dong Gu.

489
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:16,740
Seriously, why are you being like this?

490
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,951
You can't be like this
with someone you once loved.

491
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:22,560
Don't be this way and see him just once.

492
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,210
All right. All right!

493
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,269
Really?

494
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:29,874
- Where is Dong Gu?
- Probably the guest house.

495
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:31,503
Let's go.

496
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:37,628
It's Kang Dong Gu
who you were set up with today.

497
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:41,342
Just calling to see if you got home okay.

498
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:44,151
It was nice meeting you today.

499
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:47,528
Su Ah.

500
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,729
You went out on a date today, Dong Gu?

501
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:53,125
How is it that Su Ah is here?

502
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:56,480
You said you wanted nothing more
than to see her just once.

503
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,631
Yes, that's true...

504
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:59,221
Su Ah, what happened here is...

505
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:01,645
Dong Gu, should we go talk?

506
00:27:01,645 --> 00:27:03,391
Huh?

507
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,926
Okay... yes.

508
00:27:15,428 --> 00:27:18,013
Su Ah, it's a misunderstanding.
It really is.

509
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:23,597
I had no intention of being set up,
but Doo Shik suddenly called me out.

510
00:27:23,597 --> 00:27:25,798
I must've gone crazy for a moment.

511
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,372
I'm really sorry, Su Ah.

512
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,109
Dong Gu.

513
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,105
You don't need to be sorry to me.

514
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:38,170
I have no right
to hear those words from you.

515
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:43,570
Thank you so much for liking me
for the past four years.

516
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,588
I was happy.

517
00:27:45,588 --> 00:27:47,640
- But--
- Stop.

518
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,579
What... what are you going to say?

519
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,288
Get angry instead.

520
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:56,119
If you do this, I can't even beg.

521
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,304
It really feels over.

522
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:04,000
Su Ah, I'll be better.

523
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,328
I'll be 100, no, 1,000 times
better than that guy.

524
00:28:06,328 --> 00:28:08,358
- So, Su Ah--
- Dong Gu.

525
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:11,470
You were very good to me
all those years.

526
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,087
It's not your fault
that this happened to us.

527
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:15,964
It's all my fault.

528
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,703
I changed.

529
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:24,670
But, you know what?
I'm so happy with Yoon Seok.

530
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:28,625
So, you should forget about me.

531
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,224
I want you to be happy too.

532
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:36,480
Sorry.

533
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:40,181
I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

534
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:42,656
I'm really sorry, Dong Gu.

535
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:54,013
Thank you for liking me all those years.

536
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:01,970
I'll get going now.

537
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:48,770
"You all live for tomorrow."

538
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,471
"Those who live for tomorrow will die
at the hands of he who lives for today."

539
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:55,800
"I only live for today."

540
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:59,828
"Just how screwed up that is..."

541
00:30:01,221 --> 00:30:03,336
"I will show you."

542
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:10,518
- Leave your profile there.
- Yes, Sir.

543
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:17,397
What you saw just now was
rookie actor, Lee Joon Ki.

544
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:19,460
Please remember me.

545
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:27,371
Good luck with your project.

546
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:38,304
<i>[Are You Still Dreaming?]</i>

547
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,770
Bye. See you again.

548
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,461
Bye.

549
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:43,961
I'm home.

550
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:45,642
Where did you go dressed up so early?

551
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:48,753
I thought of it as morning exercise
and distributed my profile everywhere.

552
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:50,848
What good is it
to give your profile to everyone?

553
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,239
You never have any lines
and always stand in the background.

554
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:56,326
- It's a waste of paper.
- What did you say?

555
00:30:56,326 --> 00:30:59,203
Is that anything to say to someone
who just worked all morning?

556
00:30:59,203 --> 00:31:04,210
Gosh, that's why you got called
"hairy woman" by your first love.

557
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,200
Hey, I told you not to say that.

558
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,019
Don't say it. Just don't say it!

559
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:11,450
Stop fighting. We have guests.

560
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,644
- Kang Seo Jin!
- Let me go.

561
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,435
What's with the camera?
Why do you need that?

562
00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:17,820
I have a shoot tomorrow.

563
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,300
A shoot? Since when?

564
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,662
Oh, I agreed to
help Tae Shik with his work.

565
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:22,952
Why the sudden part-time job?

566
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:24,347
I want to make money.

567
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:26,169
Money? Is something wrong?

568
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,387
No, nothing's wrong.

569
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,478
Oh... Su Ah and I broke up for good.

570
00:31:36,465 --> 00:31:40,997
It seems like she met a good person,
so I want to send her off.

571
00:31:42,395 --> 00:31:45,256
What does breaking up with Su Ah
have to do with making money?

572
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:49,237
Now that I broke up with Su Ah,
I realized I only have films left.

573
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:52,048
I want to focus this year
and go all-in on films.

574
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:56,752
Hey, I want to have enough production
money within a year for our film.

575
00:31:56,752 --> 00:31:58,964
Joon Ki, keep practicing your acting.

576
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:02,424
You need to hurry up
and finish that script.

577
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:06,517
Kang Dong Gu with the strong will.
I see the old you!

578
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:08,757
Are you going to write
what you talked about back then?

579
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:11,411
You mean that story about the
US president and Bruce Lee?

580
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:24,101
Gosh. How long will his resolve last?

581
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:29,436
Why are you sighing?

582
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:32,223
Yoon Ah, what is it?
Is something wrong?

583
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:35,342
Seo Jin, do you have a dream too?

584
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:39,333
Yes, I have a dream. To be a reporter.

585
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,623
I dreamed of becoming one
since I was little.

586
00:32:41,623 --> 00:32:45,894
But I've failed the interview
so many times that I can't remember.

587
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:47,633
Why do you ask?

588
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,093
Because I envy it.

589
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,701
Everyone has a dream.

590
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:54,242
Dong Gu, Joon Ki, Doo Shik, and you.

591
00:32:54,242 --> 00:32:57,301
You sure envy strange things.
Don't you have a dream?

592
00:32:57,301 --> 00:33:00,416
I did, but how can I have a dream
in my situation?

593
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,256
What does that have to do
with your dream?

594
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:06,046
My situation isn't so good.
I have Sol too.

595
00:33:06,855 --> 00:33:10,328
Yoon Ah, do you know who
Joanne Rowling is?

596
00:33:10,328 --> 00:33:12,328
She was a divorcee with a child.

597
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:15,138
All she had for income was
a weekly 15,000 won.

598
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:17,826
She was lacking formula for the baby,
so she mixed in water.

599
00:33:17,826 --> 00:33:22,000
She overcame that and
do you know which book she wrote?

600
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,604
It was "Harry Potter." "Harry Potter."

601
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:27,631
Saying her life was hard,
she had no time

602
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,342
or her family didn't have money?

603
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,693
Those are all just excuses.

604
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,960
So, tell me what your dream is.

605
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,861
I'll help you if it's too hard,
so just tell me.

606
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:41,945
Rapper.

607
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:43,760
Rap... rapper?

608
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,721
A rapper like Dok2 or BewhY?

609
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:48,540
Why? Is it weird?

610
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,604
It's not that it's weird,
just unexpected.

611
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:52,884
Do you know how to rap?

612
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:55,824
A little bit. Should I try it?

613
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:57,959
Okay. Sure.

614
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:05,486
<i>Yeah. Get it.</i>

615
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:08,387
<i>The world is spread out before me.
It's an illusion.</i>

616
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:11,451
<i>Delicious table of food.
The best is the on the prime minister's.</i>

617
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,599
<i>Or maybe it's the president's table?
Perhaps not?</i>

618
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,858
<i>You loser. Unwanted wild man.</i>

619
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:19,005
<i>Misery. Yeah.</i>

620
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:26,657
- How was it?
- Oh, it had character.

621
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:29,210
If you practice a bit more,
I think it'll be better.

622
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,547
Really? Then you think I can go for it?

623
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:35,023
Of course, why can't you?

624
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:36,552
It is your dream.

625
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:37,894
Thank you, Seo Jin.

626
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:41,161
I would've kept it buried in my heart
forever if not for you.

627
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:44,041
- Thank you, Seo Jin.
- No need to thank me.

628
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,771
Keep at it.

629
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,760
No, you can't die.

630
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,041
Private.

631
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:53,717
There's a radio.

632
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,692
Mayday, mayday. Emergency!

633
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:58,996
Gosh, are they even coming?

634
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:02,858
Private, you have to hold on. Private!

635
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:07,153
Private? Private!

636
00:35:07,153 --> 00:35:08,885
Those jerks.

637
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:16,072
Let's meet in the afterlife.

638
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:23,061
That is all.

639
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,119
By the way...

640
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,371
did you come here knowing
what our film was about?

641
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:29,856
Yes, Director.

642
00:35:29,856 --> 00:35:32,586
Marine, like the marine troops, right?

643
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:35,047
No, it's about a swimmer.

644
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,918
Marine Boy, Park Tae Hwan.
Swimming, the Olympics, and youth.

645
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,134
I'm sorry, Director.

646
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:42,675
I've been going to so many auditions.
I will do it again.

647
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:44,876
No, you don't need to. You can go.

648
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:45,922
What?

649
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:50,248
Director, please give me another chance.
I'm a great swimmer.

650
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,657
The role doesn't matter
and I don't need to be paid.

651
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:55,300
Please just give me anything, Director.

652
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,449
Please!

653
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:59,074
Then take off your clothes.

654
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:01,262
Excuse me?

655
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:02,550
Why do you suddenly need that?

656
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,215
It's about swimmers.

657
00:36:04,215 --> 00:36:07,356
You need to have a good body in
order to get a minor role or something.

658
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:09,393
Yes, I'll get undressed.

659
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:15,070
Oh, wait. Is that all body hair?

660
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,369
Yes, it is.

661
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:18,237
- Are your legs like that too?
- Ah, yes.

662
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:20,588
I have a lot of male hormones in my body.

663
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:21,652
- You fail.
- What?

664
00:36:21,652 --> 00:36:22,931
Zip up and go.

665
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,023
But... but why?

666
00:36:24,023 --> 00:36:26,224
Have you seen a swimmer as hairy as you?

667
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:28,478
Swimmers try to minimize air resistance

668
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,733
so they get shave
their armpits and heads.

669
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:33,016
They even get rid of hair there.
Don't you know?

670
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:38,356
I will get rid of it.

671
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:41,505
Except for the hair on my head,
I'll get rid of everything else.

672
00:36:41,505 --> 00:36:43,320
Do not worry, Director!

673
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:47,005
Marine... ouch.

674
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:07,418
So, this is where they do it.

675
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,452
Gosh, do I really have to do this?

676
00:37:15,452 --> 00:37:17,679
I'm going crazy.

677
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,159
What is this?

678
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,159
Why is this all torn apart?

679
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,289
Oh my.

680
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:23,659
Hello!

681
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,322
Yes, who are you?

682
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:27,391
I'm the waxer who will be waxing you.

683
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:29,054
You will be doing it for me?

684
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:31,264
Don't be shy about it.

685
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,144
Many other men get it done too.

686
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:35,213
Really?

687
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:37,474
Well, let's not waste time
and do it, then.

688
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:39,552
Then get started and lie down.

689
00:37:39,552 --> 00:37:41,360
Should we put this away?

690
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,652
Keep it. You will need it.

691
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:46,407
Please remove your gown, then.

692
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:57,351
I'll get started.

693
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:01,659
Bear with me even if it hurts.

694
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,112
I'm removing the sheet.

695
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:11,438
Ouch. Ow! What was that?

696
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:24,152
So that's why I need this.

697
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:31,268
<i>[President is Bruce Lee]</i>

698
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:36,103
Are you trying to create fake views?

699
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:37,425
Do you have to do that?

700
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:39,793
Everyone else does it too.

701
00:38:39,793 --> 00:38:43,331
Why aren't there views?
It's driving me nuts.

702
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:44,492
- Seo Jin.
- Hm?

703
00:38:44,492 --> 00:38:45,873
Lend me your ID.

704
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:47,463
- Why?
- To put up comments.

705
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:48,907
No thanks.

706
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:53,637
Seo Jin, I made a song.

707
00:38:53,637 --> 00:38:55,498
- Would you like to hear it?
- What?

708
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:58,492
You already wrote something?

709
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:00,806
A song? What kind of song?

710
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:03,581
Yoon Ah says her dream
is to become a rapper.

711
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:04,795
Rap... rapper?

712
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:06,925
So, you know how to rap?

713
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:10,884
Yes, I wrote something
with Seo Jin in mind.

714
00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:11,894
Would you listen?

715
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,643
Yes, sure.

716
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,514
I had no clue you had this kind of skill.

717
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,849
- Give me a beat.
- Sure.

718
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,369
<i>Yeah. Get it.</i>

719
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:29,148
<i>Your eyes are the eyes of hawks.</i>

720
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:31,519
<i>You're like a hawk with your career.</i>

721
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,989
<i>Hungry? How many amps?</i>

722
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,860
<i>Try and fool my eyes.
I can see into your heart.</i>

723
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,552
<i>Try and hide away.
You're dead if I find you.</i>

724
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:41,096
<i>I'll beat you up if I catch you.</i>

725
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:43,083
<i>Don't make a move if you're scared.</i>

726
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,320
Yeah. Woo, woo!

727
00:39:50,273 --> 00:39:52,514
What did you think?

728
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:54,782
Oh, yeah. It's good.

729
00:39:54,782 --> 00:39:59,036
There a uniqueness to it
and a grotesque charm, too.

730
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:01,943
Really? I have one more song.
Do you want to hear it?

731
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:03,612
No. Oh, it's not that.

732
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:07,235
I just have to shower now,
so I'll listen later.

733
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:08,856
Later...

734
00:40:18,393 --> 00:40:21,653
Seo Jin, I'll get started.

735
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:22,675
<i>Get it.</i>

736
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:25,911
<i>My name is Han Yoon Ah.</i>

737
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:28,942
<i>In English, Yoon Ah Han.</i>

738
00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:32,103
<i>Your name is Kang Seo Jin.</i>

739
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:36,353
<i>Backwards, it is Jin Seo Kang.</i>

740
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,001
Geez.

741
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:40,088
That was shocking.

742
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:43,496
Isn't it too much to become
a rapper with those skills?

743
00:40:47,722 --> 00:40:49,523
What are you doing? Get out.

744
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:51,447
Sorry. Why didn't say you were here?

745
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,400
How can I when I was showering?

746
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:56,559
Wait a minute.

747
00:40:57,277 --> 00:41:00,717
Joon Ki! What is that?
What happened there?

748
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:02,005
It's nothing. It's nothing.

749
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:03,833
What do you mean?

750
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,574
- I said it's nothing.
- Move.

751
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:07,135
Where did it all go?

752
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:09,005
It's because of the temperature.

753
00:41:09,005 --> 00:41:11,971
- Stop turning me around.
- Where did it all go?

754
00:41:14,313 --> 00:41:18,400
A Brazilian wax? Why would you do that?

755
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,289
The director told me to,
so what could I do?

756
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:21,978
I wouldn't get the role otherwise.

757
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:23,918
You're really doing
all sorts of crazy things.

758
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:26,610
- What's the role.
- Swimmer Eight.

759
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:30,146
Seeing that you have no name,
you probably have no lines.

760
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:31,947
Swimmer Eight is pretty great too.

761
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,398
There's even a Swimmer 28.
What do you know?

762
00:41:34,398 --> 00:41:35,547
Oh, really?

763
00:41:35,547 --> 00:41:38,003
Wow, there are 28 swimmers?

764
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:39,054
Shut up!

765
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,056
Oh, it's Ji Soo.

766
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:44,246
Hello. Yes, Ji Soo.

767
00:41:44,246 --> 00:41:45,688
Yes, it's Joon Ki.

768
00:41:45,688 --> 00:41:47,963
Tomorrow? I'm not doing much. Why?

769
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,567
Oh, with your mother!

770
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:52,277
Yes, yes. Of course. Okay.

771
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:54,347
Yes, see you tomorrow. Okay.

772
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:56,610
You already have a new girlfriend?

773
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,137
How many days will it last this time?

774
00:41:58,137 --> 00:42:00,456
I'm very serious this time.

775
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:02,824
Can't you tell when I'm having
a meal with her mother?

776
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:04,253
- Oh.
- Really?

777
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:05,802
You must really be serious.

778
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:07,307
I really am.

779
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:10,853
It feels different than
all the other girls I've dated.

780
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:15,378
Dong Gu, did you feel like this
when you dated Su Ah too?

781
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,110
Yeah, well...

782
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,702
- Joon Ki.
- What?

783
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,248
I was just asking in passing.

784
00:42:29,248 --> 00:42:32,690
- Sorry.
- No need to be sorry.

785
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:36,407
- Hope it works out.
- Thank you.

786
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:38,648
Gosh, seriously.

787
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:40,637
You are so unaware of the situation.

788
00:42:40,637 --> 00:42:42,735
Why would you bring up Su Ah?

789
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:43,952
I didn't do it on purpose.

790
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:47,215
Also, he said it was okay.
Why are you throwing a fit?

791
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:48,684
He doesn't look okay.

792
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:50,576
He's fine. Just look after yourself.

793
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:52,208
Thank you. Thank you.

794
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,454
What are you doing here?

795
00:43:19,336 --> 00:43:21,384
Just sitting here.

796
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:23,940
You were thinking about Su Ah,
weren't you?

797
00:43:26,996 --> 00:43:28,568
It's hard, isn't it?

798
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:31,885
You don't have to say anything.
I know how hard it is.

799
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,835
I also know that words
can't console you right now.

800
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:41,615
So, I prepared something for you.

801
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:45,617
What is it? What?

802
00:43:47,282 --> 00:43:50,630
<i>Yeah. Get it.</i>

803
00:43:51,452 --> 00:43:54,650
<i>Wounds of a breakup,
bear into your heart, tears fall.</i>

804
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,579
<i>Don't cry even when
you're lonely and sad.</i>

805
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,349
<i>Are you Candy? No, you're Dong Gu.</i>

806
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:02,347
What are you doing?
What's with the sudden rap?

807
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:03,755
<i>Look into my eyes.</i>

808
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:08,599
<i>Lesson, you can forget Su Ah.
You can erase Su Ah.</i>

809
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,003
So scary. Stop it.

810
00:44:10,003 --> 00:44:11,715
Why are you suddenly rapping?
Are you crazy?

811
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:14,414
<i>Now, run. Run toward your dream.</i>

812
00:44:14,414 --> 00:44:16,090
<i>You're just going to go. Where?</i>

813
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,820
I said stop. Why are you rapping?

814
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,284
You're a really strange lady.
Why are you rapping?

815
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,338
<i>I know where.</i>

816
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:26,094
I told you to stop.
Why are you doing this?

817
00:44:26,094 --> 00:44:27,398
<i>Yeah!</i>

818
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:35,467
Where's Joon Ki?

819
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:38,938
He got dressed up and left this
morning to meet his girlfriend's mom.

820
00:44:38,938 --> 00:44:40,637
Oh yeah.

821
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,007
You're going to work too, right?

822
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:43,992
Yeah, I'm shooting a baby's birthday.

823
00:44:43,992 --> 00:44:45,210
Are you going to the library?

824
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,320
Yeah, I have a study group.

825
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,192
<i>You, me, here, this, noise, we, know.</i>

826
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:56,190
Why is that lady suddenly doing that?

827
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,068
Yoon Ah's dream happens to be
becoming a rapper.

828
00:44:59,068 --> 00:45:01,096
Rapper? With those skills?

829
00:45:01,096 --> 00:45:02,849
I was the one who told her to go for it.

830
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:04,134
I'm going nuts.

831
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,389
It was you who got her started.

832
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:09,771
Even if it is her dream,
that's not right.

833
00:45:09,771 --> 00:45:11,380
Stop it before it's too late.

834
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,141
Who knows what trouble she'll cause.

835
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:15,141
She's so serious about it.
I can't say anything.

836
00:45:15,141 --> 00:45:18,331
You figure that out. I'm going.

837
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,289
- Take a bagel.
- I'm fine.

838
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:26,603
<i>You, me, here, this,
noise, we, know. Woo!</i>

839
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:27,849
Oh, oh...

840
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:34,806
My Ji Soo was showing off
about her boyfriend so much.

841
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:36,615
I was curious about who he is.

842
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:40,378
You're handsome just like she said,
and very polite.

843
00:45:40,378 --> 00:45:41,778
You're too kind, Mother.

844
00:45:41,778 --> 00:45:43,788
Oh my, my. You're humble too.

845
00:45:43,788 --> 00:45:46,097
Thank you, Mother.

846
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:47,516
One moment.

847
00:45:47,516 --> 00:45:48,726
No problem at all.

848
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:50,516
Hello? Oh, really?

849
00:45:50,516 --> 00:45:52,268
Okay, I'll be there soon.

850
00:45:52,268 --> 00:45:54,759
Oh, what am I to do?

851
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:57,909
I have an urgent matter.
I think I have to go.

852
00:45:57,909 --> 00:46:00,277
- I'm sorry.
- I understand, Mother.

853
00:46:00,277 --> 00:46:02,068
Travel safely, Mother.

854
00:46:02,068 --> 00:46:03,596
- I'll see you again.
- Okay.

855
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:05,121
I am Lee Joon Ki!

856
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:15,391
I must've been nervous.
My legs were really tense.

857
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,978
How was I?

858
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,550
I think my mom really liked you.

859
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,789
Really?

860
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:26,585
Oh, good job, Lee Joon Ki.

861
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:28,914
- Why isn't she coming?
- Is someone else coming?

862
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:32,166
My younger sister finished work early,
so she said she'd come.

863
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:35,039
I'd better get prepared then.

864
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:37,998
- Sorry, Ji Soo.
- It's okay.

865
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:39,572
Joon Ki, say hello.

866
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:41,382
This is my younger sister, Ji Min.

867
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,190
My name is Lee Joon Ki.

868
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,500
Hello.

869
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:53,536
I'm the waxer who will
be waxing you today.

870
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:54,914
Why?

871
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:58,480
What is it?
Do you two know one another?

872
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,297
Well, actually...

873
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,820
What is it? Why can't you two speak?

874
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,920
You two didn't date in the past
or something, did you?

875
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,159
- No, no, no.
- Oh no.

876
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,889
Oh no. Not at all.

877
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:13,300
Then what is it? What is it, Ji Min?

878
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,163
You tell me.

879
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:21,057
Actually, your boyfriend
came to our store as a customer.

880
00:47:21,057 --> 00:47:22,945
Joon Ki did?

881
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:25,536
Joon Ki, you got a waxing?

882
00:47:25,536 --> 00:47:29,684
Well, it was... it was for a role.

883
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:32,445
- Work, work!
- Oh, is that all?

884
00:47:32,445 --> 00:47:35,688
As long as it wasn't you who did it.

885
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:41,510
What?

886
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,481
Don't tell me.

887
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:46,456
You did his waxing yourself?

888
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:47,648
Say no.

889
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:50,000
There were no male employees at the time.

890
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,371
Ji Soo, don't think much of it.
It's just work.

891
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,739
- Work.
- Work.

892
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:57,398
Work, work, work.

893
00:47:58,735 --> 00:48:00,364
Ji Soo, Ji Soo.

894
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:02,510
Wait. Ji Soo, Ji Soo!

895
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,806
Wait, wait!

896
00:48:04,806 --> 00:48:06,715
Ji Soo, I'm sorry.

897
00:48:06,715 --> 00:48:10,463
I never dreamed that
she was your little sister.

898
00:48:10,463 --> 00:48:12,978
I had to do it for this film.

899
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:15,248
I haven't even held your hand yet.

900
00:48:15,248 --> 00:48:20,065
- My sister has seen everything.
- Everything?

901
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:24,972
Well, that's just...

902
00:48:24,972 --> 00:48:28,938
It was all just for work, okay?

903
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:32,806
Okay, but I don't feel good about it.

904
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:34,329
I'm going to go home today.

905
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,541
Ji Soo, wait. Ji Soo...

906
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,565
Ji Soo!

907
00:48:38,565 --> 00:48:40,047
I'm going crazy here.

908
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:42,918
Why did she have to be
Ji Soo's younger sister? Why?

909
00:48:42,918 --> 00:48:44,753
My gosh!

910
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:52,177
- Are preparations going well?
- Yes.

911
00:48:52,177 --> 00:48:54,797
You haven't shot anything in a while.
Have you lost your touch?

912
00:48:54,797 --> 00:48:57,652
It's me. Kang Dong Gu.
You know I'm skilled.

913
00:48:57,652 --> 00:49:01,990
You should be making films.
Why are you doing this?

914
00:49:02,664 --> 00:49:04,443
Have you given up on films too?

915
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:06,913
No, I'm going back soon.

916
00:49:06,913 --> 00:49:08,628
I just need some money to do so.

917
00:49:08,628 --> 00:49:11,974
Yeah, don't give up like me.
Go all the way.

918
00:49:11,974 --> 00:49:14,820
- All right?
- Okay. Thanks.

919
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,072
Min Seo, stop crying.

920
00:49:18,072 --> 00:49:20,000
It's almost time for the party.

921
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,056
Excuse me.

922
00:49:21,056 --> 00:49:23,528
Are you just going to take pictures
when the baby's crying?

923
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,599
Pardon? What about his crying?

924
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,485
Other people make the baby laugh
when he cries.

925
00:49:28,485 --> 00:49:30,295
- Make him laugh!
- What?

926
00:49:30,295 --> 00:49:33,639
You want me to make him laugh?
I'm not a comedian.

927
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,666
Oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry.

928
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:38,586
It's his first day on the job.
I'm sorry.

929
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:40,211
One moment.

930
00:49:41,518 --> 00:49:43,717
Hey, what are you doing?

931
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:45,938
What do you expect me to do
about a crying baby?

932
00:49:45,938 --> 00:49:49,123
You have to be better at making
kids laugh than shooting the camera.

933
00:49:49,123 --> 00:49:50,704
Watch me.

934
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:57,297
Hey, Min Seo. Look at Uncle here.

935
00:50:09,536 --> 00:50:11,989
The baby is so cute.

936
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,489
Did you see that?
That's how you do it.

937
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:18,621
You try it.

938
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:20,271
You want me to do that?

939
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:22,378
Hey, you think making money's easy?

940
00:50:22,378 --> 00:50:24,692
You can quit if you don't want to do it.

941
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:27,826
Oh no. I'll do it.

942
00:50:27,826 --> 00:50:29,170
Do it properly.

943
00:50:29,788 --> 00:50:31,887
Do a good job.

944
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:54,411
Seo Jin, can you lend me your laptop?

945
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:55,463
What for?

946
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:57,981
I need to register
for something on the internet.

947
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:59,106
Register for what?

948
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:02,005
Oh, I'm going to go on
"Show Me the Money."

949
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:04,043
What? "Show Me the Money"?

950
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:07,378
I want to have my skills
evaluated by the pros.

951
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:11,376
Yoon Ah, isn't that a rash decision?

952
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:15,090
I know that my rap skills
aren't at a pro level yet.

953
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,623
However, I think I can overcome it.

954
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:21,766
The thing is, Yoon Ah...

955
00:51:21,766 --> 00:51:24,385
I didn't say anything to keep
your feelings from being hurt.

956
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:25,445
You really suck.

957
00:51:25,445 --> 00:51:27,237
What do you mean?

958
00:51:27,237 --> 00:51:29,577
It's total chaos, to put it simply.

959
00:51:29,577 --> 00:51:32,208
Is my rap that bad?

960
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:35,155
Honestly, most people can rap
about as well as you.

961
00:51:35,155 --> 00:51:37,936
I can do it too. You want to see?

962
00:51:37,936 --> 00:51:41,735
<i>Insomnia, lethargy,
the form of a zombie playing.</i>

963
00:51:41,735 --> 00:51:45,253
<i>Pour some water on it and
the heavy armor of reality comes off.</i>

964
00:51:45,253 --> 00:51:49,427
<i>Like flickers of fire that fall on feet,
it is beautiful.</i>

965
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:52,289
You see? You can see I'm better, right?

966
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:54,831
I see...

967
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:57,012
That's how it was.

968
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:58,751
Why didn't you say anything?

969
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:01,320
Yoon Ah, I'm sorry.

970
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,101
- I was worried you'd get hurt.
- It's fine.

971
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:05,880
I'm okay.

972
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,552
Don't worry about it.

973
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:15,865
Was I too harsh?

974
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:19,003
I shouldn't have gotten her excited.
This is driving me crazy.

975
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:22,900
Whatever, whatever.

976
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,003
Gosh, the noodles are soggy.

977
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:27,362
- I'm so hungry.
- You're home?

978
00:52:27,362 --> 00:52:29,443
What's with you? Did something happen?

979
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:31,418
Don't ask.

980
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:33,628
- Did you just make this?
- Yes.

981
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:35,456
Give me one bite.

982
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:42,248
No, make your own if you want one.

983
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:44,780
Didn't you eat with your
girlfriend's mom?

984
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,507
Something happened and I couldn't eat.
Just give me a bite.

985
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:51,563
No way. Make your own.

986
00:52:51,563 --> 00:52:54,922
So petty. Give me one bite.

987
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,545
You're going to grab it?

988
00:52:57,545 --> 00:53:01,253
Why are you so strong?
Do you lift weights?

989
00:53:01,253 --> 00:53:03,635
It's mine. I made it.

990
00:53:03,635 --> 00:53:05,708
Gosh. Forget it!

991
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:09,762
What a waste to spill it all.

992
00:53:09,762 --> 00:53:12,615
Ow, ow, ow!

993
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:26,148
Seo Jin, you!

994
00:53:26,148 --> 00:53:27,865
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

995
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:29,760
Doctor, my life as a man is over.

996
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,034
Doctor, Doctor! What do I do?

997
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:34,072
Lee Joon Ki is over!

998
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:35,940
Kang Seo Jin!

999
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:40,643
Seriously, Kang Seo Jin!

1000
00:53:40,643 --> 00:53:43,518
Doctor, what are you doing?
Do something for him.

1001
00:53:43,518 --> 00:53:46,733
I'm sorry. Page the doctor once more.

1002
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:49,672
She's coming down now.

1003
00:53:49,672 --> 00:53:50,974
What is it?

1004
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:53,135
Why are you paging someone
just out of surgery?

1005
00:53:53,135 --> 00:53:57,188
The intern doctor was too embarrassed
to see the patient.

1006
00:53:57,188 --> 00:53:59,731
Hey, you still call yourself a doctor?

1007
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:01,954
You'd better see me later.

1008
00:54:01,954 --> 00:54:05,300
What kind of patient is it?

1009
00:54:05,804 --> 00:54:07,791
Oh, Joon Ki?

1010
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:11,253
Who is it?

1011
00:54:11,253 --> 00:54:12,702
It's me, Ji Soo's mom.

1012
00:54:12,702 --> 00:54:15,945
Oh, Mom.
Please do something... oh my!

1013
00:54:18,567 --> 00:54:20,170
Mother.

1014
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,835
Mother, why are you here?

1015
00:54:21,835 --> 00:54:23,483
I'm a doctor here.

1016
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:25,936
What happened to you?

1017
00:54:25,936 --> 00:54:28,260
He spilled hot ramen.

1018
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,635
Oh no.

1019
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:32,603
Let me take a look.

1020
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,829
Wait. Mother.

1021
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:36,969
No, no. I'm fine now.

1022
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:38,190
I really am okay.

1023
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:41,427
I will head back home now.

1024
00:54:42,063 --> 00:54:45,039
You're not okay.
Where will you go in this state?

1025
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,851
No, I really am okay, Mother.

1026
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:52,639
Joon Ki, I am a doctor
before I'm Ji Soo's mom.

1027
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:54,599
- Nurse Kim, hold the patient down.
- Yes.

1028
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,322
Why are you holding me down? Where?

1029
00:54:56,322 --> 00:54:58,278
Ow! Why, why, why?

1030
00:54:58,278 --> 00:55:01,228
- Just stay still.
- No, no!

1031
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:04,699
Mother, Mother, Mother!
No, no, no!

1032
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:07,025
- I'll take a look.
- No!

1033
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:11,117
No! Don't do it! Stop!

1034
00:55:28,902 --> 00:55:31,822
Wait. What is this?

1035
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:35,833
Sorry.

1036
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:45,835
No wonder.

1037
00:55:45,835 --> 00:55:49,125
A burn this bad usually wouldn't
occur from spilled ramen.

1038
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,067
That was why.

1039
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:52,532
Yes.

1040
00:55:52,532 --> 00:55:55,402
Treatment went well.
You can go home.

1041
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:58,431
Thank you, Mother.

1042
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:05,021
Joon Ki.

1043
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:07,293
Oh... Ji Soo.

1044
00:56:07,293 --> 00:56:09,364
Oh, uh... you're here?

1045
00:56:09,364 --> 00:56:12,239
I have to go now. Goodbye.

1046
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,521
I'll be outside too.

1047
00:56:18,896 --> 00:56:20,193
Ji... Ji Soo.

1048
00:56:20,193 --> 00:56:23,503
Joon Ki, why are you doing this to me?

1049
00:56:23,503 --> 00:56:27,213
You got a waxing from my sister
and now my mom...

1050
00:56:27,213 --> 00:56:30,054
Were you going to expose yourself
to my whole family?

1051
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:33,003
How can I look at
my sister and mom again?

1052
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:35,264
- Ji Soo, it's not like that.
- Forget it.

1053
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:38,038
I don't want to hear it.
Let's break up.

1054
00:56:38,038 --> 00:56:40,501
What? Break up?

1055
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,349
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry.

1056
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:44,925
I don't think I can bear it.

1057
00:56:44,925 --> 00:56:46,927
Be well, Joon Ki.

1058
00:56:46,927 --> 00:56:48,456
Wait, Ji...

1059
00:56:48,456 --> 00:56:50,920
Ji Soo, Ji Soo.

1060
00:56:53,016 --> 00:56:55,583
Ji Soo, Ji Soo!

1061
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,289
Breathe.

1062
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,284
Ji Soo, Ji Soo!

1063
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,853
Ji Soo! Listen to me.

1064
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:06,751
Ji Soo! Ji Soo!

1065
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:18,541
<i>Three bears lived in a house.</i>

1066
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:23,226
<i>Daddy bear, mommy bear, and baby bear.</i>

1067
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:28,182
What are you doing?
He's crying even more.

1068
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:29,246
Is there anything else?

1069
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:31,358
Something else? I'll try again.

1070
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:00,556
Our baby, Min Seo.

1071
00:58:00,556 --> 00:58:03,166
Thank you so much
for coming into our lives.

1072
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:04,646
Happy birthday.

1073
00:58:04,646 --> 00:58:06,646
We love you forever.

1074
00:58:25,913 --> 00:58:30,407
So, you did that
until your head was bleeding?

1075
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:32,744
Ow.

1076
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,681
It was the only way to make him laugh.
What could I do?

1077
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:39,431
It's really hard to make a living.

1078
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:41,570
It's really hard.

1079
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:44,905
Ji Soo. Please listen to me, Ji Soo.

1080
00:58:44,905 --> 00:58:47,204
Don't hang up. Don't hang up, Ji Soo.

1081
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:48,835
I didn't do it on purpose.

1082
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:51,954
Just listen to me, Ji Soo. Ji Soo!

1083
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:55,581
She really wants to break up?

1084
00:58:55,581 --> 00:58:57,440
Yes.

1085
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,820
Why did you bother waxing?

1086
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:02,271
A minor actor like me
has to do what I'm told.

1087
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,661
What can I do?

1088
00:59:03,661 --> 00:59:08,284
You'll meet someone good.
Stay strong.

1089
00:59:08,284 --> 00:59:10,431
Breaking up with Ji Soo is one thing.

1090
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:14,019
I wonder if I'll end up
playing minor roles forever.

1091
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:15,505
I feel weak thinking about it.

1092
00:59:15,505 --> 00:59:18,126
Why would you say something like that?

1093
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:22,101
The actor Hwang Jung Min was an
unknown actor for 10 years.

1094
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:24,527
Kwak Do Won was unknown for 20 years.

1095
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:27,577
So, you're saying I should be
unknown for 20 years?

1096
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:31,829
I'm saying if you work hard,
you can be like them too.

1097
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:35,608
You are a pretty decent actor, after all.

1098
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:38,010
I can act pretty well.

1099
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,903
People do know that.

1100
00:59:40,903 --> 00:59:42,539
Yeah.

1101
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:44,235
Let's keep our hopes up.

1102
00:59:44,235 --> 00:59:47,297
Then we'll have a day when the sun
shines bright for us too.

1103
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:49,338
Yes, of course.

1104
00:59:49,338 --> 00:59:52,565
In order to stay strong,
let's eat first.

1105
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:54,126
I'm so hungry.

1106
00:59:54,126 --> 00:59:55,396
What's with you?

1107
00:59:55,396 --> 00:59:57,094
When aren't you hungry?

1108
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,836
Tell me. Tell me now.

1109
00:59:58,836 --> 01:00:00,476
Oh, muffins!

1110
01:00:02,242 --> 01:00:04,664
You can just have these for dinner.

1111
01:00:04,664 --> 01:00:08,295
I don't feel like grocery shopping,
so I just made these.

1112
01:00:08,295 --> 01:00:11,315
Yoon Ah, are you still angry?

1113
01:00:11,315 --> 01:00:13,204
No, I'm not angry.

1114
01:00:13,204 --> 01:00:16,563
I'm in a great mood. I feel like flying.

1115
01:00:16,563 --> 01:00:18,903
Okay, so you're not angry.

1116
01:00:18,903 --> 01:00:20,463
You're not angry.

1117
01:00:24,936 --> 01:00:27,739
Oh, you made these?

1118
01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:30,934
Why? Can you bake as well as I can?

1119
01:00:30,934 --> 01:00:33,724
Ah, everyone in the world
can bake as well as I can.

1120
01:00:33,724 --> 01:00:36,074
No, it's really delicious.

1121
01:00:36,074 --> 01:00:38,389
Guys, try it. Try it.

1122
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:40,007
Shall we?

1123
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,541
Wow.

1124
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:48,112
It's really good.

1125
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:50,172
Yoon Ah, you made these yourself?

1126
01:00:50,172 --> 01:00:52,635
These are better than
muffins from the bakery.

1127
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:54,838
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

1128
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:56,250
They are.

1129
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,472
Yoon Ah, why don't you become
patisseur instead a rapper?

1130
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:01,630
A patisseur?

1131
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,157
To tell you the truth,
becoming a patisseur is my second dream.

1132
01:01:05,157 --> 01:01:07,802
Really? Then become a patisseur.

1133
01:01:07,802 --> 01:01:08,913
Should I?

1134
01:01:08,913 --> 01:01:11,340
But, I still like
rapping a little more...

1135
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,010
- Yoon Ah.
- All right.

1136
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,351
I was joking.

1137
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:16,913
- Is it really good?
- Yeah.

1138
01:01:16,913 --> 01:01:19,244
- Patisseur, patisseur.
- It's very good.

1139
01:01:19,244 --> 01:01:21,278
- Really?
- You have a specialty, Yoon Ah.

1140
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:22,324
Is it good?

1141
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:33,771
Good, good. Very real.

1142
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:38,864
Oh, yeah. I like it. Very good.

1143
01:01:38,864 --> 01:01:41,367
See, you got a clean wax.

1144
01:01:41,367 --> 01:01:43,579
You look so real and good.

1145
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:47,114
Thank you. I will do my best.

1146
01:01:47,114 --> 01:01:50,648
What's that? You did your armpits too?

1147
01:01:50,648 --> 01:01:52,934
Good job.

1148
01:01:54,184 --> 01:01:55,829
It worked.

1149
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:57,728
What a shock.

1150
01:01:57,728 --> 01:02:00,161
Hey, did you really?

1151
01:02:00,161 --> 01:02:03,137
- You even shaved you head?
- Yes, Director.

1152
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:07,438
I don't need hair if you want to
make the film look real.

1153
01:02:07,438 --> 01:02:10,005
Very good. It's great.

1154
01:02:10,005 --> 01:02:11,809
This is how an actor should be!

1155
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:14,219
Director, Soo Hyun is here.

1156
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:16,469
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.

1157
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:18,652
It's cold, so cold.

1158
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,059
Let's film it quickly.

1159
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:22,121
Soo Hyun, you didn't get a waxing?

1160
01:02:22,121 --> 01:02:24,556
You know I get cold easily.

1161
01:02:24,556 --> 01:02:26,324
I'd get cold without
body hair and get sick.

1162
01:02:26,324 --> 01:02:30,762
Still, this is about a swimmer.
You just don't look real.

1163
01:02:30,762 --> 01:02:35,322
Hey, I'm playing the role of a swimmer.
I'm not an actual swimmer.

1164
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:38,873
If you insist upon it,
cast someone else.

1165
01:02:38,873 --> 01:02:40,449
No, no, no.

1166
01:02:40,449 --> 01:02:42,891
What's so important about accuracy?

1167
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:44,356
Let's just go with it.

1168
01:02:44,356 --> 01:02:46,853
Why do these people look so smooth?

1169
01:02:46,853 --> 01:02:48,702
I stick out too much.

1170
01:02:48,702 --> 01:02:51,873
I'll get insulted for it later.
I can't film like this.

1171
01:02:51,873 --> 01:02:56,083
Oh, you're right.
What should we do?

1172
01:02:56,083 --> 01:03:00,204
We'll start the cheering scene.
Lots of emotion!

1173
01:03:00,204 --> 01:03:02,420
Make it real, okay?

1174
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,666
Yes!

1175
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:06,976
Ready... action!

1176
01:03:06,976 --> 01:03:11,175
Woo! You can do it!

1177
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,869
Go get it! Good luck!

1178
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:17,630
Korea!

1179
01:03:18,764 --> 01:03:20,780
Korea!

1180
01:03:21,615 --> 01:03:23,833
Korea!

1181
01:03:24,987 --> 01:03:26,382
Korea!

1182
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:28,246
Korea...

1183
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:30,592
Korea!

1184
01:03:30,592 --> 01:03:33,693
Korea...
