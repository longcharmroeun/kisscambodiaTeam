1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,310
Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

2
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:15,719
You can't go in there. It's dangerous.

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,621
Get out of my way. There's someone I know in the building.

4
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:18,822
Like I said, it's really dangerous!

5
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:20,624
It doesn't matter! Just get out of my way!

6
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:22,392
Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

7
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:23,893
Yoon Ah!

8
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:25,795
Dong Gu?

9
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,538
What are you doing here? Is everything okay?

10
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:46,850
What's going on, Dong Gu?

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,152
Did you get hurt?

12
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:51,321
You are okay, right?

13
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,389
Yes, I am.

14
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:57,127
Dong Gu, I'm sorry, but can you please let me go?

15
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:02,565
Dong Gu,

16
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,634
are you here because you were worried about me?

17
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,837
What? It's because...

18
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,874
I mean, I was worried about our neighbors, you know.

19
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:12,309
And then I saw you were here too.

20
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:15,011
Why did you hug me then?

21
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:16,313
That's because...

22
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:21,184
I love to hug people when I'm worried about them.

23
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:24,921
Ma'am!

24
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,690
Are you okay? Is everything going all right?

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,224
Why are you like this, Mr. Kang?

26
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,495
Sir, are you okay?

27
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:36,499
Mr. Policeman, are you okay? I interfered your duty last time.

28
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:37,500
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,169
Mr. Fireman, are you okay?

30
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:41,271
Mr. Kim!

31
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,506
I really appreciate your work!

32
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,410
Look at you.

33
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:51,147
Your heart was actually in a bad condition. How could it be a fate?

34
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:52,515
You can stop now.

35
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:54,584
I'm really worried about myself now.

36
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:57,387
Right. What's going on now?

37
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:59,656
I broke a plate and got hurt a little bit.

38
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:01,491
You should be careful.

39
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,259
By the way, where's Dong Gu?

40
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:06,463
I don't know. He just ran out like a mad person.

41
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:08,932
Oh, did you know there was a fire at the grocery shop?

42
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:10,133
- What? - What?

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,302
- The grocery shop near us? - Yes.

44
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,239
Yoon Ah was going to buy groceries earlier. I hope she's okay.

45
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:17,474
Yoon Ah?

46
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:20,176
Call her now. Right now!

47
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:21,277
We are home.

48
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:24,247
Are you okay? I heard there was a fire.

49
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:25,382
I'm okay.

50
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:28,051
I went to get some fried chicken on my way to the grocery shop.

51
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:29,285
I think that's when the grocery shop caught fire.

52
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:30,320
Oh, I see.

53
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:31,821
I'm glad you were not there.

54
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:35,425
So I heard you ran out like a mad person.

55
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,026
It was because of Yoon Ah.

56
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:39,629
It wasn't.

57
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:43,066
I saw the neighbors on the news. So I was really worried.

58
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,935
You know the president of the women's society is my best friend.

59
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:47,237
- Since when? - What?

60
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:49,639
It's been that way for a while.

61
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,510
I was worried if something's going to happen to my best friend.

62
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,745
I was so worried!

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,855
I must be crazy.

64
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,657
I must really like her.

65
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:10,427
I must be out of my mind. I'm crazy.

66
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:11,928
Why did I go there?

67
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:15,832
Dong Gu, have some fried chicken with us.

68
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,734
Forget it.

69
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,136
I'm not in the mood.

70
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:21,337
Come on.

71
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,207
Come eat with us.

72
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,144
I said I didn't want to.

73
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,184
Then I'll leave some for you. Eat it later.

74
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,398
I must be crazy. I'm completely out of my mind.

75
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:50,700
Why did she grab me?

76
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:53,136
My goodness.

77
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,438
What should I do?

78
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,374
That's mine.

79
00:03:58,374 --> 00:03:59,476
I'm already eating it.

80
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:00,844
Gosh.

81
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:03,546
- Where is Dong Gu? - He doesn't want to eat.

82
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:04,948
Is something bothering him?

83
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:07,083
He's lying in bed with a blanket pulled over his head.

84
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,385
What? With a blanket pulled over his head?

85
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,754
He's become sulky again.

86
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:15,391
He'd stay sulky for days as a kid too. Don't worry about it too much.

87
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,729
Sol is up.

88
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,197
Go ahead and eat.

89
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,101
What are you doing?

90
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:28,171
You already ate a drumstick. Are you going to eat the other too?

91
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,707
Well... I don't like lean parts.

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,176
Still, you shouldn't eat both drumsticks.

93
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,944
How can you be so shameless?

94
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:36,980
What's the big deal?

95
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,715
Fine. I won't eat it.

96
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:40,183
- All right. - I'll eat it.

97
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,552
- What? - Wait.

98
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,421
She took the drumstick in the end.

99
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:48,825
She's so unbelievably shameless.

100
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,895
Seo Jin, I have to pay my credit card bills.

101
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:53,096
Can you lend me some money?

102
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,331
I have no money at all.

103
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:58,067
Are you proud of that?

104
00:04:58,268 --> 00:04:59,802
What are you watching, by the way?

105
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,772
Is that an eating show?

106
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:05,141
Why would you watch something like that?

107
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:07,176
- It's fun. - Fun, my foot.

108
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,279
I don't understand those people.

109
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,447
Why would you broadcast yourself eating?

110
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:13,683
They're pathetic.

111
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:15,718
Pathetic?

112
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:19,722
Do you know how much money these BJs make?

113
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:23,259
Popular BJs can even earn a six-figure salary.

114
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,794
Six-figure?

115
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:26,896
They earn a six-figure salary by eating?

116
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:28,064
Yes, a six-figure salary.

117
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,705
Six-figure...

118
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:38,641
Where is Du Shik's laptop?

119
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:44,581
You're back.

120
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,282
Du Shik, where is your laptop?

121
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:47,350
The other day...

122
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:49,185
What happened to you?

123
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:53,923
Well... Some jerks were messing with Mal Geum.

124
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:54,991
What?

125
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:58,394
And? You got in a fight with them?

126
00:05:58,661 --> 00:05:59,929
A gentle person like you?

127
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:03,166
When I saw Mal Geum crying, I just lost it.

128
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,969
I don't know why I did that.

129
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,403
You don't know why?

130
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:09,205
It's because you like Mal Geum.

131
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,141
- You think so? - Of course.

132
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:14,978
Why would you get beaten up for a girl you don't even like?

133
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:19,015
Just tell her how you feel about her.

134
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,452
Tell her? It's too early.

135
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,988
Timing is everything when it comes to love.

136
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:28,257
Sometimes, you can lose someone by being one second late.

137
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,126
While you hesitate,

138
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:33,029
another guy can take her away. What would you do if that happens?

139
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,198
What? I don't want that to happen.

140
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:37,867
How should I tell her?

141
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,469
What do you think?

142
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:42,238
Guys should always go straight ahead and be tough.

143
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:43,706
Go straight ahead and be tough?

144
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:45,508
So exactly how?

145
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,210
You're such an amateur.

146
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:51,414
Pay attention.

147
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,083
There was a man called Lee Jun Ki.

148
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:55,718
He's like this.

149
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,354
When he likes a girl, he starts walking.

150
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,823
He walks straight ahead. He keeps walking.

151
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:02,358
As the earth is round, he'll meet the girl eventually.

152
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,927
Then he stops in front of her.

153
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:07,263
And then? Be confident.

154
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:09,098
Grab her arm.

155
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,034
Push her against the wall.

156
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:14,904
And tell her.

157
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:16,406
How? Like this.

158
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,108
"Because it's a good day..."

159
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,244
"because it's a bad day..."

160
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:23,813
- "I'm sorry." - What?

161
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,981
"I love you."

162
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:28,084
"Do I like you?"

163
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:29,318
What are you guys doing now?

164
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:30,987
Are you in love?

165
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:33,690
No. What are you talking about?

166
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:36,959
Don't be absurd. Gosh.

167
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:40,463
Carry on.

168
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:43,433
Go on a date and get married if you want.

169
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,601
Gosh.

170
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:48,638
What do you mean by this?

171
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:50,673
What is with you?

172
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,710
Keep walking.

173
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,814
When are they going to grow up?

174
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:00,416
I already have enough problems.

175
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:03,252
- Dong Gu, you're up. - Gosh.

176
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:05,455
Why are you so startled?

177
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,891
I'm not. My goodness.

178
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:11,027
You must be hungry.

179
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,429
I'll warm up some leftover chicken.

180
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:24,607
I like her?

181
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:26,109
Why?

182
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:29,145
It's not like she is good at what she does, pretty,

183
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:30,513
or cute.

184
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:40,389
She is cute.

185
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,091
She is cute.

186
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:44,761
Has she always been this cute?

187
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:47,730
Why are you staring at me?

188
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,302
I wasn't staring at you. You're being silly.

189
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:57,907
Why are you being so grumpy?

190
00:08:58,207 --> 00:08:59,976
Are you angry at me?

191
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,944
No.

192
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:03,780
Then what is it?

193
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:07,817
Is it...

194
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:15,391
Is it because of the stain on your camera bag?

195
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:17,827
How did you know...

196
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,265
Was it you?

197
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:25,368
I spilled some sauce while cooking.

198
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:27,170
Don't worry. That's not it.

199
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,272
Is it because of the broken camera lid?

200
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:30,606
How did you know...

201
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,376
Did you break it?

202
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:37,713
I stepped on it while trying to remove the stain.

203
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,617
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,389
Please stop being angry at me, will you?

205
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:47,790
Will you?

206
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,360
Stop being angry at me. I'm sorry.

207
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,663
- I'm sorry. - I said, I'm not angry at you.

208
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:56,566
Dong Gu!

209
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:01,070
What should I do? He looks really angry.

210
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:09,979
She's cute.

211
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,981
She's really cute.

212
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,785
I almost forgave her for things she didn't even do.

213
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:19,655
How could she apologize in such a cute way?

214
00:10:24,427 --> 00:10:25,528
Gosh.

215
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,030
Dong Gu, what are you doing here?

216
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:29,232
What?

217
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:30,867
Nothing.

218
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:32,835
Maybe I should clean up.

219
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,072
What's with him?

220
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,441
Why is he blushing?

221
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,716
(0 viewers)

222
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,653
Jun Ki, can I borrow your razor?

223
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:51,854
My goodness.

224
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,624
Is that the only thing you want to borrow from me?

225
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,392
Mine is broken.

226
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:57,593
It's in there.

227
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,861
What are you doing?

228
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:00,396
I'm thinking of starting an eating show.

229
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,631
I have to pay credit card bills.

230
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:04,567
You want to make money by hosting an eating show?

231
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,569
Do you think that's easy?

232
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:09,005
Don't worry.

233
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:11,073
When it comes to eating, I'm as good as anyone.

234
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,144
But there's no viewer yet. It's driving me crazy.

235
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:19,415
Wait, I have a viewer now.

236
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,085
Hi, Gangnam Rich.

237
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:28,057
I'm the handsome, new rising star in the eating show world.

238
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:30,359
BJ Jun Ki here.

239
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:33,262
Cut it out. Start eating.

240
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,564
Okay.

241
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:39,402
You seem to be a bit impatient.

242
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:43,839
Why is he so rude?

243
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,544
Gangnam Rich,

244
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:51,414
let me start eating fried chicken.

245
00:11:58,154 --> 00:11:59,288
It tastes good.

246
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,994
- It's so crispy. - Gosh, that looks disgusting.

247
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:10,833
The thing is, this is my first time.

248
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:15,471
Gangnam Rich,

249
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,506
let me try again.

250
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,280
Oh, no.

251
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,917
So delicious.

252
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:35,358
Dong Gu, how did it go at the party?

253
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:37,360
Dong Gu.

254
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:39,161
What's with him?

255
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:42,598
Well... I think...

256
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:45,501
- he is angry at me. - What?

257
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,270
I spilled some sauce on his camera bag...

258
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:49,772
and broke his camera lens cap.

259
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:53,075
What? You should have been careful.

260
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,846
His camera is his treasure.

261
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:59,615
Really? What should I do?

262
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:03,753
Do you know how I can make him feel better?

263
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,622
Let me think. Oh, right.

264
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:08,858
- There's one way. - What is it?

265
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:09,925
Acting cute.

266
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,727
He may seem brusque,

267
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:13,396
but he falls for acting cute.

268
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:14,930
Acting cute?

269
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:26,175
I can't even look at her face.

270
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:29,545
She gets cuter the more I look at her.

271
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,947
Dong Gu.

272
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:34,216
Dong Gu.

273
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,719
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,754
Please forgive me.

275
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:41,023
Please? Come on.

276
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:51,467
What's this?

277
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,769
What's wrong with him?

278
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,539
It's because you aren't cute at all.

279
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:59,708
He usually falls for people who act cute.

280
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,078
You're bad at acting cute.

281
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:03,112
Really?

282
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:05,448
I tried my best.

283
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,450
Wasn't I cute at all?

284
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:10,820
She's so cute. Way too cute.

285
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:12,421
Her sounding like a baby is cute.

286
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:16,025
When she shook her shoulders, I thought my heart would stop.

287
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:19,528
You startled me.

288
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:21,797
What are you doing here?

289
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:24,033
What? Nothing.

290
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,669
Is there something you want to tell me?

291
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,605
No.

292
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:36,145
What's going on with him since yesterday?

293
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,848
Do you feel better?

294
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:41,317
Look at your lips.

295
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:43,752
They're chapped.

296
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,088
Those jerks.

297
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:48,891
It's okay. I'm fine, so don't worry.

298
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:51,427
The shoot starts tomorrow.

299
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:53,395
You'll get busy soon, right?

300
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,597
I think so.

301
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:59,902
Did I exercise excessively today?

302
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,971
What kind of exercise do you do?

303
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,472
It's called Krav Maga.

304
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:05,941
It's so much fun that I lose track of time.

305
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,843
Krav... I see.

306
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:12,681
Goodness.

307
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:15,217
I don't feel courageous enough to confess to her.

308
00:15:15,217 --> 00:15:18,721
That's right. Men must be direct and forward.

309
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:20,422
Do it like a man.

310
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,191
Mal Geum.

311
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:24,059
Yes?

312
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:37,540
Gosh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

313
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,311
I'm okay.

314
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:44,980
What did you just do?

315
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:46,715
How did you do it?

316
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:49,552
It's Krav Maga, a martial arts for real situations.

317
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:51,153
Won Bin did it in "The Man from Nowhere".

318
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:54,356
Is Krav Maga a martial arts, not something like pilates?

319
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:57,393
Yes, so don't grab my arm suddenly.

320
00:15:57,393 --> 00:15:58,861
My body reacts automatically.

321
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:01,764
What? Okay.

322
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,071
Hello?

323
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:10,906
Yes, sir.

324
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:13,576
I'll be right there. See you.

325
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:18,814
I have a fan meeting today, so I have to go. I'm sorry.

326
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:21,317
Do you have fan meetings too?

327
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:23,552
May I come too?

328
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:24,620
What?

329
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:26,155
I don't think...

330
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:27,723
I have something to tell you.

331
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,563
- Cherry. - Cherry.

332
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,265
We're here. This is it.

333
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:37,633
I see.

334
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,335
Good luck at your fan meeting.

335
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,003
I'll wait at a nearby cafe.

336
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:43,072
Writer Hong?

337
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:44,673
Hello, sir.

338
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:46,909
What brings you here?

339
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:50,079
Are you here for Cherry's fan meeting?

340
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,413
Pardon me? No...

341
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,782
I'm glad that you came. Come with me.

342
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:55,517
I'll take you to the best seat.

343
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,086
No, that's not why...

344
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:12,268
Cherry's fan meeting will start now.

345
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:15,771
Please welcome and shout for Cherry.

346
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,407
(Cherry's Fan Meeting)

347
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:23,245
- Cherry. - Cherry.

348
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,980
We love you.

349
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,749
- Cherry. - Cherry.

350
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:28,217
(Cherry's Fan Meeting)

351
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:35,724
- Cherry. - Cherry.

352
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:49,438
Look, do you see the bone?

353
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:50,606
(BJ Jun Ki Eats Chicken.)

354
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:51,974
Once again...

355
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:54,243
Once again, it's cleared.

356
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,278
Here is...

357
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,213
the second plate of chicken.

358
00:17:58,213 --> 00:18:00,215
Before I eat the second plate,

359
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:02,685
you may send me...

360
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:04,453
star candies if you'd like.

361
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,488
It's time for star candies.

362
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:12,895
Okay, I guess there aren't any. Thank you.

363
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:17,132
Now, I'll eat the second plate of chicken.

364
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,202
Wait, don't throw it away.

365
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:24,707
Do you mean this?

366
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:27,242
It's the first plate that I finished.

367
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:29,345
These are chicken bones.

368
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,981
If you eat the bones, I'll give you 100 star candies.

369
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,986
What? If I eat the bones,

370
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:40,189
you'll give me 100 star candies?

371
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,428
Hey, I'm on air.

372
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,032
What are you thinking?

373
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:51,767
Are you going to eat them?

374
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:52,835
Of course.

375
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:55,170
100 star candies are worth 10 dollars.

376
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,439
You still can't eat chicken bones.

377
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,907
I have to pay my credit card bills.

378
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:00,976
To avoid having bad credit, I'm willing to eat...

379
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,945
chicken feathers too. Do you get it?

380
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:06,248
- It could kill you. - Let me go.

381
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,083
Yes.

382
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,651
I'm sorry that I kept you waiting.

383
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,754
Wolfman kept bothering me.

384
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:14,223
Now, I'll start eating chicken bones...

385
00:19:14,556 --> 00:19:17,426
on "BJ Jun Ki Eats Chicken."

386
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,696
Gosh, it smells like calcium and magnesium.

387
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:22,664
It makes me feel healthy. It's great.

388
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:23,932
Here I go.

389
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,203
Gosh.

390
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:41,450
Goodness, he really ate the bone.

391
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,318
How is it possible?

392
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,220
Isn't he embarrassed of himself?

393
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:47,723
Let's study hard so that...

394
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:49,324
we don't grow up to be like him.

395
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:54,062
Look. See?

396
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:55,697
I swallowed it.

397
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:58,000
Come on, Mr. Rich.

398
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,635
Give me star candies.

399
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:02,604
Okay, I will.

400
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,242
(100 star candies from Gangnam Rich)

401
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:08,377
100.

402
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:10,512
Thank you, Mr. Rich.

403
00:20:10,846 --> 00:20:14,216
Thank you so much, sir.

404
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:16,452
I love you, sir.

405
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:17,786
I got 100.

406
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:33,202
He'll cause trouble again soon.

407
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:35,404
What?

408
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,139
What are you doing here?

409
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:39,708
What? Well, I...

410
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:45,347
Is he still upset at you?

411
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,683
Didn't you do what I taught you?

412
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:49,351
I haven't sent it yet.

413
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:51,153
It always works.

414
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:53,989
I've never seen anyone who stays upset after seeing it.

415
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:55,090
Really?

416
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,126
Okay, I'll send it.

417
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,194
Okay.

418
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,500
I can't eat properly because of her. Goodness.

419
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,472
It's from Yoon Ah. What is it?

420
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:13,208
- Do you want to be forgiven? - Yes.

421
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:14,877
Ask for forgiveness.

422
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,880
Dong Gu, please forgive me.

423
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,315
- Make it cute. - Please forgive me.

424
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:21,517
Make it lovely.

425
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:23,452
Please forgive me.

426
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:24,453
Make it cute.

427
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:26,455
Please forgive me.

428
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:27,489
Make it strong.

429
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:28,891
Please forgive me.

430
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:33,929
Is he upset?

431
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:35,597
What's going on?

432
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:42,905
What am I doing in the middle of shooting?

433
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:44,840
Are you eating noodles?

434
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,875
It looks delicious.

435
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:49,077
Hey, hey.

436
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:50,145
That's my medicine.

437
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:52,514
It's medicine for heart problems.

438
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:54,683
- Dong Gu. - What's going on?

439
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:56,552
I think he's still upset.

440
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:57,853
Let's give up.

441
00:21:58,487 --> 00:22:00,389
You have no talent in acting cute.

442
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:01,823
You're terrible.

443
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:05,527
Is my acting cute that bad?

444
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:12,801
She's too cute.

445
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:14,269
Is she human or a doll?

446
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,138
Thank goodness for the medicine.

447
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:18,740
Otherwise, I'd have died of a heart attack.

448
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:20,776
Dong Gu.

449
00:22:21,343 --> 00:22:22,978
What's been going on with you?

450
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:24,413
Say what you want to tell me.

451
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:25,447
I have...

452
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:27,149
nothing to say.

453
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:31,920
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

454
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:34,957
Hold on.

455
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:38,193
Does he still...

456
00:22:39,661 --> 00:22:40,929
like me?

457
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:44,733
It's time for the event's highlight. We'll give out prizes.

458
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:48,770
Let me introduce today's special prize.

459
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:49,871
- What is it? - What is it?

460
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:51,173
Today's prize is...

461
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,041
from Cherry's main work.

462
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,843
It's the bikini...

463
00:22:54,843 --> 00:22:58,080
that Cherry wore on "Bikini Investigation Unit 3".

464
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:05,220
(My girl, Cherry)

465
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:07,990
Everyone, please calm down.

466
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:11,660
Please raise your numbers that you received at the door.

467
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:15,697
Cherry will draw your number.

468
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:18,834
("Bikini Investigation Unit 3" Cherry Fan Meeting)

469
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,845
- Please say 30! - Cherry!

470
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,182
The lucky person who's going to get Cherry's bikini is...

471
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:36,218
number 38!

472
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:41,289
Did anyone get number 38?

473
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:43,191
Who is that?

474
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:44,226
Where is he?

475
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:46,294
- Did no one get 38? - Who's that?

476
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,562
- No one has that number. - There's no 38!

477
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:48,630
Number 38?

478
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:55,604
- No one has that number! - What's my number?

479
00:23:56,304 --> 00:24:00,075
- Do it again! - Do it again!

480
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:04,312
- Number 38 is here! - Yes!

481
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:07,783
He was right there!

482
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:09,584
- 38! - Let's bring him to the stage.

483
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,653
- 38! - Congratulations!

484
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:13,422
Let's give him a round of applause!

485
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:26,768
(Congratulations on winning the bikini.)

486
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:30,939
Hello!

487
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:33,809
BJ Jun Ki eats...

488
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:37,279
all kinds of bones today!

489
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,650
I prepared various kinds of bones.

490
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,951
I'll start from here.

491
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:45,387
First of all, this is chicken bone.

492
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:48,590
This is pork backbone.

493
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,760
This is rib bone.

494
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:54,362
This is rockfish bone.

495
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:56,832
And this is hairtail bone.

496
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,500
That's what I have today.

497
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,802
Today's highlight is...

498
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:07,576
pig feet bone!

499
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:09,211
That's the best part of today's show.

500
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:12,748
First, I'll try the bone that's known as chewy and sharp.

501
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:16,418
It's rockfish bone.

502
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:17,853
Here I go!

503
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:26,194
He must be crazy. How can he even...

504
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:51,553
Dong Gu, Dong Gu!

505
00:25:56,124 --> 00:25:57,692
You can give it to me. I'll do it.

506
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:00,862
I'll do it. You can go back, Yoon Ah.

507
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:02,464
But I can do it.

508
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:04,566
Dong Gu,

509
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,135
are you still upset at me?

510
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:10,772
I said I'm not upset at you. You can stop asking me about that.

511
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,776
Then why are you like this to me? You can tell me.

512
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:21,383
See? You're not telling me anything.

513
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,819
You must be upset at me because of the camera.

514
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:24,986
Yes, you're right.

515
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:27,455
I was upset at you because of the camera.

516
00:26:27,722 --> 00:26:29,191
But I'm fine now.

517
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:32,160
So you don't have to worry about it anymore, okay?

518
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:33,395
Really?

519
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:35,764
I'm glad to hear that.

520
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:38,366
I've been worried so much about it for the last few days.

521
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:42,170
I will never make that kind of mistake again.

522
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:50,145
- Seriously... - I'm sorry.

523
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:53,949
I have a cold.

524
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:55,717
It's okay. I'm fine.

525
00:26:56,818 --> 00:27:00,589
Look how thin your coat is. That's why you have a cold now.

526
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:03,158
This is the thickest one I have.

527
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:05,393
It's pretty warm too.

528
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:08,763
Oh, I left the stove on.

529
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:10,732
I should go back in.

530
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:21,476
(BJ Jun Ki Eats All Kinds of Bones.)

531
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:22,978
(Gangnam Rich sent 10 star candies.)

532
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:24,412
(I sent you some star candies.)

533
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,949
Thank you so much, Gangnam Rich.

534
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:29,651
(Hur Lee Gye In Venus sent 20 star candies.)

535
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:32,587
Thank you, Hur Lee Gye In Venus!

536
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:36,491
You guys are showing me so much support.

537
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:40,262
BJ Jun Ki doesn't know what to do.

538
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:41,496
Thank you!

539
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:45,734
Thanks to your star candies,

540
00:27:46,868 --> 00:27:48,403
it's time to eat the strongest bone,

541
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:53,975
pig feet bone.

542
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:59,748
(If you finish that, I'll give you 200 star candies.)

543
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:06,588
I'm fine!

544
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:10,058
I'll start eating this.

545
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,028
My stomach...

546
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:15,363
I'm...

547
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:17,499
I'm fine!

548
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,234
(I can't send you star candies then.)

549
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:22,938
Oh, my goodness.

550
00:28:30,378 --> 00:28:32,814
Why did I have to be the winner?

551
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:34,916
I cannot even throw it away. I don't really know what to do.

552
00:28:40,355 --> 00:28:42,057
I'm sorry. Did you wait for a long time?

553
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:43,258
I'm okay.

554
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,327
Aren't you cold? Drink this.

555
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:48,897
Thank you.

556
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,238
Didn't you feel a bit embarrassed today?

557
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:01,309
I'm sorry. It's just how my life is these days.

558
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:03,078
What are you talking about?

559
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:07,849
I didn't want to do this kind of work from the beginning.

560
00:29:08,817 --> 00:29:12,387
At first, I was in dramas and films too.

561
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,458
But things didn't work out great, and I needed money too.

562
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:19,627
I was going to do it just once. And then somehow, I'm here.

563
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,364
What's so bad about an adult movie actress?

564
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:24,399
But my dream isn't this.

565
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:29,237
I want to be in dramas and films like I used to.

566
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,607
But I've been branded,

567
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:34,709
so I don't get any other roles.

568
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:38,179
Maybe you can quit it now.

569
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,117
I can't quit it yet because of my contract.

570
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:47,288
I really don't know what I should do.

571
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:52,427
I'm sorry.

572
00:29:52,827 --> 00:29:55,130
This is stupid. I cry so much these days.

573
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:57,198
By the way,

574
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:59,267
didn't you want to say something to me?

575
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:02,937
No, I can tell you about it next time.

576
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:04,939
Just have your tea.

577
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:15,216
So how am I going to give this to her?

578
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,520
Here you go.

579
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,988
That's not it!

580
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:21,656
I found it on the street.

581
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:23,725
That doesn't sound good at all!

582
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,928
Why did I even buy this?

583
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,266
What if she finds out I like her?

584
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:35,637
Are you okay?

585
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,439
Be careful.

586
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:40,809
What's wrong with him? What's going on?

587
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,477
Well...

588
00:30:42,877 --> 00:30:45,280
We went to the emergency room because Jun Ki got sick.

589
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:46,548
Emergency room?

590
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:47,649
What's wrong with him?

591
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:48,917
Please don't tell her.

592
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,920
- He ate rockfish bones. - Please...

593
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:53,988
Rockfish bones?

594
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:56,958
Did you eat those bones again?

595
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,059
No...

596
00:31:00,128 --> 00:31:02,597
I'll go clean the room first.

597
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:03,898
Okay.

598
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,868
Why did I even buy this? I'm so stupid!

599
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:11,506
Dong Gu, were you home?

600
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,408
What? Yes, I was.

601
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:15,977
What are you hiding?

602
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:18,146
It's just...

603
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:23,818
Yoon Ah, take this.

604
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:27,088
You are so heavy.

605
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:28,756
- Why are there so many people? - What are you doing, Dong Gu?

606
00:31:29,157 --> 00:31:31,559
What's that? Did you buy that for Yoon Ah?

607
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:34,028
No, I didn't.

608
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:36,698
I was going to tell her to give it to Soo Ah. Well, Soo Ah's here now.

609
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:37,799
Soo Ah, here you go.

610
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,436
What is this?

611
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:44,606
Is this a coat?

612
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:45,807
Why are you giving it to me all of a sudden?

613
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:48,009
I thought it was pretty.

614
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:50,745
Guys, I'm sick now.

615
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:54,048
Can you guys put me on the bed first and talk about that later?

616
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:56,985
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's go.

617
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,888
Why are you so heavy?

618
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:02,657
I didn't even turn off my show.

619
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,329
- What's going on? - Gosh.

620
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:10,098
He's back.

621
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:11,766
- Did he go to the hospital? - The Beard Girl is here!

622
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:13,368
- This is interesting. - What is this?

623
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,336
Why? What's so surprising?

624
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:18,339
Oh, my goodness! Take a look at this!

625
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:21,509
- What happened? - Why are there so many viewers?

626
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:25,079
23,400 star candies?

627
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,515
- 23... - Each star is worth 10 cents,

628
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:29,918
so it's worth more than 2,000 dollars.

629
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:33,988
I had only about 200 star candies a moment ago.

630
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:35,190
What happened?

631
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,227
Seo Jin.

632
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:41,396
Isn't that you?

633
00:32:41,496 --> 00:32:43,298
What? Why would I...

634
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:45,967
Where is the razor?

635
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:50,638
Here it is.

636
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:53,174
Is she shaving her face?

637
00:32:53,174 --> 00:32:54,275
She has a mustache?

638
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:55,476
This is legendary.

639
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:57,979
- This show is crazy. - This is hilarious.

640
00:32:57,979 --> 00:33:00,648
An eating show turned into a shaving show?

641
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:02,517
What is this?

642
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:05,787
Me shaving was being broadcast?

643
00:33:06,387 --> 00:33:07,488
Thank you, Chewbacca.

644
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:10,158
Thanks to you, I won't end up as a credit delinquent.

645
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,026
That's not important!

646
00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:14,896
People all over the country watched me shave my face.

647
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:16,998
What are you going to do now?

648
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:18,166
What are you going to do?

649
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,435
I didn't mean to do this.

650
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:23,004
Why did you have to shave here?

651
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:25,673
Someone is coming in.

652
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,446
How should I give this to her?

653
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:33,047
My feelings will show. It's not okay.

654
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:35,883
I picked it up on the street.

655
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,019
No. It still shows.

656
00:33:39,387 --> 00:33:41,789
What if she finds out I have feelings for her?

657
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:46,728
What? What is it?

658
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:51,199
Wait!

659
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:58,873
Hold on. What does that mean?

660
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:01,009
"What if she finds out I have feelings for her?"

661
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:03,177
Well...

662
00:34:03,177 --> 00:34:05,647
- No way. - The thing is...

663
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:07,715
You still have feelings for Soo Ah?

664
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:08,783
What?

665
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,618
No. The thing is...

666
00:34:10,618 --> 00:34:13,154
Don't try to deny it. We have evidence.

667
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:15,089
Actually, it's...

668
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:17,825
Dong Gu, can we talk?

669
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:21,729
What?

670
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:24,699
Okay.

671
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:29,304
What's going on?

672
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:34,776
Gosh, he's such a pushover.

673
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,815
Don't you know we're over?

674
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:41,849
What?

675
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:45,420
I do. I know it well, but...

676
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,788
Then why did you do that?

677
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:49,357
Dong Gu, is it so hard to get over me?

678
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:50,858
I can get over you.

679
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:52,794
I can over you this second.

680
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:55,763
I'm over Soo Ah. I've moved on from Soo Ah.

681
00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:57,398
So don't worry. See you.

682
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:02,370
Dong Gu. What should I do with you?

683
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:11,679
It is pretty.

684
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:22,156
He might like me, but he definitely doesn't know my size.

685
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:26,494
Dong Gu, what should I do with you?

686
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:29,397
What should I do with you?

687
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:32,300
Is this why you moved in here?

688
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,735
Did you want to get back together with my brother?

689
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:34,869
It's not like that.

690
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:36,838
I have a conscience.

691
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:39,707
I don't want you two to get back together.

692
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:42,677
Make Dong Gu move on by all means.

693
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:43,678
Understood?

694
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:45,313
Okay.

695
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:49,784
Gosh.

696
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:55,423
Soo Ah.

697
00:35:56,357 --> 00:35:58,359
Why did you want to see me outside?

698
00:35:58,359 --> 00:35:59,494
Well...

699
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,196
I've been thinking about it.

700
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:05,266
I'm afraid I can't accept you again.

701
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:07,268
Is it about that again?

702
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:10,438
I'm okay. Don't worry.

703
00:36:10,438 --> 00:36:12,273
Of course, I'm worried.

704
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,409
Why couldn't you hide your feelings from me?

705
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:17,478
Anyway, I prepared something for you.

706
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,547
You prepared something? What is it?

707
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:20,648
A blind date.

708
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:23,818
What? A blind date?

709
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:27,855
You want to set me up with a girl?

710
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:30,158
She's here. Ye Rin, over here.

711
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,693
Hello. She really came.

712
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,565
This is Ye Rin.

713
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:39,967
This is Dong Gu.

714
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:42,170
Hi. Soo Ah told me a lot about you.

715
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,873
Hi. I wonder what she told you.

716
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:48,009
Dong Gu, good luck.

717
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,677
- What do you mean? - I'll get going now.

718
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:51,679
Where are you going?

719
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:53,648
Soo Ah.

720
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:55,783
Where is she going?

721
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:08,129
("For Love")

722
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:10,598
I'm back.

723
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:12,300
You're back.

724
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,569
Why did you come back so early? What about Ye Rin?

725
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:15,670
What?

726
00:37:16,037 --> 00:37:17,839
We didn't stay that long.

727
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,208
So? How did it go?

728
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:22,143
- Are you going to meet again? - What?

729
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,147
No.

730
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:29,050
Why not? She looked like your ideal type in the picture.

731
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:32,153
Well...

732
00:37:32,453 --> 00:37:34,188
I like how she looks,

733
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:37,325
but I prefer intellectual girls.

734
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:38,659
She is very intellectual.

735
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:41,429
She graduated from Seoul National University and Harvard.

736
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:43,264
She is even a member of Mensa.

737
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:47,034
Really? Appearance and intelligence are important too,

738
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:50,137
but I don't like girls without a sense of humor.

739
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,439
Ye Rin is a comedian.

740
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:53,007
She debuted through JBC's 17th recruitment.

741
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:54,408
She is incredibly funny.

742
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:55,776
Really?

743
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,080
Still,

744
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,450
I didn't get any special feelings.

745
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,684
Cut it out.

746
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:05,386
It's about Soo Ah, isn't it?

747
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:06,954
You're not over her yet, right?

748
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,556
It's not like that.

749
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:11,158
Then why are you not meeting Ye Rin again?

750
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:12,226
Well...

751
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:14,328
Dong Gu, what is wrong with you?

752
00:38:14,328 --> 00:38:16,197
Why do you have to do this to me?

753
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:18,499
It's really not like that.

754
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:29,377
Fine. I'll meet her again.

755
00:38:29,377 --> 00:38:31,646
Then ask her right now while we're watching.

756
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:32,647
What?

757
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:36,717
Fine.

758
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:39,453
I'll ask her. I will.

759
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:40,888
I'll do it right now.

760
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,293
Why can't she help us with cleaning?

761
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,128
Soo Ah, what are you doing...

762
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:52,099
I was going to come downstairs after sorting out my clothes.

763
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:56,003
You just made a mess.

764
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:58,773
Is that from Dong Gu?

765
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:00,808
Yes. It's too small for me.

766
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:02,843
But I couldn't throw it away.

767
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:04,845
Do you want it?

768
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:06,347
Are you sure?

769
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:10,985
Let me see. I'd love to wear it.

770
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:14,488
Wait. It's small for me too.

771
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:17,858
Do you want to try it on?

772
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:19,694
Me? I'm okay.

773
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:21,128
Just try it on.

774
00:39:21,395 --> 00:39:23,864
Come on. Let me see.

775
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,137
It's just your size.

776
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,138
It does.

777
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,640
Do you want to keep it?

778
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,576
I can't. It's for you.

779
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:36,877
I'm fine.

780
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:37,945
Are you sure?

781
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:39,647
Whatever.

782
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:42,416
Why do you have so many clothes when you're broke?

783
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,654
Isn't that a Muharmusi?

784
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,729
It is. Muharmusi.

785
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:57,298
Muharmusi? What's that?

786
00:39:57,798 --> 00:39:59,000
You don't know what it is?

787
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,468
It's a luxury brand.

788
00:40:00,668 --> 00:40:03,104
This is from Muharmusi's...

789
00:40:03,104 --> 00:40:04,839
2017 FW Vintage Collection.

790
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,707
Including Song Hye Kyo, Gianna Jun, and Kim Tae Hee,

791
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:08,309
every celebrity owns an item from that collection.

792
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,077
It was a huge hit.

793
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:12,947
Why do you not want to wear it?

794
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:15,016
I don't know. I haven't been wearing it often.

795
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:16,417
Do you want it?

796
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:19,787
Are you sure? Thank you.

797
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:20,788
Thank you so much.

798
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:23,257
You don't have to clean. Get some rest instead.

799
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:26,494
I'll clean the place. I love you.

800
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,699
This is Muharmusi too. I'm taking them all.

801
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:32,767
Sure.

802
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,068
Muharmusi.

803
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:40,408
Why are you doing this?

804
00:40:40,808 --> 00:40:41,809
What?

805
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:46,347
This scene wasn't in the scenario.

806
00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:49,016
Turn on the light.

807
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:51,419
This is not your first movie.

808
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,554
Why do you have to make a fuss about it?

809
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:56,123
Anyway, if you keep doing this, I can't work with you.

810
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,859
You don't want to shoot? Then pay the penalty fees.

811
00:40:58,859 --> 00:40:59,894
What?

812
00:40:59,894 --> 00:41:01,195
If you don't have enough money,

813
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,797
just do as I say.

814
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:04,799
What do you say? Are you going to do it or not?

815
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:06,967
Let me get some fresh air first.

816
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,437
My goodness.

817
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:25,319
Get up.

818
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,788
- Du Shik. - Get up right now.

819
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,358
What are you doing? Where are we going?

820
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,127
Du Shik, what's going on?

821
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:37,998
You said you didn't want to do this anymore.

822
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,300
Then quit.

823
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,469
Don't force yourself to do things you don't like.

824
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:43,437
Do what you like instead.

825
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:45,339
I can't.

826
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,308
I have a contract with the company.

827
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:50,377
Let me take care of it. You can go home now.

828
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:53,047
I'll call you when I'm done.

829
00:41:57,518 --> 00:41:58,619
Du Shik.

830
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,994
Writer Bong, what did you just say?

831
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:10,898
What? Cherry can't shoot?

832
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:14,168
No. So please don't contact Cherry...

833
00:42:15,503 --> 00:42:17,304
I mean, Mal Geum, again.

834
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:19,974
Wait, who says?

835
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:23,244
Will you compensate for canceling the film casting...

836
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:26,447
and our management's breach of contract?

837
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,616
Yes, I will.

838
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:29,984
How much is it?

839
00:42:35,623 --> 00:42:37,825
It's 40,000 dollars.

840
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,228
What do I do? I must be out of my mind.

841
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:46,567
Ta-da.

842
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:48,869
How do I look, Jun Ki?

843
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:52,606
You look like a beggar in warm clothes.

844
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:55,643
Did you give up looking for a job and start to beg?

845
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:56,844
A beggar?

846
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,512
These are luxury brands.

847
00:42:58,813 --> 00:43:01,649
Muharmusi's 2017 Fall and Winter Vintage Collection.

848
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:03,284
What did you say?

849
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:05,553
Forget it. You don't know anything about fashion.

850
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:07,488
Forget it. I'm going to the library.

851
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:08,789
Stay warm.

852
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:11,158
- Hello, Du Shik. - Hello.

853
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:13,227
Why are you dressed like a beggar in warm clothes?

854
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,462
Why do you have an onion net?

855
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:17,198
It's not an onion net.

856
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:19,099
It's from Muharmusi's 2017...

857
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,634
Muhar... What?

858
00:43:21,468 --> 00:43:22,803
Forget it.

859
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,338
I can't talk to you.

860
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:26,273
You have no idea about fashion.

861
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:28,309
What is she wearing?

862
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,144
Where did she pick up such trash?

863
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:32,913
If she kicks some cans, she'll look like a real beggar.

864
00:43:32,913 --> 00:43:36,050
Right. Jun Ki, that's not what's important.

865
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:37,318
I think I got into trouble.

866
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:40,187
Trouble? What trouble?

867
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:43,924
What? You have to pay for Mal Geum's breach of contract?

868
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:47,228
I felt bad for Mal Geum, so I couldn't help it.

869
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:49,897
Even so, why did you go that far?

870
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:51,699
I didn't think it'd be that much.

871
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:54,168
What should I do? Shall I take out a loan?

872
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:55,603
Not everyone can take out loans.

873
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,938
You can't because you have no job.

874
00:43:58,038 --> 00:44:00,474
What do I do? My goodness.

875
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,746
It's not completely impossible.

876
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:09,483
Do you have a solution?

877
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:13,053
With Superman...

878
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:16,824
The race starts off. It's third in rank.

879
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:20,294
It's followed by number 3 and 4.

880
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:22,162
It hasn't changed much.

881
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:25,633
Isn't this a place where you bet on bicycle races?

882
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:27,001
Isn't it illegal?

883
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:28,168
Of course not.

884
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:30,571
It has a legal permission to operate.

885
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:33,540
It's the only place where you can find a lot of money...

886
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,975
in a short period of time.

887
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:36,176
Really?

888
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:38,312
But we're not guaranteed to win money.

889
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:39,680
There are ways.

890
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:44,351
- Have you heard of Bicycle Ghost? - "Bicycle Ghost"?

891
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:48,188
Bicycle Ghost is someone who can predict the winner of...

892
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,757
the bicycle race.

893
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:54,595
Where is Bicycle Ghost today?

894
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,669
That man is Bicycle Ghost.

895
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:06,473
If you bet on the same racer as him,

896
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:09,343
it's easy to win money.

897
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,646
How would I know on whom he made his bet?

898
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:13,881
There is a way to find out.

899
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:15,816
Follow me.

900
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:19,320
- What are you doing? - Stand right here.

901
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,587
- Do what? - Be quiet.

902
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,258
Get lost.

903
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:26,593
Gosh.

904
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:29,029
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry.

905
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,965
My friend is quite drunk.

906
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,600
How dare you enter after drinking?

907
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,470
Here you go, sir.

908
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:40,207
I'm sorry, sir.

909
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,309
Why did you push me?

910
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,678
I saw whom Bicycle Ghost bet on.

911
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:46,747
- Really? Which one? - Be quiet.

912
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,120
Bet all your money on him.

913
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:55,656
- I'm going to the restroom. - Why?

914
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:57,291
After I got sick from that soup,

915
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,859
I have a bad case of diarrhea.

916
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,627
I'll be back. Bet all your money.

917
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:02,229
Be back soon.

918
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:10,204
Dong Gu, are you going on a date?

919
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:12,039
Yes.

920
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:13,607
Have a good time.

921
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:15,376
Buy her something delicious.

922
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,849
Soo Ah, can I skip the date?

923
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,988
Why?

924
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,024
Is it because of me?

925
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,359
No, that's not why.

926
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,128
I have no money as we have no customers.

927
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:36,030
Dating is quite expensive.

928
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,366
It's not a good idea to date right now.

929
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:41,969
- I think... - Hello, Dong Gu.

930
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:47,241
What brings you here, Ye Rin?

931
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:49,543
Going out is expensive.

932
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,512
I came to share delicious food...

933
00:46:51,512 --> 00:46:52,846
and see you at the same time.

934
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:54,648
I'll make you something delicious.

935
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:56,350
Where's the kitchen?

936
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:57,918
No, it's okay.

937
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:00,054
It's over here. Follow me.

938
00:47:01,722 --> 00:47:02,823
Hello.

939
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:08,295
Did you see how thoughtful she is?

940
00:47:08,295 --> 00:47:11,298
Don't worry about money and be comfortable with her.

941
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:12,466
Okay?

942
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:13,967
Okay.

943
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:16,770
How can she be so thoughtful?

944
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,039
It's incredible.

945
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,209
Gyeongsung passed the fourth corner.

946
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:25,479
On lane five, Dae Yeol Oh. On the outside lane...

947
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:27,047
Why did you come so late? The race started.

948
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:28,182
I'm sorry.

949
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:29,616
I don't feel so good.

950
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:31,151
Did you get the ticket?

951
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:33,387
Yes, here it is. How does it work?

952
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:35,289
It depends on...

953
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:37,658
(Korea Sports Promotion Foundation)

954
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:39,259
Du Shik.

955
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,830
I told you to bet on 1 and 9. Why did you bet on 6 and 1?

956
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:45,666
You wrote 6 and 1 here.

957
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:46,700
What?

958
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:50,137
It's upside down, you punk.

959
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:53,941
You were supposed to turn it around, you fool.

960
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,476
Why didn't you tell me?

961
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:57,344
You ruined it all.

962
00:47:57,511 --> 00:47:59,513
My goodness.

963
00:47:59,513 --> 00:48:00,981
What do we do?

964
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:02,950
Oh, no.

965
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:06,653
- Gosh. - They finish the third round.

966
00:48:06,653 --> 00:48:08,589
He's getting ahead.

967
00:48:08,822 --> 00:48:10,557
They pass the fourth corner.

968
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:14,061
He exceeds the others on the last round.

969
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:16,330
He catches up and gets ahead.

970
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,966
- Number 1 and 6. - Number 6.

971
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:22,769
(Number 6 Jung Ha Jin, Number 1 Park Byung Ho)

972
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:25,272
What happened? What's going on?

973
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,708
You made the right bet.

974
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,243
We won.

975
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:31,178
Did we really win money?

976
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:32,279
That's right.

977
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:35,782
This is amazing.

978
00:48:42,156 --> 00:48:43,290
How much is all this?

979
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:46,059
It's enough to pay what's urgent.

980
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:47,261
Shall we go?

981
00:48:47,828 --> 00:48:48,929
Wait, Du Shik.

982
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:50,697
Don't you think it's unfair if we leave now?

983
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:53,600
You bet only 48 dollars.

984
00:48:53,934 --> 00:48:55,536
It increased within a few minutes.

985
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:58,539
How much would it be if you bet the whole amount?

986
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:00,574
It would be a lot. Why do you ask?

987
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:01,708
Why do I ask?

988
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,444
If we win one more time, you can pay for Mal Geum...

989
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:05,712
and make our wish come true.

990
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:07,981
We can make our own movies.

991
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:10,017
Du Shik.

992
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:12,386
Let's go.

993
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:15,189
"Our own movies"?

994
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:21,361
Ye Rin cooks so well.

995
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:22,529
Don't you think, Dong Gu?

996
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,498
Yes.

997
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:25,732
Do you want some gimbap?

998
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:26,934
I'll feed you.

999
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:30,103
No, it's okay. I'll eat it.

1000
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:31,805
I want to feed you.

1001
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:33,040
Open your mouth.

1002
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,141
It's okay.

1003
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:36,109
I'm sorry.

1004
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:38,278
I just wanted to feed you.

1005
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:42,816
Can I see you for a minute?

1006
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:44,685
Why?

1007
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:46,887
We're in the middle of eating.

1008
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:48,488
What is it?

1009
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:53,594
- Dong Gu, what's wrong with you? - What do you mean?

1010
00:49:53,594 --> 00:49:56,230
Why didn't you let Ye Rin feed you gimbap?

1011
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,731
Why didn't you open your mouth?

1012
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:01,602
- I just wanted to eat it myself. - Stop lying.

1013
00:50:01,802 --> 00:50:03,203
It's because of me.

1014
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:06,106
You couldn't let her feed you because you're worried about me.

1015
00:50:06,106 --> 00:50:08,208
No, it's not like that.

1016
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,043
Then why didn't you open your mouth?

1017
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:13,213
Why didn't you eat it when she gave you delicious gimbap?

1018
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:14,781
Fine, I'll do it.

1019
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:17,050
I'll open my mouth.

1020
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:26,827
How is it? Is it delicious?

1021
00:50:26,893 --> 00:50:28,996
Yes, it's delicious.

1022
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:32,432
Then have one more.

1023
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:34,201
I just took one.

1024
00:50:43,977 --> 00:50:45,145
Goodness.

1025
00:50:55,956 --> 00:50:58,292
Everyone can't take their eyes off of me.

1026
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:00,661
They know what's beautiful.

1027
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:05,732
No wonder it's Muharmusi.

1028
00:51:09,936 --> 00:51:11,038
It's tteokbokki.

1029
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,841
It looks delicious.

1030
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:17,244
May I get one serving of tteokbokki please?

1031
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:19,346
You...

1032
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,415
do have money, right?

1033
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:23,617
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

1034
00:51:23,617 --> 00:51:24,918
You see,

1035
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,120
you have to pay in advance.

1036
00:51:28,155 --> 00:51:29,556
Oh, I see.

1037
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:34,361
I'll take a basket of onions.

1038
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:35,362
Which one would you like?

1039
00:51:35,362 --> 00:51:36,663
- This one here. - This one?

1040
00:51:37,597 --> 00:51:40,434
Oh, dear. I've run out of plastic bags.

1041
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:43,236
There just happens to be an onion net here.

1042
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:44,538
- I'll put them in here for you. - All right.

1043
00:51:44,538 --> 00:51:45,739
This is just perfect.

1044
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,208
(Onions from Muan)

1045
00:51:50,744 --> 00:51:53,146
My bag. Where'd it go?

1046
00:51:54,915 --> 00:51:55,982
My bag.

1047
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:57,684
- Will this be all right? - Ma'am.

1048
00:51:57,684 --> 00:51:59,019
What do you think you're doing?

1049
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:01,121
- What's the problem? - Why...

1050
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:03,190
are you putting onions in my bag?

1051
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,325
This was a bag? I thought it was an onion net.

1052
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:06,827
This isn't an onion net.

1053
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,731
This is from Muharmusi's 2017 Fall and Winter Vintage Collection.

1054
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:13,900
Never mind. Never mind. Move aside.

1055
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:15,702
Wait a minute.

1056
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:19,673
Gosh. It reeks of onion.

1057
00:52:19,673 --> 00:52:20,841
I'm sorry.

1058
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:23,443
- My bag. - I wouldn't pay money for that.

1059
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,351
Hi, Hye Won.

1060
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:33,520
What? You need a replacement for a blind date?

1061
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:37,557
I can't. How could I when I'm still unemployed?

1062
00:52:37,557 --> 00:52:40,193
What? The guy looks like Daniel Kang?

1063
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:42,662
Where are you?

1064
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:50,971
Hye Won. I'm here.

1065
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:52,239
Hi, you're...

1066
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:54,007
here.

1067
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:00,147
I apologize for being late.

1068
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,617
Seo Jin. What's that smell?

1069
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:05,585
It's smells like onions.

1070
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,055
I'm sorry. Something ridiculous just happened to me.

1071
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:13,827
I apologize.

1072
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:16,229
That's all right. Don't worry about it.

1073
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:19,433
My name is Kang Seo Jin.

1074
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:22,769
Did the food suit your taste?

1075
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,572
Yes. It was delicious.

1076
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:27,240
Would you like a gum to freshen your mouth?

1077
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:32,679
- Open your mouth. - I can do it.

1078
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:42,355
What's wrong. Does it hurt?

1079
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:45,192
I have a stiff neck. It must be from stress.

1080
00:53:45,192 --> 00:53:47,694
Really? A foot massage is the best way to relieve stress.

1081
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:48,895
Would you like me to give you a foot massage?

1082
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:50,197
- Pardon? - Put your feet up right here.

1083
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,032
No, no, no. That's all right.

1084
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:54,601
I don't need a foot massage. I'll be all right.

1085
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:56,703
I'm sorry. I just...

1086
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:59,072
wanted to help relieve your stress.

1087
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:02,742
That's all right. There's no need for a foot massage.

1088
00:54:02,742 --> 00:54:05,245
Dong Gu. I'd like to talk with you for a minute.

1089
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:08,482
Why?

1090
00:54:11,518 --> 00:54:13,820
Why are you acting like that again?

1091
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,422
Why did you refuse the foot massage?

1092
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:18,058
Ye Rin offered to give you a foot massage. Why turn her down?

1093
00:54:18,058 --> 00:54:19,125
What?

1094
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,895
We just met yesterday. How could I possibly get a massage?

1095
00:54:21,895 --> 00:54:22,996
You're doing that again.

1096
00:54:23,196 --> 00:54:24,531
Do you think I wouldn't know?

1097
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:26,833
You're refusing to get a massage because of me, aren't you?

1098
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:27,901
It's not that.

1099
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:30,470
It really isn't because of you.

1100
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,906
Then why won't you let her give you a foot massage?

1101
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:36,142
A one-minute refreshing foot massage will take away your stress.

1102
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:37,644
Why on earth won't you get it?

1103
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:38,778
All right. I'll get it.

1104
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:40,881
I'll get it. Are you satisfied?

1105
00:54:55,562 --> 00:54:57,330
Where did Jae Won go?

1106
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,699
Could he have gone to the restroom?

1107
00:55:02,402 --> 00:55:04,137
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1108
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:07,407
Do you know where the guy that was sitting here went?

1109
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:09,276
He just paid the check and left.

1110
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:10,544
He left?

1111
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:14,714
Why would he leave in the middle of a blind date?

1112
00:55:21,888 --> 00:55:23,256
Hye Won. It's me.

1113
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:28,528
A server said Jae Won left while I went to the restroom.

1114
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,063
What's wrong with him?

1115
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,499
Why on earth would you dress like that for a blind date?

1116
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:34,067
What's with that onion net?

1117
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:37,470
It's not an onion bag. It's called a net bag.

1118
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:39,806
You should know that I'm dressed completely in Muharmusi.

1119
00:55:39,806 --> 00:55:41,808
It's the top luxury brand.

1120
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:48,448
So you're saying that he ran away because of how I'm dressed?

1121
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:52,452
What do you mean that's not the reason?

1122
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:56,256
I can't believe this.

1123
00:55:56,623 --> 00:55:59,526
They don't know a thing about fashion. They're so ignorant.

1124
00:55:59,759 --> 00:56:02,462
Even his pores don't resemble Daniel Kang.

1125
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:08,068
Tonight, the star is me It's me, It's me

1126
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:10,503
Muharmusi

1127
00:56:10,503 --> 00:56:12,405
Why didn't you answer my call?

1128
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:20,780
This is unbelievable.

1129
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:23,783
Why can't we get it right even once?

1130
00:56:23,783 --> 00:56:25,318
I don't know. I don't know.

1131
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:28,355
We lost the money we could've walked away with. It's your fault.

1132
00:56:30,056 --> 00:56:31,591
I told you we should just leave.

1133
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:33,259
Look what happened.

1134
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:35,095
Gosh.

1135
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,965
Du Shik. Du Shik. I'm sorry.

1136
00:56:39,265 --> 00:56:40,567
Du Shik.

1137
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:43,403
Forgive me. Du Shik.

1138
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,639
Du Shik. I'm sorry.

1139
00:56:46,606 --> 00:56:48,441
Du Shik. I mean it. I'm sorry.

1140
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:50,210
Forget it. What should we do now?

1141
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,045
We even lost our bus fee. How will we get home?

1142
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:53,213
This is driving me crazy.

1143
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:55,582
We can't possibly walk home.

1144
00:56:56,249 --> 00:56:58,518
I see you've lost everything and can't even afford the bus fee.

1145
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:00,253
Hello, sir.

1146
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,355
Greed will only get you in trouble.

1147
00:57:05,325 --> 00:57:06,359
Here. Take this.

1148
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:10,296
On one condition. Never come here again.

1149
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:11,431
Can you promise me?

1150
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,566
Yes, of course. I'll never come here again.

1151
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:17,337
Thank you. Thank you.

1152
00:57:17,337 --> 00:57:18,838
All right then. I'll be going now.

1153
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:20,807
They'll never be able to stop.

1154
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:23,143
Thank you.

1155
00:57:24,644 --> 00:57:25,745
We're saved.

1156
00:57:25,945 --> 00:57:28,815
We can go home now, thanks to him.

1157
00:57:30,884 --> 00:57:32,786
The bus is here. The bus is here, Jun Ki.

1158
00:57:32,852 --> 00:57:33,853
Hold on, Du Shik.

1159
00:57:34,387 --> 00:57:35,455
What is it this time?

1160
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:37,424
Don't you think we'd regret it it we leave like this?

1161
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:40,460
Let's just bet on one more race.

1162
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,529
What? We don't have any money.

1163
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:45,732
Wait. You're not saying we should bet with this money, are you?

1164
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:47,534
Then what do you intend on telling Mal Geum?

1165
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:50,036
She's relying on you. What are you going to do?

1166
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,106
If we hit the jackpot just once, you can repay her signing bonus...

1167
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:54,974
and possibly make our own film. You might even...

1168
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:58,178
get married to Mal Geum.

1169
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:01,414
Du Shik. Let's do this.

1170
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,083
Let's give it a try.

1171
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:05,351
- Marriage? - Yes.

1172
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:18,398
Gosh.

1173
00:58:18,398 --> 00:58:21,101
It was stupid of me to have trusted you. I was stupid.

1174
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:24,971
I really had a good feeling this time.

1175
00:58:25,105 --> 00:58:26,573
Shut your mouth and just keep walking.

1176
00:58:26,573 --> 00:58:29,075
It's freezing. When on earth will we make it home?

1177
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:31,111
Du Shik.

1178
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,783
Look at this. It's 50 cents. It's 50 cents.

1179
00:58:36,783 --> 00:58:38,752
So what if it's 50 cents? So what?

1180
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:42,222
What? You're not insisting we bet again with that, are you?

1181
00:58:42,222 --> 00:58:44,357
If we hit the jackpot just once, you can repay Mal Geum's money...

1182
00:58:44,357 --> 00:58:47,026
and make our film. Not only can you marry Mal Geum...

1183
00:58:47,026 --> 00:58:48,161
you can even...

1184
00:58:49,095 --> 00:58:50,663
provide a luxurious life for you children.

1185
00:58:51,564 --> 00:58:55,068
Du Shik. Let's do it. Let's do this.

1186
00:58:56,503 --> 00:58:57,504
A luxurious life?

1187
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:08,481
It was stupid of me to have trusted you. I was stupid.

1188
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:10,583
You idiot. You idiot. You idiot.

1189
00:59:11,684 --> 00:59:13,987
I really thought we could win this time.

1190
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,023
Du Shik.

1191
00:59:18,057 --> 00:59:20,093
Look at this. It's a beer bottle. It's a beer bottle.

1192
00:59:20,093 --> 00:59:22,662
So what? What'll we do with a beer bottle? What are trying to say?

1193
00:59:22,662 --> 00:59:25,532
Hey. One of these is worth 13 cents.

1194
00:59:25,532 --> 00:59:27,100
If we find just a few more,

1195
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,935
if we sell them and earn money,

1196
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:30,670
if we bet the money and hit the jackpot,

1197
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,871
it'll cover the bonus, money for your film,

1198
00:59:31,871 --> 00:59:34,040
your marriage and even provide for you children.

1199
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,075
What do you say, Du Shik.

1200
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:38,711
Let's do it. Let's do this.

1201
00:59:38,778 --> 00:59:40,046
You must be crazy.

1202
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:42,448
Why would we gather empty bottles to bet on races, you maniac?

1203
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:44,384
We'll just need a few more bottles.

1204
00:59:44,384 --> 00:59:46,152
Be ambitious, Du Shik.

1205
00:59:46,152 --> 00:59:47,287
Let's do it.

1206
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:49,589
Stop talking nonsense. Let's just go home now.

1207
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:51,691
Follow me, you maniac. I can't believe you.

1208
00:59:51,691 --> 00:59:53,493
- Hey. Hold on. - Come with me.

1209
00:59:53,493 --> 00:59:56,262
This is an event to celebrate the launching of a new product.

1210
00:59:56,262 --> 00:59:57,964
Please come and take part in the event.

1211
00:59:58,164 --> 01:00:00,600
First place will receive a round trip ticket to Jeju Island.

1212
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,268
Please come and join us.

1213
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:04,904
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1214
01:00:05,205 --> 01:00:06,873
Can I give it a try?

1215
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:10,076
Yes. Of course.

1216
01:00:20,053 --> 01:00:21,254
(Fourth Place)

1217
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:24,324
Did you see that?

1218
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:27,760
What's the prize for fourth place?

1219
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:29,696
Here you go.

1220
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,132
My goodness. I can't believe this.

1221
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:35,768
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1222
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:41,708
Thank you.

1223
01:01:05,365 --> 01:01:07,433
This is really good.

1224
01:01:30,857 --> 01:01:32,892
If we had sold those bottles, we could've bet on one more race.

1225
01:01:33,426 --> 01:01:35,161
I saw five bottles on our way here.

1226
01:01:35,628 --> 01:01:37,697
A man should have some ambition.

1227
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:40,667
Shut your mouth, you idiot. Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

1228
01:01:41,734 --> 01:01:43,670
Hey. Hold on. Look.

1229
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,039
That person sure looks familiar.

1230
01:01:46,272 --> 01:01:47,340
What are you talking about?

1231
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:50,510
Wait. Isn't that Seo Jin?

1232
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:51,945
I think it is.

1233
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,847
You're right.

1234
01:01:55,214 --> 01:01:56,349
Seo Jin.

1235
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:58,284
Seo Jin. Wake up.

1236
01:01:58,284 --> 01:01:59,719
Leave me alone.

1237
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,689
You don't know anything about fashion.

1238
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:03,957
She reeks of alcohol.

1239
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,626
Where on earth has she been drinking this early in the day?

1240
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:10,596
My goodness. She even found a can to go with her outfit.

1241
01:02:14,534 --> 01:02:16,302
- Du Shik. - What is it now?

1242
01:02:17,603 --> 01:02:18,671
Look at this.

1243
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:20,206
It's money. It's money.

1244
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:22,775
What? Why does she have cash in her can?

1245
01:02:22,775 --> 01:02:25,078
If we go now, we'll be able to bet one more time before they close.

1246
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:26,846
What do you say?

1247
01:02:27,246 --> 01:02:28,781
Are you insisting we bet again with this money?

1248
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:30,016
Have you really lost your mind, Jun Ki?

1249
01:02:30,016 --> 01:02:32,251
If the Almighty has any conscience, I'm sure he won't let us down.

1250
01:02:32,685 --> 01:02:35,121
Du Shik. Let's do it.

1251
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:37,290
- Let's do this. - Shut your mouth.

1252
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,125
You sound completely insane. Gosh.

1253
01:02:41,394 --> 01:02:43,796
All right. Forget it.

1254
01:02:44,197 --> 01:02:46,199
You won't be able to repay her deposit,

1255
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:47,600
you won't be able to get married,

1256
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,937
and you'll end up living the rest of your life doing one-sided love.

1257
01:02:51,237 --> 01:02:52,305
Forget it.

1258
01:02:53,072 --> 01:02:54,240
I can't let that happen.

1259
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:57,877
Then Du Shik, let's give it one last try.

1260
01:02:58,311 --> 01:03:00,480
Du Shik. Let's do it.

1261
01:03:00,813 --> 01:03:02,081
Let's do this.

1262
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:05,585
You're right. I can't live the rest of my life doing one-sided love.

1263
01:03:06,185 --> 01:03:08,287
Let's do it. Let's do this.

1264
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,893
Let's go. Hurry.

1265
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:22,902
I'll be going now.

1266
01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:24,704
Get home safely, Ye Rin.

1267
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:27,440
Dong Gu. I really like you.

1268
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:29,409
How about we officially start dating?

1269
01:03:30,943 --> 01:03:32,045
What?

1270
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,916
Listen. Ye Rin.

1271
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:39,385
Please don't take this personally.

1272
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:43,356
Ye Rin. You're pretty, sophisticated,

1273
01:03:43,356 --> 01:03:46,459
have a great sense of humor, and considerate. You're a great cook,

1274
01:03:46,459 --> 01:03:48,594
give amazing foot massages, and even...

1275
01:03:49,228 --> 01:03:51,697
do a great job at cleaning ears. You're basically perfect.

1276
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,336
I don't think I'm good enough for you, Ye Rin.

1277
01:03:57,503 --> 01:03:58,771
- Also... - Hold on.

1278
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:01,107
I'm being rejected, aren't I?

1279
01:04:01,474 --> 01:04:02,708
That's not what it is.

1280
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,545
Why? Do you have feelings for someone by any chance?

1281
01:04:06,312 --> 01:04:07,380
Pardon?

1282
01:04:08,181 --> 01:04:09,315
You see...

1283
01:04:09,315 --> 01:04:10,483
I was right then.

1284
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:14,353
What do you mean?

1285
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:17,790
Are you talking about Soo Ah and I?

1286
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:20,460
Soo Ah and I are just friends.

1287
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,062
- We're clearly just friends. - I'm not talking about Soo Ah.

1288
01:04:23,062 --> 01:04:24,931
- I'm talking about Yoon Ah. - Excuse me?

1289
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:27,100
Seeing how flustered you are, I guess I'm right.

1290
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,168
How did you know?

1291
01:04:29,168 --> 01:04:32,305
I'm quick-witted, so don't you try to lie to me.

1292
01:04:33,172 --> 01:04:34,707
I'm sorry, Ye Rin.

1293
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:37,410
But could you possibly keep this a secret?

1294
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,545
All right. I'll be going now.

1295
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,947
Thank you, Ye Rin.

1296
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:43,282
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1297
01:04:45,985 --> 01:04:47,086
Goodbye.

1298
01:04:50,656 --> 01:04:53,559
Although she seemed liked the perfect girl,

1299
01:04:54,193 --> 01:04:55,695
it turns out she had a flaw.

1300
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:57,964
What?

1301
01:04:59,098 --> 01:05:01,067
Dong Gu has feelings for Yoon Ah?

1302
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,235
That's what I said.

1303
01:05:02,535 --> 01:05:05,204
I asked him out but I got rejected.

1304
01:05:05,538 --> 01:05:07,707
At that moment, I sensed it.

1305
01:05:07,874 --> 01:05:09,509
So I asked him and he confessed.

1306
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:11,844
Dong Gu confessed to you?

1307
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:15,781
All right. I'll talk to you later. All right.

1308
01:05:18,684 --> 01:05:21,287
Then Dong Gu really has feelings for Yoon Ah?

1309
01:05:22,922 --> 01:05:24,056
Wait a minute.

1310
01:05:24,724 --> 01:05:26,859
If I give her this, what if she sensed that I like her?

1311
01:05:26,859 --> 01:05:29,162
I was going to ask you to give this to Soo Ah, but I don't need to now.

1312
01:05:29,162 --> 01:05:30,363
Here you go, Soo Ah.

1313
01:05:32,398 --> 01:05:34,000
It fits perfectly on you.

1314
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:36,769
Didn't Yoon Ah say she was going to the supermarket?

1315
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:40,072
Where are you going?

1316
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:45,878
Shall I get some cleaning done?

1317
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,315
Dong Gu. You, you,

1318
01:05:49,982 --> 01:05:51,083
you...

1319
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,152
What is it? What's wrong?

1320
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:56,556
Is that why you ran out after hearing about the fire?

1321
01:05:56,722 --> 01:05:57,924
And the coat...

1322
01:05:58,658 --> 01:06:00,726
So the person you like...

1323
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:03,429
is actually Yoon Ah and not me?

1324
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:05,965
What?

1325
01:06:06,632 --> 01:06:09,235
What are you talking about?

1326
01:06:09,635 --> 01:06:11,771
Don't try to deny it. Ye Rin told me everything.

1327
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:14,273
What? She said she'd keep it a secret.

1328
01:06:14,273 --> 01:06:15,841
She told you already?

1329
01:06:20,813 --> 01:06:23,049
Dong Gu. Did Ye Rin arrive home safely?

1330
01:06:23,716 --> 01:06:24,784
Pardon?

1331
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:27,386
Be quiet.

1332
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:30,223
What?

1333
01:06:30,356 --> 01:06:32,592
My goodness. I can't believe this.

1334
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:34,894
This sure is big news.

1335
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:39,265
Soo Ah. What's the matter? Is something wrong?

1336
01:06:39,732 --> 01:06:42,835
So you see, it wasn't me that Dong Gu likes. It's actually...

1337
01:06:42,835 --> 01:06:45,972
Oh, dear. Soo Ah.

1338
01:06:49,909 --> 01:06:52,778
(Thank you to special guest, Han Bo Bae.)

1339
01:07:02,521 --> 01:07:05,958
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1340
01:07:06,025 --> 01:07:07,260
Yoon Ah. Have this.

1341
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,362
Soo Ah and I are just friends.

1342
01:07:09,495 --> 01:07:12,198
That's right. Dong Gu seems to have feelings for someone else.

1343
01:07:12,331 --> 01:07:14,000
There, there, Sol. Don't cry.

1344
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,201
What's wrong?

1345
01:07:15,301 --> 01:07:17,069
If you don't mind, I'll try comforting her.

1346
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:18,137
That's amazing.

1347
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:19,272
Thank you. You saved me.

1348
01:07:19,272 --> 01:07:21,340
We have a new instructor today.

1349
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,342
Let me introduce him to you all.

1350
01:07:23,342 --> 01:07:24,777
Don't you know the pastry chef, Song Hyun Joon?

1351
01:07:24,777 --> 01:07:26,045
He's a famous pastry chef.

1352
01:07:26,045 --> 01:07:28,214
She's that first love you were talking about, right?

1353
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:30,149
These pictures bring back old memories.

1354
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:32,118
You and I were inseparable.

1355
01:07:32,118 --> 01:07:34,487
By the way, since when did you like me?

1356
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:35,655
Where did that come from all of a sudden?

1357
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:37,290
- I'm not your first love, am I? - What?

1358
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:40,426
It's amazing how you can take naps when you should be job-searching.

1359
01:07:40,426 --> 01:07:41,494
You sure seem relaxed.

1360
01:07:41,494 --> 01:07:43,029
You jerk. Do you want to die?

1361
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:44,764
Gosh. Stop it, you two.

1362
01:07:44,764 --> 01:07:46,365
People usually grow fond that way.

1363
01:07:46,365 --> 01:07:47,800
What? Grow fond of him?

1364
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,036
Even if I were stranded on an island with him,

1365
01:07:50,036 --> 01:07:51,837
I would never end up having a relationship with that jerk.
