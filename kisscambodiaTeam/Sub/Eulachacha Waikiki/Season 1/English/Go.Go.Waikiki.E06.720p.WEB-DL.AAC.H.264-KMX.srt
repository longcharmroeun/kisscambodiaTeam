<i>[This program is suitable

3
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:16,998
The Japanese put six bullets in my body.

4
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:20,548
This is from an assassination attempt
in 1929 in Gyeongseong.

5
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:22,288
There are two holes.

6
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:25,038
This was in 1922 in Shanghai.

7
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:27,678
This one was in 1927 Khabarovsk.

8
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,885
Then in 1932,
this was during the the explosion.

9
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,478
By my heart right here,
that was in 1933.

10
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:35,784
They say I turned on three comrades.

11
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:38,319
None of you know the truth!

12
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:41,936
You do not know what I was feeling
when I let them go.

13
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:46,247
They were walking toward their deaths.

14
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,469
Judge!

15
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,472
Thanks for the audition.
Leave your profile there.

16
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, sir. I am rookie actor,
Lee Joon Ki.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,567
Please give me a chance.

18
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:59,963
Director, we don't have much time left.

19
00:00:59,963 --> 00:01:01,634
Where will we find an actor so quickly?

20
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,292
You're right.

21
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,590
Hold on.

22
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:07,246
Hey, you.

23
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,061
- Come here.
- Me?

24
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:11,099
Okay.

25
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,376
Why are you doing that?

26
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:19,596
What's your height and weight?

27
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,646
I'm 180 centimeters and 71 kilograms.

28
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:24,296
180 centimeters and 71 kilograms?

29
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:27,385
Do you want to be in our film?
We have a role.

30
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:28,807
Really?

31
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:31,942
Whichever role you give me,
I'll work very hard!

32
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:33,656
Okay.

33
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:37,802
The thing is,
it's for a bed scene...

34
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:38,926
You'd be a stand-in.

35
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,444
It's not even just a bed scene.

36
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:44,131
But, a stand-in for the bed scene?

37
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:46,272
I don't know about that.

38
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,524
- It's a bit difficult, right?
- Yes, it is.

39
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:51,796
You happen to have
a similar physique to our main actor.

40
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:53,135
I was just asking.

41
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,403
Okay. You should get going.

42
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:55,954
Thank you.

43
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,888
Gosh.

44
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,387
We have everything set up.

45
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,371
Soo Jung thinks we're shooting that day.

46
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:09,997
Wait, did you say Soo Jung?

47
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:13,199
The epitome of innocence and glamor,
actress Shin Soo Jung?

48
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,814
- Yes.
- Then, she'd be who I film with?

49
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:17,605
- Shin Soo Jung?
- Yes.

50
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,697
The main female actor for our film
is Shin Soo Jung.

51
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:21,147
I will do the bed scene.

52
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:22,794
I will do it no matter what!

53
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:23,878
Okay, sounds good!

54
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,324
None of you know the truth!

55
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:28,210
Wow.

56
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,555
<i>[Jealousy Is My Strength]</i>

57
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:38,627
Make sure to get it everywhere.
Don't miss a spot.

58
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:39,665
All right.

59
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:42,388
Also, focus on my back.

60
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:44,258
- The back is important.
- I heard you.

61
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:46,498
You have to keep your promise though.

62
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:48,669
- Shin Soo Jung's autograph.
- Okay.

63
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,649
Make sure to spread it out everywhere
to every crevice.

64
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:52,929
Hold still, would you?

65
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:54,247
I'm home.

66
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:55,576
My back.

67
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:59,086
What is this offensive image here?

68
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:02,165
Joon Ki got cast in a film,
so he's taking care of his skin.

69
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:04,705
What is the role that he has to
take care of his back?

70
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:07,914
He's a stand-in for a bed scene.

71
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:10,344
What? A stand-in for a bed scene?

72
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:13,596
Gosh, you're doing all kinds of crap now.

73
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:16,377
Let go! Hey! What do you mean?

74
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:18,807
Do you know who I'm filming
the bed scene with?

75
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,546
It's Shin Soo Jung, Shin Soo Jung!

76
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:24,877
Even if I weren't a stand-in, but crew,
I'd have to say thank you.

77
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:26,225
That's how it is.

78
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:27,269
Of course.

79
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,942
It's not just anyone.
It's Shin Soo Jung.

80
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,864
Goodness.

81
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:33,587
What's with men?

82
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,919
Oh, I'm going to get going then.

83
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,058
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

84
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:41,811
Oh, it's your first day at
the baking academy, right?

85
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:44,209
- Yes.
- Have a nice day.

86
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,638
Don't get sleepy in class,
and listen to your instructor.

87
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,599
- Okay.
- Did you forget anything?

88
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,669
Of course, not.
I have my wallet and phone.

89
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:53,995
Do you know how to get there?

90
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:57,425
Of course, the way there is...

91
00:03:57,425 --> 00:04:00,151
- Well...
- Here.

92
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:02,111
This is the bus number and your stop.

93
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,729
I wrote the directions to the school,
so follow this.

94
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,151
Thank you, Dong Gu.

95
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:09,699
I'll be going, then.

96
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,730
- Have a good day.
- I will.

97
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,480
- Be careful of cars.
- Okay!

98
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:17,684
Hey, what was that?

99
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:18,978
What is this sweet mood

100
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:21,278
like that of a newlywed couple
saying bye in the morning?

101
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:24,507
Yeah, you even drew her
a map with directions.

102
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:28,016
Something smells very suspicious.

103
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,728
What? What's so suspicious?

104
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,978
I did it in case she created
a hassle by getting lost.

105
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:36,377
Stop sniffing me.

106
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,468
Why are you getting mad over a joke?

107
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:40,567
That angry boy.
What's with him?

108
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,242
Yeah, it's more suspicious of him
to act that way.

109
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,076
What's so suspicious?

110
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,677
Are they suggesting I like Yoon Ah?

111
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:51,249
It's just sympathy. That's all.

112
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,298
It's just helping a disadvantaged person.

113
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,161
Yes, of course.

114
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:58,519
The problem is that I'm too kind.

115
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,334
Oh, you're so nice.

116
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,452
First, make sure to get this down.

117
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,151
Kneading the dough with hot water...

118
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:13,870
Thank you.

119
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:22,110
I'll have skin like a baby if I use this.

120
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,206
Great.

121
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:27,331
Dong Gu, can you put lots of this
on my butt when we get home?

122
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:28,654
You're insane. No way.

123
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:30,298
Why are you asking me? Are you crazy?

124
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:33,012
You're really going all out, seriously.

125
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,932
No need to get testy.

126
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:36,697
Isn't that Yoon Ah?

127
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:40,223
Thanks for the ride home.
Get home safely.

128
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,343
Bye.

129
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,526
- Yoon Ah.
- Why are you out here?

130
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:46,827
Were you waiting for me?

131
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:48,129
Why would we wait?

132
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,603
We were buying diapers for Sol.

133
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:51,610
Who's that?

134
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,033
Oh, I met him in class.

135
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,798
He drove me on his way home.

136
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:59,014
Wow, you're already so popular, Yoon Ah.

137
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:00,363
Popular, yeah right.

138
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:03,293
Why would you get in a car with
someone you don't know well?

139
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:05,374
She said they met in class.

140
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:09,694
Also, what's it to you
whose car she gets into or not?

141
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:13,473
That's because she's being a nuisance.

142
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,670
I told you not to be a burden to
others and be indebted to them.

143
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,331
That it becomes a habit?
Yeah, I'll be careful.

144
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:21,160
If you know, then good!

145
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:25,798
Why is he getting mad? Huh?

146
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:34,134
What is it? You don't like it?

147
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:38,165
I think it would be better if there
were a more provocative scene.

148
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,672
I'm not too sure what you mean.

149
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,607
Here.

150
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,086
Take a look at this.

151
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:45,999
"Free Wife 2017."

152
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,963
"I want to play aggressively tonight."

153
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:49,144
That's right.

154
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:52,812
Then I'll take a look for now.

155
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:58,350
Don't work out too much before the shoot.

156
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,103
You have to maintain your body, okay?

157
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,526
Yes, Director.

158
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:03,156
The main male lead will be here soon.

159
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,182
Let's try to match the hair,
skin tone, and other details.

160
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:08,980
Don't worry too much.
You two are nearly the same.

161
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:12,845
Oh, you're here.

162
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,875
- Yes, Director.
- Say hello.

163
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:18,706
This is your stand-in for
the bed scene, Lee Joon Ki.

164
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,911
Hello, my name is Lee Joon Ki.

165
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,701
I'm Kim Woo Sung.
Let's work well together.

166
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,122
I'm a fan.

167
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:30,052
Oh, what happened?

168
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:32,411
Why did you lose so much weight
in just a few weeks?

169
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,942
I was sick and suddenly lost weight.

170
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:37,011
- I couldn't gain even though I ate.
- Oh no.

171
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:38,889
Really? How much did you lose?

172
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,740
I weighed 71 kilograms.

173
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,262
I weighed myself this morning
and I weighed 60 kilograms.

174
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,555
What? How much do you weigh again?

175
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:46,855
71 kilograms.

176
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:50,543
I think we may need a new stand-in.

177
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:54,954
What? This can't happen.

178
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,834
Director, I will lose the weight.

179
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,740
You're going to lose 10 kilograms?

180
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,261
I will do whatever it takes
and lose the weight.

181
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:06,593
<i>You agreed to lose
10 kilograms in one week?</i>

182
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:10,413
Why do you have to lose weight
like that just for a bed scene?

183
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:11,752
Do you really not know?

184
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:14,629
Shin Soo Jung.

185
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,307
I don't think I need to explain further.

186
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:20,658
You would walk on fire just to film
a bed scene with Shin Soo Jung.

187
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:24,971
Not only would I walk on fire,
I'd even jump off a cliff for it.

188
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,677
<i>Yoon Ah, are you home?</i>

189
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:29,257
I'm not expecting anyone.

190
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:33,703
- Wow.
- It smells good.

191
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:36,231
What is all of this, Sang Yeon?

192
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:39,490
I happened to bake some doughnuts.

193
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,519
I baked too many.

194
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,475
I wanted you to try some.

195
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:47,115
Oh, I see. Thank you so much.

196
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,168
Yoon Ah, who is he?

197
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:52,614
You're the person
who drove Yoon Ah, right?

198
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:53,946
You attend the same academy?

199
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,054
That's right.

200
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,335
Hello, I'm Lee Sang Yeon.

201
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,892
- Yes, I saw you.
- Hello.

202
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,575
You must be Sol.

203
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:05,092
So cute. Peekaboo.

204
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:10,375
You drove Yoon Ah home
and you've brought doughnuts.

205
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,639
Are you interested in Yoon Ah?
Green light?

206
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:17,418
Yes, I...

207
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:20,620
am interested in Yoon Ah.

208
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:30,546
Me feelings are just one-sided,
so please don't feel burdened by them.

209
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,150
Ah, okay.

210
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:35,397
Sorry, but could I use the bathroom?

211
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:38,378
Yes, it's just over there.

212
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,467
Yes. One moment, please.

213
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:44,488
He proposed with doughnuts.

214
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:47,660
What's this?
That guy is interested in you.

215
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,669
What are you talking about?
It's not like that.

216
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,621
He just said so himself.

217
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,559
You should give it a go.
He seems like a good guy.

218
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,332
Hey, what do you know about him
to say he's a good guy?

219
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:58,336
He has a weird look in his eyes,
in my opinion.

220
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:00,280
Yoon Ah, be careful of him.

221
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,572
- What?
- Hey, man.

222
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,480
Who are you to tell her
to be careful or not?

223
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,513
I'm just saying it out of concern.
I'm worried.

224
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:08,153
If she dates a weird guy

225
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,600
Yoon Ah may have
difficulties in her life.

226
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,722
Shut up! You're not making sense.

227
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:14,298
This looks good. Eat a doughnut.

228
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:16,214
Forget it. I don't want it.

229
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,168
- I said I didn't want it!
- How dare you get mad at me?

230
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:23,888
What a waste of the doughnut.
Why didn't you just take the doughnut?

231
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:35,660
<i>[Han Yoon Ah]</i>

232
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,309
What are you doing here?

233
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:50,639
Why are you brushing your teeth
with that toothbrush?

234
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,514
Ah... my mouth felt a little dirty.

235
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:57,053
Then why don't you ask for a toothbrush?

236
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,164
Why are you using Yoon Ah's toothbrush?

237
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:00,164
Pardon?

238
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:03,932
Oh, was this Yoon Ah's?

239
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:05,373
I really didn't know.

240
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,986
How could you not know?
Her name is written right there.

241
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:14,193
Ah... the names are written there.

242
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:16,047
Oh, geez.

243
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:22,866
I really didn't know. Bye, now.

244
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,442
It's written right there.
What's with that guy?

245
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:36,171
I had a great time today.
I'll get going.

246
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:37,754
Yoon Ah, see you in class.

247
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,363
Yes, get home safely.

248
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,354
- Goodbye.
- Come again.

249
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:42,904
Bye.

250
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:43,908
He's a cool guy.

251
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:46,429
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah.
Come over here.

252
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,655
Sit down, sit down.

253
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,927
Yoon Ah, he is a really great guy.

254
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,437
Yeah, he has good manners
and he looks like a nice person.

255
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:55,996
Nice person? Yeah, right.

256
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,708
Something's off about him.

257
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,168
What is?

258
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:02,768
I went up to the bathroom earlier.

259
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:05,078
He was brushing his teeth
with Yoon Ah's toothbrush.

260
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:07,004
What? My toothbrush?

261
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:08,390
His mouth must've felt dirty.

262
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,323
Hey, does it make sense to use
another person's toothbrush?

263
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:14,171
Why not? I sometimes use yours.

264
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:15,754
What? Why?

265
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:19,215
Your toothbrush is soft.
Mine is so hard.

266
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:22,583
- It hurts and I bleed.
- That's so dirty!

267
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:26,110
Anyway, I got a bad feeling.
He's very weird.

268
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,153
You're the weird one.

269
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:31,870
What? Are you jealous
because he's friendly with Yoon Ah?

270
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,460
Yeah, you gave her directions
this morning.

271
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,015
Do you like Yoon Ah, by chance?

272
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,850
What? Me?

273
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,581
Like Yoon Ah?

274
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,662
Just forget it. I shouldn't bring it up.

275
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:52,971
Gosh, is worrying about a person
considered liking her?

276
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,743
I just have a kind heart.

277
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:55,846
Why are you all doing that?

278
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:57,852
He's been acting strange since morning...

279
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:59,076
What is it? What is it?

280
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:01,602
I talked so much today
that I'm dying of hunger.

281
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:04,072
You think starving will help you
lose 10 kilograms in a week?

282
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:07,212
I don't know what else to do
in order to lose weight.

283
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:08,725
Ask Seo Jin for help.

284
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:10,442
She diets 365 days a year.

285
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,308
Really?

286
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,970
Seo Jin, help me with my diet.

287
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,615
- For free?
- Geez.

288
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,740
You capitalistic girl.

289
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,339
Fine, I'll buy you
the newest model razor that's out.

290
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,461
It even pulls the roots out.

291
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:29,768
Okay, but you have to do
everything I tell you to.

292
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,693
Right, I'm supposed to watch this.

293
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:39,426
There's going to be a ruckus
if I get caught watching this.

294
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,793
Why are you so startled?

295
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,028
I'm not.

296
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:55,690
Why don't you knock before coming in?

297
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,807
Why would I knock
before coming into my own room?

298
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:01,304
What? Were you secretly watching porn?

299
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:04,316
No, what porn? What are you saying?

300
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:07,235
I suppose you don't watch that stuff.

301
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:09,511
You're such an innocent guy.

302
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:11,489
- Hey.
- Huh?

303
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:13,207
What? What is it?

304
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,618
Isn't that Sang Yeon guy kind of weird?

305
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:20,788
He has eyes that are kind of perverted.

306
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:24,445
I don't know. I didn't notice.

307
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,592
Really? That's strange.

308
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:29,546
Hey, is this lock broken?

309
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:32,075
Yeah, it's been broken
for a long time. Why?

310
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:33,533
No reason.

311
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,236
You were in here?

312
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:45,543
Gosh, I told you to knock.

313
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:48,232
Sorry, I didn't know anyone was in here.

314
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,711
What are you doing in here
with your laptop?

315
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,912
Huh? Oh, I'm writing my script.

316
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:56,312
- I write well in the bathroom.
- Really?

317
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,866
Then go on and write.
I'm just going to wash my hands.

318
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,163
Okay.

319
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,783
- Hey.
- Huh?

320
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,513
What? What is it?

321
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:08,371
Now that I think about it,
that guy didn't even use toothpaste.

322
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:10,784
Does it make sense to brush your
teeth without toothpaste?

323
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,188
I suppose you could.

324
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:13,458
Really?

325
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:15,592
You can?

326
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:17,804
Hey, is this lock broken too?

327
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:20,153
Yes, this one's been
broken for a long time too.

328
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,211
And the second floor guest rooms?

329
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,596
Those are broken too.
None of the locks work in our house.

330
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:26,471
Then fix them. Just fix them!
Why don't you fix them if you know?

331
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:28,235
Why? Gosh!

332
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,995
Am I the only owner?

333
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,537
That punk.

334
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:38,356
No toothpaste?
Did I misunderstand it?

335
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:41,534
<i>If I do this, will I lose weight?</i>

336
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:44,381
<i>Here. Wear all of this.</i>

337
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:45,852
I have to film the bed scene.

338
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:48,279
Where do you think you're going?

339
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,600
<i>Start your jumping jacks, now.</i>

340
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:54,399
Shin Soo Jung! Bed scene!

341
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,883
<i>You would walk on fire just to film
a bed scene with Shin Soo Jung.</i>

342
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:01,613
<i>Not only would I walk on fire,
I'd even jump off a cliff for it.</i>

343
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:02,801
Get up now!

344
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:11,225
<i>Shin Soo Jung. Bed scene.</i>

345
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:13,554
Bed scene!

346
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,443
Shin Soo Jung!

347
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,932
I don't see Doo Shik around.

348
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,667
He went out to meet the director.

349
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:27,500
He seems busy with that script.

350
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,530
Joon Ki, are you all right?

351
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,619
Joon Ki.

352
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,197
A white tunnel... huh?

353
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,390
You startled me.

354
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,634
What is it? Are you okay?

355
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,956
I'm okay. I think I fainted for a moment.

356
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:47,923
Even if you have to lose weight,
you should eat something.

357
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,562
You could really die, Joon Ki.

358
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,513
It's okay, it's okay.

359
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,873
I can drink water... water.

360
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:58,471
No, water is banned starting today.

361
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,923
You're shooting the scene
the day after tomorrow.

362
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,101
You're going too far.

363
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:07,413
If you don't want to do the bed scene
with Shin Soo Jung...

364
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:09,230
then you can drink it.

365
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:21,054
I'm going to do it. I am.

366
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,050
Bed scene.

367
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,300
<i>Yoon Ah, I'm here.</i>

368
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,407
That sounds like Sang Yeon.

369
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,493
Why is that guy here again?

370
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:37,905
Sang Yeon, what brings you by again?

371
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,305
There's a great pizza place
in my neighborhood.

372
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:43,079
I bought some for us to eat together.

373
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,459
How unfortunate.
We just ate rice.

374
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:50,057
What do you mean?
There's always room for pizza.

375
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,641
Thank you.

376
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,818
You're such a pig.

377
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:08,871
Don't even dream about it.

378
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,108
You cruel girl.

379
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:14,671
You don't even have blood in your veins.

380
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:17,666
This pizza is really delicious.

381
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,413
Is it?

382
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:21,594
Sang Yeon, you should eat it too.

383
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:23,188
No, thank you. I had some already.

384
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:24,797
Yoon Ah, you should eat lots.

385
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:26,340
Yes, thank you.

386
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,953
Excuse me.

387
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:39,946
- What?
- What were you just doing?

388
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:43,057
- What did I do?
- What's wrong, Dong Gu?

389
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:46,247
That guy was sniffing Yoon Ah's hair.

390
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:50,397
Me? I wasn't doing that.

391
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,347
I was smelling the pizza.

392
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:54,856
I saw it very clearly.
Are you going to keep lying?

393
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:57,501
Oh, I'm sure you saw wrong.

394
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:00,034
Why would Sang Yeon smell my hair?

395
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:01,642
That's what I'm wondering!

396
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,571
What's wrong with smelling hair?

397
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:07,124
I often smell your hair.

398
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:09,666
My hair? Why, why, why?

399
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:14,362
There's a yummy smell
coming from your hair.

400
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,744
- Black bean noodles are tasty.
- What are you doing?

401
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:19,041
Stop that, stop that!

402
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,022
I really saw him smelling Yoon Ah's hair.

403
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:24,416
- Why are you being so rude?
- I really saw it.

404
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,162
I really saw it. I did!
I'm going crazy here.

405
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:28,711
Seriously, now.

406
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:31,718
Sang Yeon, I'm sorry.
I'll apologize on his behalf.

407
00:19:31,718 --> 00:19:34,803
No, it's my fault for
causing the misunderstanding.

408
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:35,898
Wow.

409
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,628
I'll take a look around
the guest house while you all eat.

410
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,181
Sure.

411
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,614
Yoon Ah...

412
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,226
You have something on your lip.

413
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,865
Oh, thank you.

414
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:50,402
It was just a birthmark.

415
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,061
Should I head this way?

416
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,569
Yes, you can look around.

417
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,673
Why are you taking that?

418
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:00,571
Why is he taking that?

419
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,678
Dong Gu, what's with you?

420
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,893
He took that tissue with him!

421
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,463
Dong Gu, calm down.

422
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:07,851
Wow! I'm truly going insane.

423
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:11,714
He put the tissue in here...
Joon Ki, you have no right to eat!

424
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:14,226
What about the bed scene? Bed scene!

425
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:15,390
Shut up!

426
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,544
Yoon Ah's scent.

427
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,769
I think that Sang Yeon
really likes you, Yoon Ah.

428
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:45,929
How do you feel about him?

429
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:47,481
I told you it's not like that.

430
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:49,138
Don't be like that and date him.

431
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:52,300
He's good looking, gentle,
and I heard he has a nice car.

432
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,685
That means he's successful too--

433
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,441
Stop that. What's with you?

434
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,122
Oh, I thought you should eat more pizza.

435
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:01,151
You like pizza.

436
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:05,589
What is he doing
that he's not coming back?

437
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:08,815
Jesus. Wow.

438
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:14,932
Yoon Ah.

439
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:18,557
Ah... be brave.

440
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:22,478
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah.

441
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:35,948
- What are you doing here?
- What?

442
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:37,920
Well, actually...

443
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,339
Why are you wearing Yoon Ah's clothes?

444
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,190
What's going on here?

445
00:21:44,618 --> 00:21:46,509
Oh my. Sang Yeon!

446
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,317
Why are you in my clothes...

447
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:51,406
Wait... this is all
a misunderstanding, Yoon Ah.

448
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:54,176
Misunderstanding?
You were caught red-handed.

449
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:56,486
Sang Yeon, what's going on here?

450
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:58,444
Well, I...

451
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:01,317
Well, to tell you the truth...

452
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:06,107
I wanted to know what your size was.

453
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,655
I wanted to buy you a coat as a gift.

454
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:11,178
Your coat looked so worn down.

455
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:14,804
Wait. What did you say?

456
00:22:14,804 --> 00:22:18,115
You could ask her yourself
if you need to know her size.

457
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:21,799
Also, the sizes are on the clothing tag.
Why would you try it on?

458
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,521
If I asked her myself,
then Yoon Ah would know.

459
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:28,170
Her pride might be hurt,
so I couldn't ask her.

460
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,280
And the coat is so old that
the size was erased from the tag.

461
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,431
That's why I tried it on.
Are you satisfied?

462
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:39,180
Oh, that's what it was.
We didn't even know.

463
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,210
Hey, you believe him?

464
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,820
Even so, why would a guy
try on a woman's clothes?

465
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,546
Why not?

466
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:47,465
I put on Seo Jin's clothes sometimes.

467
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:48,887
Why would you? Why?

468
00:22:48,887 --> 00:22:52,528
I wear them down to get back at her.

469
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:54,070
That's why I wear them.

470
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,813
What? Are you crazy?

471
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,567
I am sorry though.

472
00:23:00,954 --> 00:23:03,832
I think I made you
uncomfortable again, Dong Gu.

473
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:07,032
I only had good intentions.

474
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,163
I will get going now.

475
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:17,394
Oh! He smelled it!

476
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:20,266
- Sang Yeon, Sang Yeon!
- Did you see?

477
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,986
Dong Gu, what is the matter with you?

478
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,276
I'm telling you I saw it!

479
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,965
Thank you for the ride.

480
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:38,532
Writer Bong, did you finish
watching that movie I gave you?

481
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:40,913
Oh, you mean "Free Wife"?

482
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,492
Yes, a bit.

483
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:44,343
She was a very free wife.

484
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:46,384
Not a bad movie, right? Here.

485
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:48,931
Try this one.

486
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:52,787
This one is a masterpiece
of erotic films.

487
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:54,423
Ah, okay.

488
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:57,688
- Drive home safely.
- All right.

489
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:03,344
Why does he keep giving me these?
I have nowhere to watch.

490
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:05,023
What is it this time?

491
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:08,063
"Sweet Whip:
I can't forget the taste."

492
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:09,973
It's even more erotic this time.

493
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:11,869
I'm scared someone will see.

494
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,178
Sang Yeon,
you can't just leave like this.

495
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:16,583
I'll apologize on his behalf.

496
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:20,371
No, Yoon Ah. I don't think I should stay
while being suspected of these things.

497
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,230
What are you doing, Dong Gu?
Apologize to him.

498
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,241
Why should I?
What did I do wrong?

499
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:25,816
He's leaving because of you.

500
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:27,215
Are you going to be this way?

501
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,903
Wait, wait!

502
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:42,434
What is this?
Aren't these women's panties?

503
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:44,796
No, these...

504
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:46,857
are my panties.

505
00:24:46,857 --> 00:24:49,646
What? You claim these are yours?

506
00:24:49,646 --> 00:24:53,690
These hot, red panties with lace?

507
00:24:55,132 --> 00:24:59,037
Yes, I like this kind of design.

508
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,930
It gives my heart peace.

509
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,148
You are shameless, so shameless.

510
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:08,109
Even if they are yours, why would
anyone carry around women's panties?

511
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,959
Why not?

512
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:12,440
When I'm in a bad mood--

513
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,762
Shut up! Get away from me!

514
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:16,019
Oh, hey!

515
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,848
Tell us the truth.

516
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:19,986
Are these really yours?

517
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:23,593
I told you they are.
I have many of them at my home.

518
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:25,767
Would you like to come with me to see?

519
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,406
Hold on.

520
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:30,497
Those look like my panties.

521
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:34,973
I'm right. These are mine!

522
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:36,633
They're yours? Really?

523
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:39,565
What did you say? Jesus, that can't be.

524
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:43,755
Those hot, red, sexy lace panties

525
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:45,352
do not belong to Yoon Ah?

526
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:46,535
You must be crazy.

527
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:48,144
Damn it!

528
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:51,843
Why are you disappointed?
I thought they were yours!

529
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,980
You punk. Get over here!

530
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,880
Are you a total pervert?

531
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,191
A pervert? Aren't you being too severe?

532
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,500
I am so offended that
I must leave this place.

533
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,148
How could they not be Yoon Ah's?

534
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,440
- Oh no.
- Where do you think you're going?

535
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,865
Ouch!

536
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:19,753
What is this?

537
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:22,234
"I can't forget the taste."

538
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:24,944
"Sweet Whip"?

539
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:27,868
This guy really is a pervert.

540
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:30,816
What do you mean by pervert?
Also, that's not mine.

541
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:32,755
If it's not yours, whose is it?

542
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:33,994
Huh, huh, huh?

543
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,957
It really isn't mine. Believe me!

544
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:37,720
Why, you scoundrel...

545
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:40,263
This won't do, Dong Gu. Call the cops.

546
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:41,349
Yeah, call the cops.

547
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,238
The cops? Hold on!

548
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:46,689
Okay, I'll be honest.

549
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:50,897
I stole these panties.
I'll admit to that.

550
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:55,298
However, that CD is not mine.
You have to believe me.

551
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:58,739
If it's not yours,
then whose is it?

552
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,491
Speak up.

553
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,198
I saw it fall from your hand.

554
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:15,536
What? You're saying
it belongs to Doo Shik?

555
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:18,355
Do you know how innocent this guy is?

556
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:24,057
He's like a clean, white paper
that hasn't even held a girl's hand yet.

557
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:25,803
Why won't you believe me?

558
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:27,631
I saw it fall out of your...

559
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:29,250
Shut your mouth, you punk!

560
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,990
Do I look like I'd watch this crap?

561
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,480
What do you take me for?

562
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,032
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
I said shut up!

563
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:38,029
You're dead, you pervert. Follow me.

564
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,748
- It wasn't me.
- Be quiet!

565
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:44,076
- Dong Gu!
- Get him!

566
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:48,124
This scene would work best
if you did it yourself.

567
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,477
I told you already.

568
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:54,904
I promised my parents that
I would never film a bed scene!

569
00:27:54,904 --> 00:27:57,094
I was just making a suggestion.

570
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,113
Hello, I'm here.

571
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:10,962
Wow! He really lost a lot of weight.

572
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:12,823
How much did you lose?

573
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:15,432
- 10 kilograms.
- What?

574
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:16,538
10 kilograms.

575
00:28:16,538 --> 00:28:18,576
Ah... 10 kilograms.

576
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:21,286
Wow, you must've
suffered a lot. Good job.

577
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:24,365
No, it was nothing.

578
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:31,501
Oh, Soo Jung.

579
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,093
Be careful.

580
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:35,657
Joon Ki, it's okay. You're almost there.

581
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:38,028
Joon Ki, you can do it.

582
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,617
Hello.

583
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:55,691
I'm Lee Joon Ki who will be
doing this scene with you.

584
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:59,601
It's an honor to meet you.

585
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,161
Is that so?

586
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:04,690
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

587
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,565
Director.

588
00:29:12,287 --> 00:29:13,846
Who is this woman?

589
00:29:13,846 --> 00:29:16,499
Oh, she's Soo Jung's stand-in
for the bed scene.

590
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:18,113
Stand-in?

591
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:21,672
Shin Soo Jung isn't doing it?

592
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:25,397
Did you think you were shooting
the bed scene with Shin Soo Jung?

593
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:26,772
Oh...

594
00:29:28,973 --> 00:29:30,836
<i>Shin Soo Jung!</i>

595
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:35,621
<i>Bed scene!</i>

596
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:39,451
What's wrong, Joon Ki?

597
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:44,025
- Director.
- Huh?

598
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:46,111
Soo Jung just called.

599
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:49,522
She feels that using a stand-in
isn't right to the viewers.

600
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:52,806
She says she will
film the bed scene herself.

601
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:53,884
Really?

602
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:56,641
That's good news for me.

603
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:59,664
Looks like you will be doing
the bed scene with Soo Jung.

604
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,933
- Get ready.
- Yes, Director.

605
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,622
I'll get ready quickly.

606
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:04,411
- Wait, Director.
- Yeah?

607
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:06,240
What?

608
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,198
I will do that bed scene.

609
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:17,340
Why are you suddenly doing the bed scene?

610
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,098
I just suddenly changed my mind.

611
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:21,634
Why now of all times?

612
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:24,390
Director, can you take him away?

613
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,575
Hurry, hurry.

614
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:29,661
You're doing this to do a bed scene
with Shin Soo Jung, aren't you?

615
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,627
I know everything, you jerk!

616
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:34,342
I worked so hard for this!

617
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:38,006
What did I say?
I told you he was weird.

618
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:41,747
There was the underwear,
but he said that CD was yours too.

619
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:43,715
- Don't you agree?
- Huh?

620
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:45,974
Yeah. I know.

621
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,836
Anyway, sorry for doubting you.

622
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:50,096
We thought you were jealous
because you liked Yoon Ah.

623
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:53,096
Hey, does it make sense
for me to like Yoon Ah?

624
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:54,811
Also, jealousy?

625
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,122
Goodness, how absurd.

626
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,963
What was that?

627
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:04,796
Isn’t that Joon Ki?
Why isn't he at the film shoot?

628
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,674
I don't know.
Why is he acting crazy?

629
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:08,535
Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

630
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,615
What's going on with him?

631
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:11,982
Excuse me.

632
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:16,214
I go to the same academy as Yoon Ah.

633
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:17,875
Is Yoon Ah home?

634
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,295
Yes, why do you need to see her?

635
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,357
I wanted to ask her out on a date.

636
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:25,394
Ah...

637
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:27,595
a date.

638
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,464
But, did you know this about her?

639
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:31,922
What?

640
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,346
The truth about Yoon Ah is...

641
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:39,491
That bastard!

642
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:43,342
Soo Jung said she would do the shoot
and he steals it away from me?

643
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:45,964
I worked so hard to lose that weight.

644
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,892
Yoon Ah, you're home?

645
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:54,396
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that way?

646
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:58,105
There are some strange rumors
about me in my class.

647
00:31:58,105 --> 00:32:00,747
People say that
I'm addicted to plastic surgery.

648
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:02,920
What? Addicted to plastic surgery?

649
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,640
Yes, and I heard people say I have
loans from loans sharks and debts.

650
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,980
There's even a rumor that I'm a man.

651
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,555
That I was in the marines.

652
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,567
And I can bite through steel
with my teeth.

653
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:19,208
What kind of crazy person
would start rumors like that?

654
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,236
I don't know.

655
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:23,758
People were asking me about it.

656
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:25,826
They actually believe it?

657
00:32:26,998 --> 00:32:30,847
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

658
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:36,673
Fine. I did it, okay?

659
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:41,204
It's all for your mom's sake.

660
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:45,123
I'm worried that she'll meet
some sort of pervert and suffer.

661
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:50,508
It's the truth.
Don't get the wrong idea.

662
00:32:56,987 --> 00:33:00,832
There's no one this week too.

663
00:33:00,832 --> 00:33:02,906
Why aren't there any guests lately?

664
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:04,699
Maybe because it's so cold.

665
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:06,828
What if our business goes into ruin?

666
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:11,179
Yeah, the landlady called
about the rent yesterday.

667
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,232
She even sent a certification
of our business contents.

668
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:15,134
It's okay, it's okay.

669
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:16,284
Hi.

670
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:19,988
Pres... President.

671
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:22,218
- What brings you by?
- What else?

672
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:23,538
I came for the unpaid rent.

673
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:25,626
The rent?

674
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:28,212
Business just hasn't
been very good lately.

675
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:30,723
So, you're saying you don't have it?

676
00:33:30,723 --> 00:33:32,265
Get started.

677
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:33,715
- What?
- Start what?

678
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:37,174
- Who are you people?
- Why are you running around?

679
00:33:37,174 --> 00:33:39,411
This is very familiar.

680
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:42,714
- What is this?
- A seizure, seizure...

681
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:44,863
- You can't do this.
- Is this a drama or something?

682
00:33:44,863 --> 00:33:47,394
Is our business really over, Seo Jin?

683
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:49,944
Where's Dong Gu?
When is he coming, Seo Jin?

684
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,144
You can't take that, Mister.

685
00:33:52,144 --> 00:33:55,404
<i>[Marriage Is a Crazy Thing]</i>

686
00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:58,844
I'm home.

687
00:33:58,844 --> 00:34:01,963
Why are you all just sitting there?

688
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:04,824
- President.
- Long time no see, President Kang.

689
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:08,143
- What's with the baby?
- Pardon?

690
00:34:08,684 --> 00:34:12,155
Ah, uh...

691
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:13,873
She's Dong Gu's baby.

692
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:20,063
Dong Gu got in some trouble.

693
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:22,188
He did what?

694
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:26,186
- So, this is his baby?
- Yes.

695
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:29,847
He's already poor and now he has
a baby to take care of.

696
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:34,240
There are the baby diapers,
formula, and so many other costs.

697
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:39,478
We had actually saved up money
to pay you the rent owed.

698
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:43,668
We had to use all of it
because of the baby.

699
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:46,079
Oh my. I see.

700
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:51,496
What about the baby's mom?

701
00:34:51,496 --> 00:34:52,804
The baby's mom?

702
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:55,777
Oh, the mom is...

703
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,786
She ran away.

704
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:01,945
She said she couldn't
live like this any longer.

705
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:10,094
What kind of a mother does that?

706
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:13,335
Yes, we can leave if you tell us to.

707
00:35:13,335 --> 00:35:16,692
However, on these freezing streets

708
00:35:16,692 --> 00:35:19,918
we will be fine,
but what about this baby?

709
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,994
This poor baby.

710
00:35:23,175 --> 00:35:25,940
That isn't our problem.

711
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,188
I think we should forcefully evict.

712
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:31,318
Stop, Lawyer Kim.

713
00:35:31,318 --> 00:35:33,938
I will wait exactly one month.

714
00:35:33,938 --> 00:35:37,554
I'm only doing this for the baby,
so you have to pay me back.

715
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:39,860
Really? Thank you.

716
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,527
Thank you so much!

717
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:43,717
Forget it and just
take good care of the baby.

718
00:35:43,717 --> 00:35:45,949
- Yes.
- Let's go, Lawyer Kim.

719
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,539
You poor baby.

720
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,599
So upsetting.

721
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:56,469
Goodbye.

722
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:59,000
- Bye.
- Have a nice day!

723
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,579
I thought we were getting kicked out.

724
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:04,190
Still, why make up that kind of lie?

725
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,456
What could I do?

726
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,668
Don't you see all those red stickers?

727
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,876
We'd be on streets if I hadn't lied.

728
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,793
What if we get caught later?

729
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:12,938
Why would we?

730
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:15,474
It's not like she's hanging around
the community center here.

731
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,847
What do we do now?

732
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:22,137
We managed to buy one month,
but what do we do next month?

733
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:23,710
We'll figure it out.

734
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,050
It's okay, it's okay.

735
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,483
Oh, Su Ah.

736
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:30,913
Oh, Doo Shik.

737
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:32,617
It's been a long time.

738
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:34,088
Have you been doing well?

739
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:37,668
Yes, pretty much. Is Dong Gu doing okay?

740
00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:40,077
Huh? Yeah, pretty much.

741
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:41,760
Why are you at a real estate place?

742
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,070
I put my place up.

743
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,097
Yoon Seok is opening a few locations
in the US and wants me to come.

744
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:50,527
- How long are you staying?
- One or two years.

745
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:53,054
- I could end up staying there too.
- Oh?

746
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:56,269
I have a lot to prepare,
so I'll get going.

747
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:57,900
- Bye, then.
- Okay.

748
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,195
Bye.

749
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,125
Looks like she might end up
marrying that guy.

750
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,242
Yeah.

751
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:08,030
If Dong Gu finds out,
he'll be down for days.

752
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,836
We don't have to tell him.

753
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:12,443
Why bother telling him
when he's in a good place now?

754
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,980
Oh, isn't that the landlady’s car?

755
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,327
I think you're right.

756
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:21,507
Why is she headed toward our place?

757
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:23,623
I have a bad feeling.

758
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,436
I'm back.

759
00:37:26,436 --> 00:37:27,929
- You're back?
- Yes.

760
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:30,818
- Did you get your wisdom teeth out?
- Yes.

761
00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:33,010
But...

762
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:35,612
what is all of this?

763
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:39,119
It was just some business.

764
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,048
I'll tell you later.

765
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,581
- Does it hurt a lot?
- No.

766
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,302
If only it would stop bleeding.

767
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:50,932
That's how it usually is.

768
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:53,268
You'll have to suffer for a day.

769
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:54,324
Really?

770
00:37:56,494 --> 00:37:58,108
I'd better change the cotton gauze.

771
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:00,726
Where did I put that again?

772
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,840
Here we are.

773
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,307
Hello, did you need a room?

774
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:09,887
I'm not a guest.

775
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,628
- Who are you?
- Pardon me?

776
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:15,277
I'm Han Yoon Ah.

777
00:38:15,277 --> 00:38:17,632
What is it, Sol? Are you hungry?

778
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,463
Should Mommy feed you?

779
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:23,197
- Mom? You're the baby's mom?
- Yes.

780
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:26,842
- When did you return?
- What?

781
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:30,340
- I just got back from the hospital.
- Hospital?

782
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,072
Why were you at the hospital?

783
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:34,268
Ah, for the past few days--

784
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:37,556
Wait, wait!

785
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:39,195
You scared me.

786
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:41,507
Why are you suddenly screaming?

787
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:42,661
Sorry, President.

788
00:38:42,661 --> 00:38:46,222
What brought you back here?

789
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:50,085
I felt so bad for the baby
that I bought some diapers.

790
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:51,726
Why is it so noisy? What's...

791
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:53,382
- President!
- President Kang.

792
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:55,519
When did you find the baby's mom?

793
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,592
Yes, what happened was...

794
00:38:57,592 --> 00:38:59,173
- So--
- By the way...

795
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:01,224
why was she in the hospital?

796
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:04,101
The hospital? Oh, um...

797
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:08,039
So, she was passed out in the hospital.
We brought her home.

798
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:10,248
- That's what happened.
- She passed out?

799
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,746
What's wrong with you?

800
00:39:11,746 --> 00:39:14,447
What? I just...

801
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:18,007
Oh! Blood.

802
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:20,646
Oh, not again.

803
00:39:20,646 --> 00:39:22,005
Ew.

804
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:25,268
Seo Jin, hurry up.

805
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:28,365
- Take Yoon Ah to her room to rest.
- Yes, okay.

806
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:29,858
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

807
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:31,492
- Why?
- Just go on.

808
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:34,054
- Go on with her.
- You need to rest, Yoon Ah.

809
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:35,610
Get some rest.

810
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:38,173
Oh my.

811
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:41,195
How sick is she
that she's vomiting blood?

812
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:43,264
Yes, so it's...

813
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:46,038
No, there's no time for this.
Get her to the hospital.

814
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:47,614
- No, no!
- Why?

815
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:53,248
Well, we brought her home because
the hospital said they can't do anything.

816
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:54,251
What?

817
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:57,349
Then, it's untreatable?

818
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:58,548
What?

819
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,163
Uh, yes.

820
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:04,324
Ter... terminal stage?

821
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:06,715
Yes, yes.

822
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:11,068
How could such a thing
happen to a young person?

823
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:14,940
President Kang, it must be so hard.

824
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,163
What?

825
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:20,094
- Oh, yes.
- Be good to your baby's mom.

826
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:22,815
Make sure she's happy until the end.

827
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:27,114
Have you two even had a wedding?

828
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:29,045
A wedding? Uh...

829
00:40:29,045 --> 00:40:33,809
I suppose you two wouldn't have
had the time to have a wedding.

830
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:37,985
I feel so sorry for the baby's mom.

831
00:40:38,507 --> 00:40:41,612
She'll never get to wear a wedding dress.

832
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:50,963
You should still stay strong,
President Kang.

833
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:53,911
Yes, thank you.

834
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,355
I'll get going.

835
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,623
Thank you for the diapers.
Goodbye, President.

836
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:08,119
Goodbye.

837
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,103
That was a close call.

838
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,329
Why did you have to lie?
We nearly got caught.

839
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:19,614
We got through it.
Nothing will happen.

840
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:21,317
- Don't worry.
- What if we get caught?

841
00:41:21,317 --> 00:41:22,675
Take the diapers.

842
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:26,150
Look at you taking those. Gosh.

843
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:31,523
This is so crazy.

844
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,784
What do you think of this place?

845
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,128
What... what is this?

846
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:39,130
Oh, I want to hold a wedding
for the two of you.

847
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,458
- What?
- What?

848
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:41,733
A wedding?

849
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,086
Don't worry. I'll cover the costs.

850
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:46,989
Oh no. It's okay. It really is.

851
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:49,530
You don't know how women feel.

852
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,550
A woman who doesn't get to wear a
wedding dress will regret it forever.

853
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,360
No, I don't need to wear a wedding dress.

854
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,094
I want to do it for you. I want to.

855
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:03,880
Honestly, I've been busy
making a living for myself.

856
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,329
I never had a wedding with my husband.

857
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:09,313
So, I never got to wear a wedding dress.

858
00:42:09,313 --> 00:42:11,686
Oh, I see.

859
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:14,885
So, I know just how you feel.

860
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:18,884
Don't feel burdened by it
and have the wedding.

861
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:22,286
No, it really is okay.

862
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:25,288
Are you going to continue
rejecting my kind offer?

863
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:28,485
Don't do it then.
Instead, leave the building right away.

864
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:31,110
What? How does that work?

865
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,204
Make a decision.
Lose the business or get married.

866
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,423
We'll do it.

867
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:43,820
We can do it.

868
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,891
You should have said so.

869
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:49,610
I think doing it
as soon as possible is best.

870
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,505
How is Sunday?

871
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:53,644
This coming Sunday?

872
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:58,463
She's not feeling well,
so it'd be best to do it quickly.

873
00:43:02,507 --> 00:43:04,184
Ah, okay.

874
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:05,239
<i>What?</i>

875
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:07,177
She's planning a wedding for you?

876
00:43:07,177 --> 00:43:08,548
That's what I said.

877
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:11,326
Why would you make up
that useless lie and create this mess?

878
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:13,139
I didn't know this would happen.

879
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:16,753
This isn't right at all.
This is marriage fraud.

880
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:19,072
I should go to her and tell the truth.

881
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:20,451
Hey, hey, hey!

882
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:21,949
- What?
- Are you crazy?

883
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,505
Don't you know her temper?

884
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:27,697
If she finds out that we lied,
she'll sue us on top of kicking us out.

885
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:29,728
What am I supposed to do, then?

886
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:35,461
Dong Gu, I'm sorry.

887
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:39,106
Can you just look the other way
and do the wedding?

888
00:43:39,106 --> 00:43:41,570
- Joon Ki!
- You're crazy.

889
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,541
What can we do, then?

890
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:47,199
We can't be kicked out on the street
in this cold weather.

891
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,353
You and Yoon Ah...

892
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,474
just do it.

893
00:43:56,474 --> 00:43:58,811
Stop it, stop it!

894
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,795
We really don't need a ring.
It's okay, President.

895
00:44:03,795 --> 00:44:06,226
I want to get you rings.

896
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,996
Go on and pick one.

897
00:44:10,324 --> 00:44:12,516
Oh, Dong Gu!

898
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:15,795
Oh, Sang Pil.

899
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:21,302
It's been a long time.
Have you been doing well?

900
00:44:21,302 --> 00:44:24,563
Yes, I've been okay.

901
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:26,485
Who is that?

902
00:44:26,485 --> 00:44:28,146
Oh, this...

903
00:44:28,146 --> 00:44:29,893
Ah, your girlfriend?

904
00:44:29,893 --> 00:44:32,047
Well, actually...

905
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,097
Bride and groom, how are these?

906
00:44:34,097 --> 00:44:37,063
This is the most popular design.

907
00:44:37,063 --> 00:44:38,846
Bride and groom?

908
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:41,596
What's this? You're getting married?

909
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,184
Oh, that...

910
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:50,250
Yes, I'm getting married.

911
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,835
Why didn't you contact me?
When is it?

912
00:44:52,835 --> 00:44:55,065
Oh, that.

913
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:58,615
This Sunday.

914
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:01,978
Then you should have contacted me.
You really are something.

915
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:03,672
Don't worry, man.

916
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:06,358
As for all our classmates, seniors,
juniors, and professors

917
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:09,418
I'll bring them all,
even the club members.

918
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:11,757
Congratulations on
getting married, Dong Gu.

919
00:45:11,757 --> 00:45:15,650
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

920
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,449
I'm so thankful, I could cry.

921
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,349
I'm going crazy.

922
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:24,972
Why did I have to see Sang Pil there?

923
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,056
Oh, Sang Pil.

924
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,512
Sergeant Kang?

925
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:30,425
Oh, Officer Kim.

926
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:31,771
.

927
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:33,715
How have you been?

928
00:45:33,715 --> 00:45:35,079
Pretty good.

929
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:37,070
- It's been a long time.
- President Kang.

930
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,177
How's this?

931
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:41,385
You have to wear a tuxedo
for your wedding, right?

932
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:43,784
- Yes.
- A wedding?

933
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:45,715
Are you getting married?

934
00:45:45,715 --> 00:45:49,054
Oh, the thing is...

935
00:45:50,896 --> 00:45:52,496
Yes, I'm getting married.

936
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:53,974
Really? When?

937
00:45:53,974 --> 00:45:56,106
- This Sunday.
- Sunday?

938
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:59,275
You should've told me earlier.
I feel a little hurt.

939
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:03,253
Don't feel hurt.
There is a reason for it.

940
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:06,768
A reason? What is it?

941
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:13,663
What? How did things end up like that?

942
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:15,217
Stay strong, Sergeant Kang.

943
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:17,271
Yeah, thanks.

944
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:19,938
You are doing a great thing.

945
00:46:19,938 --> 00:46:21,639
This is a warm, touching story.

946
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:23,740
I don't know about that.

947
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,170
I only want these two to be happy.

948
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:32,219
Anyway, I will contact
our platoon and squadron.

949
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:34,940
Oh no. There's no need for that.

950
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,739
Hey now, we should be together
when things are tough.

951
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:40,121
Like being loyal in battle, right?

952
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:41,898
That's right!

953
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:46,275
All right. Thanks.

954
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:50,005
You are full of loyalty in battle.

955
00:46:52,871 --> 00:46:55,309
This is really crazy.

956
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:57,384
Does marrying make sense?

957
00:47:03,744 --> 00:47:06,585
You're laughing? You can actually laugh?

958
00:47:06,585 --> 00:47:08,847
It's just kind of amazing.

959
00:47:08,847 --> 00:47:10,253
What is?

960
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:12,724
I imagined these things
a lot when I was younger.

961
00:47:12,724 --> 00:47:14,516
"Where will I get married
when I grow up?"

962
00:47:14,516 --> 00:47:18,942
"What kind of wedding dress will I wear
and what kind of bouquet will I have?"

963
00:47:18,942 --> 00:47:21,335
I gave up on all of that after I had Sol.

964
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:24,797
Somehow, I'm having a wedding.

965
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:30,916
Oh, I'm tired from going here
and there all day, aren't you?

966
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:32,545
I don't know.

967
00:47:32,545 --> 00:47:36,375
I went around in such a daze
that I can't even feel fatigue.

968
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:39,262
I wish this was all a dream.

969
00:47:40,545 --> 00:47:44,204
Yoon Ah, should we tell her the truth...

970
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:48,190
What's this?
You fell asleep in that time?

971
00:47:48,746 --> 00:47:53,076
Geez, life is so
simple for you, isn't it?

972
00:47:53,076 --> 00:47:55,858
Oh, gosh.

973
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:58,045
Gosh.

974
00:48:25,407 --> 00:48:27,346
Pillow.

975
00:48:27,346 --> 00:48:29,445
Geez.

976
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:34,360
This lady requires so much care.

977
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:41,750
We're home.

978
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:45,661
Here comes the new groom.

979
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,931
I was just joking. It was a joke.

980
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:51,266
You looked down,
so I was trying to make you feel better.

981
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:52,282
How can you joke?

982
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:54,442
Do you know what happened to me today?

983
00:48:54,442 --> 00:48:57,822
Do you know what kind of
huge mess you've created?

984
00:48:57,822 --> 00:48:59,795
Hold on, here. What is this?

985
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:01,320
Isn't this President Kim?

986
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,329
What is it?

987
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:03,911
There's an article about her.

988
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:06,190
What kind of article?

989
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,775
"President Kim of Huam-dong
is melting this cold winter."

990
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:13,163
"Couple Kang Dong Gu and Han Yoon Ah
who can't pay rent and run a guest house"

991
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:15,280
"will have their wedding
paid for by President Kim."

992
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,599
Who wrote this article?

993
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,550
Who would write such a thing?

994
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,737
Reporter Kim Tae Yong?

995
00:49:21,737 --> 00:49:23,137
I became a reporter.

996
00:49:23,137 --> 00:49:24,454
Officer Kim!

997
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:26,800
That crazy idiot.
Why would he write this?

998
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,664
Why doesn't he write something else?

999
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:30,284
Hello, this is Waikiki.

1000
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:31,603
<i>Yes, hello.</i>

1001
00:49:31,603 --> 00:49:34,005
Hello, this is the singer, Wheesung.

1002
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,362
What? Singer, Wheesung?

1003
00:49:36,362 --> 00:49:37,565
- Wheesung?
- Wrong number.

1004
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:40,186
<i>No, I really am Wheesung. I really am.</i>

1005
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,784
Oh, really?

1006
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:44,175
- Hello, I'm Park Hyo Shin.
- What?

1007
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:46,547
<i>Let's have a song battle.</i>

1008
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:49,583
<i>Good person.</i>

1009
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:52,514
<i>Even if we part...</i>

1010
00:49:52,514 --> 00:49:54,277
Don't prank call. Hang up.

1011
00:49:54,277 --> 00:50:00,105
<i>I even thought of marrying you.</i>

1012
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:04,119
It really sounds like him.
What is this about?

1013
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:08,969
You read the article?

1014
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:12,599
What? You want to
sing a song at the wedding?

1015
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:13,659
It's really Wheesung?

1016
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:16,548
Wheesung, hold on.
I have another call.

1017
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:18,728
Hello, this is Waikiki.

1018
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:20,557
Designer Park Sool Nyeo?

1019
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:22,168
- What?
- What?

1020
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:24,297
You want to give them hanbok to wear?

1021
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:26,818
This is becoming a big blockbuster.

1022
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:30,684
We can't live in this country
if we get caught.

1023
00:50:30,684 --> 00:50:32,373
People will beat us to death.

1024
00:50:32,373 --> 00:50:35,085
Who? Chef Lee Yeon Bok?

1025
00:50:42,565 --> 00:50:45,588
<i>[We will not be receiving gifts.]</i>

1026
00:50:49,927 --> 00:50:53,311
Dong Gu! Congratulations!

1027
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,438
Thank you. You really brought everyone.

1028
00:50:55,438 --> 00:50:57,110
- Yes.
- Looks good.

1029
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,867
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

1030
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:01,574
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1031
00:51:01,574 --> 00:51:03,813
- Go on in.
- Congratulations!

1032
00:51:06,407 --> 00:51:07,775
Let's give him a salute.

1033
00:51:07,775 --> 00:51:09,974
To the new groom!

1034
00:51:09,974 --> 00:51:11,302
Unity!

1035
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:12,516
Unity.

1036
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:14,074
Sergeant Kang.

1037
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:17,302
Officer Kim, I read your article.

1038
00:51:17,302 --> 00:51:18,766
Congratulations.

1039
00:51:18,766 --> 00:51:20,356
Hey, congrats!

1040
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:21,673
Thank you.

1041
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:22,916
- Congratulations.
- Congrats!

1042
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,425
- You look good.
- So handsome.

1043
00:51:25,425 --> 00:51:28,121
- Congratulations.
- We'll be inside.

1044
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:29,347
Thank you.

1045
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:34,054
Uh... are you okay, Dong Gu?

1046
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:36,195
Do I look okay to you?

1047
00:51:36,195 --> 00:51:39,320
My college classmates,
professors, army friends...

1048
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,110
Even the chairman of the women's group.

1049
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,280
I really am a married man now.

1050
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,545
At least everyone is talking about
how pretty the bride is.

1051
00:51:47,545 --> 00:51:50,076
You haven't seen Yoon Ah
in her dress, have you?

1052
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:52,780
Awesome. So pretty.
Really awesome!

1053
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,288
What about it?

1054
00:51:54,288 --> 00:51:55,972
I should be happy about a pretty wife?

1055
00:51:55,972 --> 00:51:59,704
Wow, I'm so happy about my pretty wife.

1056
00:51:59,704 --> 00:52:00,860
Calm down.

1057
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,070
Calm? Do you think I can be calm?
This is your fault.

1058
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,650
You're not even a friend.

1059
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,878
- You're an enemy.
- What are you all doing?

1060
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:11,297
It's almost time to start the wedding.

1061
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:12,768
Hurry on in.

1062
00:52:12,768 --> 00:52:15,244
- Yes, we'll be there.
- We should start soon.

1063
00:52:15,244 --> 00:52:17,693
I have to go in first.

1064
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:19,536
- See you later, Dong Gu.
- Bye.

1065
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:22,088
- Do a good job.
- Get ready.

1066
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,831
<i>Okay.</i>

1067
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:32,891
<i>Starting now, we will start the union
of groom Kang Dong Gu</i>

1068
00:52:32,891 --> 00:52:38,949
and the bride Han Yoon Ah.

1069
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:41,726
Groom, please enter.

1070
00:52:50,277 --> 00:52:52,327
You should salute.

1071
00:52:54,126 --> 00:52:56,369
You look good!

1072
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,681
You're doing well.

1073
00:52:58,681 --> 00:53:00,846
He wasn't so good in the army.

1074
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:03,876
Isn't the groom strong?

1075
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:13,222
Now, today's real star.

1076
00:53:13,222 --> 00:53:19,583
February's bride.
Please applaud for Han Yoon Ah.

1077
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,286
Bride, please enter.

1078
00:54:02,253 --> 00:54:03,927
Salute to the bride!

1079
00:54:03,927 --> 00:54:06,969
Unity!

1080
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:12,646
She's really pretty.

1081
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:28,269
Dong Gu, Dong Gu...

1082
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:30,440
Kang Dong Gu.

1083
00:54:41,597 --> 00:54:46,070
<i>Love is delicious. Love is precious.</i>

1084
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:51,759
<i>Split in half
and share it with each other.</i>

1085
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:56,208
<i>Always keep it in your heart.</i>

1086
00:54:56,208 --> 00:55:00,954
<i>Spend every moment together.</i>

1087
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:03,936
Thank you. Thank you.

1088
00:55:03,936 --> 00:55:05,105
Wheesung.

1089
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:09,815
I truly want to congratulate you
and pray that you'll be happy forever.

1090
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:12,425
I usually cost more money.

1091
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:14,465
I sang for free today.

1092
00:55:14,465 --> 00:55:16,070
In return...

1093
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:21,025
I would like to request
a passionate kiss from the couple.

1094
00:55:24,565 --> 00:55:26,472
A passionate kiss, yes.

1095
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:28,313
Don't try to back out now.

1096
00:55:28,313 --> 00:55:36,994
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

1097
00:55:36,994 --> 00:55:38,706
This is crazy.

1098
00:55:38,706 --> 00:55:44,253
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!

1099
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:49,001
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

1100
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:50,853
Dong Gu, just do it.

1101
00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:53,737
- What?
- Let's just kiss.

1102
00:55:53,737 --> 00:55:56,295
How can we just kiss?

1103
00:56:28,057 --> 00:56:31,367
Enjoy your honeymoon.

1104
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:36,588
Use this to buy your wife
whatever she wants.

1105
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:38,677
Yes. Thank you.

1106
00:56:38,677 --> 00:56:41,280
You should get going.

1107
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,483
Have a nice trip.

1108
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,143
Yes, we'll get going.

1109
00:56:46,143 --> 00:56:48,512
Shall we get going, Yoon Ah...

1110
00:56:48,512 --> 00:56:50,351
I mean, Honey.

1111
00:56:52,498 --> 00:56:56,097
Let's do that, Honey.

1112
00:57:07,018 --> 00:57:08,646
Yes.

1113
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,885
Dong Gu.

1114
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,402
Dong Gu?

1115
00:57:30,972 --> 00:57:32,115
- Dong Gu.
- Huh?

1116
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,440
Why? What?

1117
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,409
- What have you been thinking about?
- What?

1118
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:39,387
I wasn't thinking about anything.

1119
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:45,476
How long do we have to wait here?

1120
00:57:46,581 --> 00:57:51,347
They said they'd call once she left,
so let's wait a little bit.

1121
00:57:52,311 --> 00:57:54,543
Oh, President Kang.

1122
00:57:55,981 --> 00:57:59,032
- Lawyer Kim.
- What are you doing here?

1123
00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:01,690
Oh, you're going on your honeymoon.

1124
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,128
Yes, I am.

1125
00:58:03,128 --> 00:58:05,572
Oh, yeah. You're going
to Jeju Island, aren't you?

1126
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:07,813
I'm going there on a business trip.

1127
00:58:07,813 --> 00:58:09,581
What time is your flight?

1128
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:12,902
It's the 6:30 pm flight.

1129
00:58:12,902 --> 00:58:15,643
Mine is at 6:30 pm too.

1130
00:58:15,643 --> 00:58:17,333
We're on the same plane.

1131
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:20,353
We're sitting next to each other.
That's amazing.

1132
00:58:20,353 --> 00:58:22,824
It's time to go. Let's go.

1133
00:58:24,432 --> 00:58:26,043
Dong Gu, what do we do?

1134
00:58:26,043 --> 00:58:28,340
I don't know. I'm going crazy.

1135
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,851
Hurry up.

1136
00:58:37,574 --> 00:58:40,960
Their flight probably landed by now.

1137
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,985
I hope they had a nice trip
and she wasn't sick.

1138
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:46,757
What's this?

1139
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:50,012
This slippery, bad feeling.

1140
00:58:52,248 --> 00:58:56,230
What kind of dog pooped here?

1141
00:58:59,722 --> 00:59:02,065
The house feels empty without  those two.

1142
00:59:02,065 --> 00:59:03,400
I know.

1143
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,164
Dong Gu and Yoon Ah must be back.
Should we go pick them up?

1144
00:59:06,164 --> 00:59:07,478
Why bother?

1145
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:09,643
It's not a real honeymoon.
Why should we pick them up?

1146
00:59:09,643 --> 00:59:12,739
How did they happen to meet
Lawyer Kim at the airport?

1147
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:14,192
I know.

1148
00:59:14,192 --> 00:59:15,297
Do you think...

1149
00:59:15,297 --> 00:59:17,637
Dong Gu and Yoon Ah will
develop feelings for each other?

1150
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,086
I doubt it.

1151
00:59:19,086 --> 00:59:22,085
It's just a relief that we didn't
get caught by President Kim.

1152
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:28,253
I never dreamed that she would think
Dong Gu and Yoon Ah were married.

1153
00:59:30,018 --> 00:59:32,014
- What do you mean?
- Oh my gosh!

1154
00:59:32,014 --> 00:59:33,088
President Kim.

1155
00:59:33,088 --> 00:59:36,070
What are they if
they're not a married couple?

1156
00:59:37,693 --> 00:59:40,900
You didn't lie to me, did you?

1157
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,324
That's not it, President Kim...

1158
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:44,273
Tell me the truth now!

1159
00:59:44,273 --> 00:59:47,429
President Kim, President Kim.

1160
00:59:49,893 --> 00:59:52,760
I'm sorry, President Kim.
It wasn't on purpose and honestly--

1161
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,284
Shut your mouth
and put your print on that.

1162
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,478
What is this?

1163
00:59:59,478 --> 01:00:01,954
Payment contract regarding wedding costs.

1164
01:00:01,954 --> 01:00:03,934
If you can't repay it in one month

1165
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:07,456
this is a polite warning that
something scary could happen.

1166
01:00:07,456 --> 01:00:10,030
By something scary,
what do you mean by that?

1167
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,902
Multiply it by 100.

1168
01:00:11,902 --> 01:00:16,023
Think of the most terrible thing you can.

1169
01:00:16,023 --> 01:00:20,592
I would like to stick you all in jail.

1170
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:26,376
I'm stopping at this
because I feel bad for the baby.

1171
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,936
Put your fingerprint on it now.

1172
01:00:28,936 --> 01:00:33,445
Still, how can we pay
all of this back in one month?

1173
01:00:33,445 --> 01:00:36,327
Do you want to go to jail?

1174
01:00:37,637 --> 01:00:39,570
I just need to put my print here?

1175
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,838
What will you do now?

1176
01:00:56,838 --> 01:00:59,539
There are no guests and you have a debt.

1177
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:01,699
I don't know.

1178
01:01:02,628 --> 01:01:05,809
This is all because of that guy,
Lee Joon Ki.

1179
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:09,668
I'm going home and I won't
let him get away with it.

1180
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,686
That was so scary.

1181
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:28,271
He could cause an accident.
Why is he going so fast?

1182
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,864
Dong Gu?

1183
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,268
Dong Gu.

1184
01:01:47,632 --> 01:01:49,532
Can you hear me?

1185
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,936
Can you hear me?

1186
01:01:55,608 --> 01:01:57,045
Huh... what?

1187
01:01:57,045 --> 01:01:59,617
What? Did you say something?

1188
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:03,141
No, I was just saying thank you.

1189
01:02:03,996 --> 01:02:08,106
You should look straight ahead
when you're walking.

1190
01:02:08,106 --> 01:02:12,213
You really need to be
taken care of all the time.

1191
01:02:12,213 --> 01:02:13,840
Come on.

1192
01:02:15,824 --> 01:02:18,507
You may as well close your eyes then.

1193
01:02:20,315 --> 01:02:22,554
Wait up, Dong Gu.

1194
01:02:31,851 --> 01:02:33,273
Su Ah.

1195
01:02:36,731 --> 01:02:38,358
Dong Gu.

1196
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:42,795
You...

1197
01:02:43,782 --> 01:02:47,750
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

1198
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,860
What do I do, Dong Gu?

1199
