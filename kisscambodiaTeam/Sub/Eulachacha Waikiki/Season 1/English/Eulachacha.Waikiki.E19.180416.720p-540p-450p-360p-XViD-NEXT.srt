1
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:12,985
I'm truly sorry,

2
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,985
but it's just that this is a really important opportunity for me.

3
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,895
Can you be understanding just once more?

4
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,320
All right.

5
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:23,465
Really? Really?

6
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:25,465
You're not upset, are you?

7
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:27,530
No, I'm not upset.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,930
You're not lying, are you? Are you really okay?

9
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:31,775
Yes, I'm really fine.

10
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,775
Thank you Seo Jin. I really appreciate it.

11
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,675
Then I'll see you at home later. Okay?

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,415
I'm all right.

13
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,755
Really.

14
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:51,025
I'm really all right.

15
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:56,550
What? You're making a contract with YS entertainment?

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,890
Yes.

17
00:00:57,894 --> 00:01:01,930
That's great news! It's a big company with famous celebrities.

18
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:05,305
People are finally realizing my talents as an actor now.

19
00:01:06,703 --> 00:01:07,905
Really?

20
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,415
Right. Seo Jin.

21
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:13,415
I'm sorry for bailing on you today.

22
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,440
No, It's fine.

23
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:16,855
It was for work.

24
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:19,440
And you had to go through so much trouble without management.

25
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:20,625
Congratulations.

26
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:21,985
Thanks.

27
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:25,725
Jun Ki, you might really become famous now.

28
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,650
Maybe I should get your signature in advance.

29
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:32,335
I've been practicing my new sign. Do you want one?

30
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:33,860
Sure.

31
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:36,005
Okay. In that case,

32
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:39,635
I'll give you my first signature.

33
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:46,815
Lee...

34
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:17,515
Gosh, I fell asleep.

35
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:22,240
Jun Ki, isn't it finished yet?

36
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:23,940
Just wait a bit longer.

37
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:25,955
- Then I'll go to my room now. - What?

38
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:29,080
I need to study to get my baking certificate.

39
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:30,425
Really?

40
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,725
When I'm done with this, I'll take it to your room.

41
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:34,950
Okay.

42
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,065
Now that the "Lee" part is over...

43
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:43,165
Jun...

44
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:58,485
(The Dancer in the Dark)

45
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,085
Yes, Father.

46
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:05,095
I'm going to sign the contract.

47
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:09,695
Don't worry. I've read the contract in detail.

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,705
Yes. I'll call you afterwards. Okay.

49
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:16,430
What did he say? Is he happy?

50
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes. He doesn't show it,

51
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:21,075
but I can feel how happy he is.

52
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,475
I didn't expect this day to come.

53
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:25,400
You've finally turned your life around, right?

54
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:26,745
Right.

55
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,515
I went through a lot for 10 years while working as a nameless actor.

56
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:32,215
Well, you did go through a lot.

57
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:37,125
- You're going to act like that? - Tell me, you scum.

58
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:38,750
I got fired again.

59
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,965
With ink like this...

60
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,595
Gosh, even thinking about that is horrible.

61
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:46,065
- I'm going now. - Bye.

62
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:51,500
Where did Soo Ah go after making me answer...

63
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,275
all these inquiries on the shopping mall?

64
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,205
Du Shik! Du Shik!

65
00:03:58,007 --> 00:03:59,940
- Look at this. - Why the fuss?

66
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:02,470
- What is it? - I designed it myself.

67
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,585
If we only resell products, we won't be able to go further.

68
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,755
So you want to sell clothes that you've designed?

69
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:11,455
Yes. Do you want to see it?

70
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:13,895
Look.

71
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,795
It's Soorgio Armhany 2018 SS vintage collection,

72
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:20,430
Ultra-V-Neck Sweater. What do you think?

73
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,375
Well, but why is the chest part so exposed?

74
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:28,700
Normal V-necks are so normal, and they're not sexy.

75
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:32,670
This one has the V-neck line further down just above the navel.

76
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:35,015
It emphasizes sexiness.

77
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,610
What do you think? Isn't it cool?

78
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,885
It's cool, but I think...

79
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:40,980
it's too exposed.

80
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:42,910
No, it's fine.

81
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,455
People like unconventional designs nowadays.

82
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,925
But why aren't you wearing it?

83
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,265
What?

84
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,660
You want me to wear it? Why?

85
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:55,330
You're the model. We should take a picture and upload it.

86
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,660
What? Me?

87
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,260
When, where, what, how, and why?

88
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:00,400
You should just do it if your boss says so.

89
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,330
- Be quiet, and follow me. - Why me?

90
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:04,170
I'm busy, you bad boss.

91
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:07,545
- Follow me! - No, it will show my naval.

92
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,750
What do you think? Do you like the conditions?

93
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:18,380
Yes, it's all good.

94
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,425
In that case, sign it.

95
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:22,925
Should I?

96
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:31,275
Lee...

97
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,115
Jun...

98
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:45,385
- Isn't it done yet? - Jun...

99
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:49,685
Ki...

100
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:54,795
It's done now.

101
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:56,195
Really?

102
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,865
I look forward to working with you.

103
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:00,935
Thank you. I look forward to it too.

104
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:05,930
So... See here.

105
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:09,370
The baby tiger and the daddy tiger...

106
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:12,940
lived together happily ever after.

107
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,285
The end.

108
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:18,915
Sol, what do you think the point of this story is?

109
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,750
The point of this story is "daddy".

110
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:26,155
Say "daddy".

111
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:29,825
Gosh, you're not easy, are you?

112
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:34,035
Sol, please say "daddy".

113
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:36,290
Just once? Please?

114
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:38,905
- Say "daddy". - What are you doing?

115
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:42,605
Nothing. I was reading a book for Sol.

116
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:49,345
What is that? It looks like something a cool beggar would wear.

117
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,340
What? A cool beggar?

118
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:54,285
It looks like it'd be really cool if you wore it.

119
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,150
Where did you buy that?

120
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:57,380
I didn't buy this.

121
00:06:57,387 --> 00:06:59,820
Soo Ah designed this herself.

122
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:02,220
What? Soo Ah makes clothes now?

123
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:03,420
Yes.

124
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:06,460
That's not the end. She wants me to wear it around for publicity.

125
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:09,865
Gosh, Min Soo Ah is definitely crazy.

126
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,430
- I'm home. - Hello.

127
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,170
Hello. How was the contract?

128
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,605
It was okay.

129
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:19,715
What is that? It looks like something a cool beggar would wear.

130
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,870
He says Soo Ah designed it.

131
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,515
Isn't it funny?

132
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,050
It's so funny. I can see your naval.

133
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,985
You're so open-minded. Gosh.

134
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:30,925
Seriously. Stop.

135
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:36,495
What is this? Why did you stop talking when I arrived?

136
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,460
You were saying bad things about me, weren't you?

137
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,765
No.

138
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:43,065
We were complimenting your clothes.

139
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,860
He's right.

140
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:48,075
It's great. It makes Du Shik look so much better.

141
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:51,400
Really? Do you like it that much?

142
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:52,915
- What? - What?

143
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,315
Now, look at you two.

144
00:07:57,747 --> 00:07:58,885
Be quiet.

145
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:00,725
What is this?

146
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,680
You guys look like three cool beggar brothers.

147
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,595
- Don't they? - They do.

148
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:10,220
You look cool and sexy, Dong Gu.

149
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:13,135
Why are you doing that, Yoon Ah? It's so embarrassing.

150
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:14,735
What is this?

151
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:17,600
But why is Soo Ah suddenly into designing?

152
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,375
I don't know. She's so passionate,

153
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:23,205
so I can't tell her it's weird. Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

154
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:25,975
But still, what is this? Gosh.

155
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:28,070
- Right, Yoon Ah? - Exactly.

156
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:30,485
It's a bit too extreme, right?

157
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:31,755
- It's... - Stop.

158
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:33,315
Hey, you were all here.

159
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,355
What is this? Why are you all quiet again?

160
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:40,180
You've been saying bad things about me, haven't you?

161
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:41,250
Of course not.

162
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:43,250
We were saying...

163
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,890
the sweater you designed looked awesome.

164
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:47,730
That's right. They look so sophisticated.

165
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,035
It's so pretty.

166
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:51,375
Really? You like it that much?

167
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,875
What is this?

168
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,345
The sleeves are...

169
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,310
just too long.

170
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,940
Oh, it's...

171
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:06,680
a part of Soorgio Armhany's 2018 SS Cutie Collection.

172
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,380
It's called Bongsan Number Five.

173
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:11,495
It was inspired by the Bongsan mask dance.

174
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,195
I see.

175
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:17,920
But aren't the sleeves a bit too long?

176
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:21,435
That's the point.

177
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:24,730
Existing hoodies look so boring.

178
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:27,770
By adding extremely long sleeves,

179
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,575
I gave the hoodie a cute look.

180
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:32,375
What do you think? Isn't it so cute?

181
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:35,070
It is. Thank you.

182
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:36,170
You're welcome.

183
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,380
Just wear it every day...

184
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,410
so people can see it, okay?

185
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,455
- Okay. - Okay.

186
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:44,495
- We will. - Of course.

187
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,525
Hello.

188
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,095
Yes.

189
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:49,625
What?

190
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:51,265
Me?

191
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,965
Okay.

192
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,300
Who was it?

193
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,205
It was the director of my agency.

194
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:01,705
Choi Min Sik was supposed to throw the first pitch,

195
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,645
but he caught the flu.

196
00:10:03,873 --> 00:10:07,115
So the director wants me to do it instead.

197
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:11,640
- You'll throw the first pitch? - For a professional game?

198
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:14,010
- Yes. - Congratulations.

199
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:16,350
Only real celebrities get to do that.

200
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:17,495
I know.

201
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,995
I guess this is a perk of having an agency.

202
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:23,325
- I'll throw the first pitch. - I can't believe it.

203
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:24,835
Congratulations.

204
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:28,305
Let's go over first pitches that attracted a lot of attention.

205
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,035
Clara's leggings.

206
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:32,305
Cheng Xiao's 360° turn.

207
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:35,275
Shin Soo Ji's acrobatic first pitch.

208
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:36,900
After their first pitches,

209
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,940
their images improved by 13-fold.

210
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:42,940
And the awareness increased by 20-fold.

211
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,415
Really?

212
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,225
They hold a meeting for the first pitch?

213
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,295
A big company sure is different.

214
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:54,325
We need something new and different.

215
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,750
Do you have any ideas?

216
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:59,265
Jun Ki is playing an anchor in the drama.

217
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:02,560
He could dress like Sohn Suk Hee...

218
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:05,060
and throw a ball that looks like a microphone.

219
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,800
That sounds boring.

220
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:08,175
Do you have any other ideas?

221
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:09,905
No?

222
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:13,645
There are so many of us. How can we have no other ideas?

223
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:19,655
Honey.

224
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,725
What?

225
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:25,320
You want to learn pole dancing?

226
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:28,150
Sure. Do whatever you want.

227
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:29,795
Okay.

228
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:32,965
Hold on.

229
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:35,265
Pole dance?

230
00:11:42,171 --> 00:11:43,245
Well...

231
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:46,975
You want me to practice pole dancing here?

232
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:50,415
The director doesn't want it to leak to the press.

233
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,040
Confidentiality is everything.

234
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:54,610
But a pole dancing first pitch just sounds weird.

235
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:56,880
I can't throw a ball while pole dancing.

236
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:57,980
It doesn't make sense.

237
00:11:57,987 --> 00:12:00,495
What can we do? It's the director's idea.

238
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:02,920
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

239
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:05,060
Should we start practicing?

240
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:08,360
I'll demonstrate for you. Watch carefully.

241
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:09,505
Okay.

242
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:13,875
Gosh.

243
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,275
What do you think? Doesn't it look easy?

244
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,485
No. I can't do this.

245
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:23,745
Please excuse me.

246
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:27,425
Come on. Practice makes perfect.

247
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,250
Let's start from hanging.

248
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:30,825
Hanging?

249
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:37,420
Be serious.

250
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:39,065
Use your arms. Try again.

251
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:43,905
It's hot. Hey.

252
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,075
Again.

253
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:47,805
Again.

254
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:51,000
Ma'am!

255
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:54,385
Help me! Ma'am!

256
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:56,945
Gosh, it's killing me.

257
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,615
Gosh.

258
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:02,425
After spending all day on the pole, my whole body aches.

259
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:04,380
Is this really necessary?

260
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:07,320
What can I do? It's the director's idea.

261
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:09,265
I'm worried you'll hurt yourself.

262
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:12,395
It's okay. This is such a great opportunity.

263
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,265
I... Gosh.

264
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:18,075
I'll work hard and become successful...

265
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,500
so that I can give you...

266
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:22,075
anything you want.

267
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:25,645
I'm so touched I want to cry.

268
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:28,385
Bacca.

269
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,885
I don't think pain-relieving patches are enough.

270
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:32,885
I need something else too.

271
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,185
What do you mean?

272
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,320
Gosh.

273
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,255
Why did you hit me?

274
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,150
If you have to hit me, do it with your lips.

275
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,260
Forget it.

276
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,935
- Don't be like that. - Stop.

277
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,205
We're not getting any orders.

278
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,000
Look at that.

279
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:56,045
I knew no one would want that sweater.

280
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,645
I hope no one I know sees this.

281
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,415
I'll have to ask Soo Ah to take down these pictures.

282
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,655
Soo Ah. By the way...

283
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,825
She seems pretty serious.

284
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,125
Did she fall asleep like this?

285
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:22,105
Gosh, it stinks.

286
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:23,835
What did she eat?

287
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26,305
What?

288
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:31,000
Hey. What are you doing here?

289
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,345
I just came by.

290
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:37,270
What is it? Why are you laughing?

291
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,715
Well...

292
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,855
I just farted in my dream.

293
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:46,495
It felt so real.

294
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,925
Of course.

295
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,235
I'm sure it did.

296
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:53,020
Director Bong.

297
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:55,865
Have we gotten any orders for the sweater I designed?

298
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,535
Not yet.

299
00:14:58,667 --> 00:14:59,735
Really?

300
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:02,675
Why isn't anyone buying it?

301
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,775
Is my design that bad?

302
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:08,785
It hasn't been exposed a lot yet.

303
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:10,210
Cheer up.

304
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:11,715
- You think so? - Yes.

305
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:14,115
Should we try to expose it more?

306
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,685
I have an idea.

307
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:26,595
What's that?

308
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,730
This is Soorgio Armhany's new product,

309
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:32,300
Ultra-V-Neck Sweater. Take a look.

310
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:33,330
Here.

311
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:34,530
Take a look.

312
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:38,040
It's so pretty, right? It looks amazing. It's so sexy.

313
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,315
Girls, take a look.

314
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:41,985
Thank you.

315
00:15:42,478 --> 00:15:44,615
Come take a look.

316
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:46,485
Hey.

317
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,120
Thank you. We're Soorgio Armhany.

318
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,350
- Soo Ah, I can't believe you. - It was designed by me.

319
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,025
- This is just too much. - Soorgio Armhany...

320
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:58,265
- It's so embarrassing. - Ultra-V-Neck Sweater.

321
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,600
- You're getting the hang of it. - Right?

322
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:10,975
I became a lot better after practicing all night.

323
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,515
But I'm not sure if I can throw a ball while dancing.

324
00:16:15,744 --> 00:16:17,810
Is that so? Do you want me to help?

325
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:18,980
I'm free today.

326
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,855
Really? That'd be great.

327
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:24,725
You're an angel.

328
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:28,595
- Let's have fun at the playground. - Okay.

329
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:45,915
Chae Rin, let's go to another playground.

330
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,650
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

331
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,155
Should we start?

332
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:01,925
Will you be all right?

333
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:03,990
You've never played baseball.

334
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:06,035
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

335
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,320
Throw the ball.

336
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,965
Are you sure? Then I'll throw it.

337
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:16,945
Seo Jin!

338
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:20,375
Seo Jin! Are you okay?

339
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,355
I'm okay. Try again.

340
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:27,280
- I'll try again. - Okay.

341
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:28,555
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:36,795
Hold on.

343
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,305
- I'm sorry. - You're doing great.

344
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,145
Do you want to try?

345
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:13,965
Designing clothes is not easy.

346
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,700
How long do we have to wear these?

347
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:23,405
It's so embarrassing.

348
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,600
Don't say that in front of Soo Ah.

349
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:26,970
She's working hard.

350
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,440
Still, this is just not okay.

351
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:31,485
No one would want this rag. Don't you think?

352
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,640
Maybe we should tell her the truth and make her give up...

353
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,625
for her sake.

354
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:38,080
We shouldn't just play along with her.

355
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:40,095
- I'd rather go naked... - Gosh.

356
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,065
Soo Ah.

357
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:45,135
I get it. That's what you thought.

358
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:48,565
- Soo Ah, it's not what you think. - I'm sorry...

359
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:50,565
for forcing you to wear rags.

360
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:54,230
Soo Ah. That's not what I mean.

361
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:56,030
- Soo Ah. - Listen, Soo Ah.

362
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:57,645
- Soo Ah. - Soo Ah.

363
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,385
I'm sorry, Soo Ah.

364
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:05,485
I didn't mean that you weren't talented.

365
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:08,325
Your clothes are so unconventional.

366
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,980
It's hard for me to look good in them.

367
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:12,820
He's right. Your clothes are pretty.

368
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:14,850
They don't look good because our bodies are ugly.

369
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:16,995
Forget it. You're right.

370
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,965
I can't be a designer.

371
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:23,635
- What's that sound? - There must be an order.

372
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,105
That's great.

373
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:28,445
- What? - What's wrong?

374
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:29,705
Look at this.

375
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:32,115
I have orders for the v-neck sweater.

376
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:34,070
- Someone ordered 5. - 5?

377
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:36,745
What? Someone also ordered the hoodie.

378
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:40,785
Some people buy them after all.

379
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,495
Didn't I tell you that unconventional styles were popular?

380
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:47,695
You know nothing about fashion.

381
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:52,220
I'm sorry. I didn't have an eye for it.

382
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,435
Right.

383
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:56,335
We should be honored to wear such amazing clothes.

384
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,975
Really? I have some clothes that I recently designed.

385
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:04,000
- Do you want them? - What?

386
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,145
What?

387
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,940
- Soo Ah. - Yes?

388
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:14,455
What kind of shorts are these?

389
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:19,695
They are a part of Soorgio Armhany's 2018 SS Sexy Collection.

390
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,590
They're called Ultra Fire Shorts.

391
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,020
I shortened the length of the shorts...

392
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,665
to focus on sexiness.

393
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:27,795
- What do you think? - They're nice.

394
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,405
They're sexy and cool.

395
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:31,805
They're embarrassing.

396
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:33,635
Soo Ah.

397
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:36,870
Aren't these too short though?

398
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:39,945
Come on, that's the charm.

399
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:42,970
I'm giving them to you as a special gift.

400
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:46,485
Wear it every day so people can see it, okay?

401
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:48,755
- Okay. - Of course.

402
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:51,695
They look great.

403
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:58,535
You'll do well today, right?

404
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:02,430
Of course. You helped me so much.

405
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,865
I have to do well.

406
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:07,105
If you came and cheered for me,

407
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:08,805
I would do better.

408
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:11,670
I'm sorry, but I have work today.

409
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:13,815
It's okay. Work can't be helped.

410
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:15,585
Instead...

411
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:19,315
- Ta-da. - What's that?

412
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:21,855
- Is it a mustache? - It's a lucky charm.

413
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:23,285
Give me your hand.

414
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:26,550
Even if I'm not with you, take a look at it.

415
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:29,265
Think that I'm always beside you, okay?

416
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:31,025
Thank you.

417
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:32,865
You know that I'm your number one fan, right?

418
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:35,635
Don't forget that I'm always cheering for you.

419
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:36,935
I won't.

420
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:39,905
I have another present.

421
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:41,475
What is it?

422
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:47,175
You can do it, Jun Ki. See you later.

423
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:48,485
I can do it.

424
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:50,210
- Have a good time. - Bye.

425
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:51,455
You can do it.

426
00:21:57,686 --> 00:21:59,995
My goodness.

427
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:01,790
I have to go to the office.

428
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,835
How can I go while looking like this?

429
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:08,835
I should get changed and leave from the window.

430
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,075
Du Shik, may I borrow your laptop?

431
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,975
What are you doing?

432
00:22:16,338 --> 00:22:19,175
Are you taking it off?

433
00:22:20,742 --> 00:22:22,985
No, I was putting it on.

434
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:25,385
I really like your clothes.

435
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,210
Really? Where's Du Shik?

436
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,425
He went out to meet a friend for a while.

437
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,995
Yes, director...

438
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:39,095
I'm on my way.

439
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:41,865
I'll hurry. I'm sorry.

440
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:44,760
Are you going to the office? See you.

441
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:45,905
Thanks.

442
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:50,845
You should go. Make sure many people see it.

443
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:52,045
Okay.

444
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,085
- What is it? - I have something to take out.

445
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,455
See you later.

446
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:01,885
Where is the laptop?

447
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:19,435
What's this?

448
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:26,245
These are the clothes that you asked for.

449
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:27,945
Thank you.

450
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:31,240
What's Soorgio Armhany anyway?

451
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:33,415
Why do you ask me to order clothes for you?

452
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:37,050
I have my reason. I'm sorry for bothering you.

453
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:40,795
Are you wearing boxers? You look embarrassing.

454
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:43,225
Everyone is looking at you.

455
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,820
What? They look cute.

456
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:48,565
Unconventional style is popular these days.

457
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:50,105
Hey.

458
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,030
Do you want to try it on? Try it on.

459
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:55,170
If you like it, recommend it to other people.

460
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,475
Go on and try it.

461
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:59,100
- Are you embarrassed? Try it. - Stop it!

462
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:00,975
- Come on. - Keep it!

463
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,555
You can start over now.

464
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:15,925
You still have time.

465
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:19,365
Find work that will make you happy all your life.

466
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:22,330
- Will I make it if I try? - I'll help you with studying.

467
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,205
- You can do it, Soo Ah. - I can do it.

468
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:28,145
I'll start an online shopping mall.

469
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,575
It's Armhany.

470
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:33,615
- Shopping Mall Soorgio Armhany - Soorgio Armhany

471
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,315
How can I go home first when you're out here?

472
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:05,545
- Soo Ah, what are you doing here? - What?

473
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:08,785
- Nothing. Why? - Why are you annoyed?

474
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:12,685
I borrowed a game from a friend. Want to play and bet on noodles?

475
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,480
No, thanks. I'm tired, so I'll rest.

476
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:16,655
You're a pig.

477
00:25:17,052 --> 00:25:18,525
What? Wait.

478
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:21,825
Pig? Where did that come from?

479
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:23,165
She's crazy.

480
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:27,365
Did you practice a lot?

481
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:29,290
Yes, I did my best.

482
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:31,335
Good job. I guarantee you.

483
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
If it gets aired, you'll become popular.

484
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,405
- Do a good job. - Yes, sir.

485
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:36,945
- Where's the outfit? - Yes, sir.

486
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:38,775
They're here.

487
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:43,385
Wait, why do you have this?

488
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:46,615
It's a great outfit. It's perfect for pole dancing.

489
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:49,025
Where did you buy this?

490
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:52,495
There's a shopping mall that's popular among the stylists.

491
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:54,825
- It's called Soorgio Armhany Mall. - What?

492
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,520
Is Soorgio Armhany Mall popular?

493
00:25:56,525 --> 00:26:00,095
Yes, the owner is now selling clothes of her own brand.

494
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:01,665
The designs are amazing.

495
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:03,435
Isn't it unconventional and sexy?

496
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:05,375
Yes, I guess.

497
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:09,945
Good job on the interview.

498
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:11,845
Since work is finished,

499
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:14,415
shall we go somewhere to eat?

500
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,785
- Sorry? Actually... - Yes?

501
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:21,185
If there isn't more work to do, may I go somewhere?

502
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:24,785
- I have something to do. - Well... All right.

503
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,625
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

504
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:30,295
Goodbye.

505
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:37,565
You gave a shocking pole dancing performance today.

506
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:40,030
The viewer response is already amazing.

507
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:42,370
Where did you get the idea?

508
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,075
The president of my agency came up with the idea.

509
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:48,470
Many other people helped me...

510
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:50,545
so that I could give a better performance.

511
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,725
Seo Jin.

512
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:58,680
- Hello, sir. - What brings you here?

513
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:02,095
I was in the neighborhood, so I stopped by.

514
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:04,860
Pole dancing couldn't have been easy.

515
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,190
Wasn't it difficult?

516
00:27:06,194 --> 00:27:09,905
Of course, it was, but many people helped me.

517
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:13,805
There's someone who helped me practice every day.

518
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,505
As I stand here,

519
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:19,375
I'd like to thank her very much.

520
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:22,645
Is the person your girlfriend?

521
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:23,915
It is, isn't it?

522
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,685
Pardon? Girlfriend?

523
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:37,125
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

524
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:41,365
Really? What's your ideal type?

525
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:42,965
I'm not sure.

526
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:47,475
Please support pole dancing.

527
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:55,715
Jun Ki is still the most searched.

528
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:57,815
"Pole dancing 1st pitch" is the 2nd most searched.

529
00:27:57,913 --> 00:27:59,285
"I took a dump," is the third.

530
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:02,310
You got so popular.

531
00:28:02,317 --> 00:28:04,510
Pole dancing worked, didn't it?

532
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,595
I had no idea that the response would be so positive.

533
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:11,495
Life is full of surprises.

534
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,735
There's one thing that makes me uncomfortable.

535
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:18,335
- What? - You don't have a girlfriend?

536
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:22,345
Do you not want to be alive any longer?

537
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:25,870
It's because the president...

538
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:28,840
told me not to tell anyone that I have a girlfriend.

539
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:31,515
He was so adamant about it, so I couldn't help it.

540
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:34,385
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

541
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,725
I should have told you beforehand.

542
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:38,955
It's okay.

543
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:40,695
It can't be helped.

544
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:42,295
Thank you for understanding.

545
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:46,295
Jun Ki. Why did you wear that outfit?

546
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:47,595
Aren't those the pieces Soo Ah made?

547
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:50,035
Actually, my stylist brought that outfit.

548
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:52,560
Apparently, Soo Ah's online shopping mall is really popular...

549
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,730
among stylists these days.

550
00:28:53,735 --> 00:28:56,045
- What? Really? - I'm telling you.

551
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:58,840
Stylists are praising her and saying that she'll become...

552
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,070
the next Coco Chanel.

553
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,145
- Coco Chanel? Really? - Yes.

554
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,480
Gosh. I saw you do the ceremonial first pitch the other day.

555
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,225
I noticed you received a huge response. It was amazing.

556
00:29:09,384 --> 00:29:10,380
Thank you.

557
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:11,980
I should be the one thanking you.

558
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:14,225
Thanks to you, our drama got promoted.

559
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:16,465
I was meaning to ask you. You saw the script, right?

560
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,850
Yes, of course.

561
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,790
How does it feel to play the opposing role of Cindy...

562
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:22,560
who's receiving unconditional love from middle-aged men?

563
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:23,905
It's an honor, of course.

564
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,705
By the way, who are all those people?

565
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:28,770
They're Cindy's fans.

566
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,875
So they're the middle-aged male fans I've been hearing about.

567
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,015
She really must be popular.

568
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:35,440
- Look. Cindy's here. - It's Cindy. She's coming in.

569
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:37,410
- Cindy. - Cindy.

570
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,455
- Stop them. - Cindy. Cindy.

571
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:42,825
- Cindy. - Cindy. Look over here.

572
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:49,090
(My Love, Cindy, Beautiful Cindy, I love you)

573
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,695
- Cindy. - Cindy.

574
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:56,135
- Cindy. - Cindy.

575
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,905
- Cindy. - I'll love you forever, Cindy.

576
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:02,645
- Cindy. - Cindy.

577
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:04,400
Now, this will be the next scene.

578
00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:07,800
Hae Na, a rookie reporter, meets her first love, Song Jun Seok.

579
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,010
Hae Na notices her first love and runs to Jun Seok...

580
00:30:11,012 --> 00:30:12,680
and throws herself into his arms.

581
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,040
- All right? - Yes.

582
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,255
Let's start shooting right away then.

583
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:19,355
We'll be starting the shoot now.

584
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:24,565
Ready and action.

585
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:27,795
Jun Seok?

586
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:29,305
Jun Seok.

587
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:33,575
What do you think you're doing?

588
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:38,145
Hae Na?

589
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:39,470
It's you, isn't it?

590
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,575
Jun Seok. It's been a long time.

591
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:45,185
Cut. All right. That was great.

592
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,855
- We'll move onto the bus scene. - Yes, sir.

593
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:51,250
I must've gotten lipstick on your clothes. I'm sorry.

594
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:53,080
It could happen.

595
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,295
Don't worry about it.

596
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:01,035
(May your career be filled with glory, Cindy.)

597
00:31:13,141 --> 00:31:15,385
Why are they looking at me like that?

598
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:17,545
They're scaring me.

599
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:22,725
(Baking and Confectionery License Performance Test)

600
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,125
Almighty. Almighty.

601
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:29,020
Please help Yoon Ah pass the test.

602
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:31,365
Bring her luck.

603
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:35,165
I beg you. Please.

604
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:36,305
Gosh. That startled me.

605
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:39,935
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah. I'm over here.

606
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:42,975
Did you finish the test? Did you do well?

607
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:48,200
What's wrong? You didn't do well?

608
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:49,285
No.

609
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:52,115
I think I made a lot of mistakes.

610
00:31:53,214 --> 00:31:55,455
I get the feeling that I'm going to fail.

611
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:57,925
The results haven't even come out.

612
00:31:58,386 --> 00:31:59,955
I'm sure you'll pass.

613
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:03,595
I really worked hard for this.

614
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:08,395
For Sol's sake, I really wanted to pass this test.

615
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:15,605
Why are you crying?

616
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:17,945
Don't worry. You'll pass.

617
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,115
Stop crying. Stop.

618
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:22,545
Dong Gu.

619
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:25,615
Gosh. Come here.

620
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:29,055
You'll be all right.

621
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:35,625
It's all right.

622
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:45,675
(Misfortune Always Comes)

623
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:47,375
Jun Seok.

624
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,045
What do you think you're doing?

625
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:52,200
Gosh. Jun Ki hugged Korea's sweetheart, Cindy.

626
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,540
Who would've thought this could happen?

627
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,885
Don't make a fuss. We were just acting.

628
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:59,140
Anyway, Seo Jin, it must bother you.

629
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:00,255
You must be jealous.

630
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:03,255
Why would I be jealous of that? It's just acting.

631
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,450
She's right.

632
00:33:04,452 --> 00:33:06,555
Bacca's not that narrow-minded.

633
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:08,120
Right.

634
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:09,250
Let's eat at that restaurant...

635
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:11,025
we couldn't go to last time this Sunday.

636
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:13,490
That's all right. I know you're busy these days.

637
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:15,730
No. It's not just any other day. It's your birthday.

638
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,305
How could we possibly not celebrate?

639
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:20,160
I'll make it this time no matter what,

640
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:22,030
so make sure to keep your schedule open, okay?

641
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:23,275
All right. I will.

642
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:24,905
It's your birthday?

643
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:28,915
How can you not know your one and only sister's birthday?

644
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:31,385
That would be expecting too much from you, right?

645
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:37,085
I'm going to do some grocery shopping.

646
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:43,695
Hey. What's wrong with Yoon Ah?

647
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:46,665
I don't think she did too well on the license test.

648
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:49,235
She's been gloomy the past several days.

649
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,760
Then why don't you take her out and cheer her up?

650
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:54,275
I've tried, but nothing works.

651
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,605
Do you know any way I could cheer her up?

652
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,915
In that case, what's most important is...

653
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:01,945
for you to find a way yourself.

654
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,385
- I have a shoot to do. Bye. - Bye.

655
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:05,755
That jerk.

656
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,255
Jun Ki. I'm sorry.

657
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:14,380
I was on my way to pick you up when the car broke down.

658
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,750
It's all right. I can grab a taxi.

659
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:19,465
Don't worry about it. I'll see you at the set.

660
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:23,590
Taxi.

661
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:25,905
My goodness. Gosh.

662
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,460
What was that?

663
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:29,845
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

664
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:31,875
I dropped it by mistake while watering my plants.

665
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:34,775
You should've been more careful.

666
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,685
I could've gotten hurt!

667
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:40,040
I'm truly sorry. Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

668
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:41,355
Never mind. It's all right.

669
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:44,985
That scared me to death.

670
00:34:47,088 --> 00:34:48,225
Taxi.

671
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,265
Welcome, sir.

672
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:53,720
Where would you like me to take you?

673
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:55,465
JBC broadcasting station, please.

674
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,535
I think I've seen you somewhere.

675
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,135
You recognize me.

676
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:02,570
You must've seen my pole dancing during the ceremonial first pitch.

677
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,105
Pole dancing first pitch? What is that?

678
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:06,975
Do you not know?

679
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,440
Then you must watch the drama "Newsroom".

680
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:10,645
"Newsroom"?

681
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,815
That's right. You're Song Jun Seok.

682
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,350
There was a scene where you hugged Cindy.

683
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:19,755
You even remember specific scenes.

684
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:22,265
You're right. That was me.

685
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,760
Would you like my autograph?

686
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,965
No, thank you.

687
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:28,865
I'll be going now then.

688
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:40,075
How could you get carsick from a taxi ride?

689
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:42,485
I don't even want to talk about it.

690
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,685
You wouldn't imagine how fast the driver was driving.

691
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,485
I thought I was going to die.

692
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:47,955
Come to think of it, it's strange.

693
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:50,750
Earlier on, a flower pot fell toward my head.

694
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:52,755
I could've almost died.

695
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,655
Today must be an unlucky day.

696
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:56,065
I guess so.

697
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:58,665
Hold on.

698
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,235
That taxi driver...

699
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,335
looked familiar.

700
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:06,300
There was a scene where you hugged Cindy.

701
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,445
Cindy. Milky-white Cindy.

702
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:12,840
That's right. It was him. He's one of Cindy's middle-aged fans.

703
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,440
What? The taxi driver was one of Cindy's middle-aged fans?

704
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:16,440
Yes.

705
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:18,955
He was one of the fans that came to root for Cindy on set.

706
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:20,915
Wait.

707
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:22,480
My goodness.

708
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:23,650
Are you all right?

709
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:26,125
Cindy!

710
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:31,725
Wait. That guy that dropped the flower pot was also Cindy's fan.

711
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:33,920
That can't be. You must've mistaken them.

712
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:35,435
No. I'm positive.

713
00:36:35,463 --> 00:36:37,735
You don't think they're getting back at me...

714
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,660
for hugging Cindy in that scene, do you?

715
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,300
Gosh. That's nonsense.

716
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:43,145
I don't think the fans would harass you for hugging her.

717
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,775
Right?

718
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:58,050
Why would I? Why would I like Du Shik?

719
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:01,595
He's not good-looking and doesn't even have a good body.

720
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,835
But...

721
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:08,395
he is cute in his own way.

722
00:37:09,497 --> 00:37:11,630
What am I saying? I'm crazy.

723
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,930
I must've lost my mind.

724
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:16,170
Get a hold of yourself. This isn't like you. What's wrong with you?

725
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,245
What are you doing?

726
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:19,115
Why are you looking at a picture of me?

727
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:22,075
I wasn't looking at it at all.

728
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,010
I was just erasing your pictures because you're so ugly.

729
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:25,855
What? You brat.

730
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:27,980
Never mind. Be quiet. Get out.

731
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:29,850
You're so ugly. I don't want to look at you. Get out, you pig.

732
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:31,410
What? Pig?

733
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:34,295
Hey. Why do you keep calling me a pig? Are you crazy?

734
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,265
I don't want to talk to you, so get out, you pig.

735
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,995
All right. I'll leave you, you fool.

736
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:42,635
Go on farting.

737
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:50,375
See? He's ugly and even has a bad temper.

738
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:54,045
But he is kind of tough.

739
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:55,715
He's sexy.

740
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:59,155
Wait. What am I saying? I've gone crazy.

741
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,255
No. This isn't me. This isn't me.

742
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:04,650
He's amazing.

743
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:06,655
(Song Jun Seok of "Newsroom" Pole Dances During the First Pitch.)

744
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:08,855
Good job.

745
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:16,105
(Actor Lee Jun Ki Is Currently Single!)

746
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:23,845
What do you think you're doing? You should be working.

747
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:26,415
It's Lee Jun Ki.

748
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:28,475
This guy is really popular these days.

749
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,245
You were a fan of Lee Jun Ki too?

750
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,815
Yes.

751
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:34,985
- You see, Jun Ki's my... - Yes?

752
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:39,820
No. I mean he's my brother's friend.

753
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,895
Really?

754
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:42,390
That's great.

755
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,425
Then I'll ask you for help if I need an interview.

756
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:47,265
- Sure. - Okay.

757
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,305
Anyway, I'm going on a date soon. What should I wear?

758
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:00,840
Is this the workroom of the rapper who's in charge of our soundtrack?

759
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,970
Yes, he's called MC Dacopy.

760
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:04,815
He's on the rise these days.

761
00:39:05,746 --> 00:39:07,785
His raps are great.

762
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,455
Dacopy.

763
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:12,995
He's here. Hello.

764
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:16,325
What's up?

765
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,165
Long time no see.

766
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:21,190
Who's he?

767
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:24,535
He's Kang Dong Gu, the production assistant.

768
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,905
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

769
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:30,745
- Put your fist up. - All right.

770
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,145
- Nice to meet you. - Let's get it.

771
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,570
How's the music going?

772
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:38,515
It's okay.

773
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:42,010
I heard that it's a spy movie in Dubai.

774
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:44,750
I've prepared some samples that fit the concept.

775
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:46,655
Do you want to hear them?

776
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:48,325
- Shall we? - Okay, let's get it.

777
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,935
Okay, let's get it.

778
00:40:12,446 --> 00:40:14,915
Dubai, Dubai, Dubai, Dubai

779
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:19,795
How do you like it?

780
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:24,525
Isn't this Psy's "Champion"?

781
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:26,535
I think you just changed the lyrics.

782
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:30,365
What the... What did you say?

783
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,000
Are you suggesting that I plagiarized?

784
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,945
No, I just think it's similar.

785
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:38,070
Oh, my gosh.

786
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:41,640
Do you think it sounds like Psy's "Champion", Director?

787
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:44,345
No, it's totally different.

788
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,655
He doesn't know music.

789
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:48,080
Don't mind him.

790
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,350
Then I'll show you the next song.

791
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:51,525
Okay.

792
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,995
I never knew, but I knew

793
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:04,930
Dubai

794
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:06,760
I didn't know well

795
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,675
But don't send me to Dubai

796
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,970
Why's your expression like that?

797
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,145
Well,

798
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:21,155
I think this one sounds a lot like Big Bang's "Lie".

799
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,710
What are you talking about? It's totally different.

800
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,955
- What's wrong with you? - Well,

801
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,495
I thought that the rhythms were similar.

802
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:32,250
You're pickier than I thought. All right.

803
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:35,120
I'll give you something you've never heard of.

804
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:38,705
I wanted to change my style from traditional rapping.

805
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,875
I'll let you listen to it.

806
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:02,895
What? Have you heard of this too?

807
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,035
Well, no. No.

808
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:10,135
It's nice and new.

809
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:13,275
Yes, it's good.

810
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,635
We'll use this one.

811
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:18,745
- Okay, let's get it. - All right.

812
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:21,800
I'll work on it a bit more, and we'll discuss it more later.

813
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,015
Okay.

814
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:27,085
I went to Dubai

815
00:42:27,815 --> 00:42:28,985
I already memorized it.

816
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:35,295
In this scene, Hae Na suddenly visits Jun Seok's house.

817
00:42:35,623 --> 00:42:38,120
You need to look at him for a few seconds...

818
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,995
with watery eyes and then kiss him suddenly.

819
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:43,035
- Do you understand? - Yes.

820
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,390
We'll start shooting then.

821
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:46,275
- Let's make it as real as possible. - Okay.

822
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,275
We're shooting.

823
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:51,970
Get ready. Action!

824
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:53,145
Who is it?

825
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:57,345
Hae Na, what brings you here?

826
00:42:57,645 --> 00:42:58,815
Jun Seok.

827
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,415
Come inside. We can talk inside.

828
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,160
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

829
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,290
Are you all right?

830
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,860
What are you doing?

831
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:17,105
I'm sorry, sir.

832
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:19,935
- Are you all right, Jun Ki? - I'm okay.

833
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,400
Cindy?

834
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:30,345
What's that? Cindy? Is he...

835
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:32,840
We'll start the kissing scene again.

836
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,515
All right.

837
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:38,025
Get ready. Action!

838
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:43,795
- Are you all right? - Gosh!

839
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:45,750
Cut. What's wrong?

840
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:49,365
- Jun Ki. Jun Ki, are you all right? - Yes.

841
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:51,430
Are you out of your minds?

842
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:53,335
What's wrong with everyone today?

843
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,135
Gosh, what's wrong so suddenly?

844
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm sorry, Jun Ki.

845
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:58,975
It's okay.

846
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:05,515
Cindy?

847
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:07,655
Is he also...

848
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,185
Are you all right?

849
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,420
Yes, I'm fine.

850
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,165
We'll take a break until we have the light set up again.

851
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,095
- Take a break, Jun Ki. - Yes.

852
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:26,205
Something's not right. Something's going wrong.

853
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,135
Jun Ki, are you all right?

854
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:29,570
Something's wrong.

855
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:33,040
I think all the staff members are Cindy's fans.

856
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,540
Gosh, are you talking about that again?

857
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:37,040
It's not like that. I'm sure there's something.

858
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:39,185
Calm down and drink this.

859
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:41,715
Thanks.

860
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:50,495
What's wrong with this?

861
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:56,235
Hey, the expiry date was a year ago.

862
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:59,205
Really? I'm sorry.

863
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,000
I just bought it from the shop.

864
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:02,705
Gosh, it's fine.

865
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:06,100
Hey, I don't have anything to do on Sunday, right?

866
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:08,175
I have an important appointment.

867
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:09,340
- Sunday? - Yes.

868
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:10,515
Just wait a moment.

869
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:12,485
Sunday.

870
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,080
(My Love Cindy)

871
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:19,925
Cindy? My manager is... He's also...

872
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:23,425
- What's wrong? - It's nothing.

873
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:26,560
Are you all right? Do you want some coffee to wake you up?

874
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,665
No! I'll never drink that!

875
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:30,035
Why are you getting angry?

876
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,805
Jun Ki!

877
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:48,085
This is it.

878
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:50,585
Park Seo Jun is my style,

879
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:53,095
not Du Shik.

880
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:54,525
How can he be?

881
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:58,625
He's so handsome.

882
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:13,315
What's wrong?

883
00:46:13,707 --> 00:46:15,815
You're out of your mind. Gosh.

884
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,945
Min Soo Ah, you must be crazy.

885
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:20,585
- What are you doing? - Gosh.

886
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:24,885
Why do you care what I do, you pig?

887
00:46:25,753 --> 00:46:27,620
You're calling me pig again. Hey!

888
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:28,950
Why am I a pig?

889
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,325
You stupid, dumb sea animal!

890
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,525
She must be a psychopath. She's crazy.

891
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:34,435
Gosh, Jun Ki.

892
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:36,790
Why are you so pale?

893
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:39,205
Du Shik, I'm so scared.

894
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:42,535
She must be a psychopath. She's crazy.

895
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:43,905
Gosh, Jun Ki.

896
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,270
Why are you so pale?

897
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:48,670
Du Shik, I'm so scared.

898
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:50,315
What are you afraid of?

899
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:54,915
What? You think Cindy's fans are terrorizing you?

900
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:57,680
Yes. Every time something weird happens,

901
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:59,080
it involves her fans.

902
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:01,550
I think they're revenging on me...

903
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:03,550
now that we are in love.

904
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:04,895
Does that make sense?

905
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:06,360
You're paranoid.

906
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,705
It's not that! I'm certain something's going on!

907
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:11,735
You should just go to bed and get some sleep.

908
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:13,975
- You're just tired. - Really?

909
00:47:14,802 --> 00:47:16,075
Maybe that's it.

910
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:18,845
- It's get better when I rest. - You should go and rest.

911
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:21,445
All right.

912
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,910
Gosh, it's so dangerous. It's dangerous outside this room.

913
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:27,185
It's dangerous.

914
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,020
(I'll kill you, Jun Ki. Cindy is mine. Get away from her.)

915
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,565
Jun Ki, what's wrong?

916
00:47:38,826 --> 00:47:41,990
Look at this. Cindy's fans are blackmailing me.

917
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:44,135
Someone must have been in here.

918
00:47:45,265 --> 00:47:47,775
I can't be safe even in my own bed.

919
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:51,645
Jun Ki, where are you going?

920
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,145
What's with him?

921
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:01,085
(Stay away from Cindy, or you'll be dead meat.)

922
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:14,095
(My Love, Cindy)

923
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,205
What are you doing?

924
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,945
I bought some sundae for you.

925
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:26,745
Thank you.

926
00:48:32,346 --> 00:48:34,855
Are you still depressed about the exam?

927
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:36,755
No.

928
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:39,210
You have a lot of work these days, right?

929
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:42,450
Yes. I'm leaving for Dubai in a week.

930
00:48:42,456 --> 00:48:43,965
I have a lot to prepare.

931
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:45,950
You'll be away for a month, right?

932
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:47,035
Yes.

933
00:48:48,028 --> 00:48:51,465
I'll miss you and Sol so much.

934
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:52,630
Should I just not go?

935
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:54,905
Don't be silly.

936
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:57,330
I hope you'll have a safe trip.

937
00:48:57,337 --> 00:48:58,475
I mean,

938
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:01,545
I'm worried I'll fall for another girl.

939
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:09,080
I'm just joking to make you laugh.

940
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:10,185
I'm sorry.

941
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:14,495
I met someone really funny today. Do you want to hear?

942
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:16,420
Who did you meet?

943
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:19,560
I met the rapper who is working on our sound track.

944
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,035
But all his songs sounded so familiar.

945
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:26,360
He copied Psy, Big Bang, and iKon's songs.

946
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:29,075
All he did was change lyrics.

947
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:30,645
Really?

948
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:32,575
What was his name?

949
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,815
MC Dacopy?

950
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:36,970
Oh, is he called Dacopy...

951
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:38,785
because he copies songs?

952
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:40,810
MC Dacopy?

953
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:42,580
What? You've heard of him?

954
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:45,750
Of course. He's my favorite rapper.

955
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:49,765
He's the one who inspired me to dream of becoming a rapper.

956
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:51,565
Really?

957
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:54,135
It's my dream to meet him.

958
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:56,405
Do you want me to introduce you to him?

959
00:49:56,697 --> 00:50:00,105
Really? That'd be so fantastic.

960
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,775
My goodness. You're finally smiling.

961
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,070
Are you that happy?

962
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:05,745
Yes, I'm so happy.

963
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:09,070
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

964
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:10,215
My goodness.

965
00:50:12,946 --> 00:50:14,115
I can't believe it.

966
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:17,710
- Hi. - Hi.

967
00:50:17,718 --> 00:50:19,355
Hi.

968
00:50:20,087 --> 00:50:21,625
Jun Ki, you're here.

969
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:24,895
You must be tired. Do you want some coffee?

970
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:26,865
Sure. Thanks.

971
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:45,985
I don't want to drink it. No!

972
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,965
Why are you eating alone?

973
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:00,195
Let me join you.

974
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:03,465
I'm okay.

975
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:05,805
You have rice on your face.

976
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:27,295
Give it to me.

977
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:29,595
I'm saving it for when I'm drunk later.

978
00:51:30,023 --> 00:51:31,195
Don't touch it!

979
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:47,845
Gosh.

980
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:49,785
Cindy...

981
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,310
You startled me.

982
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:55,515
Are you angry with me for something?

983
00:51:57,217 --> 00:51:58,455
No.

984
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:00,395
Then why are you avoiding me?

985
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,395
You don't talk to me, and you ignore me when I say hi.

986
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:06,760
Did I do something wrong?

987
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,720
No, that's not it.

988
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:10,965
Tell me if I did something wrong.

989
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:14,135
I'll try to change. Please.

990
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,445
Are you crying?

991
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,085
The thing is...

992
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,740
What's wrong?

993
00:52:27,748 --> 00:52:29,615
I think something went in my eye.

994
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:32,985
Really? Let me see.

995
00:52:45,632 --> 00:52:49,035
Done. I've updated all our new products.

996
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,400
I'm so tired.

997
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:52,400
What is Soo Ah doing? Why are you doing all the work?

998
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:55,100
I don't know. She's so mean.

999
00:52:55,108 --> 00:52:57,785
She never does any work, and she calls me a pig.

1000
00:52:57,844 --> 00:52:59,145
She's weird.

1001
00:52:59,546 --> 00:53:01,280
She's never been normal.

1002
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:02,485
That's right.

1003
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,910
Now that I'm finished,

1004
00:53:04,918 --> 00:53:07,450
I'll play with the number of viewers...

1005
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,495
for "President Is Bruce Lee" a bit.

1006
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:15,035
Hold on. "Lee Jun Ki" is the most searched word right now.

1007
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:18,035
Do you think it's the Lee Jun Ki we know?

1008
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:22,800
What's that?

1009
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:24,530
"Cindy and Lee Jun Ki are dating."

1010
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:25,875
"A secret date"?

1011
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,400
What? What are you talking about?

1012
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,515
Well...

1013
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:33,410
(Cindy And Lee Jun Ki's Secret Date)

1014
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:34,755
What's that?

1015
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:38,425
I don't know. What's going on?

1016
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,695
I'm back.

1017
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,595
What are you guys doing?

1018
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:46,490
Did you find something interesting? I want to see it too.

1019
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:48,595
I want to see it.

1020
00:53:51,131 --> 00:53:53,200
Wait. What is this?

1021
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,105
What's going on?

1022
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:56,945
Did you kiss Cindy?

1023
00:53:57,904 --> 00:54:00,175
No. What are you talking about?

1024
00:54:00,273 --> 00:54:02,140
It's not true.

1025
00:54:02,142 --> 00:54:03,710
It's just a misunderstanding.

1026
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,140
What's this picture then?

1027
00:54:05,145 --> 00:54:07,940
Well... She had something in her eye,

1028
00:54:07,948 --> 00:54:09,925
so I was blowing it out.

1029
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:11,555
It's true.

1030
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:13,925
Seo Jin, you trust me, don't you?

1031
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:16,255
Is that right?

1032
00:54:17,524 --> 00:54:19,025
I knew it.

1033
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:20,935
Gosh.

1034
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,960
Who wrote this article?

1035
00:54:22,963 --> 00:54:24,830
Seo Jin, don't worry.

1036
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:27,630
I'll make sure a correction is published right away.

1037
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:28,705
Okay.

1038
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:39,955
(CEO)

1039
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:48,525
Hello. Have you seen the article?

1040
00:54:49,055 --> 00:54:50,965
It's a misunderstanding.

1041
00:54:51,057 --> 00:54:52,895
Nothing is going on between Cindy and me.

1042
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,165
We should publish a correction right away.

1043
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:56,365
"A correction"?

1044
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,730
Why? Just leave it.

1045
00:54:58,732 --> 00:55:01,200
What? What are you...

1046
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:03,530
Jun Ki. Who is Cindy?

1047
00:55:03,537 --> 00:55:06,005
She's the nation's little sister.

1048
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,740
A scandal with Cindy will make you famous...

1049
00:55:08,742 --> 00:55:12,210
and bring you a ton of media coverage.

1050
00:55:12,212 --> 00:55:14,185
Still...

1051
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:17,285
Stay quiet for the time being.

1052
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:19,950
I'll make a comment at an appropriate time. Okay?

1053
00:55:19,953 --> 00:55:21,125
Well...

1054
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:22,955
Sir?

1055
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:26,835
It's driving me crazy.

1056
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,805
Well...

1057
00:55:31,865 --> 00:55:32,930
(Lee Jun Ki and Cindy dating)

1058
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:34,605
He's still on top.

1059
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:36,745
More articles are coming out every second.

1060
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:41,145
What did he say? Will they publish a correction?

1061
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:42,845
Well...

1062
00:55:43,043 --> 00:55:45,915
The CEO wants to wait.

1063
00:55:45,979 --> 00:55:47,710
- What? - Well...

1064
00:55:47,714 --> 00:55:51,485
He thinks the rumor will make me famous.

1065
00:55:51,985 --> 00:55:54,255
He wants me to stay quiet.

1066
00:55:55,555 --> 00:55:57,065
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1067
00:55:58,391 --> 00:55:59,495
Is that so?

1068
00:56:00,093 --> 00:56:02,035
What can you do?

1069
00:56:02,662 --> 00:56:05,360
I'm okay. Don't worry.

1070
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:07,775
Jun Ki, this is not okay.

1071
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:10,305
How would Seo Jin feel?

1072
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:12,770
She can't tell people you're his boyfriend,

1073
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:14,500
and she even has to put up with your dating rumors.

1074
00:56:14,507 --> 00:56:15,775
Isn't that too much?

1075
00:56:15,909 --> 00:56:18,545
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

1076
00:56:19,145 --> 00:56:20,380
I really am.

1077
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,480
Don't worry.

1078
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:23,485
It's not your fault.

1079
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,510
By the way, when you hugged Cindy in the drama,

1080
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:27,980
her fans went crazy.

1081
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:30,620
With the rumors spreading, won't they try to...

1082
00:56:30,624 --> 00:56:32,025
kill you?

1083
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:34,735
Right. I'm in trouble.

1084
00:56:35,128 --> 00:56:36,930
And we're celebrating Seo Jin's birthday tomorrow.

1085
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,130
We can celebrate at home.

1086
00:56:39,132 --> 00:56:41,735
I've already booked a place.

1087
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:45,105
And we can't just stay home on your birthday.

1088
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:47,470
I'll figure it out.

1089
00:56:47,474 --> 00:56:50,215
We are going on a date tomorrow, okay?

1090
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,145
Okay.

1091
00:56:55,382 --> 00:56:57,725
Unbelievable.

1092
00:56:59,886 --> 00:57:01,025
Let's get it.

1093
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:04,395
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1094
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:06,990
Thank you for making time.

1095
00:57:06,993 --> 00:57:08,465
You're welcome.

1096
00:57:08,962 --> 00:57:11,990
I had no idea your girlfriend...

1097
00:57:11,998 --> 00:57:13,805
was my fan.

1098
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:15,635
Neither did I.

1099
00:57:16,336 --> 00:57:19,570
Your music inspired me to dream of...

1100
00:57:19,572 --> 00:57:21,445
becoming a rapper.

1101
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,315
But I've given up.

1102
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,570
Really?

1103
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:26,485
You dreamed of becoming a rapper?

1104
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:29,055
Let's get it.

1105
00:57:34,354 --> 00:57:37,050
Now that you're here,

1106
00:57:37,057 --> 00:57:38,965
why don't you try recording something?

1107
00:57:39,859 --> 00:57:42,195
- Really? - Of course.

1108
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:43,505
Give it a try.

1109
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,835
It'll be a good time. It would be memorable.

1110
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:47,305
Which song would you like to sing?

1111
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:50,370
Your main song...

1112
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,615
"Mapo Bridge" is my favorite. May I sing it once?

1113
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,875
Sure, why not?

1114
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:56,300
Go to the recording room. Let's get it.

1115
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:57,415
Okay.

1116
00:58:02,182 --> 00:58:04,910
Yoon Ah, let's get started.

1117
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:06,625
- Don't be nervous. - Okay.

1118
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,195
Okay, let's get it.

1119
00:58:14,694 --> 00:58:17,965
It's the same as "Yanghwa Bridge" by Zion.T.

1120
00:58:18,098 --> 00:58:21,405
I can't believe this. Unbelievable.

1121
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,210
I was always alone at my home

1122
00:58:33,213 --> 00:58:35,955
Mother was a bus driver

1123
00:58:36,015 --> 00:58:38,280
When I asked her where she was

1124
00:58:38,284 --> 00:58:40,225
It was always Mapo Bridge

1125
00:58:40,787 --> 00:58:43,325
Let's be happy

1126
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,865
Let's be happy

1127
00:58:46,326 --> 00:58:48,195
Don't be sad

1128
00:58:48,995 --> 00:58:50,805
Don't be sad

1129
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:53,065
Wait, Yoon Ah.

1130
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,600
Yes, what is it?

1131
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:56,635
Your singing reminds me...

1132
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,705
of Zion.T.

1133
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:02,145
You seem confused with "Yanghwa Bridge" by Zion.T.

1134
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:04,870
This is my song, "Mapo Bridge".

1135
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:06,980
It's not "Yanghwa Bridge". You know what I'm saying?

1136
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,915
Yes, I'm sorry.

1137
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:12,585
Don't ever sing like Zion.T, okay?

1138
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,825
- Okay. - Let's start again.

1139
00:59:14,954 --> 00:59:16,125
Let's get it.

1140
00:59:27,534 --> 00:59:30,430
I was always alone at my home

1141
00:59:30,436 --> 00:59:33,130
Mother was a bus driver

1142
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:35,500
When I asked her where she was

1143
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:37,345
It was always Mapo Bridge

1144
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:40,340
Let's be happy

1145
00:59:40,346 --> 00:59:41,515
Stop it, stop it.

1146
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:45,225
You sound like Zion.T again.

1147
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:48,420
This song is completely different.

1148
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:49,855
Why do you keep getting confused?

1149
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:52,120
Yanghwa Bridge and Mapo Bridge...

1150
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:54,665
are at least over 1km apart.

1151
00:59:55,094 --> 00:59:58,635
There's Seogang Bridge in between. How are you confused? I mean...

1152
01:00:01,234 --> 01:00:03,175
Be happy... No.

1153
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,545
Let's be happy

1154
01:00:06,906 --> 01:00:08,975
Let's be happy

1155
01:00:09,175 --> 01:00:11,285
Is this so hard?

1156
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:12,845
I'm sorry.

1157
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:17,550
Let's do it one last time.

1158
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:18,725
Okay.

1159
01:00:26,726 --> 01:00:28,235
Gosh, Bacca.

1160
01:00:29,028 --> 01:00:32,265
- You look so pretty today. - Really?

1161
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:35,005
We haven't gone on a date in a while, so I dressed up.

1162
01:00:35,134 --> 01:00:37,505
- Do I look okay? - Yes, you look beautiful.

1163
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:40,645
- Shall we go? - Okay.

1164
01:00:40,907 --> 01:00:42,815
I almost forgot. Wait.

1165
01:00:45,912 --> 01:00:48,840
- What are you doing? - In case reporters catch me,

1166
01:00:48,848 --> 01:00:51,625
the president told me to go outside like this.

1167
01:00:52,785 --> 01:00:53,880
Really?

1168
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,955
Okay, let's go.

1169
01:00:56,556 --> 01:00:57,725
Let's go.

1170
01:01:02,328 --> 01:01:03,595
Welcome.

1171
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:07,305
Do you have reservations?

1172
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:10,775
- Chewbacca. - Please go that way.

1173
01:01:18,278 --> 01:01:19,385
Wait just a moment.

1174
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:21,115
Here.

1175
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:24,485
The chair is going in.

1176
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:33,495
Thank you.

1177
01:01:33,526 --> 01:01:36,360
Anyway, will you keep those on?

1178
01:01:36,362 --> 01:01:37,535
What do you mean?

1179
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:40,835
Oh, I should take these off.

1180
01:01:43,002 --> 01:01:44,900
You should order, Seo Jin.

1181
01:01:44,904 --> 01:01:47,600
I'll buy you everything that you want today.

1182
01:01:47,607 --> 01:01:49,815
Really? I'm so excited.

1183
01:01:50,343 --> 01:01:51,745
What shall I eat?

1184
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:54,785
Yes, I just arrived.

1185
01:01:54,948 --> 01:01:57,755
The interview just ended. Yes.

1186
01:01:58,284 --> 01:01:59,625
Which room was it?

1187
01:01:59,852 --> 01:02:01,495
On the right? Okay.

1188
01:02:03,256 --> 01:02:05,965
Gosh, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

1189
01:02:06,392 --> 01:02:07,565
It's okay.

1190
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:15,235
What shall we eat? How about this?

1191
01:02:20,273 --> 01:02:21,445
Let's see.

1192
01:02:22,008 --> 01:02:23,885
Sirloin? Tenderloin?

1193
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,145
Seo Jin, decide what you want.

1194
01:02:26,179 --> 01:02:28,415
- I'm going to the restroom. - Okay, go ahead.

1195
01:02:29,382 --> 01:02:30,525
Sirloin?

1196
01:02:43,896 --> 01:02:45,065
Pardon me.

1197
01:02:46,132 --> 01:02:47,675
You're Lee Jun Ki, right?

1198
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:50,130
No, you're mistaken.

1199
01:02:50,136 --> 01:02:51,970
Come on, you are Lee Jun Ki.

1200
01:02:51,971 --> 01:02:54,045
I saw you sitting in the room.

1201
01:02:54,307 --> 01:02:57,845
Mr. Lee, could you say something about your romantic life?

1202
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:58,970
Do you admit it?

1203
01:02:58,978 --> 01:03:00,540
- I'm not Lee Jun Ki. - Come on.

1204
01:03:00,546 --> 01:03:04,080
Then why don't you lower your mask a bit?

1205
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:05,980
I'll let you go if you aren't him. Show me a little.

1206
01:03:05,985 --> 01:03:07,820
- Lower it a little. - Goodness.

1207
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,220
- Wait, Mr. Lee Jun Ki. - Gosh.

1208
01:03:10,223 --> 01:03:12,765
Wait, Mr. Lee Jun Ki!

1209
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,165
Why isn't he back yet?

1210
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:23,175
(Jun Ki)

1211
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:25,945
It's him. What's going on?

1212
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,175
Jun Ki, why aren't you back yet?

1213
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:32,985
Seo Jin, a reporter is chasing me.

1214
01:03:33,413 --> 01:03:36,515
I can't go back to the restaurant. What should I do?

1215
01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:38,025
What?

1216
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:39,225
I'm really sorry.

1217
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:43,595
Gosh, she's still chasing me.

1218
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:46,265
See you later at home. I'm sorry.

1219
01:04:22,428 --> 01:04:23,835
Seo Jin, you're home.

1220
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,565
I'm sorry about what happened.

1221
01:04:26,933 --> 01:04:29,075
A reporter was waiting for me in the hallway.

1222
01:04:29,602 --> 01:04:33,645
She asked me if the rumor was true. I couldn't help but run away.

1223
01:04:34,941 --> 01:04:36,775
I'm really sorry.

1224
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:43,155
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

1225
01:04:46,953 --> 01:04:48,855
I have something to say.

1226
01:04:48,921 --> 01:04:51,265
You do? What is it?

1227
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:54,635
Let's take some time to think.

1228
01:04:56,262 --> 01:04:57,465
What?

1229
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:01,135
"Take some time to think"?

1230
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:04,045
What do you mean by that?

1231
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:06,145
I mean...

1232
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:10,115
we should reconsider our relationship.

1233
01:05:11,878 --> 01:05:13,045
What?

1234
01:05:15,581 --> 01:05:17,825
What's wrong with him?

1235
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:20,655
"Yanghwa Bridge" and "Mapo Bridge" sound the same.

1236
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,365
He's the one who copied the song. Why did he take it out on you?

1237
01:05:26,192 --> 01:05:28,220
Yoon Ah, cheer up.

1238
01:05:28,227 --> 01:05:29,835
He was the one who was acting strange.

1239
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:32,305
It's okay.

1240
01:05:33,032 --> 01:05:35,475
I gave up on being a rapper anyway.

1241
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:39,945
Dong Gu.

1242
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:44,545
Why can't I do anything well?

1243
01:05:45,178 --> 01:05:48,255
I can neither bake nor rap.

1244
01:05:48,648 --> 01:05:49,755
Come on.

1245
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:53,185
Don't think so negatively.

1246
01:05:53,319 --> 01:05:54,495
I'm sorry.

1247
01:05:55,321 --> 01:05:58,365
I know that you're trying to cheer me up,

1248
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:00,695
but I can't cheer up.

1249
01:06:03,629 --> 01:06:05,805
You can't do this anymore.

1250
01:06:06,232 --> 01:06:09,735
Yoon Ah, I prepared something for you.

1251
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:11,745
What is it?

1252
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,675
Yes, get it

1253
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:20,855
The first wound stays in the heart, the tears fall

1254
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,380
Even if you're lonely or sad

1255
01:06:22,381 --> 01:06:23,740
Don't cry

1256
01:06:23,749 --> 01:06:25,125
My dear Yoon Ah

1257
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:28,320
What are you doing, Dong Gu?

1258
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:30,480
Look at my eyes

1259
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:31,650
Forget about MC Dacopy

1260
01:06:31,657 --> 01:06:34,420
Erase everything, and run

1261
01:06:34,427 --> 01:06:36,320
Run toward your dream, just go

1262
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:37,505
Where?

1263
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,260
Let me start over. Again.

1264
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:42,675
Just Go

1265
01:06:45,638 --> 01:06:47,540
You're laughing, right?

1266
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,015
Then you're feeling better, right?

1267
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:54,455
It sure is hard to cheer you up.

1268
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,080
Gosh. That was embarrassing.

1269
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:58,285
Why? You're a good rapper.

1270
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:01,195
I could never be as good as you.

1271
01:07:01,287 --> 01:07:04,225
Gosh, Sol. What do you think about my rap skills?

1272
01:07:08,027 --> 01:07:10,905
(Ms. Han Yoon Ah, Congratulations. You've passed the test.)

1273
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:13,005
Why? What is it?

1274
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:14,735
I passed the test.

1275
01:07:15,301 --> 01:07:17,970
I passed the baking license test.

1276
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,145
Really?

1277
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,410
You see? What did I tell you? I told you you'd pass the test.

1278
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,685
Congratulations, Yoon Ah.

1279
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:27,010
Thank you.

1280
01:07:27,013 --> 01:07:28,555
Wait a minute.

1281
01:07:28,748 --> 01:07:30,440
We should celebrate on a day like this.

1282
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:31,625
Let's have a party.

1283
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:34,355
Wait here for a minute. I'll go buy a cake, all right?

1284
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,655
Dong Gu.

1285
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:42,995
Yoon Ah.

1286
01:08:06,118 --> 01:08:09,520
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1287
01:08:09,522 --> 01:08:11,650
What? Sol's father's here?

1288
01:08:11,657 --> 01:08:13,065
Why are you here?

1289
01:08:13,259 --> 01:08:14,360
Daddy.

1290
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,920
Blood really must be thicker than water.

1291
01:08:15,928 --> 01:08:18,630
I'd like to take care of Yoon Ah and Sol.

1292
01:08:18,631 --> 01:08:20,130
After all this time, you want to take care of them now?

1293
01:08:20,132 --> 01:08:21,760
I still love Yoon Ah.

1294
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:23,900
This won't change anything.

1295
01:08:23,903 --> 01:08:25,770
But it won't change the fact that I'm Sol's father.

1296
01:08:25,771 --> 01:08:28,000
I want to ask you for your forgiveness. Is that wrong?

1297
01:08:28,007 --> 01:08:30,440
Why do I keep thinking of Du Shik? Why?

1298
01:08:30,443 --> 01:08:31,870
You're crazy, Soo Ah.

1299
01:08:31,877 --> 01:08:33,785
You've completely lost your mind.

1300
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,580
- My stomach. - What's wrong? Are you sick?

1301
01:08:36,582 --> 01:08:38,050
Is there a Bong Du Shik here?

1302
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:40,895
I have something to say to you.

1303
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,255
I think I...

1304
01:08:43,389 --> 01:08:46,365
I thought I was a strong person, but I guess I'm not.

1305
01:08:46,592 --> 01:08:50,260
You mean you're going to let go of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

1306
01:08:50,262 --> 01:08:51,290
You should move out of there first.

1307
01:08:51,297 --> 01:08:54,300
- So? - I'm breaking up with Seo Jin.

1308
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,360
I'd like to tell you all the truth...

1309
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:59,205
about the romance rumor between Cindy and myself.
