1
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:16,060
We are the world

2
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,850
Firstly, I would love to say thank you to everyone...

3
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:22,190
for staying at Waikiki Guesthouse.

4
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:24,790
I really hope you have a great trip...

5
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:26,800
with Waikiki Guesthouse.

6
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:28,170
It's your turn.

7
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:30,230
- Ladies and gentlemen! - Everyone,

8
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,670
Thank you.

9
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,170
Okay.

10
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:35,400
Is that all?

11
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,530
My speech was a lot longer than that.

12
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,640
Mine is just condensed.

13
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:38,970
They just need to get the point.

14
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:40,310
Forget it.

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,510
What would I expect from you?

16
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:44,640
Alright, let's have some fun today!

17
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:46,110
Cheers!

18
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:47,760
- Cheers! - Cheers!

19
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,190
What's wrong with him?

20
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:57,690
He got dumped recently.

21
00:00:57,694 --> 00:00:59,920
(Finally, I can be honest about how I feel.)

22
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,200
(I was always thinking ahead.)

23
00:01:01,498 --> 00:01:04,300
You don't have to worry about him. Here we go...

24
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,830
Cheers!

25
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:07,210
- Cheers! - Cheers!

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,600
What's wrong with her?

27
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:14,010
She also got dumped a few days ago.

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,920
It was really brutal. It couldn't get worse than that.

29
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:20,210
Don't worry about them. Here we go again!

30
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:22,080
- Cheers! - Cheers!

31
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,420
Well, I don't feel like it anymore. I'll go back to my room and rest.

32
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:25,950
Why? I thought we are having fun.

33
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:28,050
Where are you going? Wait!

34
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:29,290
- Excuse me? - Wait!

35
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,620
- Stop it! - Don't go!

36
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:32,620
Mayday! Mayday!

37
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:35,690
- Please wait! - This is emergency!

38
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:37,040
Goodness!

39
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:41,000
You guys!

40
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,000
Stop blowing your nose,

41
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,080
or your brains will come out.

42
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:47,110
For how long will you be like this?

43
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,040
Don't you see our guests feeling uncomfortable because of you two?

44
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,550
I just can't get over Tae Hyun.

46
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,750
I can't stop crying.

47
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:57,180
- What are you talking about? - What are you talking about?

48
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:59,630
Don't cry, Seo Jin.

49
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,600
Seo Jin!

50
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,540
- Oh, my goodness. - Are you Jean Valjean or what?

51
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:21,310
Tae Hyun, what are you doing here?

52
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:22,650
I wanted to see you.

53
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,940
I wanted to see you so much.

54
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:26,850
Weren't you disappointed in me?

55
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,520
Why would I be disappointed in you?

56
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:30,430
Is it because of your facial hair?

57
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:33,430
That's so stupid! What's so wrong with it?

58
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:36,390
Are you a fool?

59
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:39,370
Even if you grow bananas from the top of your head...

60
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,170
Even if you grow...

61
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:43,700
kelp and seaweed from your armpits...

62
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,760
He's insane.

63
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:46,560
I don't care, Seo Jin.

64
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,880
Tae Hyun.

65
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:51,250
Do you want to officially become my girlfriend?

66
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:53,880
Tae Hyun!

67
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:56,850
Kelp or seaweed...

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,750
It doesn't matter.

69
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:03,420
Do they think they are in a movie or something?

70
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,750
It's like such an ugly and awful...

71
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,590
third-rate cult film.

72
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,360
Don't you agree, Dong Gu?

73
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:12,430
I'm so jealous.

74
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:13,970
Alright...

75
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,710
("A Beautiful Farewell")

76
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:24,810
- Let's go. - Let's do this!

77
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,670
- That's it! - Yes!

78
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:28,950
- We did it! - Yes!

79
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:47,000
- Tae Hyun, here's your coffee. - Thank you.

80
00:03:47,063 --> 00:03:49,740
Tae Hyun, you are bleeding.

81
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:54,510
It's okay. I get nosebleeds often.

82
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,090
They are such nice paintings.

83
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:14,720
We are already here. It's pretty late. You should go in now.

84
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

85
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:28,440
Oh, I almost forgot about this.

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,170
- Here you are. - What is this?

87
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,020
You have to open this in your room.

88
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:36,950
I'll go now.

89
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:40,290
- Take care! - I will.

90
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:00,510
I love you.

91
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:03,610
I'm home.

92
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,240
You are home! How was the date?

93
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:09,650
Chewbacca, why are you blushing so much right now?

94
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,380
It's like you just had a kiss or something.

95
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,440
It's not like that.

96
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:14,380
What do you mean? It's so obvious!

97
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:16,250
- What is that? - This?

98
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:17,650
It's a gift from Tae Hyun.

99
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:18,680
Gift?

100
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:19,850
Let's open it!

101
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:21,820
Why do you want to do that? It's mine!

102
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,260
Because I'm your older brother!

103
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,100
Why can't I see it?

104
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:28,600
It's quite nice.

105
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,610
What? What is this?

106
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:37,950
It's a razor!

107
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:41,650
Well, that's...

108
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:44,210
That's something I've never seen before.

109
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,380
I've never seen a woman...

110
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,420
who gets a razor from her boyfriend.

111
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:51,630
- Stop talking. - Don't you agree, Dong Gu?

112
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:54,150
What's your problem now?

113
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,900
Come to think of it,

114
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,900
I don't think I ever gave Soo Ah a proper gift.

115
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:10,750
What is this smell?

116
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,710
It's gimbap!

117
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:15,110
What do you think you are doing? It's for Tae Hyun!

118
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,140
That's so annoying! I'm not going to have it!

119
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:18,590
Don't eat it.

120
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,910
You've never cooked a bag of ramyeon for us before.

121
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,560
But look what you are doing to your boyfriend now.

122
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:26,960
How stingy.

123
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:28,830
Don't you agree, Dong Gu?

124
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:31,690
What now?

125
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:35,760
I never made gimbap for Soo Ah.

126
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:38,300
There are not many guys who make...

127
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,660
gimbap for their girlfriends in Korea.

128
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,580
Don't you agree, Du Shik?

129
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:45,370
Don't you need to ask me...

130
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,650
if I ever had a girlfriend first?

131
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:50,750
- I'm sorry. - You are so mean!

132
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:24,550
Seo Jin, why are you just standing there?

133
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:27,910
There's no reason. You have a nosebleed.

134
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:30,620
I'm just stressed out a lot because of my work.

135
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,280
So it's happening more often these days.

136
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:33,590
I see.

137
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,830
I'm almost done with this article. Just wait for a bit.

138
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:40,560
I will. Take your time.

139
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:42,440
I need to study too.

140
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:57,720
Nowadays...

141
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,820
It is...

142
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:02,820
I'm done.

143
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:04,260
What is that?

144
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:07,190
It's gimbap.

145
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,820
Did you make that for me?

146
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,030
Yes, I did.

147
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:11,460
Please try it.

148
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,930
That looks delicious.

149
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:20,340
Seo Jin, gimbap tastes best when you eat it with your hands.

150
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:22,910
This looks amazing.

151
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:28,250
This is so delicious.

152
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,790
You should try one too.

153
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:35,710
It's okay. I can feed myself.

154
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:38,480
Seo Jin, I want to feed you.

155
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:40,650
Please try this.

156
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:43,190
Here we go!

157
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:44,590
Look at you!

158
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:46,270
You are cute.

159
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,470
Goodness! What is that?

160
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,830
What do you mean? I couldn't see anything.

161
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:55,030
I guess there was nothing.

162
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,980
Look how cute you are!

163
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,610
You're so cute and mischievous.

164
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:04,520
Seo Jin, you know one isn't enough.

165
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,810
Here you go. Open up.

166
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:09,360
- It's okay. I'm fine. - Open up.

167
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,220
Can you watch something else?

168
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:20,070
Please let me watch this.

169
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:22,570
It's new every time I watch it.

170
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:27,580
There are no tissues left.

171
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:33,980
Don't touch the remote control.

172
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:36,340
Gosh.

173
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:37,780
I'm back.

174
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,750
Chewbacca, you're back.

175
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,310
How was your date?

176
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,480
It was all right.

177
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:44,120
Then why do you look so depressed?

178
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,730
- Did you have a fight? - No.

179
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,360
Tae Hyun seems to have a weird habit.

180
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:52,090
- Like what? - He picks his nose a lot.

181
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:55,360
Everyone does that from time to time. It's no big deal.

182
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:57,030
It's more serious than that.

183
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,900
After picking his nose, he ate food with his hand,

184
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:01,870
fed me, and pinched my cheek.

185
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,140
Chewbacca.

186
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,140
You're so selfish.

187
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:06,240
Why?

188
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,570
Tae Hyun said he was okay with your facial hair,

189
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,110
but you can't stand him picking his nose?

190
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,580
They're not the same.

191
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,510
I was born this way. His is a habit.

192
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:16,050
Whatever. If it bothers you so much, talk to him.

193
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,280
Will it be okay? What if he gets angry?

194
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:20,620
If he can accept that you have facial hair, I'm sure he'll be fine.

195
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:22,230
This is my seat.

196
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:27,160
What is it now? Tell us.

197
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:29,770
We're out of toilet paper.

198
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,130
Oh, my head hurts.

199
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,510
- My goodness. - Dong Gu.

200
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,780
I made some porridge. Have some.

201
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,680
I don't feel like eating.

202
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:39,370
How long are you going to be like this?

203
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,940
You're not eating or sleeping. You might die.

204
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:43,980
Leave me alone to die.

205
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,840
I don't want to live any longer.

206
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:48,420
You're crazy.

207
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:52,130
Why would you risk your life for just a girl like Soo Ah?

208
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:54,360
What?

209
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:56,430
Just a girl like Soo Ah?

210
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,000
Are you done?

211
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:00,220
What?

212
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:02,490
Soo Ah might be nothing to you,

213
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,940
but I loved her truly.

214
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:09,100
To me, Soo Ah is a memory I'll never forget...

215
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:11,310
and a wound that will never heal, okay?

216
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:17,950
Why is he taking it out on me? Hey!

217
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,480
What are you doing here alone?

218
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,020
Nothing.

219
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,090
It must be hard for you.

220
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:03,630
A sudden breakup is painful.

221
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:06,370
I've been there too.

222
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:08,740
Dong Gu.

223
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:11,170
No matter how painful it is now,

224
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,700
you can overcome anything with time.

225
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:15,080
- So... - No.

226
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:16,780
I don't think so.

227
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:21,120
I'll never be over Soo Ah even in a hundred years.

228
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:22,740
Why?

229
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,650
I couldn't do much for her.

230
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:27,620
I regret it so much.

231
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:31,890
Do you know what I regret the most?

232
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:38,000
Even our last moment together wasn't beautiful.

233
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:41,840
I wish I could meet her just once more...

234
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,270
and say goodbye to her...

235
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,680
in a beautiful way.

236
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,090
What brings you here?

237
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,870
I have a favor to ask you.

238
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:17,060
What is it?

239
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:20,530
- Can you meet Dong Gu just once? - Why should I?

240
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:22,910
He's suffering a lot.

241
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:25,470
He's not eating or sleeping. He cries all day.

242
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:27,280
What does that have to do with me?

243
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:29,850
You were together for four years.

244
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:32,890
You shouldn't break up like this.

245
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:35,780
- Why don't you meet him and... - In any case,

246
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:37,860
I don't want to meet him. Please go back.

247
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:39,430
I have to work.

248
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:45,120
It'll mean a lot to him. Please meet him just once.

249
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,700
Soo Ah.

250
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:50,640
Please.

251
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,030
Soo Ah.

252
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:55,970
Soo Ah. Just this once.

253
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:58,410
I don't care. Go back now.

254
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:00,300
Soo Ah!

255
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:03,410
Soo Ah, please meet him once.

256
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:06,220
Soo Ah!

257
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:20,430
Why are you staring at me? Do I have something on my face?

258
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,730
No. It's nothing.

259
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:24,840
I'm almost done here. Give me just a second.

260
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:26,740
Okay.

261
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:30,340
(Nose)

262
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:39,320
(Nose)

263
00:14:42,284 --> 00:14:43,590
(Nose)

264
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,430
(Nose)

265
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:51,390
- Tae Hyun. - Gosh, what is it?

266
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:52,900
I'm sorry to say this,

267
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,700
but can you stop picking your nose?

268
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,570
Sorry. I didn't realize.

269
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:02,540
Please don't.

270
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:04,810
Don't.

271
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:08,350
Stop rolling and flicking your booger too.

272
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,990
Okay. I'm sorry.

273
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:16,690
I wasn't sure if I should tell you this,

274
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:20,020
- but I think I have to. - Okay.

275
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:22,250
You pick your nose just too much. Do you know that?

276
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:23,390
Really? Me?

277
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:27,170
Yes. You said your nose often bleeds for no reason.

278
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:28,740
You're wrong.

279
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:31,160
Your nose bleeds because you pick your nose too often.

280
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,010
It must be a habit I wasn't aware of. I'm so sorry.

281
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:39,310
It's okay. You can always break a habit.

282
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:43,520
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

283
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:44,780
You didn't.

284
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,220
You were just concerned about me. Why would it hurt my feelings?

285
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:48,710
That's a relief.

286
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:51,250
Let's grab a beer somewhere.

287
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:53,660
- Let's go. - Okay.

288
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:01,770
Dong Gu, over here.

289
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,300
What is it? Why did you want to see me here?

290
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:08,610
There's this girl I met while working at the convenience store.

291
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,800
She's been asking me to set her up with someone.

292
00:16:10,806 --> 00:16:12,270
- And? - What do you think?

293
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:13,400
I'm setting her up with you.

294
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,770
A new girl will help you get over your ex-girlfriend.

295
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:17,040
- So... - Are you out of your mind?

296
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:20,080
- What's wrong? - Can't you take me more seriously?

297
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:23,350
Thinking of Soo Ah still makes my heart ache.

298
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:24,820
I'm not ready to get over Soo Ah,

299
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,620
and I don't want to. Do you get it?

300
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:28,820
Don't leave like this.

301
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:30,290
- Just say hi. - You're out of your mind.

302
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:31,460
Here she comes.

303
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,130
- Min Ah! - What?

304
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,200
Min Ah, this is my friend, Kang Dong Gu.

305
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:45,550
Hi.

306
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,240
I'm Lee Min Ah.

307
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:48,550
Hi.

308
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,340
I'm saying hi to her for your sake.

309
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:52,920
Don't do this again, okay?

310
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:54,560
Okay.

311
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,780
I've heard a lot about you.

312
00:16:57,786 --> 00:16:59,230
I see.

313
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:01,660
Okay.

314
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,090
Should we go grab a coffee somewhere?

315
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:06,490
Why don't we have a drink instead?

316
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:08,090
- That sounds great. - Min Ah.

317
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,870
Dong Gu has to go.

318
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:14,130
He broke up with a girl recently.

319
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:15,780
He's not ready for a date yet.

320
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:18,110
I see.

321
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,950
Don't worry. It's no problem.

322
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:25,020
Dong Gu, I'm sorry I didn't know how you were feeling.

323
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,720
Go home, and get some rest.

324
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:29,510
Get a lot of rest.

325
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:30,820
Okay.

326
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,550
It was nice meeting you.

327
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:33,960
See you again.

328
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,190
Du Shik, buy me grilled clams, okay?

329
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,290
Okay.

330
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:40,470
How have you been? We haven't talked in a while.

331
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,710
Dong Gu.

332
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,160
Why are you looking back?

333
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:48,640
Are you disappointed?

334
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:50,680
You broke up with Soo Ah only recently.

335
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,410
Pull yourself together.

336
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:58,120
It tastes good.

337
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,040
What food should we order?

338
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,290
Perilla leaves...

339
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,730
Tae Hyun, there you go again.

340
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:10,500
- I'm sorry. - I must do something.

341
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,930
I think we need a special measure.

342
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:15,640
A special measure?

343
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:23,330
Seo Jin, is this really necessary?

344
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,700
It's necessary so you can break your habit.

345
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,100
You don't like it?

346
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:29,140
It's okay. All right.

347
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:30,480
Cheers.

348
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:32,320
Hold on.

349
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,490
- Cheers. - Cheers.

350
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,600
Cheers.

351
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:46,770
Go ahead.

352
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,200
Sorry.

353
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,900
Dong Gu.

354
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:54,300
Oh, it's you.

355
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:56,670
Yes. Min Ah wanted grilled clams.

356
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,110
What are you doing here?

357
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,740
I wanted to drink some soju and sort my thoughts.

358
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:02,910
- By yourself? - Yes.

359
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:04,690
- At a grilled clam place? - Yes. What?

360
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,820
I come here alone a couple of times a week. Is that strange?

361
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:10,180
Would you like to join us?

362
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,360
- Sure. - No.

363
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,900
Dong Gu wants to sort his thoughts alone.

364
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:17,160
He's been suffering a lot lately.

365
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:21,300
Dong Gu, forget about us and eat a lot.

366
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:23,160
Eat as much as you want.

367
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:24,470
I will.

368
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:27,670
I'm leaving.

369
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:29,510
- Here you go. - Thanks.

370
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:34,470
What would you like?

371
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:36,570
I'd like a bottle of soju with grilled clams.

372
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,310
By yourself? It'll be a lot.

373
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:40,780
I always eat it 2 to 3 times a week.

374
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:41,990
I'll take it.

375
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,790
Gosh, this is so much.

376
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:49,950
The amount is endless.

377
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,230
I'll pour you some.

378
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:54,900
- Cheers. - Cheers.

379
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,700
Isn't he so tactless?

380
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:03,000
How can anyone be so tactless like him?

381
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:06,080
- Who is he? - He's Lee Jun Ki, my housemate.

382
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:10,340
He must be born with that personality.

383
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:11,580
How could he be so tactless?

384
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,290
- Let's drink the last shot. - Okay.

385
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,280
That was a good meal.

386
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:19,760
- Shall we go now? - Shall we?

387
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:23,890
Are you leaving too?

388
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:25,890
I was about to leave.

389
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:27,520
You have a lot of clams left.

390
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:30,190
I'll pack them to go for Sol.

391
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,930
You'll give grilled clams to Sol?

392
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,570
She just turned 100 days old.

393
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:36,980
I'll blend them for her.

394
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:39,350
Ma'am, may I pack these?

395
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:54,920
Tae Hyun, you're doing it again.

396
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:57,030
You do it whenever I'm not around.

397
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:01,790
Seo Jin, isn't this too harsh?

398
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,630
What do you mean?

399
00:21:03,632 --> 00:21:06,100
I'll hit you every time you pick your nose.

400
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:08,170
I understand, so let's stop it.

401
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,110
Stop what?

402
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:13,240
Isn't what I say important to you?

403
00:21:13,242 --> 00:21:14,810
Why don't you listen to me?

404
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,710
Please stop.

405
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:18,280
Why are you getting upset?

406
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,880
Is it such a huge sin to pick my nose?

407
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:22,210
I'm doing this for you.

408
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:25,080
Your nose bleeds often, and it's not hygienic.

409
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:26,430
Honestly,

410
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:29,400
it doesn't look good either.

411
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:31,470
"It doesn't look good"?

412
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:37,200
You have facial hair.

413
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:39,260
Why are you bringing that up?

414
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:41,000
I was understanding about your facial hair.

415
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:42,170
Why can't you accept what I do?

416
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,630
How are they the same?

417
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:46,340
I was born with it, but this is your habit.

418
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:48,940
I was born with the tendency to have a lot of boogers.

419
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:50,110
What did you say?

420
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:51,140
Be honest.

421
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:54,220
Which is worse? Your facial hair or me picking my nose?

422
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,920
Do you want to know? Shall I ask around?

423
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,530
Excuse me.

424
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,020
This woman has facial hair like a man.

425
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:04,490
Which is worse, picking one's nose or facial hair?

426
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:06,790
What's wrong with you? You're embarrassing me.

427
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:09,840
Embarrassing? Are you embarrassed of me?

428
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:12,670
I'm embarrassed of you too. Do you know why?

429
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:15,670
When I'm on a date with you all day long,

430
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:19,680
your facial hair starts to grow. I can see it.

431
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:22,920
When I kiss you,

432
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,650
it stings.

433
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:29,180
I apply ointment every time I go home after kissing you.

434
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:30,720
The thought of myself...

435
00:22:30,953 --> 00:22:32,520
I put up with it.

436
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,620
Why do you make me a pathetic person...

437
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:36,750
for picking my nose? Why?

438
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:38,690
Why didn't you tell me before?

439
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:40,570
How did you put up with it?

440
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:42,030
You're so narrow-minded.

441
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,440
"Narrow-minded"?

442
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:45,670
Are you done talking?

443
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:47,860
Yes, I called you narrow-minded.

444
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:50,030
A man shouldn't be so narrow-minded.

445
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:51,500
You're right. I'm narrow-minded.

446
00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:52,540
So what? You're hairy.

447
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,150
Hairy?

448
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,040
You're a booger.

449
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:58,040
- "A booger"? - Yes, you're a booger.

450
00:22:58,046 --> 00:22:59,380
Don't call me that.

451
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:00,440
You're the Wolfman of Huam-dong.

452
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:02,320
"The Wolfman of Huam-dong"?

453
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:05,260
- You're the Booger of Wangshimni. - Wangshimni?

454
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,480
Don't look down on Wangshimni.

455
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:08,720
I can't tolerate that. Let's break up.

456
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:10,050
Let's break up.

457
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:11,490
Don't call me again, Booger.

458
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,490
You better not call me, Wolfman of Huam-dong.

459
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:14,890
I can't hear you, Booger.

460
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,730
- Booger, I can't hear you. - Wolfman.

461
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,030
- Wolfman. - I can't hear you.

462
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:20,310
Please calm down.

463
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:23,940
You startled me.

464
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:26,010
Haven't you left?

465
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:29,640
Please see Dong Gu one last time, please?

466
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:31,270
What's wrong with you?

467
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,810
Did Dong Gu make you do it?

468
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:35,610
- No. - Then why are you doing this?

469
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:37,110
I know how it feels...

470
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,760
not to say goodbye properly to someone you love.

471
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:42,160
I know it better than anyone else.

472
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:45,800
Please see him one last time.

473
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:47,970
I beg you.

474
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:50,830
No.

475
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:53,810
I don't want to see Dong Gu ever again.

476
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,540
Stop wasting your time, and leave.

477
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,550
You're being too harsh.

478
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:01,780
Soo Ah.

479
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:05,990
If you continue, I won't tolerate it.

480
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:08,690
What?

481
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:12,260
What will you do if you won't tolerate it?

482
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,500
- Darn it. - Gosh.

483
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:18,030
My bag.

484
00:24:19,027 --> 00:24:22,100
What's wrong with her? Wait.

485
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:25,900
Thank you for dinner tonight.

486
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:26,930
You're welcome.

487
00:24:26,935 --> 00:24:29,230
Don't forget your blind date on Friday.

488
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:31,240
- What, a blind date? - Okay.

489
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:33,100
Is he introducing her to someone else?

490
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:35,540
I haven't gotten her number yet. He's so disloyal.

491
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:36,940
Hold on.

492
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:39,140
Why do I need her phone number?

493
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:41,150
Are you really interested in her?

494
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:44,720
Wake up. Come back to senses, Dong Gu.

495
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,630
Haven't you left yet?

496
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:54,520
What's wrong?

497
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,660
Something got stuck in my teeth.

498
00:24:56,665 --> 00:24:58,100
Min Ah, do you have a business card?

499
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,230
Why do you need it?

500
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:02,200
Business cards are perfect for picking your teeth.

501
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:03,430
When I have something...

502
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:05,500
stuck in my teeth, I get a seizure. Didn't you know?

503
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:06,800
- I didn't. - I see.

504
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:08,440
Do you have a business card, Min Ah?

505
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:10,640
I have one.

506
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:12,050
Here you go.

507
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:15,780
It's a precious business card that Pig Mother gave you.

508
00:25:15,784 --> 00:25:17,280
How can I use it?

509
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:19,250
That's true. Wait, I might have another one.

510
00:25:19,254 --> 00:25:20,420
Do you have one?

511
00:25:20,422 --> 00:25:22,320
A business card? Wait.

512
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:23,830
I don't have...

513
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,360
I have one from my old company.

514
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:29,560
Is it okay?

515
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:31,800
This is the right angle.

516
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,200
It's my favorite angle.

517
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:36,770
It's perfect for picking teeth.

518
00:25:36,772 --> 00:25:38,980
It's difficult to find it.

519
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:40,900
I'm glad to hear that.

520
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:42,450
Have a good night.

521
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:45,850
This is great.

522
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,090
What's wrong with him?

523
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:51,190
That was smooth.

524
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:54,290
It was brilliant. Awesome.

525
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:01,230
Yoon Ah, please stop.

526
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:04,570
If you promise to meet Dong Gu.

527
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:05,970
Goodness.

528
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:12,100
Give back my bag.

529
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:15,140
I won't let it go unless you promise to meet Dong Gu.

530
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:17,070
What's wrong with you?

531
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:20,380
You shouldn't do this to someone you once loved.

532
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:23,080
Please meet him just once.

533
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,390
Okay, I will.

534
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,780
Really?

535
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:27,780
Where's Dong Gu now?

536
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,500
He probably be in the guesthouse.

537
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,700
Let's go.

538
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:37,840
It's Dong Gu. We met on a blind date today.

539
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:41,710
I just called to see if you went home safely.

540
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,140
It was good to meet you today.

541
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:47,980
Soo Ah.

542
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:51,310
Did you go on a blind date?

543
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:53,640
No, but why are you here?

544
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:56,880
You said that your last wish is to see her one more time.

545
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:58,050
That's true but...

546
00:26:58,053 --> 00:26:59,750
Soo Ah, let me explain.

547
00:26:59,754 --> 00:27:02,250
Dong Gu, let's talk.

548
00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:03,530
What?

549
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,370
Okay, sure.

550
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:18,140
You misunderstood, Soo Ah.

551
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,870
I wasn't thinking about going on a blind date,

552
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:24,010
but Du Shik told me to come out.

553
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:25,850
I must have lost my mind.

554
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm really sorry.

555
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:31,260
Dong Gu.

556
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:35,030
You don't have to apologize.

557
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,200
I don't deserve your apologies either.

558
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:41,200
During the last four years,

559
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,840
thank you so much for liking me.

560
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:45,540
I was happy.

561
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:47,770
- However... - Stop it.

562
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:51,070
What are you trying to say?

563
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:52,550
You should get angry instead.

564
00:27:52,908 --> 00:27:56,350
If you do this, I can't hang onto you.

565
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:58,380
It seems like it's really over.

566
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:04,580
Soo Ah, I'll treat you better.

567
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:06,780
I'll treat you 1,000 times better than that jerk.

568
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:08,800
- Soo Ah, please... - Dong Gu.

569
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:11,130
You already treated me well enough.

570
00:28:12,027 --> 00:28:14,100
What happened wasn't your fault.

571
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:16,100
It was all my fault.

572
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:18,810
I changed.

573
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:21,840
You know what?

574
00:28:21,937 --> 00:28:24,540
I'm so happy to be with Yoon Seok.

575
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:28,650
So please forget about me.

576
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,320
I hope you'll be happy too.

577
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:36,620
I'm sorry.

578
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:39,590
I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

579
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:42,560
I'm really sorry.

580
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,400
Thank you so much...

581
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:53,970
for liking me.

582
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,220
I'll be going now.

583
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:49,360
You always live thinking about tomorrow.

584
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:53,600
Those who live for tomorrow will be killed by the one living for today.

585
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:55,670
I live only for today.

586
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:59,640
You have no idea how messed up that is.

587
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:03,310
I will show you now.

588
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:09,720
Please leave your profile there and leave.

589
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:11,050
Yes, sir.

590
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,950
It was Lee Jun Ki, the new actor!

591
00:30:17,952 --> 00:30:19,530
Please don't forget me.

592
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:27,600
I hope you to make a film that gets 10 million viewers!

593
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:38,470
("Are You Still Dreaming?")

594
00:30:38,473 --> 00:30:40,240
- See you again. - Bye.

595
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,340
See you again.

596
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:42,680
- Bye. - Bye.

597
00:30:43,044 --> 00:30:44,420
I'm home.

598
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:46,210
You suit up. Where did you go like that this morning?

599
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:49,150
I visited every film production with my profile as a work out.

600
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,410
Does that do anything?

601
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,560
You are always in the background with no lines anyway.

602
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:54,920
You are wasting paper.

603
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:56,560
- It's a waste. - What did you say?

604
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:59,300
How can you say that to someone who worked so hard in the morning?

605
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:04,560
That's why your first love called you the Wolfman of Huam-dong.

606
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:06,730
I told you not to say that.

607
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,930
- Stop it. Stop it! - What are you doing?

608
00:31:08,937 --> 00:31:11,870
- I told you to stop! - Guests are here. Don't fight.

609
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,680
- Kang Seo Jin! - Let go, you brat!

610
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:15,710
What is that camera?

611
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,020
What is that for?

612
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:18,940
- I'm filming tomorrow. - Filming?

613
00:31:18,947 --> 00:31:22,080
- What filming? - I'm helping Tae Shik out.

614
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,480
Why do you need an extra job?

615
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:24,860
It's for money.

616
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:26,650
Money? Did anything happen to you?

617
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:29,130
What? Nothing happened.

618
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:33,430
I'm done with Soo Ah.

619
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,170
It looks like Soo Ah has someone better anyway.

620
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,910
I should let her go.

621
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:45,800
What does that have to do with making money though?

622
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:49,480
After breaking up with her, I realize all I have left is films.

623
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:52,220
I think I'll just focus on films more from this year.

624
00:31:53,848 --> 00:31:57,210
I'm going to film our movie this year with enough budget.

625
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:59,450
Jun Ki, practice your acting.

626
00:31:59,454 --> 00:32:02,130
And Du Shik, don't be lazy with your scenario.

627
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:06,230
That's my Dong Gu! You are strong-willed again!

628
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:09,260
Are you going to write everything like you told me though?

629
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:11,540
The one with the president's son reincarnated?

630
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,980
I wonder how many days they can keep up with that.

631
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:29,260
Why are you sighing?

632
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:32,060
What's going on?

633
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,130
Seo Jin,

634
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:35,850
do you have a dream too?

635
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,500
A dream? Yes, I do.

636
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,270
I want to be a journalist.

637
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:42,200
That has been my dream since I was a kid.

638
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,470
But now I can't remember how many times I failed at it.

639
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:47,840
Why are you asking me that?

640
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:49,640
Because I'm envious of it.

641
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:51,280
Everyone has a dream.

642
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:53,580
Dong Gu does, and Jun Ki does too.

643
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:54,940
Du Shik and you also have dreams.

644
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:56,480
How can you be envious of that?

645
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:57,910
Do you not have any dream?

646
00:32:57,912 --> 00:33:00,940
I used to have it, but I can't have one in my situation.

647
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:02,780
What does your situation have to do with your dream?

648
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:04,610
You know what I'm going through.

649
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:05,960
I have Sol too.

650
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:10,660
Yoon Ah, do you know about J. K. Rowling?

651
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:12,890
She was also a divorcee with a child.

652
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:15,760
Her only income was 15 dollars a week from the government.

653
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:18,360
She even ran out of formula, so she had to water it down.

654
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:21,470
Do you know what book she wrote going through all that?

655
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:25,240
It's the Harry Potter series.

656
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,900
Having a lack of time, being in a bad situation,

657
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,910
and having poor parents...

658
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,850
Those are just excuses.

659
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:34,750
So tell me. What is your dream?

660
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:38,830
I will help you out. So just tell me.

661
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:42,030
I want to be a rapper.

662
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:43,760
A rapper?

663
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:47,290
Like Dok2 and B.I?

664
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:49,240
Why? Is that weird?

665
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,210
I don't think it's weird. It's just not what I expected.

666
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,500
Are you good at rapping though?

667
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:55,040
I can do it a little bit.

668
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:57,880
- Do you want me to show you? - Okay.

669
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:05,980
Yes, get it

670
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,850
The world in front of me it is a fantasy

671
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,910
It's a nice meal

672
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,910
The best of it is the Prime Minister's Award

673
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,080
Or is it a Presidential Award? Is that true?

674
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:16,320
You are lingerie, Misari, and the third wheel

675
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:19,000
You are Misery!

676
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:25,040
what do you think?

677
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,170
That's very unique.

678
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:29,730
I think you'll get better if you practice a bit more.

679
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:33,070
Do you really think so? Do you think I should go for this?

680
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,450
Of course! Why not?

681
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:37,070
That's your dream.

682
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,480
Thank you, Seo Jin.

683
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:41,710
If it wasn't you, I would've only thought about it instead of trying.

684
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:44,190
- I can't thank you enough. - Don't worry about it.

685
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,960
Cheer up.

686
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:51,230
Private Kim, wake up. You can't die like this.

687
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:53,900
Let's go back home alive.

688
00:34:54,162 --> 00:34:56,160
Mayday! Mayday!

689
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:58,600
It's an emergency.

690
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,880
Private Kim, we are almost there. Hang in there!

691
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:07,110
Private Kim!

692
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,220
You jerks.

693
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,190
I will see you again in the afterlife.

694
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,590
- This is what I've prepared! - Well, you are...

695
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:28,930
aware of what kind of movie you are auditioning for, right?

696
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,240
Of course, sir!

697
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,960
It's called "Marine". Isn't it about special operations marine?

698
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,370
No, it's not. Our film is about a swimmer.

699
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,670
It's about Marine Boy, Park Tae Hwan.

700
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:38,330
It's about swimming, the Olympics, and youth!

701
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,570
I'm sorry, sir.

702
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:41,440
I've been auditioning for so many films these days.

703
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:43,070
Please let me try once more.

704
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:44,470
No, you don't have to do that.

705
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,050
Just go.

706
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:49,350
Please give me one more chance, sir.

707
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,680
I'm good at swimming.

708
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:53,150
I'm okay with a small role. You don't even need to pay me.

709
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:55,390
Please give me anything to do, sir.

710
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:56,850
Please!

711
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:59,330
Alright. Can you take off your clothes?

712
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:01,500
What?

713
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:02,960
Why do you want that all of a sudden?

714
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,630
It's about swimmers.

715
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:07,730
So I should look at your body if I want to give you a small role.

716
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:09,440
Oh, I see. I'll take my clothes off.

717
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,640
Wait, wait!

718
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:15,150
Is that all your hair?

719
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:16,840
Yes, it's hair.

720
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,740
- Are your legs like that too? - Yes!

721
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:21,580
- I have a lot of testosterone. - You didn't get a role.

722
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:23,410
- What? - Zipper yourself up, and get out.

723
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:24,580
Why?

724
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:26,580
Have you seen any swimmers who have so much hair like you?

725
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:28,820
They shave it all to reduce the air resistance.

726
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:31,050
Not only they shave their heads, they also shave their armpits.

727
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,070
They even shave their most important parts too!

728
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:38,760
I will shave them all.

729
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:41,810
Except for my head, I will get rid of every hair on my body.

730
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,380
Don't worry about it, sir!

731
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:46,250
"Marine"!

732
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:07,200
This is where you get waxed.

733
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:15,900
Do I really have to do this?

734
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:17,210
This is driving me crazy.

735
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:19,500
What is this?

736
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:21,210
Who put such a worn-out doll here?

737
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:24,070
- Oh, my gosh! - Hello.

738
00:37:24,078 --> 00:37:25,810
Hi, who are you?

739
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:27,840
I'll be waxing you today.

740
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,450
Are you? Really?

741
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,710
Don't be embarrassed.

742
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,490
Many men get waxed these days.

743
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:35,550
Really?

744
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:38,020
I see. Let's do this. I don't have much time anyway.

745
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,990
Please lie on your back. I'll start it shortly.

746
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:41,860
By the way, do you want me to get rid of this?

747
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:44,090
Just keep it. You'll need it.

748
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:46,510
Please take off your robe.

749
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,550
I'll start now.

750
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,790
Please bear the pain no matter what.

751
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,830
I'll get rid of the sheet.

752
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,730
What's happening now?

753
00:38:20,301 --> 00:38:24,080
I guess that's why this is here.

754
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,250
("President Ms. Bruce Lee")

755
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:34,580
("President Ms. Bruce Lee")

756
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:36,680
Are you manipulating the view counts again?

757
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:37,980
Do you have to do that?

758
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,960
Everyone does this.

759
00:38:40,388 --> 00:38:42,660
Why isn't it going up? This is annoying.

760
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,050
- Seo Jin. - Yes?

761
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,360
Can I borrow your ID?

762
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,900
- Why? - I want to leave some comments.

763
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:49,470
No.

764
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:54,130
Seo Jin, I wrote a song.

765
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:55,710
- Would you mind listening to it? - What?

766
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,510
You already finished writing a song?

767
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:01,380
A song? What song is that?

768
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:04,110
Yoon Ah's dream is to be a rapper.

769
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:05,410
A rapper?

770
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:07,340
Does that mean you rap?

771
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:08,590
Yes.

772
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,310
I wrote a song while thinking about Seo Jin.

773
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,380
Do you want to hear it?

774
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:14,250
Sure, of course.

775
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:16,560
I didn't know this about you.

776
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:19,870
Drop the beat.

777
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,070
Yes, get it

778
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:29,600
You have eyes like a hawk

779
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:32,170
Hunting for a scoop

780
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:34,570
On a hungry afternoon

781
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:37,270
Try to fool me, show me your mind

782
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:38,670
Hide yourself

783
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,480
Once caught, you'll be smashed

784
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:44,520
If you're scared, freeze

785
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,500
What do you think?

786
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,460
Well, I liked it.

787
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:57,060
It was very unique...

788
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:59,170
and had a grotesque charm.

789
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Really?

790
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,470
I have another one. Do you want to hear it too?

791
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,270
No. I mean, I have to take a shower.

792
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,880
I'll hear it later. Later.

793
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:21,190
Seo Jin, here we go.

794
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,320
Get it

795
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:26,560
My name is Han Yoon Ah

796
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,690
In English, it's Yoon Ah Han

797
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:32,730
Your name is Kang Seo Jin

798
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:36,140
Backwards, it's Jin Seo Kang

799
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:38,140
Gosh.

800
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:40,380
What a surprise.

801
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:43,780
How can she become a rapper like that?

802
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,010
What are you doing? Get out!

803
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,910
I'm sorry. You should have made some sound.

804
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,760
How can I make a sound while taking a shower?

805
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:57,000
Hold on.

806
00:40:57,925 --> 00:41:01,260
Jun Ki. What happened to you?

807
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:02,460
Nothing.

808
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:04,340
Something happened. What is this?

809
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:06,060
- Nothing happened. - Let me see.

810
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:07,560
Where did everything go?

811
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:10,000
- It's just your imagination. - No, it isn't. Let me see.

812
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:12,340
- Stop turning me around. - Your armpits...

813
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:17,210
What? A Brazilian wax?

814
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:18,880
Why did you do it?

815
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:20,910
It was the director's order.

816
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:22,550
I had to do it to get the role.

817
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,610
You're doing all kinds of ridiculous things.

818
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:25,720
What's your role?

819
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,960
Swimmer 8.

820
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,050
You don't even have a name?

821
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:30,620
I'm sure you don't have any lines either.

822
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,760
It's an important role.

823
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,920
There's even a Swimmer 28.

824
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:35,960
Is that so?

825
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:38,530
That sounds amazing. There will be 28 swimmers?

826
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:39,810
Be quiet.

827
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:42,510
It's Ji Soo.

828
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:44,730
Hello. Hi, Ji Soo.

829
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,300
Yes, it's me, Jun Ki.

830
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:48,570
Tomorrow? I don't have any plans. Why?

831
00:41:48,576 --> 00:41:50,170
With your mom?

832
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,840
Of course. Okay.

833
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:54,750
See you tomorrow. Bye.

834
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,790
Did you already find a new girl?

835
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:58,610
I wonder how many days it'll last this time.

836
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:00,890
It's serious this time.

837
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:03,560
I'm even meeting her mom for a meal.

838
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:06,190
Really? It must be really serious this time.

839
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,820
It is.

840
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:11,430
She feels completely different from the other girls.

841
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:13,800
Dong Gu, when you were with Soo Ah,

842
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,670
did you get this feeling here?

843
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:21,250
Well, I guess.

844
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,720
- Hey. - What?

845
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:30,510
I was just curious. I'm sorry.

846
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:33,130
No, it's okay. There's no need to be sorry.

847
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:36,950
- Good luck. - Thanks.

848
00:42:36,957 --> 00:42:38,360
Gosh.

849
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,190
You're so insensitive.

850
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:43,230
Why would you talk about Soo Ah?

851
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,490
I didn't mean to.

852
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:46,800
Also, he said it was okay, so why are you having a fit?

853
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:49,030
He doesn't seem okay.

854
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:50,930
He's okay. Worry about yourself.

855
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:52,580
Thank you very much.

856
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:00,220
(Delete)

857
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,740
What are you doing here?

858
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,270
Nothing.

859
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:24,010
You were thinking about Soo Ah, weren't you?

860
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:29,070
It's hard, right?

861
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:32,050
You don't have to say anything. I know how hard it is.

862
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:37,090
I also know that no words could comfort you.

863
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:41,330
So I prepared something for you.

864
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:45,960
What is it?

865
00:43:47,962 --> 00:43:50,900
Yes, get it

866
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:54,100
A broken heart

867
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:55,200
Tears fall down

868
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:58,170
Candy doesn't cry even when she's lonely or sad

869
00:43:58,172 --> 00:43:59,810
Neither does Dong Gu

870
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,820
What are you doing now? Why are you suddenly rapping?

871
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:05,270
Look at my eyes, Red sun

872
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:08,650
Forget about Soo Ah, get over her

873
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:12,150
Stop it. Why are you rapping? Have you lost your mind?

874
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,380
Run

875
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:14,820
Run towards your dreams

876
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:16,790
Keep going, Where?

877
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,320
Stop it. Why are you rapping?

878
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:21,760
You're so weird. Why are you doing this?

879
00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:24,130
Are you ready? Let's go

880
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:25,630
- Stop it. - Here we go

881
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,710
- What's with you? - Yes

882
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:36,280
Where's Jun Ki?

883
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:39,480
He got all dressed up to meet his girlfriend's mom.

884
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,950
Oh, right.

885
00:44:41,148 --> 00:44:42,510
You're working today, right?

886
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:44,580
Yes. I have to film a party.

887
00:44:44,585 --> 00:44:45,680
Are you going to the library?

888
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,950
Yes. I'm meeting my study group.

889
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,950
The link between you and me

890
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:52,530
The sound within us

891
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:56,630
What's up with her?

892
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,630
Her dream is to become a rapper.

893
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:01,400
A rapper? When she's that bad?

894
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:03,400
I shouldn't have encouraged her.

895
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:04,600
It's driving me crazy.

896
00:45:04,605 --> 00:45:06,780
You encouraged her?

897
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,340
There's nothing wrong with dreaming, but she's just too bad.

898
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:11,910
Stop her before it's too late.

899
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,610
You never know what she'll get up to.

900
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:15,610
She's so serious I can't bring myself to tell her.

901
00:45:15,616 --> 00:45:18,290
Find a way. I have to go now.

902
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:20,760
- Take one. - I'm okay.

903
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,750
The link between you and me

904
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:24,930
The sound within us

905
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:26,800
The sound

906
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:35,360
Ji Soo has been bragging about you so much,

907
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:37,370
so I was getting curious about you.

908
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:41,070
Just like Ji Soo said, you're very handsome and polite.

909
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:42,340
I'm flattered, but it's not true.

910
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:44,510
Goodness. You're modest too.

911
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:46,350
Thank you.

912
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:49,410
- Excuse me. - Go ahead.

913
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,410
- Hello. - Are you okay?

914
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:53,060
- Really? I'll be right there. - I'm nervous. Eat up.

915
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:55,480
What should I do?

916
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:58,450
Something came up. I have to go now.

917
00:45:58,459 --> 00:45:59,520
I'm sorry.

918
00:45:59,526 --> 00:46:00,960
No problem.

919
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:02,790
- Drive safely. - Okay.

920
00:46:02,796 --> 00:46:04,130
I'll say goodbye here.

921
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,970
I'm Lee Jun Ki.

922
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:13,740
I was so nervous.

923
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:15,550
My legs feel weak.

924
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:18,610
How did I do?

925
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:21,210
My mom seems to like you a lot.

926
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:22,450
Really?

927
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:26,120
That's a relief. Good job, Jun Ki.

928
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,420
- Why is she so late? - Is someone else coming?

929
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:32,860
My little sister got off work early and wants to meet you.

930
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,400
I'm getting nervous again.

931
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,600
- I'm sorry. - No problem.

932
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,130
Jun Ki, meet my sister.

933
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:42,000
This is my little sister, Ji Min.

934
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:45,110
- I'm Lee Jun Ki. - Hello.

935
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:53,090
I'll be waxing you today.

936
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:55,550
What?

937
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,720
What's wrong? Have you two met before?

938
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,490
Well...

939
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:04,200
What is it? Tell me.

940
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:07,460
Don't tell me you two have dated.

941
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:10,090
- No. - No way.

942
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:11,490
That's absurd.

943
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:12,860
Then what is it?

944
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:15,110
What is it, Ji Min? Tell me.

945
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:18,870
The thing is, your boyfriend visited our shop...

946
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:21,380
as a customer yesterday.

947
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,250
He did?

948
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,550
Did you get a wax?

949
00:47:26,313 --> 00:47:30,280
Well, it's for my role.

950
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:31,310
It's work-related.

951
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:33,080
That's it?

952
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:35,960
It's no problem as long as you didn't do it yourself.

953
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:41,670
What is it?

954
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:43,670
No way.

955
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:46,810
Did you wax him yourself?

956
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,110
Say no.

957
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:50,770
There were no male waxers.

958
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:53,070
Don't get any strange idea.

959
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:54,700
It's my work.

960
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,800
- It's work. - It's work.

961
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:57,950
It's just work.

962
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,320
Ji Soo!

963
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:03,010
Ji Soo!

964
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:05,090
Hold on.

965
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:07,160
I'm sorry.

966
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:11,220
I had no idea she was your sister.

967
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:13,690
It was for a movie. I had no choice.

968
00:48:13,694 --> 00:48:16,020
I haven't even held your hand yet,

969
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,800
but my sister...

970
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:19,390
saw everything.

971
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,640
Everything?

972
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:25,180
Well...

973
00:48:25,606 --> 00:48:29,080
It's her work.

974
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,920
All right.

975
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:32,920
But I still feel a bit uncomfortable.

976
00:48:33,514 --> 00:48:34,880
I'll be going home now.

977
00:48:34,882 --> 00:48:37,280
Wait, Ji Soo.

978
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:38,890
Ji Soo!

979
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:40,650
My goodness.

980
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:43,730
Why does she have to be Ji Soo's sister?

981
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:45,060
Gosh.

982
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,400
Darn it.

983
00:48:50,564 --> 00:48:53,000
- Is everything going well? - Yes.

984
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,360
You haven't done this in a while. Are you sure you'll be all right?

985
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:58,130
I'm Kang Dong Gu. You know I'm good.

986
00:48:58,138 --> 00:49:00,200
If that's the case, you should be working in the film industry.

987
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,110
Why are you doing this?

988
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,070
Have you given up on films too?

989
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:06,990
No, I'll start again soon.

990
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:09,210
But I need money for that.

991
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:11,510
You shouldn't give up like me.

992
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:13,550
Do it as long as you can, okay?

993
00:49:13,554 --> 00:49:15,090
Yes, thank you.

994
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:18,650
Stop crying, Min Seo.

995
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,430
The party is about to start.

996
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:23,030
Will you keep taking photos?

997
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,940
- The baby is crying. - Pardon?

998
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:26,200
What do you mean?

999
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,930
Other photographers make the baby laugh when he cries.

1000
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,200
Please do something.

1001
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:32,410
Make him laugh?

1002
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:34,270
I'm not a comedian.

1003
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:36,310
Gosh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

1004
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,270
It's his first time on the job. I apologize.

1005
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:40,620
Excuse me.

1006
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:44,210
What are you doing?

1007
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:46,420
What should I do about the baby crying?

1008
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,790
You have to be better at making babies laugh for this job.

1009
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,100
Watch carefully.

1010
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,770
Min Seo.

1011
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:57,040
Look at me.

1012
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,350
Peekaboo.

1013
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,220
He's so adorable.

1014
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:16,780
Did you see that?

1015
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:18,120
This is how you do it.

1016
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:19,410
You try it.

1017
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:20,780
Are you telling me to try it?

1018
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:23,200
Do you think earning money is easy?

1019
00:50:23,724 --> 00:50:25,820
Forget it if you don't want to. Leave.

1020
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:28,420
No, I'll do it.

1021
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:29,840
Do it well.

1022
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,340
Do it well, okay?

1023
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:54,960
Seo Jin, may I borrow your laptop?

1024
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:56,430
Why do you need it?

1025
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,520
I need to apply to participate in something.

1026
00:50:58,525 --> 00:50:59,930
Participate in what?

1027
00:51:00,794 --> 00:51:02,500
I want to go on "Show Me the Money".

1028
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:04,730
"Show Me the Money"?

1029
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:07,240
I want to be evaluated by professionals.

1030
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:11,970
Yoon Ah, isn't it too early for that?

1031
00:51:11,972 --> 00:51:13,000
I know.

1032
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:15,580
I know that my rap isn't at a professional level.

1033
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:18,680
However, I think I can overcome it.

1034
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,850
Listen, Yoon Ah.

1035
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:24,960
I didn't say it as not to hurt your feelings,

1036
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:26,530
but your rap is terrible.

1037
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:27,820
What do you mean?

1038
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:29,860
It's terrible in every way.

1039
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,720
Is my rap that bad?

1040
00:51:32,726 --> 00:51:35,770
Most people can rap like you.

1041
00:51:35,996 --> 00:51:37,840
I can do it too. Want to hear it?

1042
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:42,260
Insomnia, restlessness, I'm a zombie in the air

1043
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,870
With some refreshing water, I can remove the weight of reality

1044
00:51:45,872 --> 00:51:49,780
My running is beautiful like there are flames behind my feet

1045
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,650
See? Don't you think I'm better than you?

1046
00:51:52,913 --> 00:51:54,320
I see.

1047
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:56,890
I see how it is.

1048
00:51:57,684 --> 00:51:59,460
Why didn't you tell me before?

1049
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:01,090
I'm sorry.

1050
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:05,760
- I didn't want to hurt your... - No, it's okay.

1051
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,870
Don't worry.

1052
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,270
Was I being too harsh?

1053
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:19,110
I shouldn't have encouraged her.

1054
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:21,050
I don't know anymore.

1055
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,670
Gosh, the noodles got soggy.

1056
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:27,790
- I'm so hungry. - You're back.

1057
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:29,910
What's wrong? Did something happen?

1058
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:31,320
Don't ask.

1059
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:33,660
Did you make that just now?

1060
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,760
Let me have one bite.

1061
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:40,820
No way.

1062
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:42,600
Make your own if you want some.

1063
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:45,390
Didn't you eat with your girlfriend's mom?

1064
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,900
I couldn't eat properly.

1065
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,740
Let me have a bite. Give it to me.

1066
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,170
Make your own.

1067
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:53,650
You're so stingy.

1068
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,600
Let me have one bite.

1069
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:56,920
Are you holding on to it?

1070
00:52:58,211 --> 00:53:01,090
You're so strong. Do you lift weights?

1071
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:04,250
- Hey. - Give it back. I made it.

1072
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:05,790
My goodness.

1073
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:09,620
You just wasted it.

1074
00:53:09,623 --> 00:53:10,930
What's going on?

1075
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:12,830
It's seeping through.

1076
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:26,870
- Kang Seo Jin. - I'm sorry.

1077
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:28,450
I'm so sorry.

1078
00:53:28,642 --> 00:53:30,470
Am I useless as a man now?

1079
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:32,710
Doctor, what should I do?

1080
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:34,490
My life is over.

1081
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:36,420
Kang Seo Jin.

1082
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:40,260
How could you?

1083
00:53:41,455 --> 00:53:44,250
What are you doing? Can't you do something?

1084
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:45,320
I'm sorry.

1085
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:47,660
Could you call the professor again?

1086
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:49,500
- Please? - She's on her way.

1087
00:53:50,497 --> 00:53:53,830
Why did you call me when I just finished an operation?

1088
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:57,870
It's because the intern is too embarrassed to see the patient.

1089
00:53:57,871 --> 00:54:00,540
Do you call yourself a doctor?

1090
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,750
I'll have a word with you later.

1091
00:54:02,843 --> 00:54:05,720
What happened to the patient?

1092
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:09,550
- Is that you, Jun Ki? - Who is it?

1093
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:13,320
It's me, Ji Soo's mom.

1094
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,850
Mom, could you do something?

1095
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:16,190
You startled me.

1096
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,670
Ma'am.

1097
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,490
What brings you here?

1098
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:24,160
I'm a doctor at this hospital.

1099
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:26,640
What happened to you?

1100
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,610
He spilled hot ramyeon over him.

1101
00:54:29,069 --> 00:54:31,500
My goodness.

1102
00:54:31,505 --> 00:54:33,300
Let's take a look first.

1103
00:54:33,306 --> 00:54:34,610
Ma'am.

1104
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:37,610
No, it's okay.

1105
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:38,970
I'm okay.

1106
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,520
I'll go back home now.

1107
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,850
You're not okay. You can't go in this condition.

1108
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:47,180
No, ma'am.

1109
00:54:47,187 --> 00:54:49,290
I'm really okay.

1110
00:54:49,556 --> 00:54:53,360
Listen to me. I'm a doctor before I'm Ji Soo's mom.

1111
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,760
Ms. Kim, hold down the patient.

1112
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:56,940
- Yes, ma'am. - Hold down what? Why?

1113
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,790
Why?

1114
00:54:58,798 --> 00:54:59,900
Stay still.

1115
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,770
No, no.

1116
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:04,200
Ma'am, no.

1117
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:05,700
- No. - Stay still.

1118
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:07,740
- No, ma'am. - Don't move.

1119
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:09,970
No, don't do it.

1120
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:11,450
Don't!

1121
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:32,040
What happened?

1122
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:36,240
I'm sorry.

1123
00:55:45,245 --> 00:55:49,840
It's rare to be burnt like this with hot ramyeon.

1124
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:51,850
So that was why.

1125
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:53,120
Yes.

1126
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:55,120
The treatment went well.

1127
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:57,130
- You may go. - Thank you.

1128
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:58,960
Ma'am.

1129
00:56:03,296 --> 00:56:04,640
Jun Ki.

1130
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:08,130
Ji Soo.

1131
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:10,070
Hello.

1132
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,710
I need to make rounds. See you.

1133
00:56:13,073 --> 00:56:15,850
I'll be outside, Jun Ki.

1134
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:20,980
Ji Soo.

1135
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:24,120
Why do you do this to me, Jun Ki?

1136
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,360
You got a wax from my sister.

1137
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:27,880
And now my mom.

1138
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:30,430
Are you planning to show it to all my family except me?

1139
00:56:30,857 --> 00:56:33,690
How can I look at my mom and sister now?

1140
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:35,930
- Listen, Ji Soo. - Forget it.

1141
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,460
I don't want to hear it.

1142
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:38,760
Let's break up.

1143
00:56:38,765 --> 00:56:41,060
What? Break up?

1144
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:43,160
- What do you mean? - I'm sorry.

1145
00:56:43,169 --> 00:56:44,940
I don't think I can bear it.

1146
00:56:45,772 --> 00:56:47,350
Goodbye, Jun Ki.

1147
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,250
We were fine. Wait, Ji Soo.

1148
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:51,620
Ji Soo.

1149
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,890
Ji Soo. Ji Soo.

1150
00:56:58,084 --> 00:57:00,430
Wait, Ji Soo.

1151
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:03,490
Ji Soo, please listen to me.

1152
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,100
Ji Soo.

1153
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,930
Ji Soo!

1154
00:57:15,335 --> 00:57:19,170
There are three bears in the house

1155
00:57:19,172 --> 00:57:22,650
Daddy bear, mommy bear, and baby bear

1156
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:27,480
What are you doing?

1157
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,880
You're making him cry more.

1158
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:30,680
- Is there anything else? - Something else?

1159
00:57:30,684 --> 00:57:31,920
I'll try again.

1160
00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:03,860
Our son, Min Seo. Thank you for being in our lives.

1161
00:58:03,883 --> 00:58:05,380
Happy first birthday.

1162
00:58:05,385 --> 00:58:07,060
We love you forever.

1163
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:30,650
Did you hit your head until it bled?

1164
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,960
I had to do it to make the baby laugh. I had no choice.

1165
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,050
It's hard to make a living.

1166
00:58:40,053 --> 00:58:41,360
It's hard.

1167
00:58:42,455 --> 00:58:45,630
Ji Soo, please listen to me.

1168
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:47,920
Don't hang up, Ji Soo.

1169
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:49,420
I didn't do it on purpose.

1170
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:52,200
Please hear me out, Ji Soo. Ji Soo, wait.

1171
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:56,200
Why? Does she really want to break up?

1172
00:58:56,202 --> 00:58:57,510
Yes.

1173
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:00,450
Why did you get a waxing in the first place?

1174
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:04,280
Extras like me don't have a choice but to do as the directors say.

1175
00:59:04,444 --> 00:59:06,520
I'm sure you'll meet someone better.

1176
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:07,920
Cheer up.

1177
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:11,210
I'm sad about breaking up with Ji Soo,

1178
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:14,490
but the thought that I might end up being an extra forever...

1179
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:16,120
makes me feel depressed.

1180
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:18,430
Why would you say such a foolish thing like that?

1181
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:20,860
Jun Ki. The actor, Hwang Jung Min,

1182
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,820
was an obscure actor for ten years,

1183
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:25,260
and Kwak Do Won was an obscure actor for almost twenty years.

1184
00:59:25,265 --> 00:59:26,470
So what are you saying?

1185
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,260
Are you saying I'll be an extra for twenty years?

1186
00:59:28,268 --> 00:59:29,730
I'm trying to tell you that if you work hard you could become...

1187
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,340
a great actor like Hwang Jung Min or Kwak Do Won.

1188
00:59:32,505 --> 00:59:35,610
You might slack off at times, but you do have talent in acting.

1189
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:39,370
You're right. I am pretty good.

1190
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:40,890
People do say I have talent.

1191
00:59:40,947 --> 00:59:44,460
Gosh. Let's cheer up guys.

1192
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:48,180
If we stay positive, I'm sure someday our dreams will come true.

1193
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:49,860
He's right. I agree.

1194
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:51,730
But in order to cheer up,

1195
00:59:51,991 --> 00:59:54,960
let's eat first. What do you say? I'm starving. Let's eat.

1196
00:59:54,961 --> 00:59:57,790
- You're always hungry. - When are you ever not hungry?

1197
00:59:57,797 --> 00:59:59,440
Answer me right now. Tell me.

1198
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,140
I see muffins!

1199
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:05,410
These will have to do for dinner today.

1200
01:00:05,538 --> 01:00:08,840
I wasn't in the mood to go grocery shopping, so I just made muffins.

1201
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:10,180
Yoon Ah.

1202
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,910
Are you still mad?

1203
01:00:11,911 --> 01:00:13,910
No. I'm not mad at all.

1204
01:00:13,913 --> 01:00:16,790
I'm perfectly fine. I couldn't be happier.

1205
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:20,730
I see. You're not angry. You don't seem angry at all.

1206
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,430
- You made this yourself? - Why?

1207
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:31,790
Can you bake muffins as well as I do?

1208
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:34,330
Does everyone in the world bake as well as me?

1209
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:36,810
It's not that. It's really good.

1210
01:00:36,836 --> 01:00:39,330
You guys should try one too. Try one.

1211
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:40,850
- Shall we? - Let's give it a try.

1212
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:48,810
It really is good.

1213
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,950
Yoon Ah. Did you really bake these yourself?

1214
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,410
I agree. This is better than the ones sold in bakeries.

1215
01:00:53,419 --> 01:00:55,250
- Yes, I agree. - Really?

1216
01:00:55,255 --> 01:00:56,890
Believe me.

1217
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:59,320
Yoon Ah. Rather than a rapper, why don't you...

1218
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:01,260
try becoming a pastry chef?

1219
01:01:01,261 --> 01:01:02,860
A pastry chef?

1220
01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:05,730
To be honest, my second dream was to become a pastry chef.

1221
01:01:05,732 --> 01:01:08,330
Really? Then you should try becoming a pastry chef.

1222
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:11,870
Should I? But I still want to become a rapper.

1223
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:14,780
- Yoon Ah. - All right. I was just kidding.

1224
01:01:16,142 --> 01:01:17,440
- Is it really good? - Yes.

1225
01:01:17,443 --> 01:01:18,470
You should become a pastry chef.

1226
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:19,910
It's pretty tasty.

1227
01:01:19,913 --> 01:01:21,880
- Really? - You've found a talent.

1228
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:23,090
It's really good?

1229
01:01:30,723 --> 01:01:32,450
That's nice and neat. I like it.

1230
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,100
That's good. Let's go with that.

1231
01:01:36,562 --> 01:01:39,460
Hey. I like it. You look great.

1232
01:01:39,465 --> 01:01:42,000
What did I tell you? Now that you've gotten rid of the hair,

1233
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:44,300
you look like a real swimmer.

1234
01:01:44,304 --> 01:01:47,080
Thank you. I'll do my best.

1235
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:50,980
Gosh. Did you even shave your armpits?

1236
01:01:52,211 --> 01:01:54,220
Good job. Next person!

1237
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:56,420
Yes!

1238
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:57,960
My goodness. You startled me.

1239
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:01,980
Did you really shave you head?

1240
01:02:01,988 --> 01:02:03,530
Yes, sir.

1241
01:02:05,158 --> 01:02:08,270
As long as it makes me look like a real swimmer, I don't need my hair.

1242
01:02:08,528 --> 01:02:10,630
I love it. I'm really impressed.

1243
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,590
This is what a true actor should be like.

1244
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:14,540
Director. Soo Hyun has arrived.

1245
01:02:14,834 --> 01:02:16,140
- Really? - Yes, sir.

1246
01:02:17,203 --> 01:02:20,240
It's cold. I'm freezing. Let's hurry up and shoot the scene.

1247
01:02:20,773 --> 01:02:22,940
Soo Hyun. You didn't get a wax?

1248
01:02:22,942 --> 01:02:25,270
You know how I can't stand the cold.

1249
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:27,040
I'd be too cold without hair. I'll catch a cold.

1250
01:02:27,046 --> 01:02:28,880
This is about swimmers.

1251
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:31,380
If you act like this it won't look as real.

1252
01:02:31,384 --> 01:02:32,660
Director.

1253
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:36,150
My role is a swimmer. I'm not a swimmer in real life, am I?

1254
01:02:36,155 --> 01:02:39,400
If you insist on getting a wax, you should look for another actor.

1255
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:41,120
No, no. That's not what I'm saying.

1256
01:02:41,127 --> 01:02:43,560
It's not that important how real this looks.

1257
01:02:43,563 --> 01:02:44,960
Let's go ahead and shoot the scene.

1258
01:02:44,964 --> 01:02:47,800
Wait. Why do these guys look so sleek?

1259
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,430
They'll make me stand out.

1260
01:02:49,435 --> 01:02:51,170
The viewers won't be happy about that.

1261
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,600
I can't shoot this like this.

1262
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:56,110
Gosh. You're right. What should we do?

1263
01:02:56,876 --> 01:02:59,540
We'll now shoot the scene where the spectators cheer.

1264
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:03,210
Everyone must cheer with emotion as if this were real.

1265
01:03:03,216 --> 01:03:04,410
Yes, sir.

1266
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:07,860
Ready. Action!

1267
01:03:09,322 --> 01:03:11,100
- Go for it! - You can do it!

1268
01:03:13,726 --> 01:03:16,120
- You can do it! - You can do it!

1269
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:18,340
- Go Korea! - Go Korea!

1270
01:03:19,298 --> 01:03:21,410
- Go Korea! - Go Korea!

1271
01:03:22,468 --> 01:03:24,610
- Go Korea! - Go Korea!

1272
01:03:25,705 --> 01:03:30,850
- Go Korea! - Go Korea!

1273
01:03:31,577 --> 01:03:33,880
Go Korea!

1274
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:55,910
(Thank you Lee Ji Ha and Han Ji Sang for their special appearances.)

1275
01:04:04,544 --> 01:04:07,910
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1276
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:09,280
I've got big news! I've got big news!

1277
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:11,580
Me, Lee Jun Ki, has been cast in a role.

1278
01:04:11,584 --> 01:04:14,750
Guess who my counterpart will be? The one and only Kim Hee Ja!

1279
01:04:14,754 --> 01:04:18,320
I can't stand people like him who rely on their connections.

1280
01:04:18,324 --> 01:04:21,200
- Wait. This is a rehearsal. - What? A rehearsal?

1281
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:23,290
I told you to go easy on him.

1282
01:04:23,296 --> 01:04:24,930
He's been hospitalized. It'll take him four weeks to recover.

1283
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:26,990
This is someone else's baby's 100th day party. What are you doing?

1284
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:29,160
What if the guests see you?

1285
01:04:29,168 --> 01:04:30,540
My little baby!

1286
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,230
This is driving me crazy.

1287
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:34,840
I passed! I passed!

1288
01:04:34,841 --> 01:04:36,270
This interview is unique isn't it?

1289
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:37,440
Do you two have boyfriends?

1290
01:04:37,443 --> 01:04:39,040
I prefer glamorous girls.

1291
01:04:39,045 --> 01:04:40,440
(2018 Daeyoung Newspaper Job Interview)

1292
01:04:40,446 --> 01:04:42,110
If you want to drink that badly,

1293
01:04:42,115 --> 01:04:44,280
why don't you have your real sister come drink with you?

1294
01:04:44,283 --> 01:04:45,510
Have you lost your mind?

1295
01:04:45,518 --> 01:04:47,930
Get your hand off me when I tell you nicely.

1296
01:04:48,921 --> 01:04:52,320
Yoon Ah. You just got here and you've been selected.

1297
01:04:52,325 --> 01:04:54,790
What happened between Sol's father and you?

1298
01:04:54,794 --> 01:04:57,090
Her life story is something we'd see in dramas.

1299
01:04:57,096 --> 01:04:58,590
How about we try meeting Sol's father?

1300
01:04:58,598 --> 01:05:00,260
Excuse me. I'm here to meet Han Yoon Ah.

1301
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:02,740
Hey. What are you doing here?
