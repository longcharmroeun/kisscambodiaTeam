00:00:32,737 --> 00:00:34,880
Hard!

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,395
Hard!

Doo Shik, Doo Shik!

6
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,048
Doo Shik, sweep. Sweep, sweep!

7
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:41,719
Dong Gu, hard.

8
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,941
- Sweep, sweep!
- Hard, hard...

9
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:46,902
Sweep! Hard!

10
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:49,094
Hard, hard...

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,151
What are you doing?

12
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:54,909
Is it curling this time?

13
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:57,829
I told you to clean.
What crazy thing is it this time?

14
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:59,240
We were cleaning.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,460
It's good to have fun while doing it.

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,531
We said we didn't want to,
but Joon Ki wanted to, really.

17
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,441
What? Joon Ki?

18
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,170
Still, why would you rat him out?
What a petty man you are.

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,409
What? Petty?

20
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,290
Kang Seo Jin, why are you taking
Joon Ki's side anyway?

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,599
When did I take his side? How funny.

22
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,022
What did you say? Petty?

23
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:32,783
I'm going to my script reading.

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,346
Hard!

25
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:40,572
Doo Shik, don't they
seem suspicious to you?

26
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:42,492
What's so suspicious?

27
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:46,105
Are you thinking Seo Jin and Joon Ki
are dating or something?

28
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:50,084
Oh, that's such nonsense.

29
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:51,591
That's true.

30
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:53,510
Joon Ki could do better.

31
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,115
<i>[Covertly and Greatly]</i>
Are you crazy?

32
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,296
I'm seriously so tired of cleaning.

33
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,706
I have to write my web novel too.

34
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,879
<i>Doo Shik, Doo Shik!</i>

35
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,420
What's with all the fuss?

36
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,537
I found something I can be
really good at. Look at this.

37
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:14,479
Soorgio Armhany business plan?

38
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,610
I want to make an internet shopping mall.

39
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,810
Soorgio Armhany Mall.
Shorten it to make it, Su Ah Mall.

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,715
I thought hard about it
and I think I'm suited to fashion.

41
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:27,688
Oh, so you're going to
start a new business.

42
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:29,230
- You have the money?
- Yes.

43
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,513
I got some money from Su Bong
from his fight winnings.

44
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:35,686
Gosh, not just anyone can run a business.

45
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:37,729
Also, how can you do this alone?

46
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,984
I'm not doing it alone.
You're doing it too.

47
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:42,302
Me? When, where, what, why?

48
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:46,443
Do you want to work part-time at a
convenience store or be a mall director?

49
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:49,503
A director? I'm a director?

50
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,032
Then how much are you paying me?

51
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,592
- 3,000.
- 30 million won year?

52
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,626
No, 3,000 won an hour.

53
00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:01,412
Hey, the minimum wage
is 7,530 won an hour.

54
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:03,433
- But, what? 3,000 won an hour?
- All right.

55
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,242
I'll be generous. 3,500 won.
That's enough, right?

56
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:09,742
Director Bong, come with me.
We have a lot to do.

57
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:11,872
I don't want to. I'm not doing it.

58
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:15,022
I don't want to work with you,
you power abuser.

59
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:18,231
I just finished my work here,
so I'll be there soon.

60
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,731
I'll see you soon, Hyun Joon. Okay.

61
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:26,979
I'm interested in Yoon Ah.

62
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,002
I like Yoon Ah.

63
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,501
Are you going to the work on your baking?

64
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,205
Yes, I need to practice something.

65
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:36,149
Really? Did you finish cleaning?

66
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,518
I noticed that the third floor was messy.

67
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,784
Third floor? I vacuumed it
and used the mop.

68
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:45,814
Really? I noticed that the second floor
bathroom tub was very dirty.

69
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:47,043
- Did you clean it?
- Yes.

70
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:51,621
Yes, I cleaned the bathroom
and even waxed it all.

71
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:54,140
Really? Then, oh...

72
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,913
the pockets of the
third floor pool table?

73
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:58,377
You mean the dust in the pockets?

74
00:03:58,377 --> 00:04:03,162
I cleaned it all out
and waxed the balls too.

75
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:06,110
- Then, get going.
- Okay, I will.

76
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:17,473
She's very detailed.
She's a cleaning pro now.

77
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:20,391
She can't continue
hanging around that guy.

78
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:22,961
It's driving me insane.

79
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,732
We're almost home already.

80
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:31,401
What? Are you disappointed, Bacca?

81
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,180
- Bacca?
- Oh, it's my term of affection for you.

82
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,261
You're my girlfriend now and I didn't
think I should call you Chewbacca.

83
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:41,701
I wondered if I should call you
Chew or Bacca.

84
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,860
I thought Bacca was cuter.

85
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:48,781
Or I could shorter Huam-dong's Hairy
and call you Huhair.

86
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:51,228
Well, I don't like any of them.

87
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:53,548
Use any of them except for Huhair.

88
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:55,228
Then Bacca it is.

89
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,706
How long do we have to keep
our relationship a secret?

90
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,723
Can't we tell my brother the truth?

91
00:05:00,723 --> 00:05:04,110
What? Hey, don't you know
Dong Gu's temper?

92
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,079
If we get caught dating,
Dong Gu will beat me to death.

93
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,870
So, let's keep it a secret for now, okay?

94
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,838
Okay.

95
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:16,771
But, are we just going to go in?

96
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,591
Then how else are we going in?

97
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,605
Are we going to tumble or dig our way in?

98
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:22,964
No, not that.

99
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:26,536
What?

100
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,107
- A kiss?
- Yes.

101
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:31,288
But...

102
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,649
- Here?
- Yes.

103
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,608
Gosh, what if someone sees us?

104
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,180
No one is here. Who would see?

105
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:41,769
Okay, okay.

106
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:44,456
Bacca, you're so naughty.

107
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:45,579
Come here.

108
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:54,658
Goodness, what are they doing
in the middle of the street?

109
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:59,704
Oh, I've seen that face many times.

110
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:03,057
Hey, Kang Seo Jin!

111
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,446
It's you, right?

112
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:09,321
What are you doing there?

113
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,466
That's Dong Gu, right? It's Dong Gu.

114
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,908
What should we do?

115
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:16,161
Who are you? Stay put right there.

116
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,471
Darn it.

117
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,918
Hey, you! Where are you going?

118
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,067
- No, no, no!
- What do you mean, no? Move!

119
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,678
Oh, wow!

120
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:34,906
What's with him?

121
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:42,764
That guy... he sure is stubborn.

122
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,065
Wait...

123
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:50,005
I've seen that red coat before.

124
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,461
What? Don't tell me...

125
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,160
You!

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,855
- No.
- You!

127
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,480
Kang Seo Jin, tell the truth.

128
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,492
That guy in the park
was Joon Ki, wasn't it?

129
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,303
I told you it wasn't.

130
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:16,641
What do you mean, no?
They were wearing the same coat.

131
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:21,161
No wonder. You were
shaving regularly at home.

132
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:22,675
It really isn't Joon Ki.

133
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,009
Then who is it? Who is it?

134
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,519
Well... I have a new boyfriend.

135
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,819
What? A boyfriend?

136
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,350
Why did he run away from me?

137
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,947
That's because you screamed
and he got scared.

138
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:41,194
No, there's something suspicious here.

139
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,711
I smell something fishy going on.

140
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,108
Yes, Director. Yes, yes.

141
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:51,637
Yes, I just got home.

142
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,411
Ah, yes. I'll see you tomorrow. Yes.

143
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:59,199
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

144
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,358
Tell me the truth.

145
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:04,158
You were the guy kissing Seo Jin
in the park, right?

146
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,490
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,439
I was practicing my scenes all day
and just got home.

148
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,788
Did you just say Seo Jin
was kissing someone?

149
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:14,218
- Who was it?
- Stop acting.

150
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:18,120
He was wearing the same red coat
as you are now!

151
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,858
Hey, is everyone in a red coat
dating Seo Jin?

152
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:27,983
Also, what do I lack to date a girl with
a bad temper and a thicker beard than me?

153
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,235
Oh, you're going to be like that?

154
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:31,416
That's fine.

155
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,666
Hey, then bring him over.

156
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,498
Bring your boyfriend over here.

157
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:39,159
- What?
- What's wrong? You can't, right?

158
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,306
Because your boyfriend is Joon Ki,
isn't that right?

159
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:45,111
My goodness. Seo Jin, bring him over!

160
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,743
- What?
- Bring him over.

161
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:50,224
Bring him and show Dong Gu
that we are not involved at all.

162
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:52,330
Do that. Yeah.

163
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,812
Okay, I will.

164
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:58,094
Yeah, okay. I'll bring him.

165
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:00,826
Oh, really? Sounds good.

166
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:03,283
We'll see what happens.

167
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,029
Joon Ki... Joon Ki?

168
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:12,321
Here.

169
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:16,971
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

170
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:20,403
Oh! Blood, blood!

171
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:31,663
It's okay. It's okay.

172
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,211
I must've suffered an injury to my organs
when I got hit by the car.

173
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:43,453
At least we didn't get caught by Dong Gu.

174
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:45,394
Do we really have to go this far?

175
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:47,669
Can't we tell him that we're dating?

176
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:50,033
You never know. He might allow it.

177
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:53,638
Hey, if I had younger sister,
I wouldn't let her date me.

178
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:55,548
You think Dong Gu would allow it?

179
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:57,302
Dream on.

180
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:58,676
Gosh.

181
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:01,835
You told me to bring my boyfriend.
What are you planning?

182
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:06,301
Don't worry. I can get
a junior of mine to act the part.

183
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,764
It worked out for the better.

184
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:11,038
Dong Gu won't be suspicious anymore
once he meets your fake boyfriend.

185
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:13,931
We can date more comfortably, right?

186
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:16,724
Well, I suppose so.

187
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:19,770
Don't worry.

188
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,149
Just trust in me, Bacca.

189
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,441
- Okay?
- Yeah.

190
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,164
What are you two doing?

191
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:34,522
Oh, you're so ugly... so ugly!

192
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:37,351
How could someone be so ugly?

193
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:42,905
To grow facial hair on this face too.
Who would ever date you?

194
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:49,110
I don't think I can sleep
after seeing you.

195
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,340
Hold on.

196
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,145
Wh... what?

197
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,135
I'm saying this just in case.

198
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:09,993
If there is something going on
between you and my sister...

199
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:17,186
you will be smelling incense
at your funeral on that day.

200
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:20,679
All right?

201
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,495
Don't worry. That would never happen.

202
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,249
Do you understand?

203
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,197
No matter how much I think about it,
I'm suspicious of them.

204
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:48,839
They kissed that time too.

205
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,019
Well, I guess I'll know today.

206
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:58,308
If the person Seo Jin is dating
is Joon Ki...

207
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,493
Dong Gu, I'll be going
to work on my baking.

208
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:06,855
Again?

209
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,395
There's lots of work here too.
Aren't you going too often?

210
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,706
I did all of my work.

211
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,410
There was lots of laundry piled up.
Did you wash it all?

212
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,591
I washed it all and it's drying now.

213
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:18,442
The guest room on the second floor
had a stain on the pillow cover.

214
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:22,533
I took it off this morning,
washed it, and even sanitized it.

215
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,094
- On the windows of the third floor--
- The curtains?

216
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:28,004
I washed them and
hung them up to dry too.

217
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:32,259
Really? Then how about on the roof,
the third railing--

218
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,561
The store sign?

219
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:37,373
I washed that, ironed it,
and put it back up.

220
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:38,856
- Then, get going.
- Okay.

221
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,573
I'll be going now.

222
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:44,552
She's so detailed now.

223
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:48,581
She's extremely efficient.
When did she do all of that?

224
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:53,566
This is bothering me so much.
Song Hyun Joon...

225
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,407
Look at this.

226
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:09,322
Director Bong!

227
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:14,125
You scared me. What are you doing?

228
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,827
The president didn't get any sleep
shopping at Dongdaemun Market all night.

229
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:19,231
Yet, you sleep during work hours?

230
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,525
Hey, I couldn't sleep for days
making this homepage.

231
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,674
Whatever. Do we have any orders?

232
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:28,044
The only people who know this domain
address are you and me.

233
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:30,455
So, who would come and order?

234
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:33,210
Gosh, then what do we do?

235
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,979
Is there a way to promote it?

236
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:37,923
Broadcasting is the most
straightforward way.

237
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:40,089
That's not so easy though.

238
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,192
Broadcasting.

239
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,458
Broadcasting, you say...

240
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:49,217
Hello, this is part two of
Seo Yuri's "See You at Noon."

241
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:53,172
This is when we have the very popular
segment of callers singing for us.

242
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:56,456
<i>Let's connect with our first caller.</i>

243
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:57,934
<i>Hello?</i>

244
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,260
Yes, hello!

245
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,778
Yes, hello. Can you introduce yourself?

246
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:10,429
<i>Hello, I am Bong Doo Shik, director of
internet shopping mall, Soorgio Armhany.</i>

247
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,341
<i>Ah, yes, Director Bong.</i>

248
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:16,110
You're actually not supposed to say
your shopping mall's name on air.

249
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,990
Oh, really? I'm sorry.

250
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,528
<i>We'll let it go since it was one mistake.</i>

251
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,639
Director Bong, which song
will you be singing for us?

252
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,998
I will be singing Lim Jae Bum's
"Confession."

253
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:30,506
<i>Oh, "Confession." That's a hard one.</i>

254
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:32,844
Then let's hear your singing.

255
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:41,195
<i>What am I to do?</i>

256
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:47,403
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

257
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:55,351
<i>I have dared to feel for that woman.</i>

258
00:14:55,351 --> 00:15:01,326
<i>And I love her.</i>

259
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:06,639
<i>Quietly, I Su Ah...</i>

260
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:12,633
<i>I also do not Su Ah.</i>

261
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:17,073
<i>Soorgio Armhany...</i>

262
00:15:17,073 --> 00:15:21,594
<i>Shopping Mall.</i>

263
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:23,365
<i>Su Ah--</i>

264
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:26,025
<i>Oh, we were suddenly disconnected.</i>

265
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,618
<i>I apologize to our listeners for that.</i>

266
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:33,546
<i>We'll move on to our next caller. Hello?</i>

267
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:35,297
Yes, hello.

268
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:38,097
<i>Yes, hello.
Would you like to introduce yourself?</i>

269
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:41,298
My name is Min Su Ah
and I live in Huam-dong.

270
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:43,221
Which song will you be singing for us?

271
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:45,971
I will be singing G-Dragon's "Crooked."

272
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:48,143
Oh, GD's "Crooked."

273
00:15:48,143 --> 00:15:50,870
Let's go directly to the song.

274
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:56,634
<i>There is nothing that is forever.</i>

275
00:15:56,634 --> 00:16:00,121
<i>In the end, you've changed.</i>

276
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:02,125
<i>- There is no reason.
- Su Ah.</i>

277
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,926
<i>- There is no sincerity.
- Su Ah.</i>

278
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:07,466
<i>Shopping Mall, Soorgio Armhany.</i>

279
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,048
<i>- Shopping Mall, Soorgio Armhany.
- Shopping Mall, Soorgio Armhany.</i>

280
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:12,842
<i>Shopping Mall...</i>

281
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:14,615
Geez, that woman...

282
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:18,359
She shows no manners to her listeners.

283
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,684
Wouldn't you hang up
if someone pulled this stunt on you?

284
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:22,796
What can we do?
We have to try this.

285
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:25,049
- We were awesome, right?
- Yes.

286
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,812
You were great.

287
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:39,600
This is good.

288
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,346
- Really?
- Yes, it's really good.

289
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:44,823
Oh, what a relief.

290
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:48,125
Honestly, I'm most confident
about muffins.

291
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:52,616
I want to open a store later,
so I made up a name using Sol's name.

292
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:55,207
Really? What is it?

293
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:59,456
<i>Sol, Sol, Fresh Sol's Muffins.</i>

294
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:04,067
Oh, yes. What a unique name.

295
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:06,711
Is this the recipe?

296
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:10,592
Yes, I developed it myself.

297
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:18,800
So, this is your boyfriend?

298
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,825
- Yes, I told you.
- You, be quiet.

299
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,395
Are you really Seo Jin's boyfriend?

300
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,481
Hi, hi...

301
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,473
Yes, I enjoy wearing red coats.

302
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:35,096
I was kissing Seo Jin
near the house when you...

303
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,963
yelled just like that.

304
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:41,799
Without thinking about it, I ran away.

305
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,503
I am Seo Jin's boyfriend, Kang Hong Seok.

306
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:51,963
Hong Seok is a musical actor,
so he has very big gestures.

307
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:54,439
He is very expressive.

308
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,662
Yeah, he is.

309
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:58,625
How did you meet Seo Jin?

310
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,528
What's with the lights?

311
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:15,502
The first time we met
was at a theater show.

312
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:19,237
Seo Jin opened the door to the theater
for a story she was doing.

313
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:22,742
Tap... tap.

314
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:24,527
Tap... I heard the sound.

315
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:27,073
Suddenly my heart went, thud.

316
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,733
Thud... thud.

317
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,211
It started to race.

318
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:35,756
I started to hear a song in my ear
that would tell me our fate.

319
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:41,726
<i>Here in this moment, my everything.</i>

320
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:47,394
<i>Putting my body and soul on the line.</i>

321
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:52,690
<i>I will throw it and offer it.</i>

322
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,522
<i>For what I desperately sought...</i>

323
00:18:55,522 --> 00:19:06,800
<i>For the sake of my destiny, Kang Seo Jin!</i>

324
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,724
By the way,
where's the bathroom here?

325
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:17,971
What? The bath... bathroom?

326
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:20,103
Over... over there.

327
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:23,324
Ah... over there.

328
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,289
One moment, please.

329
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,993
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

330
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:30,823
Tap, tap.

331
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:34,474
See? I told you I wasn't
involved with Seo Jin.

332
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:38,406
He is a bit strange.

333
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:42,198
It's 100 times better
than dating Joon Ki.

334
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:43,518
What, man?

335
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,487
What's so wrong with me?

336
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:47,657
Just be relieved it's not you.

337
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:52,868
If Seo Jin were dating you,
that is the day that...

338
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:57,775
you would be smelling incense
at your funeral.

339
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,113
All right.

340
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:02,980
Stop saying that.
You sound like the Grim Reaper.

341
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:09,701
You expect me to do this?
Do I really have to?

342
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:13,671
What can we do?
We have to promote the shopping mall.

343
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,550
What is it? Why is it so noisy?

344
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,637
Dong Gu.

345
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:21,259
What is this? What are you guys doing?

346
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:23,650
<i>[BJ Soorgio BJ Armhany Shaving and Bones]
An internet broadcast.</i>

347
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,974
<i>We have to promote our mall.</i>

348
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,214
Oh, I see.

349
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:30,284
- What's that on your face?
- Hm?

350
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:31,788
Oh, this?

351
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:35,105
It was super popular when Seo Jin
went on and shaved before.

352
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:38,584
I put on some makeup
to do a shaving broadcast.

353
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:42,275
Oh, really?

354
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,133
What kind of bones are these?
Dinosaur bones?

355
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:49,272
She's telling me to do
the bone eating that Joon Ki did.

356
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:53,315
Not just any bones,
but strong cow leg bones.

357
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:55,720
Joon Ki already did pig hock bones.

358
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,365
You have to come on strong
for people to watch.

359
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,808
Seriously.

360
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:03,868
<i>Hey, there are people watching.</i>

361
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:05,867
<i>Start, Doo Shik.</i>

362
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:09,131
<i>Hello to Nouveau Gangnam!</i>

363
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:12,743
<i>I am the beauty of the shaving broadcast.</i>

364
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:15,814
BJ Soorgio.

365
00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:21,586
Hello, I'm the pretty boy
of bone eating, Armhany.

366
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:24,704
With that, we'll be eating bones

367
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:28,036
<i>as well as doing a shaving
broadcast today.</i>

368
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,693
First, I will put on this shaving cream.

369
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:38,241
What are you doing?
Hurry up and eat it.

370
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,192
Doo Shik...

371
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:47,127
It's your first shoot.
Is it going well?

372
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:50,107
I don't know. I am working hard.

373
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:53,378
I'm also worried and nervous.

374
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,019
Stay strong. I know you'll do well.

375
00:21:56,019 --> 00:22:00,000
You're the only one
who thinks of me, Bacca.

376
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,498
You're thankful, right?

377
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:04,469
- Shouldn't you reward me, then?
- Reward you?

378
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:07,428
- With what?
- Do you really not know?

379
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:10,509
What?

380
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:12,778
- Again?
- Yes.

381
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:15,036
What if we get caught by Dong Gu again?

382
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:16,363
I doubt it.

383
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:20,420
We should be careful.
Didn't you hear what Dong Gu said?

384
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,095
"You will be smelling incense
at your funeral."

385
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:30,794
I still get goosebumps on my back
when I think about that.

386
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:32,952
But still...

387
00:22:35,498 --> 00:22:37,779
All right. Okay.

388
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:40,791
You naughty little Bacca.

389
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,044
You put your lips there.
Put them right there.

390
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:46,246
Put them there. All right.

391
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:48,444
I'm going to use my technique.

392
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:55,266
What is that? Hm.

393
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:58,196
Hey! Kang Seo Jin!

394
00:22:58,196 --> 00:23:00,627
What is that? It's Dong Gu, right?

395
00:23:00,627 --> 00:23:01,857
What do we do?

396
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:05,659
Kang Seo Jin, who is it? Who is it?

397
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:08,103
What? What was that?

398
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:10,002
What is he doing?

399
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:14,471
By the way... Kang Seo Jin.

400
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,983
- You!
- No, it's not that.

401
00:23:16,983 --> 00:23:19,638
What do you mean, no?

402
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:21,992
Follow me. Follow me.

403
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:27,153
Kang Seo Jin,
Hong Seok says he's at the theater.

404
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:29,000
Who was that guy?

405
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:30,722
Wait.

406
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:34,862
Now that I think about it,
he looked like Joon Ki from the back.

407
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:38,112
What are you talking about?
It isn't Joon Ki.

408
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,694
Then, who is it?

409
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:42,535
Why was he kissing you, huh?

410
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:44,046
Well...

411
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:45,942
he is my boyfriend.

412
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:48,049
What? Boyfriend?

413
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:49,864
What about Hong Seok?

414
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:53,012
Are you dating two guys?

415
00:23:53,971 --> 00:23:57,829
Yes, I met him today
when I was doing a story.

416
00:23:57,829 --> 00:23:59,371
I liked him so much.

417
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,853
You kissed a guy you met today?

418
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:03,874
I'm feeling a lot of passion lately.

419
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:05,230
It's desire.

420
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,154
You expect me to believe that?

421
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,648
Yes, Director. Yes.

422
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:13,252
Thank you for driving me home.

423
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,892
Get home safely. Yes.

424
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,107
Look at this.

425
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:20,752
You look the same as that guy
from the back.

426
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:23,910
- What are you doing?
- Don't try to get out of it.

427
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,371
You were the one kissing Seo Jin
in the park, right?

428
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:28,606
What are you talking about?

429
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:31,836
I just got in after practicing lines.

430
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:35,842
Are you saying Seo Jin
was kissing someone again?

431
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:39,305
You're just crazy
about kissing, aren't you?

432
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:42,486
So, you're saying that wasn't you?

433
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:46,178
Fine, then bring your boyfriend over.

434
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:47,888
- Bring him.
- Right now!

435
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,609
What?

436
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:51,544
- Now?
- Why are you alarmed, Joon Ki?

437
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:54,211
- Why are you scared, huh?
- I'm not.

438
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:56,527
Seo Jin, bring him.

439
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:59,720
- What?
- Bring him over. You can do it.

440
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,660
Trust me and bring him over.

441
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,820
And show Dong Gu
that we are not involved.

442
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,431
Yes, show me. Please show me!

443
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:09,903
Call him!

444
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:12,484
What are you doing?
I have to see him today!

445
00:25:12,484 --> 00:25:14,777
- Bring him over here!
- Right now!

446
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:16,623
Okay...

447
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:24,250
Why are you dressed that way?

448
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,705
Ah, I was filming a historical drama.

449
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:30,387
I suddenly received a call for a job.

450
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:31,750
A job?

451
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,680
Oh, it's not that.

452
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,267
I suddenly received a call
from my girlfriend, Bang Seo Jin.

453
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:40,549
Bang Seo Jin?

454
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:41,771
<i>- Kang.
- Kang.</i>

455
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:44,040
- Is that wrong?
- What?

456
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,739
Honestly, we started dating so suddenly.

457
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:51,030
I'm not so sure about her name.

458
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,067
Yeah, that could happen.

459
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:55,871
I didn't know even after three months.

460
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:57,426
- Really?
- Anyway...

461
00:25:57,426 --> 00:26:00,688
I really am Seo Jin's boyfriend.

462
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:04,855
Sorry, but may I go
if you're done confirming?

463
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,517
I'm supposed to go drink poison
in 30 minutes.

464
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:10,545
Oh, really? Then get going.

465
00:26:10,545 --> 00:26:11,980
Goodbye.

466
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:19,346
See, I told you. It isn't me!

467
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:24,685
Yeah, he's strange too.

468
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:28,165
It's better than her dating you.

469
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:31,507
Still, you're dating two guys
and kissing that one on the first day?

470
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,186
Seo Jin, aren't you
dating around too much?

471
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:39,329
Sorry, I didn't know I was
dating around so much either.

472
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,463
Gosh.

473
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:43,723
I'm worried about you.

474
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,251
It's still at zero visitors.

475
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:54,163
We have so many clothes.
This is a big problem. Ouch!

476
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:56,551
Oh, my molars.

477
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,589
Min Su Ah, that girl.

478
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:02,555
Director Bong, follow me.

479
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:03,778
Follow you where?

480
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:06,230
We can't just sit and wait.

481
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,577
We need to put our boots
to the ground. Come on.

482
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:11,070
- Where are we going now?
- I said, follow me.

483
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,103
What are you going to do now, Su Ah?

484
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:18,779
- Hello, this is Soorgio Armhany.
- Hello, it's an internet shopping mall.

485
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:22,611
Hello, it's a new internet shopping mall,
Soorgio Armhany.

486
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:24,487
Please just try searching it.

487
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:32,826
Su Ah, let's give up now.

488
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:35,210
This isn't going to promote anything.

489
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,640
Who promotes an
internet shopping site with fliers?

490
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,417
I have no other method.
I have to try something.

491
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:44,440
You can go if you want.
I'm going to hand all of these out.

492
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,525
Hey, hey.

493
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:49,318
It's a new internet shopping mall,
Soorgio Armhany.

494
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:12,286
That's why I said we should stop.

495
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:14,738
Let's go now, okay?

496
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,108
Hey, Min Su Ah.

497
00:28:18,108 --> 00:28:19,529
Are you crying?

498
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:21,490
Doo Shik.

499
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,846
Why am I always this way?

500
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:28,220
Why can't I do anything properly?

501
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:32,968
I worked really hard this time.

502
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:37,558
I wanted to do well.

503
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:43,871
Get up.

504
00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:47,291
No, I'm going to stay longer.
You go home first.

505
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,932
I said get up. I'm hungry.

506
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:53,821
Hey, how can you say you're hungry
in this situation?

507
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:56,761
I have to eat something
to hand out more fliers.

508
00:28:56,761 --> 00:28:58,165
- What?
- Also...

509
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:02,153
how can the director leave when
the president is here like this?

510
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:03,955
So, get up.

511
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:21,431
Here. Have this.

512
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:23,104
No, I don't have an appetite.

513
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:26,439
Don't be like that
and have a sip. Hurry.

514
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:40,022
Don't move. Don't move an inch!

515
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:41,680
Everyone, get on the floor now!

516
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,971
Get on the floor
if you don't want to die.

517
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:47,115
- Is that a gun?
- Huh?

518
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:49,736
It's a gun, a gun.

519
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:51,190
What's going on suddenly?

520
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,329
Hey, you! Get on the floor now!

521
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:55,571
Yes.

522
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,363
Hyun Joon.

523
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:01,998
- You're here?
- Yes.

524
00:30:01,998 --> 00:30:03,678
Why did you ask to see me?

525
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:07,015
Oh, I had something to show you.

526
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,963
<i>[Sol, Sol, Fresh Sol's Muffins]</i>

527
00:30:10,404 --> 00:30:12,142
What is this?

528
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,221
I am a businessman, after all.

529
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:17,226
I felt that your muffin
could be very competitive.

530
00:30:17,226 --> 00:30:19,372
So, I made it a product.
What do you think?

531
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:20,449
Really?

532
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:22,424
It's your recipe,
exactly as you wrote it.

533
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:25,675
My store will take care
of the production and sales.

534
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:29,953
However, the profit will be shared 50:50.
Do you have any objections?

535
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,289
No, I don't.

536
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,290
Thank you so much.

537
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,809
Thank you, Hyun Joon.

538
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:39,300
Let's work well together,
Patisseur Han Yoon Ah.

539
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:48,472
Park Goo Chul, it's not too late.

540
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,990
<i>Put your weapon down now
and come on out.</i>

541
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,627
Don't try anything!

542
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:55,586
Get lost if you want to
save the hostages!

543
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:58,817
How long do we have to stay like this?

544
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:03,700
What is this?
Even the TV stations are here.

545
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,941
Yeah, there are lots of cameras.

546
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:09,228
Wait now.

547
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:13,516
Doo Shik, aren't these things
usually aired live?

548
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:15,250
Yes, why?

549
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,461
It's our chance to promote.

550
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,474
It's being aired live on TV.

551
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,950
So, you want to
promote the shopping mall?

552
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,936
Are you crazy?

553
00:31:23,936 --> 00:31:26,306
You stay put. I'll take care of it.

554
00:31:26,306 --> 00:31:27,685
Don't do it. Just don't.

555
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,711
Don't do it. You'll get shot.
Don't do anything.

556
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:32,200
Don't do anything.

557
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,390
Stop it. Don't do it.

558
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,744
What's going on there? What is it?

559
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:48,105
Hey, what are you doing?

560
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:52,595
Hey, sir. Can I just stand here?

561
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:56,973
I'm already a hostage and it's the same
whether I stand or sit on the ground.

562
00:31:56,973 --> 00:31:58,464
- Psycho.
- What?

563
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,374
Are you crazy? Get on the ground.

564
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:02,653
Hurry up and do it.

565
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:04,487
I have my reasons too.

566
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:09,124
I already don't want to live.
Do you want to die here?

567
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,037
You're not the only one
with troubles in your life.

568
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,704
What?

569
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,226
I don't know how hard your life is.

570
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:24,464
My life is pretty bad too.

571
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:28,886
I was conned by a man I dated,
so I lost all of my money.

572
00:32:28,886 --> 00:32:30,256
As if that wasn't enough.

573
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:34,208
I'm living for free at my ex-boyfriend's,
whom I dumped for being unsuccessful.

574
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,449
Really?

575
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:40,157
On top of that,
my ex-boyfriend likes someone new now.

576
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:43,537
He even gets dating advice from me.

577
00:32:43,537 --> 00:32:45,746
I feel so pathetic
whenever I have to hear that stuff.

578
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:47,747
He's a jerk.

579
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:53,726
Now, the internet shopping mall that was
my last hope is about to go under.

580
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:57,695
So, please just let me stand here.

581
00:32:57,695 --> 00:33:02,816
Please, sir?

582
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:06,359
Why... why are you crying?

583
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,227
Everyone from the back is staring.
Stop crying.

584
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:11,609
These two are so alike.

585
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:31,596
Good thing I learned that from Su Bong.

586
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:35,563
Bacca, what is it?
What's wrong, Bacca?

587
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:36,779
Do you really not know?

588
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,623
I've become some easy woman
because of you.

589
00:33:38,623 --> 00:33:41,211
We had no choice because of Dong Gu.

590
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:44,063
Then how long are we doing this?
Will we keep it up forever?

591
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,442
Don't you know Dong Gu's personality?

592
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:48,222
Dong Gu will beat me to death
if we get caught.

593
00:33:48,222 --> 00:33:50,074
What kind of man is such a coward?

594
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:51,708
- You're that scared of Dong Gu?
- Yes.

595
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,683
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

596
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:56,189
I don't want to smell incense.

597
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:59,894
Forget it, then. Let's just break up.

598
00:33:59,894 --> 00:34:03,095
Hey. What do you mean, break up?

599
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:05,050
Bacca, why are you being that way?

600
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,790
Hey, Seo Jin!

601
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,262
Forget it. Let me go.

602
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:11,579
- No. I won't and I can't.
- Let me go.

603
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:14,940
- Seo Jin.
- Hey, Kang Seo Jin!

604
00:34:15,717 --> 00:34:18,760
Hey, that's Dong Gu, isn't it?

605
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,103
Why again?

606
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:21,737
Let's just tell him the truth, okay?

607
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:23,248
No, I'll die.

608
00:34:23,248 --> 00:34:25,077
Are you going to be like this
until the end?

609
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:28,128
Hey, don't move at all
and stand right there.

610
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:29,976
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

611
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:40,737
What's with that guy?
Is he a man or a cheetah?

612
00:34:40,737 --> 00:34:43,639
Kang Seo Jin, who is that guy?

613
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,485
I don't know either!

614
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,556
Look at you.

615
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:49,219
What did you do right
that you're yelling?

616
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,251
Hey, Kang Seo Jin!

617
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:54,360
<i>A regular citizen took down a man
armed with a gun, bare-handed.</i>

618
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,659
<i>We will interview her soon.</i>

619
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:59,148
Hello.

620
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:04,041
Hello, I have an internet shopping mall,
Soorgio Armhany.

621
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,202
Shortened, it is called Su Ah Mall.
I am the president, Min Su Ah.

622
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:10,822
It wouldn't have been easy
to overpower the armed robber.

623
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:12,023
Of course, not.

624
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:15,599
However, the foundation of my internet
shopping mall, Soorgio Armhany

625
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,682
is the realization of a just society.

626
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:22,822
Best quality and reasonable prices
as well as quick delivery.

627
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:26,646
Soorgio Armhany always
dreams of a just society.

628
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,307
We are here by your side.

629
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:30,141
W-W-W dot...

630
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:32,137
Hey, be honest.

631
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:34,449
Who was the guy you were hugging?

632
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:35,668
I said I don't know.

633
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:38,588
Hey! Does it make sense to be
hugging someone you don't know?

634
00:35:38,588 --> 00:35:42,431
I saw him on the street and hugged him.
Don't you know I get around?

635
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,228
Why are you getting angry?

636
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:49,007
I was just wondering
if you were dating Joon Ki.

637
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:51,657
Do you hate Joon Ki that much?

638
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:54,139
What? Hey.

639
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:57,757
Why would I hate Joon Ki?
I like Joon Ki.

640
00:35:57,757 --> 00:36:01,670
He is a bit childish,
but he has a kind heart.

641
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,467
He can be very thoughtful too.

642
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:08,695
I'm just saying that I can't
accept him as a brother-in-law.

643
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:10,188
Really?

644
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:14,360
I'm asking you this hypothetically.

645
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,972
What would you do if I dated Joon Ki?

646
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:18,610
Would you hit him?

647
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,719
Are you crazy? How could I hit him?

648
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:25,041
- If that were to happen...
- Yes.

649
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,710
I wouldn't leave you be, Seo Jin.

650
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,077
Me? What would you do?

651
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:37,063
There's a temple deep in the mountains
of Gangwon-do that I know of.

652
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:41,733
The scenery and water are nice
and there's no one around.

653
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:46,340
- And?
- Rather than see you date Joon Ki...

654
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,030
I would shave your head bald
until you had nothing left.

655
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,840
Then turn you into a monk.

656
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,476
A monk?

657
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:04,043
I wouldn't give you your razor either.

658
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,860
You know I don't joke
about these things, right?

659
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,735
Yes, I know that very well.

660
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:27,900
Hey, Kang Dong Gu.

661
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,568
What's with him?
Why did he drink so much?

662
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:34,358
Hey, you bad temper.

663
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:38,045
I have something to confess to you today.

664
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,353
A confession? What is it?

665
00:37:45,844 --> 00:37:46,994
What is it?

666
00:37:46,994 --> 00:37:51,882
I'll be a man and
tell you everything, Dong Gu.

667
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,612
Honestly...

668
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:58,490
Seo Jin...

669
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:10,773
Kang Seo Jin, what are you doing?

670
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:12,701
He... he was being noisy.

671
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:15,867
He should go up and sleep quietly
if he's drunk, not be noisy out here.

672
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:19,083
I don't like anything about him.

673
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:25,844
Even if she doesn't like Joon Ki,
there's no need to hate him this much.

674
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:30,474
Wow, I was suspicious for no reason.

675
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,657
Joon Ki, are you okay?

676
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:34,005
Joon Ki?

677
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:38,996
Bacca, did anything happen
after I came back from drinking?

678
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:42,106
I do remember coming home.

679
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:44,306
Then I blacked out.

680
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:48,846
Oh, that's because...
you fell after drinking.

681
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,210
I did?

682
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,722
Anyway, I'm sorry, Seo Jin.

683
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:58,572
Even if I get beaten to death,
I'll make sure to tell Dong Gu today.

684
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:02,523
Huh? No, no. Don't do it.

685
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:05,161
- Why?
- I thought about it.

686
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:07,391
I think it's best to keep it secret.

687
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:11,856
So, let's keep it a secret
and continue to do so.

688
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:12,974
Okay?

689
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,505
Yeah, sure.

690
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:17,626
I'll go to my shoot, then.

691
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:20,518
Already? I thought it was in the
afternoon. Why are you going now?

692
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:22,010
I have to go early and practice.

693
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,860
I'm filming today with Min Ki Hyung.

694
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,228
Really? You must be nervous.

695
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:30,039
I think my heart's going to explode.

696
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,313
Then should I recharge your energy
to give you strength?

697
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:37,565
Recharge? How?

698
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:43,922
How was that? Do you feel recharged?

699
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:49,659
Yeah, I feel so full of energy.
I can't control it.

700
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,735
What are you doing?
What if Dong Gu sees us?

701
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:58,958
Who cares if he does?

702
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:09,286
I have another order.

703
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:12,860
Wow, looks like you're
getting some orders now.

704
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,740
Yeah, it must be the promotion.

705
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,353
You know this is all thanks to me,
Director Bong.

706
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,422
Hey, I don't see Yoon Ah.

707
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:23,282
Yeah, she said she was
going to the bakery.

708
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:25,143
What? This early?

709
00:40:25,143 --> 00:40:28,853
Hyun Joon made a spot for her
in his bakery to sell her muffins.

710
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:31,692
They're sharing profits on it too.

711
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:34,630
Oh, really.

712
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,396
Director Bong,
what have you been reading?

713
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,483
- Is it fun?
- Yes, it's really fun.

714
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:40,579
What's it about?

715
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:45,606
This man pretends to be terminally ill
in order to stay with the woman he loves.

716
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:48,228
His love is very tragic.

717
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:52,318
What? Pretends to be terminal to keep
the woman he loves near him?

718
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:54,251
That's a lie.

719
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,338
That's not tragic. It's cowardly.

720
00:40:57,338 --> 00:40:59,849
- What do you mean?
- It's cowardly.

721
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:03,619
Like someone who gives a spot
to sell bread in a bakery.

722
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,449
Is that something a man should do?
A small person might do that.

723
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:07,876
Isn't that right?

724
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:11,574
That jerk.

725
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,139
<i>[Real Man]</i>

726
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:23,809
Hello.

727
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:26,260
- Hello!
- Hello, hello.

728
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,010
You're here, Joon Ki.

729
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,407
You know Min Ki Hyung, right?
Say hello.

730
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,402
Sir, hello.

731
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,179
I'm honored to meet you.

732
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:37,639
I'm Lee Joon Ki,
playing the role of Song Joon Seok.

733
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:41,702
Oh, you're playing Dong Doon Deok?

734
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:45,336
- Pardon?
- Are you Dong Doon Deok?

735
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:48,894
Yes, I am.

736
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:53,128
You have a good face.
Let's do well today.

737
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:59,425
Joon Ki, why are you laughing?

738
00:41:59,425 --> 00:42:02,601
It's just his pronunciation.

739
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:05,702
Ah, he recently had tongue surgery.

740
00:42:05,702 --> 00:42:08,164
He can't pronounce certain characters.

741
00:42:08,164 --> 00:42:10,369
He'll be better soon. Don't worry.

742
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,769
I see.

743
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:14,411
And... cue.

744
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:18,871
Director, I cannot follow those orders.

745
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:21,713
I will air this news.

746
00:42:21,713 --> 00:42:22,802
What did you say?

747
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:25,864
Even I lose my job as anchor, no...

748
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:30,105
even if I die, I will do this story.

749
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:31,510
Do you understand?

750
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,793
Are you really going to be like this,
Dong Doon Deok?

751
00:42:36,284 --> 00:42:39,047
Do you know what I've done for you,
Dong Doon Deok?

752
00:42:40,885 --> 00:42:42,422
Cut.

753
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:45,318
Joon Ki, why do you keep
curling your lips?

754
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:51,670
Oh, I'm sorry. My lips are dry.

755
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,871
Sir, I'm sorry.

756
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:55,471
No, that can happen when you're nervous.

757
00:42:55,471 --> 00:42:56,820
Let's keep going.

758
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,056
- We'll go from your line, sir.
- Okay.

759
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,467
And... cue!

760
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:06,704
Do you know what I've done for you,
Dong Doon Deok?

761
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:12,487
- Why do you keep laughing?
- Pardon me?

762
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:16,498
Why do you keep laughing?
Is my acting funny?

763
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:19,543
- No. No, it's not that.
- Never mind.

764
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:23,259
Director Kim, let's do it a bit later.

765
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:28,315
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

766
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,454
- Why do keep laughing, Joon Ki?
- I'm sorry.

767
00:43:31,454 --> 00:43:33,835
I can't control it
because of his pronunciation.

768
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:36,300
Still, you can't laugh when he's acting.

769
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,414
- Be careful, okay?
- I'm sorry.

770
00:43:40,414 --> 00:43:42,090
Sir...

771
00:43:43,628 --> 00:43:47,692
I'm going crazy here...
Dong Doon Deok.

772
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,172
Why do I keep laughing?

773
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:53,202
Dong Doon Deok, Dong Doon Deok...

774
00:43:53,202 --> 00:43:54,985
I must be insane.

775
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:59,121
Looks like things are coming together.
How did yesterday's location hunting go?

776
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:02,278
- I'm looking into it.
- <i>A spot for Yoon Ah to sell?</i>

777
00:44:02,278 --> 00:44:06,119
<i>[Bread, bread, bread, bread...]
He's going to be petty and use bread.</i>

778
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,797
<i>That bastard.</i>

779
00:44:08,797 --> 00:44:12,398
You know when Shin Hyun Joon enters
the hotel party in Dubai?

780
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:15,597
Where should he hide the air gun?

781
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:17,436
- I thought about it.
- Yes.

782
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:19,286
There is a band at a party.

783
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:22,445
So, how about he hides it
in an instrument case?

784
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:25,592
Hey, they already did that in
"Mission Impossible."

785
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:29,052
Not something like that,
but something fresh.

786
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,500
Hey, there he goes again. Look.

787
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,981
He must have an idea again.

788
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:38,297
Dong Gu. Dong Gu, do you have something?

789
00:44:38,297 --> 00:44:39,947
Bread!

790
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:42,918
Bread? What about it? What bread?

791
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:44,259
Bread that you eat?

792
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:48,688
So, hide the air gun
in bread that you eat?

793
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:50,228
It's very fresh.

794
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:53,447
No way. How can you hide
that big thing inside bread?

795
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:55,929
You need to bake long bread.

796
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:57,958
It's a party, so there's food.

797
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:00,307
It's natural like flowing water.

798
00:45:00,307 --> 00:45:03,298
Kang Dong Gu, you got another one.

799
00:45:03,298 --> 00:45:06,271
Kang Dong Gu,
you could direct your own film soon.

800
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:08,009
Good. It's great.

801
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,335
Thank you.

802
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:15,289
You said it before I could again.
I was thinking of bread too.

803
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:18,210
- Give it a rest.
- What?

804
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,121
Sorry.

805
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:35,827
Oh, what brings you by, Dong Gu?

806
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:37,989
You must be here to see Yoon Ah.

807
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:41,835
No, I came to investigate
for movie props.

808
00:45:41,835 --> 00:45:43,789
Where is Yoon Ah anyway?

809
00:45:44,806 --> 00:45:47,077
She's in the bakery. Should I get her?

810
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,826
No, it's okay.

811
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:52,427
I heard that you gave
Yoon Ah a vendor spot.

812
00:45:52,427 --> 00:45:54,748
Yes, here.

813
00:45:56,248 --> 00:45:58,673
Oh, it's this.

814
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:02,862
I didn't see you that way,
but you're much pettier than I thought.

815
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:04,242
What do you mean, pettier?

816
00:46:04,242 --> 00:46:08,494
You're buying Yoon Ah's goodwill
using this, isn't that right?

817
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:12,213
A man being petty using bread.

818
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:14,463
- What?
- Never mind that.

819
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:17,583
Do you have bread here
that could hold an air gun?

820
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:19,331
Why would you put an air gun in bread?

821
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,849
It is needed for the movie.

822
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:24,309
I can't talk to you
if you don't know about movies.

823
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:28,612
Is it possible to produce bread
for an air gun to fit inside of?

824
00:46:28,612 --> 00:46:31,496
- Like a loaf of bread?
- Yes, I can make it.

825
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:33,827
Then please make me about 20.

826
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:37,047
About the size of an air gun, okay?

827
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,231
Sure.

828
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:41,525
Oh, what are you doing here, Dong Gu?

829
00:46:41,525 --> 00:46:45,527
I came here to inquire
about some movie props.

830
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:48,467
- I'll get going now.
- Okay.

831
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:50,315
Oh, Hyun Joo.

832
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:54,155
Live your life like a man. Like a man.

833
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:05,416
How cowardly for a man.

834
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:07,115
I could never live like that.

835
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,726
He is so shameless.

836
00:47:13,661 --> 00:47:15,706
My legs!

837
00:47:17,398 --> 00:47:19,175
Dong Gu!

838
00:47:19,175 --> 00:47:20,338
Are you okay, Dong Gu?

839
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:21,927
Dong Gu, hold on a little bit.

840
00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:23,789
Oh, don't touch me!

841
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:26,000
- Don't touch me!
- Hold on a little bit.

842
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,219
Are you okay?

843
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,478
Ambulance, ambulance!

844
00:47:36,331 --> 00:47:39,672
- You're home, Joon Ki?
- Yeah.

845
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:42,206
Why are you so down?

846
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:43,878
Did something happen?

847
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:46,036
I almost got fired.

848
00:47:46,036 --> 00:47:48,085
What? Why?

849
00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:51,025
Min Ki Hyung hurt his tongue.

850
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:53,713
He couldn't pronounce things well.

851
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:58,588
- Yes.
- My role's name is Song Joon Seok.

852
00:47:58,588 --> 00:47:59,721
And?

853
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:02,300
Every time he says my name...

854
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,840
"Dong Doon Deok, Dong Doon Deok."
That's what he says.

855
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,391
I burst out laughing
and got into trouble.

856
00:48:08,391 --> 00:48:11,309
What? "Dong Doon Deok, Dong Doon Deok"?

857
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:13,101
Yes.

858
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:18,141
Yes, with that serious face,
"Dong Doon Deok, Dong Doon Deok."

859
00:48:18,141 --> 00:48:20,661
I couldn't stop my laughter.

860
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:23,731
I can't stop laughing
once I get started either.

861
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:27,695
Ah, I have to re-shoot with him tomorrow.

862
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:30,052
What am I to do?

863
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,963
- Oh.
- Dong Gu.

864
00:48:38,188 --> 00:48:40,585
Dong Gu, what happened
and what's with the wheelchair?

865
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,099
Well, Dong Gu got hurt.

866
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:45,197
How did he get hurt?

867
00:48:45,197 --> 00:48:47,940
It's nothing, so don't cause a fuss.

868
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,789
Yoon Ah, please take me to my room.

869
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:52,172
Yes.

870
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:58,498
This is a big problem.

871
00:48:58,498 --> 00:49:00,635
Both your legs are hurt,
so what will you do?

872
00:49:00,635 --> 00:49:02,047
He can't even move.

873
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:05,059
Yeah, we can handle it today.

874
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:07,440
But everyone has to go out
for work tomorrow.

875
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,077
Don't worry. I'll stay with Dong Gu.

876
00:49:10,077 --> 00:49:12,356
What about the academy and the bakery?

877
00:49:12,356 --> 00:49:14,447
I can miss some classes.

878
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:17,847
I'll ask Hyun Joon to cover the bakery.

879
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:22,248
Dong Gu, tell me
if you need anything, okay?

880
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:24,021
Yes.

881
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:27,318
Yoon Ah, I just want to rest now.

882
00:49:30,197 --> 00:49:31,713
Let's go.

883
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,842
<i>So, she's not going to that guy, right?</i>

884
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:42,512
<i>Good thing I got hurt.</i>

885
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,362
<i>You got hurt real good.</i>

886
00:49:49,594 --> 00:49:52,746
I got some good sleep for once.

887
00:49:56,177 --> 00:49:58,588
I think I'll go to the bathroom.

888
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,896
It doesn't hurt.

889
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:11,519
I'm really okay.

890
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:13,606
Wow. What a relief.

891
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:15,090
Wow.

892
00:50:15,998 --> 00:50:18,550
Oh, you're awake?

893
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:21,351
Are your legs okay, Dong Gu?

894
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,313
Yes, they're fine
after a good night's sleep.

895
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,369
Oh, I'm relieved.

896
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:30,570
Then I'll head to the bakery, Dong Gu.

897
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,429
I'm a bit concerned about my muffins.

898
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:35,346
<i>What? She's going to his bakery again?</i>

899
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:38,112
<i>No, she can't.</i>

900
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:43,762
Oh, my legs.

901
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:46,186
- Dong Gu.
- Ow!

902
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:47,807
Dong Gu, what's wrong?

903
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:50,768
I thought I was okay, but I'm not.

904
00:50:50,768 --> 00:50:52,492
Ow, ow!

905
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:55,967
The pain is worse than yesterday.
What should I do?

906
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:59,538
I don't think I can do anything alone.

907
00:50:59,538 --> 00:51:03,012
Really? Why is it acting up suddenly?
This is a problem.

908
00:51:03,012 --> 00:51:06,748
Sorry, I know you
have to go to the bakery.

909
00:51:06,748 --> 00:51:09,070
No, don't worry about it.

910
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,889
- Dong Gu, I'll take you to bed.
- Okay.

911
00:51:14,898 --> 00:51:18,418
Ouch... ow!

912
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:34,967
Sir, hello.

913
00:51:38,987 --> 00:51:43,858
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Please forgive me.

914
00:51:45,362 --> 00:51:47,119
It's okay.

915
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,170
But don't do it again.

916
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,905
Right, I won't.

917
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,329
Have you eaten yet?

918
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:56,952
No. Not yet.

919
00:51:56,952 --> 00:52:01,208
If you haven't eaten,
do you want this dandwich?

920
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,643
Yes, please.

921
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:09,829
Have this dapple juice too.

922
00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:15,706
What's wrong with you?

923
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,181
It's nothing.

924
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:21,460
Thank you for the food.

925
00:52:30,655 --> 00:52:33,121
Dandwich and dapple juice.

926
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,943
I'm going crazy.

927
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:39,222
Every time he talks, it's funny.

928
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:45,764
What if I laugh again when he says
"Dong Doon Deok, Dong Doon Deok"?

929
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:49,923
No, he doesn't say that name often.

930
00:52:49,923 --> 00:52:52,706
I'll pinch myself and stop.

931
00:52:53,242 --> 00:52:55,978
Oh, this dandwich will go to waste.

932
00:52:55,978 --> 00:52:57,954
Oh, Joon Ki.

933
00:52:57,954 --> 00:52:59,969
The writer edited the script.

934
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,878
- Not much changed, but memorize it.
- Okay.

935
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:05,577
Where is Min Ki Hyung?

936
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:08,994
<i>[Song Joon Seok! Song Joon Seok!
Song Joon Seok!]</i>

937
00:53:08,994 --> 00:53:10,577
Dong Doon Deok?

938
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:12,913
Geez!

939
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:18,210
We're going to start now.

940
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,195
And, cue.

941
00:53:21,195 --> 00:53:25,601
Director, I cannot follow those orders.

942
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:28,010
I will air this news.

943
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,025
What did you say?

944
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:31,898
Even I lose my job as anchor, no...

945
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:35,039
even if I die, I will do this story.

946
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:36,309
Do you understand?

947
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:40,318
Dong Doon Seok,
Dong Doon Seok, Dong Doon Seok!

948
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,139
Are you really going to be like this,
Dong Doon Seok?

949
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:48,550
Do you know what I've done for you,
Dong Doon Seok?

950
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,905
Dong Doon Seok, Dong Doon Seok!

951
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:57,677
There you go again.

952
00:53:57,677 --> 00:53:59,480
What's wrong with you?

953
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:03,239
I'm sorry, sir.

954
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,219
- Is my acting funny?
- No, no.

955
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:08,378
You dare to laugh
when your senior is acting?

956
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,612
Director Kim, I can't shoot this today.

957
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:16,460
- Sir, sir.
- Wait, sir.

958
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,655
Are you crazy? Why do you keep laughing?

959
00:54:19,655 --> 00:54:21,690
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

960
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,519
If Min Ki Hyung quits like this,
you're over with too.

961
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:26,016
Got it?

962
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,201
Sir? Sir!

963
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,269
I'm seriously going insane.

964
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,695
Why do I keep laughing? Why?

965
00:54:43,335 --> 00:54:46,793
Pretending to be sick is hard work too.

966
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:49,945
I'm so stiff.

967
00:54:49,945 --> 00:54:54,336
As long as Yoon Ah
isn't with Song Hyun Joon.

968
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:57,753
Oh, my legs.

969
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:00,503
- Dong Gu, take your medicine.
- Okay.

970
00:55:00,503 --> 00:55:01,934
Are you still in a lot of pain?

971
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:05,547
Yes, it's hurting more and more.

972
00:55:05,547 --> 00:55:09,869
I wonder if I'll ever be able to walk.

973
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:11,411
That's very worrisome.

974
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:14,103
- Take your medicine for now.
- Okay.

975
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,391
Can you get up?

976
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:17,226
I'll do my best.

977
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:24,280
- Here.
- Thank you.

978
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:30,257
Shouldn't you wash up, Dong Gu?

979
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:32,686
Of course, I want to.

980
00:55:32,686 --> 00:55:34,105
Don't worry about it though.

981
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:36,588
Still, you should wash up.

982
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:39,050
Come on. I'll help you.

983
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:43,242
You really don't have to.

984
00:55:43,242 --> 00:55:47,114
- Here you go.
- Oh my. Ow... ow.

985
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:55,398
Oh. Thank you, Yoon Ah.

986
00:55:55,398 --> 00:55:56,869
It's nothing.

987
00:55:57,532 --> 00:55:59,434
How do we wash your hair though?

988
00:55:59,434 --> 00:56:02,300
It's okay.
I'll wash it once I get better.

989
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,257
Still, you should wash your hair.

990
00:56:05,257 --> 00:56:07,572
I'll just wash it for you.

991
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,219
What? You will?

992
00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:13,034
Oh, it's really okay.

993
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:15,885
Then, should I lie down?
What should I do?

994
00:56:22,432 --> 00:56:27,724
I feel so bad
because of these legs of mine.

995
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:29,027
It's okay.

996
00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:31,532
Yes, right there. Oh, yes.

997
00:56:31,532 --> 00:56:33,746
<i>Are you home, Yoon Ah?</i>

998
00:56:33,746 --> 00:56:36,635
Oh, that sounds like Hyun Joon.

999
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,916
What are you doing here, Hyun Joon?

1000
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:44,059
I was so worried about Dong Gu.

1001
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:47,717
<i>The mood was good.
Why is he suddenly here?</i>

1002
00:56:47,717 --> 00:56:49,724
Dong Gu, how are your legs?

1003
00:56:49,724 --> 00:56:51,286
Well...

1004
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,382
they're just so-so.

1005
00:56:52,382 --> 00:56:55,380
It's worse than yesterday and
he can't move on his own at all.

1006
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,197
Really?

1007
00:56:57,197 --> 00:56:59,981
That's a problem.

1008
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:03,266
- What's going on?
- Hello. Yes, Seo Jin.

1009
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:05,936
Huh? Oh, really?

1010
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,847
Okay. I got it.

1011
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:11,018
What? Is something going on?

1012
00:57:11,018 --> 00:57:15,195
Seo Jin left an important document
at home and asked me to bring it to work.

1013
00:57:15,195 --> 00:57:17,996
I can't just leave you here.
What should I do?

1014
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:19,239
That kid.

1015
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:21,780
You should go. I'll stay here.

1016
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,543
Could you? Then I'll be back soon.

1017
00:57:24,543 --> 00:57:25,751
Okay.

1018
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:28,719
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah.

1019
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,527
How can you just leave?

1020
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:31,795
I'll rinse it out for you.

1021
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:33,677
What? Are you crazy?

1022
00:57:33,677 --> 00:57:35,202
Rinse what?

1023
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,510
There are all these bubbles.
You can't stay here like this.

1024
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:39,945
I'm fine.

1025
00:57:39,945 --> 00:57:42,206
Stay put. I'll rinse it for you.

1026
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:45,153
I said I'm fine.
Don't touch my hair.

1027
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:47,324
Just stay put and don't move.

1028
00:57:49,663 --> 00:57:52,753
I think it needs another rinse.

1029
00:57:52,753 --> 00:57:54,844
I said I'm fine.
It's been rinsed out.

1030
00:57:54,844 --> 00:57:56,931
There are bubbles left.
I'll bring water.

1031
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,902
Hey, now. I said it's fine. I'm fine.

1032
00:57:59,902 --> 00:58:01,929
There are bubbles still there.

1033
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:04,340
No! I'm done. It's rinsed out.

1034
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,719
There are bubbles still there.

1035
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:07,911
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

1036
00:58:07,911 --> 00:58:09,244
Let go of the water!

1037
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:17,251
I told you I was fine! What is this?

1038
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:19,463
Oh, I'm sorry.

1039
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:21,186
You're all wet.

1040
00:58:21,186 --> 00:58:24,793
Where is your room?
I'll change you in your room.

1041
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,277
What did you say? Change me?

1042
00:58:27,277 --> 00:58:29,545
What is with you, seriously?

1043
00:58:30,943 --> 00:58:32,789
- Should I put you down?
- Yes, put me down!

1044
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:34,068
What are you doing?

1045
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:37,987
Okay, I'll change you out of those
clothes now.

1046
00:58:37,987 --> 00:58:41,835
Hey! I said I'm fine. I'm okay.

1047
00:58:41,835 --> 00:58:44,371
Please just stay put, would you?

1048
00:58:44,371 --> 00:58:47,248
Where should we start?
Oh, the pants first.

1049
00:58:47,248 --> 00:58:49,760
What is wrong with you?

1050
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,250
Let go. I just feel bad is all.

1051
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:56,384
I'll change myself, okay?
I'll get changed.

1052
00:58:56,384 --> 00:58:58,112
How though?

1053
00:58:58,112 --> 00:59:00,532
I thought you couldn't move
because your legs hurt.

1054
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:03,460
Oh... were you pretending to be hurt?

1055
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,813
What? Pretending to be hurt?

1056
00:59:06,813 --> 00:59:09,063
What kind of person do you think I am?

1057
00:59:09,063 --> 00:59:11,213
So, just stay still.

1058
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:18,545
Your underwear is all wet too.
You need to change those.

1059
00:59:18,545 --> 00:59:20,795
There's nothing you won't do, is there?

1060
00:59:20,795 --> 00:59:23,882
I told you to stay put.
What's with you?

1061
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:29,923
It's off.

1062
00:59:30,594 --> 00:59:33,088
Dong Gu, where is your underwear?

1063
00:59:34,126 --> 00:59:38,206
How can you strip me and leave?

1064
00:59:50,568 --> 00:59:52,172
Yeah, Bacca.

1065
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,565
Joon Ki, is the shoot going well?

1066
00:59:54,565 --> 00:59:59,376
<i>No, I laughed again
and got into big trouble.</i>

1067
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:02,615
I think I'll get fired if I laugh again.
What do I do?

1068
01:00:02,615 --> 01:00:04,208
This is an issue.

1069
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:07,403
Then how about thinking about
something else whenever it's funny.

1070
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:08,806
Like something sad.

1071
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,344
I've tried it all.

1072
01:00:10,344 --> 01:00:13,445
I pinch my thigh and bite my tongue.

1073
01:00:13,445 --> 01:00:14,784
"Dong Doon Deok."

1074
01:00:14,784 --> 01:00:16,905
Whenever I hear that, I laugh.

1075
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,385
Nothing works.

1076
01:00:18,385 --> 01:00:21,179
Really? Then what can you do?

1077
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:25,253
Joon Ki, how about this?

1078
01:00:25,253 --> 01:00:26,641
What?

1079
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:30,474
Sir.

1080
01:00:30,474 --> 01:00:33,023
I'm so sorry about before.

1081
01:00:33,023 --> 01:00:35,963
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

1082
01:00:35,963 --> 01:00:37,965
It's fine.

1083
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:42,293
If you laugh one more time,
I won't let it slide.

1084
01:00:42,293 --> 01:00:44,293
- All right?
- Yes.

1085
01:00:44,293 --> 01:00:46,753
I understand.

1086
01:00:46,753 --> 01:00:48,440
We'll get started now.

1087
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,605
And... cue.

1088
01:00:52,123 --> 01:00:56,161
Director, I cannot follow those orders.

1089
01:00:56,161 --> 01:00:58,791
I will air this news.

1090
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,791
What did you say?

1091
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:02,251
Even I lose my job as anchor, no...

1092
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:06,474
even if I die, I will do this story.

1093
01:01:06,474 --> 01:01:07,713
Do you understand?

1094
01:01:07,713 --> 01:01:10,943
Dong Doon Deok,
Dong Doon Deok, Dong Doon Deok!

1095
01:01:10,943 --> 01:01:13,501
Are you really going to be like this,
Dong Doon Deok?

1096
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:23,827
<i>I'm seriously going crazy.</i>

1097
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:26,628
<i>I'm really dead if I laugh here.</i>

1098
01:01:26,628 --> 01:01:28,898
<i>What should I do?</i>

1099
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:32,900
<i>Wait, should I do what Seo Jin suggested?</i>

1100
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:37,757
If you're about to laugh,
think about what you fear the most.

1101
01:01:37,757 --> 01:01:41,362
You know, something that gives you
goosebumps all over your body.

1102
01:01:41,362 --> 01:01:44,445
<i>Sure, I have nothing to lose.</i>

1103
01:01:44,445 --> 01:01:47,356
<i>Let me give it a try.</i>

1104
01:01:47,356 --> 01:01:50,402
Do you know what I've done for you,
Dong Doon Deok?

1105
01:01:55,021 --> 01:01:59,003
You will be smelling incense
at your own funeral.

1106
01:01:59,003 --> 01:02:01,144
Dong Doon Deok!

1107
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:08,742
You will be smelling incense
at your own funeral.

1108
01:02:08,742 --> 01:02:10,637
Dong Doon Deok!

1109
01:02:10,637 --> 01:02:17,032
You will be smelling incense
at your own funeral.

1110
01:02:17,032 --> 01:02:19,213
Dong Doon Deok!

1111
01:02:19,213 --> 01:02:24,114
You will be smelling incense
at your own funeral.

1112
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:31,476
You will be finished in this industry.

1113
01:02:31,476 --> 01:02:33,840
Understand, Dong Doon Deok!

1114
01:02:34,757 --> 01:02:36,496
Do as you wish.

1115
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:40,215
However, is it the job of the media
to hide problems?

1116
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:43,940
Should the media distort the truth
and provoke the people?

1117
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:47,295
The media should not distort
the truth or conceal the truth.

1118
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:51,253
That is our duty and our job
as members of the media.

1119
01:02:51,253 --> 01:02:52,664
Do you know that?

1120
01:02:52,664 --> 01:02:54,994
Cut! Okay.

1121
01:02:54,994 --> 01:02:57,894
That was great, Joon Ki.

1122
01:02:57,894 --> 01:02:59,735
Thank you, Director.

1123
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:02,099
- Thank you, Senior.
- Good work.

1124
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:04,849
Why didn't you do it
without laughing before?

1125
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:07,769
I really liked your acting.

1126
01:03:09,438 --> 01:03:12,659
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1127
01:03:14,478 --> 01:03:17,409
Thank you, Dong Gu.
This is all thanks to you.

1128
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:22,753
<i>Ah... that was so embarrassing.</i>

1129
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:26,568
<i>What did I show to that guy,
of all people?</i>

1130
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:32,197
<i>Why do things like this
always happen with that guy? Why?</i>

1131
01:03:36,106 --> 01:03:39,619
Sorry, I was late, right?
I got on the wrong bus.

1132
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:41,487
Oh, it's fine.

1133
01:03:42,007 --> 01:03:44,425
What's wrong with Dong Gu?

1134
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:46,103
Did something happen?

1135
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:47,208
Well...

1136
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,030
No, nothing happened.

1137
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,351
That's a relief.

1138
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:56,277
You suffered a lot, Hyun Joon.

1139
01:03:56,277 --> 01:03:57,963
Suffered? Not really.

1140
01:03:57,963 --> 01:03:59,418
I'll get going.

1141
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,027
I'll see you out.

1142
01:04:01,027 --> 01:04:02,884
Hold on.

1143
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:06,097
I'll see him out.
You stay put, Yoon Ah.

1144
01:04:06,097 --> 01:04:10,306
He looked after me,
so of course I should see him out.

1145
01:04:17,717 --> 01:04:20,233
No, no. Don't bother.

1146
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:30,672
Wait. Let's talk for a moment.

1147
01:04:30,672 --> 01:04:34,202
Let's pretend
today's events didn't happen.

1148
01:04:34,202 --> 01:04:37,391
You know I saw yours last time, right?

1149
01:04:37,391 --> 01:04:40,474
We could both get hurt, you know.

1150
01:04:41,663 --> 01:04:43,934
Okay, we'll pretend nothing happened.

1151
01:04:43,934 --> 01:04:45,161
Satisfied?

1152
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:47,561
Well, yes.

1153
01:04:47,561 --> 01:04:50,954
Did you really come out of worry for me?

1154
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:52,251
Yes.

1155
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:54,625
I came because
I want you to get better soon.

1156
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:56,670
- Really?
- Yes.

1157
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,010
That way, I can see Yoon Ah sooner.

1158
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:02,692
So, it wasn't because of me,
but Yoon Ah.

1159
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:05,222
Is that something a man should do?

1160
01:05:05,222 --> 01:05:08,173
I don't think faking an injury
is something a man should do either.

1161
01:05:08,173 --> 01:05:10,755
What... what did you say?

1162
01:05:10,755 --> 01:05:13,208
What fake injury are you talking about?

1163
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,920
Are you saying I'm pretending right now?

1164
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,038
Never mind if you're not.

1165
01:05:18,038 --> 01:05:21,614
I hope you get better soon. Goodbye.

1166
01:05:22,576 --> 01:05:25,329
Hey, I won't get better.

1167
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:27,195
For whose enjoyment?

1168
01:05:27,195 --> 01:05:31,019
That guy, he's not even listening.

1169
01:05:32,878 --> 01:05:36,418
I think he's caught on.

1170
01:05:36,418 --> 01:05:39,487
What? Then, he did that
on purpose earlier?

1171
01:05:39,487 --> 01:05:40,980
That guy!

1172
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:47,583
Ow, ow!

1173
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:51,052
Oh, Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah!

1174
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:53,224
Yoon Ah, let me see. Are you hurt?

1175
01:05:53,224 --> 01:05:54,653
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1176
01:05:54,653 --> 01:05:56,414
Gosh, that guy...

1177
01:05:56,414 --> 01:05:59,175
Oh, Dong Gu... your legs.

1178
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:10,809
Oh my. My legs. Oh my...

1179
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:13,391
You run well for a guy
who can't move at all.

1180
01:06:13,391 --> 01:06:15,519
You're like Usain Bolt.

1181
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,697
Were you pretending
to be hurt in front of me?

1182
01:06:17,697 --> 01:06:20,179
I'm not pretending.

1183
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:24,978
I think I got momentary super strength.

1184
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:26,389
Whatever.

1185
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:28,347
Stop pretending and get up.

1186
01:06:28,347 --> 01:06:30,657
I told you I'm not pretending.

1187
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:34,659
I'm Kang Dong Gu, Kang Dong Gu.
I'm a real man.

1188
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:39,719
Really? Then come in on your own
with that super strength of yours.

1189
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:41,914
Yoon Ah.

1190
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,719
Yoon Ah, you have to wait for me.

1191
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:44,782
Yoon Ah.

1192
01:06:44,782 --> 01:06:48,476
I really am in pain.
I wasn't lying. Yoon Ah.

1193
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:50,885
You have to put me in the wheelchair.

1194
01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:52,909
Yoon Ah...

1195
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:55,398
I really am hurt.

1196
01:06:55,398 --> 01:06:58,010
The ground is cold.
