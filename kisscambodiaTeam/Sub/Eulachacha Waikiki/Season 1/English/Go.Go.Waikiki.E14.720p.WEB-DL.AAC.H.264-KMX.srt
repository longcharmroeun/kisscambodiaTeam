00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:12,897
You did it, didn't you?

4
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:14,237
You did it.

5
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:17,442
Yes, I stopped that story from going out.

6
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:20,277
Don't you know the anchor
gets to edit the news?

7
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,018
What?

8
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:25,359
You still consider yourself a reporter?
You're not embarrassed?

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,126
Stop acting so righteous.

10
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:31,702
You... you...

11
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:34,341
You'll get hurt at this rate.

12
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:37,718
What? You punk.

13
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,040
Cut.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,609
That was good. Let's do the next scene.

15
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:44,927
Senior, are you okay?

16
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,540
I couldn't control my punch well.

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,902
Oh, it's fine.
That can happen while acting.

18
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:51,356
Don't worry about it.

19
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:53,094
Thank you, Senior.

20
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,386
Joon Ki, your phone.

21
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:57,543
It's been ringing for a while.
You should pick up.

22
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:59,786
Okay. Thank you.

23
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:03,220
Hello. Yes, I'm Lee Joon Ki. Yes.

24
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,518
What?

25
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:11,795
Yes, yes. I understand.

26
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,972
What was that about?

27
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,543
Oh, it was just...

28
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:23,912
they would like me to film a commercial.

29
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:26,105
A coffee commercial, at that.

30
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:30,737
What? Wow, even I've never
done a coffee commercial.

31
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:32,596
Congratulations, Joon Ki.

32
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:34,376
Very cool.

33
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:36,109
Thank you, Senior.

Stop!

42
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:05,424
Wow! Look at that facial expression.

43
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:08,533
Don't you just feel the charisma?

44
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,536
"You punk."

45
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:12,865
Isn't it just awesome?

46
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,193
We got it already.
Let's watch something else now.

47
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:16,551
I'm so sick of it.

48
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,111
Sick of it?

49
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,859
You punk.

50
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,195
Gosh, he's doing this
as a supporting actor.

51
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:28,675
How bad is he going to be
if he gets a main role?

52
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,935
What? You terrible girl.

53
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:35,735
Why is that company using you as
a model for their commercial anyway?

54
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:37,975
A coffee commercial
is only for top stars.

55
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,903
Are they determined to be ruined?

56
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:43,560
What? You punk.

57
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:46,741
Give it a rest, okay?

58
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:48,843
I'll be going to my meeting
for the commercial.

59
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:51,618
Wait. Joon Ki, lend me your car today.

60
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:53,149
My precious Rebecca?

61
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,412
Why? For what reason?

62
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:57,262
It's uncomfortable to get clothes
without a car.

63
00:02:57,262 --> 00:03:00,048
I don't like to pay for a taxi either,
so I want to practice driving.

64
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,777
Is the car okay?

65
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:05,324
Of course, Rebecca is strong.

66
00:03:05,324 --> 00:03:08,647
But... don't ever touch
the passenger side window.

67
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,896
Why?

68
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:16,034
<i>That window has a sad legend.</i>

69
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:19,403
Take care of my Rebecca and cherish her.

70
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:22,094
- Yeah.
- It'd be better not to drive it.

71
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:23,131
Don't worry.

72
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:25,830
It costs money to get driving lessons.

73
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,717
It's okay. Doo Shik will do it for me.

74
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:31,729
Me? When, where, what, how, why?

75
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:32,968
Just follow me.

76
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:35,217
Wait. I'm not even wearing socks.

77
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:38,048
It's okay. We'll just be in the car.

78
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,813
- We'll be back.
- Hey, hey.

79
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:40,986
Doo Shik, it's dangerous.

80
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:43,342
- Bye now.
- Be careful.

81
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:45,665
That car is rough.

82
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:48,342
Then, I'll be going now too.

83
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:50,998
I have to go to work too.
Let's go together.

84
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,191
Okay.

85
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:55,331
Kang Seo Jin, stop.

86
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:58,062
I told you to stay at least
five meters away from him.

87
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:00,723
Leave five minutes after Joon Ki leaves.

88
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:04,213
What? How long are you keeping this up?

89
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:07,912
Until this weird anxiety goes away.

90
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:10,308
Sit down, please.

91
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:13,050
- Geez.
- Geez?

92
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,280
Then, I'll get going first.

93
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,117
Yes. Get going.

94
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,454
You're the queen of abuse.

95
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:26,242
This is so annoying.

96
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:30,964
What? Do you have
something else to do besides this?

97
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:35,201
- No.
- You don't even have anything to do.

98
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:39,074
You know how to drive, right?

99
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:41,774
Of course,
I got my license eight years ago.

100
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:43,841
Though, I've never driven since then.

101
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,274
What? Never?

102
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,223
It's okay. It's okay.

103
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:50,625
Once I get used to it,
I'll pick it up right away.

104
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,956
I'm going to go now.

105
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:56,223
This is so annoying.

106
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:59,396
Doo Shik, which one is the brake?

107
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:01,800
- Left or right?
- What?

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,343
You don't even know that
and you're going to drive?

109
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:08,064
It's been a long time,
so I'm just confused.

110
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:11,137
I have a bad feeling.
I have a really bad feeling.

111
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:14,564
What is with this thing?

112
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:20,072
Why isn't this opening?

113
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:21,641
That side only opens from the outside.

114
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:24,295
Gosh, nothing works properly in this car.

115
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:25,783
- Hold on.
- Okay.

116
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,154
Hey, what are you doing?

117
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:30,815
Seriously, really?

118
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:44,014
Director Bong,
what are you doing? Let's go.

119
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:46,074
Okay, I'm coming.

120
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:53,805
Okay, I'm going to go now.

121
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:01,754
Seriously, what are you doing, dummy?

122
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:03,598
Dummy? Do you want to die?

123
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,137
I take it back.

124
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,333
I'm really going now.

Hey! You jerk!

129
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,879
Stop.

130
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,420
Seo Jin, it's me. It's just me.

131
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,841
Joon Ki? What was that?
You scared me.

132
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:33,048
Are you okay?

133
00:06:33,048 --> 00:06:35,930
No one followed you, right?

134
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,300
I'm talking about Dong Gu.

135
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,880
Why would he follow me?

136
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,642
You think Dong Gu
has nothing better to do?

137
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:44,107
Didn't you see the look in his eyes?
The Grim Reaper look?

138
00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:46,733
- We really need to be careful.
- Goodness.

139
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:49,255
Are we dating or filming a spy movie?

140
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,365
It never hurts to be careful.

141
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:54,355
Should we go for some morning coffee?

142
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:56,716
I thought you had to go for that meeting.

143
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:01,360
I have time for coffee with you, Bacca,
so don't you worry.

144
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,641
I really hope you get that commercial.

145
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:08,949
Don't worry. It's almost confirmed.

146
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,451
Really? Did you tell
your father about it too?

147
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:13,937
- He was happy, right?
- Yes.

148
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:16,576
He praised me and said he was proud.

149
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:21,247
I think it was the first time my father
has given me recognition in 31 years.

150
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,860
Gosh, that's my boyfriend.

151
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:36,120
Damn it. I lost her.

152
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,949
Did she notice me?

153
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:40,829
Kang Seo Jin, Lee Joon Ki.

154
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:43,485
Just wait until I catch you two.

155
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:50,716
That will be the day
you smell incense at your funerals.

156
00:07:57,838 --> 00:08:02,182
There are no cars or people,
so it's perfect for practicing.

157
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,206
Well, driving is no big deal.

158
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:08,093
Oh, I forgot the most important thing.

159
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:13,610
Are you crazy?
How can you let go of the wheel?

160
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,125
You grabbed it.
That's good enough.

161
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:21,807
You have to wear sunglasses
when driving to look cool.

162
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,499
What are you talking about?
Hurry up and take the wheel.

163
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:26,779
Do you think this is
a self-driving car, you psycho?

164
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,966
- What?
- I take it back, so take the wheel.

165
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,690
Just hold on. I'm looking in the mirror.

166
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,479
What kind of person are you?

167
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,544
Gosh...

168
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,649
What am I doing here?

169
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,211
You think it's funny too?

170
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:50,495
Dong Gu, what are you doing?

171
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:52,274
Why are you digging out a loaf of bread?

172
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:53,625
Oh, this?

173
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,784
I have to check to see if
an air gun can fit in this bread.

174
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:59,615
You're putting an air gun in the bread?

175
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,120
Our movie's main character
is a secret agent.

176
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,183
He puts his air gun in a loaf of bread.

177
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:06,056
- Why would he do that?
- I really don't know.

178
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:08,918
They say it was my idea,
but I don't remember that at all.

179
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:11,746
They just want me to put
the air gun in the bread.

180
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:14,205
I don't know what I'm doing.

181
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:15,227
Are you going somewhere?

182
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:17,352
Yes, I'm going to the bakery.

183
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:18,722
Again?

184
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:21,068
Aren't you going too often lately?

185
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:22,734
There's lots to do here too.

186
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:25,205
I finished all my work here.

187
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:26,644
Really?

188
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:30,443
I looked around yesterday
and there are a lot of things to fix.

189
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:31,995
Fix? Like what?

190
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:34,673
Oh, like the second floor dormitory room.

191
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:37,126
You mean that door handle being shaky?

192
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,888
I bought a new one this morning
and changed it.

193
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:41,686
You did?

194
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:43,312
The private room on the second floor--

195
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,918
The light blinking every four seconds?

196
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,620
I went up on a ladder yesterday
and changed the light bulb.

197
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,777
Oh, yes. The third floor--

198
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:55,052
The third floor stair
being slightly wobbly?

199
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:59,153
I bought a welding machine this morning
and I repaired that.

200
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:00,365
Then you should go.

201
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,493
I'll get going.

202
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:03,446
Sol, Mom will be going now.

203
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:06,027
Please watch Sol for me. Bye.

204
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:08,326
Yes. Bye.

205
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,370
What's with her?

206
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,120
Sol, your mom even does welding now.

207
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,221
She's a total technician.

208
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:19,875
I really can't have her with
Song Hyun Joon all the time.

209
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,352
Gosh, I really don't know.

210
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:25,409
Why are we putting the air gun in here?

211
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,769
What kind of movie is this?

212
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,138
<i>Joon Ki, I'm sorry about this.</i>

213
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:33,258
The advertising company suddenly
recommended Kim Jae Hyun.

214
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,011
Sorry, Joon Ki.

215
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,432
I said I wouldn't do it,
but the agency is pressuring me.

216
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:41,462
No. It's okay, Senior.

217
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:45,610
Still, I seem like a senior going after
my junior's commercial offers.

218
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,710
This isn't right.

219
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:52,172
Why was it that I was recommended?

220
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:57,201
Oh, that's because the most important
thing with this commercial is the smile.

221
00:10:57,201 --> 00:11:02,231
There were some who thought
Joon Ki's smile was a little lacking.

222
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:06,071
So, what kind of smile
are you looking for?

223
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:10,451
A refreshing smile that's looks
like you ate the morning dew.

224
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:15,032
Ah, a refreshing smile
like you ate the morning dew?

225
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:17,152
First, let's go eat and talk.

226
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:18,654
Shall we do that?

227
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:22,783
- Oh my!
- Senior.

228
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,313
Jae Hyun, are you okay?

229
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,534
I'm all right.

230
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:30,322
<i>What's going on?
Why is he suddenly smiling?</i>

231
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,240
It looks like you had a hard fall.

232
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,543
It does hurt a bit.

233
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:39,340
I really am... okay.

234
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:43,182
<i>Oh, he's smiling again.</i>

235
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:46,019
<i>Don't tell me he's trying to
win them over with his smile.</i>

236
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:51,446
I feel like I'm all right now.

237
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:55,686
<i>He is trying to win them over.</i>

238
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:57,585
<i>I could lose the commercial.</i>

239
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,255
Shall we go eat then?

240
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:01,602
Yes.

241
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:04,543
Oh, I just got a call.

242
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:06,649
One moment.

243
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:08,091
Hello.

244
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,378
What?

245
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:14,139
Is that for real? How could that happen?

246
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,666
Okay.

247
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,760
What is it? Did something happen?

248
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,054
A friend I know is unconscious
and is now in surgery.

249
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:25,490
He's like a brother to me.

250
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,000
His name is Kang Dong Gu.

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,288
You must be very worried, Joon Ki.

252
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:30,928
Oh no.

253
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,379
I'll be fine.

254
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:41,006
Yeah, I'm sure he will be okay.
Stay strong, Joon Ki.

255
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:45,615
Yes, I should be optimistic
during hard times.

256
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,530
I'm okay.

257
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:50,751
Okay. Good.

258
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:54,849
What should we have for lunch today?

259
00:12:54,849 --> 00:13:01,649
Oh, how about tofu kimchi or sandwiches?

260
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,527
- How about you, Joon Ki?
- As for me...

261
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:09,929
I like tofu kimchi and sandwiches too.

262
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:13,299
I also like sushi too.

263
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,388
Hey, hey, hey.
How long are you going to take?

264
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:20,049
Why are you fixing your makeup
instead of driving?

265
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:23,625
The glasses don't cover my skin,
so don't you see it's getting damaged.

266
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,630
Be quiet and grab the wheel.

267
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,192
All right, all right.

268
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,889
This is so hard.

269
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:32,581
Hey, hey, hey! Slow down too.

270
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:35,806
You're going too fast. Brake, brake!

271
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,010
- What is this?
- What?

272
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,693
What is this? Is this the brake?

273
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,743
- It is the brake.
- Huh?

274
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,410
The brake is broken.
This is big news. Oh...

275
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,716
Is this the time to be in wonder
about it? This is crazy.

276
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,051
What the heck?

277
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:58,009
- The brake's not attached to the car.
- Oh, what do I do?

278
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,999
Doo Shik, what do we do now?

279
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,993
Take your foot off the accelerator.

280
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:04,971
- We'll slow down then.
- Okay.

281
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,667
What is this? I took my foot off,
but we're not slowing down.

282
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,356
Doo Shik, what do I do?

283
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:12,945
We'll end up in an accident.

284
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:15,519
Oh! Side, side brake.

285
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:18,317
What is this?

286
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,884
What kind of car is this?

287
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:24,029
Doo Shik, what do we do? What do we do?

288
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,927
Su Ah, this won't do.
We'd better call the police.

289
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:29,457
- Call the police.
- Okay, call them.

290
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:31,730
My phone, my phone.

291
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:41,995
I think I left my phone
on top of the car.

292
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,241
Su Ah, give me your phone.
Give it to me.

293
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:46,361
Okay, my phone.

294
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:50,410
Oh, my phone. Where did it go?

295
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:57,413
Gosh, what do I do?
I think I left it at home.

296
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,332
Seriously!

297
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,359
This won't do. We have no choice.

298
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:07,024
What are you doing?
Joon Ki said not to touch that window.

299
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:08,722
It has a sad legend.

300
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:11,760
What can I do when
my phone is on top of the car?

301
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:16,292
Why won't this go down any farther?

302
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,927
I'm going crazy. Lee Joon Ki, seriously!

303
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:21,404
He's really too much.

304
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:30,614
I think I can get it. I think I can...

305
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:33,168
Hey, hey. Why are you
putting the window up?

306
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:36,049
- I didn't put it up.
- Hey, it hurts, Su Ah.

307
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,323
Try to put it down.
My blood's not flowing.

308
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:42,332
- I'm cold, Su Ah.
- This isn't working either.

309
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:44,373
What kind of car is this?

310
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:45,828
Ouch, Su Ah. Ow.

311
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:48,121
What do I do?
There's a big street up there.

312
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:51,220
Big street? Left turn, left turn.

313
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,865
Go into that construction area.

314
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:57,085
- Okay.
- Hey, drive slowly.

315
00:15:57,085 --> 00:15:58,995
Go in. Drive straight in.

316
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:02,388
- What do I do?
- To the side a bit.

317
00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:04,023
You actually drove into it?

318
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:06,336
Doo Shik, what should I do now?

319
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:09,313
For now, just go in circles over there.

320
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:11,331
Just keep going in circles,
round and round.

321
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:12,572
What? Go in circles?

322
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,482
What else can we do?
We'll get in an accident out there.

323
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:17,768
Who told you
to suddenly practice driving?

324
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,212
You think I knew this would happen?

325
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:29,980
Joon Ki, try eating this.

326
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,085
Thank you, Senior.

327
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:40,312
Wow. It's nice to see you two like this.

328
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:44,062
Of course.
We're practically like brothers.

329
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,469
Director.

330
00:16:48,469 --> 00:16:50,962
Do you have a concept
for the commercial already?

331
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:52,668
Yes, of course.

332
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:57,658
Like I told you already,
the most important thing is the smile.

333
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,788
Next, it's the facial expression.

334
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:02,729
You must have abundant facial expressions

335
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,710
like the seven colors of the rainbow.

336
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:10,299
Ah, abundant expressions like
the seven colors of the rainbow?

337
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,325
- Yes. Let's eat.
- Yes.

338
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,844
Wow.

339
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:20,470
Oh... oh. It's so sour.

340
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,445
So sour... so sour.

341
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:25,795
- Is the kimchi that sour?
- Yes.

342
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:30,124
- It's like I bit into a sour lemon.
- A lemon?

343
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:32,726
So sour. I think I need water.

344
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:38,686
Ah, so cold. It's so cold.

345
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:40,584
<i>He's at it again.</i>

346
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:43,304
<i>Fine, you want to go for it?</i>

347
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:47,579
Oh, that pepper looks delicious.

348
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:53,528
Oh, oh, oh.

349
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:55,718
My mouth feels like it's on fire.

350
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:57,847
Oh, it's so spicy.

351
00:17:57,847 --> 00:17:59,817
I need this cold kimchi broth.

352
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:04,338
Oh, it's so sweet and refreshing.

353
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:08,778
It's both refreshing and sweet
at the same time.

354
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:12,334
It tastes so rich, sweet, and fresh.

355
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:21,193
How long do we have to do this?

356
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,633
I don't know.

357
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:27,082
We have to keep going
until the car runs out of gas.

358
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,431
How can there be no one passing by?

359
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,998
<i>Why is my stomach so gassy?</i>

360
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,608
<i>Did I have too much pizza earlier?</i>

361
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:41,134
<i>I need to fart. What do I do?</i>

362
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:42,785
<i>Ah...</i>

363
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:49,128
You startled me.
What was that? Why did you honk?

364
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,240
Oh, there was a cat.

365
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,420
A cat? What cat?

366
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,098
Oh, what is this smell?

367
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,363
Is there some sort of sewer nearby?

368
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:04,838
Min Su Ah. You farted, didn't you?

369
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:07,050
That's why you honked, right?

370
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,160
No, it was because there was a cat.

371
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,960
Yeah right. You think you can
hide it if you cover up the sound?

372
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
What will you do about the smell?

373
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,912
Fine, I farted.

374
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:18,844
You really have crap manners though.

375
00:19:18,844 --> 00:19:21,215
You should pretend
not to know if a girl farts.

376
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,728
Do you really have to say something?

377
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:26,519
They say the person who farts
gets angry and it really is true.

378
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,778
Never mind.
No wonder you've never dated anyone.

379
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:33,112
What? Why are you
poking me where it hurts?

380
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:36,559
Whatever. I'm not going to talk to you.

381
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,519
You scared me. What was that?

382
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,648
Did you fart again?

383
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,618
No, I said it was a cat.

384
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:44,258
Oh, the smell seriously.

385
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:45,961
What did you eat?

386
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,098
I said it's because of the cat.

387
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:49,380
Stop farting!

388
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,766
I said it's not because I'm farting!

389
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:53,769
By the way, Director...

390
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:58,619
is there anything else that's important
besides the abundant expressions?

391
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,233
Something else?

392
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,291
The voice is important too.

393
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,544
How should I put it?

394
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:11,273
A smooth voice that is like coffee
melting in hot water.

395
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:15,566
Like Gong Yoo from "Goblin"
or Sung Shi Kyung.

396
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,289
Gong Yoo or Sung Shi Kyung.

397
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:22,263
Oh, Director. You're out of stew.

398
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:26,470
- Excuse me, ma'am!
- Yes.

399
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:30,817
Because it tasted good and
the seasoning was right...

400
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:33,759
Because our time with stew was good...

401
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,578
we would like to order
one more soybean stew.

402
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:37,943
- What?
- Also...

403
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,738
Because the texture was good...

404
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:43,946
Because it was cooked just right...

405
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:47,454
Because we enjoyed our time
with the rice grain...

406
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,666
we would like one more rice, as well.

407
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,390
Ah, okay.

408
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,388
One more soybean stew
and rice at table three!

409
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:57,839
Oh, I have a phone call suddenly.

410
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,758
I just need to take one phone call.

411
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:04,769
Hello? What?

412
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,871
Now?

413
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:08,065
I'm not in the right place to do so.

414
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:10,849
I guess I have to.

415
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,556
<i>It would have been nice</i>

416
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:19,326
<i>if I had held your hand tightly
and just...</i>

417
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:23,627
<i>walked this path, then I...</i>

418
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:27,619
Joon Ki, why are you suddenly singing?

419
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:32,606
Ah, you know that friend
I told you about, Kang Dong Gu?

420
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:34,946
He's in surgery right now.

421
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:36,989
He asked to hear me sing.

422
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:38,342
Then you should sing.

423
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:42,946
Thank you for understanding.
Then I'll keep going.

424
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:45,457
<i>It would have been nice</i>

425
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:50,518
<i>if I had held your hand tightly
and just...</i>

426
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:55,067
<i>walked this path, then I...</i>

427
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,490
<i>only have you.</i>

428
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:02,659
<i>Oh, this is so hard.</i>

429
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:05,321
<i>How many hours has it been?</i>

430
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:08,693
<i>Maybe it was the pizza I ate.
My stomach's starting to hurt.</i>

431
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:10,662
<i>I'm going crazy.</i>

432
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,567
<i>Oh, my stomach.</i>

433
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,925
<i>I keep farting, so this is not normal.</i>

434
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:22,299
Hey, aren't you going too far?

435
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,128
What did I do?
I told you there was a cat.

436
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:27,422
Stop it with the cat!

437
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:30,185
Hey, you think only you
have stomach troubles? I do too.

438
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:35,153
If I let go a little,
I could cause a big problem here too.

439
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:39,022
However, I'm holding it all in
because I have manners.

440
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:42,632
Forget it. I'm not going to talk to you.
Don't talk to me.

441
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:48,380
Why don't you just go poop instead?

442
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,571
Just poop!

443
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:12,402
Why are you staring? I can't focus.

444
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:14,599
You just look happy.

445
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,699
That's how you look when you bake.

446
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:18,827
- Do I?
- Yes.

447
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:22,731
Was it your dream since you were
young to be a patisseur?

448
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:26,990
Yes, I liked bread so much
ever since I was young.

449
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,000
So, I spent so much money on bread.

450
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,880
"This won't do.
I need to make it myself."

451
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,179
That's how I started and I ended up here.

452
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:39,272
Stop joking.

453
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:41,001
How about you, Yoon Ah?

454
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:42,878
Was your dream to be a patisseur?

455
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:46,458
No, I had another dream.

456
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,107
I gave up on it.

457
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:50,809
Really? What was it?

458
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,290
A rapper.

459
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:54,162
A rapper?

460
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,088
I thought that my rapping
was pretty good.

461
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:00,651
Others couldn't understand my swag.

462
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,849
Yoon Ah raps.

463
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,789
I'm very curious.

464
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:07,630
Really? Would you like to hear it?

465
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,388
I'd be honored.

466
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:13,727
Then I'll use you as a model
to come up with one.

467
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:16,214
<i>Yeah.</i>

468
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:19,486
<i>Get it. This is Hyun Joon's story.</i>

469
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:23,134
<i>The boy who liked bread,
Hyun Joon Song.</i>

470
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:26,359
<i>Hyun Joon likes bread.
He thinks it's delicious.</i>

471
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:31,925
<i>Baguette, croissant, sausage bread,
vegetable bread, red bean, cream bread.</i>

472
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:34,386
<i>Bread, bread. Chew it well.</i>

473
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:36,441
<i>Yum, yum. Woo!</i>

474
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:46,535
Gosh, why does it take so long
to decide on a model?

475
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:51,484
They're wasting my time
when I don't even want this commercial.

476
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:57,364
I think the director
has a very good impression of you.

477
00:24:57,364 --> 00:25:01,082
Joon Ki, you have to treat me
if you get this commercial, okay?

478
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,268
Okay.

479
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:07,953
<i>[Father]</i>

480
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,801
Yes, Father. What is it?

481
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:18,648
Oh, the commercial?
It hasn't been decided yet.

482
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:20,586
I'm waiting on it.

483
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:23,344
<i>I said don't worry about it,
Chairman Park.</i>

484
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:26,473
<i>We just decided on Jae Hyun.</i>

485
00:25:26,473 --> 00:25:29,614
Hold on, Father.

486
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:31,215
I told you.

487
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:33,494
Why wouldn't I do a favor for you,
Chairman Park?

488
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:37,285
The director pushed for it and
we decided on Jae Hyun. Don't worry.

489
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,005
In return, don't forget about
the bag you promised me.

490
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,880
I'll send you the bag model name
through text, okay?

491
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:50,863
Father.

492
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:54,578
Sorry, I'll have to call you back later.

493
00:25:54,902 --> 00:25:55,930
Yes.

494
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:05,176
<i>Oh, my stomach hurts.</i>

495
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:07,640
<i>Oh, I can't even breathe now.</i>

496
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,828
<i>I might explode and poo in front
of Su Ah, at this rate.</i>

497
00:26:10,828 --> 00:26:13,096
<i>That can't happen. Oh...</i>

498
00:26:13,096 --> 00:26:17,118
<i>Oh, my stomach.
I think it's really ready to go now.</i>

499
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,317
<i>Doo Shik is here too.
I'm going nuts.</i>

500
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:22,817
<i>Yes, I have no choice now.</i>

501
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:24,998
<i>I have to jump out.</i>

502
00:26:24,998 --> 00:26:28,752
Doo Shik... I'm sorry to ask.

503
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:30,521
Can you grab the wheel for me?

504
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:34,040
Oh... all right.

505
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,519
Min Su Ah, are you crazy?
What are you doing?

506
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,750
Don't stop me. I think I'm going to
die from stomach pain.

507
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,632
So, you're going to jump out?
You're going to die then.

508
00:26:47,632 --> 00:26:50,121
It doesn't matter if I jump and die.

509
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:53,980
It's the same if I die of embarrassment
if I stay here with you.

510
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,660
- It's better to jump and die.
- What are you saying?

511
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,722
Pull yourself together, Min Su Ah!

512
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:03,411
Don't stop me. Don't stop me.

513
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,817
We... we stopped.

514
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:16,184
Right?

515
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:19,906
We stopped. We're going to live.

516
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,518
We're alive, Su Ah.

517
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:23,780
Doo Shik!

518
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:28,660
Move!

519
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:32,009
- Toilet paper.
- Huh? Oh, toilet paper.

520
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,945
I found it. I found it. I found some.

521
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:40,288
Doo Shik, give me one.

522
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,261
What? There's only one?

523
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:53,333
Doo Shik.

524
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:58,486
No, I can't ever give this to you.

525
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:03,153
This is my last thing
remaining of my human rights.

526
00:28:03,153 --> 00:28:05,290
I'm sorry, Su Ah.

527
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,951
Yes, I wouldn't be able
to give it up either.

528
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:12,463
I understand.

529
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:17,013
You don't need to feel guilty, Doo Shik.

530
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:19,663
I'll do what I have to.

531
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:24,318
I'll find some newspapers or something.

532
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:25,907
Hey, Min Su Ah!

533
00:28:34,154 --> 00:28:36,680
- Doo Shik.
- Take it before I change my mind.

534
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,013
Hurry.

535
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:47,776
What about you?

536
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,948
It's already gone wrong for me.

537
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:58,461
So, hurry up and go.

538
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:02,257
And go far, as far as you can.

539
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:16,909
Doo Shik. I'm sorry,
but I have a favor to ask.

540
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,599
Hey, Min Su Ah.

541
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:26,329
You're asking for too much here.

542
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:30,270
You shouldn't ask these things of me.

543
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,150
You shouldn't ask me.

544
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,625
Doo Shik, it's now!

545
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:51,780
Where is Yoon Ah
when it's getting so late?

546
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,260
What is she always up to
with that guy, Song Hyun Joon?

547
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,541
- Yoon Ah, you're home--
- I'm back.

548
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:02,155
Dong Gu, hello.

549
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:05,393
I can't return your hello.

550
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:08,722
Yoon Ah, why are you back so late?

551
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:11,982
The work here piled up so much
while you were gone.

552
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:14,832
Sorry, I didn't know
this much time had gone by.

553
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:18,972
That's fine. You should get changed
and clean up the kitchen.

554
00:30:18,972 --> 00:30:22,613
Okay, I'll see you
at the academy, Hyun Joon.

555
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:26,671
- Yoon Ah, here.
- Oh, right.

556
00:30:27,262 --> 00:30:28,712
Thank you for the gift.

557
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:31,742
It's nothing.
You even let me hear your cool rap.

558
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,362
I owe you something for that.

559
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:36,136
Thank you. I'll make
good use of the mini oven.

560
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:37,878
See you in class.

561
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:45,730
I'll be going now too.

562
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,817
Wait, wait.

563
00:30:47,817 --> 00:30:51,037
Song Hyun Joon, let's talk.

564
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:52,549
Yes, about what?

565
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:58,156
If Yoon Ah is late getting home,
it has a negative effect on our business.

566
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,557
So, could you please get Yoon Ah
home quickly from now on?

567
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:06,717
She's my employee. You're like a thief.

568
00:31:06,717 --> 00:31:09,056
Are you that nervous?

569
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:12,300
- What?
- You look that way.

570
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,575
I'm the one at a disadvantage,
but you look nervous.

571
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,945
I don't feel so bad about that.

572
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,875
Rest up, then.

573
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:24,251
Look here, what do you mean by that?

574
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:27,071
Where are you going in the middle
of a conversation?

575
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:30,681
What? Am I nervous?

576
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:34,362
Why would I be nervous?

577
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:36,329
I'm not nervous at all.

578
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:39,805
That guy is a joke.

579
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:47,482
Oh, are you home, Joon Ki?

580
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:50,181
Ah, what happened with that commercial?

581
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,496
Well, of course...

582
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:57,941
I didn't get it.

583
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:00,701
Why? I thought it was
practically confirmed.

584
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,770
It just worked out that way.

585
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,590
What do you mean?
There must be a reason.

586
00:32:07,903 --> 00:32:10,061
The thing is...

587
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:15,083
What? How could that happen?
Those terrible people.

588
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,673
What can I do?

589
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:19,479
I have no power, money, or backing,
so I have to let it go.

590
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,574
Stay strong, Joon Ki.
You'll get another chance.

591
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,673
I'm fine.

592
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:28,151
I'm perfectly fine with it.

593
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:31,586
I'm worried my father
will be disappointed.

594
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:34,115
He was so happy.

595
00:32:39,614 --> 00:32:42,832
You were practicing driving
all this time?

596
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:46,244
Why do you look that way, Doo Shik?

597
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:50,403
Isn't that Su Ah's dress?
Why are you wearing that?

598
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:54,094
Yeah. Where are your pants?

599
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:56,536
What the heck did you two do out there?

600
00:32:56,536 --> 00:33:00,557
Don't ask. Don't ask us anything.

601
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,490
Not a thing.

602
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:08,587
Su Ah.

603
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:14,163
I'll wash this and
give it back to you tomorrow.

604
00:33:14,686 --> 00:33:18,332
No, you keep it.

605
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:21,488
How can I wear it?

606
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:23,413
I'm giving it to you.

607
00:33:24,932 --> 00:33:28,250
I'm going to head up first.

608
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:35,528
Joon Ki.

609
00:33:35,528 --> 00:33:40,759
We should just scrap Rebecca
and put her in the junkyard.

610
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:44,482
What do you mean?
Why would I do that to Rebecca?

611
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,842
Don't ask why.

612
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:49,365
Just do as I say.

613
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:52,246
It's for the best.

614
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,519
Hey, what are you saying,
wearing those shaman clothes?

615
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:10,175
Joon Ki, don't be so down.
You can get another commercial.

616
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,250
Yes, Joon Ki.

617
00:34:13,235 --> 00:34:16,318
Have these muffins.
You didn't have breakfast.

618
00:34:16,318 --> 00:34:19,931
No, I have no appetite.

619
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:25,690
Oh, isn't that the commercial
you were going to do?

620
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah, Columbia Espresso.

621
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,123
- Right, Joon Ki?
- I don't know.

622
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:35,010
I don't want to see it.

623
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,768
I'm going to go rest.

624
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:40,135
Huh? What is that?

625
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:46,701
<i>Wake up with a refreshing smile as if
you've had a drink of morning dew.</i>

626
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,313
<i>We roast our coffee beans every morning.</i>

627
00:34:54,579 --> 00:35:00,432
<i>Like the seven colors of the rainbow,
it is abundant in taste and scent.</i>

628
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:06,590
<i>The coffee melts like the warm spring sun
with a smooth, mellow sound.</i>

629
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,630
<i>The time to enjoy a coffee every morning.</i>

630
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,168
<i>Columbia Espresso.</i>

631
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:14,333
What is that?

632
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,577
- Why is a coffee commercial so lame?
- What was that?

633
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:19,396
Yeah, I'm embarrassed watching it.

634
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:21,548
It's better that you didn't do it.

635
00:35:21,548 --> 00:35:23,302
What is that, seriously?

636
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:27,577
So, that guy acted so petty
just to film that commercial?

637
00:35:27,577 --> 00:35:30,139
Yeah, what an embarrassment.

638
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:32,864
What? He's the best looking
coffee bean I've seen.

639
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,688
Refreshing smile like morning dew.

640
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,608
Abundant expressions
like the colors of a rainbow.

641
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:40,481
And a smooth voice like
the morning sun, so perfect!

642
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,594
You're finally smiling? Are you happy?

643
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:44,704
Yes, I'm happy.

644
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:48,940
Gosh, I suddenly have my appetite back.

645
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,050
So good, so good.
It's just so delicious.

646
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:56,282
My goodness.

647
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:58,561
Eat up.

648
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,971
It's just going right in.

649
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:28,349
Hey, what are you doing?

650
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:33,246
Oh, it's been 49 days
since my Olivia died.

651
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:36,483
My poor Olivia.

652
00:36:36,483 --> 00:36:39,603
I hope she's not hurting in Heaven.

653
00:36:39,603 --> 00:36:44,070
Dong Gu, you know
you're as psychotic as I am.

654
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,300
- Right?
- How can you say that?

655
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,025
You made Olivia this way.

656
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:52,039
I told you I'd buy you a better one
when I make money.

657
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:55,913
When will that be?
When will you make money?

658
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:59,041
I want to be a director,
but I have no camera.

659
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:02,581
If I had some other camera,
I wouldn't think of Olivia so much.

660
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:06,121
Will your camera come back to life
if you do that?

661
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:08,206
You think that's why I'm do this?

662
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,882
Joon Ki, I developed
something great. It's awesome!

663
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:12,762
Something great? What?

664
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:14,222
You want to see? Follow me.

665
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:15,853
- What is it?
- Shut up!

666
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:17,918
I'm doing a 49 days after death ceremony.

667
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:37,278
Ready.

668
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:41,197
Go, go!

669
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:47,262
Go, go, go, go, go!

670
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:48,882
Go! Okay.

671
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:50,681
Hey, hey. 3.8 seconds.

672
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:53,313
Awesome. That's a record.

673
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,724
Let me try now. It's my turn.

674
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,197
I'm going.

675
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:13,188
Ready...

676
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:14,489
Go!

677
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:17,945
Go, go, go, go, go!

678
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:24,494
What are you doing?

679
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:32,155
Is it skeleton this time?

680
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:36,166
It's not skeleton. It's sweleton.

681
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,875
- Doo Shik developed it.
- Be quiet!

682
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:40,085
What is this? It's so childish.

683
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,269
- Do you know how old you are?
- 31.

684
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:44,934
You're not a kid. What are you doing?

685
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:47,601
Sorry.

686
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,177
Joon Ki, you know you're supposed to
meet my friends today, right?

687
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:54,400
That was today?

688
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,708
You already forgot?
Hurry up and get ready.

689
00:38:57,708 --> 00:39:00,344
Okay, okay.

690
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:10,416
<i>[No Matter How Much I Think About It,
I Think You...]</i>

691
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:13,648
What do you think?

692
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:17,527
I came here recently
and the food was very good.

693
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:19,307
Oh, it's really good.

694
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:21,429
Thanks to you, my mouth is happy.

695
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:22,610
It's nothing.

696
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,769
Seo Jin was always talking up
her boyfriend, so I was curious.

697
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:29,378
You are very handsome,
just as I heard.

698
00:39:29,378 --> 00:39:30,748
Oh, thank you.

699
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:34,701
Though, I always hear that.

700
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:36,559
You have a sense of humor too.

701
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,369
Hey, you must be happy.

702
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:39,755
Well, you know.

703
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:43,635
Oh, right. Ji Young's boyfriend
here is a potter.

704
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:45,173
A potter?

705
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:47,206
So, you're an artist?

706
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:50,427
You should come to my workshop
when I have time. I'll show you around.

707
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:53,847
- Oh, okay.
- We're grateful for the invite.

708
00:39:53,847 --> 00:39:55,690
I heard you're an actor, Joon Ki.

709
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,670
You're in the drama "Newsroom," right?

710
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,596
Yes.

711
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:03,777
What else have you been in besides that?

712
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,724
Perhaps, this...

713
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:08,639
Octopus ink...

714
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,708
Octopus ink

715
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,090
gun!

716
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:14,690
Bang, bang, bang.

717
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,224
Ah, I got it. That children's drama.

718
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:19,536
You were very fun in that.

719
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:23,065
Oh no. I'm not that fun of a person.

720
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:24,840
You're mistaken.

721
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,500
- You are so funny.
- You really are.

722
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,420
Then should I show you one more thing?

723
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,527
One more?

724
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:42,192
That is so funny!

725
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:46,532
Seo Jin, what is it?

726
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:48,811
Did I do something wrong?

727
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,893
Do you really not know?

728
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:52,099
What did I do?

729
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,018
Why are you like that, Joon Ki?

730
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,768
Why do you keep acting silly
in front of my friends?

731
00:40:56,768 --> 00:40:59,878
Because it's awkward.
I'm trying to make the mood better.

732
00:40:59,878 --> 00:41:02,190
Why is it you who's trying
to make the mood better?

733
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,820
Is it your job to entertain them?

734
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,432
Why are you always joking around?
Can't you be an adult?

735
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,217
Sorry.

736
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,922
I'll be careful in the future.

737
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:13,829
Don't be careful.

738
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:15,597
Can't you just stop completely?

739
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:18,168
Don't do it at all?

740
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:21,003
That's a bit...

741
00:41:21,003 --> 00:41:24,894
Then I'll only do it at home.
That's okay, right?

742
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,351
Okay, okay. I won't do it.

743
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,869
I won't joke around anymore.

744
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:32,101
Satisfied?

745
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,403
You mean it? You promise?

746
00:41:37,072 --> 00:41:38,967
I said okay.

747
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:43,262
You are so adorable.

748
00:41:49,782 --> 00:41:52,965
Oh! Wow.

749
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:54,677
So, it does fit inside.

750
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:58,786
Wow, it actually does go inside.

751
00:41:58,786 --> 00:42:02,617
Why are you two arriving together?

752
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:05,699
Oh, we met out front.

753
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:07,547
We ran into each other.

754
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,710
- Really?
- Yes.

755
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,590
Joon Ki, Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

756
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,452
Joon Ki, what took you so long?
I was waiting for you.

757
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,793
Let's play some sweleton.

758
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:21,132
Sweleton? That sounds fun.

759
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,804
My throat hurts.

760
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:34,365
Doo Shik, I'm sorry.
I can't do that with you anymore.

761
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:37,014
What? Why not?

762
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:41,244
Anyway, I'm not going to
do that stuff anymore.

763
00:42:41,244 --> 00:42:43,161
Do it alone.

764
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:47,606
Joon Ki, Joon Ki.

765
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,157
Joon Ki, why are you being this way?
Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

766
00:42:50,157 --> 00:42:51,635
What is it?

767
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,297
Yoon Ah, you're still here.

768
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:08,230
Yes, I just wanted to finish these.

769
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,126
Really? Oh, yeah.

770
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:13,807
I have something to give you, Yoon Ah.

771
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,021
Take this.

772
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:18,527
What is it?

773
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:22,675
The profits from your muffin sales.
It's not a lot or anything.

774
00:43:23,382 --> 00:43:25,764
What are you doing? Take it.

775
00:43:25,764 --> 00:43:29,211
I don't know if
it's something I can take.

776
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:32,603
You earned the money.
Of course, you should take it.

777
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:35,831
Hurry up and take it.
My arm is going to fall off.

778
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:38,409
Oh, it's falling.
The money is falling to the floor.

779
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,614
Thank you. Thank you so much.

780
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,056
Joon Ki, let's play sweleton just once.

781
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:03,056
I told you I'm not doing it.

782
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:07,112
Are you really doing this?
Why are you suddenly being this way?

783
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:10,507
I told you I'm not playing
those games anymore.

784
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,811
You're being too harsh.
You've changed, Joon Ki.

785
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,010
I'm home.

786
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,771
You're home, Yoon Ah?

787
00:44:29,315 --> 00:44:30,396
What is all of that?

788
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:32,405
I got my profits for the muffin sales.

789
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:35,521
So, I bought presents for everyone.

790
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,025
What do you think? Do you like them?

791
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,445
Yes, I like it.

792
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:58,858
I'll wear it every day.

793
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:05,360
I've always wanted an elephant hat.

794
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,487
Thank you, Yoon Ah.

795
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:09,117
Yeah.

796
00:45:09,827 --> 00:45:12,208
I was looking for
a Princess Mimi hand mirror.

797
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,369
How did you know?

798
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:17,914
I like mine too, Yoon Ah,
but what is it?

799
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:20,054
Where do I use it? My cheeks?

800
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:23,485
It's a shaving brush
used to apply shaving cream.

801
00:45:23,485 --> 00:45:25,443
Shaving brush?

802
00:45:25,443 --> 00:45:30,967
It's made out of badger fur,
so the cream applies nicely.

803
00:45:31,702 --> 00:45:33,161
Really?

804
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:37,981
I'm so excited thinking about applying
shaving cream with badger fur.

805
00:45:39,184 --> 00:45:41,222
I knew you would all like them.

806
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:44,681
Honestly, I have
a good sense for buying gifts.

807
00:45:47,106 --> 00:45:50,125
Is Dong Gu still in his room?

808
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,489
I bought a present for him too.

809
00:45:54,954 --> 00:45:57,922
What do you think? Do you like it?

810
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,353
What?

811
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,324
Yes, I happen to like baby chicks.

812
00:46:03,324 --> 00:46:05,949
I don't even eat chicken often.

813
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:08,644
I knew you would like it.

814
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:11,425
Oh, yeah. Do you have
time tomorrow, Dong Gu?

815
00:46:11,425 --> 00:46:13,387
Time? Why do you ask?

816
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:16,516
Just because,
I'm thankful to you for so much.

817
00:46:16,516 --> 00:46:18,128
I wanted to buy you a meal.

818
00:46:18,128 --> 00:46:19,536
A meal?

819
00:46:19,536 --> 00:46:22,766
Oh... there's really no need for that.

820
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:25,219
When, where, and what time
should I see you?

821
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,400
How embarrassing.

822
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,108
I'm not a little kid.
What's with the baby chick?

823
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:46,335
Still, Yoon Ah bought it for me.
I had to wear it here.

824
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:47,775
Dong Gu.

825
00:46:47,775 --> 00:46:50,576
Oh, Yoon Ah. You're here.

826
00:46:50,576 --> 00:46:53,110
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

827
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,851
Oh, you wore that shirt?

828
00:46:56,851 --> 00:47:00,373
Yes, I liked it so much
that I had to wear it.

829
00:47:01,425 --> 00:47:03,251
What should we eat, then?

830
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:04,811
One moment.

831
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:08,532
That's strange.
He should be here by now.

832
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:11,320
Here? Is someone else coming?

833
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,742
Yoon Ah!

834
00:47:13,422 --> 00:47:15,106
Hyun Joon.

835
00:47:25,056 --> 00:47:26,635
What are you doing here?

836
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,396
Dong Gu, what are you doing here?

837
00:47:28,396 --> 00:47:33,295
I was on my way to meet Dong Gu and
Hyun Joon called asking to eat together.

838
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:35,856
I thought it would be nice
if we all ate together.

839
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:37,335
- That's okay, right?
- Yes.

840
00:47:37,335 --> 00:47:39,822
Ah, yes.

841
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:41,574
What are you doing in that shirt?

842
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:45,833
Ah, the shirt was so nice
that I bought one for Hyun Joon too.

843
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:49,182
I didn't think you would both
come out wearing it.

844
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:52,059
You must both really like it.

845
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:55,547
Of course, we like it.

846
00:47:55,547 --> 00:47:59,469
Yes, you don't know
how much we like it.

847
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:00,958
Shall we go eat now?

848
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,302
Let's do that.

849
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:06,054
Why would you wear that here?

850
00:48:13,503 --> 00:48:16,063
Oh my. What are you doing?

851
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:18,494
- Hey.
- Let's go talk.

852
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:20,387
Let me go.

853
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:26,643
Why are you grabbing my arm
when people are watching?

854
00:48:26,643 --> 00:48:30,634
Why is it that you are
sitting next to Yoon Ah?

855
00:48:30,634 --> 00:48:32,385
I was just sitting.

856
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:34,485
One of us have to sit next to her.

857
00:48:34,485 --> 00:48:37,460
But why would that be you,
Hyun Joon?

858
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,849
What do you want to do?

859
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,751
Hyun Joon, we may be rivals in love

860
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:45,123
but let's be men and have fair play.

861
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,717
Fair play?

862
00:48:51,657 --> 00:48:54,338
I'll be treating you both today,
so eat lots.

863
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:56,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

864
00:48:59,947 --> 00:49:01,650
I got a call.

865
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,643
I'll be out for a moment
to take this call.

866
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:05,065
- What?
- What?

867
00:49:06,608 --> 00:49:09,192
This is a funny image...

868
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,032
Ah, so embarrassing.

869
00:49:19,032 --> 00:49:22,385
Hey, would you
get away from me a bit?

870
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:23,759
There's not enough room.

871
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:26,115
Do your best.

872
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:34,130
This is a piece that I created.
I was influenced by Peter Voulkos.

873
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,219
Oh.

874
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:38,393
I tried to show
Korea's beauty in abstract.

875
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,280
Ah, I see.

876
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,460
Would you like to see that too?

877
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,769
Yes.

878
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:45,150
Seo Jin.

879
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:48,592
<i>I don't know. I cannot know.</i>

880
00:49:48,592 --> 00:49:50,293
That was Uhm Jung Hwa, right.

881
00:49:50,293 --> 00:49:51,664
- Put them down.
- Yes.

882
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,974
I told you not to joke around.

883
00:49:55,655 --> 00:49:56,960
Sorry.

884
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,014
What are you doing here alone?

885
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:33,882
Just...

886
00:50:33,882 --> 00:50:36,844
It's not fun to play alone.

887
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:40,135
I want to play sweleton.

888
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:43,786
Should I do it with you?

889
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:45,835
Really?

890
00:51:01,396 --> 00:51:03,199
How was I? I'm pretty good, aren't I?

891
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:05,018
- Should I try again?
- No.

892
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:07,422
Never mind. Let's stop.

893
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:09,559
It's not fun at all with you.

894
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:11,333
What? Why not?

895
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:15,402
You don't have that
special something like Joon Ki.

896
00:51:15,402 --> 00:51:17,722
There is no excitement!

897
00:51:17,722 --> 00:51:19,862
What? Excitement?

898
00:51:19,862 --> 00:51:22,612
Who needs excitement
to ride this dumb thing?

899
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,222
What? "Dumb thing"?

900
00:51:25,222 --> 00:51:26,985
Are you done?

901
00:51:28,682 --> 00:51:30,277
What?

902
00:51:30,277 --> 00:51:34,081
Forget it. This is why you can't do it.

903
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,402
You...

904
00:51:37,965 --> 00:51:41,568
I played with him because
he looked bored, so what's this?

905
00:51:46,034 --> 00:51:48,891
Ah, did you enjoy your meal?

906
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:51,356
Yes, it was really delicious.

907
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:54,407
It would've been better
without someone here.

908
00:51:55,751 --> 00:51:58,376
I enjoyed it too.

909
00:51:58,376 --> 00:52:00,996
I feel the same way.

910
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:05,568
It's a bicycle.

911
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:08,684
Oh, that looks fun.

912
00:52:08,684 --> 00:52:10,543
Yoon Ah, you want to ride a bike?

913
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:13,152
I suddenly want to
after seeing other people riding it.

914
00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:15,322
- Then I will--
- You can ride it, then.

915
00:52:15,322 --> 00:52:17,025
I'll go rent them.

916
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,155
Here, Hyun Joon.

917
00:52:29,155 --> 00:52:30,414
Yoon Ah, let's go.

918
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:31,860
Okay.

919
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:39,606
Why am I on the single-rider bicycle?

920
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:42,972
All the other ones are gone
and this is the only one left.

921
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:47,056
So, you and Yoon Ah
will ride the two-seater bicycle?

922
00:52:47,056 --> 00:52:50,463
- Yes.
- I thought you wanted fair play.

923
00:52:50,463 --> 00:52:52,989
Then, what do you want to do?

924
00:52:57,384 --> 00:53:00,273
Is this really necessary?

925
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:05,661
It was you who insisted on fair play.

926
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:09,586
Forget it. Just pedal away.

927
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:15,706
So embarrassing.

928
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,498
Hey, what are you doing there?

929
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:23,146
Why are you putting your face on my back?

930
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:24,472
Let's just go like this.

931
00:53:24,472 --> 00:53:27,784
People are getting the wrong idea.
You're really strange.

932
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:30,280
- Seriously.
- Just go.

933
00:53:34,556 --> 00:53:36,606
Thank you for inviting us today.

934
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:37,655
It was fun.

935
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:39,898
I'll invite you to my exhibition
next time. Please come.

936
00:53:39,898 --> 00:53:42,925
I'll be there for sure. Just invite me.

937
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:45,356
How is your job as a reporter going?

938
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:47,213
It is so hectic.

939
00:53:47,213 --> 00:53:50,380
I never imagined
that it was such a hard job.

940
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,568
- Is it very hard?
- Yes.

941
00:53:52,568 --> 00:53:55,331
By the way, how long
have you two been dating?

942
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:11,900
What's wrong, Joon Ki?

943
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,153
My teeth, ouch.

944
00:54:14,153 --> 00:54:15,826
What about your teeth?

945
00:54:19,108 --> 00:54:22,144
What is that? Did your tooth fall out?

946
00:54:22,862 --> 00:54:27,260
It's not my tooth.

947
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,679
It's a pine nut. It's a pine nut.

948
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,547
What was that? You really shocked me.

949
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:37,012
Joon Ki, you really are funny.

950
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:39,452
That was funny, right? That was fun.

951
00:54:39,452 --> 00:54:42,853
It was actually a pine nut.
That was fun, right?

952
00:54:42,853 --> 00:54:44,791
Pine nut, pine nut.

953
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,873
<i>Joon Ki, what's wrong?</i>

954
00:54:47,873 --> 00:54:49,882
Why are you smiling away like that?

955
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:55,643
Oh, it's nothing.

956
00:54:55,643 --> 00:54:57,385
I feel loved.

957
00:54:57,385 --> 00:55:00,666
I envy you. I'm in a loving relationship.

958
00:55:03,898 --> 00:55:06,938
Ah, that was good.

959
00:55:06,938 --> 00:55:10,797
It's been a long time since I rode a
bike and had a beer so I feel good.

960
00:55:10,797 --> 00:55:12,737
You're right.

961
00:55:12,737 --> 00:55:15,934
It would've been better
if someone weren't here.

962
00:55:17,938 --> 00:55:21,358
You should ride a bike every now
and then and drink beer, Yoon Ah.

963
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:22,858
Okay.

964
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:26,300
Just the two of us.

965
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,018
Sorry, but I'll be in the restroom.

966
00:55:29,018 --> 00:55:30,621
Yes, okay.

967
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:40,592
Yes, thank you to coming
to our store, everyone.

968
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:46,030
You all know that today is our
first anniversary since opening, right?

969
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:47,592
Yes!

970
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:52,681
As we have promised,
we have a big prize on the line

971
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:56,009
and we will start a couple's event!

972
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:58,625
Gosh, it's noisy.

973
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:01,045
They do all kinds of things at a bar.

974
00:56:01,045 --> 00:56:04,007
Yes, I just want a beer in a quiet place.

975
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:08,878
To the couple that wins first place...

976
00:56:08,878 --> 00:56:13,998
they will win the newest DSLR camera!

977
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:17,329
The prize is that camera?

978
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:22,574
Couples interested in the event,
please come forward.

979
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:24,661
I have to enter that.

980
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:27,701
Why isn't Yoon Ah coming?
Where is she?

981
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:28,775
Why?

982
00:56:28,775 --> 00:56:30,947
You're going to enter
the couple's event with Yoon Ah?

983
00:56:30,947 --> 00:56:34,431
Yes, actually I really need that camera.

984
00:56:34,431 --> 00:56:36,289
Still, that's against the rules.

985
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:38,681
Who said you can enter
that event with Yoon Ah?

986
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:40,920
This has no meaning.

987
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,552
It's about the camera.

988
00:56:42,552 --> 00:56:44,425
Please understand this once, okay?

989
00:56:44,425 --> 00:56:48,463
Only 30 seconds left to enter.

990
00:56:48,463 --> 00:56:51,228
Yoon Ah is still not back.
What do I do?

991
00:56:51,228 --> 00:56:53,163
She won't be back.

992
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,099
Wait.

993
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:02,349
What? Why are you looking at me
with those eyes?

994
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:06,260
Hyun Joon, can you enter
the couple's event with me?

995
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,442
What did you say?

996
00:57:07,442 --> 00:57:09,992
Dong Gu, are you crazy
to suggest such nonsense?

997
00:57:09,992 --> 00:57:12,101
Hyun Joon, are you really
going to be this way?

998
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:16,753
We may be rivals in love,
but you can do a couple's event with me.

999
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:21,253
Still, that doesn't make sense.

1000
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:23,490
I really need that camera.

1001
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:26,126
I really need the camera, Hyun Joon.

1002
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:27,313
10.

1003
00:57:28,536 --> 00:57:29,778
9.

1004
00:57:30,565 --> 00:57:33,483
- I still don't know about this.
- 8.

1005
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:38,077
- Okay, next time we ride a bike...
- 7.

1006
00:57:38,077 --> 00:57:40,829
- I'll give you the two-seater.
- 6.

1007
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:41,978
Really?

1008
00:57:41,978 --> 00:57:44,117
- Can I sit next to Yoon Ah too?
- 5.

1009
00:57:44,117 --> 00:57:45,291
What?

1010
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:47,597
- Aren't you being too greedy?
- Forget it, then.

1011
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,068
3.

1012
00:57:49,068 --> 00:57:51,585
Deal, but the deal is off
if we don't win first place.

1013
00:57:51,585 --> 00:57:53,239
- 2.
- Deal!

1014
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:54,775
1!

1015
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:56,498
Us!

1016
00:57:56,498 --> 00:58:00,583
The team that lasts the longest
will win first place.

1017
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:03,914
They will win the newest model
DSLR camera.

1018
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:06,769
Everyone, hold on. Hold on.

1019
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:09,034
Hyun Joon, are you okay?

1020
00:58:09,034 --> 00:58:11,311
Yes, I am.

1021
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:15,414
I'll hold on even if it kills me,
so stay strong, Dong Gu.

1022
00:58:15,414 --> 00:58:19,302
I'll hold on even it breaks my legs.

1023
00:58:19,302 --> 00:58:22,798
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

1024
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:32,119
Oh, Dong Gu. You're sweating.

1025
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:33,349
Thank you.

1026
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:34,820
Yes.

1027
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,039
We have to win!

1028
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:39,994
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

1029
00:58:41,534 --> 00:58:44,186
Oh, where did everyone go?

1030
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:46,568
Why am I so hungry?

1031
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:48,887
Joon Ki, should we make ramen?

1032
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:51,331
I don't have much of an appetite.

1033
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:53,362
I'm going to go rest.

1034
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:55,603
Oh, okay.

1035
00:59:00,195 --> 00:59:01,597
Joon Ki.

1036
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:06,489
Let's go.

1037
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:49,934
<i>Hey, hey. 3.8 seconds.</i>

1038
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:52,936
<i>Awesome. It's a record.</i>

1039
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:54,297
Fise.

1040
00:59:54,297 --> 00:59:56,996
Fise, Fise, Fise.

1041
00:59:56,996 --> 00:59:58,856
Should I feed you
or do you want to come here?

1042
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:00,246
Joon Ki, kiss me.

1043
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:02,204
Oh my god!

1044
01:00:07,143 --> 01:00:10,458
- Ouch.
- Sorry, I'm new here.

1045
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:13,507
What are we doing here?
How long do we have to do this?

1046
01:00:13,507 --> 01:00:15,115
<i>It's okay. Don't cry.</i>

1047
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:18,782
<i>Why are you crying?
Be optimistic about it.</i>

1048
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:22,496
Awesome!

1049
01:00:56,197 --> 01:00:58,739
What is it? What's wrong with Dong Gu?

1050
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:01,789
Dong Gu fell into exhaustion.

1051
01:01:01,789 --> 01:01:05,090
Exhaustion? What did he do?

1052
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,028
There was something that happened.

1053
01:01:07,028 --> 01:01:10,929
Yoon Ah, I'm going to put Dong Gu in bed.

1054
01:01:10,929 --> 01:01:13,248
Okay, I'll get some water.

1055
01:01:13,248 --> 01:01:14,481
Yes.

1056
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:27,949
Matilda, Matilda...

1057
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:30,565
Then I'm Leon.

1058
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:34,307
What are you doing here? Go now.

1059
01:01:34,307 --> 01:01:38,347
Aren't you being too severe?

1060
01:01:38,347 --> 01:01:42,762
I carried you here and I'm the one
who helped you win the camera.

1061
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:46,161
Shouldn't you say thank you, at least?

1062
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:49,181
Thank you, yeah right.

1063
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:51,972
It was my first date with Yoon Ah.

1064
01:01:51,972 --> 01:01:55,101
It was all ruined because of you.

1065
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:56,731
Look who's talking.

1066
01:01:56,731 --> 01:01:59,762
Seriously, this guy.

1067
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:02,197
Tell me now, Yoon Ah.

1068
01:02:02,197 --> 01:02:04,170
Tell me.

1069
01:02:05,706 --> 01:02:08,077
What is that about?

1070
01:02:08,077 --> 01:02:12,474
They're like a couple on a honeymoon.
When did they get so friendly?

1071
01:02:17,972 --> 01:02:19,798
Goodness...

1072
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:23,731
<i>What about Dong Gu?
Is he still sleeping?</i>

1073
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:27,231
Yes, he's still hugging Hyun Joon
and sleeping.

1074
01:02:27,851 --> 01:02:30,396
They'll end up being best friends.

1075
01:02:30,396 --> 01:02:33,016
They wouldn't be
in that relationship, otherwise.

1076
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:35,157
Why? What do you mean?

1077
01:02:35,157 --> 01:02:38,018
What? Nothing.

1078
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:41,786
Joon Ki, you should eat. Sit down.

1079
01:02:41,786 --> 01:02:43,306
Ah, yes.

1080
01:02:46,753 --> 01:02:48,275
Doo Shik.

1081
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:57,998
What's wrong with your face?

1082
01:02:57,998 --> 01:03:00,322
Are you sick? You don't look so good.

1083
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:02,815
Yeah, is something wrong?

1084
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:05,838
No, I'm all right.

1085
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:16,262
Joon Ki, what is it? Wake up!

1086
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,532
We examined him.

1087
01:03:19,532 --> 01:03:21,590
His liver somatic index
and blood pressure is high.

1088
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,445
All the results are bad.

1089
01:03:23,445 --> 01:03:26,943
- Strangely, we don't know the cause.
- What?

1090
01:03:26,943 --> 01:03:28,934
What do you mean,
you don't know the cause?

1091
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:32,184
A person who was fine yesterday
can't become this way in one day.

1092
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:34,875
Usually, it can be
caused by severe stress.

1093
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:39,565
Did Lee Joon Ki suffer
a big trauma recently?

1094
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,978
Ah, there is one thing.

1095
01:03:41,978 --> 01:03:45,197
- What is it?
- He really likes to joke around.

1096
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:47,197
I didn't allow him to.

1097
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:50,204
Now that I think about it,
he stopped talking and seemed weak after.

1098
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:51,445
That's what I think.

1099
01:03:51,445 --> 01:03:53,797
That was the trauma. I'm sure of it.

1100
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:58,306
What? How can not letting someone
joke around make a person sick?

1101
01:03:58,306 --> 01:04:01,759
It's not common,
but that has to be the cause.

1102
01:04:01,759 --> 01:04:06,447
Joking around and being silly could
have been everything in his life.

1103
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:10,030
Everything is his life? Joking around?

1104
01:04:14,527 --> 01:04:16,449
You're here?

1105
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,887
What did they say? Am I very sick?

1106
01:04:21,887 --> 01:04:25,275
Yes, you could even die.

1107
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:26,619
What?

1108
01:04:27,295 --> 01:04:29,487
They can't treat me?

1109
01:04:29,487 --> 01:04:31,501
There's no hope with surgery?

1110
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:34,677
No, you'll get better
once you start joking around.

1111
01:04:34,677 --> 01:04:36,487
What?

1112
01:04:36,487 --> 01:04:37,737
What does that mean?

1113
01:04:37,737 --> 01:04:40,197
They said you're sick
because I didn't let you joke around.

1114
01:04:40,197 --> 01:04:44,119
So, live your life making jokes
and being silly all you want.

1115
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:46,967
I can really do that?

1116
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:50,211
You could die otherwise.
What can I do?

1117
01:04:50,211 --> 01:04:52,914
So, do whatever you want... make jokes.

1118
01:04:52,914 --> 01:04:56,338
Seo Jin, thank you. Thank you so much.

1119
01:04:56,338 --> 01:05:00,911
There was something
I wanted to do for a while.

1120
01:05:00,911 --> 01:05:02,059
May I do it?

1121
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:03,833
Do it. Do it all you want.

1122
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,188
Yes!

1123
01:05:08,885 --> 01:05:11,532
Seo Jin, look at me.
Don't I look like I'm flying?

1124
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,143
Woohoo!

1125
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:16,936
<i>Spread my wings!</i>

1126
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,628
Seo Jin, try it on the other side.

1127
01:05:24,188 --> 01:05:26,226
I'm flying.

1128
01:05:32,686 --> 01:05:34,565
Try eating this.

1129
01:05:34,565 --> 01:05:36,911
You haven't eaten all day.

1130
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:39,724
I have no appetite.

1131
01:05:39,724 --> 01:05:42,800
What's with you lately?
Is something wrong?

1132
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,809
I don't know. I just feel weak.

1133
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,920
I have no appetite either.

1134
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:52,112
Doo Shik!

1135
01:05:57,139 --> 01:05:58,690
Joon Ki.

1136
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,929
Doo Shik, I'm sorry about before.

1137
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:03,628
You resented me, right?

1138
01:06:03,628 --> 01:06:07,260
What is it? Are you back now, Joon Ki?

1139
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,527
The Joon Ki that I know?

1140
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:14,818
It's for real, right?

1141
01:06:14,818 --> 01:06:16,021
It's real, Joon Ki?

1142
01:06:16,021 --> 01:06:17,759
I'm telling you it is.

1143
01:06:17,759 --> 01:06:21,565
Doo Shik, shall we do some sweleton
since we couldn't all that time?

1144
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:23,507
Let's go!

1145
01:06:24,382 --> 01:06:26,556
Let's go do it!

1146
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:31,414
Oh yeah. I upgraded the sweleton.

1147
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:33,210
Want to try it?

1148
01:06:34,483 --> 01:06:36,353
Let's go do it!

1149
01:06:36,353 --> 01:06:38,074
Let's go do the upgrade!

1150
01:06:38,074 --> 01:06:40,677
- If it's with you.
- If it's with you, Joon Ki.

1151
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:44,076
Oh yeah. I was going to give this to you.

1152
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:00,208
Okay, I'm going now.

1153
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:01,751
Ready.

1154
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:04,690
Go.

1155
01:07:13,965 --> 01:07:16,025
Did you see that?
They all fell over.

1156
01:07:16,025 --> 01:07:17,905
This is a swel-strike!

1157
01:07:17,905 --> 01:07:20,096
The highest score in swel-bowling.

1158
01:07:20,096 --> 01:07:22,396
If you get a swel-strike two times,
that's a swel-double.

1159
01:07:22,396 --> 01:07:24,525
If you get it three times,
swel-turkey.

1160
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,648
Oh, that's awesome.

1161
01:07:26,648 --> 01:07:28,936
- I want to try.
- Come on.

1162
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,318
Here. It's your turn.

1163
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:35,626
I'll go put the pins up.

1164
01:07:35,626 --> 01:07:37,974
- I'll get it ready.
- Thank you.

1165
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:46,465
Su Ah, why are guys like this?

1166
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:51,594
They don't understand
why we go crazy about shopping.

1167
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:55,300
So, just give up.

1168
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:06,954
Swel-strike!

1169
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:19,890

I think you...</i>

<i>Joking?</i>

1179
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:53,220
<i>I like the house
and the interior is pretty.</i>

1180
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,341
<i>What... what is this smell?</i>

1181
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:57,091
<i>Is it his shoes?</i>

1182
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,900
<i>This rotten smell
is coming from his feet?</i>

1183
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,411
<i>Do I have to film with him?</i>

1184
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:02,948

1185
01:09:02,948 --> 01:09:06,962
<i>I told you that I don't want to be
indebted to you whatsoever.</i>

1186
01:09:06,962 --> 01:09:08,815
<i>Yoon Ah, do you have time this weekend?</i>

1187
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:11,514
<i>I need to tell you something.</i>

1188
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:12,572
<i>What did you say?</i>

1189
01:09:12,572 --> 01:09:14,212
<i>- Hyun Joon.
- What brings you here?</i>

1190
01:09:14,212 --> 01:09:15,570
<i>Lend me some money.</i>

1191
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:18,042
<i>- What's wrong?
- Yoon Ah got into an accident.</i>

1192
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:20,162
<i>I'll get it right away. Follow me.</i>
