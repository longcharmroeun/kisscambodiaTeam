1
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:13,925
I was...

2
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:19,325
a little moved by you today.

3
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:23,295
Don't even talk about it.

4
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:27,505
It was a really important interview for you today, wasn't it?

5
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:31,705
So, please get into the company.

6
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:33,005
Okay?

7
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,545
You know what?

8
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:37,675
When I saw you today,

9
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:41,545
my heart fluttered.

10
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:43,755
Why do you think so?

11
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:45,655
I must be crazy.

12
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,525
Let me see.

13
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:49,955
Let go. What are you doing?

14
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:51,925
Let me take a look.

15
00:00:57,435 --> 00:00:59,935
I don't understand.

16
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:03,805
Why did I think that you looked handsome?

17
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,165
Gosh.

18
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:33,330
Dong Gu, what are you doing here?

19
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:35,005
I couldn't fall asleep.

20
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,375
Why do you look so down?

21
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,745
You asked me...

22
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,245
if I was ready to deal with Yoon Ah's issues.

23
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:49,515
But I can't seem to answer that question.

24
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,855
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

25
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:55,025
Of course. It can't be easy.

26
00:01:57,995 --> 00:01:59,320
Do you want to drink?

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,425
I was going to drink my problems away.

28
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:03,025
Sounds good.

29
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:05,165
Let's do that.

30
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:07,105
Let's go.

31
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,045
Take off your shoes.

32
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:19,100
Don't do this.

33
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,385
We're almost there.

34
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,615
Gosh.

35
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:29,825
Hey, get up.

36
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:32,150
- We're almost there. - Let go of me.

37
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,720
I want to drink more.

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,465
- Come here. - I'm going to.

39
00:02:35,935 --> 00:02:38,760
Don't go there. Come with me.

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,200
I want to drink more.

41
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,165
I want to drink more!

42
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:45,875
Gosh.

43
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,045
My goodness.

44
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:49,470
Are you okay?

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,045
What is this?

46
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:59,385
This is Dong Gu's camera.

47
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:02,955
Seo Jin, what should I do?

48
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,695
I broke Dong Gu's camera.

49
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:08,695
What should I do?

50
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,635
No.

51
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,990
Don't throw up here.

52
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,590
Go to the bathroom.

53
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,805
(My Love, Olivia)

54
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,575
Gosh, I'm feeling terrible.

55
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:28,515
My stomach aches.

56
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:31,180
Why did you drink so much?

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,915
Don't talk to me. I'm tired.

58
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:34,925
Soo Ah.

59
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,685
You drink too much.

60
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:39,955
Hello. Yes, detective.

61
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,395
Have you found that con man?

62
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:43,595
Not yet?

63
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:46,465
All right.

64
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:50,935
Gosh, he keeps telling me to wait.

65
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,370
They still haven't found that con man called Yoon Seok?

66
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,545
No.

67
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:58,875
Where could he be hiding?

68
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,070
Once he's caught, I'll...

69
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,385
Don't worry. He'll be caught soon.

70
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:06,285
Du Shik, are you all right?

71
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,155
Since Mal Geum left.

72
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:12,655
I'm all right.

73
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:14,695
It's a good opportunity for her.

74
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,965
I'm happy for her.

75
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,470
Also, I have to start writing Web fictions again.

76
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:22,265
I don't even have the time to think about her.

77
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:25,730
Web fictions? I thought you were finished.

78
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,470
But my fans have been begging me to write...

79
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,645
"President Is Bruce Lee Season 2".

80
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,415
Season 2?

81
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:35,840
Wasn't the story about the US president defeating aliens?

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,815
I wanted to take a little break,

83
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:41,625
but as a writer, I couldn't turn away from my fans' request.

84
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,995
I have to go to work now.

85
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:48,525
Season 2?

86
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:50,565
Open your mouth.

87
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,735
There you go.

88
00:04:57,245 --> 00:05:00,070
You all seemed to drink last night, so I made dried pollack soup.

89
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:01,275
Really?

90
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:06,945
Gosh, that was nice.

91
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,145
Dong Gu, try the soup.

92
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,985
Okay. Thank you.

93
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:13,085
Here.

94
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,255
Are Seo Jin and Jun Ki still sleeping?

95
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,590
They seemed to drink a lot last night.

96
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,035
They fight all the time, but they seem to be inseparable.

97
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,465
Perhaps, they'll grow on each other.

98
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,200
What? Going out?

99
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,730
What awful idea is that?

100
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,805
Seo Jin is my precious sister.

101
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:36,575
She deserves much more than that good-for-nothing.

102
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,245
- What's so wrong about Jun Ki? - What?

103
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:42,015
I'm not saying he is a bad person.

104
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:44,840
But I know every single thing about him.

105
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,085
He is not good enough for my sister.

106
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:49,880
Don't say such an absurd thing again, okay?

107
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,325
Gosh.

108
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,195
My head aches.

109
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:58,560
What's going on? Why did you drink together last night?

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,990
Where and when did you finish?

111
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,070
Whatever.

112
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:03,600
Seo Jin, what time did we get home last night?

113
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:06,305
I blacked out. I don't remember everything.

114
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:10,270
I blacked out too. I remember only some parts.

115
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,370
You blacked out?

116
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,440
We started drinking soju around 7pm.

117
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,710
After that, we ordered some beer.

118
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,440
And then, we had noodles with sea snails.

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,310
We were going to finish with fish cake soup and makgeolli.

120
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,410
But the owner of the place...

121
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,990
gave us some tofu kimchi for free, so we ordered some more soju.

122
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,065
We started drinking soju and...

123
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:37,805
What? What did we do?

124
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,030
Hold on.

125
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,905
I want to drink more.

126
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,740
What is it? What's going on?

127
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,485
Did something happen between you two?

128
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:54,325
No, nothing happened.

129
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:57,420
What could have happened?

130
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,460
I'll go take a shower.

131
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:01,325
I want to get some more sleep.

132
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,785
Gosh, it wasn't a dream.

133
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:27,525
It really happened.

134
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:31,955
Dong Gu will go crazy when he finds out.

135
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:44,235
I must have been crazy.

136
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,275
Why?

137
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:47,830
Why?

138
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,945
Why did I kiss him?

139
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,215
Why?

140
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:56,215
Seo Jin.

141
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:59,155
Do you remember what happened last night?

142
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:02,750
Do you remember it too?

143
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:04,455
Of course, I do.

144
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,595
I can't believe it.

145
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:08,890
What should we do now?

146
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,095
Jun Ki, can we...

147
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:14,030
- just forget about it? - Forget?

148
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,030
How could we forget about it? It already happened.

149
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,930
Why can't we? It'll stay between only you and me.

150
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,945
- What if Dong Gu finds out? - What? Dong Gu?

151
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:25,570
How could he find out? He didn't see it.

152
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,110
Hey, there is no secret in this world.

153
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,245
What are you talking about?

154
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,615
No one saw it. If we stay quiet, no one will find out.

155
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,425
You think so?

156
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:37,625
Yes. So...

157
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:43,125
let's take it to our grave, okay?

158
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,465
Fine.

159
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:49,305
It really doesn't feel right.

160
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,340
Gosh, I must have been crazy.

161
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,145
Why did I kiss him?

162
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:55,645
I blame the alcohol.

163
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,005
Gosh.

164
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:06,085
Why did I break Dong Gu's camera?

165
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:10,955
I blame the alcohol. It's the alcohol's fault.

166
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:18,835
The president died while fighting with aliens in Season 1.

167
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,905
Should I revive him?

168
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:22,965
A zombie.

169
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:25,060
That's right. He becomes a zombie...

170
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,905
and stands up to the aliens again.

171
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,100
"President Is Bruce Lee".

172
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,745
"President Is a Zombie".

173
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:36,245
What a fantastic title.

174
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,040
I'm looking for a ramyeon brand.

175
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,215
Which one?

176
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,195
- That's the name. - What did you...

177
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:49,890
Oh, you mean that Thai ramyeon. It's sold out.

178
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:51,165
I see.

179
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:52,765
Gosh, I was craving it.

180
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:56,670
Soo Ah is already seeing another guy?

181
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:59,635
- What does he do? - He runs a Thai restaurant.

182
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:04,515
Hold on.

183
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,515
Thai...

184
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:17,295
He looked like Soo Ah's ex-boyfriend.

185
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,495
I'll kill him!

186
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:29,505
Did someone just pass by?

187
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:30,805
I think so.

188
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,200
"I'll kill him"?

189
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,405
Dong Gu, I'm sorry, but I have a class to go to.

190
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,130
Can you watch Sol?

191
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,440
Sure.

192
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,600
Thank you.

193
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,045
Sol, your mom has to leave.

194
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:44,440
Thank you.

195
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,380
- See you later. - Okay.

196
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:47,685
See you.

197
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:52,895
I should check the bookings.

198
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:57,090
Who knocked these over?

199
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,265
Gosh.

200
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:01,905
My goodness.

201
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,375
Hold on. Why is my camera on the floor?

202
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:08,945
What happened?

203
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:10,845
What is this?

204
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,800
What happened to my camera?

205
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,845
Who broke it?

206
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:17,755
You did it, didn't you?

207
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:19,880
No.

208
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,855
- It feels so refreshing. - Seo Jin!

209
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,310
Is it you?

210
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,680
You did this, didn't you?

211
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
What do you mean?

212
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,395
I haven't seen your camera.

213
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:32,135
What? It must be Du Shik.

214
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,705
Hello? Bong Du Shik.

215
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:39,175
Did you break my camera?

216
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,575
You didn't? Hang up.

217
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,445
Who did this to my camera?

218
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:49,845
When I catch him, I'll break his back in half.

219
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:55,920
My poor camera.

220
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,225
Who did this?

221
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:00,965
It doesn't work.

222
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,760
Why did I kiss Jun Ki?

223
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,790
Am I insane?

224
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,070
It's true that Jun Ki looked charming at the interview.

225
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:14,370
Still...

226
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,530
Why? Why?

227
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,575
My goodness.

228
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,645
- Seo Jin. - You startled me.

229
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:22,940
You should knock.

230
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,285
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:26,980
I have something to tell you.

232
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:28,685
What is it?

233
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,495
Seo Jin, let's tell Dong Gu...

234
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,020
about what happened last night.

235
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,130
What?

236
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,190
Why do you keep wanting to tell Dong Gu?

237
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,835
Didn't you see Dong Gu?

238
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,970
If Dong Gu finds out later, he'll be furious.

239
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,340
I'm so nervous.

240
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,410
How would Dong Gu find out?

241
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:54,545
Seo Jin, nothing stays as a secret in this world.

242
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:56,480
If he finds out that we didn't tell him,

243
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,840
he might seriously kill us.

244
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,255
Don't you know Dong Gu?

245
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:03,950
Let's confess to him.

246
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,320
Let's say that we confess.

247
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,950
Do you think...

248
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,290
Dong Gu would be understanding?

249
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,760
Once he finds out, you and I are done for.

250
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,565
What?

251
00:13:16,835 --> 00:13:18,430
Why did we do that?

252
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,430
Just delete it from your memory.

253
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,445
No one will ever find out if we keep quiet.

254
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,245
Okay.

255
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:38,220
Why does he want to tell Dong Gu about our kiss?

256
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:39,455
Is he insane?

257
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:43,395
Will he not find out if we don't say anything?

258
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,735
Seo Jin is terrible.

259
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,665
How can she stay quiet after breaking her brother's camera?

260
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:54,605
I'm afraid to meet a woman like her.

261
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:01,140
Detective, will we catch him now that he's caught on...

262
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,415
surveillance camera?

263
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:04,985
I have to wait again?

264
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:07,685
Until when...

265
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:10,755
Hello? Sir?

266
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:15,265
Why does the police always tell me to wait?

267
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:17,665
I can't take it anymore.

268
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:21,005
What are you doing?

269
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,305
I'm going to be on the lookout by myself.

270
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:25,935
What? Can't I do that?

271
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:27,875
You can,

272
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:30,575
but won't he run away if you stay here like this?

273
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:31,975
Would he?

274
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:34,415
What should I do?

275
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:38,315
Gosh, the design looks so cheap.

276
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:39,910
What kind of uniform is this?

277
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,955
What do you expect from a part-time job uniform?

278
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,390
Until when will you be here?

279
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:46,295
Until I catch that jerk.

280
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:47,990
Why? Can't I?

281
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,165
You can.

282
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:52,220
I'll organize the stocks, so stay at the counter.

283
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,435
Okay.

284
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:02,745
Hello.

285
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,275
Give me a coke.

286
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:06,570
Also bring me a chocolate bar.

287
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,315
Pardon me? Why would I do that?

288
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:12,040
Do what the customer says. You talk too much.

289
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,115
What did you say?

290
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:16,525
Why are you ordering me around?

291
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:18,395
Did I upset you?

292
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,760
You're only a part-timer. How dare you be so rude?

293
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:22,025
What?

294
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,725
What did you just say?

295
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:26,195
Hey, stop it.

296
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:28,205
I'm sorry. I'll bring them right now.

297
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:30,165
That's better.

298
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:41,715
- Here you go, sir. - Okay.

299
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:48,925
Here you go.

300
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:57,820
Hey, don't throw it on the floor.

301
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,295
The trash can is over there.

302
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:03,530
Your pay includes cleaning.

303
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,675
Don't you know that?

304
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:06,005
What did you say?

305
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,070
Are you kidding me?

306
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:09,645
What's wrong with you?

307
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:12,145
I'm sorry. It's her first day today.

308
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:14,285
Goodness.

309
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:16,410
I'll let it go for your sake.

310
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:17,685
Do your job properly.

311
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,340
Why you...

312
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,655
Thank you, sir.

313
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:26,280
What's wrong with you?

314
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,565
What did I do? He's the one who was wrong.

315
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:31,120
He's always like that. He owns a barbecue restaurant nearby.

316
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
It's better to avoid him.

317
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,700
Gosh, you're such a pushover.

318
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:37,005
Goodness.

319
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:45,975
Yoon Ah.

320
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,815
Hello.

321
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,355
Wait.

322
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,755
Why do you sound so down? Did something happen?

323
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:58,950
While everyone is doing so well,

324
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,395
I seem to be behind in class.

325
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:03,295
Don't worry so much.

326
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:05,320
You'll catch up if you practice.

327
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,805
I have nowhere else to practice but here.

328
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:11,505
Yoon Ah, do you have time today?

329
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,575
- Come in. - Okay.

330
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:20,500
Why are we at a bakery?

331
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,985
Hello, sir.

332
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,280
Is this your bakery?

333
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,785
Yes. Follow me, Yoon Ah.

334
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:30,125
Okay.

335
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:43,160
What is this place?

336
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,935
It's my workroom.

337
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,405
I create recipes.

338
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,945
I take naps without telling my employees.

339
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:50,275
I see.

340
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,075
Yoon Ah.

341
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:56,170
Can you make the donut that you made in class?

342
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,285
I'll help you.

343
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:58,485
Really?

344
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:00,210
(11,350 dollars)

345
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,085
Why is this camera so expensive?

346
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,995
I don't even have money for myself. Goodness.

347
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:14,635
Dong Gu, did you go somewhere?

348
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,365
I went to repair the camera.

349
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,905
They said that it's too broken to be repaired.

350
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:25,175
My poor Olivia.

351
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:26,415
Olivia?

352
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,315
Who's Olivia?

353
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,045
It's her name.

354
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:35,255
I cared about her more than my real sister.

355
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:39,455
I bought it after working at construction sites for a year.

356
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:44,325
I wiped and took care of her every day.

357
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,835
I was very fond of her.

358
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:51,635
Dong Gu.

359
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:53,805
Are you crying?

360
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:56,875
It's just that...

361
00:18:57,785 --> 00:19:01,485
I feel sad and empty as if my sister died.

362
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,385
Olivia.

363
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,325
Olivia.

364
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:17,125
Why haven't they sent me the interview result?

365
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:22,065
Sol, did I not get the job again?

366
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:25,205
That can't be, right?

367
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:29,705
Seo Jin.

368
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:31,670
You startled me. What is it?

369
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,870
I think I have to tell the truth to Dong Gu.

370
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,085
What do you mean?

371
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:39,740
Dong Gu is crying right now.

372
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,885
Why is he crying?

373
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:44,850
What does his crying have to do with us?

374
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,880
Seo Jin.

375
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,120
Do you have conscience at all?

376
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,150
What do you mean?

377
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,160
What does conscience have to do with this?

378
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,260
Don't you feel guilty?

379
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,665
Don't you feel sorry to Dong Gu?

380
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:57,760
Why should I be sorry to Dong Gu?

381
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,905
How could you do this?

382
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,245
I can't even look at Dong Gu.

383
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:04,740
Jun Ki, what happened was...

384
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,940
a mistake that we made after drinking.

385
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,815
It's nothing to be guilty about.

386
00:20:08,985 --> 00:20:11,650
You're unbelievable.

387
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:14,115
Don't you feel embarrassed in front of Sol?

388
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:17,755
I had no idea that you were so shameless.

389
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:19,155
Shameless?

390
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:24,020
Jun Ki, I think you're too upset right now.

391
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,620
Get some sleep.

392
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,170
You'll feel better after some sleep.

393
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:29,605
Okay?

394
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,635
Get some sleep.

395
00:20:32,705 --> 00:20:34,005
It'll be okay, right?

396
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,110
Why are you laughing?

397
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,085
I'm laughing because I can't believe it.

398
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:47,210
The US president becomes a zombie...

399
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,225
and does martial arts? It makes no sense.

400
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:52,050
The US president is reborn as Bruce Lee.

401
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,920
It appears in Season One in detail.

402
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
Does it make sense?

403
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,065
Even I can write that.

404
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:00,465
Hey.

405
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:02,405
Until when will you stay here?

406
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,975
Until I catch that jerk.

407
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:07,975
I'm getting off work soon,

408
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:09,530
so get changed soon.

409
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,145
(Fat Barbecue Restaurant Owner)

410
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:17,145
- Yes, sir. - It's me.

411
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:20,040
Pour water in five cup noodles and bring them to the restaurant.

412
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,155
Pardon?

413
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:23,610
I'm just about to get off work.

414
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,580
Then you can drop them off on your way out.

415
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,995
- Hurry up. - Hello?

416
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:29,465
Hello? Sir. Sir. Sir?

417
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:33,935
Why? What is it this time?

418
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,505
He thinks I'm at his beck and call.

419
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,200
Sir. I've brought the five noodles you asked for.

420
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,745
Hey. What took you so long?

421
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:45,075
You should be quicker.

422
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,675
How much is it?

423
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:48,315
That'll be 4 dollars and 50 cents.

424
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:49,915
Here.

425
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:03,795
- Goodbye, sir. - Okay.

426
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:05,265
Soo Ah. Let's go.

427
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:09,135
Du Shik.

428
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:12,205
While we're here, why don't we eat some meat?

429
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,535
It's on me.

430
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,445
Why eat meat all of a sudden? Let's just go.

431
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:18,215
Hey. Wait. Hey.

432
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,615
Come here.

433
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:29,680
Why? Do you guys want some meat?

434
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,325
Bring two servings of pork and one bottle of soda now.

435
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:34,380
I want the meat cooked.

436
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,420
I don't feel like grilling it myself.

437
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,865
- What did you say? - Why? You don't want to?

438
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:40,520
If your customer asks for something, just do it.

439
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,830
You little brat, how dare you talk down to me?

440
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,935
Why? Does it upset you?

441
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:47,040
Aren't customers allowed to talk down to the employees?

442
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:48,245
What?

443
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:55,670
Hey. Why did you throw it away here?

444
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,280
The price of the meat includes cleaning service fees, right?

445
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,840
That's exactly what you said earlier.

446
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,290
You little brat. You must've lost your mind.

447
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:03,525
What did you say?

448
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:05,095
Brat?

449
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:09,565
Did you just call your dear customer a brat?

450
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:14,135
My goodness. The owner here treats his customers like trash.

451
00:23:14,235 --> 00:23:16,200
What are you doing? What? What's wrong?

452
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:18,060
What did you just do?

453
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,875
Did you just hit me?

454
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:22,470
A frail girl like me?

455
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,640
I didn't hit you. I just grabbed your shoulder real gently.

456
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,775
What's wrong?

457
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:31,515
- Gosh. - Look at this.

458
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:32,985
Look at how my arm's dangling.

459
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:35,180
My shoulder must be broken.

460
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,780
- All of a sudden? - Du Shik. Report him to the police.

461
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,680
- The police? - I'm in so much pain.

462
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,995
Why are you doing this? Please stop.

463
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:43,665
Oh, dear.

464
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:46,100
Hey, hey. Oh, dear.

465
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:48,505
Mommy.

466
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,005
What's keeping you? Hurry up.

467
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,150
It hurts again. I don't think I can handle it.

468
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:03,670
Du Shik. Hurry up and call the police.

469
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,955
I'm sorry.

470
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:08,185
"I'm sorry?"

471
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,355
That's it?

472
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:12,325
Please forgive me.

473
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:15,765
You should say it to him too.

474
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:19,465
What are you doing? Hurry up and say it.

475
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:21,705
Please forgive me.

476
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:25,330
Please forgive me for my actions.

477
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,505
That's all right.

478
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:29,475
- Hey, mister. - Yes?

479
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:31,745
He may seem like a fool,

480
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,500
but his mother ate seaweed soup after giving birth to him...

481
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,215
and celebrated. Do you know that?

482
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:39,480
So you have no right to talk down to him.

483
00:24:39,485 --> 00:24:42,855
He's not your slave that you can look down on and boss around.

484
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:48,025
If I catch you treating him that way again,

485
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,265
I don't know what I might do to you.

486
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:53,495
- Do you understand me? - Yes.

487
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:57,065
By the way, how's your shoulder?

488
00:25:02,645 --> 00:25:04,445
- I feel fine now. - Pardon?

489
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:07,245
You can give my medical expenses to your staff as a bonus.

490
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:08,885
Du Shik. Let's go.

491
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:11,820
All right.

492
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:13,185
Goodbye.

493
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:15,325
- Goodbye. - What are you doing? Let's go.

494
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:19,695
Goodbye.

495
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:21,795
Soo Ah. Gosh.

496
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:23,665
You were amazing.

497
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:25,865
I feel like I got something off my chest thanks to you.

498
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:28,430
So if you see someone take advantage...

499
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,875
or give weaker people a hard time, don't let them get away with it.

500
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:34,435
If you do, they'll think it's okay to treat others like that.

501
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:36,700
You'll only become a pushover.

502
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,975
All right. I won't.

503
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:42,015
Why is my bag so heavy?

504
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:44,915
Hey. Carry my bag.

505
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:47,215
- What? - What are you doing?

506
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:48,585
Carry my bag for me.

507
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:50,120
It's heavy. Hurry and take it.

508
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,025
Oh, dear. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts so bad.

509
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,765
Putting on a complete act has gotten me hungry.

510
00:25:57,365 --> 00:25:59,235
Hey. Go buy me some tteokbokki.

511
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:01,390
- What? - What are you doing?

512
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,635
I told you I'm hungry.

513
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm hungry. I'm so hungry.

514
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,875
Okay, okay. All right.

515
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:09,575
I'll get you tteokbokki.

516
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:11,945
Wait a minute.

517
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,745
Soo Ah. Aren't you taking advantage of me right now?

518
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:19,415
How could there be such a thing between friends?

519
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:20,815
I'm asking you a favor. It's a favor.

520
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:25,855
What are you waiting for? Go and buy some.

521
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:27,495
Move.

522
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:30,595
- Move it. - All right.

523
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:47,245
It tastes...

524
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:49,440
great.

525
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,685
- Really? - Yes. It's really delicious.

526
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,925
You see? I said you could do it with a little practice.

527
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:57,485
Thank you.

528
00:26:57,755 --> 00:26:59,495
I owe it all to you, Hyung Joon.

529
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:03,095
Yoon Ah. Why do you want to become a pastry chef?

530
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:04,895
Well...

531
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:07,335
This is a little embarrassing,

532
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:09,260
but I'm a bit sloppy,

533
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,335
and I always make careless mistakes.

534
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:13,275
But for the first time, I was praised.

535
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:15,545
People said the bread I baked was good.

536
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:20,245
I thought this might be the only thing I could be good at.

537
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,715
I'm going to work hard and make sure I succeed.

538
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:27,455
I'm going to open a large bakery like yours.

539
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:30,225
I want to let Sol...

540
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:32,195
do whatever she wants.

541
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:34,625
I see.

542
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:37,690
Yoon Ah. From now on, when you get the time,

543
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,065
come here to practice.

544
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:40,765
I'll tell my staff that you'll be coming.

545
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:42,065
Really?

546
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:44,265
Thank you.

547
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:45,735
I really appreciate it.

548
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:58,915
What's that sound?

549
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:07,825
What on earth is this?

550
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:12,395
It's me. It's Olivia.

551
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:14,695
Olivia?

552
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:16,765
Olivia is...

553
00:28:17,935 --> 00:28:19,175
You're Dong Gu's camera?

554
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:23,675
You don't know how much my owner cared for me.

555
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:26,675
You ruined everything.

556
00:28:26,815 --> 00:28:28,585
This is all your fault.

557
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:30,245
It's all your fault.

558
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:32,115
I'm sorry.

559
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:35,185
- I didn't do it on purpose. - I don't want to hear it.

560
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:38,755
How long did you think you'd be able to hide the truth?

561
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:41,220
I was going to tell him,

562
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:43,125
- but Seo Jin... - Don't make excuses.

563
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:45,065
You didn't end up telling him either.

564
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:47,435
I can't forgive you.

565
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:50,265
I won't forgive you.

566
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,075
Blood, blood, blood.

567
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:04,985
This isn't right. I was wrong.

568
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:07,555
This isn't right.

569
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:10,880
Seo Jin. Seo Jin, wake up.

570
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,350
Seo Jin, wake up. Seo Jin.

571
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,955
Why? What is it now?

572
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:15,565
Olivia.

573
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,365
She was in my room.

574
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:18,965
Who's Olivia?

575
00:29:19,135 --> 00:29:21,790
She was shedding tears of blood. Dong Gu's...

576
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,665
What on earth are you talking about?

577
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:25,935
I can't go on living like this.

578
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:28,375
I think we'll have to tell Dong Gu the truth.

579
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:34,115
Jun Ki. Wait. Why are you doing this?

580
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:36,910
Why do you keep insisting on telling that to Dong Gu?

581
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,485
That way, I think I can move on.

582
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:41,015
Olivia. Olivia.

583
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:44,790
Jun Ki. Jun Ki.

584
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:46,395
Gosh. What's wrong with him?

585
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:51,965
I can't imagine how painful it must've been.

586
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:59,535
Dong Gu. There's something I need to confess to you.

587
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:00,805
What is it?

588
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:04,275
To tell you the truth, Seo Jin and I...

589
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:07,775
- Well, you see... - Wait a minute. Wait.

590
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,545
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

591
00:30:11,655 --> 00:30:12,980
Are you really going to act like this?

592
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:14,785
How much longer are you going to hide this from him?

593
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,980
Don't you feel bad for him? How much longer are you going to lie to him?

594
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,825
If you keep acting this way,

595
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,755
she'll eventually come to you.

596
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:23,920
Olivia.

597
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,535
- Olivia will... - What are you talking about?

598
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:28,935
What on earth you talking about?

599
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:30,335
What is it?

600
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,835
Seo Jin. You tell him.

601
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:36,005
This is your last chance to repent.

602
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:37,905
Gosh. You're driving me crazy.

603
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,470
Why on earth do we have to tell him? Why does he have to know?

604
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,345
Seo Jin. Are you really going to continue acting this way?

605
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:48,955
All right. I'll tell him. Are you satisfied?

606
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:51,150
This is driving me insane.

607
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:52,695
What are you two doing?

608
00:30:52,795 --> 00:30:55,590
I don't understand why I have to tell my brother this.

609
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:56,865
Go ahead and say it.

610
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:01,635
- Dong Gu. Actually... - Yes?

611
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:04,090
Yesterday, after having some drinks...

612
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,330
We drank a bit.

613
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,505
Go on.

614
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:08,945
Jun Ki and I...

615
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:12,515
What is it? Why is it taking you so long?

616
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:15,470
We kissed.

617
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,840
Yes. She and I kissed yesterday.

618
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,015
What?

619
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:20,115
What are you talking about?

620
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,120
Why would I do that with you?

621
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:23,950
Weren't you talking about the kiss?

622
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:25,395
What are you talking about?

623
00:31:26,325 --> 00:31:28,460
I was talking about how we broke Dong Gu's camera yesterday.

624
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:29,665
What?

625
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:35,565
Wait a moment.

626
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:38,305
So to sum it up,

627
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:41,635
you drank together yesterday...

628
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:43,870
and broke my camera.

629
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,115
No! No!

630
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:47,715
Before that,

631
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:51,715
you drank together...

632
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:54,085
and kissed.

633
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:56,380
Kiss? You two?

634
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,285
Is it true? Is it?

635
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:02,120
Dong Gu, it...

636
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,895
It was a mistake.

637
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:05,420
A mistake?

638
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,265
Dong Gu,

639
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:10,160
calm down.

640
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,660
Calm down?

641
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,475
How can I calm myself down right now?

642
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:15,345
Come here.

643
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:23,085
Come here!

644
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:24,870
What are you doing?

645
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,415
What are you doing inside the room?

646
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:28,085
Open the door!

647
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,490
Open it!

648
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:31,680
- Kang Seo Jin, open the door! - Dong Gu!

649
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,380
- Please calm down. - Open the door!

650
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,880
- Dong Gu, calm down. - Open it!

651
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,495
Think rationally.

652
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:38,795
Open it!

653
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:40,495
I...

654
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:43,465
What happened? Why did it get so quiet?

655
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,065
Is he gone?

656
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:47,875
- Oh, my. - Gosh, I thought I was dead.

657
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:51,175
Chewbacca,

658
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:53,575
did we really kiss?

659
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:56,185
Did we really do it?

660
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:58,470
Yes.

661
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,180
Why did you tell him that?

662
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,515
You told me to tell him.

663
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,710
You said that it was the last chance and that I should tell the truth.

664
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,450
I thought you were talking about the camera.

665
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,625
Gosh!

666
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:10,125
Wait a moment.

667
00:33:10,665 --> 00:33:12,860
- Seo Jin. - Yes?

668
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,890
Did you make me drink alcohol on purpose?

669
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,940
What? Are you out of your mind?

670
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:21,575
- Why would I do that? - You!

671
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:24,205
Come here! Come over here!

672
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:28,545
Come here!

673
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,115
Hey!

674
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:38,525
- Dong Gu. - Shut it!

675
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:41,625
How dare you?

676
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:43,295
Kiss?

677
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:48,065
My head hurts.

678
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,635
Dong Gu, it was a mistake.

679
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:54,305
I must have gone crazy because of the drinks.

680
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:56,070
Even if I don't have a boyfriend,

681
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,905
he's not my type.

682
00:33:58,275 --> 00:34:00,040
What?

683
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,410
I don't like you either with your outbursts and beard.

684
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,510
- What? Do you want to die? - Gosh.

685
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:05,655
Shut it!

686
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:09,255
You shouldn't be within 5m from each other now on.

687
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:11,150
Don't even look at each other,

688
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:14,395
talk to each other, or think about each other. Okay?

689
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:15,765
All right.

690
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:18,225
Okay.

691
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:20,495
What are you doing? Move!

692
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:23,305
Move away from each other now!

693
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:24,805
- Now! - Move!

694
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:28,135
Quickly! Move!

695
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:33,815
I'm stressed out as it is. They're making it worse.

696
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:43,455
Dong Gu, give that to me.

697
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:45,280
It's fine. I'll do it.

698
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,650
Just give it to me.

699
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,195
I'll do it.

700
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:50,925
Don't mind me. Just take care of your business.

701
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,890
- All right. - All right.

702
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,965
Dong Gu.

703
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:57,405
Are you angry at me?

704
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,330
You won't even talk to me nowadays.

705
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,975
What? I did talk to you.

706
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:04,275
It's nothing like that.

707
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:07,215
That's good.

708
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:10,985
I'll go downstairs and prepare dinner.

709
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:12,855
- Sure. You do that. - Okay.

710
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:33,605
What are you doing there?

711
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:34,975
Nothing.

712
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:37,570
What is that?

713
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,000
This?

714
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,145
It helps calm down my swollen eyes. It's a must-have for models.

715
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:46,715
My eyes swelled up after staying at the store the past few days.

716
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:48,755
Really?

717
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:56,525
Why are you sighing so much?

718
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:58,935
What's wrong?

719
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:01,365
Is it because of Yoon Ah?

720
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:03,105
I...

721
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:08,075
wanted to stop, but I can't stop liking her.

722
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:10,805
Soo Ah,

723
00:36:11,615 --> 00:36:14,275
I like her more and more.

724
00:36:15,655 --> 00:36:17,645
Why do you like her so much?

725
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,455
I don't know.

726
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:25,285
I don't know what I like about her, nor why I like her.

727
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:38,205
("A Simple Confession")

728
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:41,560
I don't know what to do.

729
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,645
I can't come up with answers.

730
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:46,215
I only have part time jobs on babies' first birthday parties.

731
00:36:46,515 --> 00:36:49,585
I can't even take care of her.

732
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:55,215
("Three Idiots", "If Only")

733
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:58,355
Can I really become a movie director?

734
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:03,995
It might just end as a dream.

735
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:05,695
Dong Gu.

736
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:09,565
Long time no see.

737
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:12,400
- I haven't seen you in a while. - Hello, Director.

738
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,560
What do you do these days?

739
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,170
Not much. How about you?

740
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,830
I'm filming a movie.

741
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,370
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

742
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,380
I'm recruiting staff members.

743
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:23,885
Do you want to work for my team?

744
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:25,045
Me?

745
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:30,485
- I'll think about it. - All right.

746
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:32,185
- Bye. - Bye.

747
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:42,135
Gosh, we are in deficit again.

748
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:44,790
We might even lose our house now.

749
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,075
I know. It's a problem.

750
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,505
I'm here.

751
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:51,570
- Hello. - Hello.

752
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,015
How did the filming go?

753
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:54,675
It was good.

754
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:59,115
Why are you sighing?

755
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:00,585
Did something go wrong?

756
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:02,780
I met...

757
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,950
a director I used to work with on my way home.

758
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,920
- And? - He asked me...

759
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,595
if I wanted to work for his team.

760
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:11,450
So? Are you going to do it?

761
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,235
I told him that I'd think about it.

762
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:15,130
What is there to think about?

763
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:17,830
You're not going to earn much. You won't get to sleep at night,

764
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,800
nor be able to come home. You'll suffer.

765
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,535
What about the store then?

766
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:24,670
We might not be able to pay for the rent soon.

767
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,900
You can't do it.

768
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,200
I didn't say I'd do it. I only said I'll think about it.

769
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,515
I wasn't serious.

770
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:38,185
Hello?

771
00:38:38,455 --> 00:38:40,795
Yes, it's Kang Seo Jin.

772
00:38:42,295 --> 00:38:43,425
What?

773
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:44,965
What?

774
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:48,465
All right. Thank you.

775
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:51,635
What? What was it about?

776
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:53,205
Did something happen again?

777
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:56,300
No, it was the newspaper company that I interviewed for.

778
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,945
I passed the final screening.

779
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,445
They told me to start working tomorrow.

780
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:02,815
- Really? - Yes.

781
00:39:03,185 --> 00:39:05,715
I'm not in a dream, right?

782
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:07,915
Why did you pinch me?

783
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:13,755
It's not a dream. Did I really get in?

784
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:18,020
- Oh, my. - Oh my goodness.

785
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,235
- Gosh. - Good job. I'm proud of you.

786
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:22,065
What's this about?

787
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,790
Seo Jin got the job.

788
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,900
She'll start working tomorrow.

789
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,035
Really?

790
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:30,445
Congratulations, Chewbacca! Congratulations!

791
00:39:31,945 --> 00:39:34,715
Don't come near her. I told you to keep the distance.

792
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:36,345
All right. Shut it.

793
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:39,180
Congratulations, Chewbacca. You'll buy us something, right?

794
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,315
Of course.

795
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:43,185
- Yes! - Congratulations.

796
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:50,690
You'll be a probationary employee for three weeks.

797
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,220
The entertainment department is shorthanded,

798
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,020
so you'll be working there.

799
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,565
Here is...

800
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:58,890
your seat right here. Good luck.

801
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,275
Thank you.

802
00:40:06,185 --> 00:40:08,315
No, I need to say hello first.

803
00:40:11,515 --> 00:40:14,710
Hello, I'm Kang Seo Jin. I'm new here!

804
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,325
I'll do my best!

805
00:40:25,235 --> 00:40:27,465
Everyone must be busy.

806
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:28,895
Who are you?

807
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:32,735
I'm Kang Seo Jin, the new trainee.

808
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:35,075
- You're the new trainee? - Yes.

809
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:36,370
Nice to meet you.

810
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,845
But what are you doing? Why aren't you working?

811
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:40,915
Sorry?

812
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:45,280
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.

813
00:40:45,285 --> 00:40:47,780
Give me any task, and I'll do my best.

814
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,310
Have you heard of "Mask Singer"?

815
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,480
There's one singer whose identity has been unknown for seven weeks.

816
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,120
Everyone is trying so hard to find out.

817
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,395
- I see. - You find it out.

818
00:40:57,695 --> 00:40:58,860
Sorry?

819
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:01,765
Find out who Blushing Webfoot Octopus is.

820
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:03,560
How could I...

821
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,305
You said you'd do your best whatever task is given to you.

822
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:08,340
So find it out.

823
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:11,570
Also, don't forget to take a picture of their face.

824
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,915
It's important.

825
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:15,215
- Understood? - Yes.

826
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,625
How will I find it out?

827
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:25,085
My goodness.

828
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:30,495
Is it here?

829
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:32,895
All right.

830
00:41:33,335 --> 00:41:36,360
Excuse me, is this where they film "Mask Singer"?

831
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,935
Yes. Who are you?

832
00:41:38,275 --> 00:41:39,500
I'm a reporter.

833
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,375
I'm here for a news story. Please let me in.

834
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:43,510
Hold on. Where are you going?

835
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:45,375
It's not open to the public.

836
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:47,975
I'm a reporter. A reporter.

837
00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:50,150
You can't enter.

838
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:52,710
I'm not even letting the president in. Please go back.

839
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,980
What?

840
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,350
Do you not respect the public's right to know?

841
00:41:56,355 --> 00:41:59,495
If you don't let me in, I don't know what I might do.

842
00:42:00,195 --> 00:42:01,425
Did you just laugh?

843
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:04,595
Let go of me. Let go.

844
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:07,390
Respect the public's right to know.

845
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,835
Just go back, okay?

846
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:11,665
Gosh, I can't believe him.

847
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:13,075
Hey!

848
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:15,635
What should I do?

849
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:18,145
How can you do this to me?

850
00:42:18,345 --> 00:42:20,370
What is this?

851
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,910
- You look great. - That voice sounds familiar.

852
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,415
It suits you perfectly.

853
00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:28,255
Gosh. I can't wear a costume like this.

854
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:29,825
What's going on?

855
00:42:30,855 --> 00:42:33,080
You said it was a drama.

856
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,695
It is.

857
00:42:34,895 --> 00:42:36,765
- A children's drama. - What?

858
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:38,590
Fine, let's say so.

859
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:40,320
But you said I'd play opposite the lead character.

860
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,995
You will.

861
00:42:42,005 --> 00:42:44,060
The lead character is Aqua Man.

862
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,360
As the evil octopus, you'll be defeated by him.

863
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,060
It means you'll play opposite the lead character.

864
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,205
You deceived me.

865
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:51,445
- Excuse me. - What?

866
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:55,175
I knew it. It was you.

867
00:42:55,285 --> 00:42:57,480
What's with that costume?

868
00:42:57,485 --> 00:42:59,315
- Are you a webfoot octopus? - I'm an octopus.

869
00:42:59,655 --> 00:43:02,585
A webfoot octopus has smaller suckers.

870
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:04,625
- What are you doing here? - Me?

871
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:07,825
I'm here for a news article.

872
00:43:08,665 --> 00:43:10,390
You already get to write an article?

873
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,025
That's impressive, Chewbacca.

874
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:14,465
Stop calling me that.

875
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:18,665
By the way, do you know who Blushing Webfoot Octopus...

876
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,800
on "Mask Singer" is?

877
00:43:20,805 --> 00:43:22,775
- Blushing Webfoot Octopus? - Yes.

878
00:43:22,845 --> 00:43:24,575
How would I know?

879
00:43:24,845 --> 00:43:25,970
Why are you asking?

880
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,475
I was ordered to find out.

881
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:29,640
It won't be easy.

882
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,650
They maintain tight security.

883
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:34,915
- Not even producers can find out. - Really?

884
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:37,755
I even have to take a picture of the person. I'm in trouble.

885
00:43:38,025 --> 00:43:40,225
I don't care about Blushing Webfoot Octopus.

886
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:42,750
What are you going to do now?

887
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,460
What do you think?

888
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:46,035
You're all dressed now. Let's start shooting.

889
00:43:46,065 --> 00:43:47,390
Follow me.

890
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,965
- Where are you going? - Hurry.

891
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:51,635
Wait!

892
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,475
He is never of help.

893
00:43:55,705 --> 00:43:57,745
Why did I kiss him?

894
00:43:58,315 --> 00:44:00,045
I blame the alcohol.

895
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:04,215
By the way, how will I find out who Blushing Webfoot Octopus is?

896
00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:07,820
The shooting is done.

897
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:10,225
You're back. Have a seat.

898
00:44:13,665 --> 00:44:15,755
Do you have something to tell me?

899
00:44:15,935 --> 00:44:19,665
Someone requested us to edit a video of his child growing up.

900
00:44:19,705 --> 00:44:21,435
Do you want to work on it?

901
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:22,890
Me?

902
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,070
Can I do everything the way I want?

903
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:28,735
Yes. All the materials...

904
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:31,570
have been uploaded. Feel free to download and use them.

905
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,515
I trust you'll do a good job.

906
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:36,470
It'll be like a beautiful movie.

907
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,315
You'll be surprised.

908
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:47,425
I haven't worked on a storyboard in a long time.

909
00:44:47,595 --> 00:44:49,990
It reminds me of the old days when I used to make short films.

910
00:44:49,995 --> 00:44:51,365
This is exciting.

911
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:53,795
I think I need to shoot some more.

912
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:55,665
What should I do?

913
00:44:57,475 --> 00:44:59,265
You must be tired.

914
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:01,105
It's for you.

915
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,405
Thank you.

916
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:05,075
Let me go in now.

917
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:06,700
No.

918
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,845
Please sir.

919
00:45:13,455 --> 00:45:15,015
Here. Are you happy now?

920
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:16,425
Thank you.

921
00:45:16,495 --> 00:45:18,155
I'm going in.

922
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,120
No.

923
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,195
Please sir.

924
00:45:28,265 --> 00:45:30,135
Sir.

925
00:45:30,175 --> 00:45:31,935
Please.

926
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:35,935
Sir.

927
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:38,605
Let me go in just once.

928
00:45:38,815 --> 00:45:41,575
I really have to find out.

929
00:45:42,215 --> 00:45:44,140
I'm begging you.

930
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,515
If you show up here again, I'll call the police.

931
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,755
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

932
00:45:53,095 --> 00:45:54,425
What should I do?

933
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:58,590
Where am I? Where am I?

934
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,235
Here I am.

935
00:46:05,105 --> 00:46:07,375
It's not working.

936
00:46:08,745 --> 00:46:11,475
I can't shoot like this.

937
00:46:14,685 --> 00:46:16,285
I know what I should do.

938
00:46:18,385 --> 00:46:19,910
Are you happy?

939
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,115
You look so happy.

940
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:23,925
I'm sorry you had to come.

941
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:26,320
He was crying too much, so I couldn't shoot.

942
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,550
Don't worry. You're shooting something?

943
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,890
What are you shooting?

944
00:46:29,895 --> 00:46:34,895
I need some clips for the baby's growth footage.

945
00:46:35,435 --> 00:46:36,805
Speaking of which,

946
00:46:36,975 --> 00:46:41,075
can you help me out?

947
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:42,775
Me?

948
00:46:42,815 --> 00:46:44,445
What can I do?

949
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:46,945
Well...

950
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:49,670
Am I supposed to stay like this?

951
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,210
Yes. Stay still like that.

952
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:54,920
Do I have to wear this costume?

953
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:58,485
Yes, it'll make it easier to remove you from the video.

954
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:00,120
Please hang in there.

955
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,122
It won't take long. Ready.

956
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:04,358
Action.

957
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,528
- Good. - Good boy.

958
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:09,630
- You're doing great. - We're almost done.

959
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:11,298
Cut!

960
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:13,534
Good job!

961
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:14,768
Yoon Ah, you did a great job.

962
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:16,637
Are we done?

963
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:18,172
It's a bit out of focus.

964
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,474
Ready, action.

965
00:47:20,474 --> 00:47:22,676
All right. Yoon Ah.

966
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:23,844
Higher.

967
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,045
- Like this? - Yes.

968
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:27,414
Look at me. Nice facial expression.

969
00:47:27,414 --> 00:47:30,250
You're doing great. Look at me. Cut!

970
00:47:30,751 --> 00:47:32,052
Cut!

971
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:35,355
Good job.

972
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,625
Yoon Ah, you did an amazing job.

973
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,165
Let's try one more time.

974
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:46,700
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

975
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,969
How long do I have to play these roles?

976
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:53,273
An octopus ink gun?

977
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:55,542
What a pretentious name.

978
00:47:55,676 --> 00:47:59,246
I couldn't pee well because of these tentacles.

979
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:09,156
- Go, Korea! - Go, Korea!

980
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:17,531
- We meet again. - I know.

981
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:20,033
What a coincidence.

982
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:21,702
Your costume...

983
00:48:21,702 --> 00:48:24,738
I've been cast for the children's drama, "Super Aqua Man".

984
00:48:24,972 --> 00:48:26,240
I'm Blue Crab Man.

985
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:28,475
- Really? - Yes.

986
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:29,643
I'll be on that show too.

987
00:48:30,043 --> 00:48:31,311
I'm Octopus Man.

988
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:33,847
Now that we met,

989
00:48:33,847 --> 00:48:36,216
why don't we have some octopus and soju together tonight?

990
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:37,918
- Sounds good. - Good.

991
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:40,554
Let's go.

992
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,858
After you.

993
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:51,031
What is this on my first day?

994
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:53,867
I thought everything would work out once I got a job.

995
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:58,405
Hey, trainee.

996
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:00,607
What are you doing here?

997
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:02,209
Ma'am.

998
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,611
Have you found out who Blushing Webfoot Octopus is?

999
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:06,313
Not yet.

1000
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:08,916
Their security is too tight.

1001
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:12,586
Are you asking me to cut you some slack?

1002
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,488
No.

1003
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:16,790
- That's Seo Jin. - Hey.

1004
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,459
Are you sure you can work as a reporter?

1005
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:21,128
Even if their security is tight,

1006
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,830
you're supposed to find it out by all means.

1007
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:26,333
How did you even get into the company?

1008
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,735
- I'm sorry. - Cut it out.

1009
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:31,705
You're not allowed to come back to the office until you find out.

1010
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:33,907
If you fail to find out,

1011
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:36,476
just quit. Do you understand?

1012
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:38,545
Yes.

1013
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,522
I can't believe that woman.

1014
00:49:48,522 --> 00:49:51,191
Do you know that girl?

1015
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:53,727
- Blue Crab Man. - Yes?

1016
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:55,329
Please do me a favor.

1017
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:02,603
Blue Crab Man, are you ready?

1018
00:50:03,737 --> 00:50:05,005
Okay.

1019
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:13,680
Hey!

1020
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:16,850
- What do you know about crabs? - What is it now?

1021
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,885
Hey, who are you?

1022
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:20,587
I'm...

1023
00:50:20,587 --> 00:50:22,489
- Okay. - Protecting peace, I'm righteous...

1024
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:24,458
Blue Crab Man.

1025
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:25,592
How dare he...

1026
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:27,327
Try to catch me.

1027
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:29,196
- Hey, you. - Gosh.

1028
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:30,998
Octopus Man, it's time.

1029
00:50:30,998 --> 00:50:32,799
Let me go.

1030
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:38,272
Take my octopus ink.

1031
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:53,620
Go ahead, Octopus Man.

1032
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,455
- Take care of the rest. - Hurry.

1033
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:03,130
(King of Kings)

1034
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,298
Let's see.

1035
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:06,400
"Scallop"?

1036
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,502
What, "spoon worm"?

1037
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:10,637
"Sea squirt" and "spoon worm"?

1038
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:11,805
(Is It Sea Squirt)

1039
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:13,707
Is it some seafood special?

1040
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:15,542
Where's Webfoot Octopus?

1041
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:17,244
Webfoot Octopus.

1042
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,413
"Blushing Webfoot Octopus"? I found it.

1043
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,048
There he is.

1044
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,788
You startled me.

1045
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:30,524
Who are you?

1046
00:51:30,524 --> 00:51:31,658
Hello.

1047
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:34,361
Are you Blushing Webfoot Octopus?

1048
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:36,196
You've been winning for seven weeks.

1049
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:38,432
Yes, but who are you?

1050
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:39,633
It's nice to meet you.

1051
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:42,002
I'm the villain who fights against Aqua Man.

1052
00:51:42,002 --> 00:51:43,970
I'm Octopus Man, Lee Jun Ki.

1053
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,773
What is your name?

1054
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:48,709
Pardon? Why do you ask?

1055
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:51,878
I'm Octopus, you're Webfoot Octopus.

1056
00:51:51,878 --> 00:51:54,581
We should be acquainted since we're both octopus.

1057
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:56,850
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

1058
00:51:58,618 --> 00:52:00,821
Come on, we're the same type.

1059
00:52:00,987 --> 00:52:02,589
I told you my name.

1060
00:52:02,589 --> 00:52:04,358
Isn't it polite to tell me yours?

1061
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,059
I can't tell you.

1062
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,160
Hey.

1063
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,362
How could you?

1064
00:52:08,362 --> 00:52:10,630
I wasn't going to do this, but I can't help it.

1065
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:12,299
Come here.

1066
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:13,667
No.

1067
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,002
What are you doing?

1068
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:18,438
Gosh.

1069
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:23,610
My leg.

1070
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:25,445
You're a murderer.

1071
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:28,515
Who are you? Security?

1072
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:30,417
Why aren't they coming? Goodness.

1073
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:31,551
What are you?

1074
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:33,920
Nice, Blue Crab Man.

1075
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:41,294
Gosh, come here.

1076
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:47,100
Hold him down.

1077
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,672
Octopus Man, it's time.

1078
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:53,907
Take it off.

1079
00:53:13,727 --> 00:53:14,861
What are you doing?

1080
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:21,501
You're embarrassing yourself by crying in front of people.

1081
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:23,770
Just leave. I'm not in the mood for jokes.

1082
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:26,206
I wanted to tell you who the Mask Singer is.

1083
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,608
I'll leave then.

1084
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:31,511
Wait, really?

1085
00:53:31,511 --> 00:53:33,113
How did you find out?

1086
00:53:35,248 --> 00:53:37,751
It's thanks to Blue Crab Man's sacrifice.

1087
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:39,986
- What? - You told me to leave.

1088
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,789
- See you. - Jun Ki.

1089
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:44,791
You can't just leave.

1090
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:46,159
You're so mean.

1091
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,432
What's this?

1092
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:55,469
Blushing Webfoot Octopus is Kang Kyun Sung.

1093
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:56,603
What's this?

1094
00:53:56,703 --> 00:53:58,171
I attach a photo of him.

1095
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:01,074
- Come here. - Hey.

1096
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:08,648
Were you Blushing Webfoot Octopus?

1097
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:10,450
I'm your fan.

1098
00:54:15,388 --> 00:54:16,556
Jun Ki.

1099
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:19,693
Hey.

1100
00:54:20,193 --> 00:54:21,661
Don't be so sad.

1101
00:54:21,962 --> 00:54:24,731
Don't let your senior get you down.

1102
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:27,267
You're good at being bold.

1103
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:29,169
Seo Jin.

1104
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,605
You can do it.

1105
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:33,507
You can do it!

1106
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,175
I'm busy.

1107
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:36,610
I'm leaving.

1108
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:06,973
- I'm home. - Hello.

1109
00:55:06,973 --> 00:55:08,275
Hello, Sol.

1110
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,110
Why are you coming home together?

1111
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,512
Yoon Ah helped me with my shoot today.

1112
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:15,749
Du Shik, I'll take Sol. I'll take care of her.

1113
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:17,117
Okay, let's go to your mom.

1114
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:20,687
Sol, did you have fun?

1115
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:21,988
Have you been well?

1116
00:55:22,122 --> 00:55:24,991
Yoon Ah, thank you for your hard work today.

1117
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:26,026
Don't mention it.

1118
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:27,994
Aren't you hungry? I'll prepare dinner.

1119
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:29,396
I'm okay.

1120
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:31,965
I have to edit, so I won't have time to eat.

1121
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:51,217
- Dong Gu. - Did you sleep well?

1122
00:55:52,118 --> 00:55:53,320
What's going on?

1123
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:55,522
Did you work all night?

1124
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:58,091
I couldn't sleep because I wanted to finish it.

1125
00:55:58,091 --> 00:55:59,993
I worked all night and finished editing.

1126
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:04,097
- Really? - Yes.

1127
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:06,600
Okay, it's done.

1128
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:10,136
I'm going to the studio.

1129
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,283
Hello.

1130
00:56:24,818 --> 00:56:26,152
What are you doing?

1131
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:28,121
I told you to quit...

1132
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:30,991
if you don't find out who the Mask Singer is.

1133
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,162
- Here you go. - Let's see what you took.

1134
00:56:36,363 --> 00:56:38,865
You didn't take a photo of a real webfoot octopus, right?

1135
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:40,233
Let's see.

1136
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,669
What?

1137
00:56:43,169 --> 00:56:45,905
Did you really take it? How?

1138
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,441
Octopus told me.

1139
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:51,378
- What Octopus? - Usually...

1140
00:56:52,612 --> 00:56:55,749
he's quite silly.

1141
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:58,284
Sometimes he's amazing.

1142
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,521
My goodness.

1143
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,192
Soo Ah.

1144
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:09,129
Until when will you wait at the convenience store?

1145
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:12,298
Until I catch that jerk.

1146
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:15,769
What? My nose bled today because of you.

1147
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,705
Is this how you treat me when I got rid of that bossy man?

1148
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:20,306
You're not loyal at all.

1149
00:57:20,306 --> 00:57:23,009
You're worse than him. You're the queen of bosses.

1150
00:57:23,009 --> 00:57:24,644
- What did you say? - I take it back.

1151
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,313
I'm home.

1152
00:57:28,548 --> 00:57:31,317
Hello, Dong Gu. What happened?

1153
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:32,786
It was a complete failure.

1154
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:36,156
He said that it was terrible and called me insane.

1155
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:38,224
What do you mean? Did something happen?

1156
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,361
I made a video of the baby growing up,

1157
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:43,263
but my boss hated it.

1158
00:57:43,263 --> 00:57:44,597
How did you make it?

1159
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:47,400
Will you be the judge?

1160
00:57:54,374 --> 00:57:55,542
(Birth of Hyun Ah)

1161
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:02,115
Dong Gu, what are those?

1162
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:04,584
They're sperm.

1163
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:05,852
What?

1164
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:08,288
Why would there be sperm in the video?

1165
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:10,056
The introduction...

1166
00:58:10,724 --> 00:58:13,026
shows the birth of life.

1167
00:58:13,026 --> 00:58:16,029
Sperms swim and meet an egg.

1168
00:58:16,029 --> 00:58:18,431
Then a baby is born.

1169
00:58:18,431 --> 00:58:20,533
Isn't it realistic and original?

1170
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:23,303
It's original indeed,

1171
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:25,605
but I wonder if this is necessary.

1172
00:58:25,605 --> 00:58:26,673
Really?

1173
00:58:26,973 --> 00:58:29,342
The next scene is amazing. Take a look.

1174
00:58:33,713 --> 00:58:35,482
(Hyun Ah is born.)

1175
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,152
Gosh.

1176
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:41,187
What's that?

1177
00:58:41,321 --> 00:58:44,324
Why did a baby pop out of that?

1178
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:45,625
Don't you know "The Matrix"?

1179
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:48,128
The baby grew in her mom's belly for 10 months.

1180
00:58:48,128 --> 00:58:49,596
Then she cries.

1181
00:58:49,596 --> 00:58:52,432
It's a dynamic scene of a baby being born.

1182
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,568
Isn't it too bizarre?

1183
00:58:55,568 --> 00:58:58,505
Don't you get immersed in it as the baby appears like this?

1184
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:00,607
Isn't it just like a movie?

1185
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:02,809
Next scene is like...

1186
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:04,711
the jump scene from "Whispering Corridors".

1187
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:07,147
The baby jumps from here and there.

1188
00:59:07,147 --> 00:59:09,582
I think that's enough.

1189
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:12,585
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

1190
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,621
Thanks for "The Matrix".

1191
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:16,222
What's wrong?

1192
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:20,660
Dong Gu, do you have to become a movie director?

1193
00:59:21,394 --> 00:59:22,495
What do you mean?

1194
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,697
I'm worried about your movies...

1195
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:26,399
being shown to the world.

1196
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:30,970
Hey, it isn't over yet.

1197
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,505
Watch the rest.

1198
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:01,534
I liked your video. It's like a movie.

1199
01:00:02,035 --> 01:00:03,336
I mean it.

1200
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:04,838
It's fine.

1201
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:08,208
Cheer up, Dong Gu.

1202
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:12,145
I want to, but I can't.

1203
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:16,349
I'm just worried that I'll just end up filming...

1204
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:18,017
birthday footage for the rest of my life.

1205
01:00:19,052 --> 01:00:22,388
I'm worried that I'll never make it to the movies.

1206
01:00:22,555 --> 01:00:24,424
Then you can start now.

1207
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:26,793
Start in the movie industry.

1208
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:28,995
You said you got an offer.

1209
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:33,566
- That's... - I've never seen you that happy.

1210
01:00:34,534 --> 01:00:36,069
I thought you were someone...

1211
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:38,905
who frowned, got irritated and angry every day.

1212
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:42,809
But when I saw you filming yesterday,

1213
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:46,613
I realized that you could smile so brightly like that.

1214
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,450
I realized that you must really...

1215
01:00:51,551 --> 01:00:52,819
love your job.

1216
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,022
Did I do that?

1217
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:57,924
So, Dong Gu,

1218
01:00:58,124 --> 01:01:01,127
don't be afraid. Start over.

1219
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:03,529
That's not as easy as it sounds.

1220
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:04,764
Gosh.

1221
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:07,600
I didn't take you for a coward.

1222
01:01:08,368 --> 01:01:11,471
- What? - If you can't do what you like...

1223
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:14,474
because you're worried of this and that,

1224
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,044
would your life be happy?

1225
01:01:19,946 --> 01:01:21,781
Won't you regret it later?

1226
01:01:25,084 --> 01:01:27,320
What's wrong with failing and stumbling?

1227
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,821
You can start over,

1228
01:01:29,255 --> 01:01:30,523
right?

1229
01:01:33,326 --> 01:01:34,527
Oh, my.

1230
01:01:35,762 --> 01:01:38,665
I must have sounded too nosy.

1231
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:43,603
I'm sorry.

1232
01:01:45,271 --> 01:01:48,508
Dong Gu, I'm done with housekeeping.

1233
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:51,177
I'll go and practice baking.

1234
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:54,013
Sure.

1235
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:02,055
Cheer up, Dong Gu!

1236
01:02:02,488 --> 01:02:04,557
Cheer up! Yes!

1237
01:02:22,709 --> 01:02:24,010
Sir.

1238
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,112
Hello, Dong Gu.

1239
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:27,947
Why are you here?

1240
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:31,818
I want to work for the directing team...

1241
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:33,419
that you talked about.

1242
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:35,054
I'll do my best.

1243
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:44,897
Hey, Dong Gu.

1244
01:02:45,865 --> 01:02:48,801
Soo Ah, where have you been?

1245
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:51,971
I came out for fresh air after staying at the convenience store.

1246
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:54,007
Why are you so happy?

1247
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:55,274
Did something good happen?

1248
01:02:56,476 --> 01:02:58,311
I'm going to start working for the movie industry.

1249
01:02:58,444 --> 01:03:00,113
I'm going to try no matter what.

1250
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:02,048
Really? Congratulations.

1251
01:03:05,184 --> 01:03:07,420
And I found out why I like Yoon Ah.

1252
01:03:07,954 --> 01:03:09,722
Really? What is it?

1253
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,992
I just like her without reason.

1254
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:15,995
I just like her.

1255
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,364
What does that even mean?

1256
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,968
How about her situation and Sol?

1257
01:03:22,402 --> 01:03:24,203
I'm not sure about that,

1258
01:03:24,404 --> 01:03:25,872
but there's one thing I'm sure about.

1259
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,042
If I lose Yoon Ah while considering all conditions,

1260
01:03:29,842 --> 01:03:31,677
I will never be happy.

1261
01:03:32,211 --> 01:03:33,746
I will regret for the rest of my life.

1262
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,815
That's why I want to ask her out.

1263
01:03:36,049 --> 01:03:38,351
Really? When?

1264
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:40,453
Now.

1265
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:56,602
Take care.

1266
01:03:56,602 --> 01:03:59,972
I'm sorry. You don't need to get me home every day like this.

1267
01:03:59,972 --> 01:04:02,141
It's fine. It's on my way home.

1268
01:04:02,141 --> 01:04:03,643
It's cold. You should go.

1269
01:04:03,843 --> 01:04:05,978
See you on the next class.

1270
01:04:21,094 --> 01:04:22,361
My phone...

1271
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:25,631
I must have left it in his car.

1272
01:04:28,968 --> 01:04:30,837
Dong Gu.

1273
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,548
Yoon Ah, I want to tell you something.

1274
01:04:42,615 --> 01:04:44,383
What? What is it?

1275
01:04:55,228 --> 01:04:56,496
I like you.

1276
01:04:57,697 --> 01:04:59,398
I really like you, Yoon Ah.

1277
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,855
(Thank you to special guest, Kang Kyun Sung.)

1278
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:46,512
(Welcome to Waikiki)
