1
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:14,195
Seo Jin, please wake up.

2
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:16,780
You haven't eaten anything for days.

3
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:17,850
Seriously.

4
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:19,180
It wasn't the first time you failed a job interview.

5
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,790
How long are you going to act like this?

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,120
Don't bother me anymore. Please get out of my room.

7
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:24,220
Stop being a brat.

8
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,660
Why did you slap the interviewer's face with pork ribs then?

9
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:28,360
She said he sexually harassed her.

10
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,075
But how could you actually slap his face though?

11
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:32,530
And she did it with a chunk of meat!

12
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:34,700
It's her temper.

13
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:35,830
Stop it!

14
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:38,215
Oh, my goodness. Why are you shouting at me?

15
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:41,010
Seo Jin, you should really shave.

16
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:43,655
What are you going to do if our guests see you now?

17
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,655
Are you crying?

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,795
Do you have any idea how much I wanted to work at that company?

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,935
That's where I've been wanting to go since I decided to be a journalist.

20
00:00:57,427 --> 00:01:00,175
How can you be so harsh on me when I need someone to cheer me up?

21
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:02,675
I... I mean...

22
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,205
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,130
Please stop crying. You'll get that job next time.

24
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:08,230
Forget about it.

25
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:10,145
Who's going to hire me...

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,985
when I'm cranky and have such a temper?

27
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:15,155
Forget about the journalist and even getting a job.

28
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,340
I'm giving up everything.

29
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:18,785
Giving up?

30
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,695
Kang Seo Jin!

31
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:23,320
Do you think it makes sense to give up your dream like this?

32
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,350
That's so petty. The Kangs don't...

33
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:27,590
I'm that stupid!

34
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,465
That's why I'm giving up!

35
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:36,760
I just said one thing.

36
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,130
Man, what on earth were you thinking?

37
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:40,370
Read the air!

38
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,100
- Is it difficult to do that? - Why did you say that?

39
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:43,100
- What? - Why did you do that?

40
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,400
- I didn't... - Seo Jin,

41
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:46,315
please eat. You can sleep again after that.

42
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:49,210
- I don't want it. - Seo Jin...

43
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,280
("Mock Test for Becoming a Journalist")

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,355
("There's Nothing Wrong with You!")

45
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:57,180
How's Seo Jin? Did she eat anything?

46
00:01:57,187 --> 00:02:00,935
No. She's just crying in her room.

47
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:02,520
That's really bad.

48
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:05,005
What can I do to make Seo Jin to feel better?

49
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:09,460
Seo Jin loves chicken feet. Should we go have it for dinner?

50
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:12,260
Do you really think she'll feel better with that?

51
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:14,770
What she needs now isn't chicken feet.

52
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:16,670
She needs our sincere emotional support.

53
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:17,740
Emotional support?

54
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,785
Like, "Pain is a blessing for the youth"?

55
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:22,855
It's too cringe to say such things.

56
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,055
Don't you agree, Yoon Ah?

57
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,420
How much does it cost to run a place like this?

58
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:38,060
It costs a lot.

59
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,635
Why? Do you want to have a bakery?

60
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:42,690
Do you want to be a pastry chef? What a huge dream!

61
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:43,860
What did I say?

62
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,530
I was just talking to myself. Am I not allowed to do that?

63
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:49,475
You are really bad at reading the air.

64
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:50,940
Why did I do?

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,845
I just said one thing.

66
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,040
- Why are you so upset at me? - When did I get upset?

67
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,140
I've never been upset in my life.

68
00:02:58,148 --> 00:02:59,810
You are upset now.

69
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:01,450
When? When did I get upset?

70
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,420
What you are doing now is showing how upset you are.

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,195
Do you not understand what I'm talking about?

72
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:09,190
What are you guys doing here?

73
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:10,860
Are you guys having a lover's argument?

74
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,190
What kind of nonsense is that?

75
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:13,560
What is that car by the way?

76
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:15,805
I'll be in a drama soon.

77
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:17,705
So I bought one.

78
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:20,400
It's not even a big role. Why did you buy a car?

79
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:22,030
Stop talking and just get in the car. It's cold outside.

80
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:23,475
I'll give you a ride to home.

81
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:25,085
Fine.

82
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:28,585
Rebecca

83
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:32,440
Welcome.

84
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,250
How old is this car? Does this thing work?

85
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:36,250
Of course.

86
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:39,025
Rebecca is a great car despite how she looks.

87
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:42,065
Here we go!

88
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:47,805
Rebecca?

89
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:50,660
What happened? Did the engine stop working?

90
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,330
It's okay.

91
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,815
I can start the engine again.

92
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:03,140
- What is going on? - It's okay.

93
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:06,085
- I can always stitch that up again. - But...

94
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,580
It's totally fine.

95
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:14,050
What on earth is fine? I'm getting off now.

96
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:16,550
What is this? The door's not working.

97
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,665
You can't open it from the inside. It only works from the outside.

98
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:19,935
What?

99
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:22,060
It's okay!

100
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:24,560
I can go out and open it for you.

101
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:25,745
It's not okay!

102
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:27,415
Hey! Rebecca isn't...

103
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:30,275
The door is broken and... What? Why is it open now?

104
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:31,900
Leave Rebecca alone.

105
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:33,070
I can look at the inside of this car from here.

106
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:35,210
Rebecca is a transparent friend.

107
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,010
Is this a puzzle or what?

108
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,155
The engine works now!

109
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:41,025
We are leaving shortly!

110
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:49,890
Rebecca

111
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:53,135
My Rebecca

112
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:58,405
- What's going on with Dong Gu? - I almost died.

113
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:01,230
I'll never get in Rebecca or whatever that was.

114
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:03,845
How can you call yourself a man when you're such a coward?

115
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:05,600
You are okay.

116
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:06,740
Stop that.

117
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:09,040
Du Shik, let me take Sol. Thanks for taking care of her.

118
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,070
Mommy's back!

119
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,880
Sol, I missed you! I really did!

120
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:14,395
I missed you too.

121
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:16,855
What are you doing?

122
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,150
("President Is Bruce Lee")

123
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:20,420
You are manipulating the number of hits again.

124
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:21,835
Everyone else does this.

125
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:25,060
Why isn't it going up these days? This is annoying.

126
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,935
Because it's not fun to read.

127
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:28,775
Why is it not fun?

128
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,960
Du Shik's good at writing.

129
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:33,030
Is he?

130
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:34,775
You haven't read his Internet novel, right?

131
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,115
Right.

132
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,470
The president gets kidnapped by aliens.

133
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:40,340
But somehow, the president shoots the palm blast to the aliens,

134
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:41,710
and kills them all.

135
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,385
Do you know who the president is?

136
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:45,885
He's the president of the United States.

137
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:48,950
It has an elaborate backstory that Bruce Lee reincarnated...

138
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,150
as the president of the US.

139
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:51,320
Look at that.

140
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:53,280
Does it make sense that Bruce Lee shoots a palm blast?

141
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,820
Right. Look down on me like that.

142
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:56,220
If I ever succeed,

143
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,260
you'll never be part of my work.

144
00:05:58,261 --> 00:05:59,505
Thank you!

145
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:00,905
Move!

146
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,890
- Du Shik. - Gosh, he's so sensitive.

147
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,805
- Are you offended again? - Stop it.

148
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,345
What's this book?

149
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:11,215
"Cheer Up, Youth,"

150
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:14,985
"Failure is not Falling but Staying Down".

151
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:18,280
They're just empty words.

152
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:19,555
It makes me cringe.

153
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,480
What a cringe-worthy title.

154
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:24,220
Do they think those words will cheer anyone up?

155
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,965
Exactly.

156
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:29,035
I'm so hungry. I'll make some ramyeon.

157
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:31,365
- I want some too. - I'll make two then.

158
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:33,005
Gosh.

159
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,245
- Hey. - Seo Jin.

160
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:40,515
Hey.

161
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,285
- Seo Jin. - Seo Jin.

162
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:48,385
How long is she going to stay that way?

163
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:52,055
I don't know. I'm worried that something will happen.

164
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:57,120
Yoon Ah, can't you take Seo Jin out?

165
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,965
Get some fresh air and comfort her.

166
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:01,735
Me?

167
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,860
You said what Seo Jin needs the most right now is...

168
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:07,335
our sincere emotional support.

169
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,175
Please do me this favor.

170
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,460
All right. I'll try.

171
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:13,705
Okay.

172
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,130
Wait and see.

173
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:18,715
I'll show you I can succeed. Lee Jun Ki!

174
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:22,810
Hey. Didn't I tell you to focus on your job?

175
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:24,355
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:28,280
If you have time for this, put this in my washing machine.

177
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:32,550
The passcode is 8914, okay?

178
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,765
Fine. Let go of me.

179
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:38,020
When is the new part-timer coming?

180
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:41,535
I just found someone. Stop complaining.

181
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,145
Here she comes.

182
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:56,055
Meet your new colleague. Her name is Kim Sun Woo.

183
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:58,425
- She's my daughter. - What?

184
00:07:58,614 --> 00:07:59,885
Why are you so surprised?

185
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,680
Hi.

186
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:04,325
Be nice to her...

187
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:06,550
and teach her a lot, okay?

188
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:08,165
Okay, Father.

189
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:09,765
- What? - What?

190
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,020
- What? I didn't say anything. - That's strange.

191
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,260
Dad.

192
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:16,875
We have to work. Go now.

193
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:22,070
My dad is giving you a hard time, right?

194
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,470
He's a bit picky.

195
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:24,500
Not at all.

196
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,940
Don't be so polite.

197
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,340
I'm a lot younger than you.

198
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:29,210
All right.

199
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:31,740
By the way, what do you do?

200
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:35,910
Well, I'm a writer. Or rather, I'm trying to be one.

201
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,780
That's so cool.

202
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:39,120
What kind of stuff do you write?

203
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:40,425
Scenarios.

204
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:46,035
My dream is to write a love story like "Love Letter"...

205
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:47,260
by Shunji Iwai.

206
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:49,130
I love that movie.

207
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:52,130
When you're done, please let me be the first person to read it.

208
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:53,430
Sure.

209
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:54,675
It's a promise.

210
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,215
Okay, honey.

211
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,810
- What? - What?

212
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,425
I didn't say anything. I didn't.

213
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:06,385
Baby shark

214
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,655
Is so cute

215
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:10,665
He lives in the sea

216
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:14,135
How many times have we watched this?

217
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,035
I'm sick of this song.

218
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,905
I hate sharks now.

219
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:22,835
It's time for UFC.

220
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:24,830
Should we try changing the channel?

221
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,075
Sure.

222
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,415
Under the sea

223
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,575
Daddy shark

224
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:31,585
Grandma shark

225
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:33,815
She's very caring

226
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:35,855
Under the sea

227
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:40,085
Fine. Watch it for the rest of your life.

228
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:42,095
Gosh.

229
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:44,095
My goodness.

230
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:46,465
Grandpa shark

231
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:48,065
We are

232
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,335
What's that sound?

233
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:51,405
What is it?

234
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:53,605
Where is it coming from?

235
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:09,055
Is this the sound of your heart beating?

236
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:11,625
Guys, I think...

237
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:13,685
I'm in love.

238
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,795
There he goes again.

239
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:20,165
Who is it this time?

240
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,990
Well, she's my boss's daughter.

241
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,690
She's so cute and sweet.

242
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:25,935
I don't care.

243
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:28,105
Didn't I tell you?

244
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:32,475
The cuter and prettier the girl is, the lower chance you have.

245
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:34,670
Wake up.

246
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,730
It's different this time.

247
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:38,115
She seems very interested in me.

248
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:42,415
Hello. Yes.

249
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:44,685
A film company?

250
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:51,395
All right.

251
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,865
I'm the director of Artist Top Film,

252
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:56,290
Tak Myung Hwan.

253
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:57,605
I see.

254
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,635
I enjoyed reading your Internet novel.

255
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:03,330
I see.

256
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:05,800
Was it that interesting?

257
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:08,675
No. It was a piece of rubbish.

258
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:12,015
- Then why... - But...

259
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,140
I'd like to talk about the bed scene on page 4 of the 7th episode...

260
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:18,685
of your novel, "President Is Bruce Lee".

261
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:22,110
If I may, I'd like to call you an erotic genius.

262
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:23,895
You're the incarnation of eroticism.

263
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,325
Let me get to the point.

264
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:28,550
I'd like you to write a scenario for me.

265
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,935
What? A scenario?

266
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:33,365
- Like what? - Have you heard of ...

267
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,760
the "Goodbye Sister-in-law" series?

268
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:38,030
I'm afraid I haven't. What is it about?

269
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:41,845
It's an erotic movie about a man who loves his sister-in-law.

270
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:44,445
"Goodbye Sister-in-law 5"...

271
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,240
What do you take me for?

272
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:47,955
I don't write stuff like that.

273
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:51,355
Paul Verhoeven, Ang Lee, and Stanley Kubrick.

274
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,250
- Do you recognize these names? - Yes, I do.

275
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,080
Then you must know about their movies, "Basic Instinct",

276
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:59,565
"Lust, Caution", and "Eyes Wide Shut" too.

277
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:04,035
I'm not planning to make just an ordinary erotic movie.

278
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:08,935
Would you like to create an international masterpiece with me?

279
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:12,575
We'll go to Cannes together.

280
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:14,375
What do you say?

281
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,395
Seo Jin, it's so nice to be outside, isn't it?

282
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:38,665
Isn't it so refreshing?

283
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:41,330
Not at all.

284
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,475
I'm freezing.

285
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,345
Yoon Ah, I'm so cold. Let's go home now.

286
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:50,300
Hold on. I have something I really want to tell you.

287
00:12:50,306 --> 00:12:51,545
What is it?

288
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:54,115
Hurry. I'm freezing.

289
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:56,515
Seo Jin.

290
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,985
Failure is not falling down...

291
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:02,125
but staying down.

292
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:03,625
What?

293
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,395
Do you see that kid?

294
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:10,490
Trying to fly that kite,

295
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:12,465
he fell so many times.

296
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:15,175
But he never gave up.

297
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:17,775
In the end, he succeeded.

298
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,845
- And? - Just like that kid,

299
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:23,875
even if you fall down, if you keep getting back up,

300
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:28,285
you'll be able to fly like that kite someday.

301
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,155
My gosh. Look how high that kite is flying.

302
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,725
What are you talking about? I'm freezing here.

303
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:38,750
Seo Jin, are you serious?

304
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:40,965
Fine. I'll look.

305
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,965
Why are you making me look at it?

306
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:46,105
My goodness. Seo Jin!

307
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,360
Gosh. Are you okay?

308
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:50,030
Seo Jin, are you all right?

309
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:52,200
- I'm bleeding. - You're bleeding?

310
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:54,175
- Gosh. - What should I do?

311
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:59,070
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

312
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,640
Open the door, will you?

313
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,040
Seo Jin.

314
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:04,425
Forget it! Leave me alone!

315
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,510
I told you to comfort her.

316
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:10,180
Why did you make her look at a kite?

317
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,265
I didn't know this would happen.

318
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:13,920
I'll talk to her again.

319
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:16,535
Forget it. Stay out of it. I'll take care of it.

320
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:18,960
Is it that hard to comfort her?

321
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:21,105
Gosh, I'm so frustrated.

322
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,755
What is it?

323
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:37,415
What is it?

324
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,710
Dong Gu.

325
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:45,020
Why did you wake me up?

326
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,450
I'd like to take you somewhere.

327
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:48,695
Where? At this hour?

328
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:51,165
You'll see. Get up.

329
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,860
I'm sleepy.

330
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:54,775
Where are we going?

331
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:03,675
What are we doing on top of the mountain?

332
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:06,615
I have something...

333
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:09,140
I want to tell you.

334
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:10,385
Something to tell me?

335
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:12,010
What is it?

336
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:15,525
Seo Jin, failure is not falling down...

337
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:18,065
but staying down.

338
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,095
Seo Jin.

339
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:26,605
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west every day.

340
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:29,990
It moves halfway around the world every day...

341
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,545
to rise again.

342
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,975
And?

343
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:37,885
If you keep going,

344
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:41,355
you'll shine like the sun someday.

345
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,585
Do you understand?

346
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:49,955
You brat. Should we go down?

347
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:53,425
Seo Jin, why don't we race?

348
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:55,335
Hurry up.

349
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:01,060
Dong Gu, are you okay?

350
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:02,575
My goodness.

351
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,630
I bumped...

352
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,630
I bumped into a rock.

353
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,915
Why did we come here so early?

354
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,445
Can you stand up?

355
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,310
I can't get up.

356
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:17,255
The rock damaged my cartilage.

357
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:21,625
It hurts.

358
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,865
You told me to get up again after falling.

359
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:28,390
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,090
Don't forget what I said, Seo Jin.

361
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,160
Falling isn't a failure...

362
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:34,230
- Be quiet. - Okay.

363
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,575
Goodness.

364
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,715
I'm sorry, Seo Jin. Don't be upset.

365
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:46,200
What I did was wrong.

366
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,510
You gave me such a hard time.

367
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,485
It really hurt.

368
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:53,425
My knee cartilage...

369
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,450
was stabbed by a rock.

370
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:56,625
Be quiet.

371
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:59,965
Neither of you do anything right.

372
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,620
I'll make Seo Jin feel better.

373
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:04,920
Stay out of it.

374
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:06,820
Don't you understand her at all?

375
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,305
It's not hard to cheer her up.

376
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:13,145
You're such amateurs.

377
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:26,655
What is it this time?

378
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:29,525
What?

379
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:33,665
Get up. There's a place we must go.

380
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:35,895
Where?

381
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,060
Why won't anyone leave me alone?

382
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,605
You'll find out where it is.

383
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:41,290
Get up now.

384
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:43,475
You're driving me crazy.

385
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,345
I'm not going.

386
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:47,675
Hurry.

387
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:49,645
I don't want to.

388
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:52,415
I won't go. I don't want to go.

389
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:54,715
I don't want to go.

390
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:04,780
Goodness.

391
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:06,965
That startled me. Who is it?

392
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,950
(Sun Woo says "Du Shik.")

393
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,135
It's Sun Woo.

394
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:14,775
Have you had lunch?

395
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,105
Yes, I had...

396
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:18,800
spaghetti.

397
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,505
(I had spaghetti.)

398
00:18:20,636 --> 00:18:22,545
That sounds delicious.

399
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:24,940
I love spaghetti.

400
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,185
How about...

401
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:30,385
we eat spaghetti together next time?

402
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:33,425
Really? I'd love to.

403
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,525
She's so cute.

404
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:40,295
(Writer Bong, I read your script.)

405
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:42,465
What is it? It's the director.

406
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:47,260
Writer Bong, I read your script.

407
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:50,205
However, the erotic scene is too ordinary.

408
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:51,505
Really?

409
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:55,800
I picked out a few erotic scenes...

410
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,645
that may be interesting.

411
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,215
I'll send them to you.

412
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:04,455
Take a look and let me know what kind of scene you'd like.

413
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:08,655
Wait, where did I put them?

414
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:12,120
(Erotic files)

415
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:13,520
Here they are.

416
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:16,450
(Camera roll)

417
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,690
- This one. - Du Shik.

418
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:19,535
Can you recommend me some movies...

419
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:21,230
that you enjoy?

420
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,290
(Can you recommend me some movies that you enjoy?)

421
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:24,475
Send. Okay.

422
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:27,830
These are a few.

423
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:31,070
(These are a few.)

424
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:33,415
This is done.

425
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:36,085
Why isn't Sun Woo answering?

426
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,090
Why...

427
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:52,560
Why did I send these to Sun Woo?

428
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:54,505
Darn it.

429
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,830
She hasn't seen them yet.

430
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,000
Please don't look.

431
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:01,400
Please don't look at them.

432
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:02,615
Du Shik.

433
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,285
Sun Woo.

434
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:07,000
Hello, sir.

435
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,615
Where are you running to like a lunatic?

436
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,070
Is something the matter?

437
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,040
No, I was jogging.

438
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:14,255
The weather's nice today.

439
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,195
Sun Woo, did you read my message yet?

440
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:21,125
Did you send me a message? I haven't checked yet.

441
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:23,690
Dad suggested that we go out to eat.

442
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:26,205
I left my phone at home.

443
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:27,690
I see.

444
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:30,430
Why did you send messages to my daughter?

445
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,630
It's because...

446
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:34,305
I asked him to recommend some good movies.

447
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:37,245
Let's go eat, Dad.

448
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,570
See you later.

449
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:40,815
Okay, see you.

450
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:45,425
Thank goodness.

451
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:48,895
She hasn't seen them yet.

452
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:50,555
Wait.

453
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,865
If they're going out to eat,

454
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,595
their house must be empty.

455
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:01,005
Here we are.

456
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,345
Did you wake me up to go for a drive?

457
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:10,845
Isn't it great?

458
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:14,015
There's also something that I want to tell you.

459
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:15,610
There is?

460
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:18,110
Why does everyone have something to tell me?

461
00:21:18,113 --> 00:21:19,485
What is it?

462
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,755
Listen, Seo Jin.

463
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:26,620
Failure is not falling down.

464
00:21:26,622 --> 00:21:28,465
It is not getting up again?

465
00:21:28,857 --> 00:21:30,050
How did you know?

466
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:31,720
Did the three of you plan it?

467
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:34,235
What is everyone saying since yesterday?

468
00:21:35,697 --> 00:21:37,975
Can't you understand?

469
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:41,745
Seo Jin, take a look at those reeds.

470
00:21:43,572 --> 00:21:46,045
Look at those reeds.

471
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:49,640
They move when the wind blows,

472
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:51,140
but they never fall.

473
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,180
- So what? - What I mean is...

474
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:55,680
if you endure the wind that's blowing now,

475
00:21:55,684 --> 00:21:57,450
you'll get up again like those reeds.

476
00:21:57,452 --> 00:22:00,125
You'll make a beautiful flower bloom.

477
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:02,090
Do you understand what I mean?

478
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,935
Yes, so let's go home.

479
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:06,705
Hey, kid.

480
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:09,190
Do you feel better after hearing what I said?

481
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:12,645
I feel so much better. Please, let's go home now.

482
00:22:12,935 --> 00:22:14,200
Gosh.

483
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:17,215
You're so cute. Let's go home.

484
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:21,515
Here we go.

485
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:23,115
Let's go.

486
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,885
- What's going on? - It's okay.

487
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,610
It's not okay. The car isn't moving.

488
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,025
It's warming up. It's okay.

489
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:37,965
I saw many things

490
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,005
Good job, Jun Ki.

491
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:44,875
What's wrong with this?

492
00:22:46,134 --> 00:22:47,575
Hey, what's going on?

493
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,175
What's going on?

494
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:51,685
Seo Jin, wake up.

495
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:54,545
Take it off. I can't drive properly.

496
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:56,785
You never leave me alone, do you?

497
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,380
What? What's wrong with this?

498
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:00,440
It's broken.

499
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:02,925
Can you remove it? We'll get into an accident.

500
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,250
Goodness.

501
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,065
This car is a mess like you.

502
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:13,705
Good job.

503
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,205
- What's wrong with this? - What?

504
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:19,360
Can you do something?

505
00:23:19,368 --> 00:23:20,545
Wait a minute.

506
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,700
It's going up.

507
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:25,170
It doesn't work.

508
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:27,270
Can you at least pull over?

509
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,510
How can I pull over? There's a truck behind us.

510
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:31,110
Should I stay like this?

511
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,340
Wait, I'll try to pull over. Bear with me.

512
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:34,525
It hurts.

513
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:37,550
How could you do this to me?

514
00:23:37,552 --> 00:23:39,750
Didn't you know that I was like this?

515
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:42,750
What's wrong with seeing another woman?

516
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:44,320
You're overreacting.

517
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:45,905
How can you say that?

518
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:47,665
You jerk.

519
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:49,830
Go ahead and hit me.

520
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:52,100
Hit me, and let's make it a clean breakup.

521
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,475
Go ahead and hit me. I'm ready.

522
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:55,730
Stop crying.

523
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:58,285
Let's make our breakup beautiful. Hit me.

524
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:36,615
Goodness.

525
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:41,125
Why do they live so high up?

526
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:43,810
Is this the sixth floor?

527
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,280
Where's 605?

528
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:47,525
Where is 605?

529
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:49,265
There's 605.

530
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:55,575
Where's Sun Woo's room?

531
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,175
This is the bathroom.

532
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,675
This is his room.

533
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,045
This is it.

534
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:12,525
There it is.

535
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:21,065
Who is it now? Goodness.

536
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:29,975
How could you leave the wallet when we went out to eat?

537
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:31,460
I know.

538
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:33,945
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

539
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:35,945
Sun Woo.

540
00:25:36,738 --> 00:25:39,145
Du Shik said that he sent me a message.

541
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:41,785
- What are these? - What are they?

542
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:45,325
What are these? That punk.

543
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:47,510
He's out of his mind.

544
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:48,695
That punk.

545
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:51,780
No, Du Shik wouldn't do this.

546
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:53,820
He's virtuous and innocent.

547
00:25:53,822 --> 00:25:56,620
How do you keep siding with him?

548
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,505
Do you like him?

549
00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:01,630
Well, I don't like him yet.

550
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,405
What do you mean by you don't? You are totally into him.

551
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:06,260
How can you like someone like that?

552
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:08,300
Why do you care so much?

553
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:10,470
- Give it back to me. - What are you doing now?

554
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:13,415
I'm going to check to see if he made a mistake sending it to me.

555
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,115
"Pick up your phone!"

556
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:31,165
Sir,

557
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:33,935
this is not what you think.

558
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:36,475
Sun Woo, it's not what you think.

559
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:38,805
Let me explain.

560
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:44,530
Why is this in my hand?

561
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,485
What a pervert!

562
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,915
No, I'm not.

563
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,885
Ms. Kang Seo Jin,

564
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:53,080
why did you slap someone's face?

565
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:56,855
It's not like she slapped that person's face.

566
00:26:57,018 --> 00:26:59,380
Her arm was stuck in the window.

567
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:00,695
Does that even make sense to you?

568
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:03,290
Do you have any idea how badly he's injured now?

569
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,965
I'm only telling you the truth.

570
00:27:04,993 --> 00:27:06,435
This is driving me crazy.

571
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:09,630
Why did you slap his face?

572
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:11,290
- He even passed out! - Seo Jin!

573
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:12,505
Seo Jin, are you okay?

574
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:14,100
What happened?

575
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:16,015
What brought you to the police station?

576
00:27:16,204 --> 00:27:18,570
What did you do to her?

577
00:27:18,573 --> 00:27:21,200
I was just driving.

578
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:23,170
- A newspaper got in the way... - What?

579
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:26,585
Her arm was stuck in the window all of a sudden.

580
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:28,980
That's not what I did! That wasn't what you think.

581
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:30,225
Du Shik.

582
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:33,725
- What are you doing here? - Dong Gu!

583
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,220
Let me go!

584
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:37,065
Dong Gu!

585
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,835
Dong Gu.

586
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:40,635
What happened?

587
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:42,990
Please tell them I'm not a pervert.

588
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:44,460
Of course! You are not a pervert.

589
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:47,375
- Who said that? - Look what's going on.

590
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:53,185
Why did you break into someone's house?

591
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:54,885
I don't know.

592
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,815
Please don't ask anything.

593
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,210
Just be happy that it only ended up with the 100m restraining order.

594
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:04,395
You could've ended up getting an ankle monitor.

595
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:09,720
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

596
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:11,520
You know that wasn't my intention.

597
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:14,405
- I just wanted to cheer you up. - When did I ask you for that?

598
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,260
Just leave me alone.

599
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:20,260
I'm stressed as it is. Why are you guys acting like this?

600
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:21,815
I didn't do anything though.

601
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,545
Seo Jin! Seo Jin!

602
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:26,915
I said I'm sorry.

603
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:28,615
How can I make it up to you?

604
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:31,410
I'll do everything you say.

605
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:33,210
I can even die here if you say so.

606
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:35,225
What was that? Strip show?

607
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:38,110
I can even do that here. Just tell me what to do.

608
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,680
- I can do it! - There you go!

609
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:41,890
- Yes! - Alright.

610
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,020
- Do it then. - What do you want?

611
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:45,935
- Do a strip show. - What?

612
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:48,635
Now?

613
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:51,260
Here? In this weather?

614
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:52,945
Why? Can't you do it?

615
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:56,545
Then don't ever talk to me again.

616
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:57,770
Did you get it?

617
00:28:57,772 --> 00:28:59,770
Seo Jin, Seo Jin!

618
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:01,545
Seo Jin!

619
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,955
Seo Jin!

620
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,195
Strip show...

621
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,895
Kang Seo Jin!

622
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:20,465
What!

623
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:28,515
- What? - Dong Gu...

624
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:32,940
What is he doing?

625
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:35,485
Why? You told me to do this.

626
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,585
What are you guys doing?

627
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:42,180
You should do it too.

628
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:43,995
I just got released.

629
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:45,965
Look!

630
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:50,935
Gosh, it's cold.

631
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,535
Seo Jin,

632
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:55,135
there's nothing wrong with you.

633
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:59,300
What's so wrong with slapping a pervert's face?

634
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,530
Don't you agree?

635
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:03,400
I agree. He deserves that.

636
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:06,285
How can you give up your dream just because of someone like him?

637
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:09,840
You'll get a job at a better place soon.

638
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:11,455
- Don't you worry. - He is right!

639
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:14,810
- Yes! - So please cheer up.

640
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,025
He's right.

641
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:20,295
Cheer up, Seo Jin!

642
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:27,605
- Cheer up! - Cheer up!

643
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:33,875
What is wrong with them?

644
00:30:36,337 --> 00:30:37,930
Stop it.

645
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:40,145
People are watching.

646
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:42,240
- She's smiling! - She's feeling better!

647
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:43,555
- We did it! - She's fine now!

648
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:45,225
- Finally! - Yes!

649
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,740
I feel better now. Put your clothes on.

650
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:49,995
- Let's put it back on. - Yes!

651
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,765
What are you doing?

652
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:54,780
- Run! - Run!

653
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,395
This is not what you think!

654
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:13,915
What is he doing?

655
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,085
What a pervert.

656
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:18,385
Sun Woo!

657
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,085
I'm sorry.

658
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,955
I...

659
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:27,195
I have a restraining order of 100m,

660
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:30,050
so I can't go any closer.

661
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:31,395
What is he saying?

662
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:33,765
Sun Woo!

663
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:36,505
I'm sorry.

664
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:40,445
I guess I'm just one of those guys.

665
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:45,315
To be honest, I've been writing a scenario for an erotic movie.

666
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,615
I'm really sorry.

667
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,550
Move quickly.

668
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:59,350
The group of guests will check in shortly.

669
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:00,665
I see.

670
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:04,195
But why are we giving them our rooms even though they are a big group?

671
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:05,720
Where do we sleep then?

672
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:07,905
We can sleep in the living room.

673
00:32:08,163 --> 00:32:10,060
It's been a while since we had a big group of guests.

674
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:13,130
She's right. Just think about the rent we couldn't pay yet.

675
00:32:13,134 --> 00:32:15,100
The landlord called me earlier.

676
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:16,375
Really?

677
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,800
- Didn't she tell us to get out now? - Yes.

678
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,885
That sounds bad.

679
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:25,240
What is he doing by the way? We are really busy today.

680
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:26,485
Can't you see what I'm doing?

681
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:29,710
I'm taking care of myself. It's called mind control.

682
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:31,395
What does he mean by that?

683
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,620
Leave him. It's his first shooting for the soap opera today.

684
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:37,395
He just wants to copy whatever celebrities do.

685
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:38,965
Don't you agree?

686
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:41,390
Yoon Ah?

687
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:42,960
Yes? Why?

688
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:44,975
What's going on? Are you sick?

689
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:49,230
I've been feeling bad since this morning.

690
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:50,475
Really?

691
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:53,245
You are sweating so much.

692
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,615
You are burning up.

693
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:03,625
It's swine flu.

694
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:06,280
- Swine flu? - Swine...

695
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:08,350
You don't have to worry about it too much.

696
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:10,595
You just need to take some pills and rest for a bit.

697
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,035
But it's highly contagious. So you should be separated from others.

698
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:17,090
It's highly contagious? How contagious is it?

699
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:18,730
It's very contagious.

700
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,505
You can catch through her cough or fluids.

701
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:25,745
("A Perfect Room to Recover")

702
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,485
I'm sorry.

703
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,715
We even have so many guests today.

704
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,155
It's okay.

705
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:36,455
At least you'll be fine after taking some medicine and getting rest.

706
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:38,125
What should we do now?

707
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:40,925
What if our guests get the flu?

708
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,190
I know...

709
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,850
She should be separated.

710
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:45,935
But we even gave all of our rooms to the guest.

711
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,705
We have no rooms left.

712
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:50,990
Should we book a motel for her around here?

713
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,100
What?

714
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,860
How can you make a lady to stay at the motel alone?

715
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,600
I can't believe how cold-hearted you are.

716
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:59,945
If you are really worried about her, you can take that mask off.

717
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:02,285
Today's my first shoot.

718
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:04,615
Yoon Ah, you must be okay with this, right?

719
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:05,980
Of course.

720
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,180
I like that.

721
00:34:07,181 --> 00:34:08,825
She can't stay at the motel though.

722
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,525
What if the guest at the motel get the flu too?

723
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:14,295
You are right. What should we do then?

724
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:22,805
Don't you think this is too much?

725
00:34:22,964 --> 00:34:24,390
How can we make someone sick stay here?

726
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,930
Do you have any other idea?

727
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:28,045
Should we cancel the reservation then?

728
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,230
- But this is... - Look.

729
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:32,145
I'm really okay.

730
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,085
I'm not only worried about the guests. I'm also worried about Sol.

731
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:37,840
There's an electric heating blanket in there,

732
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:40,185
and I even installed a heater. So it won't be too cold.

733
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,680
And it's partially your fault for not taking better care of yourself.

734
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,125
Just bear with it a bit even though it's uncomfortable.

735
00:34:45,153 --> 00:34:48,280
How can you be so disgusting like that?

736
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,050
You are cold-hearted.

737
00:34:50,058 --> 00:34:51,435
Close the door!

738
00:34:54,228 --> 00:34:56,835
Wait, what about the bathroom?

739
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,075
I couldn't think about the bathroom.

740
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:13,210
You can't really do this though.

741
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:14,640
He's right about it.

742
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:17,025
You are abusing her right as a human being.

743
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:19,350
How can you make her do this?

744
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:21,025
I'm not doing this because I want it.

745
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,890
Where did you get this by the way?

746
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,535
I borrowed it from the lady at Mi Dal's Snacks.

747
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,035
Mi Dal used to use this.

748
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:32,730
If you push this button, it plays a song. You'll feel less embarrassed.

749
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,130
Oh, right. She'll definitely feel less embarrassed!

750
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:37,100
He is such a cruel person!

751
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:38,545
Stop it.

752
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:41,740
I'm really okay. Please look after Sol for me.

753
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:43,385
Don't worry about Sol, Yoon Ah.

754
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:47,425
The guests will be here shortly. Let's go!

755
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:03,775
They should be here by now.

756
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,305
They'll be here soon.

757
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:07,260
Will Yoon Ah be all right?

758
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:08,870
The weather is so cold. I'm worried about her.

759
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,015
I know.

760
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:12,145
What did you say to her?

761
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:15,070
It's her fault for getting sick, so she should deal with it?

762
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:16,355
What?

763
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:18,940
It's true that she failed to take care of herself.

764
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:19,940
You brat.

765
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:20,980
They're here.

766
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:22,325
- They're here. - They're here.

767
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:23,950
Over here.

768
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:25,950
Seo Jin, please show them to their rooms.

769
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:27,225
Okay.

770
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,795
I'm so happy.

771
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:35,430
Welcome.

772
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,035
Good afternoon.

773
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:38,805
Come on in.

774
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:44,700
It's been long since we had a group reservation.

775
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:45,885
I know.

776
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,145
Dong Gu, like I said...

777
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:50,215
- Hey. - What?

778
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,440
You have a runny nose.

779
00:36:52,447 --> 00:36:53,625
A runny nose?

780
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,095
Why do I suddenly have a runny nose?

781
00:36:57,785 --> 00:36:58,995
Come here.

782
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:00,865
Wait.

783
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,535
You have a fever too.

784
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,235
Could it be...

785
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:08,535
No way. It can't be.

786
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:11,635
- It's not. - Go away!

787
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:13,605
Virus!

788
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:16,515
My gosh.

789
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:20,745
Dong Gu.

790
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,285
Is that a sleeping bag?

791
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:27,055
He's been diagnosed with swine flu too.

792
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:31,625
Go in. Right now.

793
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:34,495
I'm going in. Stop poking me.

794
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:39,365
Why is it taking so long to go in?

795
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:49,600
Did you get it from me?

796
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:51,845
Who else could it be?

797
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,815
I have to film a party tomorrow. I can't believe this.

798
00:37:58,312 --> 00:37:59,485
Gosh.

799
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,665
Turning left.

800
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:12,065
Turning right.

801
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:13,765
Turning right.

802
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,205
Turning right.

803
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:19,205
My voice is hoarse today.

804
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:21,700
Wait.

805
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,575
I hope I didn't catch the flu.

806
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:27,045
This is the first day of shooting. I better do a good job.

807
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:30,985
Gosh. Who is it?

808
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:33,625
My neck. My eyes.

809
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:37,925
Gosh. Seriously.

810
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,525
Why won't it open?

811
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,095
Gosh.

812
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,335
My eyes. My neck.

813
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:47,935
Rebecca.

814
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:50,505
Gosh. Rebecca.

815
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:51,730
Oh, my.

816
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:53,660
Can't you drive better?

817
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:55,900
I'm sorry. I'm a beginner.

818
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:58,070
If you're a bad driver, don't drive.

819
00:38:58,072 --> 00:38:59,800
Gosh, I'm so unlucky.

820
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:02,240
I'm in a hurry. Give me your phone number.

821
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:04,040
Okay.

822
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:05,310
Hurry.

823
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,880
- Give me your business card. - Okay. I'm sorry.

824
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:09,650
You outlaw on the road.

825
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,125
You potential murderer.

826
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:13,625
What were you thinking?

827
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:15,025
My eyes.

828
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,235
Rebecca, don't cry.

829
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:18,695
Rebecca.

830
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,835
Gosh, that outlaw on the road.

831
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:29,845
Good morning.

832
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:31,575
You're here.

833
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:34,070
Your eyes... What's wrong with your neck?

834
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:36,715
I had a minor car accident on the way.

835
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:39,710
But it won't affect the shooting. I'm okay.

836
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:41,285
That's a relief.

837
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:42,580
Did you practice a lot?

838
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,895
Of course.

839
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:46,525
Don't worry.

840
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:49,135
This is why I like you.

841
00:39:49,657 --> 00:39:52,120
Director, Writer Kwon is here.

842
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:53,365
She's here?

843
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:56,530
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

844
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,790
- You've never met her, have you? - No.

845
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:00,775
Let's go. Let me introduce you to her.

846
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,060
- You will? - Yes.

847
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:03,170
Okay.

848
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,515
I'll treasure it...

849
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:10,015
Ms. Kwon.

850
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:11,770
You startled me.

851
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:13,855
You must be busy. What brings you here?

852
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,625
Where did he go?

853
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,635
Who?

854
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,035
Let's go.

855
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,005
Let's take a 10-minute break.

856
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,575
It's that outlaw.

857
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:47,355
Dong Gu, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

858
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,725
Forget it.

859
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:54,365
Yoon Ah.

860
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,335
May I give you a piece of advice?

861
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:00,635
What is it?

862
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:02,365
You're...

863
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:04,905
a bit of a nuisance to others. Do you know that?

864
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,730
I know you don't mean to,

865
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:11,215
but you keep causing others trouble.

866
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:13,645
It's not good.

867
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,285
You might become too used to it.

868
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,655
I'm just concerned about you.

869
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,340
Please don't take it personally.

870
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:23,555
Of course not.

871
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,525
I'll be careful.

872
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:29,820
I hate causing others trouble more than anything.

873
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:33,905
I really don't understand you. Goodness.

874
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:36,075
How do you do that?

875
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:48,915
Over here.

876
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,385
- Hello. - Hello.

877
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:51,815
It's cold, right?

878
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:54,180
- Have a seat. - Okay.

879
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,595
- I'm pushing your chair in. - Thank you.

880
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:02,720
Are you feeling okay?

881
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:05,595
Me? I feel perfectly fine.

882
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:07,620
I feel even healthier...

883
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:09,160
after the accident.

884
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:10,605
I even have more appetite now.

885
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:13,645
That's good.

886
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,600
Why did you want to see me?

887
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:17,815
Well...

888
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:22,315
I was worried if I was too rude to you.

889
00:42:22,877 --> 00:42:25,980
I was so worried...

890
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,125
that I hurt your feelings.

891
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:30,855
Not at all.

892
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:32,395
The thing is,

893
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:35,395
I wasn't in my right mind this morning.

894
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,795
I'm not sure if I should tell you this.

895
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,935
An old friend of mine...

896
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:44,405
died this morning.

897
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:48,145
His name is Kang Dong Gu.

898
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,645
We were like brothers.

899
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:53,615
I see.

900
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,255
Now that I think of it,

901
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,115
he used to come here a lot.

902
00:43:00,047 --> 00:43:01,255
Dong Gu...

903
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:08,695
Here. Have this.

904
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,690
You don't have to do this.

905
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:12,860
No problem.

906
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,235
I just feel too bad. Don't worry.

907
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:19,645
Hold on. Isn't it a bit cold in here?

908
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:21,575
Excuse me.

909
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:24,270
Can we have a blanket?

910
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,615
- Sure. - Okay.

911
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,785
Go ahead.

912
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:38,380
I hope you liked the food.

913
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:39,665
I loved it.

914
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:41,825
That's good.

915
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:45,690
Please forget about...

916
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,290
my mistake this morning.

917
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:48,705
Of course.

918
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:53,575
Take care. Bye.

919
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:56,175
Hold on.

920
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:57,500
What is it?

921
00:43:57,504 --> 00:44:00,570
Do you have a girlfriend?

922
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:03,355
Me? A girlfriend?

923
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:05,985
No, I don't. Why?

924
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:10,155
What? So you decided to date the writer?

925
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:12,125
What could I have done?

926
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:15,750
If I turned her down, she'd hold a grudge against me.

927
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:19,705
I'll just go out with her while shooting the drama.

928
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:23,605
You got yourself in trouble again.

929
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:25,275
Gosh.

930
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,805
Wait. What time is it now?

931
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,085
I brought you dinner.

932
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:39,480
Hey.

933
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,885
I'm busy so I'll be going.

934
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:45,350
That punk. Are we animals?

935
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:48,095
Is it feeding time for us? We're not prisoners.

936
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:51,235
I'll get it.

937
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:54,365
Forget it. I'll get it.

938
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:56,405
Gosh.

939
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,145
Those brats.

940
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,775
Don't they even want to check on us?

941
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,770
Dong Gu.

942
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:11,910
- My back. - Are you okay?

943
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,085
My back.

944
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:16,225
- Dong Gu. - My back.

945
00:45:16,283 --> 00:45:17,695
Are you all right?

946
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:20,525
I'm okay. I'm...

947
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,835
That hurts so much. I can't move.

948
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:35,805
Aren't you going to eat?

949
00:45:35,836 --> 00:45:37,345
I will.

950
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:38,915
Goodness.

951
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:43,655
My lower back hurts.

952
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:47,085
Yoon Ah, can you help me get up?

953
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:50,025
Why?

954
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,950
You said that you don't like to be indebted to someone.

955
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,250
You said that it's impolite...

956
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:55,665
and could become a bad habit.

957
00:45:56,824 --> 00:45:58,495
Forget it.

958
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:00,465
I asked for fun.

959
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:02,565
I'll eat while lying down.

960
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:04,575
Your eyes are so big.

961
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:08,245
Why doesn't it work?

962
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,245
Shall I feed you?

963
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,515
- No thanks. - Fine.

964
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:26,425
You can feed me if you really want to.

965
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:41,500
Yoon Ah, as I told you,

966
00:46:41,502 --> 00:46:44,515
I don't like to ask people favors.

967
00:46:44,772 --> 00:46:46,645
So don't misunderstand...

968
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:49,855
Water.

969
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:51,955
Here you go.

970
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:57,795
I almost died.

971
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:04,390
I'm not usually indebted to people.

972
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:05,665
I understand.

973
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:07,635
I understand, so just eat.

974
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:10,705
Yoon Ah.

975
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:13,375
Can you give me some ham...

976
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:15,005
wrapped in dried laver?

977
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:17,475
I had two spoons of rice already.

978
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,525
I have to pee.

979
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:33,795
Did I drink too much water?

980
00:47:34,555 --> 00:47:36,065
My goodness.

981
00:47:58,745 --> 00:47:59,955
Gosh.

982
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:03,010
- Dong Gu, are you okay? - Yes.

983
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:05,155
Where are you going?

984
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,195
I want to get some fresh air.

985
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:10,165
No way. You aren't well.

986
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:11,835
Lie back down.

987
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:18,735
I want to pee.

988
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,175
What?

989
00:48:21,702 --> 00:48:24,245
I want to pee.

990
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,945
- Pardon? - I want to pee.

991
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:30,785
We're almost there. We'll stop.

992
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:35,185
Go down straight.

993
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:40,925
There you go.

994
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:45,635
Dong Gu, can you unzip your pants?

995
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,690
Of course, I can unzip myself.

996
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:50,060
Who do you think I am?

997
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:52,190
Didn't I tell you that...

998
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,575
I don't bother people?

999
00:48:55,669 --> 00:48:57,445
I'm fine, so you may leave.

1000
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:10,425
She'll hear me from inside the tent.

1001
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:12,555
Goodness.

1002
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:37,915
Yes.

1003
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:40,455
Yes, Hye Jin.

1004
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:44,595
See you in the evening.

1005
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:48,295
Okay, bye.

1006
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:50,935
Gosh, it's hot.

1007
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,290
It's not like you're dating for the first time.

1008
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:54,960
How can you stay on the phone all night?

1009
00:49:54,962 --> 00:49:57,505
What can I do? She wouldn't hang up.

1010
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:01,445
Do you know what she said before hanging up?

1011
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,370
She wants to discuss more details in person.

1012
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,770
Doesn't she write scripts as a writer?

1013
00:50:06,773 --> 00:50:09,400
What? Are you going on another date today?

1014
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:10,655
Yes.

1015
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:12,955
Why is life so hard?

1016
00:50:13,313 --> 00:50:14,655
Do I have to...

1017
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:17,725
It's the director.

1018
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:20,025
Hello, this is Jun Ki.

1019
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:22,825
Yes.

1020
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:25,095
Right now?

1021
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:32,535
Why are you drinking so much in the morning?

1022
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:34,405
Did something happen?

1023
00:50:35,302 --> 00:50:37,745
I had a fight with my girlfriend recently.

1024
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:39,175
She said that...

1025
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:42,815
we should take some time to think.

1026
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,455
I think she fell for another man.

1027
00:50:45,512 --> 00:50:46,755
Pardon?

1028
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,455
How can she be so harsh?

1029
00:50:49,683 --> 00:50:52,680
I didn't know that you had a girlfriend.

1030
00:50:52,686 --> 00:50:54,825
- This is a secret. - Okay.

1031
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:56,650
Don't tell anyone.

1032
00:50:56,657 --> 00:50:57,935
Okay.

1033
00:50:58,091 --> 00:50:59,335
It's Writer Kwon.

1034
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:06,235
Writer Kwon?

1035
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,175
Do you mean the one who's writing the drama script?

1036
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:11,475
Yes, just wait and see.

1037
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:13,185
Whoever it is,

1038
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:15,845
I'll do something about him.

1039
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:17,685
What? How...

1040
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:21,655
I'll find him no matter what.

1041
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:25,295
I'll beat him up.

1042
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:30,095
What?

1043
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,795
Your director was dating that writer?

1044
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,205
Yes.

1045
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:37,605
What do I do now?

1046
00:51:37,698 --> 00:51:40,745
How did things turn out like this?

1047
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:43,415
Why do you live like this?

1048
00:51:43,804 --> 00:51:45,730
My goodness.

1049
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:46,915
(Writer Kwon)

1050
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:49,285
- Didn't I tell you that... - Be quiet.

1051
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:56,825
Hello, Hye Jin.

1052
00:51:57,084 --> 00:51:59,195
Of course.

1053
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:02,825
I'll be right there.

1054
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:08,565
I'm going on a date with her.

1055
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:13,905
What is he thinking?

1056
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:15,445
I have no idea.

1057
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,345
I wonder how Dong Gu and Yoon Ah are doing.

1058
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:21,785
What if he's giving her a hard time?

1059
00:52:21,842 --> 00:52:23,115
I wonder.

1060
00:52:24,878 --> 00:52:26,185
Blow your nose.

1061
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,840
Do it harder.

1062
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:30,255
Blow your nose.

1063
00:52:31,852 --> 00:52:33,795
Gosh, it's dirty.

1064
00:52:34,721 --> 00:52:38,120
Yoon Ah, let me tell you again.

1065
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:40,120
- I don't bother... - Stop it.

1066
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:41,365
Okay.

1067
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:50,145
Why is your face so dirty?

1068
00:52:50,604 --> 00:52:54,385
Now that Sol is gone, I have a big baby.

1069
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,125
This is it.

1070
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:07,080
This is my house.

1071
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:08,665
I see.

1072
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:11,935
It's late. You should get some rest.

1073
00:53:13,126 --> 00:53:15,135
I don't want to say goodbye.

1074
00:53:16,129 --> 00:53:18,205
Do you want to come in and have some tea?

1075
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:19,660
Tea?

1076
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:22,845
No way. It's okay.

1077
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,200
You must be tired. Go and rest.

1078
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:26,645
It's fine.

1079
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,970
Come in.

1080
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:29,140
- Come on. - No.

1081
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:30,555
Wait. Hold on.

1082
00:53:41,621 --> 00:53:42,925
Pardon me.

1083
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:44,865
- This is my house. - I see.

1084
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,275
Goodness.

1085
00:53:53,867 --> 00:53:57,437
I'll leave after one cup of tea.

1086
00:53:57,437 --> 00:53:58,939
Okay.

1087
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:02,075
Please wait here. I'll bring some coffee.

1088
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,310
Okay.

1089
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:21,728
Who is it?

1090
00:54:22,996 --> 00:54:24,664
Why is he here again?

1091
00:54:24,664 --> 00:54:26,333
Hye Jin, open the door.

1092
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,236
It's me. Open the door.

1093
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:32,339
- Let's talk. - I haven't told you something.

1094
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:34,508
I was seeing someone.

1095
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:36,977
I'll explain everything and end it.

1096
00:54:36,977 --> 00:54:38,144
Don't misunderstand, okay?

1097
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:40,213
No, please don't do it.

1098
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:41,948
Don't do anything.

1099
00:54:42,215 --> 00:54:44,784
Hye Jin, won't you open the door?

1100
00:54:44,784 --> 00:54:46,052
I know...

1101
00:54:47,754 --> 00:54:48,855
you're inside.

1102
00:54:48,855 --> 00:54:50,690
I saw you entering the house...

1103
00:54:50,857 --> 00:54:52,392
with that jerk.

1104
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:54,895
Don't worry. It won't hurt you.

1105
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:55,996
It'll hurt me.

1106
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:58,331
Please don't do anything. I beg you. Please.

1107
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,799
If you insist on behaving this way,

1108
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:02,502
I'll just have to open the door myself.

1109
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:05,238
Don't open the door. Please don't. Don't open it.

1110
00:55:13,747 --> 00:55:16,149
Hold on. What on earth do you think you're doing?

1111
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:18,618
Gosh. You reek of alcohol.

1112
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:19,986
Have you been drinking again?

1113
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:21,388
That's right. So what?

1114
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:24,057
Anyway, where's that jerk?

1115
00:55:24,357 --> 00:55:25,659
Where is he?

1116
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:27,394
What's wrong with you?

1117
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:30,397
Who are you to care who I date or not?

1118
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:32,299
Where did you hide that jerk?

1119
00:55:32,766 --> 00:55:34,467
Let me see how great he is.

1120
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:38,305
He's in here, isn't he?

1121
00:55:38,305 --> 00:55:39,639
This is driving me crazy.

1122
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,641
Open up, you jerk.

1123
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:45,779
Open up. If you don't, I'll break in.

1124
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:50,050
What? Where is he?

1125
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:53,219
Come out. Come out.

1126
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,857
Where do you think you're going? Stop right there.

1127
00:55:58,124 --> 00:55:59,259
Stop right there.

1128
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:03,663
Oh, my gosh.

1129
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:09,002
You jerk. I finally got you.

1130
00:56:09,669 --> 00:56:11,638
How dare you steal my girlfriend?

1131
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:13,773
I've got to see what you look like with my own eyes.

1132
00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:15,609
- No. - Get this out of the way.

1133
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:18,945
I'm telling you. Get this out of the way.

1134
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:20,680
Gosh. Darn it.

1135
00:56:21,147 --> 00:56:22,282
What's wrong with you?

1136
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:24,851
Open up.

1137
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:30,090
You...

1138
00:56:30,924 --> 00:56:32,158
You scumbag.

1139
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:35,862
Hello, director.

1140
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,897
It's me, Lee Jun Ki.

1141
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:42,235
What's going on? It was you who's dating Writer Kwon?

1142
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:43,236
There's been a misunderstanding.

1143
00:56:43,236 --> 00:56:45,739
There was a car accident between her and I.

1144
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:48,375
Suddenly, she insisted we start dating. It was against my will.

1145
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:49,809
Hold on. Please listen.

1146
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:52,312
I don't like her.

1147
00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:54,314
She's not even my type.

1148
00:56:54,314 --> 00:56:55,482
- It's the truth. - Jun Ki.

1149
00:56:58,284 --> 00:56:59,452
Writer Kwon.

1150
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:01,488
It's not what you think. Please let me explain.

1151
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:03,156
Director. You've got it all wrong.

1152
00:57:03,156 --> 00:57:05,859
Director, so what I'm trying to say is...

1153
00:57:05,859 --> 00:57:07,927
Director. Writer Kwon. No, Writer Kwon.

1154
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:11,464
I'm the director, you idiot. I'm the director.

1155
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:14,067
My name is Lee Jun Ki, sir.

1156
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:15,368
Come here, you jerk.

1157
00:57:18,004 --> 00:57:21,007
Loser. Why do you live like that?

1158
00:57:22,676 --> 00:57:25,078
How did I know something like this would happen?

1159
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:29,315
You guys don't think I'll lose my role, right?

1160
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:30,617
I doubt it.

1161
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:33,920
That writer's a pro. I doubt she'd take revenge over this.

1162
00:57:35,055 --> 00:57:37,724
I'll be all right. I won't have to worry, right?

1163
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:39,492
You'll be all right. You'll be fine.

1164
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:43,997
I'll be all right. I'll be all right.

1165
00:57:48,034 --> 00:57:49,969
Dong Gu. Are you all right?

1166
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:55,341
You're fever's getting higher.

1167
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:57,077
I'm all right.

1168
00:57:57,077 --> 00:57:59,713
I'm sure I'll feel better after I get some sleep.

1169
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:19,199
What are you doing up?

1170
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:21,301
I have some studying to do.

1171
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:29,809
You still want to become a pastry chef?

1172
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:32,679
Yes. After all, it's my dream.

1173
00:58:33,713 --> 00:58:37,350
And for Sol's sake, I won't give up.

1174
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:39,352
You sure are stubborn.

1175
00:58:41,454 --> 00:58:43,857
Yoon Ah. Could you please pass me my cell phone?

1176
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:48,328
Hello?

1177
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:50,997
What?

1178
00:58:51,264 --> 00:58:54,434
I don't need a loan. I've already got one to repay.

1179
00:58:54,434 --> 00:58:55,835
Yoon Ah. Just hang up.

1180
00:58:55,835 --> 00:58:57,737
Don't those people even sleep?

1181
00:58:57,904 --> 00:58:59,038
Gosh.

1182
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:03,977
Dong Gu. Who's this?

1183
00:59:05,979 --> 00:59:07,413
That's my mom.

1184
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:09,282
My goodness. She's beautiful.

1185
00:59:10,216 --> 00:59:13,686
I don't think I've ever heard you mention your mother.

1186
00:59:15,955 --> 00:59:17,390
She passed away.

1187
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:22,128
I see.

1188
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:29,602
What type of person was she?

1189
00:59:29,636 --> 00:59:30,837
My mom?

1190
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:35,074
She was stubborn, had a temper,

1191
00:59:35,074 --> 00:59:36,810
and she sure did nag a lot.

1192
00:59:36,943 --> 00:59:39,746
Like you, if she had her mind set on something,

1193
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:42,148
she would never give up.

1194
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:46,119
I got a good beating a lot when I was young.

1195
00:59:46,953 --> 00:59:48,855
She must've been tough lady.

1196
00:59:48,855 --> 00:59:50,957
She had a soft heart though.

1197
00:59:51,558 --> 00:59:55,562
She would stay up taking care of me and applying medicine on my wounds.

1198
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:01,000
Don't you miss her?

1199
01:00:02,735 --> 01:00:04,137
Of course I do.

1200
01:00:05,205 --> 01:00:06,940
I want to see her so much,

1201
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:09,342
but I can't now.

1202
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:16,082
You cough is getting worse.

1203
01:00:17,183 --> 01:00:18,484
Get some sleep, Dong Gu.

1204
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:20,453
I think I should.

1205
01:00:44,344 --> 01:00:45,778
What is this?

1206
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:51,517
Why is this here?

1207
01:00:55,555 --> 01:00:57,690
Could she have possibly...

1208
01:01:02,095 --> 01:01:03,429
Gosh.

1209
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:15,041
I must've dozed off.

1210
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:21,147
I wonder if his fever has gone down.

1211
01:01:25,418 --> 01:01:27,020
It's gone down.

1212
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:29,522
That's a relief.

1213
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:39,699
Dong Gu. Are you asleep?

1214
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:47,206
Dong Gu.

1215
01:01:57,216 --> 01:01:58,418
That's better.

1216
01:01:59,419 --> 01:02:00,987
I nearly died.

1217
01:02:05,124 --> 01:02:06,259
Oh, dear.

1218
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:12,198
It stinks.

1219
01:02:15,234 --> 01:02:17,870
Did you miss me, Sol?

1220
01:02:17,937 --> 01:02:20,340
I missed you, Sol.

1221
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,141
I missed you so much.

1222
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:25,912
I'm sure you guys had a hard time looking after her. I'm sorry.

1223
01:02:25,979 --> 01:02:28,381
That's all right. Don't worry about it.

1224
01:02:29,816 --> 01:02:32,018
It's starting. Jun Ki's drama's about to begin.

1225
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,253
Don't watch it.

1226
01:02:34,253 --> 01:02:36,089
Please don't watch it.

1227
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,424
Why? It's your debut drama. We should see it.

1228
01:02:38,424 --> 01:02:40,460
- Where's the remote? - There he is.

1229
01:02:41,995 --> 01:02:43,096
We've arrived, Chairman.

1230
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:44,230
He's on.

1231
01:02:44,297 --> 01:02:46,199
I won't let them get away with this.

1232
01:02:46,466 --> 01:02:48,201
How dare they try to take away my job?

1233
01:02:48,234 --> 01:02:50,536
I'll show them who they're dealing with at today's board meeting.

1234
01:02:51,504 --> 01:02:53,406
Mr. Kim.

1235
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:54,507
Would you like a piece of candy?

1236
01:02:54,507 --> 01:02:55,508
Where did that come from?

1237
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:56,709
- Thank you, sir. - Don't eat that.

1238
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:10,223
What's going on? Was it the candy?

1239
01:03:11,457 --> 01:03:14,027
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim!

1240
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:16,396
It's a shame he died that way.

1241
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:17,830
Forgive me, Mr. Kim.

1242
01:03:18,498 --> 01:03:21,067
There's nothing we can do. We should move on quickly.

1243
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:23,236
Go ahead and look for a new driver, Mr. Han.

1244
01:03:23,236 --> 01:03:24,470
- Yes, sir. - What?

1245
01:03:24,604 --> 01:03:26,906
That's it? Your role dies after eating a candy?

1246
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:28,107
Are you going to continue coming out?

1247
01:03:28,107 --> 01:03:29,308
No.

1248
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,978
That writer sure can hold a grudge.

1249
01:03:32,078 --> 01:03:34,047
How could she get rid of a character like that?

1250
01:03:38,484 --> 01:03:39,685
Hey. Where were you?

1251
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:41,320
Jun Ki's drama was just on.

1252
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:44,257
I saw it on my cell phone. He died after eating a candy.

1253
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:46,059
Jun Ki.

1254
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:48,628
What kind of candy was it? Was it a mint candy?

1255
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:52,365
What is that important?

1256
01:03:52,365 --> 01:03:55,368
That's right. It was a mint candy. It was a mint candy. Are you happy?

1257
01:03:55,368 --> 01:03:56,502
Really?

1258
01:03:57,236 --> 01:04:00,807
You should blame the candy. Why are you taking it out on me?

1259
01:04:04,977 --> 01:04:07,280
Yoon Ah. This is for you.

1260
01:04:07,413 --> 01:04:08,414
What is this?

1261
01:04:08,414 --> 01:04:10,650
You said you want to become a pastry chef, right?

1262
01:04:10,883 --> 01:04:13,586
You're always studying that book about baking at home.

1263
01:04:13,586 --> 01:04:15,354
Do you think that'll help you become an actual pastry chef?

1264
01:04:15,354 --> 01:04:16,956
You need to go to an institute to prepare to get a license.

1265
01:04:16,956 --> 01:04:19,025
I know that, but I can't afford to attend an institute.

1266
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:20,293
This won't cost you anything.

1267
01:04:20,793 --> 01:04:23,763
I found out there's a system that financially supports single moms.

1268
01:04:23,963 --> 01:04:25,598
- Really? - Yes.

1269
01:04:25,598 --> 01:04:27,500
I also did some research...

1270
01:04:27,567 --> 01:04:29,535
and found out there are some good institutes in the area.

1271
01:04:29,535 --> 01:04:31,604
Let's go and apply for the subsidy tomorrow...

1272
01:04:31,604 --> 01:04:33,039
and check out the institutes.

1273
01:04:33,973 --> 01:04:36,409
Thank you, Dong Gu.

1274
01:04:36,409 --> 01:04:38,177
There you go again.

1275
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:41,047
Stop shedding tears so easily.

1276
01:04:42,115 --> 01:04:44,417
Thank you, Dong Gu.

1277
01:04:47,653 --> 01:04:50,389
What wrong with you? Why are you blushing?

1278
01:04:51,624 --> 01:04:55,228
I'm not blushing.

1279
01:04:55,428 --> 01:04:57,830
She's suffocating me. That's all.

1280
01:04:58,564 --> 01:05:00,399
Why hug me all of a sudden?

1281
01:05:00,766 --> 01:05:02,301
You sure are strange.

1282
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:05,037
Look at you. You're even stuttering.

1283
01:05:05,204 --> 01:05:06,239
What's going on?

1284
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:08,508
Have you grown fond of her after spending a few days...

1285
01:05:08,674 --> 01:05:10,776
- on the roof together? - What are you talking about?

1286
01:05:10,977 --> 01:05:12,879
It's nothing like that!

1287
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:18,818
Gosh.

1288
01:05:18,818 --> 01:05:20,052
He's acting strange.

1289
01:05:20,586 --> 01:05:22,622
Let's watch something else. He died. Why watch this?

1290
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:28,761
Nonsense. Why would I grow fond of her?

1291
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:31,797
Gosh. Why on earth did I blush?

1292
01:05:32,498 --> 01:05:33,799
No way.

1293
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:37,637
That's impossible.

1294
01:05:38,037 --> 01:05:39,639
It can't be.

1295
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:03,196
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1296
01:06:03,196 --> 01:06:04,764
We're taking the same course.

1297
01:06:04,764 --> 01:06:06,465
He said he was going this way, so he gave me a ride home.

1298
01:06:06,465 --> 01:06:07,833
He seems like a great guy.

1299
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:09,435
He's good-looking, and he's gentle.

1300
01:06:09,435 --> 01:06:10,536
You should consider dating him.

1301
01:06:10,536 --> 01:06:12,405
How would you know if he's a great guy?

1302
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:13,906
There's something strange about the look in his eyes.

1303
01:06:13,906 --> 01:06:15,208
Yoon Ah. Watch out for him.

1304
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,475
Dong Gu. Do you have feelings for Yoon Ah?

1305
01:06:16,475 --> 01:06:17,543
Would you like to appear in my movie?

1306
01:06:17,543 --> 01:06:19,946
The innocent and glamorous Shin Soo Jung?

1307
01:06:19,946 --> 01:06:21,147
I'll go it. I'll do the bed scene!

1308
01:06:21,147 --> 01:06:23,149
You promised to lose 20 pounds in one week?

1309
01:06:23,149 --> 01:06:24,217
Ask Seo Jin for help.

1310
01:06:24,217 --> 01:06:25,785
Run Faster.

1311
01:06:25,785 --> 01:06:26,986
Bed scene!

1312
01:06:26,986 --> 01:06:28,387
I won't allow you to walk!

1313
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:31,357
Shin Soo Jung! Bed Scene!

1314
01:06:31,357 --> 01:06:33,426
You'll die at this rate, Jun Ki.

1315
01:06:33,426 --> 01:06:35,328
Hi. I'm here to collect the rent.

1316
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:38,798
These will be put up for auction to cover overdue rent and interest.

1317
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:41,067
Do you want to close your business or get married?

1318
01:06:41,133 --> 01:06:42,235
- A wedding? - A wedding?

1319
01:06:42,235 --> 01:06:45,037
The famous singer Whee Sung agreed to sing at the wedding?

1320
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:48,708
- Kiss the bride! - Kiss the bride!

1321
01:06:48,774 --> 01:06:50,343
Kiss the bride!

1322
01:06:50,743 --> 01:06:51,844
Dong Gu.

1323
01:06:51,844 --> 01:06:54,447
I don't know what to do, Dong Gu.
