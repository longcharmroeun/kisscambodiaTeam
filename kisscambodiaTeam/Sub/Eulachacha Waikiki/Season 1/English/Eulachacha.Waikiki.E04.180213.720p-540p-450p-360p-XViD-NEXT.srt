1
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:14,217
On today's live show, I'm introducing...

2
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:16,253
the nation's favorite pair of jeans.

3
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:19,623
It is a set of three hip-up, stretch skinny jeans.

4
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:22,659
Look at the design. The design is stylish, isn't it?

5
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:24,194
Let's look at the backside.

6
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:25,929
(Hip-up skinny jeans)

7
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,163
What do you think?

8
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:29,432
Doesn't his bottom look like it's about to soar into the sky?

9
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:33,637
It's the power of the cutting-edge technology used in these jeans.

10
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:35,372
The high elasticity...

11
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:37,574
- Gosh, it hurts. - of the material...

12
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:41,678
enables you to exercise in these jeans without discomfort.

13
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:43,179
You don't believe it?

14
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,382
Let's see a demonstration.

15
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,518
Look at this.

16
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:52,355
There's no sign of discomfort while they stretch vigorously.

17
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:54,224
You still can't believe it?

18
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,293
1, 2, 3.

19
00:00:58,295 --> 00:00:59,496
My goodness.

20
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:03,700
- Well... - Darn it.

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,340
The product we have prepared today...

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,208
comes in the colors...

23
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:16,513
blue, black, and sky blue.

24
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:17,647
(Good Work, Today)

25
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:21,651
Please let me pass the screening at least at one place.

26
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:23,853
I'll visit the church and the temple more often.

27
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:27,857
Save us, merciful Buddha. Amen.

28
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:31,394
- Seo Jin, what are you doing? - I'm praying.

29
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:33,430
I just submitted job applications...

30
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,998
to 25 companies.

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,667
Good luck.

32
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:41,438
Oh, it's him. He's such an amazing actor.

33
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,007
What was his name? Lee...

34
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:45,709
Who? Do you mean Deok Hwa?

35
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:48,078
Deok Hwa? Do you know him?

36
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:49,779
He's Jun Ki's dad.

37
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:52,148
- What? He's Jun Ki's dad? - Yes.

38
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:54,184
What a surprise.

39
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:56,886
I should ask Jun Ki for his dad's autograph.

40
00:01:56,886 --> 00:02:00,490
Don't. He doesn't like it when people talk about his dad.

41
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:02,826
- Why? - The thing is,

42
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:04,794
- he... - Okay.

43
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,666
What? What is it?

44
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,801
Is it just me?

45
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:15,071
Were you badmouthing me again?

46
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:17,340
What were you saying, Wolfman?

47
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,475
I wasn't badmouthing you.

48
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:20,510
- Tell me what you were saying. - Guys.

49
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,512
I have amazing news.

50
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:24,180
What's the fuss?

51
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,950
- You're a star now. Look at this. - What?

52
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:30,353
- What is it? - "Who is the guy?"

53
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:31,654
Who are you?

54
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:33,323
What's that?

55
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,759
- Jun Ki... - What is all this?

56
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,227
My goodness.

57
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:39,229
- What is that? - What's going on?

58
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:41,731
What is all that?

59
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,100
The Internet is flooded with pictures of you.

60
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,069
You even have a nickname. Guess what it is.

61
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,837
Pink Boy.

62
00:02:48,304 --> 00:02:49,506
What?

63
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,441
- Look at that. - Stop laughing.

64
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:55,678
Why would they put so much effort into those pictures?

65
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:58,815
Hello.

66
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:01,818
Yes. Okay.

67
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:03,586
That's right.

68
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:05,321
- Sorry? - Pink Boy.

69
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,958
I see. Bye.

70
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:11,728
What was it about?

71
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:14,898
A film company wants to cast me.

72
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:17,167
They said I was impressive.

73
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,702
You? Where did they see you?

74
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:21,371
- On the home shopping channel. - The home shopping channel?

75
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:24,207
Are they talking about Pink Boy?

76
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:26,643
- That's absurd. - Stop saying that word.

77
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:30,880
Here are the scenario and the shooting schedule.

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,284
You want to cast me without an audition?

79
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:37,187
Do you think this is a fraud?

80
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:39,289
No. That's not what I meant.

81
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:42,959
Which role will I be playing?

82
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,728
It's a movie about a mother...

83
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,764
who gets back at her daughter's kidnapper.

84
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:50,366
You'll play an accomplice of the kidnapper.

85
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,935
Will I have lines too?

86
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,403
Yes, although it's not a lot.

87
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,271
You have scenes with the main character.

88
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,740
Who will play the main character?

89
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,942
The main character?

90
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:01,578
Kim Hee Ja.

91
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:02,846
Kim Hee Ja?

92
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:04,681
From "The Desert"?

93
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,116
The nation's greatest actress?

94
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,518
Yes.

95
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:12,355
You should practice a lot, okay?

96
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:14,390
Okay. I'll work hard.

97
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:16,159
Thank you.

98
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,966
What do you think? Does it taste good?

99
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:26,436
Yes, it does.

100
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,906
By the way, are you going to cook something anytime soon?

101
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:33,243
We've been eating muffins for days. I think I'm getting tired...

102
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,811
Just eat it.

103
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:37,313
What if she goes back to rapping?

104
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:39,148
Fine, I'll eat it.

105
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,218
There's a lot. Eat slowly.

106
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:45,555
Guys!

107
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,223
I have amazing news.

108
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,026
I've been cast in a movie.

109
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:51,861
Do you know who I'll be playing opposite?

110
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,130
The nation's greatest actress,

111
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,533
Kim Hee Ja. Can you believe that?

112
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:57,967
- Kim Hee Ja? - Kim Hee Ja? Really?

113
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,537
- What's your role? - I'll be murdered by her.

114
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,639
I knew it. It's a minor role again, right?

115
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,207
But I have lines this time.

116
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:05,942
Anyway, that's great.

117
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,610
Shouldn't we have a party?

118
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,345
With spicy stew and rice...

119
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:12,515
I'm sorry, but I have to go through the scenario.

120
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:13,750
Let's celebrate some other time.

121
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:16,719
- Kim Hee Ja! - I want food.

122
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,521
He's so excited.

123
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:21,190
Du Shik, you dropped your muffin. Eat a new one.

124
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,326
Thank you.

125
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:33,903
Hello.

126
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,573
Gosh, I died because of you.

127
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,308
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:41,611
- Did you practice a lot? - I haven't slept in a week.

129
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:45,381
Where is Ms. Kim?

130
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:46,649
She'll be here soon.

131
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,384
There she is.

132
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,160
It's Kim Hee Ja.

133
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,562
Hello, Ms. Kim.

134
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:07,303
What's with her?

135
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:09,572
She's immersed in her role.

136
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,008
In the movie, her daughter has been kidnapped.

137
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,310
So she's not eating...

138
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,646
or sleeping. She doesn't even go home.

139
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,881
She doesn't want to disturb her emotions.

140
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:20,750
She's incredible.

141
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,453
You... I'll suffocate you.

142
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:28,691
I can see why she is the nation's greatest actress.

143
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:34,297
In this scene, the mother visits the kidnapper's accomplice.

144
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:37,700
Her anger explodes as she finally confronts the culprit.

145
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,936
The accomplice is frightened.

146
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:42,639
While the angry mother wrestles with the accomplice,

147
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,308
she loses control and ends up killing him.

148
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:46,409
Do you understand?

149
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,277
Let's rehearse.

150
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,545
Okay.

151
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,590
Rehearsal, cue.

152
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:04,293
Who is it?

153
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,429
Who is it?

154
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,830
Who...

155
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:10,400
How did you...

156
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:20,376
Where is my daughter? Where's Su Jin?

157
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:21,778
Tell me, you punk.

158
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:24,947
- We're rehearsing. - What? We're rehearsing?

159
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,820
Tell me! Where is my daughter, Su Jin?

160
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:32,288
Tell me!

161
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:33,723
Please stop.

162
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:36,225
Where is my daughter?

163
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,429
Hee Ja, stop.

164
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:42,265
Jun Ki, are you okay? Wake up.

165
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:43,666
Wake up!

166
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:48,838
Are you okay?

167
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:54,243
I saw a white tunnel and dark shadows.

168
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,979
Gosh, that was close.

169
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,249
I'm sorry. I was too immersed.

170
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,952
Are you okay?

171
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:07,390
I'm okay.

172
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,227
Director, let me calm down a little.

173
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,531
This is exhausting.

174
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,067
Gosh, she doesn't know where to stop.

175
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,303
What if the new guy becomes hospitalized too?

176
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,941
- Hospitalized? - The guy before you is in hospital.

177
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,275
He got beaten up by Hee Ja.

178
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,277
- His recovery will take four weeks. - What?

179
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,713
So be careful when she beats you.

180
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:31,948
Okay?

181
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:36,219
Okay.

182
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:42,725
Are you ready, Jun Ki?

183
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,628
Yes, I am.

184
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:47,730
Ready, action.

185
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:52,602
Wait. How did you find me?

186
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,442
Where is my daughter?

187
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:02,712
Where is she? Tell me!

188
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:06,015
Blood?

189
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:08,951
That's metal.

190
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,554
- Gosh. - Where is she?

191
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:18,094
Stop. Stop!

192
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:20,930
Wait.

193
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,332
- No! - Stop!

194
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:32,074
You filmed this?

195
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:33,442
Yes.

196
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:38,281
Oh, that's so pretty.

197
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,483
Look at the baby.

198
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:41,884
He's so cute.

199
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,586
Cute, my foot.

200
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:46,856
After I started on this job, I came to believe...

201
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:48,891
all humans are born evil.

202
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:51,227
Gosh, how can you say that about a baby?

203
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:53,596
You obviously haven't seen a baby throwing a tantrum.

204
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:57,033
The parents ask me to make the baby laugh.

205
00:09:57,033 --> 00:10:01,003
I'm not a comedian or anything. How could I do that?

206
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,839
It's not that hard.

207
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,073
Are you saying it's easy?

208
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,875
It is. Do you want to see?

209
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:07,510
Come here, my girl.

210
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,213
Peekaboo!

211
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:14,517
Peekaboo!

212
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:17,854
Wait.

213
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,288
You made her laugh.

214
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,858
What did you just say?

215
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:24,594
- "Peeka..." What was that? - I said, "peekaboo".

216
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:27,163
"Peekapoo"?

217
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:30,099
- It's "boo". - It's not "poo". It's "boo".

218
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,934
- Like... "foo"? - That's not it.

219
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:34,337
Do, re, mi, fa, sol

220
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:37,006
In that key, say "boo".

221
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,342
Oh, so it's "boo", right?

222
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:41,210
Is there anything else?

223
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,411
Something else?

224
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:45,147
Can you hold Sol for a second?

225
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:47,617
- Come here, Sol. - Here you are.

226
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,386
Oh, Mommy's gone!

227
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,021
Where's Mommy?

228
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:54,690
Here she is!

229
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,327
That... That's fantastic.

230
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:00,196
That's fantastic!

231
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:04,200
"Mommy's gone. Here she is!"

232
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,269
You need to use higher pitch though.

233
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,237
- Use the pitch of ti. - Ti!

234
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:09,605
- Here she is! - Here she is!

235
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:10,706
That's right!

236
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:13,643
Here she is! In the key of ti!

237
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:17,246
- I'm home. - Hi.

238
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:18,581
What happened to you?

239
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:19,882
I got hurt a bit...

240
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:23,085
while filming.

241
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:25,888
What did you film that got you hurt so badly?

242
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,356
Kim Hee Ja was...

243
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:29,592
really into her role at that moment.

244
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:31,160
That doesn't make any sense though.

245
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,662
How could she beat someone this much?

246
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:35,264
She could even kill someone if she concentrates so much once more.

247
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:38,034
I'm okay. It just happened while acting.

248
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,902
I'm okay. I'm...

249
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:46,042
Jun Ki. Jun Ki!

250
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:49,245
Did he just fall asleep?

251
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,747
- Is he breathing? - Goodness.

252
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:55,117
What a great life that is!

253
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:00,923
Two pale white eyeballs with dark shadows...

254
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:06,495
Is he talking in his sleep?

255
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:08,698
- What is he doing? - Are you okay?

256
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:12,034
Why are you doing that? I'm so sorry!

257
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,576
We'll shoot the next scene of the yesterday's one.

258
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:22,345
After killing the accomplice,

259
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:24,947
the mom cries like an insane person.

260
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:27,216
Jun Ki, you shouldn't move at all.

261
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:28,818
- Do you understand? - Yes, I do.

262
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:30,453
Let's do this!

263
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,536
Ready, action!

264
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,078
Where's my daughter?

265
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:59,348
Where's my Su Jin?

266
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:02,685
Where's my daughter, Su Jin?

267
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,787
- Say it! - Please...

268
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:06,789
- Say it! - Please help...

269
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,824
- Where is she? - I...

270
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,701
Where's my daughter?

271
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:21,737
You...

272
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:24,440
Where is she? Say it!

273
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:28,711
Where is she?

274
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,959
Cut! That's what I want!

275
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:46,896
- Goodness. - Amazing.

276
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:49,432
Hee Ja, that was amazing.

277
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:52,868
I got goosebumps just watching at you.

278
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,804
Jun Ki, you did well too.

279
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:58,908
I was afraid you'd move, but you didn't at all.

280
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:00,109
Thank you.

281
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:03,546
I'm sorry, but can I go to the bathroom right now?

282
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:07,716
What do you think about him? Isn't he better than your expectation?

283
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:08,918
He really is.

284
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:11,487
He's good at acting.

285
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,556
And his attitude is quite serious.

286
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,293
Where did you find someone like him?

287
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,261
Well...

288
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:20,863
I found him...

289
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:35,811
That could have killed me!

290
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,514
How could that get into my mouth?

291
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,354
But he said I did well!

292
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:49,191
The world is finally recognizing me.

293
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:51,961
- Hello. - Hi.

294
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,463
- Thank you. - Thanks.

295
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:00,836
Why is he like this today?

296
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:02,938
He hasn't been in a good mood since this morning.

297
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:05,841
Before we start the ceremony, I'll take some pictures of Jang Gun.

298
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:09,712
But Jang Gun is in such a bad mood. What should we do?

299
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm sorry, but...

300
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,314
Do you want me to make him laugh?

301
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:13,782
How did you know that?

302
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:16,452
That's the face everyone makes when they want me to do that.

303
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:17,686
I'll try it.

304
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:21,357
Here I go.

305
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:25,327
Do, re, mi, fa, sol

306
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:27,463
Peekaboo, boo, boo

307
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:32,735
Peekaboo!

308
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:35,771
What are you doing? He's crying even more.

309
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,673
Don't worry. I have one more thing I can try.

310
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:38,807
Jang Gun!

311
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,444
Uncle's gone! Where is he?

312
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:44,280
Here he is!

313
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:46,749
What are you doing?

314
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:48,350
He's having a fit of terror.

315
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:50,653
Jang Gun, it's okay. It's really okay.

316
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:53,556
It's weird. It worked so well when Yoon Ah did the same.

317
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,157
What should I do?

318
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:57,927
Peekaboo!

319
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,563
Peekaboo!

320
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:04,500
Where's Auntie? Where is she?

321
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,001
Here she is!

322
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,404
There you go!

323
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:10,472
What did you do? He's not that difficult.

324
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:13,008
Is this the reason why you made me come all the way from home?

325
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,243
How strange.

326
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:16,545
He was crying a lot when I tried the same thing.

327
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:18,847
You are really good with babies.

328
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,482
Now I'm relieved.

329
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:22,751
Ouch, my stomach...

330
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:24,119
Is it hurting again?

331
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,788
That's it. We should go to the doctor's.

332
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,223
What about Jang Gun?

333
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:29,191
Your mom's almost here too.

334
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:31,760
I'll take care of him. Don't worry and go.

335
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:33,696
Could you do that for us?

336
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:36,865
I'm really sorry, but could you change his clothes too?

337
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:39,201
I will. Don't worry about here.

338
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:40,469
I'll be here with him.

339
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:41,904
Thank you so much.

340
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:43,472
See you soon.

341
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:47,309
He's a weird boy.

342
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:48,877
What did I do so differently?

343
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,746
Babies naturally know...

344
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:52,381
who's evil or not.

345
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,950
Does that mean I'm evil?

346
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,619
- That's now what I exactly meant. - Right.

347
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,654
I'll go to the bathroom. Just keep an eye on the baby.

348
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:06,262
This is so pretty.

349
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,831
I wonder how much this costs.

350
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,368
Oh, I have to change his clothes.

351
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:14,336
Alright.

352
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,907
This is so adorable!

353
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,610
This will look good on Sol too!

354
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,746
Don't you think so, Sol? Look at this.

355
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,818
- You did a great job. - Thank you.

356
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:32,354
You loved it, so what can I say more about that?

357
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,390
Thank you so much, sir.

358
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,392
You did a great job.

359
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:39,361
It was such a successful day!

360
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:41,697
Why don't we have samgyeopsal and soju?

361
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:43,432
- Why not? - I love that idea!

362
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,200
You can go with us.

363
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:47,836
Are you going too, Hee Ja?

364
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,572
Why are you being like that?

365
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:54,510
I'm pretty tired. I think I should go home now.

366
00:17:55,778 --> 00:17:56,912
Hey,

367
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,148
Bye.

368
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,350
What was that? Did I do anything wrong?

369
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,584
Nothing. Don't worry about that.

370
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:05,954
Hee Ja! Hee Ja!

371
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,192
Hee Ja!

372
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:11,960
How can you just go like that?

373
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,163
I just don't feel like eating with everyone.

374
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:15,397
Is it because of what I told you earlier?

375
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:16,565
I hate...

376
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:19,435
someone like him, who's confidence only because of his background.

377
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,170
You know it well too, Hee Ja.

378
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,572
Deok Hwa really helped me a lot when I had hard times.

379
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:26,942
He asked me to work with his son. How can I say no to that?

380
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,277
What does that mean?

381
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:34,149
Jun Ki, this is not what you think.

382
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:36,752
What are you talking about right now?

383
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:42,691
Look at here, Sol.

384
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:45,094
Look how pretty you are!

385
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:47,363
Look at here! That's right.

386
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:48,397
Look!

387
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:50,399
- What are you doing, Yoon Ah? - Oh, my goodness!

388
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,867
Why are you so surprised?

389
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:53,602
Why are you taking pictures of someone else's baby?

390
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:55,704
I thought he was Sol from the distance.

391
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:00,142
Where is Sol?

392
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,378
What's going on, Yoon Ah?

393
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:03,912
It is...

394
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:05,748
What if my clients see?

395
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:06,882
I'm sorry, I was actually...

396
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:09,184
I don't care anymore. Just change her clothes. Now!

397
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:11,553
- Goodness. - Jang Gun!

398
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:15,524
There you are!

399
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:20,162
My little Jang Gun.

400
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:23,031
It's been a while.

401
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:26,402
It's the second time seeing you since you were born.

402
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:28,771
It's all because Grandma's living in America.

403
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,639
He's so handsome.

404
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:32,541
- I know. - He is really calm.

405
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,377
Why did he get so skinny by the way?

406
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,980
His cheeks looked bigger in the pictures.

407
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,615
It's all gone now.

408
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:41,383
I don't think so.

409
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:45,187
By the way, who are you?

410
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:48,590
We are here to take pictures for the 100th-day ceremony.

411
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:50,692
Aren't you tired, Grandma?

412
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:51,760
We'll hold him from now.

413
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,061
Leave it up to me. It's fine.

414
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:57,065
You have no idea how long it's been since I held Jang Gun.

415
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:01,036
He is the eighth-generation only son...

416
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:03,338
of Yumangong clan of the Lees of Gyeongju.

417
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:06,074
His parents went through a lot...

418
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,976
like in vitro fertilization...

419
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:11,013
in order to have him.

420
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,948
We have to interview you, ma'am.

421
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:15,083
You should say something to your grandson.

422
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,151
- Let us take Jang Gun. - I'll hold him.

423
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:17,853
I see. You can interview me while I'm holding him like this.

424
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:19,254
I want to hold him.

425
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:21,457
That's a better picture, isn't it?

426
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,160
You shouldn't. This is insane.

427
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:31,667
Jang Gun, did you poop?

428
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,135
Wait a little.

429
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,604
I'll change your diaper.

430
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:37,906
No, ma'am. Let us do it.

431
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:41,043
- Baby poop smells terrible. - I'll do it.

432
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,412
No, I'll change his diaper.

433
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:47,549
My grandson, shall I take a look at you?

434
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,419
You want to take a look?

435
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:53,789
Let's see, Jang Gun.

436
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,024
Let me take a look.

437
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,893
Let's see.

438
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:04,800
What are you doing?

439
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,736
I know he's only a baby, but you should respect his privacy.

440
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:10,105
Privacy, my foot.

441
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,477
What's wrong with you?

442
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:19,615
Ma'am. Jang Gun is young, but please respect him.

443
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:20,849
You're violating his right.

444
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,051
"Violating his right"?

445
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:24,319
Goodness.

446
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,291
What on earth?

447
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:31,727
Are you trying to be funny?

448
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,562
I had a traumatic experience.

449
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:36,865
When I was young, my grandmother said, "I'll take it off of you."

450
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:39,668
Ever since then, I can't eat anything that looks like it.

451
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:42,804
That's nonsense.

452
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:46,174
- You can't, ma'am. - How dare you?

453
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:48,577
Take your hands off him now.

454
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:50,913
Let go of him.

455
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:52,915
- No way. - Take your hands off.

456
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:54,716
You punk.

457
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,353
- Goodness. - How dare you?

458
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,922
Don't do it, ma'am.

459
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:03,158
You should have let him go when I said so.

460
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:05,861
- Don't do it, ma'am. - Let me see.

461
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,462
Let's take a look...

462
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:24,513
Gosh.

463
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:27,316
What's this?

464
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:29,384
Our Jang Gun...

465
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:33,388
Where is his...

466
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:36,725
- Ma'am. - No, ma'am.

467
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,027
What should we do?

468
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:53,342
What brings you here without calling me?

469
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:54,977
Why did you do it?

470
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:57,312
Why did you do it again?

471
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:59,448
What are you talking about?

472
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:01,283
I heard everything from Director Kim.

473
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:05,020
I asked you not to do that anymore.

474
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,522
I'm doing fine on my own.

475
00:23:07,956 --> 00:23:09,491
Why do you keep doing it?

476
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:12,894
If so, you should do better on your own.

477
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:17,699
I was not at all impressed to see you on a shopping channel.

478
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:21,470
Gosh, that was embarrassing.

479
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:24,039
I asked him a favor.

480
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,543
I felt bad to see my only child having a hard time.

481
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,312
What's wrong with that?

482
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:32,614
I can't be proud of myself.

483
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:34,950
- Why? - It's because I'm your son.

484
00:23:35,884 --> 00:23:37,886
It's because I'm the son of the actor, Lee Deok Hwa,

485
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:39,621
whom I respect the most.

486
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:43,492
That's why I want to be successful...

487
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,194
without your help and be proud.

488
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:50,999
Then I can be proud in front of you.

489
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:56,638
Father, please trust me and let me do it on my own.

490
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:00,709
That's the only thing that I ask of you.

491
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,678
I understand what you mean...

492
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,581
Fine, be on home shopping channels,

493
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:08,417
or keep playing minor roles forever.

494
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:09,885
Do whatever you want.

495
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:11,787
Goodness.

496
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:16,658
By the way, why do you wear pink underwear?

497
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:17,959
You're a man.

498
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:20,529
- It's sexy. - Goodness.

499
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:24,399
Okay, let's go inside.

500
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,835
Why don't we eat together?

501
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:30,338
I can't. I have some work to do. Goodbye.

502
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,976
Jun Ki.

503
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:42,317
Gosh, I raised a good son.

504
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:52,461
I apologize for what happened.

505
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:54,196
You didn't know.

506
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:57,432
Whether I knew it or not, it was all my fault.

507
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:58,900
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:01,903
Thank you for dinner.

509
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:03,705
See you later, sir.

510
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,875
Jun Ki.

511
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,778
Goodness, what a guy.

512
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:15,083
Hey, how's the grandmother?

513
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:18,153
Really? I'm relieved to hear that.

514
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:22,190
I'm sorry about what happened. I'll take responsibility.

515
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:24,526
I'm really sorry.

516
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:25,861
Bye.

517
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,765
What happened? Is everything solved?

518
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:31,833
Yes, I think so.

519
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,136
What were you thinking?

520
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,605
- I'm sorry. - What's the use?

521
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:39,040
You can't do that at someone else's birthday party.

522
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,343
I did it because I was sorry.

523
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,412
I felt bad for Sol.

524
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:52,721
Sol is unlucky to have me as her mom.

525
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:57,793
I couldn't celebrate her birthday.

526
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:00,829
I never bought her...

527
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:03,965
pretty clothes or toys.

528
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:09,104
I just wanted to make her a birthday photo.

529
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,108
I'm very sorry.

530
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,119
Our today's item is...

531
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,556
a smile calibrator that improves your smile.

532
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:32,227
Three minutes of your day will guarantee a natural smile.

533
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:34,029
What do you think after using it?

534
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:38,033
It's easier for me to smile.

535
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,235
Is it easier to smile?

536
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:44,172
Could you tell us in detail how it is easier to smile?

537
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:48,009
- In detail? - Yes.

538
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,277
In detail.

539
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:52,881
I mean...

540
00:26:53,915 --> 00:26:57,018
the corners of my mouth used to sag.

541
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:59,287
However, this makes my lips go up.

542
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:04,292
My smile became more natural.

543
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,232
Gosh, what's this?

544
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,235
Why did she make me talk when it's already difficult?

545
00:27:14,903 --> 00:27:16,371
My jaw hurts.

546
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:21,443
What if people take photos and spread them on the Internet?

547
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:23,278
Darn it.

548
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:28,750
Who is it now?

549
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:31,386
Hello?

550
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:34,155
This is Lee Jun Ki.

551
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:36,858
What?

552
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,060
A meeting?

553
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:54,509
- Excuse me. - Leave it here.

554
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:55,644
Okay.

555
00:27:55,644 --> 00:28:00,048
I just got a call. I'm Lee Jun Ki.

556
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:04,552
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

557
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:05,820
Hello.

558
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:08,657
Why did you call me?

559
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:11,459
I'm starting a morning drama soon.

560
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:13,295
Someone recommended you.

561
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:14,529
Someone recommended me?

562
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:18,300
Who?

563
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:19,834
Who recommended me?

564
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:22,337
- It was me. - She's here.

565
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:26,341
Hello, Ms. Kim.

566
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:27,642
It's nice to meet you.

567
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:29,377
Hello.

568
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:31,212
Why did you recommend me?

569
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:34,549
Director Choi was looking for a new and talented actor who's handsome.

570
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:37,352
You may not be handsome, but you're good at acting.

571
00:28:37,352 --> 00:28:38,787
That's why I recommended you.

572
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:41,289
- Are you not happy? - I am.

573
00:28:42,357 --> 00:28:43,391
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

574
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:45,961
It's up to you to get casted.

575
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:48,029
- Good luck. - Thank you.

576
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,232
Here are the scripts. Pardon?

577
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,635
- Thank you. - I'll call you.

578
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:06,214
Yoon Ah, come outside.

579
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:09,117
What is it?

580
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:11,019
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

581
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,253
Ta-da.

582
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:17,125
(Sol's 100th Day Birthday)

583
00:29:19,694 --> 00:29:21,696
(Happy 100th Day Birthday, Sol.)

584
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:25,500
(Grow up to be a healthy and wise person.)

585
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,369
What's all this?

586
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,972
Do you have to ask? Come here.

587
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:34,376
It's for Sol's 100th day birthday.

588
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:39,180
It's not much, but we made everything.

589
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,082
Please accept it even if you don't like it.

590
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,717
I love it.

591
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:44,953
It's so pretty.

592
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,355
Thank you, everyone.

593
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:50,992
Don't mention it. You should thank Dong Gu.

594
00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:52,961
It was Dong Gu's idea.

595
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,162
Why would you say that?

596
00:29:54,162 --> 00:29:57,332
Is that true? Thank you, Dong Gu.

597
00:29:57,966 --> 00:30:00,635
It's because I don't want you to cause trouble again.

598
00:30:02,437 --> 00:30:04,773
Don't cry so easily.

599
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:07,542
You cry out of habit.

600
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:09,210
I'm sorry.

601
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:11,846
It's so pretty.

602
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:16,084
By the way, there's no cake.

603
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:19,521
It'd be perfect with a cake.

604
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:25,427
The cake has arrived.

605
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:28,329
Of course we prepared a cake.

606
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:30,298
We can't have a party without any cake.

607
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,034
Thank you.

608
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:34,736
There you go again.

609
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:37,372
Seo Jin, light the candles before she starts crying.

610
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:38,506
- Okay. - Hurry.

611
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:40,942
You bought champagne too?

612
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:42,644
That's thoughtful of you.

613
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:44,746
I bought it because I have something to celebrate.

614
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:47,048
- What is it? - I've been...

615
00:30:47,115 --> 00:30:49,317
casted in a morning drama.

616
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:52,320
It's a regular role too.

617
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,755
- Nice. - Really?

618
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:54,756
A regular role? Really?

619
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:57,092
This time, I'm the main character's...

620
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:58,493
driver.

621
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,463
I knew it. It's a minor role again.

622
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:04,032
Let's talk about that later.

623
00:31:04,232 --> 00:31:06,067
- Let's take some pictures first. - Okay.

624
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,602
- Let's take pictures. - Let's do that.

625
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:09,170
Yoon Ah, come here.

626
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,172
Come this way.

627
00:31:11,172 --> 00:31:12,574
Let's take pictures.

628
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:14,776
Guys, gather up.

629
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:17,278
Dong Gu, hurry up.

630
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:18,813
- Smile. - Fine.

631
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:21,683
A picture will be taken in 10 seconds. Put on a smile.

632
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:23,318
- All right. - Hurry up.

633
00:31:23,318 --> 00:31:25,386
Kimchi.

634
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:27,856
- Kimchi. - Kimchi.

635
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:29,357
Hold on.

636
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:32,360
We forgot a ring.

637
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:35,463
It would have been perfect with a ring.

638
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,798
- A ring... - Yoon Ah...

639
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:38,700
Seo Jin, go get a ring.

640
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,368
Why did you buy these?

641
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:42,637
Put away the table.

642
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,305
- Put it away. - No.

643
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:46,107
- Go get a ring. - It's okay.

644
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,883
All right. I'll start.

645
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,755
Turning left.

646
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:02,957
Turning right.

647
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:04,526
Okay.

648
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:06,461
Backing up.

649
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:09,531
That's one version.

650
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,235
Turning left.

651
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,404
Turning right.

652
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:19,541
Okay. Backing up.

653
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:23,545
Which of the two versions was better?

654
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:24,846
Be honest.

655
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:30,151
How are they different? They looked the same.

656
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:31,786
What?

657
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,256
Hey. In the first version,

658
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:36,724
the driver does his best...

659
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:38,293
on whatever task he is given...

660
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:39,894
so that he can become successful.

661
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:41,796
In the second version, the driver is bored and irritated.

662
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:42,931
He does just enough,

663
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:45,767
so he doesn't get on his boss's wrong side.

664
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:49,103
I see.

665
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:50,138
You want to become a director.

666
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:52,040
How can you not tell the difference?

667
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,208
I'm sorry.

668
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,679
This is my first regular role in a drama. I'm so worried.

669
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,813
So am I.

670
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:01,716
Should I have an in-depth interview with a driver?

671
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:04,919
You have only three lines. An interview would be unnecessary.

672
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,888
You're so fussy.

673
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:08,690
Let him do whatever he wants.

674
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,358
What do you know about acting?

675
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:13,061
What's that?

676
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,830
I found an oven on the street. It looked perfectly fine,

677
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,065
so I brought it here.

678
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,866
An oven? Why do you need it?

679
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:21,636
You said I could even sell my bread.

680
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,838
I'm thinking of doing that.

681
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:25,039
Selling your bread?

682
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,474
What about the guesthouse?

683
00:33:26,474 --> 00:33:28,910
I'll do it in my free time.

684
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,979
All right. If you say so.

685
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,013
But...

686
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:34,282
it shouldn't interfere with your work around the guesthouse.

687
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:36,017
Okay. Don't worry.

688
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:37,452
Gosh.

689
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,887
My goodness.

690
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:42,890
I'm sorry.

691

(His and Her Circumstances)

692
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:58,706
(Daeyoung Newspaper)

693
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:01,109
- I got a text. - Check it.

694
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:05,913
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

695
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:08,950
I'm too nervous. Can you check it for me?

696
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,885
Gosh. Okay.

697
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,024
What does it say?

698
00:34:20,528 --> 00:34:21,829
Too bad.

699
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:23,531
Seo Jin.

700
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,035
They want to...

701
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,338
interview you.

702
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,540
You passed the first round of screening!

703
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,475
Really?

704
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,611
Yes. Take a look.

705
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:39,147
(Congratulations on passing the first round.)

706
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:42,483
I passed!

707
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:43,985
You have to pass the interview too.

708
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:45,286
Don't be too excited.

709
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:46,454
Whatever.

710
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:48,723
I really wanted to get into this company.

711
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:49,924
Congratulations.

712
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,059
You will get in.

713
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:54,062
Stop it. You look ugly.

714
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,265
It smells like something's burning.

715
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:59,233
I think it's coming from the kitchen.

716
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:00,935
What is it?

717
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,937
What's that? Why is it smoking so much?

718
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:04,005
What is this?

719
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:05,773
- What's this? - Why is it smoking?

720
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,942
Oh, my. The bread must be burning.

721
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:10,044
- Turn off the oven right now. - Okay.

722
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:13,581
What's wrong? It won't turn off.

723
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:14,782
Gosh.

724
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:17,151
Then unplug it.

725
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,520
It could have been dangerous.

726
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,156
I'm sorry. The timer must be broken.

727
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:24,826
Why would someone throw away something broken?

728
00:35:27,495 --> 00:35:29,197
They must have thrown it away because it's broken.

729
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:30,832
- You're right. - What?

730
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,400
You almost set this house on fire.

731
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,869
Why did you bring the oven here?

732
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,305
Seo Jin passed the screening. Let's have a drink.

733
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:38,940
- Calm down. - Gosh.

734
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,141
- Stop it. - Stop it.

735
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:42,076
- If Seo Jin hadn't passed... - Come on.

736
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:44,112
Gosh, why did she bring the oven here?

737
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:48,182
Yoon Ah, let's go.

738
00:35:48,182 --> 00:35:51,018
Go on. I want to clean up a bit first.

739
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:53,988
Okay. Don't take too long.

740
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:11,639
All right. Let's start.

741
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,107
Spin it. Come on.

742
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:14,409
Let's do this.

743
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:17,845
- Jun Ki. - Jun Ki.

744
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,448
It's me. Okay.

745
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:21,749
Ask me anything.

746
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:23,384
I'll answer honestly.

747
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:24,552
Who wants to ask me a question?

748
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:26,687
Me.

749
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,856
- Let me ask you one. - Sure.

750
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:32,393
When and where did you have your first kiss? And with who?

751
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:36,364
My first kiss... Was it in third grade?

752
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:38,699
It was in second grade.

753
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,102
It was with the girl next door.

754
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,703
We were in the school playground.

755
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:46,073
As we slid down the elephant slide,

756
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:48,342
we passionately...

757
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:52,814
- Si Yeon's lips were hot and... - Stop it.

758
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:53,881
Go upstairs!

759
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,283
I don't want to hear any more.

760
00:36:55,283 --> 00:36:56,684
What happens next?

761
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,686
You asked me. Be quiet.

762
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,221
- Si Yeon? - My feelings got hurt.

763
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:02,757
I cut up some fruit. Have some.

764
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,325
Have you cleaned up the kitchen?

765
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,927
Yes, it's clean now.

766
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:07,795
What about the smoke and the smell?

767
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,797
Don't be so hard on her.

768
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:11,666
- Have a seat. - I'm okay.

769
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,901
Sit down. We're playing the truth game.

770
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,203
Join us.

771
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:17,805
- Sit down. - You say no all the time.

772
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:20,575
- Is it really okay? - Of course.

773
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:22,276
Let's start again.

774
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,812
- Okay. Go. - Let's go.

775
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:26,080
Okay.

776
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:28,382
Yoon Ah was chosen as soon as she began.

777
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:31,319
What naughty question should we ask her?

778
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:32,920
- Yoon Ah. - Me!

779
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,388
Me. Let me ask her.

780
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:35,756
Are you a question machine or something?

781
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,892
There's something I've wanted to ask you.

782
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,927
Really? What is it?

783
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:43,130
Well...

784
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:46,868
What happened between Sol's dad and you?

785
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,609
Why are you asking her that? You're making her uncomfortable.

786
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:56,577
I know you guys are curious too.

787
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:59,213
It's just that no one has had the courage to ask her. Am I wrong?

788
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:01,015
It's okay.

789
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:02,984
It's nothing to hide.

790
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,053
Where do I begin?

791
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:11,993
It's okay.

792
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,961
It's nothing to hide.

793
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:17,031
Where do I begin?

794
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,738
Well... The thing is...

795
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,578
That's what happened.

796
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:33,114
So...

797
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:36,417
You lost your parents in a fire when you were two...

798
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,553
and were sent to your relatives.

799
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,389
Your relatives took away the insurance money...

800
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,990
and sent you to an orphanage.

801
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,191
You were...

802
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:46,661
abused by the director of the orphanage and ran away.

803
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:50,131
You met Sol's dad while you were part-timing.

804
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:52,500
His parents broke you two up,

805
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,735
and you found out you were pregnant...

806
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:56,237
after you broke up.

807
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:01,208
Hold on.

808
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,544
Sol's dad knew you were pregnant...

809
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:05,446
and didn't do anything?

810
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,749
Well, he doesn't know about Sol.

811
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:09,917
Why?

812
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:13,521
- What? - Well...

813
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:18,426
Sol must've woken up. I'm going downstairs.

814
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,031
I feel so bad for her.

815
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:26,667
It must have been so hard.

816
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,437
Dong Gu, you should treat her better.

817
00:39:29,437 --> 00:39:30,738
Stop giving her a hard time.

818
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,140
When did I give her a hard time?

819
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,444
You were harsh to her for almost causing a fire.

820
00:39:36,444 --> 00:39:39,213
I was only telling her to be careful.

821
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,115
- You be careful. - Let's cheer without him.

822
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,817
- Come. Cheers. - Cheers.

823
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:47,755
Life is tough.

824
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:53,561
Guys. Ta-da.

825
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:55,596
How do I look?

826
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:58,399
That's incredible.

827
00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:00,434
It doesn't look good on you.

828
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:02,837
It's hard not to look good in it.

829
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:05,706
I was a fool to ask you.

830
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:07,074
I was kidding.

831
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:09,043
Why are you dressed up?

832
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,645
I have an interview today.

833
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:13,814
Seeing you flippant like that makes me nervous.

834
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:15,950
Don't worry.

835
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:19,120
Shall I start my makeup?

836
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,788
My goodness.

837
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,625
What should I do?

838
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,761
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

839
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:29,363
My interview is coming up soon.

840
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,665
Stop making a fuss.

841
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:32,233
You can change into a new shirt.

842
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:35,336
No, this blouse goes with this jacket.

843
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:37,004
Another blouse won't match.

844
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:39,240
You still have time to wash and dry it.

845
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,474
I should do that.

846
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:47,515
What are you doing, Yoon Ah?

847
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:51,318
- Are you going to sell muffins? - Yes.

848
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:52,553
Do you need our help?

849
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,488
No, I'm almost done.

850
00:40:56,624 --> 00:40:57,892
It's done.

851
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:01,328
Sol must be awake.

852
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:07,968
She's busy taking care of her baby, doing chores, and selling muffins.

853
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:10,271
Her life isn't easy either.

854
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:12,373
You're right.

855
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,710
Is there any way we can help her?

856
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:18,612
I'd like to, but what could we do for her?

857
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,182
We can't get her a husband.

858
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,051
That sounds good.

859
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:25,986
Shall we look for Sol's dad?

860
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:27,755
How could we even look for him?

861
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,691
That's true. How could we?

862
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,331
Isn't it Yoon Ah's phone?

863
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:38,532
I think so.

864
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:40,234
We can look up his number.

865
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:42,436
How would we know which one is his?

866
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,804
We can search.

867
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:47,308
- What's this? - What?

868
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:50,111
Other than our phone numbers, there are only two people...

869
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:51,512
in her contact list.

870
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:54,482
Kim Jun Sung must be him.

871
00:41:54,482 --> 00:41:56,617
- No way. - It can't be Great Wall of China.

872
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:59,420
I mean how do we know that's Sol's dad?

873
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,621
Right.

874
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:03,290
We can call him to find out.

875
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,093
- Are you crazy? Don't do that. - Let me go.

876
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:08,329
- We can try. - You'll cause trouble.

877
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:10,131
My goodness.

878
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:15,836
Hello?

879
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:19,540
Is this Kim Jun Sung's cell phone?

880
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,142
- That's correct. - Stop it.

881
00:42:21,142 --> 00:42:23,878
Do you happen to know Han Yoon Ah?

882
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:27,214
I dated her for a bit. Who's calling?

883
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,984
They were seeing each other. This must be him.

884
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:33,521
This is delivery service.

885
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:36,757
Han Yoon Ah sent you a package.

886
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:39,059
What's your home address?

887
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:41,595
I can't read the address because it was erased by the rain.

888
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:43,130
It's sunny today.

889
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,266
Yes, wait one moment.

890
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,402
35 Dongsan-ro?

891
00:42:48,536 --> 00:42:50,905
I'll send it to you.

892
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,541
This is Sol's dad.

893
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,509
Shall we look up the address?

894
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,378
This is too...

895
00:42:57,378 --> 00:42:59,313
Stay out of it. I'll go alone.

896
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:00,414
You're not loyal at all.

897
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,349
Fine, I'll come with you.

898
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:03,751
Where are you going?

899
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,286
- It's none of your business. - What?

900
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,887
- Loyalty. - What's wrong with you?

901
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:09,023
What trouble will they cause this time?

902
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:12,960
- Are you going out? - I'm going to sell muffins.

903
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,628
Are you serious?

904
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:16,430
Not everyone can sell their products.

905
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,098
I'll give it a try anyway.

906
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:21,302
Wait, do you need me to carry it?

907
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:22,803
No, I can do it myself.

908
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:23,971
See you.

909
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:25,573
It won't be easy alone.

910
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:30,277
Is she going to sell them while holding her baby?

911
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,880
Forget it. It's none of my business.

912
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:41,555
Buy some muffins. These are homemade.

913
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:42,790
Buy muffins.

914
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,327
Buy some muffins. These are homemade.

915
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,896
Hello, these are homemade muffins.

916
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:50,197
Try some.

917
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:57,471
Let's see.

918
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:01,542
Hello.

919
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:03,611
Dong Gu?

920
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:04,879
What brings you here?

921
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:06,814
I saw you while passing by.

922
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,450
How is it going?

923
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:13,087
It doesn't seem like it.

924
00:44:13,454 --> 00:44:15,055
What are you doing?

925
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:17,024
It's hard on you and Sol.

926
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:19,460
Not everyone can sell their products.

927
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,029
You can easily buy muffins at the bakery.

928
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:25,399
Who would buy them on the street?

929
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:27,334
They aren't marketable.

930
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,904
The handwriting looks careless.

931
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:32,940
What kind of names are these?

932
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,009
Why did you name them like that?

933
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:36,410
Didn't I tell you...

934
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:44,051
Yoon Ah, are you crying?

935
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:47,354
I feel bad already because I can't sell them.

936
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:49,723
Now that you said that,

937
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:51,959
I feel terrible.

938
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:56,096
Gosh, no. You shouldn't cry.

939
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:57,498
You're an adult.

940
00:44:58,032 --> 00:45:00,367
- I'm sorry. - Goodness.

941
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,177
People are looking. Stop crying.

942
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:13,314
Gosh.

943
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:17,184
I'll sell them for you.

944
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:19,453
I'll help you, okay?

945
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,889
- Really? - So stop crying.

946
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,191
Okay? Stop crying.

947
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:26,360
I'll stop.

948
00:45:27,494 --> 00:45:29,630
This is the address.

949
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:32,266
This must be it.

950
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,769
No matter how much I think about it, I think this is wrong.

951
00:45:36,003 --> 00:45:37,738
Let's go back.

952
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:39,306
If you want to leave, go by yourself.

953
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:41,742
You have no loyalty. You should be ashamed.

954
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:43,844
Where's the boss?

955
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:45,045
Be careful.

956
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:47,915
- There's the boss. - Wait. Goodness.

957
00:45:50,284 --> 00:45:53,320
- Excuse me, sir. - Yes?

958
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,023
Is this Kim Jun Sung's house?

959
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:57,291
Why do you ask?

960
00:45:57,491 --> 00:46:00,627
We need to talk to him.

961
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,363
This is so annoying.

962
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,298
- Hey. - Yes?

963
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:05,632
Someone is here to see you.

964
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:07,001
- Me? - Yes.

965
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:08,669
Who are you?

966
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,637
- Are you Kim Jun Sung? - Yes.

967
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,873
Hello, I'm Lee Jun Ki.

968
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,276
We have something important to tell you.

969
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,712
Is that so? What is it?

970
00:46:18,712 --> 00:46:21,448
- Do you know... - Honey.

971
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,318
How long will the construction take?

972
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:26,020
We don't have much time left.

973
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:29,490
It'll be over before our wedding, so don't worry.

974
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,859
Who are these people?

975
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:35,295
They came to tell me something.

976
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:36,730
What is it?

977
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,433
Well, I...

978
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:42,536
I came for a part-time job.

979
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:45,205
- Part-time job? - Part-time job?

980
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:47,741
We aren't looking for part-timers.

981
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:50,577
Mr. Choi sent you, didn't he?

982
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:53,647
I complained yesterday that we need more workers.

983
00:46:53,747 --> 00:46:55,115
He finally sent them.

984
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:58,886
Yes, it was... It was Mr. Choi.

985
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:01,522
Then you should come see me instead.

986
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:03,490
Why would you look for Mr. Kim?

987
00:47:03,757 --> 00:47:04,992
Follow me.

988
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:07,194
Okay, sir.

989
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:10,464
What's this all about? What part-time job?

990
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:12,599
I couldn't talk about Yoon Ah in front of his fiancee.

991
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,068
I told you not to come here.

992
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:16,336
- Let's go. - That's a good idea.

993
00:47:20,774 --> 00:47:22,176
Where do you think you're going?

994
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:25,446
Right.

995
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:28,816
You misunderstood.

996
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:30,484
We have a lot to do.

997
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:32,352
What happened was...

998
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:34,988
I...

999
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:36,857
So...

1000
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:38,125
Listen.

1001
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:40,828
- Goodness, follow me. - Gosh.

1002
00:47:40,828 --> 00:47:43,363
- Du Shik. You got it wrong, sir. - Where are you going?

1003
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:45,165
- Sir. - Jun Ki.

1004
00:47:50,104 --> 00:47:52,005
I'm sorry, sir.

1005
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:54,808
What are we doing? How long do we need to do this?

1006
00:47:54,808 --> 00:47:57,311
What can I do? He wouldn't listen.

1007
00:47:58,912 --> 00:48:00,147
See?

1008
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:02,716
- Hurry up. - Fine.

1009
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:03,917
Go now.

1010
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:06,220
Go.

1011
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,988
Follow me.

1012
00:48:11,525 --> 00:48:13,360
Why won't it dry?

1013
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,095
What if I'm late for the interview?

1014
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,397
Excuse me? Is anybody here?

1015
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:19,833
What? Isn't anyone outside?

1016
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:21,301
Darn it.

1017
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:28,742
- What do you want? - I'm sorry.

1018
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:30,110
Can I get an extra towel?

1019
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,745
I'm already busy.

1020
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,581
Where are the others?

1021
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:37,718
Gosh, I'm late.

1022
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:40,554
Hey, I'm busy right now.

1023
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:43,657
- Towels are over there. Go find it. - All right.

1024
00:48:43,657 --> 00:48:46,193
Also, look after the guesthouse while I'm gone, okay?

1025
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:47,861
- Say what? - Do you understand?

1026
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:50,297
Yes, I got it.

1027
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,072
Buy some muffins.

1028
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:01,308
They're delicious.

1029
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:04,545
What are you doing? You should be louder.

1030
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:06,780
I am loud.

1031
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,015
Buy some muffins.

1032
00:49:08,015 --> 00:49:11,518
They're... delicious.

1033
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:13,787
These are homemade muffins.

1034
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:17,124
Let's go back home. No one is buying them.

1035
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:20,460
If I don't sell all of them today, I have to throw them away.

1036
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,629
You sure are stubborn.

1037
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:25,899
Yoon Ah. Just out of curiosity,

1038
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,901
why do you choose to live a hard life?

1039
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,503
What do you mean?

1040
00:49:29,503 --> 00:49:30,904
I'm talking about Sol.

1041
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:34,508
Have you thought about meeting the father and telling him about Sol?

1042
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:35,642
No.

1043
00:49:35,742 --> 00:49:37,544
That's never crossed my mind.

1044
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:39,813
Isn't it tough raising a child on your own?

1045
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,482
Of course it's tough.

1046
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:45,986
I don't want Sol to be the reason for us to get back to together.

1047
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:48,722
He has nothing to do with how I'm living now.

1048
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:50,791
She's my daughter.

1049
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:55,262
I'm going to do my best to raise her well on my own.

1050
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:58,899
That's why I decided to start my own business.

1051
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,337
If you're tired, why don't you go on home first?

1052
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,606
I'm going to stay hear a little longer. You go ahead.

1053
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:06,707
My goodness.

1054
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:10,344
Nonsense. The day's almost over. Why would I leave now?

1055
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,682
Please buy these muffins. Buy these muffins. They're good.

1056
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,051
Buy these muffins. They're delicious.

1057
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:21,755
Please buy these muffins.

1058
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:23,824
Buy these muffins. I've tasted them myself.

1059
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:25,459
They're really good. I wonder why people won't buy them?

1060
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:27,761
These are delicious. Please buy these.

1061
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:29,696
What are you guys doing here?

1062
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:32,332
Pardon? We're selling muffins.

1063
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:33,934
I'm assuming you have a permit to sell these here, right?

1064
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,235
Yes, of course.

1065
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:36,870
Dong Gu here gave me permission.

1066
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,472
I gave her permission.

1067
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:40,040
What seems to be the problem, sir?

1068
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:43,510
This interview is unique isn't it?

1069
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,178
Relax. Don't be nervous.

1070
00:50:45,178 --> 00:50:47,514
Let's enjoy the meal while having a couple of drinks.

1071
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:50,050
- Let's talk casually, all right? - Yes, sir.

1072
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,719
Go ahead and take off your jackets. You can relax.

1073
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:53,920
Yes, sir.

1074
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:01,595
That's strange. My blouse.

1075
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:03,630
Where's my blouse?

1076
00:51:07,534 --> 00:51:10,537
Gosh. I must've lost my mind. I can't believe this.

1077
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,506
What are you doing, Miss Kang?

1078
00:51:12,506 --> 00:51:13,940
I told you to take off your jacket and relax.

1079
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,142
I'm all right, sir.

1080
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:17,077
I'm a bit cold actually.

1081
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:18,745
Is that right?

1082
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:20,747
Do as you please then.

1083
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:24,284
Your meat will be served.

1084
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:31,091
- My goodness. - My goodness.

1085
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:32,826
I'm so sorry. I apologize.

1086
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:35,128
Please give it to me. I'll go wash it out for you.

1087
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:37,664
No. I'll do it.

1088
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:39,433
No. I'll do it. Please give me your jacket.

1089
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:40,567
I told you it's all right.

1090
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:42,602
Please let me take care of it.

1091
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:44,738
I'm fine.

1092
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:47,240
Please just leave.

1093
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:49,042
- Let's go. - Good work.

1094
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:50,177
- Good work. - Good work.

1095
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:51,678
Hey. Hey!

1096
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:53,714
Hurry up and come over here.

1097
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:55,382
You guys did a good job.

1098
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:57,451
Get home safely. Come again tomorrow, okay?

1099
00:51:57,451 --> 00:51:59,252
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1100
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:04,257
Hey. Wait up for me.

1101
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:06,860
Gosh. How much is this?

1102
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,564
The manager doesn't look that nice, but he's generous. Don't you agree?

1103
00:52:10,564 --> 00:52:12,032
Are you that happy?

1104
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:14,067
You sure must be happy that you earned a lot.

1105
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:16,002
What are you doing? Let's go now. I'm exhausted.

1106
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:18,939
- Don't you do that. - Okay, okay, okay.

1107
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,942
By the way, I think I saw the girlfriend leave.

1108
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:23,443
Shall we go and tell him about Yoon Ah?

1109
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:24,711
Jun Ki. Are you crazy?

1110
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:27,547
That guy is getting married soon.

1111
00:52:27,547 --> 00:52:30,384
If he finds out now that he has a baby, what do you think will happen?

1112
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:33,019
His marriage will be called off in no time. Do you understand?

1113
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,621
- What did you just say? - Pardon?

1114
00:52:37,691 --> 00:52:40,327
Yoon Ah gave birth to my child?

1115
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:41,628
Is that really true?

1116
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:50,370
Do you two have boyfriends?

1117
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:53,740
I don't have a boyfriend.

1118
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,809
I don't have one yet either.

1119
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:57,043
Really?

1120
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:01,314
That's a surprise. I think you'd be popular among the guys.

1121
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:05,685
Us guys like glamorous girls like you.

1122
00:53:05,886 --> 00:53:07,053
Excuse me?

1123
00:53:08,722 --> 00:53:09,890
Why are you looking at me like that?

1124
00:53:10,957 --> 00:53:12,225
Would this be sexual harassment?

1125
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:14,294
I'm sorry. I apologize. It was just a joke.

1126
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,030
Females these days scare me.

1127
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,499
I have to watch what I say.

1128
00:53:21,101 --> 00:53:24,704
Please excuse me. I need to go to the restroom.

1129
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:29,443
I can't believe him He's a complete jerk.

1130
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:31,211
Normally, I'd just smack guys like him.

1131
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:35,015
No. Wait.

1132
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:37,517
Seo Jin. You should control your temper.

1133
00:53:37,617 --> 00:53:40,954
You want to get hired this time, right?

1134
00:53:46,526 --> 00:53:48,028
(2018 Daeyoung Newspaper Job Interview)

1135
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,402
Miss Yoon. After this interview,

1136
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:57,737
why don't you and I go somewhere nice and have some more drinks?

1137
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:00,507
Actually, I have plans.

1138
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:01,541
What plans?

1139
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,877
Is it more important than getting this job?

1140
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:06,980
You must not care if you fail the interview.

1141
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:10,016
- It's not that, sir. - Let's just have a couple drinks.

1142
00:54:10,016 --> 00:54:12,452
Don't get me wrong. You just seem like a little sister to me.

1143
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:15,822
Miss Yoon. Don't you want to get hired?

1144
00:54:20,227 --> 00:54:21,862
She said no.

1145
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:23,597
What did you just say?

1146
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,233
What? She seems like a little sister to you?

1147
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:27,901
If you want to drink that badly,

1148
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:30,403
why don't you have your real sister come drink with you?

1149
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:33,473
What? Hey.

1150
00:54:33,573 --> 00:54:35,909
- Have you lost your mind? - Get your hand off me...

1151
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:38,345
when I tell you nicely.

1152
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:40,146
If you don't tell me nicely, what else can you do?

1153
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:42,282
What? Are you going to take a swing at me?

1154
00:54:43,216 --> 00:54:44,317
Then try hitting me.

1155
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:46,753
Go ahead. Hit me.

1156
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,122
Why? You don't have the guts?

1157
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:51,892
Don't try to show off. You should watch who you're dealing with.

1158
00:54:51,892 --> 00:54:54,160
How dare you act rude to me?

1159
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:05,739
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

1160
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,274
If you want to press charges, go right ahead.

1161
00:55:07,274 --> 00:55:09,876
I'll counter-charge you for sexual harassment.

1162
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:13,914
Get up. You don't have to go through an interview like this.

1163
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:15,315
Let go of me.

1164
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:17,217
- Excuse me? - What's wrong with you?

1165
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:20,453
Are you willing to take the blame if I don't pass this interview?

1166
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:24,057
Why did you do such a thing? This can cause me harm as well.

1167
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:27,861
Please forgive me.

1168
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:30,096
Are you injured?

1169
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,233
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

1170
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,901
I'll do it for you.

1171
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:36,503
My goodness.

1172
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:41,308
I'm aching all over.

1173
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,679
Jun Ki. Do you think...

1174
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:47,714
what we did was a mistake?

1175
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:50,717
What do you mean by "we"?

1176
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:54,854
Hey. You're the one that said it. It was you.

1177
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:56,590
What?

1178
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,191
Are you going to act like a jerk?

1179
00:55:58,191 --> 00:55:59,826
Are you going to make me take all the blame?

1180
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:01,728
What did I do? What did I do?

1181
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:03,530
You're the one that told him. You told him.

1182
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,465
You said it with that mouth of yours. You did it. Yes, you.

1183
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:07,000
Have you lost your mind?

1184
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,102
You're a complete jerk. You jerk!

1185
00:56:09,102 --> 00:56:10,770
Jerk? How dare you say such a thing. I'm older than you.

1186
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,105
- What else would I call a jerk? - What? Jerk?

1187
00:56:12,105 --> 00:56:14,274
- You jerk. - You guys are at it again?

1188
00:56:14,307 --> 00:56:15,508
You guys can't stop fighting.

1189
00:56:15,842 --> 00:56:17,110
What happened?

1190
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:19,980
Wash your faces. Wash your faces, will you?

1191
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,148
Welcome home. How come you two came together?

1192
00:56:22,148 --> 00:56:24,184
We met up front.

1193
00:56:24,184 --> 00:56:26,686
Yoon Ah. Did you sell your muffins?

1194
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,089
Well, you see...

1195
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:31,458
She had everything taken away by the control squad.

1196
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:33,927
For illegal peddling and violating the Food Sanitation Act,

1197
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:35,629
she even paid a fine.

1198
00:56:35,662 --> 00:56:38,064
- Really? - It's all my fault.

1199
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:39,633
I should have done research.

1200
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:41,801
- You guys are hungry, right? - Yes.

1201
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:44,104
Sol has fallen asleep. I'll put her in bed,

1202
00:56:44,104 --> 00:56:45,705
and then hurry up and prepare dinner.

1203
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:47,374
All right.

1204
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:50,443
How could you call me a jerk?

1205
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:52,178
How could you give me all the blame?

1206
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:53,446
- You jerk. - You did it.

1207
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:54,781
You asked me to go. Now you blame me?

1208
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:55,849
- Is anyone here? - You jerk.

1209
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:57,484
Welcome.

1210
00:56:57,484 --> 00:56:58,652
I know that voice.

1211
00:57:07,827 --> 00:57:09,729
I'm here to meet Han Yoon Ah.

1212
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:12,766
Yoon Ah?

1213
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:14,701
Who might you be?

1214
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:17,303
Jun Sung?

1215
00:57:18,004 --> 00:57:19,172
Yoon Ah.

1216
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:24,644
- What are you doing here? - We need to talk.

1217
00:57:24,644 --> 00:57:27,981
What just happened? What's going on?

1218
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:29,916
- Who is that? - You see,

1219
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:32,352
He's Sol's father.

1220
00:57:32,886 --> 00:57:35,088
What? Sol's father?

1221
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:37,257
How did he know she was here?

1222
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:39,859
Actually, we went to meet him...

1223
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,062
- to tell him about Sol. - What?

1224
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:44,230
Why would you do such a thing? Are you guys crazy?

1225
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,666
Are you crazy? I didn't do anything. He's said everything.

1226
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,035
He must've lost his mind. What are you going to do about Sol?

1227
00:57:49,035 --> 00:57:51,237
How can you do this do me. You're a traitor. You jerk.

1228
00:57:51,237 --> 00:57:53,573
- Jerk? - I told you not to do that.

1229
00:57:53,573 --> 00:57:55,375
That's not what's important right now.

1230
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:57,677
Hurry up. Hurry. Let's follow them.

1231
00:57:57,677 --> 00:58:00,680
Why should we follow them? It's none of our business.

1232
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,915
Hurry up. Let's go.

1233
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,855
What's going on? What are you doing here?

1234
00:58:08,855 --> 00:58:09,989
Yoon Ah.

1235
00:58:10,557 --> 00:58:12,292
Do you intend on ruining my life?

1236
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:15,228
- What? What are you talking about? - Listen to me carefully.

1237
00:58:15,228 --> 00:58:18,364
I'm getting married soon. So here.

1238
00:58:18,398 --> 00:58:20,033
Just take this.

1239
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,203
Take this, and don't contact me again. Do you understand?

1240
00:58:23,203 --> 00:58:25,171
- What? What's he doing? - What is it?

1241
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:27,540
- Wait. What is this? - Isn't this enough?

1242
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,877
I'm sure you planned on earning a fortune. This doesn't satisfy you?

1243
00:58:30,877 --> 00:58:33,113
You should be grateful that I'm even giving you this.

1244
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:36,316
Honestly, how would I know who that child's father really is?

1245
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,952
What on earth is he saying?

1246
00:58:38,952 --> 00:58:41,321
- That jerk. - Dong Gu. Wait.

1247
00:58:41,321 --> 00:58:44,190
How do I know you're not lying just to get money?

1248
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:47,127
What are you talking about? You show up here, and... Gosh!

1249
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:52,866
You jerk. How dare you say such a thing?

1250
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:55,668
Hey. Do you even know how she's living right now?

1251
00:58:55,668 --> 00:58:56,903
I can't believe his temper.

1252
00:58:56,903 --> 00:58:58,471
Did you say she intended on getting lucky?

1253
00:58:58,471 --> 00:59:00,740
Dong Gu. What are you doing?

1254
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,942
A jerk like him doesn't have the right to be Sol's father.

1255
00:59:02,942 --> 00:59:04,878
- Do you know what he deserves? - Wait a minute.

1256
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:07,847
Did you refer to him as Sol's father?

1257
00:59:07,847 --> 00:59:09,716
What on earth are you talking about?

1258
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,484
That guy's not Sol's father.

1259
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:17,457
What? He's not Sol's father?

1260
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:18,792
Then who is he?

1261
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:21,761
He's just a guy I went on a blind date with.

1262
00:59:22,595 --> 00:59:25,465
But why was his number saved on your cellphone.

1263
00:59:25,465 --> 00:59:26,733
It was so that I could block his calls.

1264
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,636
He kept calling and coming to see me after drinking a lot.

1265
00:59:29,636 --> 00:59:31,471
Then why did you come to see her?

1266
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:34,240
On the day of our blind date, I blacked out after drinking with her.

1267
00:59:34,974 --> 00:59:37,710
I thought something could have happened that night.

1268
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:40,413
This is so embarrassing.

1269
00:59:41,147 --> 00:59:44,784
It was crazy of me to have listened to these idiots.

1270
00:59:44,784 --> 00:59:46,352
Gosh. I can't believe you two.

1271
00:59:46,352 --> 00:59:47,554
Wait right there.

1272
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:50,356
Do you think I'll let you get off that easily after hitting me?

1273
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,925
Pardon?

1274
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:55,528
You see,

1275
00:59:56,496 --> 00:59:58,665
I had a job interview today.

1276
00:59:59,499 --> 01:00:01,835
I don't think I have a chance of passing though.

1277
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:03,870
I...

1278
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:09,042
took a piece of pork ribs and slapped the interviewer...

1279
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:10,777
across the face.

1280
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:17,417
He was a complete jerk.

1281
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:19,752
But...

1282
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:23,356
they said I was wrong.

1283
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,226
Apparently,

1284
01:00:27,493 --> 01:00:29,062
I made a mistake.

1285
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:33,032
Honestly,

1286
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,936
I was proud of myself.

1287
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,808
I don't get it.

1288
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:44,777
I don't get it.

1289
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:48,181
I really don't get it.

1290
01:00:56,256 --> 01:00:58,291
I talked too much about myself.

1291
01:00:58,691 --> 01:01:01,461
You seem to have worries yourself.

1292
01:01:01,694 --> 01:01:03,129
Tell me about them.

1293
01:01:03,129 --> 01:01:05,398
I can listen for you.

1294
01:01:12,238 --> 01:01:13,973
But Mister,

1295
01:01:16,376 --> 01:01:18,311
do you not have pants on?

1296
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:22,615
Mister. When doing to an interview, make sure you put pants on.

1297
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:24,884
If you don't, you'll be in big trouble.

1298
01:01:25,084 --> 01:01:28,521
Mister, stop looking ahead. Look at me.

1299
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:30,957
Look at me. I don't have a blouse on.

1300
01:01:31,457 --> 01:01:33,326
Where on earth is my blouse?

1301
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:45,104
My eyes are throbbing.

1302
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:48,274
He sure has a strong fist. Gosh.

1303
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:50,710
This is so embarrassing.

1304
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,578
Gosh. I must've been crazy.

1305
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:55,415
Those two jerks are no good.

1306
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:56,716
Gosh.

1307
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,088
Here you go.

1308
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:15,702
- Does it hurt a lot? - Yes.

1309
01:02:16,235 --> 01:02:17,770
You shouldn't have done that.

1310
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:21,841
I couldn't stand the way that jerk was talking.

1311
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:23,176
What?

1312
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:25,144
Then you did that for me?

1313
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:29,749
For you? It's nothing like that at all.

1314
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:31,284
Never mind then.

1315
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:34,854
Anyway, thank you, Dong Gu.

1316
01:02:35,021 --> 01:02:36,289
For what?

1317
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:38,458
For letting me stay here.

1318
01:02:41,561 --> 01:02:44,330
Before I came here, I was always lonely.

1319
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,534
But I don't feel that way so much these days.

1320
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:52,071
I have people that worry about me now.

1321
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:57,010
I've never had family, so I wouldn't know exactly,

1322
01:02:57,877 --> 01:03:02,115
but if I did have a family, I think this is how it would feel like.

1323
01:03:02,448 --> 01:03:05,184
If you're grateful, try to get you work done well.

1324
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:07,854
You sure can't stop giving me a hard time.

1325
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:12,592
Do you think that bruise will actually go away that way?

1326
01:03:12,692 --> 01:03:15,328
- Give it to me. I'll help you. - No. That's okay.

1327
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:17,096
Give it to me. I'll do it for you.

1328
01:03:17,096 --> 01:03:18,197
I'll be all right.

1329
01:03:18,197 --> 01:03:20,933
- Trust me for once, Dong Gu. - Stop it.

1330
01:03:23,603 --> 01:03:24,837
Oh, dear.

1331
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:28,674
I told you that I'd do it! Gosh!

1332
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:31,210
Why can't you do anything right?

1333
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:34,580
I didn't do it on purpose.

1334
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,848
Look at you now.

1335
01:03:36,115 --> 01:03:37,650
Are you talking back at me now?

1336
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:41,954
I treated you well and now you're talking back at me?

1337
01:03:42,321 --> 01:03:44,390
This is partly your fault.

1338
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,725
You always give me a hard time.

1339
01:03:45,725 --> 01:03:47,326
Do you think I don't have a temper?

1340
01:03:47,326 --> 01:03:49,796
You sure do scare me. What did I do wrong?

1341
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:52,065
Let me see that temper of yours. What'll you do?

1342
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:54,634
What'll you do? What do you intend on doing?

1343
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:56,936
- I can really get upset you know. - Go right ahead.

1344
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:58,438
I've been too patient with you, haven't I?

1345
01:03:58,438 --> 01:04:01,774
I wonder what'll happen if you get upset. You know how I am, right?

1346
01:04:01,774 --> 01:04:03,576
You'll really be surprised.

1347
01:04:03,576 --> 01:04:06,012
You'll be even more surprised.

1348
01:04:06,012 --> 01:04:08,047
Why are you so strong?

1349
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:10,216
Why is your head so hard as a rock?

1350
01:04:10,216 --> 01:04:12,185
Did you say a rock? Are you saying I'm stupid?

1351
01:04:13,352 --> 01:04:15,488
(Thanks you Kim Young Ok, Lee Deok Hwa, and Kim Seo Hyung...)

1352
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:16,923
(for their special appearances.)

1353
01:04:25,765 --> 01:04:29,268
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1354
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:30,336
You startled me!

1355
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:32,238
I want to give up my dream of becoming a reporter.

1356
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:35,808
What Seo Jin needs most now is true encouragement.

1357
01:04:35,808 --> 01:04:38,010
If you endure this hard times,

1358
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,413
you'll be sure to earn great results.

1359
01:04:40,413 --> 01:04:42,081
What happened? Why were you brought to the police station?

1360
01:04:42,081 --> 01:04:44,951
Seo Jin. Listen. You did nothing wrong,

1361
01:04:44,951 --> 01:04:46,752
so cheer up!

1362
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:49,689
Jun Ki. I think I've fallen in love.

1363
01:04:49,689 --> 01:04:51,624
I think she really likes me.

1364
01:04:51,624 --> 01:04:52,992
Du Shik. What were you doing?

1365
01:04:52,992 --> 01:04:54,727
I was watching a movie.

1366
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:56,129
- Then let's watch it together. - No!

1367
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:57,797
Why did I send this to Sun Ah?

1368
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,265
Darn it!

1369
01:04:59,265 --> 01:05:00,666
You crazy idiot!

1370
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:02,969
Do you have a girlfriend? What do you think about me?

1371
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,804
She met a new guy.

1372
01:05:04,804 --> 01:05:08,074
I'll make sure I find that jerk and kill him.

1373
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:09,208
The swine flu?

1374
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:11,077
This is all for your mom's sake.

1375
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,645
I worried about your mom.

1376
01:05:12,645 --> 01:05:14,847
Yoon Ah. Do you know that you can be a nuisance?

1377
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:16,749
Yoon Ah. I'd like to ask you out on a date.

1378
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:18,284
- Isn't that Yoon Ah? - Who is that guy?

1379
01:05:18,284 --> 01:05:20,353
Would you like to get kicked out or rather get married?

1380
01:05:20,353 --> 01:05:22,255
- Pardon? A wedding? - A wedding?
