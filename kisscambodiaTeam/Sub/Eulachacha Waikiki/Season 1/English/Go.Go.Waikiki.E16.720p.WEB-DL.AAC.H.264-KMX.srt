<i>[This program is suitable

3
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,368
How long has it been going on?

4
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:37,561
So, you've been
fooling me this entire time?

5
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,892
We didn't want to fool you on purpose.

6
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:42,091
We knew you'd react this way,
so we didn't tell you.

7
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,648
You shouldn't have started it
if you knew I'd react this way.

8
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:48,192
Dong Gu, Joon Ki and I like each other.

9
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:50,018
It's for real, so--

10
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:51,250
Shut up!

11
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:57,286
I can never accept it,
so just know that.

12
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,271
Why not? What's your reason?

13
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,805
Some things just can't happen,
so stop it while you can.

14
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:05,186
No.

15
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,447
Who are you to tell me to stop?

16
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:08,936
I'm an adult too.

17
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,417
I'm not at an age to
need your permission to date.

18
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:15,105
Yeah, Dong Gu.
I can't give up on Seo Jin either.

19
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:17,876
So, you're saying
you will keep on dating?

20
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:19,695
All right.

21
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:23,421
Hey, Kang Seo Jin.
You are no longer my sister.

22
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,093
You too, Joon Ki.

23
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:27,864
You no longer exist to me, got it?

24
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:30,393
Why go so far?
They like each other.

25
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:33,299
Are you taking sides?
You don't exist to me either.

26
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,314
Why are you being so childish?

27
00:01:35,314 --> 00:01:36,756
Yes, I'm childish. So, what?

28
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:38,909
Whose side are you on, Su Ah? Their side?

29
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,024
Yoon Ah, are you on their side too?

30
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:43,367
What? I'm just...

31
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:45,727
Seeing that you can't answer,
I guess so.

32
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:49,117
All right. Then none of you
exist to me anymore.

33
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:52,432
So don't talk to me or act like
you even know me, okay?

34
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:09,344
<i>[Damned People In Love]</i>

35
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:22,831
Ah, I haven't seen this movie in so long.

36
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:25,521
That scene is romantic no matter
how many times I see it.

37
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:29,885
Yeah, when will I have a love like that?

38
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:34,540
What have you been cleaning
this whole time?

39
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,800
Sneakers that Mal Geum sent me.

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,652
You're a devoted man, aren't you?

41
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:41,813
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

42
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,465
I like them so much
that I can’t wear them.

43
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,987
Goodness.

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,909
Gosh, a moth is going to
fly out of your mouth.

45
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,348
How long have you two been together?

46
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,585
It's been a while.

47
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,033
Sorry we couldn't tell you.

48
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:01,807
It's okay. We know Dong Gu's personality.

49
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,906
I would've hidden it too.
I understand you, Joon Ki.

50
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:07,998
Thanks, Doo Shik. You're the best.

51
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:15,628
Yes, Mullae-dong Ruffian.

52
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,346
I told you I can't play games today.

53
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:20,798
Let me off the hook today.

54
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:24,169
Yes. I'm sorry.

55
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:26,199
Mullae-dong Ruffian?

56
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,457
Ah, a member of my game guild.

57
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,524
We're all supposed to play today.

58
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:33,514
They're throwing a fit
that I have to be there.

59
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,961
What? You have to be there?

60
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:37,681
Are you that important?

61
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:40,032
Hey, you don't know this.

62
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:43,332
Joon Ki may be nothing to look at
in the real world.

63
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:45,385
But he’s a god in the game world.

64
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,951
Some people offer him money
to buy his character.

65
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,271
Really? Then why don't you sell it?

66
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,770
What are you talking about?

67
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,270
- I wouldn't sell it for millions of won.
- What?

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,639
I'll put my character in a USB when I die
and put it in my coffin with me.

69
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,056
- Of course.
- Oh my.

70
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:03,027
I really don't understand it.

71
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,040
Yoon Ah, what about Dong Gu?

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,587
He doesn't feel like eating.

73
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:10,575
He's under his blankets
and won't come out.

74
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:12,838
There goes Kang Dong Gu
with his stubbornness again.

75
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:15,127
He's going too far.

76
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,528
Where are you going, Kang Seo Jin?

77
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,721
Hey, what are you going to do? Hey!

78
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:23,500
Dong Gu, let's talk.

79
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,601
Oh my. The blanket moved on its own.

80
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,036
Is it a ghost?

81
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:32,670
Are you really going to act like this?

82
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,262
Oh my. It moved on its own again.
How could this happen?

83
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,461
Oh, you're going to keep this up?

84
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:44,170
I have my own plans too.

85
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,083
Hey, what are you planning to do?

86
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,569
Listen carefully.

87
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,250
Until you accept my relationship
with Joon Ki, I...

88
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,721
will never shave my face, okay?

89
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,024
What?

90
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,942
You don't like that, do you?

91
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:05,134
Thinking about it drives you crazy.

92
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:09,394
Yeah, let's go to the end
and see who wins.

93
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,204
Hey, Seo Jin. Kang Seo Jin.

94
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,973
Hey, hey, hey!

95
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:19,776
She threatens me with her shaving?

96
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:23,060
Hey, Seo Jin.
What are you talking about?

97
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,800
Why wouldn't you shave?

98
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,620
Don't you know the saying,
an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth?

99
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,889
I have to go up
against Dong Gu in battle.

100
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,560
Sure, that sounds good.

101
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,629
But why won't you shave?

102
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:36,312
Dong Gu hates it a lot
when I don't shave.

103
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:41,173
There is nothing that can
visually strike him as hard as this.

104
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:43,711
What will you do about work?

105
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,435
I can take time off.

106
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:48,737
I will get him to accept us.

107
00:05:48,737 --> 00:05:51,214
Joon Ki, just trust me.

108
00:05:51,214 --> 00:05:53,865
Seo Jin. Seo, Seo...

109
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:56,541
Why would she take time off work
just to grow facial hair?

110
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,668
Why in the world?

111
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:01,086
Hey, am I the only one
who doesn't understand this?

112
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:04,817
Joon Ki, that's Kang Seo Jin,
Kang Dong Gu's little sister.

113
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:07,088
They have the same blood
running through them.

114
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:10,093
- Why don't you break up?
- Shut up!

115
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:13,338
Why is she doing that?

116
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:16,675
What kind of siblings do that?

117
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:19,959
I'm seriously going insane.

118
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:24,168
Philip? His name is Philip?

119
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,016
You said he costs a lot as a model.

120
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,266
We don't have much money.
Do we have to use him?

121
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:35,016
Hey, they call him the Park Bo Gum
of shopping mall modeling.

122
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:38,146
Once Philip wears it,
it will sell out.

123
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:42,357
Park Bo Gum?
How good looking could he be?

124
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:46,985
Oh, Philip. Over here.

125
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:54,892
I was a little late, right?
I had shoots since early morning.

126
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,305
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:56,305 --> 00:07:00,636
It's fine. It's our fault
for being early.

128
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:05,853
Hello. I'm the president of
Soorgio Armhany, Min Su Ah.

129
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:08,694
Have some coffee.

130
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,588
The fragrance is very nice.

131
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:11,682
Really?

132
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,812
I have a severe case of
nasal inflammation.

133
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,177
I can't smell things very well.

134
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,461
Oh, I see.

135
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,737
Oh, bad nasal inflammation.

136
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:25,862
You're a very funny person,
President Min.

137
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:28,651
Ah, excuse me.

138
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:32,507
You have a piece chili pepper
in your teeth.

139
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:35,163
What?

140
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:44,872
Excuse me.

141
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,916
Did you have to say that to my face?

142
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,529
Do you feel better after embarrassing me?

143
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,214
- Ah, that was...
- What?

144
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:56,637
- Uh, that was--
- Forget it.

145
00:07:56,637 --> 00:08:01,035
I'm so offended that
I can't do the shoot today.

146
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:04,115
Wait! I'm sorry if you were offended.

147
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:07,045
President Min doesn't have much sense.

148
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,019
Hurry up and apologize.

149
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,581
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:17,012
Please don't feel bad.
I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.

151
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:21,182
Because of Director Bong...

152
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:23,495
I'll let this go just once.

153
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,817
Thank you.

154
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,056
Come on in.

155
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,322
This is a guest house that we run.
We will do the shoot here.

156
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:38,807
Oh, I see.

157
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:41,961
It's nice and cute.
The interior is nice, as well.

158
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:44,817
I'm glad you think so.
Please go on up first.

159
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,216
All right.

160
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,784
Hey, what is this smell?

161
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,864
Did you fart again? Hold on.

162
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:57,224
Is something in the house rotting?

163
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:00,403
Yeah, where's this smell coming from?

164
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:12,778
What is it?

165
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:15,000
- I think it's coming from there.
- What?

166
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,669
Oh, oh, oh! Wait a minute.

167
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:21,070
Aren't those Philip's shoes?

168
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,349
So, this rotten stench is his foot smell?

169
00:09:23,349 --> 00:09:24,399
I think so.

170
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,277
He looks like a normal person.
Why do his feet smell so bad?

171
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,495
Doesn't he know that his feet smell?

172
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:34,791
He said he has severe nasal inflammation
and he can't smell.

173
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,788
Even so, this would be like
he didn't have a nose at all.

174
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:42,349
Doo Shik, do I have to
do this shoot with him?

175
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,513
Of course.

176
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:46,849
Hey, we have to upload
our new products today.

177
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,975
Don't show any signs of this in front
of Philip and hold it in, okay?

178
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:53,136
Hey, how can I endure a smell this bad?

179
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,356
Didn't you see him before?

180
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:56,515
He caused a scene about
the chili pepper in his teeth.

181
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:58,494
The shoot is over
if we mention his foot odor.

182
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:00,928
Anyway, you have to endure it, okay?

183
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:01,971
Okay.

184
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:03,808
Two, three.

185
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:15,022
Why is she growing out her facial hair?

186
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:17,751
What a thing to be stubborn about.

187
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:22,764
Oh, are we having
fermented soybean stew for lunch?

188
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:25,066
How delicious.

189
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,813
Dong Gu, is it
fermented soybean stew for lunch?

190
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,140
I don't know.

191
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:35,607
Dong Gu, let's talk.

192
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:39,724
Dong Gu, Dong Gu... that punk.

193
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,815
Oh, what is this?
This isn't fermented soybean.

194
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,596
What is this? It smells bad.

195
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:54,288
How dare he try to start
a conversation with me?

196
00:10:55,417 --> 00:11:00,335
I won't ever talk to him
until they say they will break up.

197
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:05,692
The will of a man...

198
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:09,602
I will show them.

199
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,908
There's no toilet paper.

200
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:18,869
Hey, Joon Ki...

201
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,384
Oh, right.

202
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:24,386
I'm not supposed to talk to him.

203
00:11:24,386 --> 00:11:29,455
Oh, my mistake.
I nearly talked to him.

204
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:33,044
What should I do?

205
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:36,764
I don't have socks or a towel.

206
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,171
Dong Gu, talk to me.

207
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:43,058
Where did your T-shirt go?

208
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:44,900
You went in wearing one.

209
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:47,413
What happened?

210
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:49,591
Dong Gu. Hey, Dong Gu.

211
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,904
How strange.

212
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,385
I'm sure he was wearing a T-shirt.

213
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:02,918
It smells. I think it
spread all over the house.

214
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:06,849
Stop it. What if he notices?

215
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:09,754
He's coming. He's coming. Smile.

216
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:14,596
Sorry, sorry. I kept you waiting, right?

217
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:17,138
Shall we get started, then?

218
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,760
Where should I stand?

219
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,921
Oh, where would be a good place?

220
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,311
Oh, yes. Over there.

221
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:25,335
- Over there.
- Yes.

222
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:30,548
As for my pose...

223
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,573
how about this?

224
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:36,662
Yes, that looks great. Yes.

225
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:38,991
But you didn't cuff the pants.

226
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,711
Oh, do I need to cuff them?

227
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:43,278
- How much?
- We'll do it for you.

228
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,658
What are you doing? Go do it for him.

229
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:48,999
- Me?
- Of course. You're the stylist.

230
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:52,107
Do we have to cuff them?
Can't we just take the pictures?

231
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:53,779
Cuffing is the point of them.

232
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,894
What are you doing?
Hurry up. We don't have time.

233
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:57,460
Okay.

234
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:03,869
Okay, we'll do them for you.

235
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:08,288
A little more, little bit more.
Now, the other side.

236
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:17,427
Ah, thank you.

237
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:20,590
Yes, looks good.

238
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,160
Yes, the pose looks good. That's good.

239
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,061
Don't move your feet and stay still.

240
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:27,870
It looks active if I move my feet.

241
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,259
No, no. Your feet look fine.

242
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:30,480
The cuff is the point, right?

243
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,384
Ah, don't move. It looks good.

244
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:36,142
Your feet aren't in the shot.
Don't move.

245
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:45,818
What are they doing up there
that it smells like this?

246
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:49,080
Plugging my nose doesn't help.

247
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,465
Sol.

248
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:55,364
Does it make sense for Joon Ki
and Seo Jin to date?

249
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:58,167
It isn't right, don't you think?

250
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,606
What do you think, huh?

251
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,740
You don't think it's right either, huh?

252
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,107
Why do you think I was so angry?

253
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:07,875
I am so angry.

254
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,369
Those punks, I ought to just...

255
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:13,581
What? Geez.

256
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:15,760
My goodness.

257
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,225
Hold on.

258
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:21,302
Let me see. Oh...

259
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:24,225
These balls. I'd better get out.

260
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:25,893
What is this?

261
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,191
What's wrong here?

262
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:31,037
- Oh no. I can't get out.
- Seriously...

263
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,784
What is this smell here?

264
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,374
What? Why are you in there like that?

265
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,399
You're not stuck, are you?

266
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,124
Goodness.

267
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,841
Do you want some help?

268
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:48,961
You and that stubbornness.

269
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:51,227
Then stay there like that.

270
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:52,727
You scared me!

271
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,533
Seo Jin.

272
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,388
Dong Gu.

273
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:00,576
Are you still not going to accept us?

274
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:01,890
Still?

275
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,004
Oh, is that right?

276
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,287
You still refuse to accept us?

277
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,601
Fine, then.

278
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:13,037
Let's go to the end and see who wins.

279
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:16,346
Seo Jin, Seo Jin!

280
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:18,831
Why is she acting like that?

281
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,831
Dong Gu, how long are you
going to keep this up?

282
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:25,436
Do you hate me dating Seo Jin that much?

283
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:28,381
Fine, do whatever you want.

284
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:31,410
I'll treat you like I don't know you.
Just know that.

285
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,951
Geez!

286
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:35,913
Do that if you want.

287
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:39,274
Do you think I'll accept you two
if you do that?

288
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:42,221
Why can't I get out of this thing anyway?

289
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,868
I have to go to work.
This is crazy.

290
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,129
How embarrassing.

291
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:00,533
Yes, Director.

292
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:03,751
Yes, I'll go to the actors' offices
and go to the meeting.

293
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:05,115
Yes.

294
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:11,131
But, how can I meet the actors
looking like this?

295
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,394
Hello, Mister.

296
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,662
Yes? Oh my!

297
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:23,918
What... what's with you?

298
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:27,032
Sorry to ask you when we just met...

299
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:30,495
but can you cut this off for me?

300
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:34,062
I wrote this script
with you in mind, Jin Woo.

301
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,885
Oh, is that right?

302
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:40,275
Then I can't say no to it, Director.

303
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:41,659
Oh, you.

304
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,811
- Oh my.
- It's all right.

305
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:47,923
- Director.
- Yes.

306
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,326
Unfortunately, we'll have to
go with Seo Jin Woo.

307
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:53,760
Gong Yoo, Hyun Bin,
and of course Won Bin all said no.

308
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,981
Hey, what are you talking about?

309
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,392
That guy can't really act though.

310
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,014
His face is ambiguous and
I heard his personality sucks too.

311
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,304
What do you mean, no?

312
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:07,789
They say he's an obnoxious star
and likes to abuse his power.

313
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:10,347
Oh my.

314
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:12,507
Oh, Seo Jin Woo.

315
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,423
Jin Woo, the thing is....

316
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,387
It's fine.

317
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:22,092
I'll get going since I'm an
obnoxious star who abuses his power.

318
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:23,834
- Goodbye.
- Wait, Jin Woo.

319
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,328
They're just rumors.

320
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:26,871
- Wait.
- Just rumors.

321
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,218
I just...

322
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,510
Hey, are you crazy?

323
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,807
- Sorry, I didn't know he was here.
- Be quiet.

324
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,928
- Go now and get Seo Jin Woo.
- What?

325
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:39,036
If you can't get him,
don't come back and just quit.

326
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:40,805
Hey, just quit.

327
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:42,555
Yes, that's great.

328
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:45,865
That's great. Just one more.

329
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,375
Great. Should we take a break, Philip?

330
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,192
Already? Sure.

331
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:52,402
- I'll go rest.
- Sure.

332
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:53,954
Get some rest.

333
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:56,056
It's nice downstairs.

334
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:02,061
Doo Shik, I can't do it any longer.
I think I'm going to die.

335
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:04,664
You think it's only hard for you?
My nose is all rough inside.

336
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:05,874
Just hold on a bit.

337
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:08,143
I can't hold on any longer.

338
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:09,586
Should we open the window, then?

339
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,192
What if he figures it out because
we suddenly opened the window?

340
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,171
Please just stay put.

341
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:18,493
Then, should I get him to wash his feet?

342
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:21,675
Wash them? How?

343
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:28,424
Excuse me. Have some of this.

344
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:29,913
Thank you.

345
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:32,176
Oh no! Seriously?

346
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:34,626
Oh no. I'm so sorry!

347
00:18:34,626 --> 00:18:38,814
What do we do? It's all wet.

348
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:42,795
You must be all sticky.
You should wash your feet.

349
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,823
No, I don't have much time
until my next booking.

350
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:48,383
Let's just hurry and shoot. Come on.

351
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:51,009
Oh, but still...

352
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:55,597
It's very sticky.
It must be uncomfortable.

353
00:18:55,597 --> 00:18:58,912
You think so? Well, then...

354
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:00,724
I'll just take off my socks.

355
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,863
Here you go. We're almost done.

356
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:13,253
Let's go to the end and keep it up.

357
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:16,000
Let's gather our strength and...

358
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,721
Pow! Let's do it!

359
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:21,862
Let's do it! Let's do it...

360
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,551
Let's do it!

361
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:29,201
Why did you do such a useless thing?

362
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,127
It smells even more.

363
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,388
I didn't think that would happen.
I think I'm going insane.

364
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,511
Why did Seo Jin Woo have to be there?

365
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,528
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

366
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,243
Why was he there?

367
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:52,044
Come on.

368
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:53,065
Joon Ki?

369
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:56,236
Let's play just one round
of the game together.

370
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,654
I told you I can't.

371
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,557
I have to shoot tomorrow,
so I have to go.

372
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:01,625
Hey, you're the guild president.

373
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,493
It's hurtful to treat
the members this way.

374
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:06,595
Excuse me.

375
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:09,673
Dong Gu, what are you doing here?

376
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:12,214
What? You know him, Joon Ki?

377
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:13,787
What?

378
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:16,696
Well, I did know him.

379
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,385
Now, I don't know him.

380
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,188
What does that even mean?

381
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:23,948
Anyway, I have nothing more
to say to you.

382
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,719
Don't bother coming here and leave.

383
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,375
Please don't be like that.

384
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,621
Please give me some time.
Just 10 minutes, no, 1 minute.

385
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:32,933
Gosh, I said no.

386
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,465
- Let's go, Joon Ki.
- Okay.

387
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:36,008
Wait, Seo Jin Woo.

388
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:38,882
Let's go inside, Joon Ki.

389
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:41,318
Seo Jin Woo, Seo Jin Woo...

390
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,890
Read the script just once, please.

391
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,287
Seo Jin Woo!

392
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:50,324
Gosh, I'm going insane.

393
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:53,518
How does Joon Ki know Seo Jin Woo?

394
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,240
Oh, you're here, Yoon Ah.

395
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,811
You're back, Hyun Joon?

396
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:03,304
Did you have a good time at the MT?

397
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:07,755
Yes, what happened that
you had to leave so suddenly?

398
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:10,655
There was a reason we had to go.

399
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:12,505
Hyun Joon, I'll get going now.

400
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,685
- You're leaving already?
- Yes.

401
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:17,576
Dong Gu hasn't been eating
since we got back.

402
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,876
I should get back and
make him something he likes.

403
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:24,525
Do you worry that much?
Dong Gu is not a child.

404
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,306
He is a bit like a child.

405
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,734
Yoon Ah, may I ask you something?

406
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,175
Yes, go ahead.

407
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:36,167
You said that you no longer
want to trust anyone.

408
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,282
That you don't want to get hurt again.

409
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:40,346
Ah... yes.

410
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:43,635
What if there were
a person you could trust?

411
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,786
What if a person appeared
who would never hurt you, Yoon Ah?

412
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,144
What would you do then?

413
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:51,064
That would be nice, but...

414
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:53,214
would a person like that show up?

415
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,365
Why do you suddenly ask?

416
00:21:55,365 --> 00:21:56,785
It's nothing.

417
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,338
I'll get going now.

418
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,625
Hey, hey.

419
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,371
I can still smell it.

420
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,686
Hey, isn't that as bad as sulfur gas?

421
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:24,194
Be quiet. What if he hears us?

422
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:26,174
I just can't bear it anymore.
What do I do?

423
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:28,944
Doo Shik, let's get it done roughly
and get it over with.

424
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:30,394
Roughly?

425
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:32,714
Min Su Ah, are you going to be like this?

426
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:35,865
What... what? What did I do?

427
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:39,276
You said you wanted to do it right
this time and it was your last hope.

428
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,002
But, still...

429
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:42,852
The smell is just too much.

430
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:44,220
Min Su Ah!

431
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,877
Is this all you can amount to?

432
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:49,736
Do you know how many harder things
you'll run into doing business?

433
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:54,191
If you can't bear smelly feet,
then give up on it now!

434
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,748
Min Su Ah,
I'm really disappointed in you.

435
00:22:57,748 --> 00:22:59,587
I'm disappointed.

436
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,438
Doo Shik, I'm sorry.

437
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:04,657
I was thoughtless.

438
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:05,987
Don't be angry, okay?

439
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:10,290
Forget it. You stay here
and I'll finish it.

440
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:27,989
You waited a long time, right?
What are you doing there?

441
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,685
There was a basketball there, so...

442
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:32,624
I was a basketball player
for a brief time when I was younger.

443
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,009
Oh, really?

444
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:35,771
I was the shooter.

445
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,352
I could shoot 100 times
and make 100 baskets.

446
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:42,236
Your form is the most
important part of shooting.

447
00:23:42,236 --> 00:23:44,896
- Would you like to see?
- Sure.

448
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:54,260
Oh! Yeah!

449
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:56,912
Bam.

450
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:59,006
Woohoo! You saw that, right?

451
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:00,941
Would you like to see that again?

452
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,656
W... wait.

453
00:24:03,656 --> 00:24:05,169
Where...

454
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:08,821
Where did you get those sneakers?

455
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:11,998
Oh, these? They were over there.
I just tried them on.

456
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:13,832
These shoes...

457
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:16,013
have great cushioning.

458
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:18,602
They're great for jumping.

459
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:19,945
Woo!

460
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,993
Why do you look like that, Director?

461
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:37,453
<i>Hey, you crazy punk!</i>

462
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:43,273
How dare you put those on your
rotten feet, you stinky feet monster?

463
00:24:43,872 --> 00:24:47,606
Why... why are you acting like this?
Stinky feet monster?

464
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:48,624
You mean me?

465
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:51,287
Of course, you.
You think it's me? You tall idiot!

466
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:53,972
I've never seen such a shameless person.

467
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:56,160
Do you know how severe
your foot smell is?

468
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,848
Your feet are totally rotten.
Do you know that, you punk?

469
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:00,962
Your feet smell no better than a sewer.

470
00:25:00,962 --> 00:25:03,251
No, they smell worse than fermented tofu!

471
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,964
And you dare to put those rotten feet

472
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:08,715
into the shoes
my first love gave me, you punk?

473
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,517
You should cut your feet off!

474
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:14,521
I'll poke your eyes out!

475
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:16,540
I'll beat you.

476
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,838
Because of you, I...

477
00:25:18,838 --> 00:25:20,378
<i>You haven't met Seo Jin Woo yet?</i>

478
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:21,969
<i>What are you doing?</i>

479
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:24,196
I'll resolve this somehow--

480
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:26,453
Director, Director?

481
00:25:27,622 --> 00:25:29,748
Gosh, this is crazy.

482
00:25:29,748 --> 00:25:32,548
All right. Yes, yes.

483
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:35,192
I'll connect now. Okay.

484
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:40,258
Gosh, this guy. He's a top star.
Doesn't he work?

485
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:42,598
<i>Should I ask Joon Ki?</i>

486
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:44,928
<i>But I said I wouldn't talk to him.</i>

487
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:46,621
<i>What should I do then?</i>

488
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:47,769
<i>Ah.</i>

489
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:55,434
What? Do you have something to say?

490
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:59,415
What are you doing?

491
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,700
<i>Help me meet Seo Jin Woo.</i>

492
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,829
What is this?

493
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:10,881
I thought you weren't
going to talk to me.

494
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:13,676
You said I don't exist to you.

495
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,221
<i>I said I wouldn't talk to you.
I didn't say I wouldn't text you.</i>

496
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:20,500
<i>Will you help me meet him or not?</i>

497
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,540
You're seriously so stubborn.

498
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,290
Fine, I'll help you meet him.

499
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,465
But you have to accept
my relationship with Seo Jin.

500
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,166
What's with him?

501
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:53,587
<i>Forget it, you petty jerk!
P-E-T-T-Y.</i>

502
00:26:53,587 --> 00:26:56,385
Is he a psycho or what?

503
00:26:57,217 --> 00:26:59,929
Hey, what are you going to do now?

504
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:03,559
Philip's so upset that he won't ever work
with us again, so what will you do?

505
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,566
Sorry, he was wearing the sneakers
that Mal Geum gave me.

506
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:08,971
In his bare feet, at that.

507
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:11,471
- He even jumped.
- Shut up!

508
00:27:11,471 --> 00:27:13,891
You threw a fit
that I couldn't endure it.

509
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:15,922
You cursed right in his face?

510
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:18,521
What? His feet are worse
than fermented tofu?

511
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:20,913
They're worse than sewers?

512
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:23,624
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

513
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:27,055
We have to upload the new
products today. What do we do?

514
00:27:27,055 --> 00:27:29,531
Where will we find a model at this hour?

515
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,231
Then Doo Shik can do it.

516
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:32,602
- What?
- What?

517
00:27:32,602 --> 00:27:34,307
Doo Shik?

518
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:36,777
You want our shopping mall
to fall into ruin?

519
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:38,355
- No way.
- Why not?

520
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:40,577
I think Doo Shik is handsome.

521
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,634
Huh?

522
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:45,627
Yoon Ah, you really have
a bad eye for things.

523
00:27:46,635 --> 00:27:48,987
This is really not right.

524
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:51,924
But you said you have to upload by today.

525
00:27:51,924 --> 00:27:54,511
I'm going crazy here.

526
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:01,576
The smell won't go away no matter what.

527
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:04,019
Do I have to pour this stuff everywhere?

528
00:28:07,044 --> 00:28:09,182
- Su Ah.
- Huh?

529
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:20,605
Hey. What do you think?

530
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:22,612
I tried my best.

531
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:28,476
Should we start, then?
Where should I stand?

532
00:28:29,284 --> 00:28:30,602
Over there, please.

533
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:33,702
Huh? Why are you suddenly
speaking formally to me?

534
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:34,722
Pardon?

535
00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:38,386
Never mind. Just go stand there.

536
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,747
Should I just stand like this?

537
00:28:47,747 --> 00:28:50,260
Yes, I'm starting.

538
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:02,777
- Director, I'm here.
- Okay.

539
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,325
Oh, what's Seo Jin Woo doing here?

540
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:10,403
He decided to do our film.

541
00:29:10,403 --> 00:29:12,596
What? Really?

542
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:14,786
Thank you. Thank you so much.

543
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,153
You should thank Joon Ki.

544
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:21,769
He followed me around all day
asking me to read this script, so I did.

545
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:22,858
Joon Ki?

546
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:25,925
He must care about you a lot.

547
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:29,161
He even sold me the game character
he's always refused to sell

548
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,371
and asked this favor.

549
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:33,438
Thanks to you,
I became president of the guild.

550
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,853
President of the guild.

551
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:51,057
You're here?

552
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:08,557
<i>I heard you asked Seo Jin Woo
for the favor.</i>

553
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,913
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

554
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:12,728
<i>I'm still not going to
accept you dating Seo Jin.</i>

555
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,877
I didn't do it because of that, man.

556
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:22,414
You finally started working again
and I wanted to help you out.

557
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:23,894
Don't worry about it.

558
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:31,559
Ah, this is annoying.
Joon Ki, let's talk.

559
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,402
Why? I thought you weren't going
to talk to me anymore.

560
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:36,292
Don't argue with me.

561
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,460
Joon Ki.

562
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:41,076
Do you really have to date Seo Jin?

563
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,698
Dong Gu, I'm sorry.

564
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:52,392
Even if you say you'll never see me...

565
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:55,592
I still can't give Seo Jin up.

566
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:57,048
Do you really have to do that?

567
00:30:57,048 --> 00:31:00,703
I really like Seo Jin. I'm sincere.

568
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,559
Yet, you dislike me that much?

569
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:07,749
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

570
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:13,512
Honestly, one of my best friends
and my only sister are dating.

571
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:14,625
Why would I hate it?

572
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:18,416
But what if you two end up breaking up?

573
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,387
What will you do then?

574
00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:24,545
Then I can't see you again, Joon Ki.

575
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:26,125
You know that.

576
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,373
- Is that why?
- Of course.

577
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:31,222
We don't know the future.
Aren't you worried, Joon Ki?

578
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,011
Don't worry about it.

579
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:35,502
I'll never break up with Seo Jin, okay?

580
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:38,159
I'll never make Seo Jin cry.

581
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,207
If anyone cries, it'll be me.

582
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:43,538
So, trust me, kid.

583
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:47,257
- What did you just say?
- Huh?

584
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:49,657
What? What is it?

585
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,088
You called your brother-in-law a kid?

586
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:54,041
I'm your elder, don't you know?

587
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,372
Elder? What are you talking about?

588
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:00,355
What?

589
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:06,019
Then... are you saying
you're okay with us?

590
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:08,722
I was about to.

591
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:11,760
You don't know your position,
so forget about it.

592
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,755
Brother-in-law!

593
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:17,242
Thank you, Brother-in-law.
Thank you so much, Brother-in-law.

594
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:18,773
What...

595
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:22,753
No need to be gross about it.
Come on, now.

596
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:26,414
- You're my style.
- Stop it.

597
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:29,712
Seo Jin, Seo Jin, wake up. Seo Jin!

598
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:32,577
What?

599
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:37,083
Hey, what kind of a woman
grows a beard so fast?

600
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,483
Did it grow that much?

601
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:41,443
Good. Wait, I'm going to show Dong Gu.

602
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:42,880
Seo Jin.

603
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,513
You don't have to do it anymore.

604
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:47,503
- Dong Gu said okay to us.
- What?

605
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:50,669
Really? He did? For real?

606
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:55,683
What a relief. Why is love so hard?

607
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,843
Then, I can go on dates with you.

608
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,733
Can I tell everyone
that you're my boyfriend?

609
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:04,840
Yes, you can shout it on the news.

610
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,417
I'm so happy.

611
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,979
Oh, that's prickly. It hurts.

612
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:10,125
Sorry, sorry.

613
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,556
I'd better go shave for now.

614
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:13,740
Seo Jin.

615
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,320
Yes, what?

616
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,223
There's something that
I've always wanted to do for you.

617
00:33:20,223 --> 00:33:21,722
What is it?

618
00:33:47,378 --> 00:33:49,165
I love you.

619
00:33:54,773 --> 00:33:59,317
What are those two doing
holed up in the room for so long?

620
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,487
Leave them alone.
They like each other so much.

621
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:04,298
You should've given them
permission earlier.

622
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:05,909
I guess so.

623
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:08,590
At first, I was very worried.

624
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,083
When I saw Joon Ki's eyes,
I felt like I could trust him.

625
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:17,655
"At the very least,
Joon Ki won't make my sister cry."

626
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,362
Something like that.

627
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:20,876
You're so bad at it.

628
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:23,346
I said I was sorry. I'm sorry.

629
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:26,458
Is sorry enough? I said I would do it.
Why did you insist on shaving me?

630
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:29,405
- What if I get a scar?
- I didn't do it on purpose.

631
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:31,545
What kind of a woman has such stiff hair?

632
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:33,166
It's like whale sinew.

633
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:36,065
Whale sinew?
Are you done talking, you punk?

634
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:38,686
"Punk"? To your elder?

635
00:34:38,686 --> 00:34:40,795
You really have no manners.

636
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:42,610
Yeah, I have no manners.

637
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,469
Do you regret dating
a girl with no manners?

638
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,809
Yes, I do regret it.
What are you going to do?

639
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:49,289
Yeah? Then, let's break up.
We can break up.

640
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,059
Fine, let's break up.

641
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:54,007
Dong Gu, this won't do.
We're breaking up.

642
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:57,139
Ah, really?

643
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:06,710
Dong Gu... calm down. It was a joke.

644
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,925
A joke?

645
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:10,614
Yes, it was just a love fight.

646
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:11,657
Yes.

647
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:14,547
Love fight? What a load of crap.

648
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,768
Get over here, both of you.
Get over here.

649
00:35:16,768 --> 00:35:18,403
Get over here!

650
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:28,722
Yes, Manager. Yes.

651
00:35:29,672 --> 00:35:31,597
Ah, yes.

652
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,766
I understand.

653
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:37,731
Yes, I will get the exclusive scoop. Yes.

654
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,731
This is crazy.

655
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:43,237
What? What's going on?

656
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:44,847
It's just work.

657
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:47,322
My manager says to get the scoop
on a story or resign.

658
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:49,253
This is driving me nuts.

659
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:53,668
Joon Ki, have you heard any stories
at the broadcast station?

660
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,554
Any dating rumors?

661
00:35:55,909 --> 00:36:01,090
It isn't a dating rumor,
but I did hear something.

662
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,791
What is it?

663
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:09,894
- You know the top star, Han Min Joo?
- Yes.

664
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:14,451
I heard Han Min Joo had a secret baby
with Songjin Group's CEO, Park Jin Chul.

665
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:17,567
What? So, they're having an affair?

666
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:20,784
That old grandfather and Han Min Joo?

667
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:22,110
Yes, that's right.

668
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,179
I heard it from
a 100 percent reliable source.

669
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:25,869
Who did you hear it from?

670
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:27,639
You know my station, right?

671
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:30,088
They have a separate entryway for VIPs.

672
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:34,028
Only top stars like Gong Yoo, Won Bin,
and other VIPs can go through there.

673
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:36,802
So, you heard it
from one of the high-ranking staff.

674
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:39,688
No, the security guard of that area.
He's my coffee buddy.

675
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:42,284
- How's that?
- Security guard?

676
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,958
Are you kidding me right now?

677
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:45,563
You don't know what you're saying.

678
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:48,822
The good informants
are usually those people.

679
00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:53,291
Really? Then where can I meet him?

680
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,994
Oh, you two are together.

681
00:36:57,994 --> 00:37:00,030
Oh, what are you doing here, Dong Gu?

682
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,360
I'm here to see Hyun Joon.

683
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,449
To see me?

684
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:05,994
You know those big loaves
you made me before?

685
00:37:05,994 --> 00:37:09,141
Please make me about 30 more,
a little larger.

686
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:11,617
- I can do that.
- Are you two going somewhere?

687
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:14,773
Yes, something good happened
for Yoon Ah today.

688
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:17,166
- We're going for a drink.
- A drink?

689
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:20,431
I got a delivery order for my muffins.

690
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:22,681
Ah, really?

691
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:25,193
I should congratulate you too.

692
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:28,081
They say if you share you joy,
it doubles.

693
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,097
Isn't that right?

694
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:33,818
I don't know about today.
I have to talk to Yoon Ah.

695
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,648
You can do it in front of me.

696
00:37:35,648 --> 00:37:39,237
What? Is it something I can't hear?

697
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:44,547
<i>[A Not So Flashy Confession 2]</i>

698
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:46,485
Congratulations, Yoon Ah.

699
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:49,597
Yes. Thank you.

700
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:52,599
Isn't this place very expensive?

701
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,978
It's a good day.
You should have good food.

702
00:37:54,978 --> 00:37:57,079
Don't worry about it and eat up.

703
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,338
Okay. Thank you.

704
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,141
I'll step out and take this call.

705
00:38:05,891 --> 00:38:07,916
Here. Have a drink, Dong Gu.

706
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,657
No, it's all right.

707
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,454
I'll order my own.

708
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:14,454
That wine is not to my liking.

709
00:38:14,454 --> 00:38:18,266
And more than anything,
I don't want wine paid for by you.

710
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:20,005
Yes, do as you wish.

711
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:23,650
Waitress! Menu, please.

712
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,925
Let me see here.

713
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:28,903
Do they have they wine that I like?

714
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:30,197
<i>What is this?</i>

715
00:38:30,197 --> 00:38:33,664
<i>The cheapest is 12,000 won per glass?</i>

716
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:35,224
<i>Just for one? </i>

717
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,978
- Would you like to order?
- What?

718
00:38:46,978 --> 00:38:51,721
- Ah... I'll have a glass of this.
- Sure.

719
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:56,898
However, can you pour
about 200 won's worth less?

720
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:57,949
Excuse me?

721
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:00,286
I just have a lot of work to do tonight.

722
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:03,793
I'm worried I might have trouble working
if I have the whole glass.

723
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:07,320
Take out about 200 won's worth.

724
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,655
Yum, yum.

725
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:21,208
- So good.
- Oh yeah.

726
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:24,456
You said you had something
to say to me, Hyun Joon.

727
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:25,856
Yes.

728
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:29,210
I'll do it next time.

729
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,474
It's getting late today.
Shall we get going?

730
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:32,827
Yes.

731
00:39:43,353 --> 00:39:46,173
You'll get punished
if you leave food behind.

732
00:39:46,173 --> 00:39:49,148
You eat it all after you die.
Don't you know?

733
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:50,568
How much is it?

734
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:53,713
I already paid for everything.
We can just leave.

735
00:39:53,713 --> 00:39:55,922
Hyun Joon, I really enjoyed the meal.

736
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:59,235
Wait, let's talk.

737
00:39:59,235 --> 00:40:01,463
I'll be waiting outside, then.

738
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:02,748
Okay.

739
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:05,907
Look, I told you.

740
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:08,670
I don't want to be indebted to you.

741
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,907
This is for my wine. 11,800 won.

742
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,648
Hold on a little bit.

743
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:23,079
Thank you for the meal today, Hyun Joon.

744
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,259
Get home safely.

745
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:27,204
Yes. See you in class, Yoon Ah.

746
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:29,179
Dong Gu, goodbye.

747
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,710
Wait.

748
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,532
Don't leave yet. Wait here.

749
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:33,592
Why?

750
00:40:33,592 --> 00:40:36,452
Just stay and wait.

751
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:38,092
Yoon Ah, let's go.

752
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:39,454
Okay.

753
00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:49,021
- Here.
- What is this?

754
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:51,568
It's the taxi fare for me
and Yoon Ah. What else?

755
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:55,195
I calculated mine and Yoon Ah's,
so you can check.

756
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:56,614
Don't say otherwise later.

757
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,505
Must you really do this?

758
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:03,684
I told you that I don't want to be
indebted to you whatsoever.

759
00:41:03,684 --> 00:41:08,431
Hey, now. It went up 100 won
while we were talking.

760
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:11,233
Here, 100 won.

761
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:13,313
Give me back 33 won.

762
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:16,547
- What?
- Never mind. Just keep it.

763
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:20,838
Also, you keep saying to
my guest house employee...

764
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:23,739
"Let's go drink and let's go eat."

765
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:26,260
Can I ask you to keep it to a minimum?

766
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,983
It gets in the way of my business.

767
00:41:27,983 --> 00:41:30,614
I think you were the one
who got in the way today.

768
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:32,447
What did you say?

769
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:35,304
- What does that mean?
- It's nothing.

770
00:41:35,304 --> 00:41:36,971
I'll be going now.

771
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:45,246
What is he talking about?

772
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:48,487
I just don't like that guy.

773
00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:00,561
Excuse me. Mister Kim Yong Shik.

774
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,101
- That's you?
- Yes.

775
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:04,121
Who are you?

776
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,471
I...

777
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:08,820
am a reporter for Joyoung Daily,
Kang Seo Jin.

778
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,590
Why did you need to see me?

779
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:15,601
I heard that Han Min Joo had
Songjin Group CEO Park Jin Chul's baby.

780
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,648
Is that true?

781
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:18,989
Who said that?

782
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,867
I never said that.

783
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:24,228
I heard everything from
Lee Joon Ki of JBC's "Newsroom."

784
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:27,661
Gosh, I told him never
to tell anyone else.

785
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:28,777
This could be a problem.

786
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:31,909
I'll keep your identity anonymous,
so please tell me.

787
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:34,577
Did you see it yourself?

788
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:37,298
Honestly, I didn't see for myself.

789
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:39,978
I heard it from a trustworthy source.

790
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:42,498
Who is that?

791
00:42:42,498 --> 00:42:45,079
You know Elegance Shop in Cheongdam-dong?

792
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:47,188
Han Min Joo goes there.

793
00:42:47,188 --> 00:42:50,528
The owner there is named Won Kyung Hee.

794
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:53,213
- Is that who you heard it from?
- No.

795
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:57,666
There's a designer named Lee Jung Min
whom Won Kyung Hee likes most.

796
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:01,117
- Then it was Designer Lee Jung Min?
- No.

797
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:03,608
Designer Lee Jung Min has an assistant.

798
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:06,346
Her name is Kim In Na
and she washes hair.

799
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:10,467
I told my brother-in-law
not to tell anyone.

800
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:14,847
I'll keep your identity anonymous,
so don't worry and tell me. Okay?

801
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:17,936
Then you can't ever write that
it was me who told you.

802
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:19,992
Don't worry about that.

803
00:43:21,534 --> 00:43:22,846
Did you see for yourself?

804
00:43:22,846 --> 00:43:24,913
I didn't see for myself.

805
00:43:24,913 --> 00:43:27,903
I heard it from someone
who is 100 percent trustworthy.

806
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:29,335
Ah, yes.

807
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:32,967
You know Han Min Joo's agency,
YS Entertainment?

808
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,514
- You heard from someone at YS?
- No.

809
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:41,443
There's a cook in the YS cafeteria
named Lee Choon Bok.

810
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:44,137
- Then you heard from Lee Choon Bok?
- No.

811
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:47,927
He likes spicy seafood noodle stew
and orders it daily.

812
00:43:47,927 --> 00:43:51,221
There's a restaurant
and they have killer stew there.

813
00:43:51,221 --> 00:43:54,148
Excuse me. Let's stay on topic.

814
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:58,280
Anyway, they have a deliveryman
named Um Ji Yong.

815
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,259
So, they call him Um G-Dragon.

816
00:44:02,259 --> 00:44:04,197
I heard it from him.

817
00:44:04,197 --> 00:44:06,269
Where is this restaurant?

818
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,954
I'm glad that
the muffins are selling well.

819
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,996
I think it's somewhere around here.

820
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:21,400
Where is it?

821
00:44:34,335 --> 00:44:35,764
<i>[Um G-Dragon]</i>

822
00:44:35,764 --> 00:44:40,702
Gosh, I told her not to tell anyone.

823
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:43,311
She is such a bigmouth.

824
00:44:43,311 --> 00:44:46,882
I'll keep your identity anonymous,
so don't worry and tell me.

825
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:48,266
Did you see for yourself?

826
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,835
- I didn't see for myself.
- Okay.

827
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:54,306
- I heard it from someone trustworthy.
- What?

828
00:44:54,306 --> 00:44:56,936
You know the famous designer, Andy Kim?

829
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:58,646
Yes, I do.

830
00:44:58,646 --> 00:45:02,275
- Did you hear it from Andy Kim?
- No.

831
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:07,708
There's a model named Han Hye Jin
who regularly does Andy Kim shows.

832
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,277
- Ah, so you heard from Han Hye Jin?
- No.

833
00:45:11,277 --> 00:45:14,514
Hear the story until the end.

834
00:45:14,514 --> 00:45:15,550
Sorry.

835
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:20,940
Han Hye Jin has been giving classes
at a model academy.

836
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,880
I heard it from a student
who was auditing that class.

837
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,731
She is a member of the G-Dragon fan club.

838
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,023
I'm the president.

839
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:33,362
Would she dare to lie
to the fan club president?

840
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:35,695
Where can I meet her?

841
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:41,112
Recently, she was about to go abroad,
but got conned by her boyfriend.

842
00:45:41,112 --> 00:45:44,567
I heard she's living at
her ex-boyfriend's place.

843
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:45,684
What?

844
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:51,715
By any chance,
could you tell me her name?

845
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,228
What? It was you?

846
00:45:54,228 --> 00:45:56,876
You said Han Min Joo had a baby
with Songjin Group's CEO?

847
00:45:56,876 --> 00:45:59,947
Huh? I never said that.

848
00:45:59,947 --> 00:46:03,471
- Who said that?
- A deliveryman for spicy seafood stew.

849
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:06,818
I heard everything from Um Ji Yong,
whose nickname is Um G-Dragon.

850
00:46:06,818 --> 00:46:10,284
Gosh, the president is too much.

851
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:14,931
We spent so many fan meetings together
and he betrays his comrade.

852
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:17,818
Don't be like that and tell me the truth.

853
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:22,268
Did you see for yourself that Han Min Joo
had Songjin Group CEO's baby?

854
00:46:22,268 --> 00:46:23,938
I didn't see it myself.

855
00:46:23,938 --> 00:46:27,186
But I heard it myself from a person
who is 100 percent trustworthy.

856
00:46:27,186 --> 00:46:29,237
You only heard it too?

857
00:46:29,237 --> 00:46:31,447
No one saw anything and just heard it.

858
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:32,697
Are you sure about it?

859
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:35,097
I am sure about it.

860
00:46:35,097 --> 00:46:39,228
I heard about it from the nurse at the
hospital where Han Min Joo had the baby.

861
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:42,146
She said she held the baby herself.

862
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:45,706
Really? She held the baby?

863
00:46:45,706 --> 00:46:47,637
- Yes.
- Oh, big news.

864
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:51,266
This is a big scoop.
Thank you, Su Ah!

865
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,836
My leg. Oh, my leg!

866
00:46:53,836 --> 00:46:56,630
You should be careful driving.
What is this?

867
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,704
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

868
00:46:58,704 --> 00:47:01,382
Doctor, is he very injured?

869
00:47:01,382 --> 00:47:03,103
His leg is severely broken.

870
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:05,036
- What?
- It's a compound fracture.

871
00:47:05,036 --> 00:47:07,878
He'll need surgery
and will have many symptoms after.

872
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:10,679
What? I'm going insane here.

873
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:12,398
Young lady, what will you do?

874
00:47:12,398 --> 00:47:15,856
What are you going to do?
I have to go to work.

875
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:18,677
I'm sorry. I'll take
responsibility somehow.

876
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:20,726
I am so sorry.

877
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:30,822
Wow, it's going in. It's going in!

878
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:35,697
It's perfect. It went in!

879
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:39,219
Wow, this works!

880
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:43,646
You're home, Yoon Ah?

881
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:49,715
Why does your face look that way?
Is something wrong?

882
00:47:49,715 --> 00:47:51,277
What?

883
00:47:51,277 --> 00:47:53,547
Ah... no.

884
00:47:53,547 --> 00:47:56,869
I'm tired.
I'm going to go rest in my room.

885
00:47:57,971 --> 00:47:59,706
What's wrong with her?

886
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:16,032
Nurse Yoon Ji Woo?

887
00:48:16,032 --> 00:48:17,467
Yes. Who are you?

888
00:48:17,467 --> 00:48:21,554
I'm Reporter Kang Seo Jin
from Joyoung Daily who called earlier.

889
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:22,739
You know Min Su Ah, right?

890
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:27,239
Ah, that girl I met a few days ago
shopping for clothes in Dongdaemun?

891
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,291
She was such a fun girl.

892
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:32,300
We became friendly over pork bone stew
and a bottle of soju.

893
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,097
Why?

894
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:37,168
By any chance, did you tell Min Su Ah...

895
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:41,157
that you saw Han Min Joo's baby?

896
00:48:41,157 --> 00:48:43,507
- Is that true?
- What?

897
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,465
Ah... I did say that.

898
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,378
Really? This is big news.

899
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:52,737
I saw Han Min Joo's baby...

900
00:48:52,737 --> 00:48:55,126
in a dream I had.

901
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:56,528
- A dream?
- Yes.

902
00:48:56,528 --> 00:48:59,657
There's a woman in our hospital
who looks like Han Min Joo.

903
00:48:59,657 --> 00:49:03,467
She is so pretty,
but her husband is so old.

904
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:06,137
He looks like he's in his 60s.

905
00:49:06,137 --> 00:49:09,829
Then I had a dream about that.

906
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:11,706
Oh my.

907
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:15,507
Alcohol.

908
00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:18,108
So, that was about a dream.

909
00:49:18,108 --> 00:49:21,530
I must have misheard
because I was a bit drunk that day.

910
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,112
Sorry.

911
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:25,702
Sorry? Is sorry enough?

912
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:28,103
Do you know what I went through
because of you today?

913
00:49:28,103 --> 00:49:30,182
People can get drunk and make mistakes.

914
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:31,572
Is this a mistake?

915
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:36,302
There are rumors that Han Min Joo had
an affair and had a baby because of you.

916
00:49:36,302 --> 00:49:38,322
The rumor has spread
all over the country.

917
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:40,592
- Really?
- Yes.

918
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:43,222
So I was someone
with that much influence.

919
00:49:43,222 --> 00:49:44,460
I didn't know.

920
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,922
So, are you proud? Are you proud?

921
00:49:47,922 --> 00:49:49,327
No.

922
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:51,856
This is how rumors are spread.

923
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:57,686
I never imagined that someone who
spreads rumors like that was near me.

924
00:49:57,686 --> 00:50:00,376
How am I supposed to
face my manager tomorrow?

925
00:50:00,376 --> 00:50:04,271
You take responsibility, Su Ah!
What are you going to do?

926
00:50:06,197 --> 00:50:09,936
Then, should I let you in
on something really big?

927
00:50:09,936 --> 00:50:13,400
This is 100 percent factual.

928
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:16,135
Really big?

929
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:18,128
What is it?

930
00:50:20,027 --> 00:50:21,710
Give me your ear.

931
00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:32,815
What? Kang Dong Won is an alien?

932
00:50:32,815 --> 00:50:34,661
I'm telling you that he is.

933
00:50:34,661 --> 00:50:37,523
Kang Dong Won's looks
are not of this world.

934
00:50:37,523 --> 00:50:40,059
If he makes his ears stand
to send a telepathic message

935
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:41,532
they come from space.

936
00:50:41,532 --> 00:50:42,784
Shut up!

937
00:50:42,784 --> 00:50:46,123
I'm going crazy because of you.

938
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:47,902
Hey, I have something else, then.

939
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:52,048
Park Bo Gum has wings on his back.
They say he's an angel!

940
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,782
Ah... water.

941
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:03,300
This is Yoon Ah's phone.
Did she leave it here?

942
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:07,876
Yes, this is Han Yoon Ah's phone.

943
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:10,856
Yes, she left her phone behind.

944
00:51:10,856 --> 00:51:12,590
Who is this?

945
00:51:14,326 --> 00:51:17,568
What? What did you say?

946
00:51:21,755 --> 00:51:23,418
30 million won?

947
00:51:23,418 --> 00:51:26,509
I was trying to let her off
because of her situation.

948
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:29,112
I didn't go to the police
and decided to settle.

949
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:33,068
I can't work because I'm injured
and I'm losing out on a lot.

950
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:35,378
Still, 30 million won is a bit...

951
00:51:35,378 --> 00:51:37,402
How can she get such
a large amount so suddenly?

952
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:39,248
Then go to the police!

953
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:41,231
- I can sue her.
- No.

954
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,643
We'll get it.

955
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,478
I'll get it somehow.

956
00:51:47,478 --> 00:51:49,387
Please wait a little bit.

957
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:55,775
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah.

958
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,518
Yoon Ah, let's talk.

959
00:51:59,518 --> 00:52:01,628
Yes, Dong Gu. What is it?

960
00:52:01,628 --> 00:52:04,182
I heard you got in an accident.

961
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:07,188
You should have told me about it.

962
00:52:07,188 --> 00:52:10,349
Sorry, I didn't want you to worry.

963
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:13,106
What is it? What? What's wrong?

964
00:52:19,259 --> 00:52:22,409
What? 30 million won?

965
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:24,168
I'm sorry.

966
00:52:24,168 --> 00:52:26,769
I just couldn't bring myself to say it.

967
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,072
It's fine. We'll talk about that later.

968
00:52:29,072 --> 00:52:32,309
Let's all try to get some money.
I'll look into it too.

969
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:33,929
- Okay.
- I'll do that too.

970
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:35,480
Okay.

971
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,485
We can do it.

972
00:52:37,485 --> 00:52:39,465
Don't worry too much, Yoon Ah.

973
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:42,652
We'll resolve this somehow, okay?

974
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,132
Oh, Sun Dong. It's been a long time.

975
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:56,867
Do you think I could borrow some money?

976
00:52:56,867 --> 00:52:59,137
Marrying? You're getting married?

977
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:01,090
Hey, Hae Won. It's Dong Gu.

978
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,128
Dong Woo, how have you been?

979
00:53:03,128 --> 00:53:05,336
I wondered if I could borrow money.

980
00:53:05,336 --> 00:53:07,858
Director, could you help out?

981
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:11,632
Sorry, Dong Gu.
I don't have the money either.

982
00:53:29,077 --> 00:53:30,577
Yeah, Joon Ki.

983
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:36,585
Ah, the bank can't give us loans
because of the debt we already have.

984
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:39,585
Did you get anything?

985
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:42,963
I see.

986
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:46,123
Okay.

987
00:54:08,864 --> 00:54:11,414
Dong Gu, what brings you by?

988
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,422
Well, the thing is...

989
00:54:14,923 --> 00:54:16,864
I have a favor to ask.

990
00:54:16,864 --> 00:54:18,677
A favor?

991
00:54:18,677 --> 00:54:20,233
You have a favor to ask me?

992
00:54:20,233 --> 00:54:21,856
Hyun Joon.

993
00:54:25,385 --> 00:54:27,362
Lend me some money.

994
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:28,853
30 million won.

995
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:30,798
30 million won?

996
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:33,452
What's going on?

997
00:54:35,173 --> 00:54:39,630
I need to know what it's for
to know if I'll lend it to you or not.

998
00:54:41,693 --> 00:54:45,396
If you won't tell me,
then I can't lend it to you.

999
00:54:47,394 --> 00:54:49,925
Yoon Ah got in an accident.

1000
00:54:50,735 --> 00:54:52,864
Yoon Ah? Why?

1001
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:54,545
Is something wrong with Yoon Ah?

1002
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:57,978
Yoon Ah got in a car accident and
she needs money for a settlement.

1003
00:54:57,978 --> 00:54:59,815
We tried our best to get it.

1004
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:02,778
Let's go. I'll get it right away.

1005
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,338
What are you doing? Hurry up.

1006
00:55:14,735 --> 00:55:16,539
I'm sorry.

1007
00:55:17,045 --> 00:55:21,114
But, Mister...
I don't have money right now.

1008
00:55:21,114 --> 00:55:23,961
Could I repay you little by little?

1009
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:25,797
I will get it somehow.

1010
00:55:25,797 --> 00:55:28,425
Forget it. Just call the police.

1011
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:31,590
I have nothing to say to you.
Just call the police.

1012
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,532
- Call the police!
- Mister.

1013
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,416
What? They really came?

1014
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,755
Police in our country
have improved a lot.

1015
00:55:39,755 --> 00:55:42,077
- Are you Seo Tae Woo?
- Yes, that's me.

1016
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:45,440
You are under arrest for extortion
and insurance fraud.

1017
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,141
- What?
- Arrest him.

1018
00:55:47,141 --> 00:55:50,273
What is this? I'm a patient!

1019
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:58,552
You were lucky. You nearly were a victim.

1020
00:55:58,552 --> 00:56:01,760
He's the very worst of the criminals
pretending to victims.

1021
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,530
The doctor lied along with him,
so many people were victimized.

1022
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:08,824
Thank you.

1023
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:12,585
Then, I don't have to pay a settlement?

1024
00:56:12,585 --> 00:56:14,579
No. Don't worry about it.

1025
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,516
Hey, take him away.

1026
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,349
Come on.

1027
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,197
Thank you so much.

1028
00:56:25,137 --> 00:56:27,576
- Yoon Ah.
- Oh!

1029
00:56:27,576 --> 00:56:29,228
Dong Gu, Hyun Joon.

1030
00:56:29,228 --> 00:56:31,456
I heard you were in an accident.
What happened?

1031
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:33,675
Oh, that...

1032
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:35,192
It got resolved.

1033
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:37,425
I don't have to pay a settlement anymore.

1034
00:56:37,425 --> 00:56:40,235
He purposely gets injured
and extorts money.

1035
00:56:40,235 --> 00:56:43,751
Gosh, I was so anxious. That jerk.

1036
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:47,543
Is that right? What a relief.
I was so worried.

1037
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:48,773
Sorry.

1038
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:51,893
You'll have to come to
the police station with me.

1039
00:56:51,893 --> 00:56:54,422
Me? Why... why?

1040
00:56:54,422 --> 00:56:57,014
We need you as a witness.

1041
00:56:57,592 --> 00:57:00,005
Yoon Ah, don't worry too much.

1042
00:57:00,005 --> 00:57:03,063
I'll ask a lawyer I know to come along.

1043
00:57:03,063 --> 00:57:04,791
You don't need to be scared.

1044
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:08,496
Thank you, Hyun Joon. Thank you so much.

1045
00:57:15,594 --> 00:57:17,972
What happened? Is everything okay?

1046
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:23,206
Yes, Hyun Joon introduced me to a lawyer
and we figured it all out.

1047
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,882
Sorry to make all of you worry.

1048
00:57:25,882 --> 00:57:29,735
No, I'm relieved it all worked out.

1049
00:57:29,735 --> 00:57:34,219
I'm a little tired,
so I'm going to go in and rest.

1050
00:57:53,824 --> 00:57:55,579
What are you doing?

1051
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:56,945
Nothing really.

1052
00:57:56,945 --> 00:57:59,389
Yoon Ah's problem worked out,
so what's wrong?

1053
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:00,880
Did something happen?

1054
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,269
Nothing.

1055
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:04,346
I just feel so pathetic.

1056
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:06,226
Pathetic?

1057
00:58:06,226 --> 00:58:07,257
What do you mean?

1058
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:12,146
I ran around all day trying to get
that settlement money and I couldn't.

1059
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:16,818
Hyun Joon took one second to get it
after hearing about it.

1060
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:19,510
He knew a lawyer too.

1061
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,068
That's because Hyun Joon's older
and he's a famous patisseur.

1062
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:25,581
It's only natural.

1063
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:29,063
Right? He naturally would.

1064
00:58:30,603 --> 00:58:33,304
But, that natural thing...

1065
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:36,525
just didn't feel so natural.

1066
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:48,523
It's a relief that
the accident got resolved.

1067
00:58:48,523 --> 00:58:50,222
It's all thanks to you, Hyun Joon.

1068
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:51,242
Thank you.

1069
00:58:51,242 --> 00:58:54,800
Oh no. What did I do?

1070
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,469
But, what was it that
you wanted to say, Hyun Joon?

1071
00:58:57,469 --> 00:59:01,320
Ah... why don't we eat first?

1072
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,282
- Would you like more wine?
- Ah, sure.

1073
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:12,454
Oh no!

1074
00:59:12,454 --> 00:59:13,903
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

1075
00:59:13,903 --> 00:59:16,400
Yes, I'm okay.

1076
00:59:16,947 --> 00:59:19,427
Hyun Joon, I'll be in the restroom.

1077
00:59:19,427 --> 00:59:20,590
Okay.

1078
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,394
How was your meal?

1079
00:59:34,394 --> 00:59:37,445
Yes, it was so delicious.

1080
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:40,929
What was it you wanted to
say to me, Hyun Joon?

1081
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:45,175
Yoon Ah, honestly I--

1082
00:59:45,175 --> 00:59:46,650
Wait.

1083
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,173
Oh, where did it go?

1084
00:59:50,442 --> 00:59:52,494
What? Is something missing?

1085
00:59:52,494 --> 00:59:55,289
Yes, my hairpin is missing.

1086
00:59:55,289 --> 00:59:57,630
I know I had it earlier.

1087
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,704
Where did it go? What do I do?

1088
01:00:00,704 --> 01:00:03,547
What do I do? Where is it?

1089
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:06,155
Where did it go? Where?

1090
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:08,746
You can buy a new hairpin.

1091
01:00:08,746 --> 01:00:10,695
I'll buy you a pretty one.

1092
01:00:10,695 --> 01:00:14,396
No, Dong Gu bought it for me.

1093
01:00:14,396 --> 01:00:17,045
It's the first gift I received from him.

1094
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:24,141
Ah, maybe I lost it in the restroom.

1095
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:27,208
Hyun Joon, I'm going to go check there.

1096
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:41,929
Yoon Ah, don't look so down.

1097
01:00:42,436 --> 01:00:44,027
Sorry.

1098
01:00:44,027 --> 01:00:47,387
Because of me,
I'm bringing you down too.

1099
01:00:47,387 --> 01:00:49,713
No, it's okay.

1100
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:51,599
Oh.

1101
01:00:52,844 --> 01:00:54,284
Hold on.

1102
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:55,905
Why?

1103
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:03,199
This... Isn't this the hairpin you lost?

1104
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,304
Yes, this is it. This is the one!

1105
01:01:06,304 --> 01:01:08,931
Ah, what a relief.

1106
01:01:10,454 --> 01:01:13,280
You're finally smiling.
Are you that happy to find it?

1107
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,733
Yes, I really thought I lost it.

1108
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:18,802
I was so worried about it.

1109
01:01:20,057 --> 01:01:22,025
Shall we get going now?

1110
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:23,313
Yoon Ah.

1111
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,972
I have something to say.

1112
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:28,010
Right, you said you did.

1113
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,418
What is it? Tell me.

1114
01:01:30,418 --> 01:01:32,202
Remember what you said, Yoon Ah.

1115
01:01:32,202 --> 01:01:37,072
You didn't want to trust
someone again or get hurt.

1116
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:39,083
Ah... yes.

1117
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:42,516
But, just because
you fear getting hurt...

1118
01:01:42,516 --> 01:01:47,780
I wish you would not fear and hesitate
when it comes to love.

1119
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,431
What?

1120
01:01:49,431 --> 01:01:55,123
So, don't lose that person you like.

1121
01:01:55,123 --> 01:01:57,105
What do you mean by that?

1122
01:01:57,105 --> 01:01:59,545
I'm talking about Dong Gu.

1123
01:01:59,545 --> 01:02:00,998
Yoon Ah...

1124
01:02:02,295 --> 01:02:04,422
You like Dong Gu.

1125
01:02:05,704 --> 01:02:06,978
What?

1126
01:02:06,978 --> 01:02:09,483
But you're afraid of getting hurt again.

1127
01:02:09,483 --> 01:02:12,494
You're scared and afraid,
so you're pushing him away.

1128
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:13,914
Isn't that right?

1129
01:02:15,934 --> 01:02:20,759
If you keep pushing him away
and you lose someone you like...

1130
01:02:20,759 --> 01:02:23,668
won't that hurt you too?

1131
01:02:23,668 --> 01:02:25,965
Wouldn't that hurt more?

1132
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:33,514
Shall we say farewell now?

1133
01:02:33,514 --> 01:02:37,268
Yes... get home safely.

1134
01:02:43,414 --> 01:02:46,891
Ah... about Dong Gu.

1135
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:51,342
He doesn't like to be indebted to me,
even for a taxi fare of 100 won.

1136
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:55,351
But he came to me
when you had your accident.

1137
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:57,724
He asked me to help you.

1138
01:02:57,724 --> 01:03:00,342
He probably hated it to death.

1139
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:03,878
It must be because
he likes you that much, Yoon Ah.

1140
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:07,250
Maybe I'm reading too much into it.

1141
01:03:08,313 --> 01:03:11,644
I'll really get going now.

1142
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:43,137
I'll sell all these for you, okay?

1143
01:03:43,137 --> 01:03:44,340
I'll help you.

1144
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:47,141
Buy these muffins.
Buy the muffins. They're good.

1145
01:03:47,141 --> 01:03:50,146
Do you even know
how this woman is living?

1146
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:54,625
Move, would you? Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah!

1147
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,505
You're not hurt, are you?

1148
01:03:56,505 --> 01:03:58,585
Are you all right?

1149
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:01,266
<i>He left the city to look
for filming locations.</i>

1150
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:03,427
<i>You think he'd come to Seoul
to eat blood sausages?</i>

1151
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:06,715
Yoon Ah, I like you.
I really like you a lot.

1152
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:07,414
What are you doing here alone?

1153
01:05:08,003 --> 01:05:09,409
Just sitting here.

1154
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:12,275
Did you go somewhere?

1155
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,505
I met Hyun Joon.

1156
01:05:15,126 --> 01:05:17,936
Ah, I see.

1157
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:24,019
Song Hyun Joon seems like
a better person than I thought he was.

1158
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:26,719
He's successful
and has a good personality.

1159
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:29,246
He's pretty good looking too.

1160
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:32,233
He's good to you, Yoon Ah.

1161
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:34,190
Hold on.

1162
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:36,528
Why are you saying these things to me?

1163
01:05:36,528 --> 01:05:38,643
Well, just because.

1164
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:41,724
Dong Gu, do you know
that you are really stupid?

1165
01:05:41,724 --> 01:05:43,985
You have no sense for things at all.

1166
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:45,454
What did I do?

1167
01:05:45,454 --> 01:05:46,893
Never mind.

1168
01:05:47,686 --> 01:05:50,204
I'm tired. I'm going down to rest.

1169
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:56,155
She's getting mad at me for no reason.

1170
01:05:58,943 --> 01:06:00,581
What's this?

1171
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:03,601
<i>You like him that much?</i>

1172
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:04,918
<i>Yes.</i>

1173
01:06:04,918 --> 01:06:07,250
<i>Then say, "I like you."</i>

1174
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:10,280
<i>Dong Gu, I like you.</i>

1175
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,387
<i>Be cute.</i>

1176
01:06:11,387 --> 01:06:12,918
<i>I like you.</i>

1177
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,070
<i>Be lovely.</i>

1178
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,550
<i>I like you.</i>

1179
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,650
<i>Be adorable.</i>

1180
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,679
<i>I really like you.</i>

1181
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:19,869
<i>Be strong.</i>

1182
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:22,184
<i>I really like you.</i>

1183
01:06:32,077 --> 01:06:34,175
What is this?

1184
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:47,717
I like you.

1185
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:50,018
I really like you, Dong Gu.

1186
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:58,210
Do you... want to date me?

1187
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:01,521
Yoon Ah.
