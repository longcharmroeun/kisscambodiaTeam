3
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,649
Su Ah.

4
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:23,644
Dong Gu.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,603
You...

6
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,635
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:30,114
Is something wrong?

8
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:36,521
What am I supposed to do, Dong Gu?

9
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:55,308
What are we going to do now?

10
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:57,988
If we can't pay President Kim back,
we'll get kicked out right away.

11
00:00:57,988 --> 00:00:59,448
I know.

12
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:02,207
We have nowhere else to go.
I'm going insane here.

13
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:04,507
This is all your fault, seriously.

14
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:06,308
What are you going to do now, huh?

15
00:01:06,308 --> 00:01:08,608
It's not like I knew this would happen.

16
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,748
Gosh, how am I supposed to get
that kind of money in one month?

17
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:13,885
I'm going nuts.

18
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:16,686
Joon Ki, it's not the time
for you to worry about money.

19
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:17,709
What do you mean?

20
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:19,266
Don't you know Dong Gu's coming soon?

21
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:23,135
A fake wedding, fake honeymoon,
and you put him into debt.

22
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,165
You don't expect to be safe, do you?

23
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,780
I pray for you to rest in peace.

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,328
I pray for you.

25
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:33,409
Doo Shik, give me Sol.

26
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:34,477
Why do you need Sol?

27
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:36,983
I need to be holding Sol to stop
Dong Gu from hitting me.

28
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:38,224
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:39,361
I'm home.

30
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:45,385
D... Dong Gu. Please stay calm.

31
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:47,302
Listen to what I have to say.

32
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:50,299
Don't say a word, not a single word.

33
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:55,840
What are you doing? Come on in.

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,891
What? Is someone here?

35
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:01,620
Huh?

36
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:03,995
Su Ah.

37
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:13,795
<i>[The Time When We Loved That Girl]</i>

38
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,846
Don't think about anything today
and just get some rest, okay?

39
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:31,152
Dong Gu, I don't think this is
the right thing to do.

40
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:35,051
I should have a conscience.
How can I burden you?

41
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:36,843
I'll just leave.

42
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:38,375
Hey, Min Su Ah.

43
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,042
You said you have nowhere to go.
Where are you going this late?

44
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:45,009
Go in the morning if you're going.
Don't make me worry.

45
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,461
Get some rest.

46
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:01,984
What?

47
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:04,713
The guy Su Ah was dating is a con artist?

48
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:08,843
He took her apartment deposit and
the money for her to study abroad?

49
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:10,112
Yes.

50
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:13,902
It seems that there are many others
besides Su Ah who got scammed.

51
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,582
She got targeted by a real professional.

52
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:18,282
I feel so sorry for Su Ah.

53
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,471
Why would you?

54
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:22,062
She got punished for
casting my brother aside and leaving.

55
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,813
Hey, why would you say that?

56
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:27,122
What? She ended up that way
because she left you for a rich guy.

57
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:29,103
How could she dare to follow you here?

58
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,313
She has no conscience.

59
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:31,786
She has nowhere to go.

60
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:33,063
She has her parents' home.

61
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,811
Su Ah's father is sick.

62
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:36,342
He'll pass out if he hears about this.

63
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,033
She was shaking and crying in the park.

64
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,423
Don't make her feel unwelcome
and be good to her.

65
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:43,015
Gosh, you feel
so sorry for her, don't you?

66
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,584
Why? Do you still have feelings for her
and want to make things work again?

67
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:49,024
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:50,771
It's not like that, you...

69
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,551
No need to get mad if it's not true.

70
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:55,561
Dong Gu, I'm sorry to ask.

71
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:58,694
I can't help but keep looking at
those oranges from Jeju Island.

72
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:01,465
You punk! You actually want to eat that?

73
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:04,467
What are you going to do about the money?
What are you going to do?

74
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,230
You take care of it,
no matter what.

75
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,500
Otherwise, I'll kick you right out.

76
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,519
I will. I will.

77
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:11,618
What's with your voice?

78
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,548
Do you know what I did for these oranges?

79
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,961
Just one, just one.

80
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:18,170
<i>Dong Gu, did you sleep well?</i>

81
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,670
No.

82
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:25,401
I couldn't sleep well at all
because of these red stickers.

83
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:27,432
Oh, I see.

84
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,487
Wait a little bit.
I'll prepare breakfast soon.

85
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:32,675
No, it's okay.
I'll just have milk.

86
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,887
- Here's a cup.
- Thank you.

87
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,245
Oh, that stings.

88
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:40,836
Maybe it's the cold wind,
but my lips are so dry.

89
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,536
Hey, what are you doing?
The milk is overflowing!

90
00:04:57,536 --> 00:04:59,646
What am I doing? Gosh!

91
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:02,300
What were you thinking about anyway?

92
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,788
Nothing. It's nothing at all.

93
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:08,504
<i>This is crazy.
Why do I keep thinking about that?</i>

94
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:11,853
I just made some pies.
Do you want to try some?

95
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,886
That's what this nice aroma was.

96
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:18,247
Wow, that looks great!

97
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,788
- Looks good.
- Looks delicious.

98
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:24,637
Joon Ki, have you looked into
how to get money yet?

99
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,173
Wow, the pies turned out great.

100
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:30,795
The shape is so pretty and
Yoon Ah, you're pretty too.

101
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,495
That guy...

102
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:43,182
What are you doing with the food?

103
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:46,812
Yoon Ah, are those walnuts in there?

104
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,634
Yes, why?

105
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:54,319
Soap, soap, antibacterial rinse...

106
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,668
It's just food.

107
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:57,600
Why is he acting like that?

108
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,269
He's allergic to walnuts.

109
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:03,461
He gets hives, chills, and diarrhea
when he eats walnuts.

110
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:05,115
He suffers for about a week.

111
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,591
Oh, I see.

112
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:08,737
Yeah, right.

113
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:12,480
He's acting like that
because I brought up money.

114
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,610
Su Ah, did you sleep well?

115
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,752
What's with the luggage?

116
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,329
I think I should go.

117
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,985
Do you have a place to go?

118
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:22,187
Don't worry.

119
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:25,343
I can get rent money
if I sell all of these.

120
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,346
I put them up online
and I already have a buyer.

121
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,935
Really? You should eat before going.

122
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:32,913
No, it's okay.

123
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,723
I have a conscience, after all.

124
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:37,033
I can't ask any more of you.

125
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:40,384
I'll get going now.
Bye, Dong Gu.

126
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:43,646
Goodbye, everyone.

127
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:46,047
Okay, goodbye.

128
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:49,144
Wow, those are all designer bags.

129
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:50,824
Good thing you guys broke up.

130
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,185
If you had married her,
she'd have bled our household dry.

131
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:55,151
Give it a rest.

132
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,021
I think I bought her one of those bags.

133
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:01,968
Oh, you fool.

134
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,956
Gosh... it's almost time.

135
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,838
Why isn't she coming?

136
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,713
Are you "Bag Shuttle"?

137
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:21,120
Are you "Usain Bolt,"
who wanted to buy the bags?

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,170
- Yes. Hello.
- Hello.

139
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,009
Could I see the bags first?

140
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,254
Yes.

141
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:30,451
I cherished them like I would my life,
so I can guarantee their condition.

142
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,009
Wow! They really look new.

143
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:36,490
- May I try it on?
- Of course.

144
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,646
Wow.

145
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:38,747
Do you want to try this?

146
00:07:38,747 --> 00:07:40,778
- It's so nice.
- Look at the color on this.

147
00:07:40,778 --> 00:07:42,665
Oh, wow!

148
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:45,187
What should I do? I like them all.

149
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:48,057
I will buy all of them.

150
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,163
- How much do you want?
- Really?

151
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:52,324
Hold on.

152
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:53,581
It is...

153
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,793
Oh, my shoelace is undone.

154
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:59,658
Are you good at running, by any chance?

155
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:02,788
Excuse me? Not really.
Why do you ask?

156
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:06,937
I used to be an athlete representing
Seoul in short distance running.

157
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:09,146
Oh, is that so?

158
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:12,396
The start is the most
important thing in running.

159
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:14,247
Take a look.

160
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:18,569
First, you need to get into a position
where you can take off whenever.

161
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,646
Now, say "bang"... "bang."

162
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:23,841
Put three fingers up like this.

163
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:24,944
"Bang."

164
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:26,771
- Put it up.
- Up? Up?

165
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:30,081
- Up, up, up...
- Up... bang!

166
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:35,285
Wow, she is really fast.

167
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,817
She really must be an athlete.

168
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:41,672
Usain Bolt, where are you going?

169
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:43,524
Over here, over here.

170
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:47,023
What the heck? Hey, stop right there!

171
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:48,551
Thief!

172
00:08:55,715 --> 00:09:00,974
Usain Bolt, you awful girl!

173
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:04,697
So cold.

174
00:09:04,697 --> 00:09:07,778
It's so cold.
Why is he calling me out in the morning?

175
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:09,842
Is the director not here yet?

176
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,191
Sorry, are you okay?

177
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:15,129
Yes, I am.

178
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,940
Wait...

179
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,082
Are you Bong Doo Shik?

180
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:22,413
What? Yes, but who...

181
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:25,650
It's me, Mal Geum.
Don't you recognize me?

182
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,083
Mal Geum?

183
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,910
Mal Geum as in Yoojin Elementary School,
Class 6-3. Yoon Mal Geum?

184
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,844
How long has it been?

185
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:34,404
Yeah, I know.

186
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:38,275
You haven't changed at all.
You're still pretty.

187
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,756
Really? You've become handsome.

188
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,509
No, I really haven't.

189
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:44,659
Ah, we should have coffee. I'll buy it.

190
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,619
- Go sit down.
- Okay.

191
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:56,000
Writer Bong, you're here early.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,412
- Yes, you're here?
- Yes.

193
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:58,659
What is this about?

194
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:02,669
We cast the female lead for our film
and I wanted to introduce you to her.

195
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,249
What? You already cast the female lead?

196
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:08,613
Yes, her name is Cherry and
she's a rising star in this industry.

197
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:11,227
You'll like her once you meet her.

198
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:12,232
Cherry?

199
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,263
Oh, she's here already.

200
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:15,428
Cherry.

201
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:18,227
- Hello, Director.
- Hi.

202
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:21,744
Say hello, Writer Bong.
That's the Cherry I was speaking about.

203
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:35,488
I'll get going now.

204
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:37,477
I'll see you next time.

205
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:39,024
- Goodbye, Director.
- Bye.

206
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,686
Goodbye.

207
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:49,690
The script was fun.

208
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,650
You always liked to write as a kid.
I guess you really became a writer.

209
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,019
Huh? Yeah.

210
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,884
You always were mature as a kid.
I guess you became an ero...

211
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,856
Never mind.

212
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,631
I'll get going then.

213
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,809
Which way are you going?
I'm going this way.

214
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:10,118
I'm going this way.

215
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:12,191
See you next time, Cherry...

216
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,960
I mean, Mal Geum.

217
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,855
Okay. Bye, then.

218
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:18,144
Bye.

219
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:35,418
Yeah, it's been a long time.
I just thought of you.

220
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:38,857
You know that it was me who saved you
when you fell in the water, right?

221
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:42,398
Yes, I saved your life. Lee Joon Ki.

222
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:44,207
So, I was wondering
if you had some money.

223
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:46,599
I was... hello?

224
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,200
Hello?

225
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,287
You disloyal punk. I saved your life.

226
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,264
I don't need you! Who needs you?

227
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:54,355
You're back?

228
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,586
What's with the album?

229
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,426
Yoon Mal Geum?

230
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,595
Who is she that you
drew hearts next to her name?

231
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:14,635
My first love.

232
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:16,255
First love?

233
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,775
Wow, she's pretty.

234
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,725
Why are you suddenly
looking at pictures of her?

235
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:22,647
I ran into her today.

236
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:24,135
You ran into her?

237
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:26,017
How did you meet her?

238
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:29,035
<i>As a writer for an erotic film,
and she was the erotic film actress.</i>

239
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,596
Is she still pretty?

240
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:33,059
What happened? What's she doing now?

241
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,573
<i>She's the lead female
of my erotic film script.</i>

242
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:37,946
Are you crying right now?

243
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:41,490
You must be really happy to see
your first love again.

244
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:44,946
- Joon Ki.
- Yeah?

245
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,186
Gosh, you must've been really happy.

246
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,254
You're such an innocent kid.

247
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:52,884
You liked it?

248
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,058
Ah, it's so cold.

249
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:06,186
I have no money or place to go.

250
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,620
My conscience won't allow me
to go back to Dong Gu again.

251
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,354
I'm going crazy.

252
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,740
That nasty girl, Usain Bolt.

253
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,336
Su Ah.

254
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:28,094
- What are you doing here?
- Huh?

255
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:30,453
I was just passing by.

256
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:33,144
Oh, this was your building.

257
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,932
I never even imagined it was.

258
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,369
How could you not know?

259
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,683
You were here every day
just a few months back.

260
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:40,219
Huh?

261
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,479
Well...

262
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,751
I have night blindness,
so I can't see anything at night.

263
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:48,238
Night blindness? You have that?

264
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:51,120
Huh? Uh...

265
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,563
I got it after we broke up.
I must've caught it from someone.

266
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:57,299
My goodness. Min Su Ah.

267
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:00,179
You have nowhere to go, right?
Isn't that why you're here?

268
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,840
No way.

269
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,398
I didn't like any of the places,
so I was taking my time looking.

270
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:09,976
All right, then sleep here tonight
and look around tomorrow.

271
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:12,751
No, I do have a conscience.

272
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,573
How could I burden you again?

273
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:16,480
You said you have night blindness.

274
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,664
You said you can't see a thing at night.

275
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:23,121
Since you are so worried like this,
I'll stay here for just one more night.

276
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,840
Su Ah, go up and rest.

277
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,245
Oh, I can't stand this night blindness.

278
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,505
I really can't.

279
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:49,677
Oh, night blindness!

280
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:51,738
Night blindness, yeah right.

281
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:53,667
She's walking around just fine.

282
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,647
She was going on about her conscience

283
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:56,921
and now she's back?

284
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,897
I don't think she found a place,
so I brought her in.

285
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:01,424
What a load of crap.

286
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,863
Hey, you still have feelings
for Su Ah, don't you?

287
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,589
No, I don't! I don't!

288
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,433
Why would you bring that up here?

289
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,921
Where would I bring it up then?

290
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,804
Should I say it in the kitchen,
bathroom, bedroom, or to Su Ah?

291
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:16,645
Whatever, be quiet!
Did you even get the money?

292
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,546
Oh, this is nice and sweet.

293
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:20,479
I knew it.

294
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:23,798
Don't eat a single thing
until you get the money.

295
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,268
Yoon Ah, don't give this guy
any food starting tomorrow.

296
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,774
What?

297
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:31,647
Fine! You're so cheap and petty
that I won't eat.

298
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:35,335
I'll get that money somehow
and throw it in your face.

299
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,768
Wait and see, you punk!

300
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:39,259
I'm so scared.
I'm sure you'll get that money.

301
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:42,732
So scary! I'm going to pee my pants!

302
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,198
Hello. Yes, Tae Shik.

303
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:48,927
What time is the baby's party
this weekend?

304
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,662
Oh, 2:00 pm.

305
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,495
Okay.

306
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,894
By the way...

307
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:59,423
uh, is there any way
that I can get paid in advance?

308
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:00,678
Yes.

309
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:04,352
If you could pay me two years
in advance, I'd be really thankful--

310
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,958
Hello?

311
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,671
Hello...

312
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:14,304
Yes, two years was asking for too much.

313
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:16,964
Geez... what the heck.

314
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:19,014
What's she doing there?

315
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:22,394
She doesn't even have a blanket.
What if she catches a cold?

316
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:24,005
Hold on.

317
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:27,339
Why am I worried about it?

318
00:16:28,544 --> 00:16:32,812
Why do I keep worrying
about this lady? Why?

319
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:38,232
Gosh...

320
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,203
All right. Yeah.

321
00:16:40,203 --> 00:16:42,904
It's only sympathy.

322
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:46,659
It's like helping those
who are less privileged.

323
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:50,613
I must be crazy. I really am.

324
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:52,623
Oh, the smell.

325
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:54,789
What did she eat?

326
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:57,160
Dong Gu.

327
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,833
Yeah, what? Why? What?

328
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,534
Why are you so startled?

329
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:02,355
It's nothing.

330
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,463
Are you leaving now?

331
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:07,150
I should go. I do have a conscience.

332
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,299
Do you have a place to go?

333
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,349
Yes, I called my friend
and she told me to come.

334
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:15,520
Dong Gu, I really won't ask for
your help and burden you anymore.

335
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,917
Be well.

336
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,387
Yeah. Goodbye.

337
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:20,682
Okay.

338
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:30,231
What's with this lady today?

339
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,633
Does she have bowel issues or what?

340
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,881
Oh, it smells. What did she eat?

341
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:37,481
Oh, my word...

342
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:40,153
Okay, bro.

343
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:43,372
Thanks for the intro. Yeah.

344
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:49,568
Do I really have to do this?

345
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:53,575
I'm going crazy here. Gosh.

346
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,355
<i>I'm going crazy here.</i>

347
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:02,277
<i>Why does Mal Geum have to be
the lead in my film?</i>

348
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:05,606
<i>How am I supposed to look at her again?</i>

349
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:11,809
Did Su Ah leave?

350
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:13,519
She should call or something.

351
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,962
Hey, you worry about Su Ah that much.

352
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,528
Yet, you don't worry about me,
who's suffering this much?

353
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:20,698
Not at all.

354
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:22,698
What's going on with the money?
Did you get it?

355
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:25,167
I'll get it. I said I'll get it!

356
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,718
You expect me to believe that?

357
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:29,559
I'd believe a dog's baby over your words.

358
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,289
Wh... what? A dog's baby?

359
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:35,823
Hey, do you know what I decided to do
just to get that money?

360
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,288
What did you decide?

361
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:38,432
You don't need to know.

362
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:42,685
What are you going to do
if I manage to get the money?

363
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:45,405
If you can get that money...

364
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:49,246
I'll call you Father from now on.

365
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:53,461
You have to crawl through my legs.

366
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:56,857
Race... you can back out
if you're scared.

367
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:58,134
Why would I be scared?

368
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:01,743
Just get the money.
I'll do whatever you say.

369
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:03,262
Kang Dong Gu.

370
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:05,585
You'd better keep your promise.

371
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:09,589
I will get that money,
no matter what.

372
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,516
I will do it.

373
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,602
Mal Geum, you came
to see the audition too?

374
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:27,682
Yes, the director wanted me to come.

375
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:32,112
We're choosing the male lead,
so of course the female lead should see.

376
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:34,652
Okay, let's get started.

377
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:43,541
Hello, I'm the terminator
of the erotic industry.

378
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,821
Deok Chul, Deok Chul.
I am Won Deok Chul!

379
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,023
Yeah!

380
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:51,181
Wow, you have a good body.

381
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:52,446
What do you think, Writer Bong?

382
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:54,509
Don't you think he'd suit Cherry well?

383
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:55,567
What?

384
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,626
<i>Wait.</i>

385
00:19:56,626 --> 00:20:01,221
<i>The guy who gets cast today
will do a bed scene with Mal Geum.</i>

386
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,281
<i>With my precious first love?</i>

387
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:04,685
What do you think, Writer Bong?

388
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:08,211
What? Uh, yes...

389
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:14,329
Everything's good, but his legs are
slightly bowed in an O-shape.

390
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:18,460
Those can't convey
the message of my story properly.

391
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,309
Really? What is the message?

392
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:23,929
An upright and straight heart.

393
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:26,884
Our film has that kind of message?

394
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:27,942
Yes.

395
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:32,040
Hm, everything is good.

396
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,034
But his double eyelid is so deep
that it goes against my plans.

397
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,290
Next person.

398
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,436
Would you like some water?

399
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,424
Hm, everything is good.

400
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:44,407
His collarbones are too prominent
and they don't fit the character.

401
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,509
Writer Bong, you are
pickier than you look.

402
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:54,832
No one feels quite right for this role.

403
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,317
Hello.

404
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:02,039
I'm a rookie actor
in the erotic industry.

405
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,396
My name is Lee Joon Ki.

406
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:07,789
Joon Ki!

407
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:09,478
Doo Shik!

408
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:26,865
So, you were writing
an erotic script all this time?

409
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:30,974
You were the one who wrote
those beastly lines?

410
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:34,986
You said it was a melodrama
about the love of family.

411
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:37,945
- It is, though.
- How is it?

412
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:40,327
"Goodbye, Sister-in-law."

413
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:42,905
I guess you are right.

414
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,213
Why are you here, Joon Ki?

415
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:46,023
I...

416
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:48,240
need to make money.

417
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,669
Dong Gu is harassing me so much.

418
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,548
I have to make money somehow.

419
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:56,218
I'm going to throw it in Dong Gu's face.

420
00:21:56,218 --> 00:21:58,907
Anyway, let's keep this a secret.

421
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:00,432
That's what I want too.

422
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:04,318
Let's take this secret to the grave.

423
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,444
All right, good work on the audition.

424
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:10,241
Let's hear your opinions.

425
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,491
In my opinion...

426
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:15,413
I think Lee Joon Ki is the best.
What do you think?

427
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:17,330
What? Joon Ki?

428
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,500
I think Lee Joon Ki is the best too.

429
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,750
His acting was the best too.

430
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,327
Also, there's something about his eyes.

431
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:27,078
He's a natural erotic film actor.

432
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:29,271
- Writer Bong.
- Yes? I think--

433
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:32,183
If you have no issues with it,
let's go with Lee Joon Ki.

434
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:33,461
We have to film soon.

435
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:36,078
Okay? Okay.

436
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:39,778
- Good.
- I... I...

437
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:42,847
<i>What? Joon Ki is the male lead?</i>

438
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:45,289
<i>Then Joon Ki and Mal Geum
will do a bed scene?</i>

439
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,079
<i>No! That can't happen!</i>

440
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,823
<i>This can't be. It can't!</i>

441
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:51,770
Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

442
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,886
What are you doing right now?

443
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:58,914
Can't you tell?
I'm working on my physique.

444
00:22:58,914 --> 00:23:01,414
The director told me to.

445
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:04,358
He already contacted you?

446
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:06,486
Joon Ki, are you really doing that film?

447
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:10,069
I have to! I'll do it and get paid.

448
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:13,857
I'll make Dong Gu crawl between my legs.

449
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:18,781
Joon Ki, what if your parents
happen to see it later?

450
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:20,741
My parents? It's okay.

451
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:24,383
My parents like erotic films.
They're very open people.

452
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,942
Then, what if your future wife sees it?

453
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,570
My wife? It's okay.

454
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,609
I'll meet someone who likes erotic films.

455
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:36,117
Then, what if your future child sees it?

456
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:38,121
My child? It's okay.

457
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:39,383
I'll watch it with them.

458
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:42,082
Isn't it important
to educate them early on?

459
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,961
Also, is it a crime
to be in an erotic film?

460
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:47,964
This is art too... art.

461
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:50,352
That's true, but still...

462
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:51,692
You wait and see.

463
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:55,053
Since I'm doing it,
I'm going to do my absolute best.

464
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:58,891
I'll film a bed scene that remains
famous in the erotic film industry.

465
00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:05,314
You can't... you can't.

466
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:09,917
Stop, stop! Stop working out!

467
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,328
Why?

468
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,067
Stop it. Stop it.

469
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,704
I've only been eating eggs for days.
Now, my breath smells like rotting eggs.

470
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:29,134
How long do I have to stay here?

471
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:34,108
<i>[Dong Gu]</i>

472
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:42,369
Young lady, how many days
have you been here?

473
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:45,172
- Have you paid for your stay?
- What?

474
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:46,909
Not yet.

475
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:48,421
I was going to pay when I left.

476
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:51,571
Then pay now for
the time you've stayed.

477
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:55,358
Do I look like I'd run off
without paying for staying here?

478
00:24:55,358 --> 00:24:57,306
I'll pay right now.

479
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:05,175
Oh! My wallet.

480
00:25:05,175 --> 00:25:07,345
Ma'am, my wallet was definitely here.

481
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,489
It really was.

482
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:11,896
Okay, I understand.
I suppose that can happen.

483
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:14,055
I'll be on the phone, okay?

484
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:17,567
Hello, is this the police?

485
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,237
Ma'am!

486
00:25:19,237 --> 00:25:23,268
<i>The customer you have dialed
cannot take your call...</i>

487
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:27,381
Su Ah hasn't picked up her phone in days.

488
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:29,141
Do you think something happened to her?

489
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:31,529
Why do you keep worrying about her?

490
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,125
Tell me the truth, Dong Gu.
You're not over her, are you?

491
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,691
You still like her, don't you?

492
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:41,088
Hey, no, I don't. That's not true!

493
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:42,567
Why would you say that here?

494
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,057
Then where would I say it?

495
00:25:44,057 --> 00:25:46,028
Should I say it on
the veranda or the balcony?

496
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:47,895
Just forget it, okay?

497
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:50,827
It's just not like that, all right?

498
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,576
Oh, it's already time to make dinner.

499
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:56,545
I'd better prepare dinner.

500
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:02,313
I told you it's not true.

501
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:04,080
Why are you worried about strange things?

502
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,392
Why are you getting mad at me?

503
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:08,586
Stop saying useless things.

504
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,259
Yoon Ah, do you need help with anything?

505
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:19,128
No, it's fine.

506
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:20,967
Yoon Ah...

507
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:23,877
you're not misunderstanding
anything, are you?

508
00:26:23,877 --> 00:26:24,945
Misunderstanding?

509
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:26,705
About Su Ah, I mean.

510
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:31,132
People help the less privileged,
and even those in Africa.

511
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:34,133
One could help an ex-girlfriend
who's going through a hard time.

512
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,582
That's true.

513
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:40,692
So, I'm saying that doesn't mean
I have feelings for Su Ah.

514
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:45,262
Or that I want to date her again.
It's not like that at all.

515
00:26:45,262 --> 00:26:47,743
Just in case you had the wrong idea.

516
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:51,445
Why would I get the wrong idea?
Take good care of Su Ah.

517
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:55,144
Ah... sure.

518
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:56,267
I will.

519
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:58,634
Dong Gu, I'm going to the store.
Do you want anything?

520
00:26:58,634 --> 00:27:00,055
I don't want to eat anything.

521
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:02,405
No need to get annoyed over it.

522
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:04,070
I'll be back.

523
00:27:08,897 --> 00:27:10,789
My gosh.

524
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:13,510
Looks like she doesn't care at all.

525
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:16,778
You think I care about you, huh?

526
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:19,218
I just didn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

527
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:21,794
I'm not worried about it either.

528
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:25,315
Hello.

529
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:29,333
What? The police station?

530
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:41,500
Dong Gu.

531
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,131
I'm sorry.

532
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:48,330
The policeman insisted
on calling my parents.

533
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,219
I had no choice.

534
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,711
Get up. Let's go.

535
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:08,778
Let go. I'm really not going to go.

536
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:11,334
You have nowhere to go.
What are you going to do?

537
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:12,700
Follow me.

538
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:16,707
Still, this isn't right.
It really isn't right.

539
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:18,198
Why isn't it right?

540
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,788
Think about what I did to you.
How can I ask this of you again?

541
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:24,227
You can ask favors of me.

542
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:27,646
You should've lived
well after you left. What is this?

543
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:36,680
So, stop making me worry and go inside.

544
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:41,808
Look, your hand is all frozen.

545
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:44,355
Follow me.

546
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,003
What's wrong with this bag?

547
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,615
Lee Joon Ki.

548
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:09,136
You brought this all upon yourself.

549
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:12,902
Why did you show up there?

550
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:16,557
Please do not begrudge me.

551
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:26,357
There you go.

552
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:32,755
That tastes good.

553
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:43,569
What is this? What?

554
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:46,472
What's wrong with my face?
What is this?

555
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:49,680
What is it, Joon Ki? Is something wrong?

556
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,300
Oh, my stomach... my stomach.

557
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,742
Oh... Doo Shik.

558
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:59,388
Oh, you have hives all over your face.

559
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:00,690
What will you do?

560
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,648
I know. We have the reading today.

561
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:06,711
The shoot is in a few days too.
What do I do?

562
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:09,070
How can you shoot in this condition?

563
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,440
Your hives take a while to go away
and your diarrhea is severe, too.

564
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,602
I think you have to give up this film.
Right, Joon Ki?

565
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:20,473
Doo Shik, can you talk to the director
and postpone the shoot?

566
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:21,579
Are you crazy?

567
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,960
Do you know what he hates
more than anything?

568
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,154
It's postponing the shoot.

569
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,334
Then what am I supposed to do?

570
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:30,700
What else can you do?
You have to give up on it.

571
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,468
I'll talk to the director and make sure
he doesn't pursue you legally.

572
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:35,980
Just let it go, okay?

573
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,568
Okay... Doo Shik, thank you.

574
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,422
No need to thank me.

575
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:42,346
Where's the hair dryer?

576
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,352
What's wrong with your face?

577
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:49,692
I woke up this morning and I had
hives all over my face and body.

578
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,472
Did you eat something weird?

579
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:53,211
Did you have walnuts?

580
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,269
No, I didn't even go near walnuts.

581
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:57,953
Then why are you like that?

582
00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:01,366
Wait... Joon Ki.

583
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:04,160
You knew you couldn't get money,
so you ate walnuts to put on a show.

584
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,266
What? Hey, you punk.

585
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:08,295
How can you say that to a sick person?

586
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:12,012
You said you would get the money.
This is so like you, Joon Ki.

587
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:15,472
Seriously, you idiot.

588
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:19,145
You arrogant jerk! Hey, hey!

589
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,500
Doo Shik, this won't do.

590
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,675
I'm afraid I have to film this movie.

591
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:28,493
What? What are you saying, suddenly?

592
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:33,208
I can't have that guy
look down on me any longer.

593
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:37,789
Kang Dong Gu, I will destroy you.

594
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,345
Joon Ki... Joon Ki.

595
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:51,968
Gosh.

596
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,833
Joon Ki, don't do this and just give up.

597
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,285
No... I will never give up.

598
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:01,982
Didn't you hear what
Kang Dong Gu said to me?

599
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,433
Still, how can you shoot
a film in this state?

600
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:09,390
No, even if I die on set,
I will never give up.

601
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,019
I will never give up!

602
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,726
Seriously! Just don't do it!

603
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,949
Why the heck are you yelling?

604
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:19,528
Is there a reason
why I can't do your film?

605
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:21,492
The thing is...

606
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:25,422
it's my first love!

607
00:33:39,492 --> 00:33:41,297
Do you love me?

608
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,808
Since when have I been your first love?

609
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:45,623
What are you talking about?

610
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,449
Mal Geum, Mal Geum, Mal Geum!
She's my first love.

611
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:52,682
Yes, Mal Geum was my nickname
before I was born. How did you know?

612
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:53,825
I'm talking about Cherry!

613
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,000
Cherry is Mal Geum, my first love!

614
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,311
Huh? Mal Geum...

615
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:01,241
The Mal Geum in your album?

616
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:03,730
- Mal Geum is Cherry?
- Yes.

617
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,949
Joon Ki, so please don't do it.
Please, please don't.

618
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,347
Oh, I see.

619
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:13,547
Why didn't you just
say so earlier, Doo Shik?

620
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:16,278
- But, I have to film this movie.
- Why?

621
00:34:16,278 --> 00:34:20,487
I have to do it and have Kang Dong Gu
crawl between my legs!

622
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:22,119
Otherwise, I'll die of rage.

623
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,844
Joon Ki, okay.

624
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:27,844
Then you just need to get revenge
on Dong Gu, right?

625
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:30,644
- Yes.
- Then how about this?

626
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:34,068
What?

627
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:37,384
Joon Ki went to the army at that age?

628
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:41,210
Yes, they showed up this morning
and forcefully dragged him away.

629
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,541
It seems he pulled all sorts of
dirty tricks to avoid the army.

630
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,552
What do we do?

631
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:49,371
What can we do?
There's no actor, so we need to postpone.

632
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:51,943
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

633
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:55,954
Also, the payment for your script
has been deposited, Writer Bong.

634
00:34:55,954 --> 00:34:58,458
- You can check.
- Yes, thank you.

635
00:35:00,637 --> 00:35:01,786
Geez.

636
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:05,440
We even kissed in front of people
and she doesn't care?

637
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,985
Fine, I won't care anymore either.

638
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:15,974
Hey, Kang Dong Gu.

639
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:19,293
What's with that arrogant pose?

640
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:29,360
What are you doing?

641
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:32,902
Pay the landlord with that money.

642
00:35:32,902 --> 00:35:36,235
Use the remaining money
to buy snacks, kid.

643
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:39,092
It's real money.

644
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:40,913
How did you get all this money, Joon Ki?

645
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:42,927
You don't need to know!

646
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:44,842
What do you mean, Joon Ki?

647
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,639
You need to call me "Father."

648
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,516
You really want me to do that?

649
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:52,186
You wouldn't go back
on your word, would you?

650
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:56,286
Not the great Kang Dong Gu.
That would be petty.

651
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:59,105
Oh, gosh.

652
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:01,405
- Give it back, then.
- Father.

653
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:03,268
Yes, Son.

654
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,384
There was one more thing
you had promised me.

655
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:13,197
You want me to do that now?

656
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:15,516
You wouldn't go back
on your word, would you?

657
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:19,596
Not the great Kang Dong Gu.
That would be petty.

658
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,320
I'll do it! I can do it.

659
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,329
I'll do it.

660
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,206
Okay, Son.

661
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:30,715
Your dad is here.

662
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:33,664
Come to your father.

663
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:37,487
You worked hard for the money, Father.

664
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,851
Yes, Son. Come to your father.

665
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:44,516
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

666
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:49,467
It's been hard
for your father to raise you.

667
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:52,806
It's not right, you disobedient child.

668
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:58,875
I am your father starting today.

669
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,456
Yeehaw!

670
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,896
This soybean paste stew is delicious.

671
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:08,414
Yoon Ah, it's really good.

672
00:37:08,414 --> 00:37:11,403
- Really? Eat lots, everyone.
- Yes.

673
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:14,617
Dong Gu, don't you have your appetite
back with the seizure stickers gone?

674
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:19,581
Yes, I can finally sleep now that
we paid the landlady back.

675
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:22,842
Kids, you know who
to thank for all of this.

676
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:25,588
Stop showing off about it, Joon Ki.

677
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:28,869
What did you call me?

678
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:32,101
Stop showing off, Father.

679
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:33,690
All right, Son.

680
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,666
I'll control it.

681
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:37,880
Son? What's that about?

682
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,371
I don't know. It's just something.

683
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:41,864
- Good morning.
- You're awake?

684
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,603
Su Ah, what is that? Do you have a cold?

685
00:37:44,603 --> 00:37:47,389
This? It help the cheeks from drooping.

686
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:48,751
All models need it.

687
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:50,298
Model, what a joke.

688
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:52,422
You've never even been on a runway.

689
00:37:52,422 --> 00:37:54,311
- Hey.
- I thought her jaw came loose.

690
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:59,545
Oh, Seo Jin.
You say the cutest things.

691
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:03,659
Oh my. Do you still have a mustache?

692
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:06,889
You have to put on cream if you're
shaving or your skin gets damaged.

693
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,880
Be careful of that.

694
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:11,929
Oh, it smells like fermented soybeans.

695
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,559
What? You don't like this stew?

696
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,103
It's not that.

697
00:38:16,103 --> 00:38:19,148
It's nice to have something light
like Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

698
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,255
What?

699
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,373
It's nothing.

700
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:27,269
I'll starve for the sake of my diet.

701
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:29,327
Enjoy your meal.

702
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:33,057
She is so simple-minded.
She seems happy.

703
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,820
Did she get scammed or is she camping?

704
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,744
I can't tell with her.

705
00:38:37,744 --> 00:38:39,873
I really don't like her.

706
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:42,039
Dong Gu, when is she leaving?

707
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,166
Dream on.

708
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:46,884
Su Ah isn't staying here for free.
She's a long-term guest.

709
00:38:46,884 --> 00:38:50,023
It's a 100 percent deferred payment
with no time limit on the payment.

710
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:52,672
Your great brother even wrote up
a contract with her yesterday.

711
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,539
What? Are you crazy?

712
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:56,166
Why are you telling everyone?

713
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,610
Su Ah said she'd pay me back.

714
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,965
You fool.

715
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:01,985
- How long will you be manipulated?
- Fool?

716
00:39:01,985 --> 00:39:03,085
You'd better stop.

717
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:06,264
Su Ah may be immature,
but she has a kind heart.

718
00:39:06,264 --> 00:39:08,309
She's kind? Her?

719
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:11,974
What's with you, Son?
Why do you keep taking Su Ah's side?

720
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,244
Your father won't have
a daughter-in-law like that, so dream on.

721
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:19,650
Daughter-in-law?
I told you it's not like that.

722
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,336
Yoon Ah, I told you before.
It's really not like that.

723
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:24,672
I have no feelings for Su Ah.

724
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,764
- What?
- What's with you, Son?

725
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:31,204
Why would you explain to Yoon Ah?

726
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:34,012
Are you interested in Yoon Ah?

727
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,269
Are you with both girls?

728
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:36,994
You can't have two households!

729
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:39,217
Interested in her?

730
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,302
Seriously! You're full of it.

731
00:39:42,302 --> 00:39:43,766
- You scared me.
- I nearly broke the table.

732
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,445
- What?
- Stop it!

733
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:48,614
Hey, hey. Son, Son!

734
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:52,759
Look at his manners at the table
when his father is here.

735
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:54,514
I'm going crazy here.

736
00:39:54,514 --> 00:39:57,434
Why do I keep caring
what that lady thinks?

737
00:39:57,434 --> 00:40:01,451
I must be crazy. I'm crazy.
I'm seriously crazy.

738
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:12,650
Son, didn't your dad tell you that you'd
become a pig if you read in bed?

739
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,181
Give it a rest.

740
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,617
Please give it a rest, Father.

741
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:19,268
I'm going to run away from home
if you don't stop.

742
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:21,672
- How long are you keeping this up?
- I don't know.

743
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,994
Until I'm no longer angry.

744
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:26,902
That will be a long time from now.

745
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:31,213
What kind of a rude child looks down
when his dad is talking?

746
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:37,590
<i>Doo Shik, you haven't forgotten
about meeting later, right?</i>

747
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,831
<i>See you later.</i>

748
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:41,929
What is it? Who is it from
that you're so happy?

749
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:44,318
Huh? Oh, Mal Geum.

750
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,909
Mal Geum?

751
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:49,197
Ah, you mean Cherry?

752
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:52,001
Who is that?

753
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:55,505
- Who's Mal Geum and who's Cherry?
- Huh?

754
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:59,501
She's my classmate from primary school
and she lived in the US.

755
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,541
Her English name is Cherry
and Korean name is Mal Geum.

756
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:04,601
Oh, a girl?

757
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:07,827
Things must be going well.
You two are texting and all.

758
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:10,068
I don't know about going well.
We're just friends.

759
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,983
Hey, it goes from
friend, to girlfriend, to wife.

760
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:15,965
From wife, to your enemy,
to the courtroom and you get divorced.

761
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:17,250
So, make it work.

762
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,416
Honestly, I do think about
Mal Geum a lot.

763
00:41:21,416 --> 00:41:25,697
I don't know if it's because I like her
or if it's because she's an old friend.

764
00:41:25,697 --> 00:41:27,056
Why don't you know?

765
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:30,827
If you like someone,
your heart races like crazy.

766
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:32,494
You hands and feet tingle.

767
00:41:32,494 --> 00:41:35,929
You come out of it as if
you were hit by a hammer.

768
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:38,804
I do like being with Mal Geum.

769
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:40,789
How should I put it?

770
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,864
I don't feel certain.

771
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:45,648
Certain... certain...

772
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:51,717
There is a way to know
in times like this.

773
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,318
Should I tell you?

774
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:54,601
What is it?

775
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:56,170
You know NASA, right?

776
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,086
The USA's space program.

777
00:41:58,086 --> 00:42:00,789
This is a method developed by
Richard Friedman.

778
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:04,201
It took five years to calculate it
using a super computer.

779
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:05,699
Really? What is it?

780
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:07,324
- Are you curious?
- Yeah.

781
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:21,853
We're almost there. Okay.

782
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:24,503
We have the answer.

783
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:27,474
The chances that you like Mal Geum
are 80 percent... 80 percent.

784
00:42:27,474 --> 00:42:30,717
It's correct.
You definitely like Mal Geum.

785
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:32,108
Are you kidding me?

786
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:34,416
How can this tell me
if I like her or not?

787
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:37,423
Hey, this is strangely quite accurate.

788
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:42,153
Now, should I check to see if your
love with her will work out or not?

789
00:42:42,153 --> 00:42:43,199
Yes.

790
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,730
Look carefully.
I need a mechanical pencil.

791
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,820
Get it ready.

792
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,016
First, you draw a heart
with the mechanical pencil.

793
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:54,197
Then let the lead out.
Just let it out, very long.

794
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:57,913
Make it as long as possible
and then start coloring the heart.

795
00:42:57,913 --> 00:42:59,670
Keep coloring it like this.

796
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,184
If you can color this heart
without the lead breaking on you

797
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:04,789
your love with her will come true--

798
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:05,800
Shut up!

799
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,940
I'm the crazy one for asking you.

800
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,088
- Oh?
- Gosh.

801
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,152
Hey, this is extremely accurate.

802
00:43:14,152 --> 00:43:16,657
Hey, it's true! Let's color it.

803
00:43:16,657 --> 00:43:19,193
I'm crazy for expecting anything.

804
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:21,987
Why doesn't he ever grow up?

805
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:27,494
<i>[When A Man Loves]</i>

806
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,679
<i>[Kang Dong Gu, Han Yoon Ah]</i>

807
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:40,219
What? 76 percent?

808
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,471
Then, I like Yoon Ah 76 percent?

809
00:43:43,471 --> 00:43:45,380
Does that make sense?

810
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,237
No, that can't be.

811
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,907
<i>[Park Myung Ja's Pork Stew Rice]</i>
Park Myung Ja.

812
00:44:05,795 --> 00:44:07,369
91 percent!

813
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:11,329
So, I like Park Myung Ja 91 percent,
though I've never seen her?

814
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:12,376
Does that make sense?

815
00:44:12,376 --> 00:44:15,327
Sure, they have very good pork stew rice.

816
00:44:15,327 --> 00:44:19,262
That doesn't mean
I like Park Myung Ja, right?

817
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:22,795
Whatever.

818
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:27,621
There's no way this is right.

819
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,344
I told you to come down...

820
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:43,277
- Su Ah, what are you doing?
- Hm?

821
00:44:43,277 --> 00:44:45,559
Uh, well I was...

822
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,932
Hold on.

823
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:52,393
Were you planning to
wash your face with milk?

824
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:54,436
No, I wasn't going to do that.

825
00:44:54,436 --> 00:44:57,067
Then why did you pour milk
into the wash basin?

826
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:59,056
Well...

827
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:00,143
I was going to drink it.

828
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:01,748
I really like milk a lot.

829
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:05,248
Is that right? Then drink it.

830
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:07,706
Hm? Right now?

831
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,764
You said you poured it to drink it.

832
00:45:09,764 --> 00:45:12,188
What are you doing? Drink it.

833
00:45:13,164 --> 00:45:15,661
I was going to drink it anyway.

834
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:21,721
You'd better not leave one drop.

835
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:24,911
I'll just kick you out of here.

836
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,213
Sorry, sorry!

837
00:45:29,213 --> 00:45:31,175
Okay, I was going to
wash my face with it.

838
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:33,644
What? Who do you think you are to yell?

839
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:36,224
- What did I do?
- Why is it so loud?

840
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:37,505
What is it?

841
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:38,782
Look at this.

842
00:45:38,782 --> 00:45:42,987
Su Ah was going to use
the breakfast milk to wash her face.

843
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:45,088
What? Why would you?

844
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:46,809
I have to take care of my skin.

845
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:49,259
All models do it.

846
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:52,668
Dong Gu, you can add
the cost of milk to my stay.

847
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:53,947
Satisfied?

848
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:57,449
What kind of person does that?

849
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:59,929
She has nothing and
she's washing her face with milk.

850
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:03,028
Isn't she even sorry to us?

851
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,641
She says all models do it.

852
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,489
Let's stop and just go.

853
00:46:08,157 --> 00:46:11,626
Oh, that fool. I'm going crazy.

854
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:14,545
I'm certain that Dong Gu
still has feelings for her.

855
00:46:14,545 --> 00:46:17,179
What if they start dating again?

856
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:20,389
Dong Gu suffered a lot
after breaking up with Su Ah.

857
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:22,637
It'll be good if things work out well.

858
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:26,737
What a waste.

859
00:46:26,737 --> 00:46:29,318
We don't even have guests and
she washes her face with milk.

860
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:30,409
Stop it, would you?

861
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:31,637
How can I stop?

862
00:46:31,637 --> 00:46:33,715
We have no milk,
so we have to eat it like this.

863
00:46:33,715 --> 00:46:34,891
Then don't eat it!

864
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:37,204
Look at this.

865
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:39,650
Even Doo Shik is so upset
that he's sighing over it.

866
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,282
That's not it.

867
00:46:41,282 --> 00:46:43,389
Doo Shik met his first love again.

868
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:45,855
He's confused about
whether he likes her or not.

869
00:46:45,855 --> 00:46:47,742
What? Why would you be confused?

870
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:50,552
I don't know. I'm just confused.

871
00:46:50,552 --> 00:46:51,652
Really?

872
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:55,702
When I like someone,
I can even recognize their footsteps.

873
00:46:55,702 --> 00:46:57,668
You recognize their footsteps?

874
00:46:57,668 --> 00:46:59,385
That's a load of crap.

875
00:46:59,385 --> 00:47:03,925
You're interested in everything
about the person that you like.

876
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:07,730
Then you end up knowing the sound
of that person's footsteps too.

877
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,945
Ah...

878
00:47:08,945 --> 00:47:12,563
Then you must've known that
Tae Hyun snot guy's footsteps too.

879
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,846
Could you recognize
the sound of him picking his nose?

880
00:47:14,846 --> 00:47:17,597
Hey, I told you not to bring him up.

881
00:47:17,597 --> 00:47:19,432
That hurts. Stop hitting me.

882
00:47:19,432 --> 00:47:22,119
- I'm hitting you to hurt you!
- Don't use so much force.

883
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,153
You're so strong that I'm so miserable.

884
00:47:25,153 --> 00:47:27,523
I'm telling you that I'm right.

885
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:30,362
This theory has been proven.

886
00:47:30,362 --> 00:47:31,610
You think that makes sense?

887
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,742
I'm telling you I'm right.

888
00:47:33,742 --> 00:47:37,820
Hey, how can you tell if you
like someone by footsteps?

889
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,480
- Does that make sense?
- What about you?

890
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,409
Does the name compatibility make sense?

891
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:42,630
Of course.

892
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:46,501
Name compatibility was developed by
NASA's Richard Friedman.

893
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:48,934
He used a super computer--

894
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:54,268
Ow...ow!

895
00:47:54,268 --> 00:47:56,619
What is it? Are you sick?

896
00:47:56,619 --> 00:47:58,869
It's my heart.

897
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:02,010
- My heart...
- What about your heart?

898
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,237
- My heart is racing so fast.
- What?

899
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:06,813
- Why?
- I don't know.

900
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:10,628
My heart started beating as soon as
I saw that woman who passed by.

901
00:48:10,628 --> 00:48:12,086
I can't breathe.

902
00:48:12,086 --> 00:48:15,014
My hands are tingling
like there's an electric current.

903
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:20,036
These are the early symptoms
of falling in love.

904
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:22,525
Love? You think that makes sense?

905
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,873
Why not?

906
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:27,054
Fine, then I'll confirm it.

907
00:48:27,054 --> 00:48:28,418
How?

908
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:31,782
I'll find out her name
and check our compatibility.

909
00:48:31,782 --> 00:48:35,400
I have my chance to prove
Richard Friedman's theory.

910
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,884
That woman...

911
00:48:38,304 --> 00:48:39,905
It's her.

912
00:48:42,092 --> 00:48:44,635
Why would he prove it? He's crazy.

913
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:47,190
Joon Ki, where are you going? Joon Ki!

914
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:53,876
Excuse me, wait!

915
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:55,255
Wait!

916
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:57,858
Excuse me! Wait, wait!

917
00:48:57,858 --> 00:48:59,876
Gosh, she went up.

918
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:02,567
- I'm going crazy.
- What's with you, Joon Ki?

919
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:04,572
Pull yourself together.

920
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:09,585
Seo Jin, that woman
could be my soul mate.

921
00:49:09,585 --> 00:49:11,615
She's just a woman
you bumped into on the street.

922
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,005
That's why I need to check.

923
00:49:14,005 --> 00:49:17,110
I only need her name, just her name.

924
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:20,315
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

925
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,014
What's with this?
Who left the TV on?

926
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:35,802
- You scared me!
- Shh... quiet.

927
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:37,880
Seo Jin will get mad at me.

928
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,800
Seo Jin went out with Joon Ki.

929
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,751
Really? I hid for no reason, then.

930
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,197
You scared me there.

931
00:49:49,994 --> 00:49:52,824
I wanted to watch TV
and I had to do a massage.

932
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,097
I was hiding from Seo Jin.

933
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:56,081
Ah, I see.

934
00:49:56,081 --> 00:49:58,378
You did the right thing. You did.

935
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:01,552
Seo Jin must be coming. It's Seo Jin.

936
00:50:01,552 --> 00:50:05,327
That's not Seo Jin. It's Yoon Ah.

937
00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:07,181
I'm home.

938
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:08,945
- Hi.
- It really is.

939
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:11,726
How did you know
just by hearing her footsteps?

940
00:50:11,726 --> 00:50:13,856
Huh? I don't know.

941
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:18,233
When I like someone,
I can even recognize their footsteps.

942
00:50:22,704 --> 00:50:26,327
<i>What? How do I know Yoon Ah's footsteps?</i>

943
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:29,126
<i>Does that mean I like her?</i>

944
00:50:31,885 --> 00:50:35,304
Why are you looking at me like that?
It's kind of rude.

945
00:50:35,304 --> 00:50:37,443
Oh, it's nothing.

946
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,971
<i>It can't be. I like her?</i>

947
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,731
<i>Does that make sense? That can't be.</i>

948
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:46,585
<i>Yes, this is because
I have very good hearing.</i>

949
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,045
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

950
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,971
<i>Oh, someone's coming again.</i>

951
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:54,820
<i>These footsteps belong to...</i>

952
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,842
<i>the deliveryman?</i>

953
00:50:55,842 --> 00:50:56,940
You have a delivery!

954
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,025
Okay, I was right! Deliveryman!

955
00:50:59,025 --> 00:51:01,132
- Deliveryman!
- Here.

956
00:51:01,132 --> 00:51:03,789
Thank you. Thank you so much.

957
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:04,864
What are you doing?

958
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:09,016
I just have good hearing.
I have really good hearing!

959
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:14,692
Thank you! Thank you, Mister Deliveryman!

960
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:20,391
Cheers.

961
00:51:26,188 --> 00:51:28,867
Wow, you're good at drinking, Mal Geum.

962
00:51:28,867 --> 00:51:31,947
No, I'm usually not much of a drinker.

963
00:51:31,947 --> 00:51:34,101
Today, I feel like drinking.

964
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:38,027
Honestly, today's my birthday.

965
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:40,177
Huh? Birthday?

966
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,115
Why didn't you say anything?

967
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:44,166
I would've bought you
a present if I had known.

968
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:48,106
It's okay. It's enough of a present
for you to drink with me.

969
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:51,407
Shouldn't you have a party
with friends if it's your birthday?

970
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:53,945
Or have dinner with your parents?

971
00:51:54,818 --> 00:52:00,311
Actually, I'm not so close with my
parents since I started working.

972
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:02,416
I haven't seen them in a long time.

973
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:04,597
Same for my friends, too.

974
00:52:08,927 --> 00:52:12,092
Let's stop talking about
depressing topics and just drink.

975
00:52:12,092 --> 00:52:13,561
Sure.

976
00:52:17,027 --> 00:52:18,277
Give that to me.

977
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:25,311
Mal Geum, I'll be in
the restroom for a moment.

978
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:26,666
Go ahead.

979
00:52:32,313 --> 00:52:35,003
- What's with the ramen?
- Hm?

980
00:52:35,003 --> 00:52:36,353
I was a little hungry.

981
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:41,152
You work so hard on your skin,
but you're allowed to eat ramen?

982
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:45,403
Oh, that's good.

983
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:47,353
I'll be at the grocery store.

984
00:52:47,353 --> 00:52:50,699
Yoon Ah, you said you had a lot to buy,
so I'll go with you.

985
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:52,503
Ah, okay.

986
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,644
Su Ah, do you want to come too?

987
00:52:54,644 --> 00:52:57,166
No, cold air is bad for the skin.

988
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,378
I am a model, after all.

989
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:01,231
Then, we'll be back.

990
00:53:01,231 --> 00:53:03,286
I'll clean up, here so go on.

991
00:53:03,286 --> 00:53:04,358
Okay.

992
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:10,820
What happened?

993
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:12,972
Are you okay, Su Ah?

994
00:53:12,972 --> 00:53:15,172
Yes, I'm okay.

995
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:19,318
What do you mean?
You're bleeding a lot.

996
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:21,550
Yoon Ah, where's our first aid kit?

997
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:23,619
It's in the living room. I'll get it.

998
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:25,668
No, I'll get it.

999
00:53:25,668 --> 00:53:27,878
Yoon Ah, you should go to the store.

1000
00:53:27,878 --> 00:53:29,773
I'm sorry I can't go with you.

1001
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:32,764
It's okay. You should treat
Su Ah right away.

1002
00:53:32,764 --> 00:53:35,438
Okay. See you later.

1003
00:53:35,438 --> 00:53:39,623
Su Ah, I'll get the
first aid kit. Wait here.

1004
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,407
I just need the name... her name.

1005
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:48,731
Gosh, seriously.

1006
00:53:49,483 --> 00:53:51,563
No, not here.

1007
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,574
Let's stop now.

1008
00:53:56,574 --> 00:53:59,090
How can we find her in this big building?

1009
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,190
Why? Are you afraid?

1010
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:03,300
That Richard Friedman might be right?

1011
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,092
Who the heck is this Richard Friedman?

1012
00:54:06,092 --> 00:54:07,273
Look forward to it.

1013
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:10,414
You'll see how scientific
the name compatibility is.

1014
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,056
I will prove it to you.

1015
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:22,911
<i>[Cardiologist]</i>
Doctor Kim Hyo Jung.

1016
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:24,911
Seo Jin, this is her, right?

1017
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:26,373
How would I know?

1018
00:54:26,373 --> 00:54:27,740
I'm certain this is her.

1019
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:32,643
As soon as I saw the picture,
my heart started racing again.

1020
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:45,369
99... 99 percent.

1021
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,978
You see? Do you still not get it?

1022
00:54:47,978 --> 00:54:51,036
Hyo Jung and I are soul mates.

1023
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:53,847
How would you know through
this name compatibility test?

1024
00:54:53,847 --> 00:54:55,498
Kang Seo Jin.

1025
00:54:55,498 --> 00:54:57,217
Just acknowledge it already.

1026
00:54:57,217 --> 00:55:01,039
You're being disgraceful right now.

1027
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,231
Richard Friedman's theory
has been proven.

1028
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:06,797
I'd better go meet Hyo Jung.

1029
00:55:06,797 --> 00:55:08,947
- Really?
- Yes.

1030
00:55:08,947 --> 00:55:11,036
Hyo Jung.

1031
00:55:11,036 --> 00:55:12,949
Hyo Jung, Hyo Jung.

1032
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:16,130
Do whatever you want.
I just don't know anymore.

1033
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:19,398
Why am I so curious though?

1034
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,233
Come on in.

1035
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:23,996
Hyo Jung.

1036
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:28,273
- Sit down.
- Yes.

1037
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:35,853
What part of you is feeling unwell?

1038
00:55:35,853 --> 00:55:38,862
It's my heart.

1039
00:55:38,862 --> 00:55:40,789
It's beating so hard.

1040
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:41,869
Since when?

1041
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:46,302
After I saw a beautiful woman,
it started to beat very suddenly.

1042
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:49,722
Then I confirmed our
name compatibility was 99 percent.

1043
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:52,050
I felt like my heart would burst.

1044
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,485
Any other symptoms?

1045
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:58,237
I feel very dizzy in the head.
My hands and feet are tingly.

1046
00:55:58,237 --> 00:56:01,391
I feel like there's electricity
and I'm short of breath.

1047
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,206
Really? Let me take a listen
with my stethoscope.

1048
00:56:04,206 --> 00:56:06,016
No, Hyo Jung. There's no need.

1049
00:56:06,016 --> 00:56:09,239
Oh, Hyo Jung. That's cold.

1050
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,670
- Oh? Oh?
- Oh...

1051
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,769
- Why is it like this?
- Why am I like this?

1052
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:17,539
- The sound of your heart...
- Can you hear it?

1053
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:19,820
Something's off about it.

1054
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:23,882
The symptoms you told me about are
bothering me. You need to be examined.

1055
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:26,775
Nurse Kim,
please prepare a complete exam.

1056
00:56:26,775 --> 00:56:28,199
- Wait.
- Let's go.

1057
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:30,507
What's going on?

1058
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:33,773
What's going on...

1059
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:37,596
What on earth is going on?

1060
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:41,054
Excuse me.

1061
00:56:41,054 --> 00:56:42,744
What's going on here?

1062
00:56:42,744 --> 00:56:45,952
Patient, we're starting now.
Please don't move.

1063
00:56:45,952 --> 00:56:46,960
Okay.

1064
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,726
What's going on here?

1065
00:56:49,726 --> 00:56:52,949
What is this, suddenly?

1066
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:57,342
Oh! I'm going in.

1067
00:57:03,996 --> 00:57:05,684
Doo Shik, what took you so long?

1068
00:57:05,684 --> 00:57:08,134
Is the restroom that far?

1069
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:09,414
Ta-da.

1070
00:57:09,414 --> 00:57:10,472
What's with the cake?

1071
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:13,657
It is your birthday.
You should have a cake.

1072
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:14,896
Thank you, Doo Shik.

1073
00:57:14,896 --> 00:57:16,054
You don't need to thank me.

1074
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:18,168
It's my friend's birthday,
so I should get the cake.

1075
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,804
Here you go.

1076
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:22,309
Excuse me.

1077
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:25,699
Are you an actor, by any chance?

1078
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,632
What?

1079
00:57:28,632 --> 00:57:29,677
Yes.

1080
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:32,856
See, I told you so. I told you.

1081
00:57:32,856 --> 00:57:38,240
So, what have you been in?
Films, TV dramas?

1082
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,322
Well...

1083
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,697
Sorry, but we're talking right now.

1084
00:57:41,697 --> 00:57:44,416
Ah! I just remembered it!

1085
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:47,284
"Bikini Investigation," that erotic film!

1086
00:57:47,284 --> 00:57:49,815
You were in that, right?

1087
00:57:49,815 --> 00:57:53,164
I knew I had seen you in something.

1088
00:57:53,164 --> 00:57:54,735
It was that.

1089
00:57:54,735 --> 00:57:58,431
You're all covered up right now.

1090
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:01,710
Wow, your body is really...

1091
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,864
the best!

1092
00:58:03,864 --> 00:58:07,204
It's an honor to meet you.
May I shake your hand?

1093
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,632
You don't want to?

1094
00:58:13,632 --> 00:58:15,068
Is she playing hard to get?

1095
00:58:15,068 --> 00:58:16,228
Sorry, but we're--

1096
00:58:16,228 --> 00:58:18,829
Forget it. Forget it. Never mind!

1097
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:22,438
She thinks she's a star.
She's nothing but an erotic film actress.

1098
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:24,449
Yeah, I'm in erotic films. So what?

1099
00:58:24,449 --> 00:58:30,289
If I act in erotic films, do I have to
shake hands with rude people?

1100
00:58:30,289 --> 00:58:32,688
Oh, she has quite the temper.

1101
00:58:32,688 --> 00:58:35,940
That's how she could be so bold
in those films and...

1102
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,983
What did you say?
What did you just say?

1103
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:40,557
Mal Geum, Mal Geum.
Let it go. Let's just leave.

1104
00:58:40,557 --> 00:58:43,297
- Oh.
- They're leaving.

1105
00:58:43,297 --> 00:58:44,922
She's very daring and bold.

1106
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:47,061
What a joke.

1107
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:56,998
How is it now? Does it still hurt?

1108
00:58:56,998 --> 00:58:58,250
No, it's okay.

<i>[Large Grocery Store Fire, Huam-Dong]</i>

1111
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:04,635
There was a fire.

1112
00:59:04,635 --> 00:59:07,545
Wait, isn't that this neighborhood?

1113
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:09,242
Oh, it is.

1114
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:12,115
Oh, looks like a big fire.

1115
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:16,496
Didn't Yoon Ah say she was
going to the grocery store?

1116
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,552
Oh, Joon Ki.

1117
00:59:27,552 --> 00:59:29,594
Sit, sit.

1118
00:59:31,103 --> 00:59:33,990
What did the doctor say?
What are your results?

1119
00:59:34,894 --> 00:59:37,007
The thing is...

1120
00:59:37,893 --> 00:59:39,652
I don't have a good heart.

1121
00:59:39,652 --> 00:59:40,746
What?

1122
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:45,775
My heart beating fast, shortness of
breath, and tingly hands and feet...

1123
00:59:45,775 --> 00:59:47,614
that's all because of a heart problem.

1124
00:59:47,614 --> 00:59:49,934
- Is it very bad?
- No.

1125
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:54,615
Thankfully, they found it early enough
that it'll be okay once I take medicine.

1126
00:59:54,615 --> 00:59:56,253
What a relief.

1127
00:59:56,253 --> 00:59:59,224
I thought you were really sick
and I was worried.

1128
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:02,498
Hey, how do you think I felt?

1129
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:06,304
I was so scared in there
that I nearly peed.

1130
01:00:06,304 --> 01:00:09,686
What did you say?
Love at first sight?

1131
01:00:09,686 --> 01:00:10,943
Soul mates?

1132
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:13,706
I'm embarrassed already, so stop.

1133
01:00:13,706 --> 01:00:15,972
Also, it is sort like a soul mate.

1134
01:00:15,972 --> 01:00:20,657
If I hadn't met that doctor earlier,
I could've met an untimely death.

1135
01:00:20,657 --> 01:00:22,702
There couldn't be a more dramatic fate.

1136
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,235
Yeah, I guess the heavens
intended for you two to meet.

1137
01:00:26,235 --> 01:00:28,891
This can't be, though.

1138
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:32,460
Our names had a 99 percent compatibility.
You saw that.

1139
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,557
Stop it with the name compatibility.

1140
01:00:34,557 --> 01:00:36,728
- Does that make sense?
- What about you?

1141
01:00:36,728 --> 01:00:39,429
You said you recognize the person's
footsteps if you like them.

1142
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:43,157
I'm just saying that's how it is.

1143
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:45,565
Honestly, forget about
the name compatibility and all that.

1144
01:00:45,565 --> 01:00:48,032
Isn't it always the same
when you like someone?
