1
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:12,849
It was you, wasn't it?

2
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:14,884
You did it, didn't you?

3
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:17,654
That's right. I stopped the news from being released.

4
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:20,724
Don't you know that the anchor has editorial rights?

5
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:22,092
What?

6
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,160
How can you still call yourself a journalist?

7
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:25,562
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

8
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,864
Stop acting so innocent.

9
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:30,100
You...

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,168
You'll...

11
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:35,071
end up getting hurt.

12
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:37,874
What? You jerk.

13
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:41,278
Cut.

14
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:43,546
That was great. Let's move on to the next scene.

15
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,548
Are you all right?

16
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,050
I don't quite know how to control myself yet.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,585
It's all right.

18
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:50,120
That can always happen while acting.

19
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:51,721
Don't worry about it.

20
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:53,223
Thank you for understanding.

21
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:55,625
Jun Ki. Here's you cell phone.

22
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:58,328
It's been ringing nonstop for a while. Answer it.

23
00:00:58,328 --> 00:00:59,729
I see. Thank you.

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,633
Hello? Yes. This is Lee Jun Ki speaking.

25
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,170
Excuse me?

26
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,008
Yes. Yes. I understand.

27
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,647
What was that about?

28
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:20,417
Well, you see,

29
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:24,020
I was just offered to appear in a commercial.

30
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:26,690
On top of that, it's a coffee commercial.

31
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:27,924
What?

32
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:30,727
Gosh. Even I haven't been in a coffee commercial yet.

33
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:32,829
Congratulations, Jun Ki.

34
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:34,631
That's awesome.

35
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,366
Thank you.

36
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:47,877
(The Morning Dew in Columbia)

37
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:50,447
Don't you know that the anchor has editorial rights?

38
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:51,681
What?

39
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:53,383
How can you still call yourself a journalist?

40
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:54,584
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

41
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:56,586
Stop acting so innocent.

42
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:59,689
You'll end up getting hurt.

43
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,191
You jerk.

44
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:02,492
Stop!

45
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:06,029
My goodness. See that look on my face.

46
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:08,631
Don't I look really charismatic?

47
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,734
You jerk.

48
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:13,536
Wasn't that amazing? Wasn't I great?

49
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:15,872
We get it now. Now, can we watch something else?

50
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:17,207
I'm sick and tired of watching that.

51
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,475
You're sick and tired of it?

52
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:22,812
- You jerk. - Gosh.

53
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:26,716
You're making a fuss over a supporting role.

54
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,752
I'm sure you'll get worse when you play a leading role.

55
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,188
What? You jerk.

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,292
By the way, why do they want you to be in their commercial?

57
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,762
I thought only top stars shoot coffee commercials.

58
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:39,863
Do they want to go bankrupt?

59
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:41,231
Gosh.

60
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,867
What? You jerk.

61
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:47,370
Stop it now, okay?

62
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,372
I'm going to the meeting.

63
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:52,275
Hold on. Can I use your car today?

64
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:53,810
Do you mean Rebecca?

65
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,078
Why? For what reason?

66
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:57,814
Without a car, it's too inconvenient to pick up clothes.

67
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:58,848
And taxis are expensive.

68
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:00,550
So I want to practice driving.

69
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,252
Is your car in a good condition?

70
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:03,486
Of course.

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,789
Rebecca is so sturdy.

72
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:09,359
But don't try to open the right window.

73
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,527
Why?

74
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:16,466
It's a sad story.

75
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,969
Please be easy on Rebecca.

76
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:22,705
- Okay. - You better use another car.

77
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:23,940
Don't worry.

78
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,509
But isn't it expensive to hire an instructor?

79
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:29,479
It's no problem. Du Shik will help me.

80
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,547
What? Me?

81
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:32,282
When? Where? What? How? Why?

82
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:33,716
Just follow me, Director Bong.

83
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:35,985
Hold on. I'm not even wearing socks. Just look at this.

84
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:38,621
Don't worry. You'll be sitting in the car anyway.

85
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,390
- See you later. - Hey.

86
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,591
- Hey. - Du Shik, it's dangerous.

87
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:42,826
- Dong Gu. - See you.

88
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:43,860
- Be careful. - Okay.

89
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,029
- Hey. - Rebecca is pretty rough.

90
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,865
I'll get going then.

91
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,634
I'm heading out too. Wait for me.

92
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:52,802
Okay.

93
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,705
Seo Jin, stop.

94
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,741
Didn't I tell you to keep a 5m distance from him?

95
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:01,478
You can leave five minutes after Jun Ki.

96
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:02,679
What?

97
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:04,881
When are you going to stop doing this?

98
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:08,618
Well, that would be when I don't have to suspect you two anymore.

99
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:11,254
Sit down, please.

100
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:13,323
- Gosh. - What?

101
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:15,959
Then I'll get going now.

102
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,460
Okay. Go ahead.

103
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:25,001
Gosh. You're bossing me around.

104
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:26,836
This is so annoying.

105
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,138
What? Do you have...

106
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:31,207
something else to do?

107
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:35,345
- No. - You have nothing to do anyway.

108
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:39,682
Can you drive?

109
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:42,519
Of course. I got my license eight years ago.

110
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,187
I haven't driven since then though.

111
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:46,856
What? Never?

112
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:48,858
It'll be fine.

113
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:51,227
I'll get the hang of it soon.

114
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:53,296
All right. Let's go.

115
00:04:54,931 --> 00:04:56,332
This is annoying.

116
00:04:56,933 --> 00:05:00,169
Du Shik, which pedal is for the brakes?

117
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,604
Is it the left pedal or right pedal?

118
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:02,639
What?

119
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,874
You want to drive a car without even knowing that?

120
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:08,444
It's been a while, so I'm a bit confused.

121
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,980
This doesn't feel right.

122
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,751
What is this?

123
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:20,723
It won't open.

124
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:22,492
You have to open that door from the outside.

125
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,861
Nothing in this car works.

126
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:26,029
Hold on.

127
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,631
What are you doing?

128
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:31,367
My gosh. Seriously.

129
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:44,614
Director Bong, what are you doing? Let's go.

130
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,516
All right. Just a second.

131
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:54,123
All right. Here we go.

132
00:05:59,996 --> 00:06:02,298
Gosh. What are you doing, you idiot?

133
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,300
What? "Idiot"? Are you serious?

134
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,435
I take it back.

135
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,003
Here we go then.

136
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:08,137
(Can't tell the brake from the accelerator)

137
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:09,939
(Beginner driver, future murderer)

138
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:16,813
Hey, slow down.

139
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:25,021
You jerk!

140
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:26,489
Gosh, stop it.

141
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:28,925
Seo Jin, it's me.

142
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,159
Jun Ki?

143
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,495
What was that? You scared me.

144
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:33,763
Are you okay?

145
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:36,799
Are you sure you're not being followed?

146
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,034
I'm talking about Dong Gu.

147
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,569
What are you talking about?

148
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,270
Dong Gu has other things to do.

149
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,839
Didn't you see his eyes?

150
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,540
He looked like the Grim Reaper.

151
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,342
We better be careful.

152
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:47,510
My goodness.

153
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:49,979
Are we shooting a spy movie or what?

154
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,748
There's nothing wrong with being careful.

155
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:55,018
Then should we grab some coffee?

156
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:57,754
Don't you have a meeting this morning?

157
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:00,223
But I have time for a cup of coffee with you.

158
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:01,591
Don't worry.

159
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:05,728
I hope you'll get the commercial contract.

160
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:09,632
Don't worry. It's almost decided.

161
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:10,633
Really?

162
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:13,836
Have you told your father yet? He'd be so happy.

163
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:16,839
Yes. He feels proud of me.

164
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,175
He complimented me for the first time...

165
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:21,277
in the 31 years of my life.

166
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:25,114
Oh, I'm so proud of my boyfriend.

167
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,225
Darn it. I lost her.

168
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:38,628
Did she figure out I was following her?

169
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:41,164
Seo Jin. Jun Ki.

170
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll catch you guys some day.

171
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,035
When I do,

172
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:50,973
you will no longer be alive.

173
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:00,583
There are not many cars...

174
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,919
or people on this road. It's perfect for practice.

175
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,054
But driving isn't that difficult.

176
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:08,291
Oh, I forgot the most important thing.

177
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,361
Hey, are you crazy?

178
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,464
Why would you take your hands off the wheel?

179
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:17,300
You got it. What's the problem?

180
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:22,405
You should put on sunglasses when you drive.

181
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:23,573
What are you talking about?

182
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:25,108
Put your hands back on the wheel.

183
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:27,343
This is not a self-driving car, you psycho.

184
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:29,645
- What? - I take it back. Hold the wheel.

185
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:32,248
Give me a second. Let me look in the mirror.

186
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:34,484
I can't believe you.

187
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:36,886
Gosh.

188
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,958
I don't know what I'm doing.

189
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:44,560
Is it funny?

190
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,234
Dong Gu, what are you doing?

191
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:52,902
Why are you scooping out the bread?

192
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:54,203
Oh, this?

193
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:57,406
I need to check if an air rifle fits inside this bread.

194
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,409
An air rifle inside the bread?

195
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,779
Our main character is a spy.

196
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:04,781
And they want to put a rifle inside the bread.

197
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:06,749
- Why? - I don't know.

198
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:09,719
They say it was my idea, but I don't remember anything.

199
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:12,488
Anyway, they want me to put an air rifle inside this bread.

200
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:14,357
I don't know what I'm doing.

201
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,927
- Where are you going? - I'm going to the studio.

202
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,162
Again?

203
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,464
Don't you think you're going there too often?

204
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,432
There's a lot to do around here.

205
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,701
I'm done with everything.

206
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,203
Are you sure?

207
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,905
I looked around yesterday,

208
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:30,940
and there were many things to repair.

209
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,642
Like what? Where?

210
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:34,110
Well,

211
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,311
the dormitory room on the second floor...

212
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,713
Do you mean the slightly loose doorknob?

213
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:40,216
I bought a new one and replaced it this morning.

214
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:41,984
Really?

215
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:43,920
The single room on the second floor...

216
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,689
The light that flickers every 4.2 seconds?

217
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:48,591
I went up there by a ladder...

218
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:51,093
and fixed all short circuits yesterday.

219
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:53,262
Oh, right. On the third floor...

220
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:55,665
Do you mean the third stair that was a bit unstable?

221
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:58,968
I bought a welding machine and fixed it this morning.

222
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,137
You can go then.

223
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:04,106
Okay. See you, Sol.

224
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,575
Please take care of Sol.

225
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:06,709
Bye.

226
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:08,611
Okay. Bye.

227
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,580
What was that?

228
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:12,248
Sol.

229
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:14,350
Your mom can even weld now.

230
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,385
She's like an engineer.

231
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:20,656
I don't want her to spend too much time with Hyun Joon.

232
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,158
Gosh, whatever.

233
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,862
Why are they putting an air rifle in the bread?

234
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,064
What kind of movie is this?

235
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,933
I'm sorry, Jun Ki.

236
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:34,070
The advertiser suddenly recommended Jae Hyun.

237
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,771
I'm sorry, Jun Ki.

238
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:37,240
I didn't want to do it,

239
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,141
but my agency pressured me.

240
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:42,178
Don't worry. I'm fine.

241
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:43,412
Still,

242
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:46,282
I don't want to look like I'm taking your contract away.

243
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:47,917
This is not right.

244
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:52,889
By the way, do you know why they recommended me?

245
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,090
Well,

246
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,660
your smile is most important in this advertisement.

247
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:00,730
Some people were not completely satisfied...

248
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,932
with Jun Ki's smile.

249
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,200
But...

250
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,702
what kind of smile do they want?

251
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:09,538
A smile as fresh as...

252
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,040
morning dew.

253
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:15,745
"A smile as fresh as morning dew"?

254
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:17,947
Let's eat first.

255
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,115
Sure.

256
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,787
- Jae Hyun. - Are you okay?

257
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:27,490
I'm okay.

258
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:31,093
Wait. Why is he suddenly smiling?

259
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,229
You fell pretty hard.

260
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:37,266
It hurts a bit. But I'm...

261
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:39,635
really okay.

262
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,639
Wait. He's smiling again.

263
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:46,142
Is he showing off his smile?

264
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:49,979
Now, I feel...

265
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,747
a lot better now.

266
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,118
He is.

267
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:58,187
What if I lose my contract to him?

268
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,923
Then should we go eat now?

269
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,124
Sure.

270
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,696
My phone is ringing. Just a second.

271
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,698
Hello.

272
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:12,435
What? Really?

273
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,670
How...

274
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:16,172
Okay.

275
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,308
What's the matter?

276
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:21,877
A friend of mine collapsed.

277
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,646
He's getting surgery right now.

278
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:26,015
He's like a brother to me.

279
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:27,850
His name is Kang Dong Gu.

280
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,019
You must be so worried.

281
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,287
It's okay.

282
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,456
I'm all right.

283
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,529
Okay. I'm sure everything will be all right.

284
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,498
- Stay strong, Jun Ki. - Okay.

285
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:45,701
I should stay positive in difficult situations.

286
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:47,703
I'm okay.

287
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:51,741
I see.

288
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:55,244
Then what shall we eat for lunch today?

289
00:12:57,346 --> 00:13:01,784
Tofu with kimchi or sandwich.

290
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,252
"Tofu with kimchi or sandwich"?

291
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,254
- How about you, Jun Ki? - I think...

292
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:07,690
tofu with kimchi...

293
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,693
or sandwich would be good,

294
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,496
but sushi is also good.

295
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,065
Hey.

296
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:18,100
Until when will you do that?

297
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,369
Why are you fixing your makeup while driving?

298
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:24,273
Can't you see the tan line from the sunglasses?

299
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:26,275
Be quiet, and grab the steering wheel.

300
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,778
Fine, I will. Goodness.

301
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:30,613
You're being annoying.

302
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:33,215
Hey, go slowly.

303
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:35,885
You're going too fast. Step on the brakes.

304
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,223
- What's this? - What?

305
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:43,526
Is this the brake pedal?

306
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:44,660
- Let me see. - Here you go.

307
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,263
- This is the brake pedal. - What?

308
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,998
Did the brake pedal just break now?

309
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:50,466
That's amazing.

310
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,535
It's not the time to be impressed.

311
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:55,337
Goodness, what's wrong with this?

312
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,541
- How did the brakes... - What do I do?

313
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,509
What do I do now, Du Shik?

314
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,545
Take your foot off the accelerator.

315
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:05,281
- Then the car will slow down. - Okay.

316
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:08,250
I took off my foot, but it's not slowing down.

317
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,753
What should I do, Du Shik?

318
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,489
My goodness, we might get in a car accident.

319
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,858
The hand brakes. The hand brakes!

320
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,861
What's going on?

321
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,330
What kind of car is this?

322
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:24,700
Du Shik, what should we do?

323
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,636
We have no choice. Let's report it.

324
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:28,871
Let's call 911.

325
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:31,107
- Call 911. - Where's my cell phone?

326
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:32,675
Where is it? Wait.

327
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,448
Darn it.

328
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:42,651
I left my cell phone on top of the car.

329
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:44,286
Soo Ah, give me your phone.

330
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:46,489
- Give me your cell phone. - My cell phone?

331
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:50,526
Where's my cell phone?

332
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,134
Gosh, I left it at home.

333
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,502
Seriously.

334
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:02,338
Then we have no choice.

335
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:05,441
What are you doing?

336
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:07,676
Jun Ki told us not to open that window.

337
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:09,311
It has a sad legend.

338
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,714
What else can I do? My cell phone is on top.

339
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:16,318
What is this? Why doesn't this window open?

340
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:19,488
Goodness. Jun Ki, that jerk.

341
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:21,690
This is such a mess.

342
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,266
I think I might reach it.

343
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,869
Hey, why are you raising the window?

344
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:34,970
I didn't.

345
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,073
It hurts. Lower the window.

346
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:40,075
- Okay. - My arm might get cut off.

347
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:41,710
- It's cold outside. - What?

348
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,145
- It doesn't work either. - What?

349
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:45,014
What kind of car is this?

350
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,582
Hey, Soo Ah.

351
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:48,784
What should we do? There's a big street.

352
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:50,119
A big street?

353
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,821
Turn left. Go to the construction site.

354
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:56,025
- Go to the construction site. - Okay.

355
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,927
Hey, go slowly.

356
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,562
Go in straight.

357
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:02,565
- How? - Go toward the side.

358
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:04,667
Why did you crash into that? What's happening now.

359
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,036
What should I do now, Du Shik?

360
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:10,105
Turn the car over there.

361
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:11,974
Keep turning.

362
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:13,242
What? Keep turning?

363
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:15,878
What else can we do? We might get into an accident if we go out.

364
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:18,380
Why did you suggest practicing your driving skills?

365
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,583
I didn't know this would happen.

366
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,319
(Room D)

367
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:30,159
Jun Ki, try some of this.

368
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,865
Oh, thank you.

369
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:39,535
It's nice to see you like that.

370
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:41,103
Are you quite close?

371
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:44,306
Of course. We're as close as brothers.

372
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:48,644
But sir,

373
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:51,580
is the concept for the commercial finished?

374
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,982
Of course.

375
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,918
The most important thing about this commercial...

376
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:58,387
is your smile as I mentioned before.

377
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,322
Next, is your facial expression.

378
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:03,559
Your facial expression must be as rich as...

379
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,527
a rainbow.

380
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,231
A facial expression...

381
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,734
- as rich as a rainbow? - That's right.

382
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,602
- Let's eat up. - Sure.

383
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,544
Gosh, it's so sour.

384
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:24,146
It's sour.

385
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,148
- Is the kimchi that sour? - Yes.

386
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:30,853
- It's like chewing on sour lemon. - Lemon?

387
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:32,821
- It's sour. - I should drink some water.

388
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,093
Gosh, it's so cold.

389
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,063
- It's really cold. - Here he goes again.

390
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,999
Fine. Bring it on.

391
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:47,870
The chili looks delicious.

392
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:56,445
It feels like my mouth is burning.

393
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,514
It's spicy.

394
00:17:58,614 --> 00:17:59,915
I want dongchimi.

395
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,787
It's sweet and sour.

396
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:09,425
It's so sour, yet sweet.

397
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:10,993
It's flavorful.

398
00:18:10,993 --> 00:18:12,394
It's sweet and sour.

399
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,170
Until when do we have to do this?

400
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:23,505
I don't know either.

401
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:27,343
You should keep driving until the car runs out of gas.

402
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:31,347
There's no one passing by.

403
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:36,318
Why do I feel so gassy?

404
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:38,854
Did I eat too much pizza earlier?

405
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:41,824
I'm about to fart. What should I do?

406
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:47,629
You startled me.

407
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,798
Why did you honk all of a sudden?

408
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,967
What? There was a cat.

409
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,936
A cat? I don't see any cats.

410
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:56,772
What's this smell?

411
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,974
Is there a sewer nearby?

412
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:03,412
Soo Ah.

413
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:05,314
Did you fart?

414
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:07,516
Is that why you honked?

415
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:08,884
No way.

416
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:10,686
I honked because there was a cat.

417
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,054
Stop kidding.

418
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:13,589
It isn't just the noise.

419
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,424
What will you do about the smell?

420
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:17,226
Fine, I farted.

421
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,461
But you seriously have no manners.

422
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:21,897
You should pretend not to know when a lady farts.

423
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:23,832
Did you have to say it?

424
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,169
They say that those who fart get angry. It's exactly right.

425
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,406
Forget it. That's why you've never dated until now.

426
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,675
What? Why do you make fun of my weakness?

427
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:35,577
Forget it. I won't talk to you anymore.

428
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,848
You startled me. What?

429
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:43,185
- Did you fart again? - No, I honked because of a cat.

430
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:44,853
Gosh, it smells.

431
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,488
What did you eat?

432
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:48,690
I honked because of a cat.

433
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,992
Stop farting.

434
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:52,394
I'm not honking because I farted.

435
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:53,662
Anyway, sir,

436
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,266
is there any other important factor...

437
00:19:57,466 --> 00:19:59,368
other than rich facial expressions?

438
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:00,702
Another factor?

439
00:20:02,104 --> 00:20:03,906
Your voice is important too.

440
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,741
How shall I put it?

441
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:10,078
It's a sweet voice like coffee powder...

442
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,014
melting in hot water.

443
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,450
Something like the voice of Gong Yoo or Sung Si Kyung...

444
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,151
from "Goblin".

445
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:17,753
Gong Yoo or Sung Si Kyung?

446
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,424
You're out of soup, Director.

447
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,594
- Excuse me, ma'am. - Yes?

448
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:26,995
Yes?

449
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:31,099
It tastes delicious and seasoned right.

450
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,036
As we enjoyed the soup,

451
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:36,138
we order one more bean paste soup.

452
00:20:36,371 --> 00:20:38,173
- Pardon? - Also,

453
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,710
the texture is good.

454
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,012
It's simmered the right amount.

455
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,015
As we enjoyed rice,

456
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,985
we order one more bowl of rice.

457
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:54,690
Okay, another doenjang soup and rice at table three.

458
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,826
Why am I getting a call?

459
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:00,796
Pardon me for being on the phone.

460
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:03,732
Hello?

461
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,067
What?

462
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:08,704
Right now? I can't right now.

463
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:10,939
It can't be helped.

464
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:15,210
It would be nice

465
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:20,015
While holding your hand tightly

466
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:24,386
I wish I could walk on this street

467
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:27,456
Jun Ki, why are you singing all of a sudden?

468
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:33,095
Do you remember my friend, Kang Dong Gu?

469
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:35,397
He's in surgery right now.

470
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:37,666
He wanted to hear me sing.

471
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,034
Then you should sing.

472
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:41,603
Thank you for understanding. I'll finish it.

473
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:46,208
It would be nice

474
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:51,179
While holding your hand tightly

475
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,784
I wish I could walk on this street

476
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:58,787
You are the only one for me

477
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:03,258
I'm tired.

478
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,928
How long have we been driving?

479
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:07,863
Is it because of the pizza that I had?

480
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:09,431
I'm getting a stomachache.

481
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:11,433
I'm about to lose it.

482
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:13,235
My stomach hurts.

483
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:15,904
My endless farting doesn't seem normal.

484
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:22,945
Hey, aren't you being too harsh?

485
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:24,179
What did I do?

486
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,814
It's because there was a cat.

487
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:28,083
Stop talking about cats.

488
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,651
You aren't the only one with a stomachache.

489
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:30,786
I have a stomachache too.

490
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:33,055
If I relax just a little bit,

491
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:35,657
I'm in the verge of causing a disaster.

492
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:39,561
But I'm controlling myself because I still have a sense of decency.

493
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:41,496
Never mind. I refuse to speak to you any longer.

494
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:42,931
Don't you dare speak to me.

495
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:50,105
Why don't you just do it? Just go ahead, and do it.

496
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:12,995
What are you looking at? I can't concentrate.

497
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:15,397
Well, you looked so happy.

498
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:17,466
You really look happy when you bake bread.

499
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:19,234
- Do I? - Yes.

500
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:23,338
Hyun Joon. Was becoming a patisseur your childhood dream?

501
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:25,507
Yes. Ever since I was a child,

502
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,342
I loved bread.

503
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:30,646
So I spent too much money on bread.

504
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:32,080
I thought it wasn't right.

505
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,449
I figured I should start baking bread myself.

506
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:37,019
It all started from there, and here I am today.

507
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:39,154
Stop joking around.

508
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:41,590
Yoon Ah. What about you?

509
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:43,525
Did you dream of becoming a patisseur as well?

510
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:46,928
No. I had another dream.

511
00:23:47,162 --> 00:23:48,764
I've given up that dream now though.

512
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,066
Is that right? What was it?

513
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:52,934
A rapper.

514
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:54,703
"A rapper"?

515
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:58,707
I honestly think my rap has a competitive edge,

516
00:23:58,874 --> 00:24:01,276
but apparently, people don't get my swag.

517
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:03,145
You wanted to be a rapper?

518
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:05,013
I wonder how that would be.

519
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:08,383
Really? Then would you like to hear me rap?

520
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:10,018
Sure. It would be an honor.

521
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:13,955
Then I'll do an impromptu rap about you.

522
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,291
Yeah

523
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:20,128
Get it This is a song about

524
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:22,330
the boy that loved bread

525
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,032
Hyun Joon

526
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:27,035
Hyun Joon likes bread, right? It's delicious, right?

527
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:30,238
Baguette, croissant Sausage rolls, vegetable rolls

528
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:32,674
Red bean buns, cream buns

529
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:33,975
Bread, bread

530
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:36,912
Chew them well Yummy, yummy

531
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:43,919
(Garam red bean steamed bun)

532
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,089
Why is it taking them so long just to decide their model?

533
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:50,158
I have no intention of appearing in a commercial.

534
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:51,593
They're only wasting my time.

535
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:56,264
From the way I see it, the director...

536
00:24:56,264 --> 00:24:58,033
really seemed to like you.

537
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,236
Jun Ki. Make sure you treat me to a meal if you get this job.

538
00:25:01,737 --> 00:25:02,904
All right.

539
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:08,710
(Dad)

540
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:13,115
Yes, Dad. What is it?

541
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:16,084
The commercial?

542
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:18,520
It hasn't been decided yet.

543
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,123
I'm waiting for the result.

544
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:24,025
There's no need to worry, CEO Park.

545
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:26,628
We decided to cast Jae Hyun just now.

546
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:28,463
One moment, Dad.

547
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:31,700
I assure you.

548
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,269
How could I possibly turn down your favor, CEO Park?

549
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,073
I convinced the director to cast Jae Hyun, so don't worry.

550
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:40,842
In return, you have to give me that bag you promised.

551
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:44,246
I'll send you a text message with the exact name of the model. Okay.

552
00:25:49,951 --> 00:25:51,086
Yes, Dad.

553
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,823
If you don't mind, can I call you back later?

554
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:56,758
All right.

555
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:06,201
Gosh. My stomach aches.

556
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:08,203
I can't even breathe now.

557
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:09,604
What if I really end up...

558
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:12,407
dumping my load in front of Soo Ah? I can't let that happen. My gosh.

559
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:15,177
Gosh. This is killing me.

560
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:17,679
I really think I've reached my limit.

561
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,448
Du Shik's with me. This is driving me crazy.

562
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:23,652
All right. I have no choice.

563
00:26:23,652 --> 00:26:25,220
I'll have to jump out.

564
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:26,755
Du Shik.

565
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:31,092
If you don't mind, could you take over the steering wheel?

566
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:34,095
What? All right.

567
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:42,137
Soo Ah. Are you crazy? What are you doing?

568
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,207
Don't stop me. I think I'll die. My stomach hurts so bad.

569
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:46,541
So are you really jumping out?

570
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,043
You'll die if you jump out.

571
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:49,110
I don't care.

572
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,545
Whether I die by jumping out...

573
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:52,714
or die of shame after dumping my load in front of you,

574
00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:54,015
either way, I'll end up dying.

575
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:56,284
No. It'd be much better dying from jumping out of this car.

576
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:58,687
What are you saying? Get a hold of yourself.

577
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:02,290
Don't stop me. Don't try to stop me.

578
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:14,703
It stopped,

579
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,671
right?

580
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:20,642
It stopped. We'll live.

581
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:23,778
- We survived, Soo Ah. - Du Shik.

582
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:29,184
Get off me.

583
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:32,120
- Tissue. - What? Yes, tissue.

584
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:37,225
I found some. I found some.

585
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:38,426
I found some. I found some tissue.

586
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:41,062
Du Shik. Give me a sheet.

587
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:46,401
What? There's only one sheet?

588
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:53,575
Du Shik.

589
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:58,747
No. I can't give this up.

590
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,382
This...

591
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:03,385
is my last bastion of my human rights.

592
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:05,520
Forgive me, Soo Ah.

593
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:07,622
I knew it.

594
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:10,191
Even I wouldn't be able to give it away myself.

595
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:12,727
I understand.

596
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:16,898
You don't need to feel guilty.

597
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:19,801
I'll try to get through this somehow.

598
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,906
I'll just have to find some wastepaper somewhere.

599
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:26,441
Soo Ah.

600
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:37,085
- Du Shik. - Take it before I change my mind.

601
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:38,787
Hurry up.

602
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:48,096
What about you?

603
00:28:54,202 --> 00:28:55,770
It's already too late for me.

604
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:59,240
So hurry up, and go.

605
00:28:59,274 --> 00:29:01,076
And go somewhere far from here.

606
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:02,444
Go as far as you can.

607
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:14,689
Du Shik. I'm sorry,

608
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:17,258
but I have a favor to ask.

609
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:21,997
Soo Ah.

610
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:26,201
I can't believe you.

611
00:29:27,302 --> 00:29:30,472
You shouldn't be asking me to do this.

612
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:33,441
How could she ask me to do this?

613
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:37,879
Du Shik. It's time.

614
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:52,560
Does Yoon Ah know what time it is? Why isn't she home yet?

615
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:56,398
What on earth is she doing with Hyun Joon every day?

616
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,201
- Yoon Ah. You're home. - I'm home.

617
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:02,570
Dong Gu. How are you?

618
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:05,073
I'm not doing well.

619
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:09,544
Yoon Ah. Why are you home so late?

620
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:12,614
Do you know how much we have to do because you were gone?

621
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:15,550
I'm sorry. I didn't realize it had gotten so late.

622
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,619
Never mind. Go change your clothes,

623
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,788
and clean up the kitchen first.

624
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:20,922
All right.

625
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,024
Hyun Joon, I'll see you in class then.

626
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,660
Yoon Ah. Take this.

627
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,861
I almost forgot.

628
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,364
Thank you for the gift.

629
00:30:29,364 --> 00:30:32,500
Don't mention it. After all, I was able to hear your amazing rap.

630
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,935
I thought I should give you something in return.

631
00:30:34,202 --> 00:30:36,938
Thank you. I'll make good use of this mini oven.

632
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:38,273
I'll see you in class then.

633
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:47,882
- Then I'll get going now. - Wait. Wait right there.

634
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,252
Hyun Joon. You and I should talk.

635
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,288
What would you like to talk about?

636
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:55,890
If Yoon Ah comes home late,

637
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,893
it greatly affects our business.

638
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:02,163
So could you please have her come home early from now on?

639
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,933
She's my employee.

640
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,534
You have no sense of business ethics.

641
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:09,204
Are you that anxious?

642
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,206
What?

643
00:31:11,206 --> 00:31:12,874
That's how it looks to me.

644
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:15,477
I'm clearly at a disadvantage,

645
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:17,245
but seeing you being that anxious...

646
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:19,247
doesn't feel all that bad.

647
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:20,915
You should get some rest.

648
00:31:21,716 --> 00:31:24,819
Wait a minute. What is that supposed to mean?

649
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:27,222
We're not finished here. Where are you going?

650
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:30,458
What? Do I feel anxious?

651
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:34,262
Why would I be anxious?

652
00:31:35,096 --> 00:31:36,598
I don't feel anxious at all.

653
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,968
What kind of joke was that?

654
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:48,042
Jun Ki, you're home.

655
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,545
What happened to that commercial?

656
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:54,782
Of course, like always,

657
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:58,686
I failed the audition.

658
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:01,389
Why? You said it was almost confirmed.

659
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,324
It just turned out that way.

660
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:06,661
What is that supposed to mean? There's got to be a reason.

661
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:10,165
You see...

662
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:14,202
What? How could they do such a thing?

663
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:15,570
Seriously. Those jerks.

664
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:17,205
What can I do?

665
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:20,108
I should accept the fact since I don't have connections or money.

666
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:21,943
Cheer up, Jun Ki.

667
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:23,845
I'm sure another good opportunity will come your way.

668
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm all right.

669
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:28,283
I'll be all right about myself,

670
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,985
but I'm worried about disappointing my father.

671
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,289
He was so excited.

672
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,897
Have you been practicing driving until now?

673
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,768
But what happened to you?

674
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:48,970
Isn't that Soo Ah's dress?

675
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,838
Why are you wearing it?

676
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:52,373
That's right.

677
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,942
Where did your pants go?

678
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:57,145
What did you do outside?

679
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:58,646
Don't ask us anything.

680
00:32:59,013 --> 00:33:00,782
Don't ask us...

681
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:02,750
anything at all.

682
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:08,990
Soo Ah.

683
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:11,626
I'll return this dress...

684
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,362
after washing it tomorrow.

685
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,433
No. Keep it.

686
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,569
I couldn't wear it again.

687
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:23,638
You can keep it.

688
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:28,409
I'm going to bed now.

689
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:35,750
Jun Ki.

690
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:40,922
Why don't you just scrap Rebecca?

691
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,558
What are you talking about?

692
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:45,193
Why would I?

693
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:46,928
Don't ask me why.

694
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:49,364
Just do it.

695
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:52,333
It's for your own sake.

696
00:33:57,005 --> 00:33:58,840
Hey.

697
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:01,576
What are you talking about while dressed like a shaman?

698
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:08,616
Cheer up.

699
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:10,852
You'll get another commercial contract soon.

700
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,553
That's right.

701
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:15,189
Try this bread.

702
00:34:15,189 --> 00:34:16,791
You didn't have any breakfast.

703
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:20,094
I'm okay. I don't have much of an appetite.

704
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:25,800
Wait. Isn't that the commercial you were going to shoot?

705
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:31,739
That's right. Colombia Espresso.

706
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,374
- Right? - I don't care.

707
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:35,376
I don't want to see it.

708
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:37,145
I need some rest.

709
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,215
- Wait. What's that? - It's morning in Colombia.

710
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:44,452
Coffee beans wake up with a smile...

711
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:46,788
as fresh as morning dew.

712
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:53,461
Emma roasts freshly-picked coffee beans every morning.

713
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:58,132
It brings out flavors...

714
00:34:58,132 --> 00:35:00,868
as rich as the colors of the rainbow.

715
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,838
Coffee powder melts with a sound...

716
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,741
as soft as spring sunshine.

717
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:11,179
Enjoy a cup of coffee every morning.

718
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:13,815
Colombia Espresso.

719
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:16,584
What's that? It's so tacky.

720
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:18,186
- What was that? - Exactly.

721
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,854
It's so embarrassing.

722
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:21,956
It's a good thing that you didn't do it.

723
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:23,725
What's that?

724
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:26,694
He played such dirty tricks...

725
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:29,130
- to shoot that commercial? - Exactly.

726
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,832
It's so humiliating.

727
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:33,534
Why? It's the handsomest coffee bean I've ever seen.

728
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,370
He has a smile as fresh as morning dew,

729
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,305
facial expressions as rich as the colors of the rainbow,

730
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:40,408
and a voice as soft as morning sunshine.

731
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:43,044
You're finally laughing.

732
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:45,279
- Are you happy? - Yes, I am.

733
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:48,349
My appetite is suddenly back.

734
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:50,785
It tastes great.

735
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:53,054
It melts in your mouth.

736
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:56,023
My goodness.

737
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,093
Here. Eat a lot.

738
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:01,028
It just melts in your mouth.

739
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:27,422
Hey, what are you doing?

740
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:33,361
It's the 49th day since Olivia died.

741
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,431
Poor Olivia.

742
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:39,367
I hope her suffering has stopped.

743
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:41,869
Dong Gu.

744
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:45,573
You know you're as crazy as I am, right?

745
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,008
How can you say that?

746
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:49,644
You're the one who killed Olivia.

747
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:52,713
I'll buy you a better one when I get paid.

748
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:53,915
When?

749
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:56,050
When will you get paid?

750
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,220
I want to shoot movies, and I don't even have a camera.

751
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:03,257
If I had even a cheap camera, I'll be able to forget about Olivia.

752
00:37:03,424 --> 00:37:05,960
It's not like this service will bring her back.

753
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,663
That's not why I'm doing it.

754
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:10,731
Jun Ki, I came up with something amazing.

755
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:12,633
- It's incredible. - Something amazing?

756
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,969
- What is it? - Do you want to see? Come.

757
00:37:15,036 --> 00:37:16,537
- What is it? - Be quiet!

758
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:17,972
I'm holding a memorial service.

759
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:24,045
(Lee Jun Ki)

760
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:26,781
(Bong Du Shik)

761
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:37,692
Ready.

762
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:41,796
Go!

763
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:47,935
Go, go, go!

764
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,670
Go! Okay!

765
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,305
3.8 seconds.

766
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,574
Incredible. It's a new record.

767
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:58,112
Move. Let me try. It's my turn.

768
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:12,126
Here we go.

769
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,394
Ready.

770
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:15,329
- Go! - Here I go.

771
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,232
Go, go, go!

772
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:24,839
What are you doing right now?

773
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:32,179
Is it skeleton this time?

774
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,651
It's not exactly skeleton. It's something similar.

775
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:38,519
- Du Shik came up with... - Cut it out!

776
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:40,788
Don't you realize how childish this is?

777
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:42,957
- How old are you? - 31.

778
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,059
You're not a kid. What are you doing now?

779
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:48,296
I'm sorry.

780
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:53,701
Jun Ki, you didn't forget we're meeting my friend today, did you?

781
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,470
- Is it today? - You forgot?

782
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:58,439
Hurry up, and get ready.

783
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,575
Okay.

784
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:10,952
(No Matter How Much I Think about It)

785
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:14,322
What do you think?

786
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:16,057
I've been here recently,

787
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:18,225
and I thought the food tasted pretty good.

788
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:19,860
I love it.

789
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:23,030
- Thank you for bringing us here. - Don't mention it.

790
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:27,301
Seo Jin has been bragging so much about her boyfriend.

791
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:29,637
You're just as handsome as I imagined.

792
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:31,205
Thank you.

793
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:34,275
I get that a lot.

794
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,278
You're funny too.

795
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:38,879
Hey, you're lucky.

796
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:40,381
I guess so.

797
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:44,285
Right. Ji Young's boyfriend is a potter.

798
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:45,586
"A potter"?

799
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:47,888
So you're an artist.

800
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,291
Please come by studio sometime.

801
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,259
- Let me show you around. - Sure.

802
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:54,595
That'd be great.

803
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:56,464
I heard you're an actor.

804
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,799
You're appearing in "Newsroom" these days, right?

805
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:00,267
Yes.

806
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,938
What other shows have you been in?

807
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,907
Well, do you recognize this one?

808
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:10,344
- Octopus ink... - Octopus ink...

809
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,246
- gun! - gun!

810
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,885
Oh, that's a children's show.

811
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:19,587
You were so funny in that one.

812
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,389
No, I wasn't.

813
00:40:21,555 --> 00:40:23,758
I'm not that funny.

814
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:25,092
You got me wrong.

815
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:30,264
That's hilarious.

816
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:33,734
Do you want to see another one?

817
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:42,243
That's so funny.

818
00:40:44,445 --> 00:40:47,114
Seo Jin, why are you being like that?

819
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:49,116
Did I do something wrong?

820
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:51,052
Do you have to ask?

821
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:52,753
What did I do?

822
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,455
What's the matter with you?

823
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:57,425
Why would you do such silly things in front of my friend?

824
00:40:57,425 --> 00:41:00,594
It was a bit awkward, so I wanted to brighten up the mood.

825
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:02,763
Why do you have to do that?

826
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,265
Are you a clown?

827
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:06,567
Why are you never serious?

828
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,302
Can't you act like a grown-up?

829
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,538
I'm sorry.

830
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:12,606
I'll be careful from now on.

831
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:13,908
That's not enough.

832
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:15,910
Just stop it altogether.

833
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,446
Stop it altogether?

834
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,915
Well, I'm not sure...

835
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:24,752
I'll do it just at home. How about that?

836
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,923
Fine. I'll stop.

837
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:32,393
I'll stop being silly. Are you happy now?

838
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:35,062
Are you sure?

839
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:36,497
Keep your promise.

840
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:39,166
I will.

841
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,137
That's my boy.

842
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:55,449
It fits.

843
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:59,253
Gosh, it really fits.

844
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,621
What is this?

845
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,490
Why are you coming in together?

846
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:06,327
We met in front of the house.

847
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:07,661
That's right.

848
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:10,431
- Are you sure? - Yes.

849
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,900
Jun Ki!

850
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:16,070
What took you so long? I've been waiting for you.

851
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,038
Let's play another game.

852
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:19,874
Another game?

853
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,375
That sounds like fun.

854
00:42:23,844 --> 00:42:25,112
My throat hurts.

855
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:32,853
Du Shik, I'm sorry,

856
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:35,122
but I don't think I can do it anymore.

857
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:37,458
What? Why?

858
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:40,995
Well, I'm not going to do things like that anymore.

859
00:42:42,096 --> 00:42:43,430
You can do it by yourself.

860
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,402
Jun Ki. Jun Ki.

861
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,771
What's wrong? Jun Ki.

862
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:52,006
Why?

863
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,986
Yoon Ah, you're still here.

864
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:08,923
Yes. I just wanted to finish these.

865
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:11,392
Really? By the way,

866
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:14,094
I wanted to give you something.

867
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:16,564
Here.

868
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:19,233
What's this?

869
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,402
This is the money you earned from selling your muffins.

870
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:22,770
It's not much though.

871
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:25,806
What are you doing? Take it.

872
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:30,010
I'm not sure if I can take this.

873
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,913
You earned it. It's yours.

874
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:34,682
Go on.

875
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,517
Gosh, my hands are falling off.

876
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:38,619
Look, the envelop is falling.

877
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:42,690
Thank you.

878
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:44,992
Thank you so much.

879
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:56,570
- Hey. - Let's just do one game.

880
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:03,777
I'm not going to.

881
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:05,279
Are you really going to act like this?

882
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:07,581
Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden?

883
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:10,651
I don't want to play games like that.

884
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:14,855
Gosh, you've changed.

885
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,169
- I'm home. - Hello.

886
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,105
What are those?

887
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:33,073
I got my first payment for my muffins,

888
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:35,876
so I bought a few things for you.

889
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:54,128
What do you think? Do you like them?

890
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:57,097
Of course. I like it.

891
00:44:57,097 --> 00:44:59,233
I'm going to wear this every day!

892
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:05,739
I really wanted to buy an elephant hat.

893
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,474
Thanks, Yoon Ah.

894
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:09,510
Yes.

895
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:13,047
I was looking for a mirror like this.

896
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:14,581
How did you know?

897
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:16,784
I really like this too.

898
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:18,652
But what is this?

899
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:20,854
What do I use it for? Blushers?

900
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:24,258
It's a shaving brush that is used for shaving.

901
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:26,126
Shaving brush?

902
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:28,796
It's made from badger's fur.

903
00:45:28,796 --> 00:45:31,065
I heard it works really well.

904
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:33,634
Really?

905
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:36,770
It makes me so happy to be able to shave...

906
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,205
with badger fur.

907
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,875
I knew you'd like it.

908
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:44,878
In fact, I'm really good at choosing presents.

909
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:50,784
By the way, is Dong Gu in his room?

910
00:45:50,784 --> 00:45:52,786
I have something for him too.

911
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:58,058
What do you think? Do you like it?

912
00:45:58,792 --> 00:45:59,927
What?

913
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:03,931
Of course. I really like chickens.

914
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,799
That's why I don't even eat chickens often.

915
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,303
I knew you'd like it.

916
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:12,139
Dong Gu, are you free tomorrow?

917
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:14,108
Me? Why do you ask?

918
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:17,177
I have so much to thank you for,

919
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:18,879
so I wanted to buy you a meal.

920
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,047
A meal?

921
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:23,450
No, you don't need to.

922
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:25,352
When, where, and at what time do you want to meet?

923
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:36,864
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

924
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:40,200
I look like an elementary school student.

925
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:45,406
But I had to wear this since it was a gift from Yoon Ah.

926
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:50,844
- Dong Gu. - Yoon Ah.

927
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:53,213
Sorry for being late.

928
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,785
You wore it today.

929
00:46:57,785 --> 00:47:00,921
Yes, I liked it so much that I had to wear it.

930
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:04,058
Then what should we eat?

931
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:05,359
Wait.

932
00:47:05,626 --> 00:47:08,996
It's strange. Why isn't he here yet?

933
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,665
What? Who's coming?

934
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:13,434
Yoon Ah.

935
00:47:14,468 --> 00:47:15,702
Hyun Joon.

936
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,514
Why are you...

937
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,083
Why are you here?

938
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,618
I was on my way to meet Dong Gu...

939
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:34,488
when Hyun Joon called me to have lunch with me.

940
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:35,689
So I thought it'd be a nice idea...

941
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,558
to have lunch together. Would that be okay?

942
00:47:37,558 --> 00:47:40,060
- Sure. - Well, sure.

943
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,663
Where did you get that shirt?

944
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,700
I liked it so much that I gave it to him as a gift too.

945
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,636
But I didn't know you'd wear it on the same day.

946
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,473
You must have really liked it.

947
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,110
Of course.

948
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,913
I like it so much.

949
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:01,849
Let's go eat.

950
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:03,050
- Okay. - Sure.

951
00:48:04,685 --> 00:48:06,653
Why did you wear that?

952
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:16,864
What are you doing?

953
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:19,500
We should have a talk.

954
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:21,001
Let me go.

955
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:26,440
Gosh, why did you have to hold me like that?

956
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,641
People are watching.

957
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:31,411
Why do you sit next to Yoon Ah?

958
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:33,147
I just sat there.

959
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:35,215
One of us has to sit there.

960
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:38,118
Why does it have to be you?

961
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:39,686
What do you want me to do?

962
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:42,656
Hyun Joon, we're enemies,

963
00:48:42,656 --> 00:48:46,026
but let's play fair like men.

964
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:47,261
"Play fair"?

965
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:55,102
I'm buying today, so eat up.

966
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:56,570
- Thanks. - Thanks.

967
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:02,075
Someone's calling me.

968
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:04,745
Sorry, but I'll go outside and get this.

969
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:05,913
- What? - What?

970
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:09,650
This must look weird.

971
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:18,492
Gosh.

972
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:23,263
Can't you sit away from me?

973
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,731
It's cramped here.

974
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:26,733
Do your best.

975
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,439
When I created this, I was inspired by...

976
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:35,342
- the famous potter, Peter Voulkos. - Really?

977
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:39,346
I wanted to make a Korean version of his abstract pottery.

978
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:41,148
I see.

979
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:44,284
- Do you want to see that one too? - Sure.

980
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:46,053
Seo Jin.

981
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,523
I don't know, I can't know

982
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:50,891
Doesn't this remind you of Uhm Jeong Hwa?

983
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:52,226
- Put them down. - Yes, ma'am.

984
00:49:53,727 --> 00:49:55,395
I told you to stop joking around.

985
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,931
I'm sorry.

986
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:30,564
What are you doing? Why are you doing this alone?

987
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,368
It's nothing.

988
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:37,104
It's lonely to play alone.

989
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,674
I want to play.

990
00:50:42,576 --> 00:50:44,244
Maybe I could play with you.

991
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:46,580
Really?

992
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:04,931
What do you think? I'm great, right? Shall I do it again?

993
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:08,001
No, it's fine. Let's stop here.

994
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:10,470
It's not fun playing with you.

995
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,306
What? Why not?

996
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:15,509
You don't have the fun in you...

997
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,679
that Jun Ki has.

998
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:20,947
What? "Fun"?

999
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:23,450
Why do you need fun when you are doing this weird game?

1000
00:51:23,617 --> 00:51:25,852
What? "Weird game"?

1001
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:27,454
Is that what you think?

1002
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:30,724
What?

1003
00:51:31,224 --> 00:51:32,459
Forget it.

1004
00:51:32,693 --> 00:51:34,461
That's why you are impossible.

1005
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:38,565
What? Seriously.

1006
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:42,035
I was playing with him only because he was bored.

1007
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,810
Did you like the food?

1008
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,346
Yes, it was very delicious.

1009
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:54,448
It'd been better without someone.

1010
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,019
It was delicious.

1011
00:51:59,252 --> 00:52:01,288
I feel the same way.

1012
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:06,193
There's a bike.

1013
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,029
That looks fun.

1014
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:11,398
Do you want to ride a bike, Yoon Ah?

1015
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:14,000
Watching other people riding bikes makes me want to ride one too.

1016
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,769
- Then... - Let's go biking then.

1017
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:17,604
I'll rent them.

1018
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:29,883
Here you go, Hyun Joon.

1019
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,352
- Let's go, Yoon Ah. - Okay.

1020
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:40,394
Why am I riding a one-person bike?

1021
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,930
That was the only one left. What else could I do?

1022
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:48,001
Are you saying that you'll ride the two-person bike with Yoon Ah?

1023
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,070
- That's right. - You said that...

1024
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,338
we should play fair like men.

1025
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,440
What do you want to do then?

1026
00:52:58,445 --> 00:53:00,680
Was this necessary?

1027
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:06,453
You're the one who suggested a fair play.

1028
00:53:06,686 --> 00:53:07,854
Forget it.

1029
00:53:07,854 --> 00:53:09,923
Just step on the pedals.

1030
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:15,996
This is embarrassing.

1031
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:21,435
What are you doing?

1032
00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:24,070
Why are you putting your head behind my back?

1033
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:27,240
- Let's just go. - People will misunderstand.

1034
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,708
You're a strange man.

1035
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,710
- Goodness. - Just go.

1036
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,217
Thank you for inviting us today.

1037
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:38,452
It was so much fun.

1038
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:40,821
I'll invite you to the next exhibition, so please come.

1039
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:42,389
Of course I'll come.

1040
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,690
Just give us a call.

1041
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,293
How is working as a reporter?

1042
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,128
It's busy.

1043
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:50,964
I had no idea that being a reporter was so hard.

1044
00:53:51,431 --> 00:53:53,166
- Is it that hard? - Yes.

1045
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,735
By the way, how long have you two dated?

1046
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,585
Goodness.

1047
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:14,821
- What's wrong? - My tooth.

1048
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:16,289
What's wrong with your tooth?

1049
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,462
Did your tooth fall out?

1050
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:28,101
It's not a tooth

1051
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:31,471
It's a pine nut, a pine nut

1052
00:54:32,706 --> 00:54:34,040
What?

1053
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,677
- You startled me. - You're so funny, Jun Ki.

1054
00:54:37,944 --> 00:54:39,513
Isn't it funny?

1055
00:54:39,513 --> 00:54:41,548
It's not a tooth, it's a pine nut.

1056
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:42,916
Isn't it funny?

1057
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:45,051
Pine nut.

1058
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,622
What's wrong?

1059
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:50,190
Why are you laughing?

1060
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:56,029
It's nothing.

1061
00:54:56,563 --> 00:54:58,465
I feel loved.

1062
00:54:58,565 --> 00:55:00,834
I'm jealous, but I'm also loved.

1063
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:06,973
Gosh, it's refreshing.

1064
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:09,409
Isn't it great...

1065
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:11,778
to ride bikes and drink beer once in a while?

1066
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:13,079
Right.

1067
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:16,449
But it would've been better without someone.

1068
00:55:19,052 --> 00:55:20,720
Let's ride bikes and drink beer together...

1069
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,289
more often.

1070
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:23,690
Okay.

1071
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,493
Let it be just the two of us.

1072
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,896
I'm sorry, but I'll go use the restroom.

1073
00:55:29,996 --> 00:55:31,264
Go ahead.

1074
00:55:37,804 --> 00:55:41,575
Thank you for coming tonight.

1075
00:55:41,575 --> 00:55:43,910
Does everyone know...

1076
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:46,880
that today is our one-year anniversary of the store opening?

1077
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,181
- Yes. - Yes.

1078
00:55:48,582 --> 00:55:50,817
As I promised,

1079
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:53,520
we'll start a couple event...

1080
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,356
with amazing prizes on the line.

1081
00:55:57,591 --> 00:55:59,159
It's so loud.

1082
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:01,461
What kind of event is this at a bar?

1083
00:56:02,128 --> 00:56:04,998
I know. I just wanted to drink a beer in peace.

1084
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:07,200
The winner of today's...

1085
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,269
couple event...

1086
00:56:09,903 --> 00:56:14,140
receives a new DSLR camera.

1087
00:56:15,342 --> 00:56:18,345
The prize is a camera?

1088
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:22,782
Those who would like to participate, please come out.

1089
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,585
I must participate.

1090
00:56:25,685 --> 00:56:28,321
Why isn't Yoon Ah back yet?

1091
00:56:28,688 --> 00:56:31,825
Are you going to participate with Yoon Ah as a couple?

1092
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:35,428
Yes, I really need a camera.

1093
00:56:35,862 --> 00:56:37,230
But that's cheating.

1094
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,599
How dare you participate in a couple event with Yoon Ah?

1095
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,868
But this doesn't mean much.

1096
00:56:41,868 --> 00:56:43,470
It's because of the camera.

1097
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,105
Please understand me. Okay?

1098
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:49,376
We'll wait 30 more seconds before accepting the last participants.

1099
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:52,112
Gosh, Yoon Ah isn't back yet. What should I do?

1100
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:53,480
She won't come back.

1101
00:56:58,485 --> 00:56:59,753
Wait.

1102
00:57:00,186 --> 00:57:01,421
What?

1103
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:03,323
Why are you looking at me like that?

1104
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:06,860
Hyun Joon, can you participate in the couple event with me?

1105
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,495
What?

1106
00:57:08,495 --> 00:57:10,830
Are you insane? That's nonsense.

1107
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,899
Come on, Hyun Joon.

1108
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:14,434
We're rivals,

1109
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:17,270
but you can still participate in a couple event with me.

1110
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:21,708
That makes no sense.

1111
00:57:22,242 --> 00:57:24,411
I really need a camera.

1112
00:57:24,411 --> 00:57:26,513
I really need that camera, Hyun Joon.

1113
00:57:26,513 --> 00:57:27,881
Okay. 10.

1114
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:30,750
Nine.

1115
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:33,820
- It's still too... - Eight.

1116
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:35,789
Fine.

1117
00:57:35,955 --> 00:57:38,191
- Seven. - If we ride bikes again,

1118
00:57:39,092 --> 00:57:40,427
- Six. - I'll let you ride...

1119
00:57:40,427 --> 00:57:41,561
the two-person bike with Yoon Ah.

1120
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:45,031
- Really? Can I sit next to her too? - Five.

1121
00:57:45,031 --> 00:57:46,166
- What? - Four.

1122
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,601
- Aren't you being too greedy? - Forget it then.

1123
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:49,836
Three.

1124
00:57:50,103 --> 00:57:52,505
Fine, but it's canceled unless we win.

1125
00:57:52,505 --> 00:57:54,040
- Two. - I'm in.

1126
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,709
One.

1127
00:57:55,709 --> 00:57:57,010
- We're in! - We're in!

1128
00:57:57,644 --> 00:58:01,581
The team that lasts longer...

1129
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:05,051
will win the latest DSLR camera.

1130
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:06,386
Hold on.

1131
00:58:06,419 --> 00:58:07,654
Hold on.

1132
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:10,990
- Hyun Joon, are you okay? - Yes.

1133
00:58:11,057 --> 00:58:12,425
I'm okay.

1134
00:58:12,425 --> 00:58:14,828
I'll hold it even if I die.

1135
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:16,296
Keep going, Dong Gu.

1136
00:58:16,629 --> 00:58:17,664
Okay.

1137
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:19,799
I'll hold it even if my legs break.

1138
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:22,836
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1139
00:58:31,411 --> 00:58:33,747
- Let me pet your face. - Thank you.

1140
00:58:35,615 --> 00:58:37,717
- Let's win. - Come on.

1141
00:58:37,717 --> 00:58:40,487
- We can do it. - We can do it.

1142
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,357
Where is everyone?

1143
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:46,993
I'm hungry.

1144
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,995
Shall we make some ramyeon?

1145
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:50,930
I don't have an appetite.

1146
00:58:51,998 --> 00:58:53,533
I'll go and rest.

1147
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,535
Oh, okay.

1148
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:02,075
Jun Ki.

1149
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:06,980
Let's do it.

1150
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,822
(Bong Du Shik)

1151
00:59:48,822 --> 00:59:50,390
3.8 seconds.

1152
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,759
Incredible. It's a new record.

1153
00:59:53,626 --> 00:59:54,928
Five Sec.

1154
00:59:54,961 --> 00:59:57,430
- Five Sec, Five Sec - Five Sec, Five Sec

1155
00:59:57,564 --> 00:59:59,199
Shall I feed you, or will you take it?

1156
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:02,035
- Please kiss me. - My goodness.

1157
01:00:08,675 --> 01:00:10,543
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1158
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:13,746
What are we doing? When can we stop?

1159
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,648
It's okay. Don't cry.

1160
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:18,785
Why are you crying? Let's think positively.

1161
01:00:21,721 --> 01:00:22,956
This is amazing.

1162
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:25,124
My goodness.

1163
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:59,025
What's wrong with him?

1164
01:00:59,192 --> 01:01:02,295
Well, Dong Gu is completely worn out.

1165
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:03,529
"Worn out"?

1166
01:01:03,596 --> 01:01:05,164
What did he do?

1167
01:01:05,698 --> 01:01:07,500
It just happened.

1168
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:08,902
Yoon Ah,

1169
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:11,437
I'll help Dong Gu to his bed, okay?

1170
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:13,706
Sure, I'll get some water.

1171
01:01:13,706 --> 01:01:17,076
All right. Gosh.

1172
01:01:19,712 --> 01:01:21,281
Why is he so heavy?

1173
01:01:25,652 --> 01:01:27,787
Matilda.

1174
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:30,290
If you're Matilda, I'm Leon.

1175
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:34,827
What are you doing? Leave.

1176
01:01:34,928 --> 01:01:38,464
You can't do that.

1177
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:42,735
I carried you up here and helped you earn a camera.

1178
01:01:43,303 --> 01:01:46,706
The least you can do is thank me.

1179
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:49,542
Why should I thank you?

1180
01:01:49,642 --> 01:01:52,412
It was my first date with Yoon Ah,

1181
01:01:52,412 --> 01:01:55,615
but you ruined everything.

1182
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:57,317
It's the same for me too.

1183
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:00,920
You're unbelievable. Seriously.

1184
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,822
Tell me, Yoon Ah.

1185
01:02:02,822 --> 01:02:04,490
Tell me.

1186
01:02:05,024 --> 01:02:08,227
What is happening here?

1187
01:02:08,695 --> 01:02:10,897
They look like newlyweds.

1188
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:12,765
When did they get so close?

1189
01:02:18,471 --> 01:02:20,039
My gosh.

1190
01:02:21,808 --> 01:02:24,377
Where's Dong Gu? Isn't he awake yet?

1191
01:02:24,377 --> 01:02:27,213
No, Dong Gu and Hyun Joon are still asleep together.

1192
01:02:28,815 --> 01:02:30,917
They might even become best friends.

1193
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:33,186
I mean, that's impossible.

1194
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:35,755
Why not? What are you talking about?

1195
01:02:35,755 --> 01:02:38,191
What? It's nothing.

1196
01:02:39,892 --> 01:02:42,362
Jun Ki, you should eat. Take a seat.

1197
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:43,629
Sure.

1198
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:48,501
Du Shik.

1199
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:59,645
What's wrong with your face? Are you sick?

1200
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:00,880
You don't look so good.

1201
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,182
I agree. Is something wrong?

1202
01:03:04,183 --> 01:03:06,052
It's nothing. I'm fine.

1203
01:03:13,192 --> 01:03:14,861
Jun Ki, what's wrong?

1204
01:03:14,861 --> 01:03:16,396
Wake up!

1205
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,033
We took a test and found out...

1206
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:22,201
that his liver somatic index and blood pressure are high.

1207
01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:24,103
All test results are not good.

1208
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,539
But the strange part is that we can't find what caused this.

1209
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:29,509
What? What do you mean you can't find what caused this?

1210
01:03:29,509 --> 01:03:32,812
A person, who was perfectly healthy yesterday, can't get bad this fast.

1211
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:35,481
The only reason for this can be extreme stress.

1212
01:03:35,481 --> 01:03:37,383
Has he been...

1213
01:03:37,717 --> 01:03:40,686
- in tremendous shock lately? - Well,

1214
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:42,488
there's one thing I can think of.

1215
01:03:42,488 --> 01:03:43,556
What is it?

1216
01:03:43,556 --> 01:03:45,658
He really like to joke around,

1217
01:03:45,658 --> 01:03:47,226
but I told him not to.

1218
01:03:47,693 --> 01:03:50,797
He became really quiet from that moment...

1219
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:52,031
and lost all his energy.

1220
01:03:52,031 --> 01:03:54,267
That's where he got the shock. I'm sure of it.

1221
01:03:54,267 --> 01:03:55,368
What?

1222
01:03:55,368 --> 01:03:58,805
How can someone get sick from not being able to joke around?

1223
01:03:58,805 --> 01:04:00,706
It's not usual,

1224
01:04:00,706 --> 01:04:02,408
but that would be the only reason.

1225
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:04,710
Maybe to him, joking around...

1226
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,913
could have been everything to his life.

1227
01:04:06,913 --> 01:04:08,681
Everything to his life?

1228
01:04:09,115 --> 01:04:10,383
Joking around?

1229
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:16,589
Hello.

1230
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:22,428
What did he say? Am I really sick?

1231
01:04:22,428 --> 01:04:25,231
Yes, you might die.

1232
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:27,266
What?

1233
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,569
I can't be cured?

1234
01:04:30,103 --> 01:04:31,971
Won't surgeries work?

1235
01:04:31,971 --> 01:04:33,239
Well,

1236
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:35,341
you'll get better if you joke around again.

1237
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:36,576
What?

1238
01:04:37,076 --> 01:04:38,244
What are you talking about?

1239
01:04:38,244 --> 01:04:40,813
You're sick because I told you not to joke around.

1240
01:04:40,947 --> 01:04:44,750
So you can joke around as much as you want.

1241
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:47,620
Really? Can I?

1242
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,356
If not, you might die. What else could I do?

1243
01:04:50,756 --> 01:04:53,426
So do as you want.

1244
01:04:53,426 --> 01:04:54,660
Thank you!

1245
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:56,329
Thank you so much!

1246
01:04:56,562 --> 01:04:59,365
But there's one thing...

1247
01:04:59,365 --> 01:05:02,535
I've really wanted to try. Can I?

1248
01:05:02,535 --> 01:05:04,403
Go ahead. Go.

1249
01:05:04,403 --> 01:05:05,605
Yes!

1250
01:05:09,509 --> 01:05:10,877
Seo Jin, look!

1251
01:05:10,877 --> 01:05:12,411
It looks like I'm flying, right?

1252
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:16,682
Open up your wings

1253
01:05:19,652 --> 01:05:21,787
Seo Jin, try it on the other side.

1254
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,791
Look at me.

1255
01:05:33,232 --> 01:05:34,700
Try this.

1256
01:05:35,034 --> 01:05:37,270
You haven't eaten all day.

1257
01:05:37,403 --> 01:05:40,273
It's fine. I don't feel like eating.

1258
01:05:40,273 --> 01:05:43,376
What's wrong with you? Is something wrong?

1259
01:05:43,376 --> 01:05:44,544
I don't know.

1260
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:46,779
I feel weak.

1261
01:05:47,413 --> 01:05:48,981
I don't feel like eating either.

1262
01:05:51,217 --> 01:05:52,485
Du Shik!

1263
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:58,858
Jun Ki!

1264
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:02,328
Du Shik, I'm sorry for what I did.

1265
01:06:02,495 --> 01:06:04,230
You must have been angry at me.

1266
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:07,600
What is this? Are you back now?

1267
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,469
- Are you back to the Jun Ki I knew? - What?

1268
01:06:13,306 --> 01:06:14,574
Are you sure?

1269
01:06:15,308 --> 01:06:16,475
Are you sure?

1270
01:06:16,475 --> 01:06:18,077
Yes!

1271
01:06:18,411 --> 01:06:21,781
Du Shik, let's play the games we haven't been able to play...

1272
01:06:22,348 --> 01:06:23,783
these past few days.

1273
01:06:25,051 --> 01:06:26,886
Let's go!

1274
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:28,421
By the way,

1275
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:31,157
I upgraded our cart.

1276
01:06:32,058 --> 01:06:33,392
Do you want to try?

1277
01:06:35,094 --> 01:06:36,629
Let's go!

1278
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:38,464
Upgrade!

1279
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:41,234
- If it's with you... - If it's with you...

1280
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:43,836
Right, I've been meaning to give you this.

1281
01:06:50,142 --> 01:06:51,978
(Lee Jun Ki)

1282
01:06:52,612 --> 01:06:53,779
(Bong Du Shik)

1283
01:06:53,779 --> 01:06:55,881
(Lee Jun Ki, Bong Du Shik)

1284
01:06:57,516 --> 01:07:00,186
Let's go.

1285
01:07:00,853 --> 01:07:02,021
Ready.

1286
01:07:04,023 --> 01:07:05,191
Go!

1287
01:07:14,567 --> 01:07:16,402
Did you see how they all fell down?

1288
01:07:16,402 --> 01:07:18,471
It's called Cart Strike.

1289
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:20,640
You get the highest point with this.

1290
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,009
If you succeed twice, it's a double strike.

1291
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:25,177
If you succeed three times, it's a triple strike.

1292
01:07:25,177 --> 01:07:27,246
It's so organized. It's amazing.

1293
01:07:27,313 --> 01:07:28,981
- I want to try. - Come here.

1294
01:07:31,951 --> 01:07:33,719
- Here. - Thanks.

1295
01:07:33,953 --> 01:07:36,022
I'll prepare the pins.

1296
01:07:36,022 --> 01:07:37,156
Go get ready.

1297
01:07:37,156 --> 01:07:38,324
Thank you.

1298
01:07:42,995 --> 01:07:46,565
Soo Ah, why are men like this?

1299
01:07:48,334 --> 01:07:51,671
They don't understand why we're so crazy about shopping.

1300
01:07:52,204 --> 01:07:55,608
We should just give up.

1301
01:07:56,842 --> 01:07:58,244
Let's go.

1302
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:07,119
Cart Strike!

1303
01:08:10,089 --> 01:08:20,066
- No matter how much I think - No matter how much I think

1304
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:38,384
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1305
01:08:38,384 --> 01:08:40,486
I was going to do it by myself. Why did you offer to shave?

1306
01:08:40,486 --> 01:08:41,520
I didn't do that on purpose.

1307
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,788
Are you done talking, jerk?

1308
01:08:42,788 --> 01:08:43,956
How dare you?

1309
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:46,025
Let's break up. Let's break up then.

1310
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:47,793
Sure, let's do that.

1311
01:08:47,793 --> 01:08:50,663
- Dong Gu, we were joking. - "Joking"?

1312
01:08:50,663 --> 01:08:53,632
- Come on in. - It's well decorated.

1313
01:08:53,632 --> 01:08:55,634
What is this smell?

1314
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:57,036
Is that his shoes?

1315
01:08:58,137 --> 01:09:00,473
Is this smell coming from his shoes?

1316
01:09:00,473 --> 01:09:01,974
Must they film here?

1317
01:09:01,974 --> 01:09:03,109
2, 3.

1318
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:05,077
I told you...

1319
01:09:05,077 --> 01:09:07,380
that I didn't want to owe you anything.

1320
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,382
Yoon Ah, are you free this weekend?

1321
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:11,717
I want to tell you something.

1322
01:09:11,984 --> 01:09:14,620
- What? Hyun Joon. - Why are you here?

1323
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,022
- Can you lend me some money? - What is this about?

1324
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:18,557
Yoon Ah got in an accident.

1325
01:09:18,557 --> 01:09:20,826
I'll get the money right away. Follow me.
