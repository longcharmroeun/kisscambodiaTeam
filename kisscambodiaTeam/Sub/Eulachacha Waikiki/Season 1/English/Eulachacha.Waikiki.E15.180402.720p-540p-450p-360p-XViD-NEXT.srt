1
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:18,455
What are you looking at for so long?

2
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:20,565
Seo Jin. You should take a look at this too.

3
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:25,565
What do you think of this place?

4
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:28,105
"Guesthouse Boulanger"?

5
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:29,330
What's this about all of a sudden?

6
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:31,260
Well, it's almost spring.

7
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:33,375
I think we should make some changes to our interior.

8
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:36,275
So I'm doing some research on places we can use as reference.

9
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:37,440
Isn't this place nice?

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,700
The interior design is nice, and I like the vibe.

11
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:42,540
The owner even serves homemade bread.

12
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:43,915
- Really? - Yes.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,485
Even the service is great.

14
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:58,490
Dong Gu. I need to go somewhere. I'll be back soon.

15
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:00,830
Right now? Where are you going this late at night?

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,335
There's just something I need to do.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,235
- All right. See you later. - Okay.

18
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:17,785
Yes, Jun Ki. I'm here.

19
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:19,485
Where are you?

20
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:23,925
Seo Jin. It's me.

21
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:26,655
Why did you do that? You startled me.

22
00:01:26,923 --> 00:01:28,095
Come in. Come in.

23
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:33,605
Come over here. Come here.

24
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:36,935
By the way,

25
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:41,130
are you sure you're not being followed? Where is Dong Gu?

26
00:01:41,137 --> 00:01:42,945
He's at home.

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,500
You're overreacting.

28
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:45,845
I'm not.

29
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:48,710
Dong Gu has been watching us even more closely lately.

30
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:50,440
We can't go on dates freely,

31
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:52,310
and I can't tell anyone I have a boyfriend.

32
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:54,155
What is this?

33
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,525
We have no choice.

34
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:59,795
But I have no shooting this weekend.

35
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,020
Should we go on a date?

36
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:03,595
Really? You have no shooting?

37
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:06,665
I'm finally free this weekend too.

38
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:09,960
Why don't we go on a trip?

39
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,330
- A trip? - Yes.

40
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:13,405
We could go on an overnight trip somewhere nearby.

41
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,370
Isn't it too early for us to go on an overnight trip?

42
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:18,845
What are you thinking about?

43
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:22,445
We're going to sleep in separate rooms. Are you crazy?

44
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:24,785
Okay.

45
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:28,085
All right. Let's do it.

46
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,780
Let's go on a trip.

47
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:32,455
Let's do it. Let's go.

48
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:37,535
Hide!

49
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,105
Darn it. I lost her again.

50
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,605
She disappeared somewhere around here.

51
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:49,405
Something definitely is going on.

52
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:55,985
Kang Seo Jin and Lee Jun Ki.

53
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:58,715
I'll catch you guys by all means.

54
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,455
(Hide-and-Seek)

55
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,560
Hurry up. Clean every corner.

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,790
We don't even have many guests these days.

57
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:14,330
Why do we have to clean so often?

58
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,990
- Gosh. - Exactly.

59
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,400
The weather is getting warm. I'd love to go somewhere...

60
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,230
and get some good rest.

61
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:22,100
Don't be absurd.

62
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:23,945
We don't have money for that.

63
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:25,275
Go back to cleaning.

64
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:26,745
Hi, Hyun Joon.

65
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:29,245
I haven't been able to ask them yet.

66
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:31,555
But I don't think I can go.

67
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:33,955
I'm sorry. Bye.

68
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:36,895
What is it? Where were you going?

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,380
Well...

70
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:40,890
My baking class is going on a trip.

71
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,290
But I have to take care of Sol and work at the guesthouse,

72
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,395
so I told him I can't go.

73
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:46,960
Why? Just go.

74
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:49,565
Go with the rest of your class.

75
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,630
You can go. We'll take care of Sol.

76
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:53,700
When is the trip?

77
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,900
This Saturday. It's an overnight trip.

78
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:58,045
What? An overnight trip?

79
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,770
She'll be with Hyun Joon...

80
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:02,485
over the night?

81
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:05,055
She shouldn't. That's not okay.

82
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,485
Wait!

83
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:10,220
Too bad.

84
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,050
The trip just overlaps...

85
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:16,565
with our workshop.

86
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:18,720
Are we having a workshop?

87
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:19,760
Yes.

88
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:22,830
We've been so busy doing the laundry, dishes,

89
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:24,500
and cleaning.

90
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:28,230
So I was planning an overnight workshop.

91
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:30,130
Since when? You said we didn't have money.

92
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,275
What?

93
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:35,310
I was acting. I wanted to surprise you guys.

94
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:36,845
It's a surprise.

95
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,455
Anyway, Yoon Ah,

96
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:42,180
I'm afraid you won't be able to go on that trip.

97
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:44,450
Don't worry. It's no problem.

98
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:47,025
Okay. Do you all have time this weekend?

99
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,395
Hold on.

100
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:50,365
This weekend?

101
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:52,395
I can't.

102
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:54,160
Why? Do you have plans?

103
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,805
Well...

104
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:59,235
I'll spend the night covering a news story.

105
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:00,930
I see.

106
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:03,070
I can't either.

107
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:05,515
I'll be shooting all night this weekend.

108
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:08,245
What? You both will be...

109
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:11,415
working all night this weekend?

110
00:05:11,948 --> 00:05:13,980
- It's true. - It's true.

111
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:15,010
I see.

112
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:17,450
What exactly is this news story you have to cover?

113
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:19,920
What? Well...

114
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,625
It's about a funeral.

115
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,520
What? A funeral?

116
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,590
The weekend is still a few days away.

117
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:28,460
How do you know when that person will die?

118
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:30,205
- It doesn't make sense. - What?

119
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:32,860
Well...

120
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,670
He is in a critical condition right now.

121
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:36,300
- Poor man. - It's very likely that...

122
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:39,745
he'll die this weekend. My boss wants me to stand by.

123
00:05:40,243 --> 00:05:42,410
- Is that right? - Yes.

124
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:44,855
Can I call your boss and ask?

125
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:46,710
What?

126
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:48,385
There he goes again.

127
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,680
Fine. Do it.

128
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:56,025
- Call him right now. - Don't, don't!

129
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:57,565
Are you sure?

130
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,590
I'm calling him now.

131
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:01,205
Push the button right now.

132
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:03,030
Ask him.

133
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm pushing it.

134
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,175
I'm pushing the call button right now.

135
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,345
Okay. That's enough.

136
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,285
Fine. I trust you.

137
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:19,110
But the rest of you have to go, okay?

138
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:20,550
- Okay. - Du Shik and I need to take...

139
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,225
some pictures for our shopping mall this weekend.

140
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,220
You can do that during the workshop.

141
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:28,990
Anyway, we're leaving this Saturday morning.

142
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:31,260
It's decided. End of discussion.

143
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,460
- Okay. - Go back to cleaning now.

144
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:33,805
Let's clean!

145
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,330
Hurry up!

146
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:39,905
Come downstairs.

147
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:43,030
Dong Gu, we haven't been on a trip in so long.

148
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,775
I was so excited I couldn't sleep well last night.

149
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,470
Are you that happy?

150
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:49,370
Yes. Yoon Ah, where is Sol?

151
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,610
She's sleeping.

152
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,140
I want her to sleep some more before we leave.

153
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:53,385
That's a good idea.

154
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:56,610
Hey. Are you moving abroad?

155
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:57,750
What's all that?

156
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:00,155
What do you think? It's the clothes I need for the photoshoot.

157
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,425
All of it?

158
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:04,360
Are you sure you need so many clothes?

159
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,290
Whose fault is it?

160
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:09,930
Who is forcing me to go on this trip?

161
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:11,300
You should, of course, bring them all.

162
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,075
Pack some more. Pack everything.

163
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:16,830
Are you leaving? Have a good time.

164
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,400
- Are you going to work? - Yes.

165
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:20,710
Why are you wearing a backpack to work?

166
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,945
Well...

167
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:25,485
I'll be working all night, so there was a lot to pack.

168
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:28,280
I wish you could come with us.

169
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:29,425
I know.

170
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,750
I'd love to come with you,

171
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:33,890
but I really need to work.

172
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,195
Seo Jin.

173
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:38,120
If you hang out with Jun Ki while I'm away,

174
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:40,665
what will happen?

175
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:47,330
"You will no longer be alive."

176
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,600
Is that what you were going to say?

177
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:50,270
Fine. I'll keep a 500m distance...

178
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:52,640
from Jun Ki at all times. Are you happy now?

179
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:55,515
Great. You can go now.

180
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:01,150
Sol must be up. I'll bring her.

181
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,685
Okay. Bring her.

182
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,295
(Hyun Joon)

183
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:11,795
Why is he calling her now?

184
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,230
Hello. It's me, Dong Gu.

185
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:19,000
Yoon Ah can't talk right now.

186
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,300
What's the matter?

187
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:22,370
I heard you're having a workshop today.

188
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,840
I just wanted to wish Yoon Ah a good time.

189
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:27,570
Don't worry.

190
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:30,270
Yoon Ah will have a great time with us.

191
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,440
You have a good time on your trip too.

192
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:35,485
We have to leave now.

193
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,225
I hung up while he was talking.

194
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,075
Jun Ki, I'm here.

195
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:54,775
What? Where?

196
00:08:54,971 --> 00:08:56,075
3 o'clock?

197
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:57,945
Where are you?

198
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:00,745
Gosh.

199
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:04,085
- You startled me. - Get in before anyone sees us.

200
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:07,685
Oh, right. Remove the cover first. Hurry.

201
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:09,225
My goodness.

202
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:13,525
Are we on a date or a mission?

203
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:17,235
I can't really tell.

204
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,275
Give me your bag.

205
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:31,600
Is this really necessary?

206
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:33,745
There's nothing wrong with being careful.

207
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:38,185
What's this smell?

208
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,410
Something smells weird in here.

209
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,910
I don't know. It smelled like this since Du Shik and Soo Ah...

210
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,395
practiced driving with this car.

211
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,395
Anyway, our first trip starts now.

212
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,535
Seo Jin, are you okay?

213
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,005
I'm all right.

214
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,600
When you get some money, change your car first.

215
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:03,200
Why? Rebecca is still going strong.

216
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:04,575
Look. Rebecca, you're still okay, right?

217
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,615
See? She is okay. She's upset.

218
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:09,045
Let's go. Our trip starts now.

219
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:11,915
What is it?

220
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,525
- Are you sure everything is okay? - Rebecca!

221
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:24,835
The weather is lovely. And the view is so nice.

222
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,095
I'm so happy to be with you.

223
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:31,175
Even the evil Dong Gu is away. It couldn't be better than this.

224
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,635
I know.

225
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:34,805
It must be that place.

226
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:37,275
- We're here. - We are.

227
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,215
Let me park the car.

228
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:45,685
This is nice.

229
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:48,185
Let's go.

230
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:51,325
This place looks amazing.

231
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:54,495
It's called "Boulanger"? Even the name is pretty.

232
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:56,150
How did you find this place?

233
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,490
Dong Gu found it while searching for places...

234
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:00,220
with nice interior designs.

235
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:02,635
It looked so pretty, so I wanted to come.

236
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,235
With you.

237
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,000
Look at you, Bacca.

238
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,705
You wanted to come here with me?

239
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:10,345
Stop it.

240
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,715
- Should we go in? - Sure.

241
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,615
Princess, get on my back.

242
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,685
- Okay. - Let's go.

243
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:23,055
I can't live without Bacca

244
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:25,495
- Are you happy? - Of course.

245
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:33,620
Director Bong, are you okay?

246
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:34,705
I'm not sure.

247
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:36,235
I'm so nauseous.

248
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:38,905
The ride wasn't that long.

249
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,645
Stop nagging, and tap my back.

250
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:43,275
You're a nuisance.

251
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:45,675
Hey, be gentle.

252
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,185
- I might throw up my organs. - Fine.

253
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:53,455
What? "Guesthouse Boulanger"?

254
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:55,925
Are we staying at a guesthouse?

255
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:57,180
Yes, so what?

256
00:11:57,186 --> 00:12:01,250
Why would we stay at a guesthouse when we work at one?

257
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:02,895
A resort would have been nice.

258
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,295
Do you know how much a resort costs?

259
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:07,430
The interior design is pretty,

260
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,165
so I wanted to take a look.

261
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:11,305
What do you think, Yoon Ah?

262
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,005
It's beautiful.

263
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:14,970
Let's go up.

264
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,875
Du Shik, let's go.

265
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,145
Come on.

266
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:21,570
What are you doing? Once you're done, get my luggage.

267
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm really nauseous right now. You carry it.

268
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:27,955
I'm the boss. Do I have to do that?

269
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:29,625
Stop complaining, and bring it.

270
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:34,695
She's such an evil boss.

271
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:36,625
Let's see.

272
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:41,565
I need to look pretty for Jun Ki.

273
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:46,335
Shall I put on some makeup to look sexy?

274
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,575
Soo Ah, this is the women's room.

275
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:53,245
- You're right. - What?

276
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:55,510
That voice sounds familiar.

277
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:57,085
Isn't this great, Sol?

278
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:59,255
Darn it.

279
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,165
The room is well-decorated.

280
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,265
It is. It's nice and cozy.

281
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,465
There's someone else in here.

282
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,575
Is she sleeping?

283
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:21,705
- Let's unpack first. - Shall we?

284
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:23,545
This is great.

285
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:26,245
- How did they get here? - This is good.

286
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:27,985
What happened?

287
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:30,485
Goodness.

288
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:33,515
I'm tired from a long drive.

289
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,225
It's my first trip with Bacca.

290
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:39,025
I'm going to have fun.

291
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,565
Du Shik, it's over here.

292
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:43,265
Really?

293
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,835
Gosh, I'm so nauseous.

294
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:47,765
What?

295
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,090
The voice sounds unpleasant.

296
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,435
Do you need help?

297
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:55,205
Why did she pack so much?

298
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:00,545
The room is big and clean.

299
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:02,270
- Don't you think? - I don't know.

300
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:04,215
I feel sick, so don't make me talk.

301
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,785
There's someone else here.

302
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,950
Is he sleeping?

303
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:11,255
How did they get here?

304
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:12,895
Why?

305
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:16,090
Let's unpack later.

306
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:17,535
Let's take a look around.

307
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,790
I want to rest.

308
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:20,960
Come on, we came all the way here.

309
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:21,990
Let's go.

310
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:23,460
- I feel nauseous. - Let's go.

311
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:25,075
- No. - Come on.

312
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:30,005
What? Why are they here?

313
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:33,115
Are they having their workshop here?

314
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,445
This is unbelievable.

315
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:38,885
Wait, what about Seo Jin?

316
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,525
Yoon Ah, Soo Ah.

317
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,210
Unpack later, and come out.

318
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:44,655
Okay, we're coming.

319
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:47,125
- Shall we go, Yoon Ah? - Shall we?

320
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:49,450
Sol, let's take a look.

321
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,535
- Let's go with Mom. - Let's go.

322
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:57,775
Did they come here for their workshop?

323
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,375
I can't believe this.

324
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:02,345
Gosh, I should go see Jun Ki.

325
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,975
There's a swimming pool. Did you bring your swimsuits?

326
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,385
Gosh, it's amazing here.

327
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:11,710
- Isn't it amazing? - Yes.

328
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,585
- Hello. - Here are some towels.

329
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:16,250
- Thank you. - Let me know if you need anything.

330
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:17,755
Okay, thank you.

331
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,295
The guesthouse is beautiful.

332
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:22,995
Thank you.

333
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:27,165
Do you manage this big guesthouse alone?

334
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:29,430
I didn't see any staff.

335
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:32,035
It's expensive to hire people, so I run it with my wife.

336
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:35,945
Actually, we also run a guesthouse in Seoul.

337
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:37,470
Is that so?

338
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:41,185
Are you staying at a guesthouse when you run a guesthouse?

339
00:15:42,011 --> 00:15:43,985
Pardon? Yes.

340
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:47,725
Then why did you make a reservation at the last minute?

341
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,425
Thankfully, the rooms were still available...

342
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,290
Aren't you busy?

343
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:57,690
- You should go and work. - Okay.

344
00:15:57,693 --> 00:15:59,235
Call me if you need anything.

345
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:02,405
He's a talkative one, indeed.

346
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:07,330
Anyway, you worked hard to clean...

347
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:08,700
and do laundry.

348
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:10,975
You also worked hard to serve the guests.

349
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:13,115
Forget about the guesthouse,

350
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,115
and let's have fun, okay?

351
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:16,840
What shall we do?

352
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:20,115
I'm sorry, but I'll rest because I feel nauseous.

353
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,325
I'm about to faint.

354
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:24,295
Okay then.

355
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,425
Let's go back in.

356
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:27,665
I'll walk you.

357
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:32,235
Jun Ki? Jun Ki?

358
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,165
Gosh, where did he go?

359
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,775
Du Shik, are you sleeping?

360
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:42,975
Gosh, what is this?

361
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,445
Come on.

362
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:50,485
Lie down.

363
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,685
- Thank you. - Get some sleep.

364
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,310
I'll wake you up when we eat.

365
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,480
I'll join you in a little while.

366
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:01,395
Don't worry about me, and have fun.

367
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,295
Okay.

368
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,390
Call me if you need anything.

369
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:06,835
- Okay. - Okay.

370
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:08,635
Goodness.

371
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:15,705
He's sleeping for a long time.

372
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:30,185
Seo Jin? Seo Jin?

373
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:33,025
Where did she go?

374
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,125
Let's eat, Sol.

375
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:38,465
- It's time to eat. - What?

376
00:17:38,694 --> 00:17:41,205
Mom will feed you. Good girl.

377
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,730
Were you hungry? I'll feed you.

378
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:48,545
Hold on a bit. Let's see.

379
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:50,975
What?

380
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:54,275
Where did it go?

381
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:55,945
Why? Did something disappear?

382
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:58,210
My camera disappeared.

383
00:17:58,213 --> 00:17:59,685
I definitely put it here.

384
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:01,780
What if you put it somewhere else?

385
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:04,255
No, I definitely left it here.

386
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,225
Where did it go?

387
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:12,535
Excuse me? I'm sorry to bother you.

388
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:15,365
Have you seen a camera here?

389
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:21,070
When we were gone,

390
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,605
did someone else come by?

391
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,145
Go.

392
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,815
She's being suspicious.

393
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:31,815
Excuse me, shouldn't you respond when someone asks you a question?

394
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:34,525
How dare you?

395
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:38,980
What? Jun Ki.

396
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,725
Dong Gu. Why are you here?

397
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:43,895
What? Soo Ah.

398
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:46,695
You're here too.

399
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:48,660
What brings you here?

400
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:52,130
We came for the workshop. Why are you here?

401
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:53,805
- Didn't you have a shoot? - What?

402
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:55,745
Well...

403
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:59,445
I have an outdoor shoot nearby today and tomorrow.

404
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:01,410
The waiting time was so long.

405
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,545
I got a room, and I was sleeping.

406
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,540
Why are you sleeping in the women's room?

407
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:08,355
What? Is this the women's room?

408
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,195
I came where the host told me to.

409
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,865
Gosh, what was he thinking?

410
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:16,820
I should file a complaint.

411
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:19,235
He must've gotten it confused because he runs it alone.

412
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,665
- There's your camera. - Where?

413
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,575
I found it.

414
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,345
You didn't even look properly.

415
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:31,945
Thank you.

416
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:36,385
I can't believe that you're here.

417
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:38,885
Let's go.

418
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:43,125
I didn't imagine I'd see you here.

419
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,925
- What a coincidence. - I know.

420
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:48,925
It's such a terrible coincidence.

421
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:53,060
If Seo Jin didn't have work, all of us would be here.

422
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:54,295
That's unfortunate.

423
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,535
Right, you're right.

424
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,805
It can't be helped. Isn't the view beautiful?

425
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:05,845
How could there be a guesthouse at a place like this?

426
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,845
What? Why is there a rope?

427
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:10,315
I didn't see it before.

428
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:13,485
Is this a bell?

429
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,895
Sir!

430
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:20,525
Are you okay?

431
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,395
I'm so sorry.

432
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:25,790
I was cleaning. Why did you pull the rope?

433
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:28,835
- He's such a troublemaker. - Gosh, I'm so sorry.

434
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:31,805
- Shall I take you to the hospital? - It's okay.

435
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:36,075
A group of guests is coming soon. What should I do?

436
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,515
I have to clean and get groceries.

437
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:40,345
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,645
Let me ask you for a favor.

439
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:44,285
What favor?

440
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:54,095
Nice going.

441
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:57,320
You told us to forget the guesthouse and have fun.

442
00:20:57,326 --> 00:20:58,465
What's this?

443
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:01,905
What else could I do? He got injured because of me.

444
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:03,490
It's fine for us,

445
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:06,600
but you dragged Yoon Ah from her baking class orientation.

446
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:08,045
Good job, Dong Gu.

447
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:10,075
I'm sorry, Yoon Ah.

448
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,440
It's okay. It's nice to fold towels where the air is fresh.

449
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,315
It's easier to fold them.

450
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:21,810
We only have to do this until he returns from the hospital.

451
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:23,585
- Hang in there. - Okay.

452
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:28,525
It's the owner.

453
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,265
Hello?

454
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:33,495
Pardon?

455
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:35,165
All right.

456
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:38,475
I see.

457
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:41,100
What is it? What did he say?

458
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:43,675
Well, he says he's going to take longer than expected.

459
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:47,175
He asked us to take good care of the arriving guests,

460
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:49,210
and he wants us to do the grocery shopping.

461
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:52,285
I can't believe this. This is so annoying.

462
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:55,110
I'm sorry. I'll go do the grocery shopping.

463
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:57,610
Could you guys just take care of the cleaning here?

464
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,920
Will you be all right on your own?

465
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:01,250
You'll probably have a lot to buy.

466
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:03,995
Then you two go together. We'll take care of Sol.

467
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,635
Right, Jun Ki?

468
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:08,360
Yes, all right.

469
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:09,935
Then I'll leave Sol with you guys.

470
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,675
Mommy will be back soon, all right?

471
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:15,775
- Let's go, Dong Gu. - All right. Let's go.

472
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:17,940
- See you later. - All right.

473
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,015
I'm sorry.

474
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,910
Why do you seem so agitated?

475
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:28,350
Why do you keep groaning? Is something wrong?

476
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,655
What? No, nothing's wrong.

477
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,190
Jun Ki. Help me.

478
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,620
I'm locked in the boys' room.

479
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:41,565
Why is she in the boys' room?

480
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,130
Since I'm done mopping the floor here...

481
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:48,830
I'll go change the bed sheets in the males' rooms.

482
00:22:48,837 --> 00:22:50,345
All right.

483
00:22:58,747 --> 00:22:59,985
Jun Ki.

484
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:04,010
- Du Shik. - What? Why are you here?

485
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,420
Didn't you say you had a shoot today?

486
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,655
Well, you see,

487
00:23:06,922 --> 00:23:08,650
the set is close by,

488
00:23:08,657 --> 00:23:10,750
so I booked a room here.

489
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,965
Really?

490
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:13,690
I can't believe this. What a coincidence.

491
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:14,835
You're right.

492
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:18,035
I'm so surprised that I think I'm going to cry.

493
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:25,845
Why are you staying in bed when you came all the way here?

494
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,345
Let's go outside, Du Shik.

495
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,040
I don't feel like it. I was carsick.

496
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,915
I feel nauseous and dizzy.

497
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:35,080
Then that gives you more reason to get some fresh air.

498
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,680
Why don't you and I go for a walk?

499
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:37,880
I'm tired. I don't feel like it.

500
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:40,080
Then get some sleep.

501
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:42,450
- I'm not sleepy. - Just close your eyes then.

502
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:44,490
I don't want to. I have a game to play.

503
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:45,720
Why are you just staying in this room?

504
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:47,890
Because I want to. Why are you getting angry?

505
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:49,035
What?

506
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:53,635
That's because I'm worried about you.

507
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:54,830
I'm worried about you.

508
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,930
Since when did you start worrying about me so much?

509
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:59,215
Never mind. I need to play this game, so don't talk to me.

510
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:01,115
Gosh. You're no help.

511
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,470
Jun Ki. What's keeping you? We have a guest.

512
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,715
- Hurry and come out. - All right. I'll be right there.

513
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,780
Anyway, don't you dare move.

514
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:13,350
Stay here just a while.

515
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,590
I'll find a way to get you out of here.

516
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,335
You trust me, right? Wait just a while.

517
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:20,295
I'll be right back, all right?

518
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:27,605
What's wrong with him?

519
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:30,545
Why is he trying to get me out of here when I said I'm dizzy?

520
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:34,885
What do we have to buy?

521
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:38,485
They said a group of guests want to have a BBQ party for dinner.

522
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:41,015
- Shall we buy the vegetables first? - All right.

523
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,685
There's a vegetable shop right over there.

524
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:45,880
- Hello. - Hello. What can I get you?

525
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,950
Please give us some lettuce and perilla leaves.

526
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:49,420
Just enough for about 10 people please.

527
00:24:49,424 --> 00:24:50,565
All right.

528
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:52,960
You must be newlyweds.

529
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:54,930
You two make such a nice couple.

530
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,105
- Pardon? - Pardon?

531
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:59,405
It's so nice to see your husband doing grocery shopping with you.

532
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:02,370
My husband and I used to do that too.

533
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,775
You two look so nice together. I'll throw in some more for free.

534
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:08,540
No. You see...

535
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:11,515
Thank you very much. We appreciate it.

536
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:14,010
My husband here loves lettuce.

537
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,580
Honey, we're in luck, don't you agree?

538
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:17,350
- What? - My goodness.

539
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:20,395
Your wife is so sweet. You must be so happy.

540
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:24,395
- Have a happy marriage. - Thank you.

541
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:26,560
Honey, let's go.

542
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:28,805
- What? - Let's go.

543
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,600
What do you think you're doing? Did you call me "honey"?

544
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:38,515
She insisted on giving us more. Why would we tell her the truth?

545
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:41,170
We can eat the lettuce we got for free, right?

546
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:43,415
I don't think that was right of us.

547
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:45,915
It's not right to lie, Yoon Ah.

548
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:48,885
Honey.

549
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:52,620
Pork belly is your favorite food,

550
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:56,320
but I'm so poor I can only buy you 1,200 grams of it.

551
00:25:56,324 --> 00:26:00,365
You can eat 1,200 grams of pork belly in no time.

552
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:03,035
It won't be enough. What shall I do?

553
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:09,845
Honey.

554
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:13,170
You love apples more than anything in the world.

555
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:16,810
This is all I can afford because I'm poor.

556
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:18,915
What shall I do?

557
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:22,885
This is so upsetting.

558
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:31,095
What are you doing? You told me I shouldn't lie.

559
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:35,235
We got some free meat and fruits. That's good, isn't it?

560
00:26:41,036 --> 00:26:42,905
What else did you say we have to buy?

561
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:46,515
Yoon Ah. Come with me for a second.

562
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,410
- What is it? - Just go that way.

563
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,545
Where are we going?

564
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:52,655
Why are we here?

565
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,055
Let's see. This is pretty.

566
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:00,795
Come over here.

567
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:17,805
Dong Gu.

568
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,345
It's just that...

569
00:27:21,343 --> 00:27:24,745
your bangs seemed to keep falling and covering your eyes.

570
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,385
If you end up falling down, that'll only cause me trouble.

571
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:31,285
That's why I'm buying this for you, so there's no need to feel awkward.

572
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,925
This doesn't mean anything. I assure you.

573
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:38,195
Thank you.

574
00:27:39,027 --> 00:27:40,135
It's nothing.

575
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:42,435
- Thank you. - Thank you.

576
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,605
Let's get going then.

577
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:54,215
Yoon Ah.

578
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:55,915
Let's go.

579
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:06,020
- Yoon Ah. You like sundae, right? - Yes.

580
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:08,595
- Shall we go eat some sundae? - Shall we?

581
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,865
- We'd like two servings of sundae. - All right.

582
00:28:21,937 --> 00:28:25,170
Why? Do you want to drink rice wine too?

583
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:27,370
What? No, it's not that.

584
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,045
It's just that those men are drinking rice wine with such relish.

585
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,455
Then you should have some.

586
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:34,110
- Excuse me. - Yes?

587
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:36,480
Please give us a bottle of rice wine.

588
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:38,955
- You didn't have to. - It's all right.

589
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,965
This is delicious.

590
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:53,675
Gosh. Is it that good? Do you want another glass?

591
00:28:53,735 --> 00:28:56,430
I might get drunk if I drink more.

592
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:59,500
We're here to relax. Who cares if you get a bit drunk?

593
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:00,700
Go ahead and have another glass.

594
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,045
Shall I then?

595
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,195
I shouldn't have given her that second glass of rice wine.

596
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:21,135
Gosh. My eyes are burning.

597
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,660
Why are we lighting charcoal when we should be having fun?

598
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,400
The more I think about it, it makes me so annoyed.

599
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:31,270
Why on earth did you guys have to come here?

600
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:34,215
Why are you yelling at me? Dong Gu chose the location.

601
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:38,045
- It's not ready yet? - It'll be ready soon.

602
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,355
There. It's done.

603
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:41,850
You can grill the pork here.

604
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,551
All right. Thank you.

605
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,025
That looks good.

606
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:53,061
Would you like to join us? We bought plenty of meat.

607
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:54,162
Really?

608
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:55,563
That's right.

609
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:58,266
Du Shik didn't have anything to eat all day. He must be hungry.

610
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:00,635
I should go ask him if he wants to eat some.

611
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:03,204
I'll go. I'll go. You wait here.

612
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:06,374
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

613
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:09,110
Sol. Do you see this? It's meat.

614
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,788
Du Shik. They invited us to eat meat.

615
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:20,922
Let's go out together.

616
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:23,625
I don't want to. I feel nauseous. I don't feel like it.

617
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:26,061
I can't stand the smell of them cooking the meat.

618
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:27,095
How can I eat it?

619
00:30:27,095 --> 00:30:29,631
Who knows? If you eat it, you might not feel nauseous anymore.

620
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:31,666
No. I told you I feel nauseous.

621
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,702
If you're so nauseous, how come you can't let go of your phone all day?

622
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,971
At least get some sleep, will you?

623
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:39,507
I told you I'm not sleepy. Why do you keep yelling at me?

624
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:42,310
You jerk.

625
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:47,816
Hang in there.

626
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:50,618
You have to be strong, all right?

627
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:54,155
I'll make sure I find a way to get you out of this room,

628
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:55,223
all right?

629
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:02,530
I'm not going out. I don't want to go out.

630
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:03,898
What the matter with him?

631
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:05,567
Why is he telling me to stay strong?

632
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:09,304
This is amazing.

633
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,609
Why are you alone? Doesn't Du Shik want to eat?

634
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:16,478
No. He said he doesn't want to.

635
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:19,781
Really? He really must be sick.

636
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:21,583
You should eat some then.

637
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,786
No. I'm not hungry.

638
00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:31,493
Jun Ki. I want to eat pork belly. I'm famished.

639
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:35,497
How can she crave pork belly in this situation?

640
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:38,766
I can't believe her.

641
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,174
Give that to me.

642
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,110
What are you doing? Why would you take that?

643
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:51,079
You said Du Shik didn't want it.

644
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,482
Well...

645
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:58,186
I saw a starving cat over there.

646
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,588
I feel so sorry.

647
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:03,825
- Can I give this to the cat? - Sure.

648
00:32:03,992 --> 00:32:05,160
Thank you.

649
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:13,735
Kitty, kitty

650
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:17,172
I used to call you

651
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:25,013
Why are you here again?

652
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:26,614
I said I didn't want any pork belly.

653
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:28,750
I'm not here to see you. Mind your own business.

654
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:31,019
- Then why are you here? - It's none of your business.

655
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:32,420
Focus on your game.

656
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,855
Why do you keep yelling at me?

657
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:37,325
What's that cup?

658
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:39,194
This?

659
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:43,665
It's coffee.

660
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:56,377
Now that I've seen you lying here, I'm leaving.

661
00:32:56,377 --> 00:32:58,346
- Hold on. - What?

662
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:00,815
Where did the coffee go?

663
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:03,518
What?

664
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:05,787
Well...

665
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:10,158
Ta-da.

666
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:12,093
It's magic.

667
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:13,828
It completely disappeared.

668
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,029
Where could it be?

669
00:33:15,597 --> 00:33:17,498
Amazing. That's awesome.

670
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:18,600
How did you do it?

671
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,934
Do it again.

672
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:21,369
Show me.

673
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:23,438
What are you talking about? Get lost.

674
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,809
It was in his hand.

675
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,377
Where's the lettuce?

676
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:30,912
Gosh.

677
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:34,549
Don't be like that. Show me again.

678
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:35,883
I just think it's so interesting.

679
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:37,652
Are you sure?

680
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,654
Is that what you want?

681
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:42,123
Yes. I want to see it again.

682
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:43,591
Show me.

683
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:45,026
Give me a second.

684
00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:50,098
What? Aren't you going to show me the magic?

685
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:51,299
Where are you going?

686
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:02,210
Ta-da.

687
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:06,314
Amazing. That's incredible.

688
00:34:06,314 --> 00:34:08,583
Where did it go? Show me one more time.

689
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:10,351
What are you talking about? Get lost.

690
00:34:11,486 --> 00:34:12,654
Where did it go?

691
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:16,291
Where's the garlic and ssamjang?

692
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:21,429
Don't be like that. Show me one more time.

693
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:23,197
Are you serious?

694
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:24,866
Are you kidding me?

695
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:28,269
Must you really take everything...

696
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:31,105
to feel satisfied?

697
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,574
What are you talking about?

698
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:35,310
I'm just so curious.

699
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,512
Show me one last time.

700
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:40,815
All right. If you say so.

701
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,128
Ta-da.

702
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,366
It amazes me every time.

703
00:34:58,433 --> 00:34:59,734
Where did it go?

704
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:00,968
That was the last time.

705
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,837
I'm telling you.

706
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,405
I can't do it anymore.

707
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:06,641
Don't ask me for anything more.

708
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:08,042
All right.

709
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:09,711
But that was incredible.

710
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:11,279
When did you learn that trick?

711
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,747
Whatever. Get lost!

712
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:16,684
Get lost! Why do you have to yell?

713
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:41,542
Yoon Ah, you're getting drunk. Stop drinking.

714
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:44,078
I'm not drunk at all.

715
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:45,847
I'm perfectly fine.

716
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:47,782
All right. But stop drinking.

717
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:50,017
We still need to pick up some more stuff.

718
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:52,153
Okay.

719
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,756
By the way,

720
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:57,058
do you like to play hide-and-seek?

721
00:35:57,692 --> 00:35:58,893
Hide-and-seek?

722
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:02,597
I love it so much.

723
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,332
Do you want to play hide-and-seek with me?

724
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:07,168
What are you talking about?

725
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:09,670
We're not done yet. Get up.

726
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:19,347
- How much is it? - 14 dollars, please.

727
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:25,486
Here.

728
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:27,355
- Bye. - Bye.

729
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:28,890
Yoon Ah, let's go.

730
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:31,192
Wait.

731
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:33,861
Yoon Ah.

732
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:36,764
Where did she go?

733
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:38,833
My goodness.

734
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,235
Yoon Ah.

735
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,137
Yoon Ah.

736
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:45,072
Where is she?

737
00:36:45,273 --> 00:36:46,441
Yoon Ah.

738
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:47,775
Yoon Ah.

739
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,179
Yoon Ah.

740
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,313
- Hey. - Yes?

741
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:54,649
Over there.

742
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:01,956
What are you doing here?

743
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,593
You found me.

744
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:08,563
You finally found me.

745
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:10,031
I'm it now.

746
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:12,500
Go hide.

747
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:15,436
What are you talking about?

748
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,238
Pull yourself together.

749
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:20,441
She was fine earlier. What happened to her?

750
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:23,511
Well... She drank some rice wine. She's a bit drunk.

751
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,047
Oh, right. I need some green onions.

752
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:27,181
Okay.

753
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,651
Here.

754
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,355
Wait.

755
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,792
Yoon Ah. Where did she go?

756
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:41,696
She's driving me crazy.

757
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:49,904
What are you doing here?

758
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:53,541
You found me again.

759
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:55,776
I'm it now.

760
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:57,812
Go hide.

761
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:59,213
My goodness.

762
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,116
Why are you so obsessed with hide-and-seek?

763
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:03,217
You don't want to hide?

764
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,152
Okay.

765
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:07,755
I'll hide again.

766
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,324
Where are you going?

767
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:12,693
Let go of me.

768
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:17,031
- I have to hide. - What should I do with you?

769
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:27,542
Dong Gu, let go of me.

770
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:29,644
I have to hide.

771
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:31,279
Be quiet!

772
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:34,148
What a weird drunken habit.

773
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:35,950
Follow me.

774
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:38,819
Gosh.

775
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:41,489
My goodness.

776
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,128
Let me hide.

777
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:06,547
Yoon Ah. Snap out of it!

778
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:09,250
Gosh, you found me again.

779
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,521
Fine. You can hide now.

780
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,256
I'm it.

781
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,658
My goodness.

782
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,026
Go hide.

783
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:20,595
All right.

784
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:22,630
I'll be it this time too.

785
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,865
You go hide, okay?

786
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,203
There is a place I'll never be able to find.

787
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,105
Where is it?

788
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:33,341
It's over there. Follow me.

789
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:34,675
Come.

790
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:46,020
If I hide here, you won't be able to find it?

791
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,488
I won't.

792
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,024
Okay.

793
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:56,597
Be quiet.

794
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,099
Hide now.

795
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,901
Dong Gu, I'm hiding.

796
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,336
Try to find me.

797
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:03,604
Okay.

798
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:07,008
You're hiding so well.

799
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:09,343
I have no idea where you are.

800
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,946
What should I do?

801
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:18,319
What am I doing now?

802
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,880
Gosh, you found me again.

803
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:49,817
Dong Gu, you should go hide. I'll be it.

804
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,519
Stop it.

805
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:54,221
Pull yourself together.

806
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:58,726
Are you angry at me?

807
00:40:58,726 --> 00:40:59,994
I'm not.

808
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:02,430
No, you are angry at me.

809
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,864
I'm not.

810
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:05,166
I'm sorry.

811
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:08,202
I'm so sorry, Dong Gu.

812
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:09,870
You don't have to be.

813
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,406
Get some sleep on the way.

814
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:13,741
Please.

815
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:19,380
- Dong Gu. - What is it now?

816
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:22,750
I'm giving you a hard time, right?

817
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,653
I know that.

818
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:28,222
But...

819
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:31,859
I'm scared.

820
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,531
I'm scared...

821
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,268
that you'll get hurt again.

822
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,206
I'm really scared.

823
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:51,679
So don't hate me, all right?

824
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:55,483
Please don't.

825
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,045
Du Shik, how are you? Are you feeling better?

826
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:27,681
Yes, I'm feeling better.

827
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,683
Really? That's good.

828
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:31,452
Should we go out for some fresh air?

829
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:34,221
I will after I finish this. This is the last round.

830
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:40,027
What? What is this sound?

831
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:43,931
Was it someone snoring?

832
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:46,567
That person was sleeping even before we got here.

833
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,102
How long has it been?

834
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:51,739
What's that?

835
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:54,308
Why does a man have such long hair?

836
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:55,643
I know, right?

837
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:58,746
- Wait. - What?

838
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:00,514
Is he wearing clothes with floral patterns?

839
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:01,615
Floral patterns?

840
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,150
He is.

841
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,886
And I think it's a dress.

842
00:43:05,886 --> 00:43:07,288
Are you sure it's a man?

843
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:11,292
What... What are you talking about? Of course it's a man.

844
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:13,394
A lot of men have long hair nowadays.

845
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:15,996
And don't you know unisex?

846
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,232
No one really draws a line between women's clothes and men's clothes.

847
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:20,100
See? My shirt has a floral pattern too.

848
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,735
- Hey, that hurts. - What are you doing?

849
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,705
But it's still strange.

850
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:26,841
And how can a man have a better body line than me?

851
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,342
- What? - I think so too.

852
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,477
- Maybe it's a woman. - What?

853
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:32,279
Soo Ah, go check.

854
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,347
- Shall I? - Yes.

855
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,149
Why do you need to check?

856
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:36,517
We don't need to interrupt a sleeping person.

857
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:38,018
That's not polite. Don't do it.

858
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:40,454
Move over. I'll just get a peek.

859
00:43:41,956 --> 00:43:43,757
- Gosh. - Move.

860
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:44,992
Oh, my.

861
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:51,365
Gosh.

862
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:55,202
It's a man. He has a beard.

863
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:58,205
- A beard? - Really? I thought it was a woman.

864
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,609
- Wait. - What?

865
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:03,677
Seo Jin is a woman, but she has a beard too.

866
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:04,979
- Seo Jin? - Hey.

867
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:08,048
No woman on earth would have a beard like her.

868
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,383
That makes sense.

869
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,452
Well, now that you're feeling better,

870
00:44:11,452 --> 00:44:13,020
we should go outside for the shoot when Dong Gu arrives.

871
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,121
All right.

872
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:32,206
Yoon Ah.

873
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:35,743
Yoon Ah. We're here.

874
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:02,796
My goodness.

875
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:06,100
Dong Gu.

876
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:08,869
What happened?

877
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,938
What do you think?

878
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:14,341
You got drunk and tried to play hide and seek.

879
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:15,676
Do you know how much trouble it was...

880
00:46:15,676 --> 00:46:18,312
for trying to find you in the marketplace?

881
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:20,314
Gosh, did I really do that?

882
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:22,116
I'm sorry.

883
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:25,386
I have a habit of playing hide and seek when I'm drunk.

884
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:29,356
I didn't do anything else other than that, right?

885
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:33,861
- No. - That's a relief.

886
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:37,164
I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

887
00:46:37,431 --> 00:46:39,867
It's fine. Take some rest.

888
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:41,402
I'm fine.

889
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:43,470
We have a lot to do. I need to go outside.

890
00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:45,572
Gosh.

891
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:58,152
Where are the others? It's almost time. Seriously.

892
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:00,120
Hello?

893
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,056
The guests must be here.

894
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:03,690
Hello.

895
00:47:07,545 --> 00:47:08,460
Hyun Joon.

896
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,864
Yoon Ah, what are you doing here?

897
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:13,340
Was this where you were going for the workshop?

898
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,060
Yes. How did you come here?

899
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,317
This is the guesthouse that my friend owns.

900
00:47:19,602 --> 00:47:21,640
This is so cool.

901
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,505
I see. What a coincidence.

902
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:32,619
Let's move the luggage to the lobby first.

903
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:33,854
All right.

904
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,926
What's happening outside? It's so loud.

905
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:40,194
The guests must have arrived.

906
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,762
- Let's go, Du Shik. - Okay.

907
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:50,237
Seo Jin, wake up. Seo Jin.

908
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:52,840
What?

909
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,041
Wake up.

910
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,976
How can you sleep right now?

911
00:47:57,911 --> 00:47:59,680
What's this? What happened?

912
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,215
I don't know, but we don't have time.

913
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:02,816
Let's hurry and go outside before the others come back.

914
00:48:02,816 --> 00:48:03,951
All right.

915
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:12,426
Why is he there?

916
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:13,861
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

917
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:17,731
Seo Jin, I don't think we can go out this way. What should we do?

918
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:19,833
Really? What should we do then?

919
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:23,303
All right. Let's go through the window.

920
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:25,706
Open it.

921
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:28,308
What's wrong with this?

922
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:32,012
- It must be broken. - What?

923
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:34,448
Gosh, that's a problem.

924
00:48:34,615 --> 00:48:36,917
We can't get caught by Dong Gu.

925
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:38,785
What should we do?

926
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:45,192
Right.

927
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:47,594
What is it? Do you have any ideas?

928
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:49,463
- Seo Jin. - Yes?

929
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,064
Go inside that bag.

930
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:54,835
What? Go inside the bag?

931
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:56,036
Are you crazy?

932
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,171
What do you want me to do?

933
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:59,373
Du Shik is in front of the door, and the window is broken.

934
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:00,941
Do you want to go inside the sheets again?

935
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,876
What will you do if you get caught?

936
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:04,711
Do we really need to do this?

937
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:06,547
There's no other way.

938
00:49:07,748 --> 00:49:09,516
All right. All right.

939
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:11,752
All right. Go inside.

940
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,762
Seriously.

941
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,567
Seo Jin, get in here.

942
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:29,002
- Gosh. - Hurry.

943
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,705
All right.

944
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:34,041
I'll get you out quickly.

945
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,726
Just wait a moment.

946
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:11,278
Oh, my. Seo Jin.

947
00:50:11,545 --> 00:50:13,380
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

948
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:17,684
Let's go.

949
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,219
- Jun Ki. - Gosh!

950
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:22,222
You made me jump. Why were you so surprised?

951
00:50:22,656 --> 00:50:24,825
Where are you going with my luggage?

952
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:27,995
Well, I'm...

953
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,931
Are you helping me with my bag to the shooting?

954
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:32,699
- Thanks. - Wait...

955
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:33,767
Why is it so heavy?

956
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,769
Hey, wait...

957
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:39,072
Darn it.

958
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:40,474
Why is it so heavy?

959
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:42,743
- Why is it... - Keep pulling.

960
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,985
Why do you keep following us?

961
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,654
- That's true. - What?

962
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:57,324
I just wanted to help you two.

963
00:50:57,758 --> 00:50:59,726
Isn't your luggage heavy, Soo Ah?

964
00:51:00,027 --> 00:51:01,194
Shall I carry it for you?

965
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:02,496
I'd be grateful.

966
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:03,764
Okay.

967
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:05,399
Let's go.

968
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:14,141
- Hurry up. - Okay.

969
00:51:15,642 --> 00:51:17,711
Anyway, I'm so happy to see you.

970
00:51:17,778 --> 00:51:20,113
I was sad that you couldn't come.

971
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,682
I can't believe that we met here.

972
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:24,785
I know. I had no idea that the guesthouse was run...

973
00:51:24,785 --> 00:51:26,119
by Hyun Joon's friend.

974
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,022
What should we do now?

975
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:31,258
It's too early to eat.

976
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:33,293
Shall we play a game?

977
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:34,628
That's a great idea.

978
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:37,030
- What shall we play? - Let's play 007.

979
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,565
- Electricity game. - Let's play What If.

980
00:51:38,565 --> 00:51:43,070
Come on. The perfect game for situations like this...

981
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,038
is foot volleyball.

982
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:46,273
Foot volleyball?

983
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:48,241
We have women.

984
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:49,810
We can't play foot volleyball.

985
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,979
Both men and women can play sports.

986
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:55,048
What you say will cause misunderstanding.

987
00:51:55,048 --> 00:51:57,217
It's because everyone is tired.

988
00:51:57,217 --> 00:51:59,019
I don't think playing ball is a good idea.

989
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:02,055
Why don't we play an indoor game?

990
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:03,190
How about Express with Your Body?

991
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,159
Foot volleyball is perfect for orientation.

992
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,427
Don't you agree, Yoon Ah?

993
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:11,298
I still have a headache, so foot volleyball won't be easy.

994
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:13,667
I think Express with Your Body sounds good.

995
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,603
Play with us, Dong Gu.

996
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,840
Okay, why not?

997
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,782
I'm terrible at this.

998
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:31,852
We lived under the same roof for a long time.

999
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:33,286
I don't know about Hyun Joon,

1000
00:52:33,353 --> 00:52:36,289
but I can guess everything that you express.

1001
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:38,525
(Egg)

1002
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:44,798
The answer is fart.

1003
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,371
The answer is constipation.

1004
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:52,606
You can't take a dump.

1005
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:55,709
- Egg? - That's correct.

1006
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,844
(Shrimp)

1007
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:02,115
I know the answer! Is it a zombie?

1008
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:04,351
A zombie with a broken back!

1009
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:06,052
Shrimp.

1010
00:53:06,052 --> 00:53:07,954
That's correct.

1011
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,159
What's that? What is it?

1012
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,794
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being".

1013
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:19,566
"Even if the world goes to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree."

1014
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:20,700
That's correct.

1015
00:53:21,902 --> 00:53:23,537
You're so good, Hyun Joon.

1016
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:24,771
How did you guess that?

1017
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:25,939
How is that possible?

1018
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:27,274
That's impossible.

1019
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,511
Here we go. That looks good.

1020
00:53:31,511 --> 00:53:32,579
One more.

1021
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,381
That looked fake. Try something else.

1022
00:53:35,515 --> 00:53:36,683
That's good.

1023
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:39,386
- Seo Jin, Seo Jin. - Jun Ki.

1024
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:40,854
- Stop. - One more.

1025
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:45,592
- Are you okay? - How long do I have to stay here?

1026
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:49,262
My legs hurt, and it's suffocating.

1027
00:53:49,663 --> 00:53:51,798
I'm sorry. Hang in there.

1028
00:53:51,965 --> 00:53:53,633
I'll do something, okay?

1029
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,902
Whom are you talking to, Jun Ki?

1030
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:58,205
What? I...

1031
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:00,474
I'm talking to the rock.

1032
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:04,744
It must be frustrating to be stuck.

1033
00:54:05,178 --> 00:54:07,481
You're such a hard rock.

1034
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:10,050
What are you talking about?

1035
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,318
Let me get my outfit.

1036
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:13,253
- I need it for my next shoot. - You can't.

1037
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,156
You startled me. What do you mean that I can't?

1038
00:54:16,156 --> 00:54:18,124
No, you can't take this suitcase.

1039
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:20,293
What? It's my suitcase.

1040
00:54:20,293 --> 00:54:21,661
- Get out of my way. - No way.

1041
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:23,630
I can't give you this suitcase.

1042
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,898
Are you out of your mind?

1043
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:26,733
What's wrong with you? Give me my suitcase.

1044
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:28,301
No, no!

1045
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:35,575
What's wrong with him?

1046
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:37,744
Du Shik, stop Jun Ki now.

1047
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:43,617
Jun Ki. Hey, Jun Ki!

1048
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:44,851
What's wrong with him?

1049
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:50,257
Goodness.

1050
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,140
Where did he go?

1051
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,776
Why did he take my suitcase?

1052
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:11,945
I know. Has he lost his mind?

1053
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:14,014
I don't think he's here.

1054
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:15,782
- Let's go over there. - Okay.

1055
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,125
Wait.

1056
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:27,294
It's over now.

1057
00:55:29,863 --> 00:55:31,064
Where did she go?

1058
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:34,701
What happened?

1059
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:37,203
Did I...

1060
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:39,973
Darn it.

1061
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:42,576
Seo Jin. Seo Jin.

1062
00:55:43,043 --> 00:55:45,712
Seo Jin! Wait for me!

1063
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:51,718
(Shrimp)

1064
00:55:51,718 --> 00:55:52,786
("The Unbearable Lightness of Being")

1065
00:55:54,254 --> 00:55:56,756
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being".

1066
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:59,392
Aren't you hungry after the game?

1067
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:01,761
Shall we eat something?

1068
00:56:01,962 --> 00:56:03,096
Really?

1069
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,098
Everyone should rest.

1070
00:56:05,098 --> 00:56:07,901
Men are supposed to cook when we're on a trip.

1071
00:56:08,602 --> 00:56:10,003
I'll cook.

1072
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:12,339
Wait.

1073
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:15,942
Then do it with the real man, Kang Dong Gu.

1074
00:56:16,843 --> 00:56:18,878
- Do you know how to cook? - Of course.

1075
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:21,781
I've been a guesthouse CEO for many years.

1076
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:24,618
Most chefs can't cook as well as I do.

1077
00:56:24,684 --> 00:56:26,052
Is that so?

1078
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:28,254
Then let's cook together.

1079
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:30,223
That sounds good. Let's go.

1080
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:32,192
I'll show you a real man's taste.

1081
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,235
What are you making?

1082
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:46,039
I'll grill some meat and make kimchi stew.

1083
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,174
Kimchi stew?

1084
00:56:48,174 --> 00:56:50,043
I was going to make that as well.

1085
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:51,511
That's what I do best.

1086
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:52,812
How will you make it?

1087
00:56:52,812 --> 00:56:54,914
I'll add some pork neck and kimchi.

1088
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:56,449
Don't I just boil that?

1089
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:59,552
The best kimchi stew is made...

1090
00:56:59,552 --> 00:57:01,955
with mackerel pike.

1091
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:04,691
Isn't the easiest pork kimchi stew?

1092
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:07,427
You don't know, do you?

1093
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:09,963
Shall we place a bet on which is better?

1094
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,564
That sounds good.

1095
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:14,701
Let's start.

1096
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:56,142
Why did you make two pots of kimchi stew?

1097
00:57:56,376 --> 00:57:57,410
Here's why.

1098
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:01,047
Hyun Joon and I like different types of kimchi stew.

1099
00:58:01,915 --> 00:58:03,116
Try them.

1100
00:58:03,116 --> 00:58:05,452
Let us know which one tastes better.

1101
00:58:05,585 --> 00:58:08,121
We placed a bet.

1102
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:10,090
Really?

1103
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,958
Then shall we try some?

1104
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,864
It's greasy.

1105
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:23,436
This one is perfect.

1106
00:58:24,437 --> 00:58:27,874
You're right. I prefer the kimchi stew with pork.

1107
00:58:27,874 --> 00:58:29,008
How about you, Yoon Ah?

1108
00:58:35,315 --> 00:58:36,583
It's delicious.

1109
00:58:38,251 --> 00:58:39,385
How about that one?

1110
00:58:47,494 --> 00:58:48,995
It's delicious,

1111
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:51,331
but it's a little greasy.

1112
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:54,868
I don't really like fish.

1113
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,002
Yes.

1114
00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:59,873
Why? Did Dong Gu make the one with mackerel pike?

1115
00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:04,544
Who wins isn't important.

1116
00:59:04,544 --> 00:59:07,247
Everyone should enjoy it together.

1117
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:09,449
I'm sorry.

1118
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,018
It's okay.

1119
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:15,421
I need to get some fresh air.

1120
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:31,771
The weather is nice.

1121
00:59:31,771 --> 00:59:33,273
The air is great too,

1122
00:59:33,273 --> 00:59:35,608
but Song Hyun Joon isn't.

1123
00:59:35,942 --> 00:59:39,112
Song Hyun Joon, Song Hyun Joon, Song Hyun Joon, you scum.

1124
00:59:39,112 --> 00:59:42,215
He's ruining everything. Everything.

1125
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:57,397
I don't think anyone is going to eat this. Should I throw it away?

1126
00:59:57,397 --> 00:59:59,432
Just leave it. I'll eat it.

1127
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:01,568
- You don't like fish. - What?

1128
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,538
But it looks delicious.

1129
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,140
All right.

1130
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:32,131
I knew he was out of his mind,

1131
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:34,100
but I really don't understand.

1132
01:00:34,267 --> 01:00:37,070
Why would he run away with my bag?

1133
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,538
He must be crazy.

1134
01:00:38,538 --> 01:00:41,608
Just leave him be. Don't try to understand his mind.

1135
01:00:41,608 --> 01:00:42,675
Just leave him be.

1136
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:45,545
Gosh, we couldn't do anything because of him.

1137
01:00:48,114 --> 01:00:49,782
- Jun Ki. - Jun Ki.

1138
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:52,952
Give that bag to me.

1139
01:00:52,952 --> 01:00:55,388
What? What's wrong with you?

1140
01:00:55,388 --> 01:00:58,258
Just give it to me. Give it to me.

1141
01:00:58,258 --> 01:01:01,661
Did it do something wrong to you? What's wrong with you?

1142
01:01:01,794 --> 01:01:03,162
Give it to me!

1143
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:05,398
- No! - Give it to me!

1144
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:07,300
It's my bag. Leave it be.

1145
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,202
- Give it to me. - What's wrong with you?

1146
01:01:09,202 --> 01:01:10,303
Give it to me.

1147
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:20,580
My new clothes! What are you going to do about it?

1148
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:23,249
Seo Jin. Seo Jin!

1149
01:01:23,249 --> 01:01:24,984
What are you talking about?

1150
01:01:24,984 --> 01:01:27,120
Gosh, Seo Jin!

1151
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:34,894
Seo Jin!

1152
01:01:34,894 --> 01:01:36,596
- Seo Jin! - What is he doing?

1153
01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:40,300
No! No! No! Seo Jin!

1154
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,401
Seo Jin!

1155
01:01:41,401 --> 01:01:44,103
Wait, what is he talking about? Seo Jin?

1156
01:01:44,103 --> 01:01:46,439
I don't know. He must be crazy.

1157
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:47,573
Seo Jin!

1158
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:51,411
No, Seo Jin. Seo Jin.

1159
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:52,645
Why are you looking for Seo Jin?

1160
01:01:52,645 --> 01:01:54,514
- Jun Ki. - Seo Jin.

1161
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:58,785
- Come here. - Come here.

1162
01:01:59,385 --> 01:02:01,421
- Push. - Seo Jin.

1163
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:07,827
Seo Jin. Seo Jin.

1164
01:02:10,797 --> 01:02:12,098
What's that?

1165
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:13,900
Are you all right?

1166
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:17,470
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1167
01:02:17,804 --> 01:02:18,905
I'm fine.

1168
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:20,840
Seo Jin?

1169
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,011
Why was she in the suitcase? What happened?

1170
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:30,083
No way. Could it be...

1171
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:31,751
magic?

1172
01:02:31,985 --> 01:02:34,754
That's so cool. You could do magic like this?

1173
01:02:34,754 --> 01:02:37,323
What? What do you mean, magic?

1174
01:02:37,457 --> 01:02:40,927
Jun Ki, what happened? Why is she here?

1175
01:02:41,127 --> 01:02:43,930
- I... - What are you doing there?

1176
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:47,433
- What's up? - Dong Gu.

1177
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:50,636
Seo Jin, why are you...

1178
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:53,940
You told me you were covering a funeral.

1179
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,909
Dong Gu, I...

1180
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:58,244
Wait.

1181
01:02:58,878 --> 01:03:01,481
What is this bad feeling I'm getting?

1182
01:03:02,682 --> 01:03:05,818
I feel like I'm about to find out something horrible.

1183
01:03:05,818 --> 01:03:08,287
What is this bad feeling?

1184
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:12,658
I... Well... I...

1185
01:03:13,092 --> 01:03:16,362
Jun Ki, let's just stop here.

1186
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:18,998
Let's tell him the truth.

1187
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:21,034
The truth?

1188
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:22,835
What are you talking about?

1189
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:27,607
Well, I... The thing is...

1190
01:03:28,641 --> 01:03:32,211
Are you going to keep hiding? All right. Let's end all this.

1191
01:03:32,512 --> 01:03:34,180
You jerk.

1192
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:50,096
What's this?

1193
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:54,400
What are you doing?

1194
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:56,669
Why are you holding hands?

1195
01:03:57,437 --> 01:04:01,040
Dong Gu, I like Seo Jin.

1196
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,975
What?

1197
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:05,845
What?

1198
01:04:07,246 --> 01:04:08,781
What are you talking about?

1199
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:10,683
I, Lee Jun Ki,

1200
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:14,654
like your sister, Kang Seo Jin.

1201
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:17,490
No, I love her.

1202
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:21,928
What? Love?

1203
01:04:24,564 --> 01:04:26,499
So that means,

1204
01:04:26,866 --> 01:04:30,303
you two are in love?

1205
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:36,075
- Are you serious? - Yes, I love her.

1206
01:04:36,676 --> 01:04:37,844
So...

1207
01:04:38,544 --> 01:04:41,981
you can choose to either kill me or keep me alive.

1208
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:43,783
Kill you or keep you alive?

1209
01:04:45,384 --> 01:04:46,452
All right.

1210
01:04:47,787 --> 01:04:50,456
- Then die! - Stop, Dong Gu!

1211
01:04:50,456 --> 01:04:52,358
How can you do this to me?

1212
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:55,528
You didn't tell me anything! My sister?

1213
01:04:55,528 --> 01:04:56,896
You scum!

1214
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:58,931
When did this start? When!

1215
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:00,266
- Stop. - Tell me!

1216
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,116
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1217
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:19,352
You've been lying to me all along.

1218
01:05:19,352 --> 01:05:21,854
- You're not my sister anymore. - Dong Gu, I need to talk to you.

1219
01:05:21,854 --> 01:05:23,956
And you mean nothing to me.

1220
01:05:23,956 --> 01:05:26,159
Don't talk to me or even pretend to know me.

1221
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,496
I'm not going to shave my beard until you let me go out with Jun Ki.

1222
01:05:30,496 --> 01:05:31,497
What?

1223
01:05:31,497 --> 01:05:33,666
He's the Park Bo Gum of the modeling industry.

1224
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:35,468
I'm Min Soo Ah.

1225
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:37,003
That's too bad.

1226
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,639
- What is this? - What is this smell?

1227
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:41,307
It smells so bad.

1228
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:45,077
- I'm sorry. - I don't feel like shooting today.

1229
01:05:45,077 --> 01:05:48,181
You should just stay here. You scum!

1230
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:51,150
That's good news. Let's have a celebratory drink.

1231
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:53,519
I should celebrate with you.

1232
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:56,022
Hyun Joon, weren't you going to tell me something?

1233
01:05:56,022 --> 01:05:57,056
In fact, I...

1234
01:05:57,056 --> 01:06:00,226
Hyun Joon is a better person than I originally thought.

1235
01:06:00,226 --> 01:06:02,094
You're really stupid, do you know that?

1236
01:06:02,094 --> 01:06:03,296
Yoon Ah.
