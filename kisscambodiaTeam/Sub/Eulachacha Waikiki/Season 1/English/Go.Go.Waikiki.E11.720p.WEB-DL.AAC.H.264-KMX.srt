3
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:15,115
Oh, Dong Gu.

4
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:19,934
Yoon Ah, I have something to tell you.

5
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:22,175
What? What is it?

6
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:25,048
I like you.

7
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,262
I really like you, Yoon Ah.

8
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,149
Dong Gu, what do you
mean by that suddenly?

9
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,780
I like you, Yoon Ah, so...

10
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:45,692
would you like to date seriously?

11
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,804
I don't want to.

12
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:56,143
What? But... why?

13
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:59,567
Is it because of the situation you're in?

14
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:00,615
Don't worry.

15
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:04,765
I told you my feelings with the intention
of taking responsibility for you and Sol.

16
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:09,993
Did I ever ask you to
take responsibility for me and Sol?

17
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:11,543
That's not what I meant.

18
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:17,150
Then did you think a single mom
would always say yes to a confession?

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,450
Is that what you thought?

20
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,496
- Yoon Ah, that's not it.
- Forget it.

21
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:25,075
I'm going to pretend that
we didn't have this conversation.

22
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:28,296
Excuse me. Yoon Ah.

23
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:35,567
You left your phone in my car.

24
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:38,408
Thank you. Get home safely.

25
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:40,513
Yes. Goodbye.

26
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:57,129
Hey, are you all right?

27
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,787
Su Ah, I just got rejected, right?

28
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,337
Yes, in five seconds, at that.

29
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:04,159
Five seconds?

30
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,575
Why? I don't understand why.

31
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,758
Chewbacca, why are you
here on the weekend?

32
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,299
There's no weekend
when you're on probation.

33
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,609
I have to review all of
the variety and drama shows.

34
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:16,479
I always have to do these tasks.

35
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,590
Gosh, you wanted so badly
to be a reporter.

36
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,079
Now, you're complaining?

37
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,292
Why does my ear itch so much?

38
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,139
Chewbacca, since you have a job now,
look at my ear for me.

39
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:33,455
I think there's a big one in my ear.

40
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:37,106
What are you doing?
Clean out my ear.

41
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:43,007
Seriously, what are you doing?

42
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,646
You can say no with words!
Why are you shoving me?

43
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:47,157
What did I do?

44
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,551
Gosh.

45
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,753
Yoon Ah, talk to me.

46
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:55,424
Why don't you want to date me?

47
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:57,293
Even if I get rejected,
I need to know why.

48
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:59,631
Huh? What? What is this?

49
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,844
Rejected? What does that mean?

50
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:03,867
- Huh?
- Stay out of it, Joon Ki!

51
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:05,468
Tell me. What's your reason?

52
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:08,269
I just have no intention
of dating you, Dong Gu.

53
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,716
I don't want to talk about it anymore,
so I can go, right?

54
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:15,020
Hey, what is this about?

55
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,519
Dong Gu, you're saying you like Yoon Ah?

56
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,098
Dong Gu likes Yoon Ah,
but he got rejected in five seconds.

57
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:22,730
What?

58
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,913
Five seconds? Five seconds? Really?

59
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:30,766
Dong Gu, where are you going?

60
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:38,300
<i>Yoon Ah, I have to tell you something.</i>

61
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,379
I like you.

62
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:41,680
I really like you, Yoon Ah.

63
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:54,534
<i>I don't want to.</i>

64
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:59,134
Did I ever ask you to
take responsibility for me and Sol?

65
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:08,368
<i>[The Night of the Living Dead]</i>

66
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:22,562
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:26,113
Su Ah, am I that unattractive
in your eyes too?

68
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:27,932
Aren't I pretty decent?

69
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:31,249
My looks are not bad and I'm tall.

70
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,350
I'm tall.

71
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,461
I'm tall...

72
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:41,764
Still, aren't I a pretty good catch? No?

73
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:46,423
Do you want the truth or do you
want lies that make you feel good?

74
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:48,144
Never mind.

75
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:49,632
Forget it.

76
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:51,572
I'm going to the bathroom.

77
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:02,105
<i>[Older Bro]</i>
Oh no.

78
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,415
Su Bong thinks I'm in the US.

79
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,675
Hello?

80
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:13,490
Oh, Su Bong. Hi.

81
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,110
Why are you calling?

82
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,283
Why else? I'm your brother.

83
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,624
I didn't even get to say goodbye
to you when you left.

84
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:21,444
I called because
I wanted to hear your voice.

85
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:23,884
I got back today after training.

86
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:26,514
Right, you have a competition soon.

87
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:28,225
I'm going to Hong Kong in two days.

88
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,293
How is life in the US?

89
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,072
It's great. I like it a lot.

90
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:33,572
So good, very good.

91
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:35,432
That's a relief.

92
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:39,425
Su Bong, I'm in a bit of rush
and I can't really talk now.

93
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,521
This is an international call

94
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,615
but it sounds like
you're right beside me.

95
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:46,942
You know how good
technology is these days.

96
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,995
Su Bong, I'll call you back later.

97
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,627
- Okay. Talk to you later.
- Okay. Bye.

98
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:52,800
Bye.

99
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,411
- Su Ah.
- Su Bong.

100
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:57,101
Hey, what are you doing here?

101
00:05:57,101 --> 00:05:58,267
You said you were in the US.

102
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:01,016
Oh, Su Bong. So, so...
I'll explain it all.

103
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:04,423
Su Ah, let's go home
and sleep. I'm tired.

104
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:06,642
Oh, Dong Gu!

105
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:08,031
Su Bong.

106
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,411
Wait. Go home and sleep?

107
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,903
You two live together?
I thought you broke up.

108
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:14,182
Well--

109
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:17,129
I broke up with Yoon Seok
and I'm dating Dong Gu again.

110
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:20,007
You'd worry if you knew
I broke up with Yoon Seok

111
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:21,255
so I pretended to be in the US.

112
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,358
Really? But, why are you
living at Dong Gu's place?

113
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:26,170
- What happened to your place?
- Hm?

114
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,369
Oh, Dong Gu said
we're getting married anyway.

115
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:34,269
He felt we should save on rent
and just live together.

116
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,889
Marriage? You two are getting married?

117
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,747
Wow! Really?

118
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:41,845
We shouldn't stay out in the cold.
Let's go back to your place.

119
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,600
- We'll be right behind you.
- Okay.

120
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,581
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

121
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,050
You know his personality.

122
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,040
Dong Gu, help me out this once.

123
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,319
If he figures out I was conned,
I'll be so dead.

124
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,814
Okay, okay.

125
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,978
Wait. Isn't Joon Ki home right now?

126
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,175
Dong Gu likes Yoon Ah.
Isn't that big news?

127
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:05,538
Isn't it bigger news that he got
rejected in five seconds?

128
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:09,019
From now on, Dong Gu's
nickname is Five Seconds.

129
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,769
To make it short, Fise.

130
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,009
- Oh.
- Fise.

131
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:16,673
Fise, Fise, Fise.

132
00:07:16,673 --> 00:07:18,639
Fise, Fise...

133
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,185
Who is this?

134
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,591
- It's Dong Gu.
- Fise?

135
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,019
Hello, Fise.

136
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,187
What do you mean?
It's your nickname, Fise.

137
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:31,541
What?

138
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:33,887
Su Bong?

139
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:36,673
Su Bong is coming?

140
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,747
Here? Darn it.

141
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,807
- What do you mean Su Bong's coming?
- I don't know.

142
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:44,588
I'm going to run now.
Let me know when he's gone, okay?

143
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:47,644
If I get caught this time,
Su Bong will really kill me.

144
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:50,583
<i>Wow, it's been a really long time.</i>

145
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,168
<i>Guys, I'm here with Su Bong!</i>

146
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,348
<i>It's been a long time
since Su Bong's been here!</i>

147
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,769
<i>How long has it been?</i>

148
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,160
Oh! Doo Shik and Seo Jin!

149
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,699
How long has it been?

150
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:08,411
Oh, you guys.
You cuties. I missed you!

151
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,750
You're still strong as always.

152
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,903
<i>You cuties!</i>

153
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:17,202
Oh, it's nice to see you, Su Bong.

154
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:19,754
Hey, I'm a little hurt by you two.

155
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:22,052
If you knew Dong Gu and Su Ah were dating

156
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:24,990
you should've let me know.

157
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,930
What? Su Ah and Dong Gu are dating?

158
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,483
I told him that we're dating again.

159
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:35,657
Ah, Su Ah asked us to keep it a secret.

160
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:39,426
You guys are so loyal.

161
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:41,755
A man has to be loyal.

162
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,956
- Loyalty!
- Loyalty!

163
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,873
Loyal...

164
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:49,577
Wow, this place is the same as always.

165
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,043
What's this?

166
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,046
It's a picture of Joon Ki.

167
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,850
Why is this still here?

168
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:09,774
Why do you have a picture of a dead guy?

169
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,160
Joon Ki...

170
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:20,604
I still can't believe
that Joon Ki is dead.

171
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:23,538
Joon Ki...

172
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:27,982
Our Joon Ki... Joon Ki.

173
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:30,893
<i>Yeah, who knew Joon Ki
would pass away like that?</i>

174
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,243
How could he suddenly
be hit by lightning?

175
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:34,452
I know.

176
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:37,052
That punk was punished by God.

177
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:41,023
He dares to steal a friend's girl?
My girlfriend, at that?

178
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:43,288
<i>I shouldn't speak this way
about the dead.</i>

179
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:46,202
But it could be a good thing
that he died that way.

180
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:49,446
If I had caught him then...

181
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,831
he wouldn't have
been able to die or live.

182
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:55,774
He would've lived in a hospital forever.

183
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,783
There's mail for Joon Ki...

184
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:05,014
Where's Joon Ki?

185
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,693
Joon Ki? What's she talking about?

186
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,828
Yoon Ah, there you go again.

187
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:13,610
- Joon Ki is dead!
- What?

188
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,932
What do you mean, he's dead?
He was just here a moment ago.

189
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:19,004
Yoon Ah, you didn't
take your medicine, did you?

190
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:20,591
I told you not to miss your doses.

191
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:21,594
Follow me.

192
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:23,325
- What is this garbage?
- Oh my.

193
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:26,807
- You are out of your mind!
- Where's Joon Ki?

194
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:31,736
What is she saying and who is she?

195
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:34,187
She's an employee here.

196
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:37,097
She can't get over
the trauma of Joon Ki's death.

197
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,317
She still thinks that he's alive.

198
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:40,946
Really?

199
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:43,734
That's unfortunate for a young person.

200
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,299
<i>Will she get better
if she takes medicine?</i>

201
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:50,440
What?

202
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,092
Joon Ki stole away
Su Ah's brother's girlfriend?

203
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:58,727
So, Su Bong threw a fit,
insisting that he'd kill Joon Ki.

204
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:01,716
So, you all lied and said Joon Ki died?

205
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:04,456
We were against it,
but Joon Ki wanted it that way.

206
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,606
The thing is, Su Bong is a UFC athlete.

207
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:11,067
A human weapon.
19 matches, 19 wins, 19 KOs.

208
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,726
Still, he's alive...

209
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:16,357
Then, where is Joon Ki right now?

210
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:29,352
<i>Why did he have to show up suddenly?</i>

211
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:32,075
<i>This is so uncomfortable.
I'm going crazy.</i>

212
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,375
<i>I'm sure he'll leave soon.</i>

213
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:37,982
What was that sound?

214
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:40,548
I think it came from over there.

215
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,399
Oh, sorry. I have a cold.

216
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,205
<i>Really?</i>

217
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,993
By the way, Seo Jin...

218
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:55,744
- Do you still grow a mustache?
- What?

219
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:58,962
It has always been growing.
Why would it suddenly stop?

220
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,014
Oh, I'm tired.

221
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:04,955
Su Bong, it's getting late.
Shouldn't you get going?

222
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:08,033
Yes, I should get back to our dorm.

223
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:12,099
Yes, Coach.

224
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,033
Really? Yes, I understand.

225
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,442
- That's going to be a problem.
- Is something wrong?

226
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:20,354
The boiler in our dorm is broken.

227
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:22,696
What do I do now?

228
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:26,868
Ah... I can just stay here.

229
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:29,995
Dong Gu, I'm leaving
the country in two days.

230
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:32,695
I can stay here until then, right?

231
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:34,825
What?

232
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,774
Two days?

233
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:40,948
<i>Oh, Su Bong. You have a competition soon.</i>

234
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,572
You should take care of yourself.

235
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:44,974
There are many people here.
It's noisy and uncomfortable.

236
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,774
It's okay. It's okay.

237
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:50,033
I always stay in dorms with others.

238
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:53,389
Oh right. We have no rooms left.

239
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:54,989
I sleep well on sofas too.

240
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,076
Then, I'll sleep on the sofa.
You can sleep in our room.

241
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,399
Don't you know
I don't like to be a burden?

242
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,119
Then why don't we have a beer
and drink to loyalty!

243
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:04,998
I can't eat just anything
because of the competition coming up.

244
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:08,458
Also, I want to watch some dramas
I missed out on while training.

245
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,780
So, don't worry about me and go to sleep.

246
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,250
Still...

247
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:16,370
Yes. Rest up, Su Bong.

248
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,493
It's scary at night.

249
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:20,278
- Have fun watching.
- All right.

250
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:22,892
<i>- Have fun watching.
- Okay.</i>

251
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:33,163
So good, so good. Totally good.

252
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:37,057
Kim Nam Joo, Ji Jin Hee... wow.

253
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:39,028
<i>Awesome.</i>

254
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:41,100
What should I watch now?

255
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,294
Oh yeah. "Wife's Desire."

256
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,443
I heard it has so many awesome twists.

257
00:13:46,443 --> 00:13:49,405
<i>Why is he watching dramas at this hour
instead of sleeping?</i>

258
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:53,489
<i>I have to pee and my legs are numb.
I'm seriously going crazy.</i>

259
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:55,846
<i>Oh, I have to pee.</i>

260
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:58,527
<i>What do I do here?</i>

261
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:09,164
<i>Did I ever ask you to
take responsibility for me and Sol?</i>

262
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:11,015
<i>I'm going to pretend
we didn't have this conversation.</i>

263
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:14,226
I just have no intention
of dating you, Dong Gu.

264
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:24,888
<i>Dong Gu, I have to pee. Help me.</i>

265
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:30,187
<i>Doo Shik, I have to pee. Save me.</i>

266
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:41,932
I'm so sick of this.
This is never-ending.

267
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:44,921
I wonder if Joon Ki is okay.

268
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:49,107
What is this? Why am I worried about him?

269
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:51,398
You're crazy, you're crazy.
You're really crazy.

270
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:54,284
Pull it together. Get it together.

271
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:55,548
What is it?

272
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,195
<i>I'm about to pee myself.
Save me, Chewbacca.</i>

273
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:02,869
Why would I care about a guy like this?

274
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:07,969
I can start from episode eight.

275
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:12,258
Oh, I'm so excited. What do I do?

276
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:17,326
<i>Tonight the star is me. It's me, it's me.</i>

277
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:18,691
<i>It's me, it's me.</i>

278
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:21,096
- Seo Jin, why aren't you sleeping?
- What?

279
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:23,740
I was looking for something.

280
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,727
- Oh.
- Where did it go?

281
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:30,028
<i>I have been waiting for you.
It's me, it's me.</i>

282
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:31,797
Why do you have an empty bottle?

283
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,769
What?

284
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:36,589
Oh, my hand felt empty.

285
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,765
- Really?
- Oh, how empty.

286
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:44,485
<i>The person to steal your heart is me.
It's me, it's me.</i>

287
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:47,048
Thanks, Seo Jin.

288
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:55,506
Oh... what's that?

289
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,548
What's that sound?

290
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,207
Is there water leaking somewhere?

291
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:04,038
What sound? I don't hear anything.

292
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:06,634
- I heard something.
- I think I'll watch this too.

293
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,224
Why is the volume so low?

294
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:11,639
Hey, that's too loud.

295
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,259
Oh, I have some hearing troubles.

296
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,883
<i>Seo Jin, it's overflowing.
My pee is overflowing.</i>

297
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:39,576
<i>The last person you want is me.
It's me, it's me.</i>

298
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:41,250
<i>It's me, it's me.</i>

299
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,386
<i>Tonight the star is me. It's me, it's me.</i>

300
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:47,660
<i>It's me, it's me.</i>

301
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:00,336
What are you doing so early?

302
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:02,476
What are you writing?

303
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,695
What is it?

304
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,661
<i>[Why, why, why, why?]</i>

305
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,194
What?

306
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,205
You were doing this all night?

307
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:17,615
I can't understand it,
no matter how much I think about it.

308
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:20,145
- Doo Shik, am I that bad?
- No.

309
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:22,715
You're pretty great.
You're the best out of all my friends.

310
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:25,886
Right? So, why does Yoon Ah not like me?

311
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:28,705
Shouldn't she take some time to think,
at the very least?

312
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:30,316
I suppose so.

313
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,066
What did you say to her?

314
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,973
Yesterday, I held Yoon Ah.

315
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,597
"I like you. Let's date."

316
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:40,089
I confessed my feelings like a man.

317
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,548
Wait.

318
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:44,076
So, you told her your feelings
on the street?

319
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:45,685
Without one flower, you just told her?

320
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:47,167
Yes. What about it?

321
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,018
Hey, that's not right.

322
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:51,917
I wouldn't accept you either with
such a boring confession like that.

323
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,798
Really?

324
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:56,137
- Do you think that's why?
- Yes.

325
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:57,742
Now I think I understand.

326
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:00,513
- Hey, Doo Shik!
- Even I wouldn't make that mistake.

327
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,775
I thought it was manly, but it wasn't.

328
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:07,262
Hey, is Joon Ki still down there?

329
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:14,525
<i>Oh.</i>

330
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,518
<i>I fell asleep.</i>

331
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,126
<i>What is this?</i>

332
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:23,395
<i>Is it morning?</i>

333
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:27,122
<i>I can't tell if it's
day or night in here.</i>

334
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:32,856
<i>Oh, my legs hurt so much.</i>

335
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,816
<i>Is he still out there?</i>

336
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,724
Oh! What is going on?

337
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:44,075
Oh my gosh.

338
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:48,994
<i>What kind of an athlete
watches so many dramas?</i>

339
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,270
<i>You're saying
you're my father's daughter?</i>

340
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:56,221
His daughter-in-law was his daughter?

341
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:58,251
Wow, that's insane.

342
00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:01,474
Oh! Oh, that's crazy.

343
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,541
Wow.

344
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,281
Su Bong, did you sleep well?

345
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:07,829
Yes, yes.

346
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:10,226
- You should have breakfast.
- It's okay.

347
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:13,343
I have to watch "Wife's Desire,"
so be quiet.

348
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:20,194
<i>Do you remember Yoo Geum Ran,
whom you cast away 30 years ago?</i>

349
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:21,844
<i>How do you know about her?</i>

350
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:25,118
<i>Because I am her daughter.</i>

351
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:26,795
<i>What? You...</i>

352
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:29,557
Wow! That's huge...

353
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,708
His wife is his daughter too?

354
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:35,994
It's one of the best dramas ever.

355
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:39,367
Wow! Seriously, awesome.

356
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:42,955
<i>Oh!</i>

357
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:49,109
Is he an athlete or
a drama monitoring person?

358
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:50,940
Why does he watch so many dramas?

359
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,523
My brother is obsessed with dramas.

360
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:57,131
He uses half his fight winnings
on online VOD.

361
00:19:57,131 --> 00:20:00,369
- Gosh.
- What's Joon Ki going to do?

362
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:03,013
Where is Yoon Ah anyway?

363
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:05,984
She made breakfast and went to
her academy to do something.

364
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:08,846
How long have you liked her anyway?

365
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,195
It's been a while.

366
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:13,255
I thought a lot about it,
so don't tell me what to do.

367
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,826
Fine.

368
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:18,165
I'm late. I think I'll go eat
at the convenience store.

369
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:19,252
Hey.

370
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,023
I'm coming too.

371
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:25,501
Where are you going? What about Su Bong?

372
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:28,692
I have to catch Yoon Seok
before my brother finds out.

373
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,491
I'm dead if my brother finds out.

374
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,689
Dong Gu, watch over my brother.

375
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,967
Let's go.

376
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,477
You're such a pain.

377
00:20:35,477 --> 00:20:37,189
This is too much for me.

378
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:40,992
Dong Gu, I have to go to work.
Watch Sol for me.

379
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:42,615
Have fun playing.

380
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,659
Okay, get going.

381
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,386
Sol.

382
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,511
What does your mom like?

383
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:56,845
How can I confess my feelings
so that your mom will like it?

384
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:59,066
Huh? What?

385
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:03,342
You just said something.
Tell me in words.

386
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,944
Not just those sounds,
but say some words.

387
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:09,519
Talk to me.

388
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:14,946
Gosh, why isn't he showing up?

389
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:17,676
I have to get him
before my brother finds out.

390
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,512
How should they fight here?

391
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,109
You're still writing that?

392
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,855
Do you make money from writing that?

393
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:24,660
- No.
- Then why do you write it?

394
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,217
Because it's something I like to do.

395
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:31,519
Gosh, your life sure is suffocating.

396
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,442
How should I write it?

397
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:36,439
Should he do a finger jab here?

398
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:38,932
- What's a finger jab?
- A finger jab?

399
00:21:40,214 --> 00:21:43,779
It's one of the moves that Bruce Lee
made for Jeet Kune Do.

400
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,810
It's a scary move that you use to
poke the eyes of your opponent.

401
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,392
Poke their eyes?
What kind of martial arts is so petty?

402
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,737
Jeet Kune Do is about
ending a fight in a short time.

403
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:55,946
What kind of idiot would let you poke
their eyes?

404
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:57,836
You really don't know anything.

405
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:59,728
The finger jab is super fast.

406
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:01,777
- You want to see?
- Okay.

407
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:18,886
You see. It's fast, right?

408
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:20,663
You can't see it,
but you think you can avoid it?

409
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:22,989
Why can't I? Try it on me.

410
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:25,078
You have no fear.

411
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:28,253
Hey, don't regret it.

412
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:31,340
Then... I'm coming in.

413
00:22:35,576 --> 00:22:38,617
Ow, that hurts! My finger hurts.

414
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:39,971
Quiet.

415
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:41,442
<i>This makes no sense.</i>

416
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,419
<i>There's my daughter-in-law and wife.</i>

417
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:45,522
<i>My daughter was
not my biological daughter.</i>

418
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:49,347
- <i>I was betrayed in this place.</i>
- No way.

419
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:52,057
<i>I must leave this place.</i>

420
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,567
<i>Thunder.</i>

421
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,923
Wow.

422
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:08,430
<i>I must return to the place I came from.</i>

423
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,367
<i>Goodbye. Goodbye.</i>

424
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,558
<i>[Thank you to the viewers
who watched "Wife's Desire."]</i>

425
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:23,820
Bravo. Awesome.

426
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,280
The dad was an alien.

427
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,201
The title is "Wife's Desire,"
but the dad is an alien.

428
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:29,571
Amazing twist.

429
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:32,131
Best drama ever!

430
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:34,300
I'll remember it forever.

431
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,670
How could they think of
something like that?

432
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,583
I really do have to tell Yoon Ah
how I feel properly this time.

433
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,871
How can I do it with Su Bong around?

434
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,351
I need to watch it again.

435
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:49,459
I'm seriously going crazy.

436
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:53,921
Yoon Ah, you're here early.

437
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:58,046
Hello, I just decided to come early.

438
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:05,142
By the way...
who was that yesterday?

439
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:08,019
He's the CEO of
the guest house I live in.

440
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,602
Oh, I see.

441
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:13,980
- Yoon Ah, how come yesterday--
- Hyun Joon.

442
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,239
I don't want to talk about that.

443
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:20,300
Yes, I'm sorry.

444
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,548
I need to go to the restroom.
Watch the counter for me.

445
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:33,659
Okay.

446
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,718
Oh, this is boring.

447
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:38,971
How long do I have to keep this up?

448
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:43,730
Excuse me. Do you have that ramen today?

449
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,096
Huh? What ramen?

450
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,470
That ramen.

451
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,455
Wait.

452
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,122
That voice.

453
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:10,448
Hey. You!

454
00:25:10,448 --> 00:25:11,814
Su...

455
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:15,111
Oh, stop right there!

456
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,605
You're dead.

457
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:20,999
- Wait.
- Where do you think you're going?

458
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,959
Give me my money. Give it back!

459
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,068
Let go!

460
00:25:24,068 --> 00:25:25,674
Thai... Thailand.

461
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:27,222
Move!

462
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:28,900
Whoa.

463
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,119
- Stop him. It's that fraud.
- Move.

464
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,622
I said, move.

465
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,529
Oh, what are you doing?

466
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,950
- Move.
- Put it down. I'll get hurt.

467
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,441
So, move unless you want to get hurt.

468
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:42,060
I said, move.

469
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:46,611
Oh, what do I do? What do I do?

470
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:48,603
Ah!

471
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,039
- What... what are you doing?
- What are you doing?

472
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,790
You'll really get hurt doing that.

473
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,230
Finger... finger...

474
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,721
Why, you!

475
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:07,673
Jab, jab, jab!

476
00:26:08,473 --> 00:26:11,910
Ow, my finger. It hurts.

477
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,085
That hurts!

478
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:14,797
You fraudulent punk!

479
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:16,147
Doo Shik, call the cops now.

480
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:17,801
Hey, how petty to poke me in the eye.

481
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:19,700
Finger jab.

482
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,828
<i>I must return to the place I came from.</i>

483
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:27,251
- <i>Goodbye.</i>
- Awesome.

484
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:29,730
It's so good even the second time around.

485
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,211
<i>The writer is a genius. Wow.</i>

486
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:36,541
Oh.

487
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,502
My body is so stiff
from watching TV all day.

488
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,511
I'd better go for a jog.

489
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,358
Oh, the light.

490
00:26:57,685 --> 00:27:01,018
My legs. They hurt so much.

491
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,453
It's cold... so cold.

492
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:16,515
Lee Joon Ki.

493
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:20,391
You're dead. What are you doing here?

494
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:23,162
What is this? Have you been lying to me?

495
00:27:23,162 --> 00:27:24,493
Did you know my older brother?

496
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:26,814
What do you mean, brother?

497
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,010
You must think I'm Joon Ki.

498
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:35,101
I'm not Joon Ki.
I'm his twin, Lee Joon Gu.

499
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:38,211
- What, his twin?
- Yes.

500
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:41,123
Joon Ki had a twin?

501
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,123
What's going on? Why is it so noisy?

502
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:51,846
- Hey, Dong Gu.
- Yes.

503
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:54,616
- Was Joon Ki a twin?
- What?

504
00:27:54,616 --> 00:27:57,753
Dong Gu, it's been a long time.
It's me, Joon Gu.

505
00:27:57,753 --> 00:28:00,230
- Lee Joon Gu.
- What?

506
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,049
Oh yes, Joon Gu.

507
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,951
Have you been doing well?

508
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:08,980
Joon Ki really had a twin brother?

509
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,221
I've never heard that before.

510
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:15,300
I see that's how he was again.

511
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,011
Joon Ki was always that way.

512
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:19,833
He didn't acknowledge that I existed.

513
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:24,691
We were born from the same womb,
but he acted like I didn't exist.

514
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:27,760
Lee Joon Ki, you're putting
on a show, aren't you?

515
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,751
You're being too harsh.

516
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,455
Who am I?

517
00:28:31,455 --> 00:28:34,231
Am I really a person who does not exist?

518
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:38,082
Our parents only acknowledged my brother,
so I lived alone my whole life.

519
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:40,832
I hated him my whole life.

520
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:42,711
I am Lee Joon Gu.

521
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:45,567
I am Lee Joon Gu and I am alive too!

522
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:55,188
Are you saying you really are
Joon Ki's twin brother?

523
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:56,544
Yes.

524
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,835
Joon Gu, be strong.

525
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:00,815
There was a situation like that.

526
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:03,433
I did not know.

527
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:06,555
No, it's all right. I'm used to it.

528
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:08,213
Why don't you sit while you're here...

529
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,704
No, it's fine. I'm in too much pain.

530
00:29:11,704 --> 00:29:14,114
I cannot stay any longer.

531
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:16,757
I think I'll get going now.

532
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:17,980
Hold on.

533
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,951
What... what is it?

534
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:26,670
- Where is Joon Ki now?
- What do you mean?

535
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,051
Joon Ki's dead.

536
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:30,455
Where is his cemetery?

537
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:31,528
We cremated him.

538
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:32,919
Then where is the charnel house?

539
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,374
We were going to
put him in a charnel house

540
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,828
but we spread his ashes instead.

541
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:40,457
Then there must be
a location where you spread them.

542
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:42,307
Tell me where.

543
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:45,577
No, why don't you just take me there?

544
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,288
I'm very busy today, so...

545
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:49,147
- Joon Gu.
- Huh?

546
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:51,396
I'm leaving the country tomorrow.

547
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:54,377
Let me say goodbye
to my friend before I go.

548
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:57,685
- Can't we do that?
- Yes, we can.

549
00:30:02,173 --> 00:30:04,067
Go on.

550
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:19,337
Hey, Joon Gu.

551
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:22,279
How far are we going?

552
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,486
Huh?

553
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:27,224
We're almost there.

554
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:30,433
It's here, right here.

555
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:32,903
Here? Over here?

556
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:34,580
Yes, yes. Here.

557
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,404
Well, then...

558
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:39,462
Joon Ki is here?

559
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:47,335
Joon Ki.

560
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:56,001
Joon Ki, you punk. I'm here.

561
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:58,589
Joon Ki!

562
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:03,384
Joon Ki, you punk.

563
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:11,628
Joon Ki.

564
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,640
Joon Ki!

565
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:20,681
Wait... are you... crying?

566
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:24,571
Actually, Joon Ki and I were very close.

567
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:27,721
He was like a brother to me.

568
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:32,000
I was angry at first
when he stole my girlfriend.

569
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,782
I eventually forgave him.

570
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:37,939
Who knew he would die
such an empty death?

571
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:44,060
I would give him a warm hug
if he were alive.

572
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,805
It hurts me so much that I can't do that.

573
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:51,002
Joon Ki!

574
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:52,659
I'm sorry.

575
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:55,981
I'm sorry, Joon Ki!

576
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,388
Rest in peace there, okay?

577
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:02,727
If I go to Heaven

578
00:32:02,727 --> 00:32:06,125
make sure to become my friend there.

579
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:10,683
Joon Ki, Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

580
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:14,384
Su Bong, Su Bong!

581
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,982
Why are you speaking informally suddenly?

582
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:29,403
It's me!

583
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:31,905
Your friend, Lee Joon Ki.

584
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,664
What are you talking about?

585
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:35,434
You said you were his twin.

586
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:38,355
Hey, man, since when do I have a twin?

587
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:42,536
I'm an only child,
four generations deep.

588
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:46,654
I lied because I thought
you might beat me to death.

589
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:52,280
I'm Joon Ki. I'm Joon Ki, Lee Joon Ki.

590
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:59,372
All right. Come to me.

591
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,799
What are you doing?

592
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,575
I thought you were going to
give me a warm hug.

593
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:21,698
Actually, I'm Joon Gu...

594
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,848
I'm not Lee Joon Ki...

595
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:28,058
Die!

596
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:34,109
Su Bong, Su Bong. I'm Lee Joon Gu.

597
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:37,106
<i>It's not easy to get your money back
in these cases.</i>

598
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:39,317
<i>It's nearly impossible.</i>

599
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:48,775
Doo Shik, what do I do?

600
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:50,445
What should I do now?

601
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,694
I have no money at all.

602
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,824
I've been cast out
from the modeling world.

603
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,224
You can start over now.

604
00:33:58,566 --> 00:33:59,986
Start over with what?

605
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:03,365
I'm not good at anything and
I don't even have a college degree.

606
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:06,396
Never mind. Why bother talking to you?

607
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:08,905
You just write strange web novels.

608
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:11,590
- What about it?
- Is that being successful?

609
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,237
Aren't you embarrassed
in front of others?

610
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:15,545
Why should I worry about
what others think?

611
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:19,135
Others might think
my work isn't much to look at.

612
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:22,275
I'm happy because
I'm doing something I like.

613
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:26,135
Su Ah, everyone has
a different standard for happiness.

614
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:31,362
So, you should find out
what makes you happy.

615
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:33,755
How can I start over at this age?

616
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:36,784
I'm 29 years old... 29.

617
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,556
Why is 29 a lot?

618
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:40,815
Do you know what
the average life expectancy is lately?

619
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:42,394
It's 80 years.

620
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:44,474
If life were a baseball game

621
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:46,382
you'd only be in
the bottom of the third inning.

622
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:48,954
Would you give up on the game
just because you were losing then?

623
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:52,559
You could get a single, triple,
or a game-changing home run.

624
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,659
No one knows until you keep at it.

625
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,987
Isn't that right?

626
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:59,889
- But, Doo Shik...
- Yeah?

627
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,699
How many innings
are in a baseball game?

628
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:16,358
Why is it so quiet?

629
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:18,456
Did everyone leave?

630
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:23,896
<i>[Dong Gu]</i>

631
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:27,384
- Hello.
- <i>Yoon Ah, where are you now?</i>

632
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:29,983
I just got back from the academy.

633
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:31,422
<i>Oh, really?</i>

634
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:34,711
I'm cleaning the third floor.
Can you come up and help?

635
00:35:34,711 --> 00:35:37,688
Okay, I'll be right there.

636
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:06,219
Dong Gu.

637
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:12,735
Yoon Ah.

638
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,135
I think I made a mistake yesterday.

639
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:17,577
I want to officially
confess my feelings this time.

640
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:22,835
Yoon Ah, I like you. I like you a lot.

641
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:25,036
- We--
- Dong Gu, why are you doing this?

642
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:27,358
I clearly told you no yesterday.

643
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:28,601
What?

644
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:33,985
Is there something you don't like?

645
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,677
I decorated it by myself for hours.

646
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:38,849
I'll be going down now.

647
00:36:39,425 --> 00:36:41,615
Oh, Yoon Ah.

648
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:43,132
Yoon Ah.

649
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:47,592
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah, wait.

650
00:36:47,592 --> 00:36:50,443
Yoon Ah! Why are you being this way?

651
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:52,099
Is there something missing?

652
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,166
Oh, a ring!

653
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:56,565
Later, once I make money,
I'll get a pretty one--

654
00:36:56,565 --> 00:36:59,525
No matter what you do,
my answer will remain the same.

655
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:03,050
I have no intention of dating you.

656
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,014
Why?

657
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:09,706
Do you dislike me that much?

658
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:13,465
You could date me, and if you dislike me,
you can dump me then.

659
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,797
I don't have the time to date right now.

660
00:37:15,797 --> 00:37:19,538
My life, alone, is enough of a burden.

661
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,394
So don't do this, okay?

662
00:37:21,394 --> 00:37:23,217
Then I'll wait.

663
00:37:23,217 --> 00:37:25,498
I'll wait until
you have the time, Yoon Ah.

664
00:37:25,498 --> 00:37:27,438
Don't wait for me.

665
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:31,166
I said I will wait. I said I will wait!

666
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,570
But you say not to do that either?

667
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:36,963
Am I a person who's not even worth
thinking it over to you?

668
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,510
Is that it?

669
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,956
All right.

670
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:50,733
I understand how you feel, Yoon Ah.

671
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,389
I'll stop.

672
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:59,688
I will stop liking you now, Yoon Ah.

673
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:01,626
What do you mean by that?

674
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:06,159
You like her?

675
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,188
Why would you like her?

676
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:12,157
What's going on here?

677
00:38:20,068 --> 00:38:22,826
Su Bong, why are you out here?

678
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:30,101
- Follow me.
- Su Bong, what is it? What is it?

679
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:32,534
I heard everything
about how you got conned.

680
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:35,070
That's why you're living off Dong Gu.

681
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,675
- Su Bong...
- Be quiet.

682
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:39,373
Go stay with our parents.

683
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:41,411
Stay there quietly and then get married.

684
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:43,612
- Come.
- No, I'm not going.

685
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,949
Then are you going continue
leeching off Dong Gu?

686
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,054
Su Bong, I'm going start over.

687
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,489
Start what over?

688
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:55,338
You insisted on being a model
and never studied your whole life.

689
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:57,889
What are you going to start now?

690
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:00,456
Also, do you realize how old you are?

691
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:01,686
What's wrong with my age?

692
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,657
I'm only 29 years old.

693
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:04,755
What?

694
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:07,291
Su Bong. Do you know what
the average life expectancy is?

695
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:08,932
It's 80... 80.

696
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,704
If life were a baseball game...

697
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:14,081
No, if life were a UFC main event

698
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:16,581
I'd only be in the second round
out of five total rounds.

699
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:19,699
Do you throw in the towel and give up
if you're losing in the second round?

700
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:23,061
In the remaining rounds, you could get
an inside kick or rear leg kick choke.

701
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,079
Or a high kick.

702
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,447
No one knows until you try.

703
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,559
I still have three rounds left.

704
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,891
I still have plenty of time.

705
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,605
So, I'm going to start over.

706
00:39:39,605 --> 00:39:42,855
Can't you trust me this once, Su Bong?

707
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:44,842
Do you really mean it?

708
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:50,114
If you throw in the towel this time...

709
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:53,385
I'm going to give you a high kick, okay?

710
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:55,391
Yes, okay.

711
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:57,414
Thank you, Su Bong.

712
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,628
Come here. Don't cry.

713
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:16,253
Yoon Ah, you're still here?

714
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:19,601
Yes, I wanted to practice some more.

715
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:22,635
Is something the matter?
Why do you look so down?

716
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,264
Is it because of that guy from before?

717
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,121
I know you don't want to talk about this,
but it's making me worry.

718
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:38,628
He seemed like a good person.
Why did you reject him back there?

719
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:43,487
I know that he's a good person.

720
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:49,271
I know better than anyone
how good of a person Dong Gu is.

721
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:52,329
But, Hyun Joon...

722
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:56,847
I don't want to trust someone again.

723
00:40:58,152 --> 00:41:00,079
I...

724
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:03,376
don't want to get hurt again.

725
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:20,161
<i>No matter what you do,
my answer will remain the same.</i>

726
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:23,251
I have no intention of dating you.

727
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:25,277
Don't wait for me.

728
00:41:48,545 --> 00:41:50,653
Are you okay after getting
beaten up by Su Bong?

729
00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:52,114
I'm fine.

730
00:41:52,114 --> 00:41:54,373
I'm lucky he didn't kill me.

731
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:56,764
So, you guys agreed to be friends again?

732
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,264
Of course, man.

733
00:41:58,264 --> 00:42:01,541
We're even going to be friends
after death, in Heaven.

734
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,418
Here. Enjoy your meal.

735
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:06,739
It's kimchi stew. Looks good.

736
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:08,440
Thank you for the meal!

737
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,302
Dong Gu, eat.

738
00:42:14,302 --> 00:42:16,429
No. I don't feel like it.

739
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:19,614
Doo Shik, can you watch Sol for me today?

740
00:42:19,614 --> 00:42:21,871
I want to go to
Hyun Joon's kitchen and practice.

741
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:24,211
Of course. Don't worry and go.

742
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:25,987
I'll get going, then.

743
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:34,784
Don't you think Yoon Ah
goes to Hyun Joon's place often?

744
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:37,485
Do you think Yoon Ah's interested in him?

745
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:38,867
I doubt it.

746
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:40,728
Dong Gu, don't worry too much.

747
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:42,436
I'm not worried.

748
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:44,916
I decided not to care about her anymore.

749
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,597
- Just know that.
- That's good.

750
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,427
- I'm going to go.
- Where are you going?

751
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:52,148
I told you that I'm starting work on
Director Kim's film today.

752
00:42:52,148 --> 00:42:53,365
You did? When?

753
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,898
I told you. I did!

754
00:42:54,898 --> 00:42:56,360
I told you so many times!

755
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,733
Listen when I tell you! Listen, you punk!

756
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:04,485
Why does he always pick on me?

757
00:43:04,485 --> 00:43:08,074
There is no need to be sad.
Go on and eat.

758
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:11,822
<i>[I Really, Really Like You]</i>
Just eat your rice.

759
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,965
I'm so sleepy.

760
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:15,635
Where did you go this morning?

761
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,005
I didn't go anywhere.
I'm getting back from work.

762
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:21,594
All day it's events, interviews,
writing previews, and running errands.

763
00:43:21,594 --> 00:43:25,420
I've been running around all night.
I'm so tired.

764
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:33,019
Are you celebrating yourself
drinking coffee or what?

765
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:37,969
A coffee after practicing my acting.

766
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:41,833
Caffeine helps me breathe.

767
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,110
What are you doing?

768
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,420
I started doing social media.
Want to see?

769
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,217
You can have the honor.

770
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,766
Oh, that's so lame.

771
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:54,523
Why social media, all of a sudden?

772
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:57,864
A celebrity should connect with fans
over social media.

773
00:43:57,864 --> 00:43:59,050
A celebrity?

774
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,492
You have no followers.
How can you connect?

775
00:44:01,492 --> 00:44:04,057
- You're doing it alone.
- I just started. That's why.

776
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:07,693
My follower count
will grow really big soon.

777
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:11,199
Chewbacca, take a picture with me
like you're my fan.

778
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,918
No, thanks. A picture?

779
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:16,159
Hey, come on. Come over here.

780
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,711
Okay, then.

781
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:22,393
Smile. Smile, would you? Smile.

782
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,273
- One, two, three...
- I said no!

783
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:28,740
- Seriously.
- Hey, hey. Chewbacca.

784
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,135
Hey, why is she acting
like that toward me lately?

785
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,619
She has always hated you.

786
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:34,929
Right, she has.

787
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:36,849
I'd better go to my shoot.

788
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:39,349
- You're going to shoot that kids drama?
- Yes.

789
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:42,541
I have a fight scene with Aquaman.

790
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,762
How can I look cool
using the octopus ink gun?

791
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:49,552
Oh my.

792
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,945
I'll get going.

793
00:44:52,945 --> 00:44:54,550
Oh, so dirty.

794
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:57,952
He's crazy. Use the gun lots.

795
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,851
Why did my cheeks turn red then?

796
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:08,298
I'm crazy. Crazy, crazy, crazy.

797
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:13,969
Calm down, heart.

798
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:21,820
Are you okay?

799
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,721
You got a severe beating from Aquaman.

800
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,590
I'm fine.

801
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:32,603
But I really wonder
how long I have to do this.

802
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:36,692
Are you all right?

803
00:45:39,302 --> 00:45:42,184
Still, we're better off than him.

804
00:45:42,184 --> 00:45:44,952
I'm relieved not to be playing
Hairtail Fish Man.

805
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,782
Oh yeah. Did you do the audition?

806
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:48,902
Which one?

807
00:45:48,902 --> 00:45:52,532
Director Kim Jin Ho
is starting a new drama.

808
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:54,938
By Director Kim Jin Ho...

809
00:45:54,938 --> 00:45:58,063
do you mean the director
who did "Son's Revenge"

810
00:45:58,063 --> 00:45:59,757
that hit a 40 percent rating?

811
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,813
- The man who always makes a hit?
- Yes.

812
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:05,135
I went to the auditions
for that drama yesterday.

813
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:06,971
- Really?
- Yes.

814
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:09,911
Gosh, I missed out on that.

815
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:12,960
I wonder if there's a way
I can audition for him now.

816
00:46:27,594 --> 00:46:30,670
Jae Wook, Jae Wook!

817
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,762
Jae Wook.

818
00:46:32,762 --> 00:46:35,998
Why is the volume so loud?

819
00:46:35,998 --> 00:46:37,583
Jae Wook!

820
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:39,891
Jae Wook!

821
00:46:39,891 --> 00:46:42,956
Oh, Joon Ki. It's been a long time.

822
00:46:42,956 --> 00:46:44,452
What brings you by?

823
00:46:44,452 --> 00:46:49,248
I heard you're the assistant director
on the new drama by Kim Jin Ho.

824
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:52,239
- Help me get an audition.
- What?

825
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,021
- Why are you shouting?
- What?

826
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:58,271
I can't hear you. Speak up!

827
00:46:58,271 --> 00:47:00,463
Why are you yelling?

828
00:47:00,463 --> 00:47:02,552
Ah, sorry!

829
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:05,760
I was filming an explosion scene!

830
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,860
I injured my ear!

831
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,489
Really? Are you okay?

832
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:15,840
Yes, I'll be okay soon with treatment!

833
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,989
Oh yeah. What were you saying?

834
00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:24,478
Help me get an audition
with Director Kim Jin Ho!

835
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:27,472
The auditions are over for that!

836
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:29,179
I know that!

837
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,572
Talk to the director for me!

838
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:34,076
Ask him to give me an audition!

839
00:47:34,076 --> 00:47:36,510
It will be hard because he's busy!

840
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,550
I have to yell again.

841
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,650
Hey, Kang Seo Jin.

842
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,474
Oh, Joon Ki.

843
00:47:42,474 --> 00:47:44,717
Ah, are you here for a story?

844
00:47:44,717 --> 00:47:46,612
Yes, I am.

845
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,447
Wow, you really seem like a reporter now.

846
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:58,568
Hey, what's with you?

847
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,103
What's with her?

848
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:06,856
Does she hate me that much?

849
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:12,664
Jae Wook! Help me out with the audition!

850
00:48:12,664 --> 00:48:15,925
- Okay, I'll talk to him!
- Really?

851
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:18,724
But, I have a favor to ask too!

852
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:22,155
Tell me. I'll do anything!

853
00:48:23,978 --> 00:48:28,534
Gosh, I haven't showered in three days.
I feel so dirty.

854
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:33,461
So, have you looked into who could
play the role of the Saudi?

855
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:37,300
It's hard to find an Arab actor
who can act and speak Korean.

856
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,342
<i>[Hyun Joon, Hyun Joon, Hyun Joon]</i>
That's a problem. It's a crucial role.

857
00:48:40,342 --> 00:48:42,090
What is he up to anyway?

858
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,260
Kang Dong Gu, do you have an idea?

859
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,201
Hyun Joon!

860
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:47,686
You shocked me.

861
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:49,858
Hyun Joon? What do you mean, Hyun Joon?

862
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:50,889
What?

863
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,947
Ah, Shin Hyun Joon.

864
00:48:52,947 --> 00:48:57,800
So, put makeup on Shin Hyun Joon
and cast him as the Saudi.

865
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,215
Isn't it a bit hard for Shin Hyun Joon
to pull off being Arabian?

866
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:05,235
It's fun. It's an original idea.

867
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:08,215
- Contact Shin Hyun Joon.
- Yes, Director.

868
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:09,875
- Kang Dong Gu.
- Yes?

869
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:12,489
Great idea. You always had
a good sense for things.

870
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:14,619
- Good job.
- Thank you.

871
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,476
Must be nice.
I was thinking of Shin Hyun Joon too.

872
00:49:17,476 --> 00:49:19,251
- Huh?
- You said it before I could.

873
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:21,503
Sorry, man.

874
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:33,016
I said I'd buy you something better.
Why are we eating spicy rice cakes?

875
00:49:33,016 --> 00:49:34,978
What about it? They're good.

876
00:49:34,978 --> 00:49:38,327
I think they're even better
because you bought them for me.

877
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:42,547
Still, you let me use your kitchen
and teach me techniques.

878
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:44,675
I really wanted to buy you a nice meal.

879
00:49:44,675 --> 00:49:47,967
No, spicy rice cakes are enough for me.

880
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:52,684
Is this really enough?

881
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:54,958
It really was good.

882
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:04,074
Oh, my back!

883
00:50:04,074 --> 00:50:07,128
Oh no. Are you okay, Hyun Joon?

884
00:50:07,128 --> 00:50:08,387
I'm sorry.

885
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:10,119
What? Hey, you!

886
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:14,954
- Try getting up. Try.
- Okay.

887
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:17,440
Oh, I'm so tired.

888
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,117
I've been running around all day.
I'm so tired.

889
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:25,164
I need to sleep.

890
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:28,552
I need sleep.

891
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:36,400
<i>[Joon Ki]</i>

892
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,483
What?

893
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:39,753
Seo Jin, do you have some free time now?

894
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:41,318
- Why?
- <i>Why else?</i>

895
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:43,063
I'm going to buy you food.

896
00:50:43,063 --> 00:50:45,001
So, come on out now.

897
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:48,963
Where are you? Okay.

898
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:55,012
Gosh, why is this guy making me tired
and then telling me to come out?

899
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:02,878
Oh, how tiresome.

900
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:08,565
I'll go just this once. How annoying.

901
00:51:29,742 --> 00:51:32,472
- I'm here.
- Oh, you're here?

902
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:35,644
Why did you suddenly call me out?

903
00:51:35,644 --> 00:51:37,525
I'm tired from working all night.

904
00:51:37,525 --> 00:51:41,675
Well, I have a favor to ask of you.

905
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:43,759
A favor? What favor?

906
00:51:43,759 --> 00:51:47,465
Well... oh, Jae Wook. Over here.

907
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,789
Who's this?

908
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:58,130
Ah, he's a PD I know at the station.

909
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,280
Oh, say hello to each other.

910
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,349
This is my friend's little sister,
Kang Seo Jin.

911
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:07,677
He is a PD at JBC station,
Kim Jae Wook.

912
00:52:07,677 --> 00:52:10,230
Yes, hello.

913
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,744
Hello!

914
00:52:11,744 --> 00:52:15,882
My name is Kim Jae Wook
and it's nice to meet you!

915
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,693
That scared me.

916
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:19,547
Why is he screaming?

917
00:52:19,547 --> 00:52:22,117
He hurt his ear while shooting.

918
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:25,797
He'll recover soon. Don't worry.

919
00:52:25,797 --> 00:52:29,389
Jae Wook, your voice
is too loud right now!

920
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:32,699
Tone it down. Tone it down!

921
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,943
Sorry. I'm sorry.

922
00:52:36,692 --> 00:52:39,469
Why is he here right now?

923
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:42,628
Ah, he saw you earlier and liked you.

924
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:45,322
He wanted to be set up with you.

925
00:52:46,393 --> 00:52:48,108
Set up?

926
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:51,637
Joon Ki, let's talk for a moment.

927
00:52:54,248 --> 00:52:56,224
What are you doing here?

928
00:52:56,224 --> 00:52:58,070
Why would you do this without telling me?

929
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:02,891
- I'm going.
- Hey, how can you just leave?

930
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:07,141
Honestly, there's an audition
I really want to do.

931
00:53:07,141 --> 00:53:09,664
He's the assistant director on that team.

932
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:14,630
He said he could make it happen for me
if I set him up with you.

933
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:20,110
Don't you feel bad for me
always playing an octopus?

934
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,500
Seo Jin, do me this favor once.

935
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:26,786
Just this once.

936
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,954
Okay.

937
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:32,547
But I'm only going to eat dinner.

938
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:35,599
Thank you. Thank you so much, Seo Jin.

939
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,072
I'll get going, so please do well.

940
00:53:38,072 --> 00:53:39,510
Good luck!

941
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:46,826
That jerk.

942
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:51,692
Seo Jin, what would you like to eat?

943
00:53:53,224 --> 00:53:57,557
I'll just have the Gorgonzola pizza
and carbonara spaghetti.

944
00:53:57,557 --> 00:54:00,449
What? I can't hear you!

945
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:04,027
Can you tell me once more, loudly?

946
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:09,025
The Gorgonzola pizza
and carbonara spaghetti!

947
00:54:09,025 --> 00:54:13,226
Ah! The Gorgonzola pizza
and carbonara spaghetti!

948
00:54:13,226 --> 00:54:15,244
What would you like to drink?

949
00:54:15,244 --> 00:54:18,565
- Grapefruit juice!
- Oh, grapefruit juice?

950
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:20,400
Over here. We're ready to order!

951
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,740
We heard everything!

952
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,063
Our chef has already started cooking.

953
00:54:25,063 --> 00:54:26,092
Yes.

954
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:28,452
How embarrassing.

955
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:30,690
- I'll be in the restroom.
- Pardon?

956
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:33,108
I'll be in the restroom!

957
00:54:33,108 --> 00:54:34,831
Yes, sure!

958
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:36,298
Go on and relieve yourself!

959
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:41,099
I'm home.

960
00:54:41,813 --> 00:54:42,934
Oh, you're home?

961
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:46,471
How was it working on a film
after so long?

962
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,902
It was very hectic.

963
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:50,885
What is this?

964
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:52,692
What's this smell?

965
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,045
They're socks, socks.

966
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:02,077
The director doesn't have time to
do laundry, so it's my job to do it.

967
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:06,248
Where's Yoon Ah that you're watching Sol?

968
00:55:06,248 --> 00:55:09,012
Yoon Ah left this morning
and hasn't returned.

969
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:12,161
What? Still? Look at the time.

970
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:14,601
Why? Are you worried?

971
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:16,469
I thought you weren't
going to care anymore.

972
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:19,594
Who said I was worried?

973
00:55:19,594 --> 00:55:22,186
I was just hungry. I'm hungry.

974
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:24,338
Oh, it's Yoon Ah.

975
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,139
Yes, Yoon Ah.

976
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:29,880
Really? Okay, then.

977
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,422
I understand. Okay.

978
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:35,730
Was that Yoon Ah? What did she say?

979
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,215
She says she might be late.

980
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,547
She's at that guy Hyun Joon's place.

981
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:43,206
He hurt himself and his son is sick,
so she needs to help him out.

982
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:47,155
So, the two of them are alone in a house?

983
00:55:47,155 --> 00:55:48,829
This late at night?

984
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:51,697
What if something happens between them?

985
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:55,177
- Dong Gu must be worried.
- Stop it.

986
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:59,152
What are you talking about?
Why would I worry?

987
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:01,976
I think I'll get some sleep.

988
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,532
Oh, yes. Hello, Director.

989
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,742
The socks?

990
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:14,219
Yes, I'll be there right away.

991
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:16,617
Gosh, this man.

992
00:56:16,617 --> 00:56:18,711
What? What is it?

993
00:56:18,711 --> 00:56:21,275
The director is going
hunting for locations to shoot.

994
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:25,563
He has these location hunting socks
he wears when he goes. He wants them.

995
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:29,831
Gosh, at this late hour too.
I'll be going.

996
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:33,972
Location hunting socks?

997
00:56:33,972 --> 00:56:36,052
- Does that exist?
- I don't know.

998
00:56:36,052 --> 00:56:38,278
Maybe they help him find a place.

999
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:40,340
Why aren't they picking up?

1000
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:43,367
Why isn't anyone
at the academy picking up?

1001
00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:48,101
Why are the lights off?

1002
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:50,280
Why isn't anyone here?
Why isn't anyone here?

1003
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,726
What's going on here?

1004
00:56:51,726 --> 00:56:54,242
Song Hyun Joon. Where is he?

1005
00:56:54,242 --> 00:56:56,407
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah.

1006
00:56:56,407 --> 00:56:58,407
Why are the lights off?

1007
00:56:58,407 --> 00:57:01,152
What's going on here?

1008
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:03,737
Song Hyun Joon. Where is he?

1009
00:57:03,737 --> 00:57:06,349
- Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah.
- Hey.

1010
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:10,391
All of the classes are over.
What are you doing here?

1011
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:14,277
Do you happen to know Instructor
Song Hyun Joon's home address?

1012
00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:16,199
- Why do you need that?
- What?

1013
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,786
Ah, that's because...

1014
00:57:19,844 --> 00:57:21,512
I have a package for him.

1015
00:57:21,512 --> 00:57:23,434
There's a delivery for Song Hyun Joon.

1016
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:24,697
Let me see that.

1017
00:57:24,697 --> 00:57:28,824
Oh, yeah. His name was
written here somewhere.

1018
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,195
Hold on. It was definitely here.

1019
00:57:31,195 --> 00:57:34,295
His name should be right here.

1020
00:57:34,295 --> 00:57:38,164
Oh, it's on this side.

1021
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,065
<i>[To: Song Hyun Joon]</i>
Song Hyun Joon. Yes.

1022
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:41,719
I see that it's a package.

1023
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:44,150
Where is the address though?

1024
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,514
So many people just
write a name these days.

1025
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:49,641
So, please give me his address.

1026
00:57:49,641 --> 00:57:52,360
I can't give you
his personal information.

1027
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,458
You can leave it with me
and I'll give it to him tomorrow.

1028
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:58,735
No, it's an urgent delivery.

1029
00:57:58,735 --> 00:58:00,927
I have to get it to him right away.

1030
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:03,856
I think it may be food.

1031
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:06,865
I think it's already rotting. See.

1032
00:58:06,865 --> 00:58:08,985
- It smells rotten.
- Oh my.

1033
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,525
I think it's very expensive.

1034
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:14,246
Whatever, then. Do it your way.

1035
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:19,179
If it rots and becomes useless,
you can be held responsible.

1036
00:58:20,996 --> 00:58:22,510
Hey, wait.

1037
00:58:25,554 --> 00:58:26,556
What is it?

1038
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,780
Who is it?

1039
00:58:32,731 --> 00:58:34,909
Oh, Yoon Ah!

1040
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:36,541
Oh, Dong Gu.

1041
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:38,981
Why are you in my director's place?

1042
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:41,648
What do you mean, director?
This is Hyun Joon's home.

1043
00:58:41,648 --> 00:58:44,528
That can't be.

1044
00:58:44,528 --> 00:58:48,969
I came to run an errand for the director.

1045
00:58:48,969 --> 00:58:52,726
Did he give me the wrong address?
What happened?

1046
00:58:52,726 --> 00:58:54,755
Who is it?

1047
00:58:54,755 --> 00:58:57,358
- Well...
- Oh my!

1048
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,773
Hello, we briefly met
each other before, right?

1049
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:03,664
Yes. Hello.

1050
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:05,612
So, you live here?

1051
00:59:05,612 --> 00:59:08,822
It seems rude of me to just leave.

1052
00:59:08,822 --> 00:59:12,143
I think I should come in for tea.

1053
00:59:12,143 --> 00:59:15,844
Dong Gu, didn't you say
you had an errand to run?

1054
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,242
Ah, right.

1055
00:59:20,405 --> 00:59:22,534
Yes, Director.

1056
00:59:22,534 --> 00:59:26,894
What? You don't need
the location hunting socks?

1057
00:59:26,894 --> 00:59:30,094
Ah, yes. I see.

1058
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:32,733
He is always changing his mind.

1059
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:35,603
I came out,
but now he doesn't need them.

1060
00:59:35,603 --> 00:59:39,492
Since things turned out this way,
I'll stay for tea.

1061
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,028
Yes, yes. You should.

1062
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:45,092
Yes, Doo Shik. What?

1063
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:49,661
All right, I'll go there now. Okay.

1064
00:59:49,661 --> 00:59:52,425
Dong Gu, Sol won't stop crying.

1065
00:59:52,425 --> 00:59:54,144
I think I need to go.

1066
00:59:54,144 --> 00:59:57,007
Can you stay here for a bit?

1067
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,144
What? Me... me?

1068
00:59:59,144 --> 01:00:02,574
Hoon is sick, and as you can see,
Hyun Joon is not well either.

1069
01:00:02,574 --> 01:00:04,007
Please help me out.

1070
01:00:04,007 --> 01:00:07,983
Wait, Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah...

1071
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,672
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1072
01:00:40,672 --> 01:00:42,721
Why is Dong Gu at his home?

1073
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:45,572
I guess the director and Hyun Joon
live in the same building.

1074
01:00:45,572 --> 01:00:48,882
Dong Gu pressed Hyun Joon's bell
thinking it was the director's home.

1075
01:00:48,882 --> 01:00:51,217
- We ran into each other by chance.
- Really?

1076
01:00:51,217 --> 01:00:55,061
What a strange coincidence that could
only happen once in a thousand years.

1077
01:00:55,061 --> 01:00:58,940
It must be very awkward being
with a person he doesn't know.

1078
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,686
Leave him alone. Leave him alone.
What would happen?

1079
01:01:03,516 --> 01:01:07,043
Why are you so excited about that
social media account with no comments?

1080
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:09,376
What? I do get comments.

1081
01:01:09,376 --> 01:01:11,623
A big fan of mine writes comments.

1082
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,489
I'm in a good mood. Look.

1083
01:01:19,403 --> 01:01:22,119
"Joon Ki, stay strong.
Your acting is the best."

1084
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:24,862
What is this? It's real.

1085
01:01:24,862 --> 01:01:27,045
The user ID is "Joonki_love."

1086
01:01:27,045 --> 01:01:29,894
- Yeah.
- My goodness.

1087
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:33,938
I guess the world is big
and full of crazy people.

1088
01:01:33,938 --> 01:01:36,389
What? You're just jealous.

1089
01:01:36,389 --> 01:01:39,150
I don't want to talk
to a person with no fans.

1090
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:43,086
<i>You have arrived at your location.</i>

1091
01:01:43,086 --> 01:01:46,239
What was that?
Who turns their navigation on that loud?

1092
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,173
<i>Seo Jin, I had fun today!</i>

1093
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:50,246
<i>Go on in now!</i>

1094
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:52,760
- <i>Thank you for the ride!</i>
- What was that?

1095
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,110
- <i>Drive home carefully!</i>
- Isn't that Seo Jin?

1096
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,728
Why is she shouting?

1097
01:01:57,728 --> 01:02:00,791
There's a reason for that.

1098
01:02:01,735 --> 01:02:03,389
Seo Jin, you're home?

1099
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,887
Hey, Seo Jin. Seo Jin.

1100
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:17,956
Seo Jin, what is it?
Did something happen?

1101
01:02:17,956 --> 01:02:21,128
Can't you see?
I thought my eardrums would explode.

1102
01:02:21,128 --> 01:02:24,259
Hold on a bit.
He's getting treatment right now.

1103
01:02:24,259 --> 01:02:27,148
- He'll be fine after.
- Forget it.

1104
01:02:27,148 --> 01:02:29,336
I went on this date,
so that's enough, right?

1105
01:02:29,336 --> 01:02:33,521
Wait, Seo Jin.
My audition's in a few days.

1106
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:35,210
Couldn't you see him until then?

1107
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,661
No way.

1108
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:38,653
Really?

1109
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:41,869
What can I do, then?

1110
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:44,208
I'll forget about the audition, then.

1111
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:48,648
I'll regret it forever
if that drama becomes a hit.

1112
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:56,282
I guess I'll live as an octopus forever.

1113
01:02:56,282 --> 01:02:58,722
All right, all right!

1114
01:02:58,722 --> 01:03:02,771
But it's only until the audition.

1115
01:03:04,423 --> 01:03:07,356
Seo Jin, thanks. Thank you so much.

1116
01:03:07,927 --> 01:03:09,077
Let go.

1117
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:11,978
Rest up. Get some good rest.

1118
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:20,800
That jerk.

1119
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,844
Gosh, this is so awkward.

1120
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:37,554
Do I have to stay with him all night?

1121
01:03:39,873 --> 01:03:44,458
It's okay. I have you guys.

1122
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:47,864
<i>Excuse me. Dong Gu, Dong Gu!</i>

1123
01:03:47,864 --> 01:03:50,983
What? Why is he calling for me?

1124
01:03:59,929 --> 01:04:01,016
What is it?

1125
01:04:01,016 --> 01:04:02,838
I'm sorry to ask.

1126
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:05,974
Could you come in and help me?

1127
01:04:10,153 --> 01:04:11,367
What is it?

1128
01:04:12,802 --> 01:04:14,449
What are you doing, huh?

1129
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:16,257
Why do you have your pants off?

1130
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:22,307
Well, I barely managed to get
my pants off and see to my business.

1131
01:04:22,307 --> 01:04:25,067
But I just can't stand on my own.

1132
01:04:26,246 --> 01:04:29,356
And? Why did you call for me? Why?

1133
01:04:30,672 --> 01:04:35,094
Could you... help me up?

1134
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,188
What? You want me to help you up?

1135
01:04:38,188 --> 01:04:40,668
While you're in that state?

1136
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:44,038
I just cannot get up on my own.

1137
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:46,853
All right.

1138
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:51,025
Just put your hand out,
just your hand.

1139
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:53,481
- I've done that.
- Slowly now.

1140
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:55,922
- Your hand. This side too.
- Okay.

1141
01:04:55,922 --> 01:04:57,769
Okay, don't touch me with your body.

1142
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,867
Don't touch me!

1143
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:01,992
Ah, you got up?

1144
01:05:01,992 --> 01:05:03,809
- You're up?
- Yes.

1145
01:05:03,809 --> 01:05:05,750
Oh, thank you.

1146
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:09,108
- It's fine.
- Wait, Dong Gu.

1147
01:05:09,108 --> 01:05:10,751
What, what?

1148
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:13,076
I'm sorry to ask again.

1149
01:05:14,228 --> 01:05:18,744
Could you pull my pants
and underwear up too?

1150
01:05:18,744 --> 01:05:21,708
I can't bend at my waist.

1151
01:05:23,172 --> 01:05:24,789
All right.

1152
01:05:27,418 --> 01:05:29,985
I'm doing all sorts of crap.

1153
01:05:29,985 --> 01:05:33,204
- This is too much.
- I'm sorry.

1154
01:05:33,204 --> 01:05:35,583
I'm very sorry.

1155
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:39,731
Oh no. I saw it it. I saw it!

1156
01:05:39,731 --> 01:05:42,581
Why didn't you cover it with a towel?

1157
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:44,818
You have no manners, seriously.

1158
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:47,452
Oh no! Oh my.

1159
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:50,458
I saw it again! Why did you fall?

1160
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:53,894
I pulled you up.
Seriously, why are you doing this?

1161
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:04,695
I wonder if Dong Gu is all right.
Should I give him a call?

1162
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:08,208
I'm home.

1163
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,905
Dong Gu, you're just getting in?

1164
01:06:12,905 --> 01:06:14,936
How's Hoon? Is he okay?

1165
01:06:14,936 --> 01:06:17,675
- Yes.
- What a relief.

1166
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:20,545
It was uncomfortable
with Hyun Joon, wasn't it?

1167
01:06:21,976 --> 01:06:24,106
Did something happen?

1168
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:25,952
What?

1169
01:06:26,826 --> 01:06:30,005
No, nothing happened at all.

1170
01:06:30,005 --> 01:06:34,487
Yoon Ah, I'm very mentally exhausted.

1171
01:06:34,487 --> 01:06:36,019
I'm going to sleep.

1172
01:06:42,954 --> 01:06:44,914
What's wrong with him?

1173
01:06:44,914 --> 01:06:47,224
Did they fight?

1174
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:50,074
<i>No! This isn't right.</i>

1175
01:06:50,074 --> 01:06:52,166
<i>This isn't right!</i>

1176
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,322
What was it?

1177
01:07:03,202 --> 01:07:06,213
It's bad. So salty!

1178
01:07:06,213 --> 01:07:08,534
How come you can't
cook ramen at your age?

1179
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:10,766
- Don't eat it.
- It's good. It's good.

1180
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:12,469
- I'll eat it.
- Then shut up and eat it.

1181
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:14,215
<i>You've arrived at your location.</i>

1182
01:07:14,215 --> 01:07:15,706
What's that again?

1183
01:07:15,706 --> 01:07:18,092
Seo Jin must be home.

1184
01:07:18,092 --> 01:07:21,768
She'll lose her hearing
when she's with him.

1185
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,668
Chewbacca, what are those flowers?

1186
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:31,347
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1187
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:33,920
Go ask her.

1188
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,293
Hey, Chewbacca.

1189
01:07:37,731 --> 01:07:40,141
What is that? What are the flowers for?

1190
01:07:40,141 --> 01:07:41,481
Are they from Jae Wook?

1191
01:07:41,481 --> 01:07:43,873
Wow, things must be going well.

1192
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:45,623
He asked me to officially date him.

1193
01:07:45,623 --> 01:07:48,931
- Really?
- What should I do?

1194
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:51,070
Should I date him?

1195
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:53,224
You should if you like him
and you shouldn't if you don't--

1196
01:07:53,224 --> 01:07:54,331
Joon Ki.

1197
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:57,242
- Let me ask you one thing.
- Hm?

1198
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,927
Do you...

1199
01:08:00,891 --> 01:08:02,596
not see me as a woman?

1200
01:08:03,672 --> 01:08:05,722
What does that suddenly mean?

1201
01:08:05,722 --> 01:08:08,753
I see you as a man, Joon Ki.

1202
01:08:08,753 --> 01:08:10,204
What should I do?

1203
01:08:10,894 --> 01:08:13,443
Hey, of course I'm a man.
Then, am I a woman?

1204
01:08:13,443 --> 01:08:15,574
Not in that way...

1205
01:08:15,574 --> 01:08:17,009
I...

1206
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:21,011
think I like you, Joon Ki.

1207
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:25,416
What?

1208
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:27,671
I said I like you, Joon Ki.
