1
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,285
I'll start cleaning up again.

2
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:17,780
You! Dong Gu!

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,025
That's why you ran out after hearing about the fire? And the coat...

4
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:25,195
So the person you like is actually Yoon Ah...

5
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:26,495
and not me?

6
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:27,965
What?

7
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:31,135
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:33,400
Don't try to deny it. Ye Rin told me everything.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,505
What?

10
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:37,600
She said she'd keep it a secret. She told you already?

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,775
I...

12
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:44,715
Dong Gu. Did Ye Rin arrive home safely?

13
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,415
Pardon?

14
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:50,455
My goodness. I can't believe this.

15
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:52,795
This sure is big news.

16
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:56,995
Soo Ah. What's the matter? Is something wrong?

17
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,860
So you see, it wasn't me...

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,490
that Dong Gu likes. It's actually...

19
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,290
Oh, dear. Soo Ah.

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,375
Come here. Let's go outside.

21
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:06,845
What was that about?

22
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:08,745
What's wrong with them?

23
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,345
- Gosh, I can't breathe. - I'm sorry.

24
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:19,255
So do you really like Yoon Ah?

25
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,685
Why did you pretend as if you liked me?

26
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,985
I...

27
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,080
didn't want Yoon Ah to notice.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,155
What?

29
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:28,250
Have you been using me...

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,690
to hide your love for Yoon Ah?

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,095
Well, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

32
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,990
Soo Ah, can you keep this...

33
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,975
a secret for a while?

34
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:38,975
- Why? - I...

35
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,905
I'm just not sure about myself yet.

36
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:44,015
Please keep this a secret.

37
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:47,115
Soo Ah, I beg you.

38
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:51,240
- Gosh, all right. Stop it. - Really?

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,550
Sure, I get it. Just leave.

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,985
All right. I'm going.

41
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,390
But Soo Ah,

42
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,290
can you give this coat to Yoon Ah?

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,720
- This was meant for her. - What?

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,905
She's really weak and catches cold easily.

45
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:10,360
- But her coat is so thin and... - All right.

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,000
All right. I'll give it to her. Okay?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,005
Thank you, Soo Ah. I knew I could count on you.

48
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,515
What on earth?

49
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:22,745
That somehow hurt my pride.

50
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:24,955
Gosh, I can't believe this. Gosh.

51
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:32,255
(A Secret You Can't Tell)

52
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,495
I didn't know I'd come back here on my own will.

53
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,095
Gosh.

54
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:54,485
- Yes, sir. - Mr. Bong.

55
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:57,080
When are you planning to pay back Mal Geum's deposit?

56
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,140
I'm sorry. It won't take long.

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,510
I'll prepare the money.

58
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,595
So please don't say anything to Mal Geum about this.

59
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,655
Please, I ask you...

60
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,165
Hello? Hello? Sir!

61
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,365
Darn it.

62
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,545
Gosh.

63
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,440
You're spending more on the pain relief patches than what you earn.

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,580
You're never going to get the money for Mal Geum's deposit.

65
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,890
Then what should I do? I need to try at least.

66
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:38,655
Does she know what you're doing?

67
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:39,855
She doesn't, does she?

68
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:42,150
Just ask her out.

69
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,135
I need to pay for her deposit first.

70
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,990
Du Shik, someone's here for you.

71
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,765
Me? Who?

72
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,405
Mal Geum.

73
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:02,310
She's the first love you talked about, right?

74
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:04,115
What? Yes.

75
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:08,850
Where's the milk?

76
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:09,985
Wait.

77
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:12,180
Hey, that's mine.

78
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,765
Mal Geum likes cafe latte.

79
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:15,090
Gosh.

80
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,060
You were dying until just now.

81
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,295
Look at him now.

82
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:22,930
The power of love is amazing.

83
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,375
Sure, the power of love is amazing.

84
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:28,605
- Don't you think so too, Dong Gu? - What?

85
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,005
I don't know.

86
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,740
Yoon Ah, take this.

87
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,310
What? Why are you giving it to me?

88
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,440
You should wear it.

89
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,115
It's too small for me to wear.

90
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,820
But it was a present from Dong Gu. I can't.

91
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
It's fine. He doesn't care.

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,565
- Right, Dong Gu? - What?

93
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:51,195
No, I don't.

94
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,565
You shouldn't refuse. You should wear it.

95
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:58,175
Soo Ah and I are just friends.

96
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:01,605
Right. We're just friends.

97
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:04,275
He's probably in love with someone else.

98
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:06,575
Pardon?

99
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,650
Anyway, you should take it.

100
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,350
Why would you throw it at her?

101
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,080
I wanted to give it to her nicely.

102
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,390
But if I go within 1m of Sol,

103
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,850
she starts crying.

104
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,190
That doesn't make sense.

105
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,295
Do you want to see for yourself?

106
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:28,665
Why would you make her cry?

107
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,805
- What was that? - Oh, my.

108
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,915
She already knows how to separate good and evil at a young age.

109
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:39,840
She's a genius.

110
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:42,085
You're the demon, and she's a genius.

111
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:47,710
Jun Ki, what did you say just now? Do you want to die?

112
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,485
I must have gone out of my mind.

113
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,325
These pictures remind me of the old days.

114
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,495
You and I always used to hang out together.

115
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:01,390
By the way, when did you start to like me?

116
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,565
What?

117
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,235
What... What are you talking about?

118
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:08,530

You liked me, didn't you?

122
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,370
When did this happen? Am I your first love?

123
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,840
No, no. This is...

124
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,240
Du Shik, here are your patches...

125
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,925
I didn't know you had a visitor. Who is she?

126
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,025
She's my friend.

127
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,120
Your friend?

128
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,090
The first love you were talking about?

129
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,190
Hey!

130
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:31,060
What are you talking about? It's not like that.

131
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,060
Get out. Go.

132
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,905
All right. I will.

133
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:36,765
I even bought you pain relief patches. Gosh.

134
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:39,035
Get out.

135
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:41,945
- Have a nice time. - Hey!

136
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:49,085
Why do you need pain relief patches? Are you hurt?

137
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:52,155
It's nothing. I hurt myself while working at the construction site.

138
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:53,755
Construction site?

139
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:57,220
What? Right. Well, a friend of mine needed help,

140
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,455
so I went to help him out a little.

141
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,725
Are you doing that for me?

142
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:03,350
Is it for the deposit?

143
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,035
No, I took care of it already.

144
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:08,530
- Really? - Yes.

145
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,660
You don't need to worry.

146
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,635
Just focus on your auditions.

147
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,445
I can't even work anymore because of the cold.

148
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:26,255

Cold?

157
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:52,500
We can catch a cold if we want to.

00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:19,795
Stop crying and play with this.

185
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:23,190
It's so cool.

186
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,160
Babies like sounds like that.

187
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,435
They have keen sense of hearing.

188
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,230
Thank you so much. You saved me.

189
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,200
It's all right. I did nothing.

190
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,475
Thank you.

191
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,845
- Bye. - Thank you.

192
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:39,615
Let's go.

193
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:45,395
Dad, what are you staring at?

194
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,025
Nothing. She reminds me of myself in the past.

195
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:54,265
When you were a baby, I was just like that.

196
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,690
I didn't know anything, so I was confused and flustered.

197
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,575
I don't think it's just that.

198
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:03,605
Dad, did you fall in love at first sight?

199
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:10,285
Where are Jun Ki and Du Shik?

200
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:12,955
Du Shik is sick with a cold.

201
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:15,685
Jun Ki must be doing something crazy somewhere.

202
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:17,795
Are you in a hurry?

203
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:19,955
Why are you eating while standing up?

204
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,825
I must eat when I have time.

205
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:23,065
Why?

206
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:27,665
That's why.

207
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:34,145
It's a problem that Sol always wants to stay with Yoon Ah.

208
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:37,475
That's why Yoon Ah can't sleep and struggles all day.

209
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,015
Really?

210
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:45,855
What kind of outfit is that?

211
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,250
Where were you?

212
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,485
- I went out for a walk. - A walk?

213
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:51,495
In this cold? In that outfit?

214
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:52,880
I have to catch a cold.

215
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,150
You have to catch a cold?

216
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,430
What do you mean?

217
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:56,850
Can you explain?

218
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,520
For a clinical research part-time job,

219
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,630
I need to catch a cold.

220
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,490
- What's a good way to catch a cold? - He lost his mind.

221
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,675
Gosh, it hurts.

222
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,335
That's a good idea.

223
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:09,645
What are you doing?

224
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:11,515
Why did you take my candy?

225
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:13,315
It's because I need to catch a cold.

226
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:16,085
That's so dirty. You won't catch a cold that way.

227
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,420
It won't work, right?

228
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:18,655
Take it back.

229
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:20,480
Gosh.

230
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,725
I need something that guarantees catching a cold.

231
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,465
Oh, this may work.

232
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:30,960
Why are you giving me a dirty look?

233
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,020
- What? - Yes.

234
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,005
I have the perfect idea.

235
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:35,665
Du Shik.

236
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:37,935
Let's kiss.

237
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:40,035
What... Kiss?

238
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:41,445
Are you out of your mind?

239
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:42,730
No, stay away from me.

240
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,870
I've never done it. Stay away.

241
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,900
- Stay away. - It's okay.

242
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,470
- It'll be over soon. - Stay away, lunatic.

243
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,345
- I've never done it. - Hey.

244
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:51,515
Come here. It'll be quick.

245
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,915
- What are you doing? - Come here.

246
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:15,905
Sol.

247
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,075
Where is your mom?

248
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:20,945
What's going on?

249
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,875
What is happening here?

250
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:30,645
Dong Gu, Yoon Ah. Wake up.

251
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,890
Why didn't you sleep in the room?

252
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:42,125
What?

253
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:46,795
After I put Sol to sleep, I fell asleep while reading.

254
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,565
Why were you sleeping here, Dong Gu?

255
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,135
Especially next to Yoon Ah?

256
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:57,005
Well, what happened was...

257
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:02,185
My head hurts. I drank so much last night.

258
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:05,815
I didn't realize that I fell asleep here. Really.

259
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:09,450
- I'm hungover. - Stop drinking so much.

260
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:11,255
Don't you feel sorry for your liver?

261
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,480
Aren't you hungry?

262
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,850
I'll prepare breakfast.

263
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,765
- I'll help you. - Okay.

264
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:18,120
Take care of Sol, Dong Gu.

265
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,165
Good morning, Sol.

266
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:24,005
Did you sleep well?

267
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,005
Excuse me.

268
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,610
Hot water, please.

269
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,215
One moment.

270
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:41,650
What are you doing, Yoon Ah?

271
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,285
Pardon? What do you mean?

272
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:45,855
My goodness.

273
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:47,865
It's so hot.

274
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:51,595
- Are you okay? - Are you okay, Yoon Ah?

275
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:53,635
I'm okay.

276
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:58,035
I'm sorry. I'm all over the place.

277
00:14:58,405 --> 00:14:59,500
Listen.

278
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,070
You're on vacation from now on.

279
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,730
Don't do anything.

280
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,600
Go out, and do everything that you wanted to do.

281
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,285
- What? I'm okay. - No.

282
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:11,215
Do as I tell you. Won't you listen to the boss?

283
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,455
But...

284
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,610
What are you doing? Go out now.

285
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,410
He's right. You should get some rest.

286
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,980
But still...

287
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,350
Take a break. Go on.

288
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,725
"Bye, Mom."

289
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:28,590
It's all done.

290
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,765
Press it down until the bleeding stops.

291
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:34,505
Please take this medicine at 9 o'clock sharp.

292
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:35,845
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:40,075
Du Shik, this is such an easy job.

294
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,145
I can do this forever.

295
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:44,440
All it takes is drawing blood, taking medicine,

296
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,840
and lying down all day, and it pays 2,000 dollars.

297
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,985
- It's a piece of cake. - I know.

298
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:56,665
(Mal Geum)

299
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,595
Isn't it Mal Geum?

300
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,405
Why aren't you picking up?

301
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:06,135
I don't want her to worry.

302
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:09,545
Why would she worry when it's an easy job?

303
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:16,970
Sol, your mom is taking the day off today.

304
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,715
Let's have fun, okay?

305
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:23,385
You're trying hard, aren't you?

306
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:25,155
You even take care of her baby.

307
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:27,925
You were self-centered when we were together.

308
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:30,025
You changed a lot.

309
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:32,435
No, I didn't.

310
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:36,465
What is it, Sol?

311
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,335
Do you want some too?

312
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:41,005
This isn't for you.

313
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,015
You can't eat it.

314
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:46,975
No way.

315
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,940
Sol, I gave you abalone porridge.

316
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,825
Stay seated for a while, okay?

317
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:57,185
Isn't it great? I know.

318
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,625
Where are the photos from the birthday party?

319
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:04,995
It's time for your medicine.

320
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:07,395
Again? That's quite often...

321
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:11,335
- What's wrong with my voice? - It sounds...

322
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,600
What's wrong with my voice?

323
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:16,145
Did my cold get worse?

324
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,345
Hey, hey.

325
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:24,355
Don't I sound sexy?

326
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,285
Du Shik.

327
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,150
We haven't lied down in a while.

328
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,755
Don't. Stop it.

329
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:34,950
You sound sexy.

330
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,725
Stop it.

331
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,235
Excuse me.

332
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,995
Take the medicine.

333
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:42,530
Okay.

334
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,165
I don't want to take medicine.

335
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:46,560
Shall I feed you, or will you take it?

336
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,830
Give me a kiss.

337
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,005
Oh, my goodness.

338
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,445
Oh, my goodness.

339
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:05,855
I'm so tired.

340
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:10,895
Until when do I have to take photos of first birthday parties?

341
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,895
I miss the movie industry.

342
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:16,565
- What are you doing? - Can't you see?

343
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:19,500
I'm editing birthday videos while drinking coffee.

344
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,170
Really? Where's Sol?

345
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,805
Sol is right here.

346
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:25,975
Where's Sol?

347
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:27,375
Where is she?

348
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:29,110
What? Sol.

349
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,555
Why would Sol be there?

350
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:32,940
Where's Sol?

351
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,525
Can't you see that I'm looking for her?

352
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:35,785
Where's Sol?

353
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:37,010
Sol.

354
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,220
- Sol. - Sol.

355
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:40,220
Sol wouldn't be in here, would she?

356
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,550
- Sol. - Sol.

357
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,050
- Hey. - Where are you, Sol?

358
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,150
Sol.

359
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,720
Where are you, Sol?

360
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,020
Peekaboo.

361
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,605
Where are you, Sol?

362
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:50,965
Are you here? No.

363
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,735
Sol?

364
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:57,105
Sol!

365
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:59,275
Where could she be?

366
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:01,810
What are you going to do?

367
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,115
- What if something happened to her? - I'm worried sick too.

368
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,285
How can I find her?

369
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,395
Come on.

370
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,920
Is this your amazing idea of finding Sol?

371
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,370
Sol cries when Soo Ah is within 1m range.

372
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,100
This will be a quicker way to find her.

373
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:28,705
Are you looking for water source?

374
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,005
Am I some radar?

375
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:32,140
Aren't you being too harsh to me these days?

376
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,100
We have to do everything to find her.

377
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,345
Spread your arms wider.

378
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:37,545
That's good. Here we go.

379
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,125
To the left.

380
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:45,155
Sol.

381
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:51,125
Isn't that the sound of Sol crying?

382
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:56,730
Look.

383
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,460
There's nothing here.

384
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,245
I'm sure I heard something.

385
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,330
- Could she be on the bed? - How could that be possible?

386
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,975
How could she get on a bed by herself?

387
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:07,985
Here she is.

388
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,345
- My goodness. - What?

389
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:13,415
How could she have gotten here by herself?

390
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:15,510
Does this make sense? How could this possibly make sense?

391
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,960
That's not important. What's important is that we found her.

392
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:20,750
Sol. How did you get on the bed?

393
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,290
Do you know how worried I was?

394
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:24,935
It's a relief nothing serious happened.

395
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:30,290
Hold on. Why are her cheeks so red?

396
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,935
Sol. Let me check real quick.

397
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:35,605
- She has a fever. - What?

398
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:39,215
You're right. What could be the problem?

399
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,145
Sol.

400
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:45,240
Mr. Lee Jun Ki and Mr. Bong Du Shik, please wake up.

401
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,715
I need to draw blood from you two.

402
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,885
Again? All right.

403
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:56,825
What's going on? What's wrong with my voice?

404
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,235
Gosh. What's wrong with your voice?

405
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:00,995
Wait. What's wrong with my voice?

406
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,065
What's going on?

407
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:05,235
What's wrong with their voices?

408
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:07,535
What's going on? My voice is strange also.

409
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:11,740
Me too.

410
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:14,100
Goodness. What's going on? Something must be wrong.

411
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,570
Oh, dear. Doctor!

412
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,245
Gosh. What's going on?

413
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,515
What's wrong with my voice?

414
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:21,925
This is driving me crazy.

415
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:26,395
Check, check.

416
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:29,025
Electronic

417
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:30,425
Argentina

418
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:35,165
Can anyone please save us?

419
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:38,000
Ma'am. Can I have one serving of sundae?

420
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,835
- Wait one moment, please. - All right.

421
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:45,475
Hello.

422
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:49,610
You're the person that comforted Sol, right?

423
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,655
Yes. So we meet again.

424
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,140
Where's that cute baby?

425
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,285
Why are you here alone?

426
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:57,995
The father must be babysitting today, right?

427
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:01,125
No. She doesn't have a father. I raise her on my own.

428
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:03,025
I see.

429
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:07,320
The babysitter's watching Hoon. I'm free for a change.

430
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,835
I see. Then are you and your wife out on a date for a change?

431
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:14,535
No. My wife died six years ago.

432
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,140
Come to think of it, we haven't introduced ourselves yet.

433
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,840
My name is Song Hyun Joon.

434
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:22,345
My name's Han Yoon Ah.

435
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:24,210
It's a pleasure to meet you again, Yoon Ah.

436
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,615
Likewise, it's nice to meet you.

437
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:28,925
By the way, there's something...

438
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:31,795
- on your sweatshirt. - What?

439
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,995
It must've been Sol.

440
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:38,195
I see. It must've been the baby that did it.

441
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,930
Gosh. You can't imagine how much Hoon vomited as a baby.

442
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,765
I didn't have a single piece of decent clothes.

443
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:46,575
Excuse me.

444
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:50,745
Yes, Seo Jin. What is it?

445
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,875
What?

446
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,670
Sol's sick?

447
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,415
All right. I'll be right there. All right.

448
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:01,140
Why? Is something wrong?

449
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,710
Apparently, Sol's sick. I'll have to get going.

450
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,855
All right.

451
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,935
Sol. Sol.

452
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:15,465
What's wrong with Sol?

453
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,975
You see, apparently, she has the stomach flu.

454
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,160
The stomach flu? How could she all of a sudden?

455
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,945
She was fine this morning.

456
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:24,900
She must've eaten something by mistake.

457
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
I didn't feed her anything.

458
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,370
You all know I can't go near her within 1m.

459
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,645
That can't be possible.

460
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:34,015
You see, actually, I did feed her something.

461
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:36,185
What did you feed her?

462
00:23:36,255 --> 00:23:38,695
A little bit of hot dog bun.

463
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,180
Hot dog bun?

464
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,850
You see, I didn't mean to give her any at first,

465
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,135
but the look in her eye seemed so earnest.

466
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:49,190
It was organic bread though.

467
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,265
Then you're saying that was all you fed her, right?

468
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:55,270
I also fed her a little bit of ham and abalone.

469
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,930
What? Ham and abalone?

470
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,100
It was abalone porridge to be exact.

471
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,300
Are you crazy?

472
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,445
How could you feed a baby ham and abalone?

473
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:06,440
How could you be so thoughtless?

474
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,485
I'm sorry. I thought it was okay.

475
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:13,195
I'm really sorry, Yoon Ah.

476
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:16,825
That's all right.

477
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:19,335
I should've told you. It's my fault.

478
00:24:21,065 --> 00:24:23,090
Sol. I'm sorry.

479
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,235
I shouldn't have left you at home.

480
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:27,635
I'm sorry.

481
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:33,700
Gosh. I can't believe this.

482
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,945
I've never heard of this kind of side effect.

483
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:39,015
What if we lose our voices forever?

484
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,015
I know. That worries me.

485
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:44,385
Those jerks. How could they develop such useless medicine?

486
00:24:44,825 --> 00:24:46,955
- Let's just hurry and go home. - All right.

487
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:48,925
Taxi.

488
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:51,195
- Taxi. Taxi. - Taxi.

489
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:58,635
Mister. Can you take us to Huam-dong?

490
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:00,700
Huam-dong.

491
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,205
Waikiki Guesthouse.

492
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:07,275
What's wrong?

493
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:10,845
I see. It must be because of our voices.

494
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:13,440
Mister. We're not playing games with you.

495
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,110
We took part in a clinical test.

496
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,010
This is a side effect from the medicine.

497
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,655
He's right. This isn't a joke. He's telling the truth.

498
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:24,935
What's the matter?

499
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:29,405
What's the matter, sir?

500
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,500
I'm serious. This is a side effect. We're not playing with you.

501
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,935
Don't play games with me, you jerks.

502
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:35,505
You're imitating me.

503
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,705
I know you guys are teasing me.

504
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,080
I'll kill you two.

505
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:41,145
I'll make sure I kill you guys.

506
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:44,855
- Run! - Come here!

507
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:46,855
- Run! - Run!

508
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:02,365
What are you doing?

509
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:04,835
You're here.

510
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,660
Go ahead. Go in.

511
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,305
I want to,

512
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:12,875
but I can't face Yoon Ah and Sol. I feel so bad.

513
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:18,255
I don't know why I'm such an idiot.

514
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:23,085
Dong Gu. Can I ask you something?

515
00:26:23,555 --> 00:26:24,610
What is it?

516
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,595
It's about you liking Yoon Ah.

517
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:30,125
You've already considered her situation and Sol, right?

518
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:31,860
What is that supposed to mean?

519
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,895
You know well that Yoon Ah's situation isn't normal.

520
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,265
She even has Sol.

521
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:39,435
You're sure you can deal with all her issues, right?

522
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:45,615
You don't mean to say you've never thought about this, do you?

523
00:26:47,545 --> 00:26:49,645
It may not be any of my business,

524
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,680
but if you're not confident about taking responsibility,

525
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,315
don't even get started in the first place.

526
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:57,755
It's tough enough for her as it is.

527
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:07,495
You said it would be a few days. Why are you home so early?

528
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:09,865
What about that part-time job? Are you guys finished?

529
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:15,405
Did you guys earn some money?

530
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,375
How much did you earn?

531
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,770
- Gosh, what are you guys saying? - Ouch.

532
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,140
What was that for? Why did you hit me?

533
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,115
What's going on? What's wrong with your voice?

534
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,485
You see, it's a side effect from the medicine.

535
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:34,390
This is all your fault.

536
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:35,850
Where did you find such a horrible part-time job?

537
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,950
Did I ever ask you to come with me? Did I?

538
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,720
You came voluntarily. Why are you blaming me?

539
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,360
What? How dare you raise your voice at me?

540
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,790
What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong?

541
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,090
You introduced me to that job. Look at what happened to my voice.

542
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,835
What on earth is going on?

543
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:47,960
I can't believe these two.

544
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,445
- How dare you talk to me that way. - Leave me alone!

545
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:55,845
(Mal Geum)

546
00:27:55,915 --> 00:27:57,085
- It's Mal Geum. - What?

547
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,915
I can't answer her call with this voice. What should I do?

548
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:03,185
Seo Jin. Please answer this for me.

549
00:28:04,655 --> 00:28:05,795
Give it to me.

550
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,025
Hello?

551
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:13,435
Yes. This is Du Shik's cell phone. He's gone to the restroom.

552
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:16,265
If you leave a message, I'll pass it on to him.

553
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:19,975
I see. All right.

554
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:22,670
- What did she say? - She said she has to talk to you.

555
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,375
She's here. She wants to see you.

556
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:27,300
I wonder what it is. What could it be about?

557
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,045
Maybe she's here to tell you that she likes you.

558
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:31,570
What?

559
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,840
Don't be ridiculous. That can't be possible.

560
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,085
I know you'd like that.

561
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:37,910
You seem to be looking forward to it.

562
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,780
You're acting coy.

563
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,455
- It's so obvious. - Stop it.

564
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:44,225
I think I'll just follow you and go watch.

565
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:53,275
I'm sorry to have called you out with such short notice.

566
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:57,605
There's something I wanted to tell you.

567
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:01,145
You see,

568
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:03,745
I...

569
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,940
agreed to work with my agent again.

570
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,085
What?

571
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:10,985
What is that supposed to mean all of a sudden?

572
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:13,795
Du Shik. What's wrong with your voice?

573
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,225
I have a cold.

574
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,865
You're working with your agent again? What do you mean?

575
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:26,335
Are you saying you'll do adult movies again?

576
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:27,735
No.

577
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:31,700
He's planning a drama with a production company in China.

578
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,475
He said he'd give me a role in that drama.

579
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:36,245
I'll be going to China because of that.

580
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:38,315
- When? - Tomorrow.

581
00:29:38,685 --> 00:29:41,715
I'm leaving on short notice because of the shooting schedule.

582
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:43,185
That quickly?

583
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:48,355
Mal Geum. Did you hear about something from your agent?

584
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,725
What about?

585
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:53,935
Do you mean how you said you'd pay for my contract fee?

586
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:56,805
I already knew about that.

587
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,735
I knew you were working part-time because of me.

588
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:02,305
But I pretended not to notice.

589
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,575
I wanted to escape no matter what.

590
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:08,585
Are you working with him again because of money?

591
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,970
Mal Geum, I can get you the money.

592
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,515
- So, you... - No.

593
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,185
It's not just because of the money.

594
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:16,185
I want to.

595
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:19,655
Here, no matter how hard I try,

596
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,325
I can't do anything because of what I did in the past.

597
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:26,395
That's why I want to start over at a place where no one knows me.

598
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:31,035
Do you really need to go?

599
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:34,500
Can't you just stay?

600
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:36,305
It's a great opportunity for me.

601
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:39,275
I don't want to miss this, Du Shik.

602
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:44,745
You're going to support me, right?

603
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:51,185
Thank you. I really wanted your support.

604
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:53,555
By the way,

605
00:30:54,425 --> 00:30:56,125
while packing,

606
00:30:56,135 --> 00:30:58,635
I found some pictures I took with you.

607
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:09,305
Du Shik, thank you for everything.

608
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:11,205
Thanks a lot.

609
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:15,385
I'll get going.

610
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:17,045
Take care.

611
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:41,835
Why did you draw a heart here?

612
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,470
She's my first love.

613
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,915
(Yoon Mal Geum)

614
00:32:07,265 --> 00:32:08,565
Mal Geum.

615
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:11,265
No.

616
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:17,505
Sol, you're all right now, aren't you?

617
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,775
You got a stomachache because of that crazy man, didn't you?

618
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:22,245
Gosh.

619
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:24,815
You must be out of your mind.

620
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:26,940
We're still breast feeding her.

621
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,150
How can you give ham and abalone to her?

622
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,455
Stop it. He didn't know.

623
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:33,080
It's fine, Dong Gu.

624
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,425
Sol is fine now.

625
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:37,325
Come here, Sol.

626
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:40,965
You're all right now, Sol.

627
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:43,965
I know I might sound nosy,

628
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:46,135
but if you can't bear the situation Yoon Ah is in,

629
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,635
you shouldn't start anything in the first place.

630
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:51,975
She's already got plenty of wounds.

631
00:32:52,185 --> 00:32:54,075
Would I be able to take care of her?

632
00:32:54,545 --> 00:32:57,245
I can't even take care of Sol properly.

633
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:01,085
- Do you like it? - I can't even look after myself.

634
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:03,985
What's this?

635
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:08,625
He's the one who caused the problem. Why is he acting like the victim?

636
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:13,995
You look well-rested.

637
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:17,390
How can someone looking for her job take naps regularly like that?

638
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,040
I've been preparing for interviews all night. It was a short nap.

639
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:21,130
How about you?

640
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,045
You call yourself an actor, but you go after weird part-time jobs.

641
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:26,275
What? Weird part-time jobs?

642
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:30,245
I just sacrificed myself for the development of medicine.

643
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:32,540
You should quit looking for jobs...

644
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,250
and participate in clinical trials instead,

645
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,010
like a depilatory for women.

646
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,310
Not many women can grow a beard.

647
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,480
So rough.

648
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,520
You little...

649
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,050
Do you want to die? Do you?

650
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,425
You're killing me.

651
00:33:44,095 --> 00:33:45,995
Jedi. Help me, Jedi.

652
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:47,890
Stop it.

653
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,590
How can you fight every time you see each other?

654
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,235
Let them be. That's how people grow close.

655
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:54,160
What? Grow close?

656
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,245
How can you say that?

657
00:33:56,675 --> 00:33:59,100
He's the worst man I've ever seen...

658
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,540
in my life.

659
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:02,770
Even if I were to be left alone on a deserted island with him,

660
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,455
- I wouldn't go out with him. - Me neither.

661
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,840
If I were to be left alone on a deserted island with you,

662
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,510
I'd rather live with the sea turtle,

663
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,010
not you.

664
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,020
Sea turtles can't grow a beard.

665
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,280
It's smooth.

666
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,180
That sea turtle just told me...

667
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,150
that it hates losers like you.

668
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,550
- What? Loser? - What?

669
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,195
You!

670
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:22,765
Gosh.

671
00:34:24,835 --> 00:34:26,535
- It's mine. - Gosh.

672
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,300
Why did you buy the same phone? It's confusing.

673
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,500
I bought it first.

674
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,470
Gosh, there's not even one thing I like about you.

675
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,910
- I'm crazy in love with you - What's that?

676
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,125
What's that?

677
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:45,595
I'm waiting for you

678
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:49,325
I have nothing special

679
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:54,620
But I still want you

680
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,765
Why does he even want to sing in that voice?

681
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,035
You should try to understand him.

682
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:01,205
Mal Geum is departing today.

683
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:03,945
The side effect lasts really long.

684
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:06,400
He did take the medicine consistently.

685
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,375
To find you

686
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:11,870
I know that you are the only one

687
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,415
Dong Gu, tell him to stop.

688
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:21,490
So I really want you

689
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:24,950
Love me

690
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,430
Don't make me cry

691
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:30,960
I want to say this

692
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,730
More often than I breathe

693
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,630
But I don't have the confidence

694
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,270
I'm a coward

695
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:48,540
That always hides

696
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,985
What's wrong with him?

697
00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:54,155
No one in this family is sane.

698
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:57,750
- Love me - Love me

699
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,890
- Don't make me cry - Don't make me cry

700
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,530
- I want to say this - I want to say this

701
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,830
- More often than I breathe - More often than I breathe

702
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,110
- Du Shik. - Dong Gu.

703
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:13,315
I'm a coward too.

704
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:15,175
Dong Gu.

705
00:36:15,815 --> 00:36:18,170
I'm a coward too.

706
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,440
("My Gangster Lover")

707
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,815
Mal Geum.

708
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:23,825
I'm Kang Ji Won from Seoul District Prosecutor's office.

709
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:26,655
Do you want to follow me quietly, or do you want me to make a scene?

710
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:28,055
It's your choice.

711
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,825
But if you want to make a scene,

712
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:33,395
you should risk your lives.

713
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:35,505
What are you doing?

714
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,165
Can't you see?

715
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:39,035
What are you this time?

716
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,435
I'm a prosecutor.

717
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:44,100
I'm a passionate prosecutor...

718
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,700
that punishes gangsters.

719
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,970
A prosecutor? With that face?

720
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,445
You're not the gangster?

721
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:51,270
The director must be clueless.

722
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,155
Chewbacca, you shouldn't talk to me like that.

723
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,085
I'm going to have ramyeon now.

724
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,485
Why can't you be supportive?

725
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:02,625
Why isn't the gas working?

726
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:04,995
- I... - Jun Ki, can you take a look?

727
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,695
You only ask kindly when you need my help.

728
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:09,390
Take a look.

729
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,165
Why isn't this working?

730
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:13,560
It works perfectly.

731
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,735
Move.

732
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:17,775
Why isn't this working?

733
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:22,100
Let me take a look.

734
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,745
That's weird. The gas valve is on.

735
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:28,015
Jun Ki!

736
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:32,695
Darn it, what is this?

737
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:37,125
My face was near the stove.

738
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:39,400
How could you turn the gas on?

739
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:40,695
I'm sorry.

740
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:43,530
I didn't know it would work all of a sudden.

741
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:45,435
What did you think would happen?

742
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:49,045
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

743
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:52,915
I need to work later today. How can I go to work like this?

744
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:55,785
What's wrong, Dong Gu?

745
00:37:55,955 --> 00:37:57,245
Do you have something on your mind?

746
00:37:57,685 --> 00:37:58,880
Let him be.

747
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,840
He always tries to look cool.

748
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,750
You're such a snob.

749
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,280
Stop it.

750
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,855
I'm not feeling well.

751
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:10,825
What's wrong with your eyebrow?

752
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:12,795
Did you wax it?

753
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,120
Your eyebrow...

754
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,065
Stop laughing. Stop!

755
00:38:17,135 --> 00:38:18,665
It's all because of your sister.

756
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:19,935
Stop laughing!

757
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:25,340
- What's that? - These are plastic models.

758
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,515
Plastic models?

759
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:29,270
Your voice became normal again.

760
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,110
It started coming back this morning.

761
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:32,680
What's with the plastic models?

762
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,715
No reason. I was feeling sad and...

763
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:42,125
What's with the eyebrow? Gosh.

764
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:44,525
Stop laughing. Stop!

765
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,995
You were nearly dying just now.

766
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:50,705
Why did you buy plastic models if you're feeling sad?

767
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:54,435
I feel like making these would help me organize my thoughts.

768
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,030
Yes.

769
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,375
Let me help, Du Shik.

770
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:01,040
I have a lot on my mind too.

771
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:02,945
All right.

772
00:39:03,315 --> 00:39:05,615
Isn't that face so funny?

773
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,615
It is.

774
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:10,650
Just shave off the other side too.

775
00:39:10,655 --> 00:39:12,420
Are you Harvey Dent or what?

776
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:13,695
Stop laughing!

777
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:21,160
Have you ever done this before?

778
00:39:21,165 --> 00:39:23,590
This is more difficult than you think.

779
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,375
It's not like anyone can do this.

780
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:27,735
What?

781
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:31,005
It would only take a quarter of a day to finish this.

782
00:39:31,545 --> 00:39:32,640
Really?

783
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,210
Once you open the box, you can't eat anything...

784
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:38,145
or go to sleep until you are finished with it.

785
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:39,455
Will that be okay with you?

786
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:42,040
If you think you'll give up midway,

787
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,650
you'd better give up now.

788
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,120
I would never do that.

789
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:49,825
If you're unsure about yourself, you should quit yourself.

790
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:53,760
Shall we start?

791
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:54,995
Shall we?

792
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:01,935
Soo Ah, how does it look?

793
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,800
You look silly with eyebrow makeup.

794
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,275
What? Silly?

795
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:08,245
Darn it.

796
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:12,580
How about this, Soo Ah?

797
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,640
You look silly with tape.

798
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,985
"Silly with tape"?

799
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:19,055
Goodness.

800
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:22,525
Nothing works out because of Seo Jin.

801
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:26,835
(You're no exception from hair loss.)

802
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:29,765
Jun Ki.

803
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:32,700
Call them, and ask if they have fake eyebrows.

804
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,135
Are you teasing me?

805
00:40:34,705 --> 00:40:37,330
You're making it worse than it already is.

806
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,575
Never mind then.

807
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:40,275
Here it is.

808
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:41,900
Seo Jin.

809
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,570
What will you do about this?

810
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,470
How can I go to the shoot like this?

811
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,315
I said that I'm sorry.

812
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:48,840
I'm going to my interview.

813
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,950
Hey.

814
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:51,210
How can you go...

815
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,620
to an interview when you ruined my face?

816
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,125
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

817
00:40:55,595 --> 00:40:56,725
See you.

818
00:40:56,835 --> 00:40:58,095
(Selling all types of wigs)

819
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:01,465
- Wait, Seo Jin. - What?

820
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:10,545
Good luck on your interview.

821
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:12,615
I'm always cheering for you.

822
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:14,840
Good luck.

823
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:18,170
Oh, thank you. I'll do my best.

824
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,315
High five.

825
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:22,115
Thanks.

826
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:35,095
It's your turn next. Brace yourself.

827
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:37,090
(New Hire Interviews)

828
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,405
Lastly, why do you want to be a reporter?

829
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:44,745
I believe that reporters can change the world.

830
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:48,440
I'll correct the wrong with my articles.

831
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,685
By being the voice of the weak,

832
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:54,515
I want to make the world a better place.

833
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:58,320
That's the reason why I want to be a reporter.

834
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:00,755
I see. Thank you.

835
00:42:00,925 --> 00:42:03,825
- We'll give you a call. - Thank you.

836
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:09,765
Ms. Kang Seo Jin?

837
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:12,805
Yes, what is it?

838
00:42:14,805 --> 00:42:16,475
You have something on your back.

839
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:21,170
Why was it on my back?

840
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,650
What's this? "You're no exception from hair loss."

841
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:26,185
"Prepare before it's too late."

842
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:29,255
Did you bring this for me?

843
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,580
No, I didn't. I really didn't.

844
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,025
Okay, you should get going.

845
00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:41,195
Why was this...

846
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:44,135
Wait.

847
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:46,905
I'm always cheering for you. Good luck.

848
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:49,205
Is that why he...

849
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:52,975
Jun Ki, that crazy jerk.

850
00:42:58,385 --> 00:43:01,010
Are you kidding me?

851
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,085
What happened to your face?

852
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:05,625
Where's your eyebrow?

853
00:43:07,325 --> 00:43:09,550
- I'm sorry. - That's not good enough.

854
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,920
You don't look like an elitist prosecutor.

855
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,460
Can I get some special makeup?

856
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,165
Do you know how much that costs?

857
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:17,860
My goodness.

858
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,905
It's such a ridiculous thing to worry about before shooting!

859
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:24,375
Wait a minute.

860
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:31,810
I have an idea.

861
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:32,915
Pardon?

862
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:37,710
I'm Kang Ji Wan from Seoul District Prosecutors' Office.

863
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,925
Will you follow me, or do you want to fight?

864
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:41,280
You choose.

865
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,725
If you want to fight, your life will be at risk.

866
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:46,965
Shut it, you punk.

867
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:51,065
I don't care if you're a prosecutor. If you move an inch...

868
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,735
Cut, cut.

869
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:56,430
What are you doing?

870
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,370
Is that the best acting you've got?

871
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:02,970
You look creepier than anyone else. How can you say the lines like that?

872
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,045
I'm sorry, sir.

873
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:06,315
It's because my role changed so suddenly.

874
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:09,285
I'll do it again.

875
00:44:09,555 --> 00:44:10,825
Let's go again.

876
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:14,195
This is all because of Seo Jin, that wench.

877
00:44:22,905 --> 00:44:24,635
(You're no exception from hair loss.)

878
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:27,305
Wait, and see when he gets home.

879
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:32,205
- Hey. - Jun Ki.

880
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:34,600
You did this, didn't you?

881
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,110
Do you know what happened at my interview because of this?

882
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:40,640
I was yelled at during the shoot and lost my role because of you.

883
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,315
I already apologized for it.

884
00:44:42,355 --> 00:44:44,855
Do you know how important today's interview was?

885
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:47,720
Will you take responsibility if I get rejected?

886
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,620
What? Listen.

887
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,890
Take responsibility of my eyebrow.

888
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,595
What did you say?

889
00:45:04,275 --> 00:45:05,575
What's wrong, Seo Jin?

890
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:08,445
What does it say?

891
00:45:09,385 --> 00:45:11,485
(We cannot offer you a position at this time.)

892
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:19,550
Hey! Hey!

893
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,125
What did the message say?

894
00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:23,325
Seo Jin...

895
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:25,725
didn't get the job.

896
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,535
- What? - Really?

897
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:30,335
Why did you pull such a prank?

898
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:31,590
What?

899
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,635
It isn't my fault.

900
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:36,905
I'm also a victim.

901
00:45:38,515 --> 00:45:39,675
Darn it.

902
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:41,015
Gosh.

903
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:44,170
What do we do about Seo Jin?

904
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,415
What can we do? What's done is done.

905
00:45:48,785 --> 00:45:51,985
Are they still working on that?

906
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:54,625
They didn't eat all day.

907
00:45:55,395 --> 00:45:56,825
Aren't they hungry?

908
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,035
I'm hungry.

909
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:10,305
My lower back and eyes hurt terribly.

910
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:14,075
I'm too tired to calm my mind.

911
00:46:14,345 --> 00:46:16,045
I can't even think.

912
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,915
Isn't he tired?

913
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,215
Persistent jerk.

914
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:22,925
I'm tired.

915
00:46:23,555 --> 00:46:26,925
I'm so tired that instead of calming my mind,

916
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:29,125
my body is numb.

917
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:32,325
Why is he completely fine?

918
00:46:32,805 --> 00:46:34,195
Persistent jerk.

919
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:36,765
Du Shik.

920
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,130
How much have we done?

921
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,560
Are we almost finished?

922
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,100
I'm not sure. Shall we take a look?

923
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,245
Shall we?

924
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:51,415
What? There's so much left.

925
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:52,610
Darn it.

926
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:54,210
Goodness.

927
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,380
When will we ever finish it?

928
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,985
I'm so tired.

929
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:05,525
Du Shik.

930
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:08,335
I can definitely continue,

931
00:47:08,605 --> 00:47:12,065
but it's time for "Men on a Mission".

932
00:47:12,435 --> 00:47:14,860
I never miss that show.

933
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,070
I'm a huge fan. Want to watch it together?

934
00:47:17,075 --> 00:47:19,970
Please say yes.

935
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,315
Let's take a break for at least one hour.

936
00:47:23,415 --> 00:47:26,515
I can do it all night,

937
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:29,885
but I'm also a huge fan of "Men on a Mission".

938
00:47:30,455 --> 00:47:33,050
I'll continue after watching...

939
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,355
the show.

940
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:36,590
Thank goodness.

941
00:47:36,595 --> 00:47:38,720
I don't care what the show is,

942
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,495
but let me take a break first.

943
00:47:41,865 --> 00:47:44,160
Where are you going? Did you finish already?

944
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,265
No, not yet.

945
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:48,735
It just happens that "Men on a Mission" is on today.

946
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:50,000
I'm a huge fan.

947
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,075
Me too. I never miss that show.

948
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,800
I'm part of Seo Jang Hoon's fan club.

949
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,240
- Right. - I'm serious.

950
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,380
Really?

951
00:47:57,385 --> 00:47:59,615
"Men on a Mission" is canceled today.

952
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,395
Really?

953
00:48:08,395 --> 00:48:11,525
Since "Men on a Mission" is canceled,

954
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:13,520
we should restart right away.

955
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,665
Right.

956
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:17,535
"Men on a Mission" is canceled today.

957
00:48:18,335 --> 00:48:19,835
We should continue.

958
00:48:27,285 --> 00:48:28,815
Where's Dong Gu and Du Shik?

959
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:31,810
They didn't come to the room last night...

960
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,010
because of that plastic model.

961
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,715
Are they still working on it?

962
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:37,480
They're more tenacious than I thought.

963
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,385
They must have a lot on their minds.

964
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:41,425
I feel bad for them.

965
00:48:45,895 --> 00:48:47,095
Where's Seo Jin?

966
00:48:47,365 --> 00:48:48,690
She's not hungry.

967
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:52,105
She's crying all day under her blanket. I'm worried.

968
00:48:53,675 --> 00:48:55,330
You should apologize to her first.

969
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,770
Why should I? Hey, I'm the victim.

970
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,000
Don't you see my eyebrow?

971
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,015
Come on, you were harsh.

972
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:03,945
Let her win this time.

973
00:49:03,955 --> 00:49:06,915
She's right. Seo Jin is crying so much.

974
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,240
Fine.

975
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,385
She's such a crybaby.

976
00:49:28,205 --> 00:49:29,805
Aren't you going to eat?

977
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,805
Leave. I don't want to talk.

978
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:38,585
I'm sorry, Seo Jin.

979
00:49:38,885 --> 00:49:42,015
I didn't think you'd go all the way to the interview with it.

980
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,550
Don't stay upset like this.

981
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,350
Leave me alone.

982
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,720
Can't you accept my apology?

983
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,325
Besides, it's not completely my fault that you didn't get an offer.

984
00:49:53,065 --> 00:49:54,365
I know.

985
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:57,090
I know that it isn't completely your fault.

986
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,535
Then what's wrong?

987
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:01,370
It's not your first time getting rejected.

988
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,605
This was...

989
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:05,000
my last interview.

990
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,745
What do you mean...

991
00:50:06,845 --> 00:50:08,175
that it was your last?

992
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:11,545
I made up my mind to give up and look for other jobs...

993
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:14,115
if I get rejected this time.

994
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:16,985
Now that I got rejected,

995
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:19,185
I feel terrible.

996
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:24,765
So mind your own business and leave.

997
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:27,195
Just leave me alone.

998
00:50:49,695 --> 00:50:51,555
Hey, guys.

999
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,290
What are you doing?

1000
00:50:53,295 --> 00:50:55,880
Sleep in your room. Why are you sleeping here?

1001
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,665
Who's sleeping?

1002
00:50:57,835 --> 00:50:58,990
Me?

1003
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,195
Not me.

1004
00:51:00,465 --> 00:51:04,705
I was only blinking slowly.

1005
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:09,260
It must be Du Shik who slept.

1006
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,405
I didn't.

1007
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:12,605
I was thinking...

1008
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:15,415
about how to assemble them better.

1009
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:18,245
It's true. I fell asleep.

1010
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,215
I had the best sleep ever.

1011
00:51:20,485 --> 00:51:24,155
I woke up just before entering REM sleep.

1012
00:51:25,695 --> 00:51:27,995
I want to sleep comfortably in bed.

1013
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:31,525
He'll look down on me If I suggest that we go to sleep.

1014
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:33,665
My goodness.

1015
00:51:34,105 --> 00:51:35,465
I want to sleep.

1016
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:37,935
I can't keep my eyes open.

1017
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:40,435
Should I just sleep?

1018
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:44,730
Then he'd look down on me...

1019
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,145
and keep teasing me.

1020
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:47,675
What should I do?

1021
00:51:55,255 --> 00:51:57,450
Gosh, what should I do?

1022
00:51:57,455 --> 00:51:59,180
What's wrong?

1023
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,625
Look at this.

1024
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:04,795
My fingers got glued together.

1025
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:09,200
My goodness.

1026
00:52:09,205 --> 00:52:10,860
My fingers got glued too.

1027
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,960
What's wrong with that?

1028
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,760
When assembling a plastic model,

1029
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,605
the thumb and the index finger are necessary.

1030
00:52:18,645 --> 00:52:21,515
But since they're glued together,

1031
00:52:21,615 --> 00:52:24,710
I can't assemble it even if I want to.

1032
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,945
I know.

1033
00:52:25,985 --> 00:52:27,515
It's unfortunate,

1034
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:30,625
but what can I do with my fingers like this?

1035
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:33,620
I wanted to finish it,

1036
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:36,095
but unfortunately, this must be the end.

1037
00:52:36,995 --> 00:52:38,790
Do you really want to finish it?

1038
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,065
Of course.

1039
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:41,560
That's obvious.

1040
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,535
Don't worry. I have acetone.

1041
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:46,365
Acetone removes glue right away.

1042
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:47,700
I'll separate them.

1043
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,405
With acetone?

1044
00:52:49,715 --> 00:52:51,445
No way.

1045
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:53,770
The glue is very strong.

1046
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,115
There's no way that acetone will work.

1047
00:52:56,315 --> 00:52:58,585
It'll take a long time.

1048
00:52:59,315 --> 00:53:01,885
It won't be easy to separate.

1049
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:07,255
- Du Shik. - Mine too?

1050
00:53:14,735 --> 00:53:16,665
See? Wasn't that quick?

1051
00:53:16,705 --> 00:53:18,470
You can assemble as much as you want.

1052
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:19,835
Acetone.

1053
00:53:24,745 --> 00:53:27,545
Shut it, you punk.

1054
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:30,370
I don't care if you're a prosecutor. If you move an inch,

1055
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:31,985
I'll make you pay.

1056
00:53:33,185 --> 00:53:34,855
I'll make you pay.

1057
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:39,185
That wench.

1058
00:53:39,865 --> 00:53:41,925
I can't concentrate on acting.

1059
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:49,420
- Hello? - Hello.

1060
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,390
Is this Kang Seo Jin's phone?

1061
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,535
Pardon? "Kang Seo Jin"?

1062
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,875
What?

1063
00:53:56,845 --> 00:53:59,175
I took her phone again.

1064
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:02,240
What is it?

1065
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,810
You have your second interview at Joyoung Daily.

1066
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:08,920
Yesterday's text message said that she didn't pass the interview.

1067
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:10,950
Kang Seo Jin passed the first round.

1068
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,490
Was it sent by mistake?

1069
00:54:12,495 --> 00:54:13,655
What did you say?

1070
00:54:14,065 --> 00:54:15,525
Why are you saying it only...

1071
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:18,965
Never mind. What time is the interview?

1072
00:54:19,435 --> 00:54:21,965
What? 2pm?

1073
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:24,905
(To Muui Island)

1074
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:33,175
What? Is there another Wolfman of Huam-dong?

1075
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:36,175
Hello?

1076
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:37,715
Seo Jin, it's me.

1077
00:54:37,885 --> 00:54:39,785
Is that you, Jun Ki?

1078
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:42,285
What is it?

1079
00:54:42,485 --> 00:54:43,785
I...

1080
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:47,860
I took your phone again by mistake.

1081
00:54:47,865 --> 00:54:49,125
Again?

1082
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:52,350
Is my number saved under "Wolfman of Huam-dong"?

1083
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,595
That's not important.

1084
00:54:53,835 --> 00:54:55,700
You passed the first round of interview.

1085
00:54:55,705 --> 00:54:58,230
What? What do you mean?

1086
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,460
Joyoung Daily called you on your phone...

1087
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,905
for the second interview.

1088
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:04,070
Is that true?

1089
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,430
Go to the seminar room on the 10th floor...

1090
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:07,845
of Joyoung Daily by 2pm.

1091
00:55:08,045 --> 00:55:09,875
"2pm"?

1092
00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:13,615
- Oh, no. - What's wrong?

1093
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,980
You can get there in time if you take a taxi.

1094
00:55:15,985 --> 00:55:18,685
I was on my way to the sea on a bus.

1095
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,520
I traveled quite far.

1096
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,225
The interview will be over even if I hurry.

1097
00:55:23,235 --> 00:55:24,895
Will you give up everything?

1098
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:26,965
You said that it's your last interview.

1099
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:29,200
I don't have enough time.

1100
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:32,305
I'll try to postpone it, so come right now.

1101
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:34,075
I'm hanging up.

1102
00:55:39,615 --> 00:55:40,815
Sir.

1103
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:42,840
Please stop the bus.

1104
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,870
We're starting the shoot.

1105
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:46,240
Please stand by.

1106
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,455
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1107
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,725
Excuse me, where are you going?

1108
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:02,460
We have a new instructor.

1109
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,535
Let me introduce him.

1110
00:56:04,605 --> 00:56:05,865
Please come in.

1111
00:56:11,845 --> 00:56:13,045
Hyung Joon?

1112
00:56:14,945 --> 00:56:17,210
Yoon Ah, why are you here?

1113
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:20,385
Please introduce yourself first.

1114
00:56:21,025 --> 00:56:22,915
Yes, I'm sorry.

1115
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:24,510
Let's talk later, Yoon Ah.

1116
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:25,785
Okay.

1117
00:56:29,225 --> 00:56:30,495
Hello.

1118
00:56:30,795 --> 00:56:34,035
I'm Song Hyung Joon. I'll be your instructor from now on.

1119
00:56:34,105 --> 00:56:35,335
It's nice to meet you.

1120
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:41,105
My goodness.

1121
00:56:41,405 --> 00:56:42,900
- This is incredible. - Why?

1122
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,200
Is he that famous?

1123
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,010
It's one of the top pastry chefs in Korea.

1124
00:56:47,015 --> 00:56:48,245
Really?

1125
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:55,985
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1126
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:00,555
- Excuse me. - Gosh.

1127
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:03,090
How much time is left for the interview?

1128
00:57:03,095 --> 00:57:05,065
- It just ended. - It ended?

1129
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:07,835
Can you wait a little longer?

1130
00:57:08,465 --> 00:57:11,365
That won't be possible due to directors' schedule.

1131
00:57:13,605 --> 00:57:16,775
What happens if you miss today's interview?

1132
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:19,470
Then you'll probably be eliminated.

1133
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,675
"Eliminated"?

1134
00:57:20,945 --> 00:57:22,615
That's nonsense.

1135
00:57:22,685 --> 00:57:24,710
It's because of your mistake.

1136
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,540
I didn't hear anything about it.

1137
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,955
What should I do?

1138
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:30,825
(Interview for candidates)

1139
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:35,325
I can't believe this.

1140
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:38,025
Sir, where are you going?

1141
00:57:39,405 --> 00:57:40,865
I can't believe this.

1142
00:57:40,965 --> 00:57:43,295
Sir, where are you going?

1143
00:57:43,675 --> 00:57:45,365
Thank you, everyone.

1144
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,305
You can't go in there.

1145
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:49,505
What's going on?

1146
00:57:50,715 --> 00:57:51,800
Freeze.

1147
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,145
What are you doing?

1148
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:55,475
What in the world...

1149
00:57:58,885 --> 00:58:00,155
Shut it, everyone.

1150
00:58:00,655 --> 00:58:02,385
Prosecutor or not... I mean...

1151
00:58:05,155 --> 00:58:08,580
Interviewers or not, you'll pay if you move an inch.

1152
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,490
Who are you? What are you doing?

1153
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,625
Be quiet.

1154
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:13,835
If you don't want to get hurt, stay still.

1155
00:58:14,035 --> 00:58:15,160
All right?

1156
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,835
You can't do this.

1157
00:58:16,935 --> 00:58:18,105
What?

1158
00:58:20,245 --> 00:58:22,705
What are you going to do about it? What?

1159
00:58:25,175 --> 00:58:27,075
(Document Screening and Interview for Candidates)

1160
00:58:27,285 --> 00:58:28,445
What's this?

1161
00:58:29,585 --> 00:58:31,570
How tall is he?

1162
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,015
What? Why...

1163
00:58:45,265 --> 00:58:46,650
- Hey. - Yes?

1164
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:49,035
Let's have a talk. Come here.

1165
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:51,930
Why are you doing this? Don't do this.

1166
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,575
We should have a talk.

1167
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:55,705
Don't do this. Stop it.

1168
00:59:09,885 --> 00:59:11,850
Help me. Help.

1169
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,185
Help.

1170
00:59:29,805 --> 00:59:30,945
Gosh.

1171
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:36,245
I...

1172
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:39,240
Excuse me. I came here for my interview today.

1173
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,055
My name is Kang Seo Jin.

1174
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:42,240
Wait a moment.

1175
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,685
A strange man is causing a scene here.

1176
00:59:44,855 --> 00:59:47,095
Let me go! Hey!

1177
00:59:47,365 --> 00:59:49,755
Let me go! Let go!

1178
00:59:50,765 --> 00:59:51,895
Gosh.

1179
00:59:59,235 --> 01:00:00,475
Gosh.

1180
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:10,075
I'm sorry.

1181
01:00:18,925 --> 01:00:20,855
I've never seen anyone like that.

1182
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:24,220
Do you know who he is?

1183
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,325
What?

1184
01:00:26,265 --> 01:00:27,320
No.

1185
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,460
You're Kang Seo Jin, right?

1186
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,765
- Yes. - You're a little late.

1187
01:00:30,905 --> 01:00:32,060
I'm sorry.

1188
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,230
Sir, we have one more candidate. What should we do?

1189
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,570
We should take a look. Come inside.

1190
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,205
Thank you.

1191
01:00:49,425 --> 01:00:50,825
This is my limit.

1192
01:00:51,555 --> 01:00:53,925
I can't do this any longer.

1193
01:00:54,795 --> 01:00:58,765
But I can't tell him that I want to stop first.

1194
01:01:00,335 --> 01:01:02,695
What should I do now?

1195
01:01:15,145 --> 01:01:16,445
Gosh!

1196
01:01:17,015 --> 01:01:18,315
Where is it?

1197
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:20,310
What? What?

1198
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:24,285
The radar that I made disappeared completely.

1199
01:01:26,355 --> 01:01:27,920
I can't do this any longer.

1200
01:01:27,925 --> 01:01:30,620
Why not? Can't you make it without the radar?

1201
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,790
Of course not. An aircraft carrier without its radar...

1202
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,465
is like a guest house without any guests.

1203
01:01:36,635 --> 01:01:38,635
I really wanted to finish this.

1204
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:41,805
But there's no need to make it any longer.

1205
01:01:43,715 --> 01:01:45,575
Maybe you're sitting on it.

1206
01:01:47,815 --> 01:01:49,015
No.

1207
01:01:49,885 --> 01:01:52,645
You don't know for sure. Stand up and see.

1208
01:01:55,525 --> 01:01:56,715
All right.

1209
01:01:57,195 --> 01:01:59,225
I'll stand up.

1210
01:02:07,735 --> 01:02:09,620
What? It's not there.

1211
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,635
I told you so.

1212
01:02:13,505 --> 01:02:15,600
I really wanted to finish it.

1213
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,875
But I'll leave now.

1214
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:18,705
Gosh.

1215
01:02:18,775 --> 01:02:21,545
I can't believe the radar went missing.

1216
01:02:22,545 --> 01:02:24,380
It's shocking.

1217
01:02:24,385 --> 01:02:27,485
I'm so upset. Gosh.

1218
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:29,115
How can it go missing?

1219
01:02:29,885 --> 01:02:33,455
Gosh, I don't think I'll be able to sleep now.

1220
01:02:36,765 --> 01:02:38,195
Gosh.

1221
01:02:38,535 --> 01:02:40,820
I'm so worried about him that I can't do this anymore.

1222
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:44,635
- What's wrong with you? - I'm worried about Dong Gu.

1223
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:48,275
I'm experienced at this, so I'm all right,

1224
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:51,500
but I know how stressful it is for people...

1225
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,315
when they lose radars while making plastic models.

1226
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,475
- Really? - Yes.

1227
01:02:58,385 --> 01:02:59,645
You wouldn't know...

1228
01:03:00,425 --> 01:03:04,055
how horrible that feels.

1229
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,980
Dong Gu, are you all right? You must have been shocked.

1230
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,725
Dong Gu, are you all right?

1231
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:12,565
The radar went missing, right?

1232
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:37,925
What are you doing? Does it taste better when you're alone?

1233
01:03:38,355 --> 01:03:40,755
You should go home and rest.

1234
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:42,160
Why did you come here?

1235
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:43,395
Just.

1236
01:03:45,165 --> 01:03:47,235
Here. Give me some too.

1237
01:03:50,105 --> 01:03:51,435
How did the interview go?

1238
01:03:51,605 --> 01:03:52,730
You didn't make any mistakes, right?

1239
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,435
No. It went well.

1240
01:03:55,175 --> 01:03:57,670
What happened to your shoot?

1241
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:58,775
What?

1242
01:04:01,445 --> 01:04:03,815
I just quit.

1243
01:04:06,255 --> 01:04:08,480
Was it because of me?

1244
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,715
No.

1245
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,325
I...

1246
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:14,695
I look smart like an intellectual, right?

1247
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,765
I'd have been perfect as an elite prosecutor,

1248
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,565
but I just didn't fit as a gangster.

1249
01:04:24,135 --> 01:04:25,335
Anyway,

1250
01:04:26,605 --> 01:04:28,335
I wanted to thank you for today.

1251
01:04:28,505 --> 01:04:30,435
Gosh, that's so cheesy.

1252
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:33,915
Don't. Let's just drink.

1253
01:04:51,335 --> 01:04:54,295
How can you drink alcohol like it's water?

1254
01:04:57,705 --> 01:04:59,335
I was...

1255
01:04:59,635 --> 01:05:01,305
a little...

1256
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:05,005
moved by you today.

1257
01:05:06,975 --> 01:05:09,075
Don't even talk about it.

1258
01:05:09,345 --> 01:05:10,985
It was...

1259
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:14,040
a really important interview for you today, wasn't it?

1260
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,610
The last one.

1261
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:18,150
It was the last one.

1262
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:19,355
Yes.

1263
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:21,095
So,

1264
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:25,865
please get into the company.

1265
01:05:26,495 --> 01:05:27,765
All right.

1266
01:05:28,535 --> 01:05:31,835
If I get in, I'll get you...

1267
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:35,135
an eyebrow tattoo.

1268
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:37,135
It'll look pretty.

1269
01:05:40,015 --> 01:05:41,545
Thank you.

1270
01:05:42,345 --> 01:05:43,645
But...

1271
01:05:43,785 --> 01:05:46,715
I don't want a tattoo.

1272
01:05:47,185 --> 01:05:50,155
We should transplant your beard up here.

1273
01:05:50,285 --> 01:05:52,720
Gosh, do you want to die?

1274
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:55,855
I was joking. Just joking.

1275
01:05:58,095 --> 01:06:01,965
When I saw you today,

1276
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:06,135
my heart fluttered.

1277
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:09,505
Why do you think so?

1278
01:06:10,645 --> 01:06:12,405
I must be crazy.

1279
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:18,780
Let go. What are you doing?

1280
01:06:18,785 --> 01:06:21,115
Let me take a look.

1281
01:06:21,255 --> 01:06:22,585
- What? - Look at me.

1282
01:06:29,325 --> 01:06:32,065
I don't understand.

1283
01:06:32,465 --> 01:06:35,765
Why did I think that you looked handsome?

1284
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:27,915
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1285
01:07:28,025 --> 01:07:29,255
What did we do yesterday?

1286
01:07:29,655 --> 01:07:31,750
Alcohol is the problem. Alcohol!

1287
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,510
How dare you do that to my sister?

1288
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,595
Come here! Come here!

1289
01:07:36,525 --> 01:07:38,490
I'm the new recruit, Kang Seo Jin.

1290
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:42,060
Find the singer that has been winning for seven weeks.

1291
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,220
I'm a reporter.

1292
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:45,290
Are you interfering with the people's rights to know?

1293
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:46,290
Did you find out?

1294
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,060
Do you think you can become a reporter?

1295
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,300
You should quit.

1296
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,170
Are you "Bolbbalgan Octopus"?

1297
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:53,270
He looks like Soo Ah's ex-boyfriend.

1298
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,440
Did you get that conman?

1299
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,070
- What are you doing? - I'm going to guard it myself.

1300
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:59,170
- Get me a coke. - Yes, sir.

1301
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:01,240
- Aren't you even angry? - Why were you late?

1302
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,410
Du Shik, let's eat meat. I'm buying.

1303
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:04,910
It's my workroom.

1304
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,780
You should practice here. I will help you.

1305
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,350
Dong Gu, are you angry at me about something?

1306
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,690
Dong Gu, are you crying?

1307
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,550
You're a bigger coward than I thought, aren't you?

1308
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:14,660
So what if you fail and fall down once in a while?

1309
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,760
I'm going to tell her how I feel.

1310
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,405
Yoon Ah. There's something I want to tell you.
