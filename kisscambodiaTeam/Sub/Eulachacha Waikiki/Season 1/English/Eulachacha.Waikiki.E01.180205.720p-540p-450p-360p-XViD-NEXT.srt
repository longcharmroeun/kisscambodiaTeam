1
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:16,279
What is this?

2
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:22,886
Water...

3
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:34,364
What is this?

4
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:56,086
Hello.

5
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,656
Yes, speaking.

6
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:02,892
What?

7
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:07,030
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,399
If you could give us a little more time,

9
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,067
we'll pay the bills this week.

10
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,002
What?

11
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:17,073
How are we going to run this place then?

12
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:19,476
Hello? Hello?

13
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:27,016
What's the noise? What happened?

14
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:30,720
They're cutting off the water because we haven't paid the bills.

15
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:32,622
What?

16
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,593
- When? - Right now.

17
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:43,867
Hey. Do you think this is funny?

18
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:47,771
Didn't I tell you I hate this kind of prank?

19
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,941
Hey. Seriously...

20
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:53,643
Dong Gu.

21
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,546
Turn the water back on, or you'll get in huge trouble.

22
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:58,148
Hey.

23
00:02:58,148 --> 00:03:00,183
Dong Gu is here.

24
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:03,820
Stop playing a prank on me, and turn the water back on!

25
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,522
A prank?

26
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:07,624
The water got cut off because we didn't pay the bills.

27
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:09,225
The water got cut off?

28
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:19,035
Didn't I tell you to pay the bills in time?

29
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:20,403
It's not like I didn't want to pay the bills.

30
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:22,071
We couldn't pay it because we don't have the money to.

31
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,573
The water bill can't be that high.

32
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:25,608
- It was 420 dollars. - 420 dollars?

33
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,544
- Yes. - That is high.

34
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:30,980
Still, you're a CEO. You don't even have 420 dollars?

35
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:34,551
- It's all your fault. - What did you say?

36
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:36,319
Guesthouses are a blue ocean?

37
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,189
Chinese tourists will come swarming in?

38
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:41,424
We'll make a ton of money and produce films?

39
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:43,993
I didn't expect THAAD would become an issue.

40
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:46,362
I can't foresee every change in the Northeast Asian political...

41
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,430
Cut it out!

42
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:49,432
Do you know how much overdue loan interest we have?

43
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,901
We're on the verge of going under.

44
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,737
With the water cut off, how are we going to run this place?

45
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:56,739
Hey, don't worry.

46
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,109
We're three guys. We can make 420 dollars in no time.

47
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,479
He's right. Things can't get any worse than this.

48
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,447
Try to be positive, Dong Gu.

49
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:07,083
What? Be positive?

50
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:10,920
You're right. I'm the one to blame.

51
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,922
I made a very big mistake.

52
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:15,358
We rarely have any guests,

53
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:18,261
our debt is getting bigger and bigger, and the water got cut off.

54
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:20,263
But I was being too negative.

55
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:22,031
I'm so sorry.

56
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,366
Should I go down on my knees?

57
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,767
That's not what I'm saying.

58
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,069
Gosh!

59
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,670
Hey.

60
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,772
Don't take it out on him.

61
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,407
It's okay.

62
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:33,543
I was out of my mind.

63
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:37,447
How could I start a business with these idiots?

64
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,082
I was crazy.

65
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:43,319
What? Be positive?

66
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,088
Gosh.

67
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,258
Nothing is going my way.

68
00:04:48,258 --> 00:04:50,093
I'm sure...

69
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,095
he has anger management issues.

70
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,230
It's okay. Calm down.

71
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,298
Are you crying?

72
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,402
Why? We should all be positive.

73
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,110
What?

74
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:10,413
Things can't get any worse, so we should be positive?

75
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:13,349
If things get any worse than this, I'd rather die.

76
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:16,886
What's this sound?

77
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:20,857
Where is it coming from?

78
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:47,517
A baby?

79
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:51,821
Jun Ki! Du Shik!

80
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,423
- What happened? - What's wrong?

81
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:55,825
- What is it? - What happened?

82
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:57,026
There...

83
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,861
- What's wrong? - What do you mean?

84
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:00,730
- Take a look. - What's with you?

85
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,798
- Take a look. - Why?

86
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:02,966
- What? - Open it.

87
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:07,136
It's a baby. A baby doll.

88
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:09,238
- It moves. - What?

89
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,121
It moved.

90
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,656
Our eyes met.

91
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:28,324
It moved.

92
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,272
(New World)

93
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:50,980
How did the baby end up here?

94
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,615
Why?

95
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:53,883
The baby could be a guest.

96
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:55,885
We haven't had any guests in a long time.

97
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,054
That's why we started drinking so early yesterday.

98
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:59,922
The baby might have come while we were drunk.

99
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,057
Maybe.

100
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:03,059
I don't remember a thing.

101
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,662
Do you remember anything? You didn't drink.

102
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:07,930
I went to bed early for my shoot today.

103
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:10,066
Let's see what's in that bag.

104
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,801
There might be a phone number or something.

105
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,069
- Okay. - Okay.

106
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,547
There's nothing in here.

107
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,683
What's going on?

108
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:29,185
Maybe the parents went out for a moment.

109
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:31,120
Does that make sense to you?

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,555
What kind of parents...

111
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:35,024
would leave this tiny baby alone?

112
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:37,760
Hey, the baby started crying.

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,696
- Do something. - You do something.

114
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,431
- What? - Do something.

115
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:43,933
Well... Why are you crying?

116
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:45,501
Are you hungry?

117
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:49,272
- There, there. - Did the diaper get wet?

118
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:56,546
- What's this? - What is it?

119
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:57,647
Hold on.

120
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,419
Gosh. It's poop.

121
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:26,676
All right.

122
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,046
I'll open it.

123
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:42,058
What's the matter? Is it a mess?

124
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:45,695
Well... The thing is...

125
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:49,999
There's nothing.

126
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,935
- It's a girl. - And?

127
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:56,472
She might be a baby,

128
00:08:56,472 --> 00:08:59,809
but I'm not sure if it's okay for me to change a girl's diaper.

129
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,844
You have such good manners.

130
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:03,946
- You're such a gentleman. - What are you talking about?

131
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:06,048
Cut out the nonsense,

132
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:08,584
and change the diaper!

133
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:10,186
Fine, I'll do it!

134
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:13,656
Sorry.

135
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:20,830
Wet wipes. Give me wet wipes!

136
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:23,199
- Hurry! - Here.

137
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,567
I want some too.

138
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,303
More! I need more.

139
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,604
Here.

140
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,641
Give me a new diaper.

141
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,442
- A new diaper. - Here.

142
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,119
Okay. It's done.

143
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:44,453
Good job.

144
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:45,922
Well...

145
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,224
It wasn't that hard.

146
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,264
Wet wipes.

147
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:58,568
Wet wipes!

148
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:00,636
Hey.

149
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:04,707
I fed you, and I even changed your diapers.

150
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:07,610
But why do you keep crying?

151
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:10,179
Should we just report her to the police?

152
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:12,248
What if a customer just left her so that they could take a walk?

153
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,983
He's right. Let's wait for a day.

154
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:15,918
It'll be uncomfortable for the baby if we take her to the police.

155
00:10:15,952 --> 00:10:17,019
She's so loud.

156
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,488
We don't have any customers, and the water's off.

157
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,190
And we even have a baby now.

158
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:23,693
Why does this have to happen to me?

159
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:26,762
Gosh, my back.

160
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:28,798
Gosh, my back is killing me.

161
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:35,638
What? He's not crying. Right?

162
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:37,206
Hey, that's so cool.

163
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:40,509
My gosh, that's much better.

164
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,847
- What? - My gosh.

165
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:48,217
- Why are you crying again? - What did you just do?

166
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:49,418
Try doing what you did again.

167
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:50,953
Stand up. Try standing up.

168
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,755
All I did was stand up...

169
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:55,224
and straighten my back like this.

170
00:10:57,793 --> 00:11:00,997
- Hey, stay in that position. - You want me to stay like this?

171
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:03,132
What else can you do? Otherwise, she'll keep crying.

172
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,967
But I can't stay like this forever.

173
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:07,703
Let's take turns then. I'm really exhausted.

174
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:10,106
My gosh, look at the time.

175
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,074
I have a movie shoot today. I'll see you guys.

176
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:13,876
Hey, you said the shoot's in the afternoon.

177
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,979
I'm shooting with Park Sung Woong, the godfather of movie acting.

178
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:19,482
I need to get there a little early and practice my lines with him.

179
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:20,783
I'll see you later.

180
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,053
But it's still way too early.

181
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:27,623
Du Shik.

182
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,393
I have to go to a part-time job. I wish you the best of luck.

183
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:31,928
No, wait. What part-time job?

184
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:33,829
I have to work at the convenience store.

185
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,431
- Hey, come on. - Good luck.

186
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:37,500
You can't just leave me here. Du Shik!

187
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:42,505
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

188
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:49,679
Hello? Hey, Soo Ah. What's up?

189
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:51,480
Something important?

190
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,116
Right now?

191
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:56,352
That's great. One.

192
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,254
Okay.

193
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:01,090
You look great. Okay.

194
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:02,458
Smile.

195
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:04,961
One last shot.

196
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,698
Okay. Good job.

197
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:09,999
Thank you.

198
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,046
(Yuhan Bank: Please check your loan and repay it as soon as possible.)

199
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:30,453
Soo Ah, I'm here.

200
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:31,854
Hey, you're here.

201
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:34,657
- Who's that? - Oh, her.

202
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:38,961
Well, the thing is, I woke up this morning and there was...

203
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:41,664
I don't know. Whatever. It's a long story.

204
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:43,165
- Good luck. - Thank you.

205
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:46,535
Soo Ah, you're the reason I'm still alive.

206
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,204
What did you want to say to me?

207
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:50,573
Let's stop seeing each other.

208
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:53,642
What?

209
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,313
You... You want to break up? What are you talking about?

210
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:00,316
Well... Let's just break up.

211
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,552
Why? What's the reason?

212
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:05,788
It's going to take more than four days to tell you everything.

213
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:06,989
Let's just end it.

214
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,290
Tell me why.

215
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,559
I'm willing to hear everything regardless of how long it may take.

216
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,895
Really? Okay, then.

217
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,697
Number one. You're too immature.

218
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,599
Number two. You're incompetent.

219
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,334
Number three. I can't see a bright future ahead of you.

220
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:20,836
Number 4. You're too... Number 5... Number 6...

221
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:23,806
Number 7... Number 87... Number 89...

222
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:25,207
Your hairstyle is gross.

223
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:28,244
Number 90. I hate the sound you make when you eat.

224
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:30,179
- Number 99. You're... - That's enough.

225
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,882
Okay, I get it. That's enough.

226
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,520
How did you manage to stay with me for so long?

227
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,988
Did you even love me at all?

228
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:41,057
Love? Of course, I did.

229
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,126
But love can't keep our relationship going.

230
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:45,528
You sound really materialistic.

231
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:48,998
I'm not materialistic. You're just immature.

232
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:51,667
Anyway, thank you for all the good memories.

233
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,536
I'll return this to you.

234
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,139
Okay, fine. Let's end it.

235
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:00,409
Hey, I don't need that ring. Do whatever you want with it.

236
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:03,245
Thank you so much for going out with a loser like me.

237
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:05,514
I hope you live a great life.

238
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:21,397
Okay. Let's practice one more time and start shooting.

239
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:22,631
- Okay. - Okay.

240
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,000
- You better do well. - Hey.

241
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:26,469
Hey, you're here.

242
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:30,673
I begged the director to give you this role, so you better do well.

243
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:31,907
Okay, I will.

244
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:35,911
Will you be giving me my pay as soon as we're done shooting?

245
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:37,079
Yes, of course.

246
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:40,449
By the way, you didn't say hi to Park Sung Woong yet, did you?

247
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:42,751
- Let's go. Let me introduce you. - Okay.

248
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,696
Sung Woong, he's Lee Jun Ki. He'll be acting with you today.

249
00:14:54,196 --> 00:14:55,464
("Cold-blooded")

250
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,934
Hello, sir.

251
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:03,172
I'm so honored to be able to act with you, sir.

252
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:08,611
What?

253
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:16,185
Pardon?

254
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:21,223
Sorry?

255
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:27,663
Sung... Sung Woong.

256
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:29,965
What's going on?

257
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,334
- Did I do something wrong? - Why are you so slow?

258
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:35,738
He just complimented your eyes. Why couldn't you catch that?

259
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:39,708
- When? - He did this to you.

260
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,910
Is that what he meant by that?

261
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,179
He could've just told me. Why did he have to do that?

262
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,047
He's not a very talkative man.

263
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:48,484
And he hates it when people don't understand him, so be careful.

264
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:50,152
- Okay? - Okay.

265
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,320
See you later.

266
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:55,891
He doesn't talk, but he doesn't like it when people don't understand him?

267
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,226
What does he want?

268
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:02,398
Is that what you call charisma?

269
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,402
My gosh, that was so charismatic.

270
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:14,677
Ready.

271
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,612
Action!

272
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:22,785
Cut. What's wrong, Sung Woong?

273
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,528
Me?

274
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:37,866
Pardon?

275
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,374
What... What?

276
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:53,882
Sung Woong, where are you going? Sung Woong!

277
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:59,855
Hey, who brought him here?

278
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:00,990
I'm sorry, sir.

279
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:02,992
My gosh.

280
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,095
Move.

281
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:08,998
Hey, why are you so out of it?

282
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,199
What did I do?

283
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,369
He told you to take a step back. Why didn't you get that?

284
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,703
He asked me to take a step back?

285
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:16,839
- When? - He kept doing...

286
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:19,742
this to you. He repeated it three times.

287
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:21,510
I thought that meant he liked my eyes.

288
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,412
That differs according to the situation.

289
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:25,114
Why are you so slow-witted?

290
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:28,217
Sung Woong.

291
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:32,021
He could've just told me.

292
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:35,424
This is driving me crazy.

293
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,400
Why won't he give me an advance payment?

294
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:48,037
What am I going to tell Dong Gu?

295
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:49,505
What a headache.

296
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,043
How does this mean...

297
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,413
My gosh, how am I supposed to know what this means?

298
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,848
Jun Ki. Jun Ki.

299
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:02,651
- Are you coming home from work? - Yes.

300
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:04,420
- Are you coming from the store? - Yes.

301
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:05,821
Do you want one?

302
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:07,056
It's only four days past the expiration date.

303
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:08,157
Gosh, it's okay.

304
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,926
Eat them as much as you want, and live a long life.

305
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,630
Why are you so irritated? Did something happen?

306
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:18,834
Oh, right. You had a shoot with Park Sung Woong today.

307
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,769
How did it go? Was he charismatic?

308
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:23,305
Yes, he was charismatic.

309
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,709
- But he's a little weird. - Why?

310
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,277
He doesn't talk.

311
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:31,613
But he hates it when people don't understand him.

312
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:34,850
He doesn't talk, but he hates it when people don't get him?

313
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,785
- That makes no sense. - Exactly.

314
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,522
Here. Let's say I'm Park Sung Woong, and you're me.

315
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:42,358
During the shoot, he did...

316
00:18:43,392 --> 00:18:45,060
this. What do you think that means?

317
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,995
- Take one step back? - How did you know that?

318
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,430
It's pretty obvious.

319
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:51,867
Fine. Okay.

320
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,869
What about this? When we first met,

321
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,071
I told him that I was honored to meet him.

322
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:57,272
And that's when...

323
00:18:58,407 --> 00:18:59,942
he did this. What do you think that means?

324
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,910
- It means he likes your eyes. - You know that too?

325
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,112
Am I the only one who didn't get it?

326
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:04,913
You just have to be quick-witted for this sort of thing.

327
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,648
- You're really slow. - What?

328
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:08,117
How are you going to succeed as an actor?

329
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:09,518
How do you...

330
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,688
My gosh, this finger...

331
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:17,626
We're home.

332
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:21,997
Where's the mom?

333
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,133
Are you sick?

334
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,169
What's wrong? Did something happen?

335
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,341
Is it a trend to keep quiet?

336
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:33,909
Talk to me, you punk!

337
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:35,477
I broke up with Soo Ah.

338
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:38,313
What? Why all of a sudden? What was the reason?

339
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:41,083
I let her tell me about 90 reasons,

340
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,851
but it felt like she had more to tell me.

341
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:44,319
Why? You're completely fine.

342
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,555
Hey, it's pretty obvious.

343
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:49,792
She's getting old, and her family's probably asking her to get married.

344
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,593
But look at him.

345
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,530
He doesn't have a decent job or any money.

346
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,597
He has no future.

347
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:58,834
His guest house is on the verge of closing down.

348
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,402
I'd break up with him too.

349
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:01,837
Gosh.

350
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:06,141
Dating is a luxury for poor people like us.

351
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:11,413
Is that why you look so depressed?

352
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,183
Don't tell me you begged her.

353
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:15,651
What are you talking about?

354
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:18,320
I said, "Fine, I don't need you."

355
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,789
I even took my ring off and threw it on the floor.

356
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,124
Why would you throw it away?

357
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:24,293
It's gold. Gold is expensive these days.

358
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,462
He's right. We could have sold it and paid the water bills.

359
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:28,664
What were you thinking?

360
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:29,898
Should we go and look for it?

361
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:32,201
Are you crazy? Why would we do that?

362
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:33,202
I have my pride.

363
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:34,570
You can stay here and protect your pride.

364
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,771
We'll go and find it. Let's go.

365
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,873
Be quiet. Did you ask around for money?

366
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,575
- Tuna gimbap is my favorite. - That sounds good.

367
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,944
Fine, go ahead and eat.

368
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:44,613
I had no expectations of you two anyway.

369
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:46,949
Hey, once I finish my shoot tomorrow,

370
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:49,485
I'll get paid. Don't worry, you brat.

371
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:51,620
By the way, what should we do about the baby?

372
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,255
We can't wait for her parents forever.

373
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:54,323
Whatever.

374
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:55,958
Let's just report to the police. I'm exhausted.

375
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:58,126
Let's wait just a little longer, okay?

376
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:00,963
Let's wait just one more day. I feel sorry for her.

377
00:21:00,963 --> 00:21:03,398
If you feel so sorry for her, you two take care of her.

378
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:05,934
I've been rocking her all day. My head is spinning.

379
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:08,036
Take over. Take this off me.

380
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:09,805
- Take a step forward. - Okay.

381
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:10,973
Here.

382
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:13,542
Take it off me.

383
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,812
Where are you going? Stop there!

384
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:18,313
Come here!

385
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:20,849
Open the door. Did you lock the door?

386
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,285
I'll smash the door. I'm serious.

387
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:25,988
I'm angry. I'll go get a hammer.

388
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:27,689
Do you think I can't do it?

389
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,692
Come here!

390
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,562
Open the door. Guys!

391
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:35,531
Gosh.

392
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:41,870
Come here.

393
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:48,644
Because of this tiny baby, I'll get sick.

394
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,512
Those brats...

395
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:51,680
They've already left?

396
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,515
They're waking up so early now.

397
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:54,750
They've changed so much.

398
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,118
Can you believe that?

399
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,387
Hello.

400
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,988
Yes, speaking.

401
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:02,457
What? The electricity bill?

402
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:03,926
This week?

403
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:05,928
Our water got cut off. If our electricity gets cut off too,

404
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:07,596
we can't run this place.

405
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:09,831
Hello?

406
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:12,367
He hung up on me. Again!

407
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,836
Gosh, what should I do?

408
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:17,506
Tell me what to do, will you?

409
00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:26,582
Come on. You're embarrassing me.

410
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:35,290
No way. I have my pride.

411
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:48,904
What are you doing here? Soo Ah is not here yet.

412
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:51,139
I see. Is it okay if I wait inside?

413
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,175
- Sure. - Thank you.

414
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:54,843
By the way,

415
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,745
did you clean the studio yesterday?

416
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:58,246
No. Why?

417
00:22:58,246 --> 00:22:59,514
It's nothing.

418
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:22,838
What are you doing here?

419
00:23:24,873 --> 00:23:26,074
You're here.

420
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:29,845
Well... The thing is...

421
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:31,680
Yesterday you acted like you didn't want to see me again.

422
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:32,781
What brings you here?

423
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:36,184
Well... The thing is...

424
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:37,853
I want to ask you something.

425
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:40,522
- What is it? - Well...

426
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:43,625
When do you think the THAAD issue will settle?

427
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:49,898
You came here to ask me that?

428
00:23:50,198 --> 00:23:51,333
Yes.

429
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:54,169
We broke up, but we're still both citizens of South Korea.

430
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:56,138
We can discuss diplomatic issues of this country together.

431
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:59,274
Can't we? What do you think?

432
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:03,045
I think...

433
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,615
we can have good conversations from time to time.

434
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:15,323
Hold on.

435
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,826
What? What is it?

436
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:21,296
Shouldn't we solve the North Korean nuclear issue first?

437
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:23,732
We should adopt a two-track strategy where we apply sanctions...

438
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:25,667
against North Korea and request them to come back to the six-party talks.

439
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:30,772
Great. It's a nice point.

440
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:32,941
But are you sure that's the best option?

441
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:39,214
What do you think we should do then?

442
00:24:39,214 --> 00:24:40,882
How would I know? Politicians will take care of it.

443
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:42,017
I'm leaving.

444
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:43,585
What's with you?

445
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:49,057
Gosh, Dong Gu is so forgetful.

446
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:52,728
Dong Gu!

447
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:55,263
(Gold, silver, jewels, watches)

448
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:58,233
(Jewelry Shop)

449
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:00,635
Welcome.

450
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:02,604
Hello. Do you buy gold rings too?

451
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:04,306
Yes, we do.

452
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:05,941
What would you like to sell?

453
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:07,843
This.

454
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:13,248
Not the dirt, but this ring.

455
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,953
How much can you give me? It's 18K gold.

456
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:21,123
Is that why you came?

457
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:26,561
Soo Ah.

458
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,800
If you had told me, I would have helped you find it.

459
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,703
The thing is, we haven't been able to pay the water bills.

460
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:36,838
So they cut our water, and they said they'll cut our electricity too.

461
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:38,874
Is that so? Then...

462
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:41,476
I hope this helps.

463
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:46,081
You forgot your phone.

464
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:50,719
Soo Ah.

465
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:11,706
Sung Woong, you're so funny.

466
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:13,775
How did you end up in that situation?

467
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:20,182
That's hilarious.

468
00:26:23,218 --> 00:26:24,419
Hi, Sung Woong.

469
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:32,894
I'm sorry I didn't understand you yesterday.

470
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:34,129
Please forgive me.

471
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:48,944
Thank you for forgiving me.

472
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:00,789
You understood him this time.

473
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:02,390
I guess you're getting the hang of it.

474
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,458
Really?

475
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:04,960
I got it right?

476
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,094
Yes.

477
00:27:06,228 --> 00:27:08,897
He pointed at you and patted you on the shoulder.

478
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:12,434
Don't get on his wrong side again, okay?

479
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:15,003
Okay.

480
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:18,373
I did it.

481
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:32,687
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

482
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:36,424
Okay!

483
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:39,060
Good job.

484
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:42,664
Thank you for today.

485
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:50,071
Thank you for your compliment.

486
00:27:50,171 --> 00:27:51,473
I'll work harder.

487
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:00,982
What? Really?

488
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:05,587
Okay.

489
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:08,957
Everyone, Sung Woong will...

490
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:11,059
treat all of us to beef tonight.

491
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:21,569
- Park Sung Woong! - Park Sung Woong!

492
00:28:32,914 --> 00:28:35,183
Sung Woong, would you like to make a toast?

493
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:42,557
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

494
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:43,591
Thank you.

495
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:46,261
- Cheers. - Cheers.

496
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:03,445
My stomach seems to love the beef. It's been a while.

497
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:08,283
Sung Woong, thank you for the food.

498
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:15,824
What's the matter?

499
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,394
Sorry?

500
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:23,264
What?

501
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:26,968
What do you mean?

502
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:17,552
I'm home.

503
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:26,261
Did something happen? What's with the ambiance?

504
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:29,497
Jun Ki won't be able to act anymore.

505
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:31,132
- Why? - Park Sung Woong...

506
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:32,801
told him to that he had a grain of rice on his face.

507
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:34,502
But he ended up kissing him instead.

508
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,172
Why?

509
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:39,340
He was giving me a weird look.

510
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,109
Anybody would've misunderstood him.

511
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:44,479
I thought he wanted a kiss on his cheek for buying us beef.

512
00:30:45,713 --> 00:30:46,848
Why do you look so down as well?

513
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:50,819
Soo Ah caught him selling his ring.

514
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:52,454
What?

515
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:55,723
She looked at me...

516
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:57,659
with so much resentment in her eyes.

517
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:01,796
Does that mean we'll be able to pay our water bills?

518
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:03,164
I didn't sell it.

519
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:06,668
I may have nothing, but I still couldn't sell our couple rings.

520
00:31:06,668 --> 00:31:09,771
Then how are we going to receive any customers without any water?

521
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:11,106
Exactly.

522
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:17,846
But I have to say, we're really pathetic.

523
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,350
We're have so much trouble making 400 dollars in 2 days.

524
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:32,861
Let's give up...

525
00:31:33,962 --> 00:31:35,130
now.

526
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:37,866
Give up what?

527
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:40,635
I'm saying we should give up on this business.

528
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:43,438
We promised to earn money, shoot a movie together, and go to...

529
00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:45,640
- the Cannes Films Festival. - Wake up.

530
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,275
We won't be able to shoot a movie.

531
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,077
We should be grateful that we're still alive.

532
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,380
He's right. I also don't think this is going to go anywhere.

533
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:55,283
The guesthouse and the movie...

534
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:57,552
Let's just give up now.

535
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:00,455
All we do in life is give up.

536
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:02,690
What a lousy life.

537
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:05,460
But what about her?

538
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:08,730
What do you think? We should take her to the police.

539
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,732
What can we do? Her parents gave up on her.

540
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:13,334
But let's at least feed her before we send her away.

541
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:15,170
We're out of formula too.

542
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,618
Is this what she used to eat?

543
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:35,123
What? Why is it so expensive?

544
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:37,492
Don't you have any money? Give me some money.

545
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:38,993
- Excuse me. - Yes?

546
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,595
That's ours.

547
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:43,031
We're going to buy it. We just put it down for a second.

548
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:45,400
Whoever picks it up is the owner.

549
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,268
My gosh, that's ours.

550
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:49,337
My goodness, what are you doing?

551
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:52,240
What's wrong?

552
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:53,641
What's going on?

553
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:56,544
They're claiming that this belongs to them.

554
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:59,080
We were going to buy it. We just put it down for a second.

555
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:02,150
You're fighting over nothing.

556
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,153
Just give it up. You guys are young.

557
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:06,354
What?

558
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:10,391
You want us to give it up?

559
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:12,160
Why?

560
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,828
Why do we need to do that?

561
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:15,196
Well, that's because...

562
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:17,298
We did our best, but nothing worked out.

563
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:20,969
We tried our best, but the world didn't help us out.

564
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,937
We painted the rooms, hung new wallpapers,

565
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:25,106
and we even did the interior design all by ourselves.

566
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:26,975
It was our last hope.

567
00:33:27,342 --> 00:33:31,312
- What are you talking about? - We can give up everything else,

568
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:33,881
but we can't give up on this formula. Okay?

569
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:35,550
Give that to us!

570
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:38,319
- Me neither! - Me neither!

571
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,460
Did you see her face earlier?

572
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:23,131
- Her face was completely pale. - I know.

573
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:26,267
How dare she try to fight us?

574
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:31,372
It's a great day to have some formula.

575
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,175
We'll warm it up.

576
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:38,179
What are you doing?

577
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:39,781
Are you shooting a movie?

578
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:41,883
Come on. It's fun.

579
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,218
He always breaks the mood.

580
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:45,720
You're right.

581
00:34:46,387 --> 00:34:49,691
Hey, did you see how we protected your food?

582
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:51,592
You better not forget this.

583
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:55,296
He's right. I won't forgive you if you forget this.

584
00:34:55,296 --> 00:34:56,597
They're right.

585
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:59,934
- My gosh, look at her. - My goodness. She's so cute.

586
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,969
- She's so cute. - Oh, my gosh.

587
00:35:02,637 --> 00:35:04,439
You're right. She's a cute baby.

588
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:06,040
Thank you.

589
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:10,812
- Are you tourists? - Yes, we're traveling together.

590
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:12,246
Where are you going to go now?

591
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:15,550
Actually, we're looking for a place to sleep.

592
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,751
- Sleep? - Sleep?

593
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:17,952
Sleep.

594
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:21,222
- We have a guesthouse. - Oh, really?

595
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:24,058
Do you happen to have an empty room?

596
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:26,427
Yes, we do. We have an empty room.

597
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,763
We have many rooms.

598
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:30,631
Do you guys want a room?

599
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:31,799
- Yes, sure. - Yes.

600
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,034
Tonight?

601
00:35:33,768 --> 00:35:35,436
Tonight! Let's go!

602
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:38,506
Let's go, you guys. We have customers tonight.

603
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:40,708
Okay, okay. Follow me.

604
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,410
Follow me.

605
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:45,279
Let's go.

606
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:48,483
Guests?

607
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,917
Guests.

608
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,721
- Guests. - Guests.

609
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:03,631
What's going on?

610
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:05,500
- This isn't a dream, right? - I can't believe it either.

611
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,102
We've never had this many customers before.

612
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:10,338
I think that baby brings us luck.

613
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:11,539
I know.

614
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:14,642
We can pay our water and electricity bills with this.

615
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:17,845
And at this rate, we'll be able to pay off our loan and shoot a movie.

616
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,313
My gosh. Are you happy?

617
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:21,082
I thought you wanted to give up.

618
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,984
Well, that's because...

619
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:26,287
I meant we should give up on giving up.

620
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:27,789
Move it.

621
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,658
That punk.

622
00:36:32,427 --> 00:36:34,562
My goodness.

623
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,901
Really?

624
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,036
My gosh. Are you in a good mood, my princess?

625
00:36:42,336 --> 00:36:45,740
My goodness. Are you that happy?

626
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,341
Must you talk like that?

627
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:51,579
My goodness. Are you disturbed by the way I talk?

628
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:55,216
- Cut it out. - Hey, I'm older than you.

629
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,885
Are you angry, Dong Gu?

630
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,787
- My goodness, you're scary. - Stop it.

631
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:02,723
Let's hide from him. Gosh, he's so evil.

632
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:05,193
I told you to stop! Stop it already!

633
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:10,731
Why did you have to yell? You made her cry.

634
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:14,869
Wait. Do you think she's hungry?

635
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:17,305
- Where's the formula? - I put it in the kitchen.

636
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:19,907
Wait here, my princess.

637
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,909
I'll bring you your food.

638
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:23,277
My gosh.

639
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,513
- Come over here. - Hey, stop.

640
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:37,358
Do you think her parents really abandoned her?

641
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:39,727
I can't believe they abandoned that cute baby.

642
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:42,063
There must be a good reason.

643
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:44,031
What if they never come back?

644
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:45,666
Then we can just raise her.

645
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,401
Didn't you see her bring all those customers?

646
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:49,337
I'm actually worried that her mom might come look for her.

647
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:52,073
Gosh, that's nonsense. How can we raise her?

648
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:54,175
Whatever. Let's think about that later.

649
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:56,444
It's time to feed our princess.

650
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:00,681
- My gosh. - It's time to eat...

651
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:02,984
Where did she go?

652
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:06,387
Hey, hey. Where are you taking her?

653
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:08,356
What? What's going on?

654
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,396
Hey, stop!

655
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:18,900
Stop!

656
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,701
Get him!

657
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:45,793
Hey! Stop right there!

658
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:48,396
- Come here! - It's a thief!

659
00:38:48,596 --> 00:38:50,298
- Hey! - Stop!

660
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:51,365
Hey!

661
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,137
Where did he go?

662
00:39:17,158 --> 00:39:18,359
Where is he?

663
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:19,460
Hey.

664
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,496
- Let's go. - He's leaving.

665
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:29,103
You're such a fast runner.

666
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:32,340
You're dead meat. Let me look at you.

667
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:35,977
Gosh.

668
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,312
Are you hurt?

669
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:40,481
I'm Lee Jun Ki.

670
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,385
What's your name?

671
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:50,291
(A Family is Born)

672
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,194
I'm sorry, Sol.

673
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:56,063
I'm so sorry.

674
00:39:56,464 --> 00:39:59,700
It's my fault. I won't do it again.

675
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,068
I'm sorry.

676
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:04,071
I'm so sorry, Sol.

677
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:06,173
Is her name Sol?

678
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,277
Why'd you abandon her if you were going to cry so much?

679
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,614
Isn't that too harsh?

680
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:14,949
It was hard, wasn't it?

681
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:16,384
Do you need a shoulder to cry on?

682
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,587
You jerk, how can you in this situation?

683
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,022
What did I do?

684
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:22,256
That's enough.

685
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,059
Why did you leave the baby?

686
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:26,293
That's right.

687
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:29,063
Where's her dad?

688
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:30,264
Her dad.

689
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,334
Where do you live?

690
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:34,835
Your house.

691
00:40:36,037 --> 00:40:37,938
Stop crying, and say something.

692
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,608
That way we can take you home, or something.

693
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:43,678
She must have her reason. Stop cornering her.

694
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,850
I'm very sorry. I'll be leaving now.

695
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:52,119
Now? Do you have a place to go?

696
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:55,489
Where would you go with a baby at this hour?

697
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:57,658
You should sleep here for tonight.

698
00:40:57,992 --> 00:40:59,527
Sleep here? What are you talking about?

699
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:00,528
We don't have any empty rooms.

700
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:01,862
Seo Jin's room is empty.

701
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:04,131
She's at the library, so she'll be home tomorrow.

702
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:06,467
It's okay. I don't want to cause you any more trouble.

703
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:09,270
Not at all. It's okay. You should sleep here.

704
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,139
Also, don't worry about this punk.

705
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,808
He just got dumped by his girlfriend,

706
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,509
so he's negative about everything.

707
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:16,644
Who got dumped?

708
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:18,679
We have a mutual agreement to break up.

709
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:20,815
I have no feelings for her anymore.

710
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,784
Why did you bring that up?

711
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:28,355
Why are you getting upset?

712
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,624
- You jerk. - Stop it.

713
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,628
It's okay. Don't worry about it. Follow me.

714
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:37,331
Stay calm, and go slowly.

715
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:35,556
I'm so sleepy.

716
00:42:35,623 --> 00:42:38,692
I must sleep. I need to sleep.

717
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:41,796
I need sleep.

718
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:56,076
Who are you? Why are you here?

719
00:42:56,377 --> 00:42:57,845
Are you a thief?

720
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:59,814
No, it's not that. I'm...

721
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,283
What's that?

722
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:04,718
- There's a fire. - What's going on?

723
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:05,719
- What's going on? - What happened?

724
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,987
- What happened? - What are you doing?

725
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:09,723
There's a thief right here.

726
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,725
There's a thief.

727
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,862
Gosh, you startled me for nothing.

728
00:43:14,862 --> 00:43:17,198
She always makes a fuss.

729
00:43:17,965 --> 00:43:20,367
Are you okay, Yoon Ah? Were you startled?

730
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,536
What? Do you know her?

731
00:43:22,536 --> 00:43:25,673
Her name is Yoon Ah. She came to...

732
00:43:25,873 --> 00:43:27,508
You look good.

733
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:29,777
You really are a woman.

734
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:32,446
What did you say?

735
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,949
Get out. Get out now.

736
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:40,654
Oh, I see.

737
00:43:40,654 --> 00:43:43,057
You should have called me.

738
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:44,525
I don't think...

739
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,594
to call each other about these things.

740
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:49,864
- You're right. - I'm sorry. It's my fault.

741
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:52,600
No, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

742
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,170
It's late, so you should share your bed tonight with Yoon Ah.

743
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,472
- Share my bed? - Then should she sleep in my bed?

744
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:01,375
Don't you know that I can't sleep with others?

745
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,878
I said no, but the other two insisted on it.

746
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:05,379
There are other rooms.

747
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:07,414
They're occupied with guests. We have no empty room.

748
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:09,283
All the rooms are occupied? How?

749
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:10,985
It's a long story. It just happened.

750
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:12,386
Just bear it, and share your bed.

751
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:15,489
How can I sleep with a woman I don't know?

752
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:17,524
Stop being fussy.

753
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:19,059
Sleep on the ground then.

754
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:21,095
You woke everyone up at this hour.

755
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:22,396
You put this back.

756
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,399
Sleep in your room.

757
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:27,468
Let's go. Give this to me.

758
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:30,871
- Gosh. - You should sleep in your room.

759
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:08,008
What's going on?

760
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:12,413
Were you uncomfortable? Why didn't you wake me up?

761
00:45:12,413 --> 00:45:14,615
You were sleeping so deeply.

762
00:45:14,615 --> 00:45:18,118
I'm sorry. I have bad sleeping habits.

763
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:21,155
Did I do something wrong?

764
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:23,857
No. You only farted a few times.

765
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:25,392
It didn't smell that bad.

766
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:38,605
Here's your breakfast.

767
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:40,574
- Thank you. - Goodness.

768
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:43,711
The toast is bleeding.

769
00:45:45,713 --> 00:45:46,714
Cover your mouth.

770
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:48,716
We have guests here.

771
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:52,119
- It was uncomfortable to sleep. - How so?

772
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,089
It's not comfortable to share a bed with a stranger.

773
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,790
When I fall asleep, the baby cries.

774
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,759
Then the mother snores.

775
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:02,096
She has a knack for making people uncomfortable.

776
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:03,263
On top of that...

777
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:04,965
What?

778
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:13,607
Thank you for last night.

779
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:14,641
I'll get going now.

780
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,977
You said you have no place to go. You can stay longer.

781
00:46:16,977 --> 00:46:18,045
What do you mean?

782
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:19,413
She has no place to go.

783
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:20,914
You have so heartless.

784
00:46:21,248 --> 00:46:23,417
I don't want to bother you more.

785
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,252
Have some breakfast at least.

786
00:46:25,252 --> 00:46:28,288
It's okay. I'm not hungry at all...

787
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:32,259
Goodness.

788
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:33,360
Have a seat. I'll make one for you.

789
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,662
Gosh, she's a mess.

790
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:53,514
Eat slowly.

791
00:46:53,747 --> 00:46:55,482
Have some milk as well.

792
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:59,253
Du Shik is taking care of the baby, so don't worry.

793
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,088
I'll bring you some more.

794
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:06,727
What should I do?

795
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:08,195
Why is she crying?

796
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:11,065
She suddenly started to cry. I can't make her stop.

797
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:13,133
Look at the time.

798
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:15,502
Thank you.

799
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:18,705
Were you hungry, Sol? I'm sorry.

800
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,374
Let me feed you.

801
00:47:23,977 --> 00:47:25,412
Two more toasts.

802
00:47:29,283 --> 00:47:30,784
- That startled me. - What's going on?

803
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:31,985
- What? - What did you see?

804
00:47:31,985 --> 00:47:33,187
- Did you see it? - No.

805
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:36,123
I told you that she makes people uncomfortable.

806
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:40,994
What's going on? That's strange.

807
00:47:41,595 --> 00:47:43,097
What's wrong?

808
00:47:43,097 --> 00:47:45,599
She can't suck on the milk.

809
00:47:45,899 --> 00:47:47,668
Shall I make some baby formula?

810
00:47:47,668 --> 00:47:50,337
No, she has a weak immune system.

811
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:52,706
I have to breastfeed her until she's a year old.

812
00:47:53,907 --> 00:47:55,542
Do I have to pump my breast milk?

813
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:57,044
Pump?

814
00:47:57,611 --> 00:47:59,480
I don't have a breast pump. I'm in trouble.

815
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,881
- What's a breast pump? - Do you know?

816
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:02,049
- What's a breast pump? - How would I know?

817
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,851
- Ask her. - Yoon Ah.

818
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:05,786
What's a breast pump?

819
00:48:05,786 --> 00:48:07,488
It's...

820
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:09,823
a machine to pump breast milk.

821
00:48:09,823 --> 00:48:13,127
We pump the breast milk when the baby can't suck.

822
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:16,463
Where can we find a breast pump?

823
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:17,865
Let me think.

824
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:19,967
They sell it at baby stores,

825
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:23,003
but they're quite expensive.

826
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,271
I don't have money.

827
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:25,939
Fine, we'll buy one for you.

828
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:29,576
Please don't move.

829
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:31,745
- I'll go. - I'll go with you.

830
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:33,647
I have a part-time job. Let's go.

831
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:35,082
Goodness.

832
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:38,051
Guys, please take me with you.

833
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:39,753
We have guests. You can't leave.

834
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,355
- Stay at home. - Right.

835
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:43,323
- I'm sorry. - No.

836
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:44,758
I'm not comfortable with her.

837
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:45,893
Please take me.

838
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:47,194
I'm begging you to just stay here.

839
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:48,729
Jun Ki!

840
00:48:58,005 --> 00:49:01,108
When women become mothers, they only care about their babies.

841
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,710
She revealed her breast in front of men.

842
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:06,513
I was so startled.

843
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:07,948
I know.

844
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,751
There are so many things here.

845
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:13,287
What does a breast pump look like?

846
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:15,722
They sell clothes too.

847
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:20,194
What? It opens.

848
00:49:20,227 --> 00:49:21,929
Why is it...

849
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:26,466
Hello.

850
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:29,536
The item that you're looking at is a breastfeeding outfit.

851
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:32,639
What is it? When you go out with your cute baby,

852
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,242
the baby may cry because she's hungry.

853
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:39,046
It's awkward to breastfeed because too many people are around.

854
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,014
Do not worry.

855
00:49:41,014 --> 00:49:44,384
Undo the zipper, and take out your breast.

856
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:48,121
Then you can breastfeed while completely hiding your breast.

857
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:51,658
In other words, it's called a breast pocket.

858
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:53,794
A breast...

859
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:55,629
A breast pocket?

860
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:58,565
There are many interesting items.

861
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,668
What's this?

862
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:03,971
Hello.

863
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:07,574
The item that you're looking at is called breastfeeding pad.

864
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:08,742
What is a breastfeeding pad?

865
00:50:08,742 --> 00:50:11,078
While sucking from the mother's breast,

866
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:13,213
the baby gets full. What would he do?

867
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:15,182
He pulls away from her nipple.

868
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,150
What would happen to the mother?

869
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:22,122
The breast milk will squirt out like a fountain.

870
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:25,292
If you stick a breastfeeding pad,

871
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:27,561
you can rest assured.

872
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:32,866
In other words, it's a cover for your breast milk.

873
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,209
Are you looking for something in particular?

874
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:44,645
I'm here to buy a breast pump.

875
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:02,796
Gosh, this is extremely awkward.

876
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,265
I must say something. Say something.

877
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:10,971
The baby's eyebrows are so thick.

878
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:13,407
Look at the plump cheeks.

879
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:15,475
He's a warrior and a prince.

880
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:16,643
It's a daughter.

881
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:19,212
I see.

882
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,748
I thought so. She seemed boyish.

883
00:51:21,782 --> 00:51:23,817
The tomboy look is popular these days.

884
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:25,786
Her dad must adore her.

885
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:26,953
We broke up.

886
00:51:29,623 --> 00:51:30,924
I see.

887
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:35,262
Being a single mom isn't bad.

888
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:36,330
Who cares if there's no dad?

889
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,999
Her grandparents can love her twice as much.

890
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:41,668
Both of them passed away.

891
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:43,670
When I was two,

892
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:46,506
they died in a fire.

893
00:51:55,515 --> 00:51:58,485
Come back now. Hurry.

894
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:05,125
There's a manual breast pump and an automatic breast pump.

895
00:52:05,158 --> 00:52:08,328
For a manual breast pump, attach the funnel...

896
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,497
on the breast.

897
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,933
Pull the handle.

898
00:52:16,636 --> 00:52:19,206
This is how you milk the breast.

899
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:22,476
For an automatic breast pump, press the on button.

900
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:24,544
From 40 to 50 in a minute...

901
00:52:31,918 --> 00:52:35,455
Please stop. Give us either one, and stop explaining.

902
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,157
I beg you. Please.

903
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:42,396
The culture shock was equivalent to a natural disaster.

904
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:45,432
- Right? - Yes.

905
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:49,302
Shall we take some medicine to calm down?

906
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,238
Okay.

907
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,608
Hey, isn't that Soo Ah?

908
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:57,644
Dong Gu, there's Soo Ah...

909
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,581
Dong Gu?

910
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,451
What are you doing over there?

911
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:08,655
What? There's a pillar.

912
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:10,757
It's very strong.

913
00:53:10,957 --> 00:53:14,194
Of course pillars are strong. They aren't soft.

914
00:53:15,095 --> 00:53:17,063
Did you...

915
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,433
- Soo Ah. - What's going on?

916
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:22,302
Stop it. What's wrong?

917
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:25,071
- Stop it. - Gosh, Dong Gu.

918
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:28,875
If you still have feelings for her, go and beg her to come back.

919
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,344
I didn't do anything wrong. Why would I kneel?

920
00:53:31,344 --> 00:53:33,814
Getting caught trying to sell your ring isn't something to brag about.

921
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,515
Well, that's...

922
00:53:35,749 --> 00:53:37,951
I told you not to bring it up.

923
00:53:38,852 --> 00:53:40,854
I can see that you have regrets.

924
00:53:40,854 --> 00:53:42,823
That's not true.

925
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:47,127
Fine, stay proud.

926
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:49,496
Live all your life in regrets.

927
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:50,797
Soo Ah went this way.

928
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:52,933
I'm going this way too. I'm leaving.

929
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:55,268
- Stay here. - Wait for me.

930
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:56,503
Go after she leaves.

931
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:22,796
I don't know anymore.

932
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,865
What's the point of staying proud?

933
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:26,933
Fine, I'll kneel.

934
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:29,236
It's better than living in regrets.

935
00:54:40,013 --> 00:54:41,781
Excuse me, Soo...

936
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:42,949
Soo Ah.

937
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:46,953
Yoon Seok, why are you so late?

938
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:50,490
I'm sorry. To apologize, I'll buy you some delicious pasta.

939
00:54:51,157 --> 00:54:52,292
Let's go.

940
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:57,697
- What's wrong with him? - What?

941
00:54:58,098 --> 00:55:00,634
He suddenly fell down. Wait.

942
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:03,904
Are you okay?

943
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:07,040
Are you sick?

944
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:09,743
Excuse me?

945
00:55:12,112 --> 00:55:13,280
Excuse me?

946
00:55:13,813 --> 00:55:15,148
Can you lift your face?

947
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:16,616
- No. - Sir?

948
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:18,518
Are you okay?

949
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,022
Jun Ki.

950
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:25,091
Why did you come so late?

951
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:26,793
What are you doing? I can't breathe, you wench.

952
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:29,195
It was so awkward.

953
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:31,798
I thought I was losing my mind while looking for this.

954
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:33,667
Did something happen?

955
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:36,036
I don't know. Don't ask. I don't want to think.

956
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:37,737
- I told you... - Be quiet. Move.

957
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:39,573
Move.

958
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,609
I brought you a breast pump, Yoon Ah.

959
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:45,478
Thank you. I'm sorry for bothering you.

960
00:55:45,612 --> 00:55:49,049
Not at all. Sol must be hungry. You should feed her.

961
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:51,318
Sol, weren't you hungry?

962
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:52,852
Let's eat.

963
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:55,255
Let's see.

964
00:55:55,255 --> 00:55:56,690
This is how it looks.

965
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,527
Goodness.

966
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:05,498
- What's wrong with her? - I told you.

967
00:56:05,498 --> 00:56:07,200
She makes people uncomfortable.

968
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:10,904
What's going on?

969
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:13,673
What's wrong this time?

970
00:56:13,673 --> 00:56:15,308
I can't get any breast milk.

971
00:56:16,142 --> 00:56:18,945
- The mammary glands are clogged. - Mammary glands?

972
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:21,648
What's that?

973
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:24,451
They're glands that secrete milk.

974
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:25,986
I think they're clogged.

975
00:56:25,986 --> 00:56:27,754
What should we do to fix it?

976
00:56:27,754 --> 00:56:30,090
They can be unclogged with a massage.

977
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:32,792
Calling a massage therapist is costly.

978
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:35,595
I'll take out a loan to bring one.

979
00:56:35,595 --> 00:56:38,131
Please don't move. I beg you.

980
00:56:41,968 --> 00:56:44,738
Pardon? It's 100 dollars per massage?

981
00:56:45,238 --> 00:56:46,840
It really is expensive.

982
00:56:46,906 --> 00:56:48,441
Can you come immediately?

983
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:51,378
What? That's not possible.

984
00:56:52,312 --> 00:56:54,614
- Okay. - They can't come?

985
00:56:54,614 --> 00:56:57,283
Due to reservations, it's only possible after a week.

986
00:56:57,984 --> 00:56:59,119
What should we do?

987
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,553
It can't be helped.

988
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:06,226
- What's wrong? - They hurt because they're swollen.

989
00:57:06,226 --> 00:57:07,427
We're in trouble.

990
00:57:11,197 --> 00:57:14,034
What? Why are you looking at me?

991
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:15,435
- You do it. - What?

992
00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:17,671
- Do what? - Massage.

993
00:57:17,904 --> 00:57:19,239
Give her a massage.

994
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:21,441
All you have to do is squeeze them.

995
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,575
Are you crazy?

996
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,744
How can I massage a stranger's breasts?

997
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:26,713
Should I do it? Sure I want to.

998
00:57:26,713 --> 00:57:28,314
If I could learn it now, I would want a career in it.

999
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:30,116
Shall I close my eyes and do it myself?

1000
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:32,752
- You're out of your mind. - So you do it.

1001
00:57:33,086 --> 00:57:35,488
Don't you feel bad for her? She's in pain.

1002
00:57:35,488 --> 00:57:36,589
It hurts.

1003
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:38,425
I feel bad for her, but...

1004
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:41,628
Even still, how can I touch her breasts?

1005
00:57:42,562 --> 00:57:44,364
It's okay, I'm fine...

1006
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,134
It hurts.

1007
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:53,807
I'm about to lose my mind.

1008
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:57,277
Are you losing your mind?

1009
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:04,384
Sir, are you okay?

1010
00:58:06,186 --> 00:58:07,587
This is driving me crazy.

1011
00:58:07,587 --> 00:58:10,457
Please leave. Leave, you jerk.

1012
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,759
Yoon Seok, let's go.

1013
00:58:13,793 --> 00:58:15,128
How could we?

1014
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:17,363
We can't leave someone in pain.

1015
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:21,668
Just leave. Leave me alone, you jerk.

1016
00:58:25,338 --> 00:58:26,506
We're over here.

1017
00:58:29,976 --> 00:58:30,977
Did you make a report?

1018
00:58:30,977 --> 00:58:33,947
He fell down, and he can't get up.

1019
00:58:33,947 --> 00:58:36,216
I think he hurt his face.

1020
00:58:36,216 --> 00:58:37,383
Is that so?

1021
00:58:39,085 --> 00:58:41,354
Sir, do you hear me?

1022
00:58:41,488 --> 00:58:42,756
Try to stand up.

1023
00:58:44,758 --> 00:58:47,427
This isn't possible. We have to force him up.

1024
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:48,728
Gather around.

1025
00:58:48,928 --> 00:58:51,064
- Ready? In 1, 2. - In 1, 2.

1026
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:56,903
Sir, you need to loosen up. Let's try again.

1027
00:58:56,903 --> 00:58:58,972
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1028
00:59:02,142 --> 00:59:03,343
He's so stiff.

1029
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:04,811
Call a bigger hospital for help.

1030
00:59:04,811 --> 00:59:06,613
Just a second.

1031
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:10,049
Okay, I'll get up.

1032
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,751
Are you okay now?

1033
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:15,588
It'll be so embarrassing if I get caught.

1034
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,223
I'll just have to take my risk.

1035
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:49,556
Sir.

1036
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:54,160
Are you okay?

1037
00:59:55,528 --> 00:59:58,498
My gosh, he must've hurt his head as well.

1038
01:00:35,768 --> 01:00:36,836
I'll...

1039
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:38,805
begin now.

1040
01:00:43,176 --> 01:00:44,510
I'm so tired.

1041
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:47,747
I wonder when I'll be able to stop working part-time jobs.

1042
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:50,083
My gosh.

1043
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,485
I'm probably the only CEO that needs to work a part-time job,

1044
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:54,287
so he can pay his bills on time.

1045
01:00:59,726 --> 01:01:00,827
What's this?

1046
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,167
How did it go?

1047
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:11,204
My gosh, this is incredible.

1048
01:01:11,204 --> 01:01:14,240
My goodness. My gosh.

1049
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:21,281
How did it go? Did you succeed?

1050
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:23,283
Can't you see?

1051
01:01:23,616 --> 01:01:25,752
I thought I hit an oil well.

1052
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:27,620
What a relief.

1053
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:31,524
Good job. I'm so proud of you.

1054
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:34,060
Be quiet. Where's the breast pump?

1055
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,295
She wants it now.

1056
01:01:35,295 --> 01:01:37,597
The breast pump? I put it...

1057
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:41,100
By the way, is she older than you?

1058
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:43,569
Based on looks, I thought you were much older.

1059
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:44,637
What?

1060
01:01:44,637 --> 01:01:47,240
I've been too easy on you lately, haven't I?

1061
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,108
Gosh, I was just kidding.

1062
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:50,109
Sure you were.

1063
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:51,210
- It was a joke. - Come over here.

1064
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:54,480
- I was just kidding. It was a joke. - You deserve a beating.

1065
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:57,150
This feels nice.

1066
01:02:00,286 --> 01:02:01,387
Get off.

1067
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:03,623
- Hey! - You startled me.

1068
01:02:03,623 --> 01:02:05,458
What do you think you're doing?

1069
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,593
- What? What did I do? - What did you do?

1070
01:02:07,927 --> 01:02:10,630
What did you do?

1071
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,966
Do you even know what this is?

1072
01:02:12,966 --> 01:02:14,767
Why did you hit me? Isn't this a massager?

1073
01:02:14,767 --> 01:02:15,902
It's not a massager.

1074
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:18,938
You jerk. This is for squeezing... You jerk!

1075
01:02:18,938 --> 01:02:20,506
It feels really nice. You should try it.

1076
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:23,009
What? You little jerk. How could you...

1077
01:02:23,476 --> 01:02:25,979
You stupid punk. Do you know how expensive this is?

1078
01:02:26,045 --> 01:02:27,146
You jerk!

1079
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:28,681
(Waikiki Guesthouse and Hostel)

1080
01:02:28,948 --> 01:02:30,283
You're the one who needs to better. Just you.

1081
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:31,384
He's right.

1082
01:02:33,353 --> 01:02:35,421
Dong Gu, what's wrong with you? Did something happen?

1083
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:37,490
Don't ask me anything.

1084
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,497
Why is it so quiet here? Where are the customers?

1085
01:02:44,497 --> 01:02:47,133
They're having a party on the rooftop.

1086
01:02:47,133 --> 01:02:49,435
They went crazy over grilled pork.

1087
01:02:49,902 --> 01:02:51,838
- Really? Good. - Yes.

1088
01:02:53,906 --> 01:02:55,775
What about the woman and her baby? Did they leave?

1089
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:59,445
What? Yes, they left.

1090
01:02:59,846 --> 01:03:01,914
Okay, that's good.

1091
01:03:02,448 --> 01:03:06,152
But doesn't the house feel empty now that it's quiet?

1092
01:03:06,986 --> 01:03:08,021
I wonder how she's doing.

1093
01:03:08,021 --> 01:03:09,322
I'm worried. She said she has nowhere to go.

1094
01:03:09,322 --> 01:03:11,190
- I'm so worried. - Right, Jun Ki?

1095
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,326
Me too. We could've let her stay here.

1096
01:03:13,326 --> 01:03:16,095
You're worried too, aren't you?

1097
01:03:16,095 --> 01:03:17,230
What?

1098
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,866
You're being suspicious. What's going on?

1099
01:03:19,866 --> 01:03:23,002
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

1100
01:03:23,002 --> 01:03:24,670
My gosh, what are you talking about?

1101
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,105
We're not hiding anything.

1102
01:03:26,105 --> 01:03:28,274
- Can't you trust anyone? - Exactly.

1103
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,450
What? Isn't that a baby crying?

1104
01:03:37,717 --> 01:03:39,419
What sound? I didn't hear anything.

1105
01:03:39,419 --> 01:03:42,021
- Me neither. - I didn't hear anything either.

1106
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:46,292
Seo Jin.

1107
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:48,694
I think my milk ducts are clogged again. What should I do?

1108
01:03:51,964 --> 01:03:54,467
Why is she still here?

1109
01:03:54,467 --> 01:03:56,102
I thought she left.

1110
01:03:56,102 --> 01:03:57,837
Who? Her?

1111
01:03:57,837 --> 01:04:00,473
She's not Yoon Ha. She's someone else.

1112
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:02,442
Okay, In Sun. We'll be right there.

1113
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:05,344
Oh, really? Okay.

1114
01:04:05,778 --> 01:04:08,748
Do you think I'm a fool? Why are you doing this?

1115
01:04:08,915 --> 01:04:11,818
Hey, hey. Stop it. Hey!

1116
01:04:12,118 --> 01:04:13,853
Don't you feel sorry for her?

1117
01:04:13,853 --> 01:04:16,155
We may not have money, but we have compassion.

1118
01:04:16,155 --> 01:04:17,290
I don't have either.

1119
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,358
- Hey, hey! - Dong Gu.

1120
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:21,360
- Let me go! - Come on, Dong Gu.

1121
01:04:21,861 --> 01:04:23,196
- Let go of me. - Hey.

1122
01:04:23,196 --> 01:04:24,897
I can't believe this. What's this?

1123
01:04:24,897 --> 01:04:28,101
Come on. She has nowhere to go. Let's let her stay here.

1124
01:04:28,101 --> 01:04:31,037
- Hey. - Yoon Ah, go back inside.

1125
01:04:31,037 --> 01:04:33,806
- Let me go. - Go back inside.

1126
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:07,373
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1127
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,908
She's definitely the type...

1128
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:10,676
that will get herself into big trouble.

1129
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:12,378
My gosh.

1130
01:05:12,578 --> 01:05:13,713
Oh, gosh.

1131
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,849
- My goodness. - I don't like her.

1132
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:17,884
I really don't like her.

1133
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:19,018
Please buy me this.

1134
01:05:19,018 --> 01:05:20,987
- Who's this? - What? She's my girlfriend.

1135
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:22,155
Girlfriend?

1136
01:05:22,155 --> 01:05:25,691
It's a Korean version of "X-Men". I'm sure it's going to be popular.

1137
01:05:25,725 --> 01:05:28,528
I'm going to get rid of your part if you mess up your makeup.

1138
01:05:28,528 --> 01:05:29,829
You little jerk!

1139
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:30,863
My gosh!

1140
01:05:30,863 --> 01:05:31,864
- Freeze! - What's that?

1141
01:05:31,864 --> 01:05:34,834
You really make your life tough on yourself.

1142
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:36,102
- Are you Chewbacca? - Seo Jin.

1143
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:37,203
Yoon Ah.

1144
01:05:37,236 --> 01:05:40,339
My hair grows only a couple hours after I shave.

1145
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,276
Hey, you're killing me here!

1146
01:05:43,276 --> 01:05:44,911
Did you use this mushroom to cook the stew?

1147
01:05:44,911 --> 01:05:47,480
- Everyone's sick because of... - I'm sorry.

1148
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,383
I can't let go of this anymore, so please pack up and leave.

1149
01:05:50,883 --> 01:05:52,852
What are you doing?

1150
01:05:53,619 --> 01:05:54,720
Soo Ah.
