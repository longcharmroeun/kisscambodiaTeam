1
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:38,070
Du Shik, Du Shik!

2
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,640
- Du Shik, sweep! - Sweep!

3
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:40,640
- Sweep, sweep! - Sweep!

4
00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:42,170
Dong Gu, hurry!

5
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:44,285
- Sweep, sweep! - Hurry!

6
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:46,280
Sweep!

7
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:48,450
Hurry, hurry!

8
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,555
Hurry!

9
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:53,790
What are you guys doing right now?

10
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,065
Is it curling now?

11
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:58,260
I told you to clean. What nonsense is this?

12
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,620
We were cleaning.

13
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:01,830
What's so wrong with having some fun while getting it done?

14
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:05,000
We didn't want to do it. It was Jun Ki's idea, I swear.

15
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,505
What? It was Jun Ki's idea?

16
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,370
Did you really have to tell on him?

17
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:12,640
That's so petty of you.

18
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:14,485
What? "Petty"?

19
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:16,115
Hey, Seo Jin.

20
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,985
Why are you taking Jun Ki's side?

21
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,850
I'm not taking anyone's side.

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,150
That's absurd.

23
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:24,225
- What's with you? - I'm petty?

24
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:32,895
I have to go to the script reading.

25
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:37,575
Hurry!

26
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,970
Du Shik, is there something going on between those two?

27
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,375
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:46,215
Are you saying they're together or something?

29
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,515
- That's impossible. - You're right.

30
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:53,710
Jun Ki could do much better.

31
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:55,850
Are you crazy? Do you have a death wish?

32
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:56,925
(Secretly, Greatly)

33
00:01:58,388 --> 00:02:00,525
I'm so tired of cleaning.

34
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:03,095
I really should be working on my Web fiction.

35
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:05,095
Du Shik!

36
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:06,830
What's the fuss?

37
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,830
This time, I came upon something I can do really well.

38
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,935
Take a look.

39
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:13,870
"Soorgio Armhany"?

40
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,870
"Business plan"?

41
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:17,170
I want to start an online shopping mall.

42
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:18,900
Soorgio Armhany Mall.

43
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:20,785
Soo Ah Mall for short.

44
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:22,840
I've been thinking,

45
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:25,515
and I'm convinced fashion is my thing.

46
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,785
You want to start a business?

47
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:29,150
Do you have money for that?

48
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:31,550
Yes, I received an investment from Soo Bong.

49
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:32,925
He just got paid.

50
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,090
Wake up. Do you think it's easy to run a business?

51
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:38,120
Also, you can't do this alone.

52
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:40,430
I'm not alone. You're going to help me.

53
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,430
What? Me?

54
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,830
When? Where? What? Why?

55
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:46,505
Wouldn't a shopping mall director be better than a part-timer?

56
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:47,945
Director?

57
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:49,745
I'll be a director?

58
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,645
How much are you going to pay me?

59
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,910
- 3. - 30,000 dollars a year?

60
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:57,455
No. Three dollars an hour.

61
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:01,210
The minimum wage is 7 dollars and 50 cents by law.

62
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:02,750
And you're going to pay me three dollars an hour?

63
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,680
Fine. I'll do you a favor.

64
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:07,695
I'll pay you 3 dollars and 50 cents. Are you happy now?

65
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:10,290
Director Bong, come with me. We have so much to do.

66
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:12,290
No. I don't want to do this.

67
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:14,530
- I don't need an evil boss. - Come here.

68
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,665
Hey!

69
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:18,105
I've just finished my work here. I'll be at the studio soon.

70
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:21,805
See you in a bit, Hyun Joon.

71
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:27,315
I'm interested in her.

72
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:28,785
I like her.

73
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,010
Are you going to the studio again?

74
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,650
Yes. I have to practice something.

75
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,585
I see. Are you done cleaning?

76
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:38,980
It was a bit messy on the third floor.

77
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:42,250
The third floor? I vacuumed and mopped the floor.

78
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:44,890
All right. I saw some stains on the upper right side of the bowl...

79
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,930
in the bathroom on the second floor. Have you cleaned it?

80
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,160
Yes. I cleaned it from the upper right side...

81
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,735
to the lower left side with bleach.

82
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:53,235
Okay.

83
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,500
Well, the billiard table on the third floor, at the 4 o'clock...

84
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:58,870
You mean the dust in the pocket at the 4 o'clock position?

85
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,340
I've wiped it off.

86
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,185
I even waxed the cues and balls.

87
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,315
- You can go then. - Okay. See you.

88
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,865
She's become so meticulous. She's like a cleaning expert now.

89
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:20,865
I don't want her to get too close with him.

90
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,005
Gosh, it's bothering me.

91
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,045
We're almost home already.

92
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:31,870
Are you sad, Bacca?

93
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,975
Bacca?

94
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:34,685
It's your nickname.

95
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:38,415
It doesn't feel appropriate to call my girlfriend Chewbacca.

96
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:42,110
I was deciding between Chew and Bacca,

97
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:43,995
and Bacca sounded cuter to me.

98
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:47,390
Would you rather prefer to be called...

99
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,525
Wolfman of Huam-dong?

100
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,795
I don't really like any of those names,

101
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,090
but call me anything except Wolfman of Huam-dong.

102
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:55,305
Then I'll call you Bacca.

103
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:56,865
By the way,

104
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,235
how long are we going to keep our relationship a secret?

105
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,170
Why don't we just tell Dong Gu?

106
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,415
What? Don't you know what he's like?

107
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:07,885
He'll beat me to death if he finds out.

108
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:12,315
Let's keep it a secret for the time being, okay?

109
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:13,825
Okay.

110
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:17,380
Are we just going home like this?

111
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,020
What do you mean?

112
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:21,090
Are we supposed to tumble or crawl or something?

113
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,825
That's not what I mean.

114
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,135
What?

115
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,730
- You want a kiss? - Yes.

116
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:30,835
But...

117
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,160
- right here? - Yes.

118
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,575
Someone might see us.

119
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,615
No one is around. Come on.

120
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,185
All right.

121
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:44,315
You're so cheeky, Bacca.

122
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:46,215
Come here.

123
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:54,595
Gosh, what are they doing on the streets?

124
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:59,865
Wait. She looks familiar.

125
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,235
Seo Jin!

126
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,405
It's you, right?

127
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,600
What are you doing right now?

128
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,370
Is it Dong Gu?

129
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:12,975
Yes. What should we do?

130
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:16,110
Who are you? Stay right there.

131
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:17,715
- Okay? - My goodness.

132
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:20,010
Hey. Where are you going?

133
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:21,450
You're mistaken.

134
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:22,985
Cut it out. Let go of me.

135
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,135
What just happened?

136
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,845
What a persistent idiot.

137
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:45,815
Hold on.

138
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,815
That red coat looks familiar.

139
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:56,525
Wait. No way.

140
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
You...

141
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:00,995
- No. - You...

142
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:07,835
Seo Jin. Tell me the truth.

143
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:10,530
It was Jun Ki at the park, right?

144
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,500
No, it wasn't him.

145
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:13,900
Who are you trying to fool?

146
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:16,775
He was wearing Jun Ki's coat.

147
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,570
I knew it. You've been shaving your face...

148
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,610
so regularly these days.

149
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:23,140
It wasn't Jun Ki.

150
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:26,510
Then who is he? Tell me.

151
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:27,725
Well,

152
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:29,985
I got a new boyfriend.

153
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,925
What? Boyfriend?

154
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:33,825
Then why did he run away?

155
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,020
Well,

156
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:38,520
you were yelling at him. He must have been scared.

157
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:41,605
No. Something doesn't feel right.

158
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,675
Something is very wrong here.

159
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,645
Yes, Director.

160
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:52,145
I just got home.

161
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:55,485
Okay. See you tomorrow.

162
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,715
What? Why are you staring at me?

163
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,050
Tell me the truth.

164
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,650
You were kissing Seo Jin in the park, right?

165
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:06,025
What are you talking about?

166
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:09,050
I've been rehearsing all day.

167
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:12,420
Seo Jin was kissing someone?

168
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:13,590
Who's the guy?

169
00:08:13,596 --> 00:08:14,830
- Stop acting. - What?

170
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:18,005
He was wearing the exact same coat as you.

171
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:22,305
Just because I'm wearing this coat, I'm Seo Jin's boyfriend?

172
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:25,470
Also, why would I go out with a bad-tempered girl...

173
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:27,885
with a mustache?

174
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:31,815
That's your reaction? Fine.

175
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:34,155
Bring the guy then.

176
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,950
Bring your boyfriend right here.

177
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:39,695
- What? - You can't, right?

178
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:42,890
It's because Jun Ki is your boyfriend. Am I wrong?

179
00:08:42,892 --> 00:08:43,990
Gosh.

180
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:45,690
Seo Jin, bring him.

181
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,290
- What? - Bring him here...

182
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:50,760
so Dong Gu can see that nothing is going on between us.

183
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,435
Do it.

184
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,745
Well...

185
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,615
Okay. I will.

186
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,045
Really?

187
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,515
All right. Let's see.

188
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:10,285
Jun Ki. Jun Ki?

189
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:12,695
Here.

190
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:15,965
Are you okay?

191
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,435
Wait. You're bleeding.

192
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:31,745
I'm okay.

193
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:37,515
When the car hit me,

194
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:40,455
my organs must have been damaged.

195
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:43,995
But at least, Dong Gu didn't find out.

196
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,755
Do we really have to do this?

197
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:47,765
Can't we just be honest?

198
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:50,520
Who knows if he'll support us?

199
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:51,595
Hey.

200
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:54,165
I wouldn't let my sister date a guy like me.

201
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:56,290
You think Dong Gu might support us?

202
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,835
- Dream on. - Gosh.

203
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:02,230
Why did you say I should bring my boyfriend here?

204
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,470
Don't worry.

205
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:06,775
I'll ask for help from a friend, who is a good actor.

206
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:08,370
This might be a good thing.

207
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:11,580
After seeing that guy, Dong Gu will stop suspecting us.

208
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,385
Things will become easier for us.

209
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,480
Don't you think?

210
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,785
I agree, but...

211
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:20,155
Don't worry.

212
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,865
Just trust me.

213
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:25,465
- Okay? - Okay.

214
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:28,305
What are you doing?

215
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:35,030
You're so ugly.

216
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:37,900
How can you be so ugly?

217
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:40,745
Thinking of such an ugly face growing a mustache,

218
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:42,815
who would be in a relationship with you?

219
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,155
Your ugly face wakes me up.

220
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:55,625
Wait.

221
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:00,135
What's wrong?

222
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,575
I'm saying this just in case.

223
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:09,645
If there's anything between you and my sister,

224
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:12,975
once I find out,

225
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:17,185
you will no longer be alive.

226
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:20,925
Got that?

227
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:27,465
Don't worry. That won't happen.

228
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:36,535
Do you understand?

229
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:46,175
There's something suspicious about them...

230
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,745
including the fact that they kissed.

231
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:52,115
Well, I'll find out today.

232
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:58,125
If Seo Jin is dating Jun Ki, I will...

233
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:06,060
Dong Gu, I'm going to the studio.

234
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:07,195
Again?

235
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:09,835
We have a lot of work to do. Aren't you going there too often?

236
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:11,230
I finished everything.

237
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,930
I saw piles of laundry. Did you wash them?

238
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,170
I washed and hung them on the drying rack.

239
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:18,870
I saw spots on the left pillowcase on the second floor.

240
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:21,245
I washed all pillowcases.

241
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:23,170
I sanitized and changed them too.

242
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,555
- On the third-floor windows... - The curtains?

243
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:27,550
I washed and hung them on the drying rack too.

244
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,485
Really?

245
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,820
What about the one that's hanging on the third banister...

246
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:33,995
The flag?

247
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:37,025
I washed, ironed, and hung it back.

248
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:40,565
- Then you can go. - See you later.

249
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:44,875
She became meticulous.

250
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,835
She's too quick.

251
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,545
When did she do all that?

252
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,040
He bothers me.

253
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,045
Song Hyun Joon.

254
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:01,055
What on earth?

255
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:09,725
Why are you sleeping?

256
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:13,795
You startled me. What are you doing?

257
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,375
I went around Dongdaemun and couldn't get any sleep.

258
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:19,730
How dare you sleep during working hours?

259
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:23,030
Hey, I couldn't sleep at all while making the home page.

260
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,200
Forget it. Did we get any orders?

261
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:28,570
Only you and I know the home page address.

262
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:31,010
Who would visit and order?

263
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:33,185
What should we do?

264
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,455
Is there a way to advertise?

265
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:38,095
Broadcasting is the best for advertisement,

266
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,055
but it isn't easy.

267
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:42,195
Broadcasting?

268
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,465
Let me think.

269
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:49,635
Part Two of "Meet Seo Yu Ri at Noon" started.

270
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:51,800
During Part Two,

271
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:53,730
we have your favorite part where listeners sing.

272
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's connect to the first participant.

273
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,375
Hello?

274
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,645
We got it.

275
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:02,810
- Hello? - It's nice to meet you.

276
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:04,240
Could you introduce yourself?

277
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:06,715
Hello, I'm the director of an online shopping mall...

278
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:09,650
called Soorgio Armhany.

279
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,050
I'm Bong Du Shik.

280
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,850
Hello, Director Bong.

281
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:16,690
You shouldn't say the name of your company on air.

282
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,560
Is that so? I'm sorry.

283
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:22,060
We'll ignore it since you made a mistake for the first time.

284
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:25,200
Director Bong, which song will you sing?

285
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll sing "Confession" by Lim Jae Bum.

286
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:30,975
"Confession"? That's a difficult song.

287
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,875
Let's hear it.

288
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,985
What should I do?

289
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:47,225
What am I supposed to do?

290
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:51,695
I'm not good enough

291
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:55,435
However

292
00:14:56,165 --> 00:15:00,835
I love her

293
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:06,445
Let me go quietly, Soo Ah

294
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:13,115
I don't know either, Soo Ah

295
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:17,850
Soorgio Armhany

296
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:21,065
Shopping Mall

297
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,095
Soo Ah

298
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:26,565
The call got cut off.

299
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:30,160
I apologize for not having a stable connection.

300
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,460
Let's connect to the next participant.

301
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,675
Hello?

302
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:35,845
Hello?

303
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,640
It's nice to meet you. Could you introduce yourself?

304
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:41,810
I'm Min Soo Ah from Huam-dong.

305
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,740
Which song would you like to sing?

306
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:46,555
I'll sing "Crooked" by G-Dragon.

307
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:48,550
"Crooked" by G-Dragon.

308
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:50,885
Let's hear it right away.

309
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:57,225
Nothing ever lasts forever

310
00:15:57,393 --> 00:16:00,735
In the end, you changed

311
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:02,730
- There's no reason - Soo Ah

312
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:04,560
- Nothing is sincere - Soo Ah

313
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,945
Shopping Mall Soorgio Armhany

314
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:11,445
- Shopping Mall Soorgio Armhany - Shopping Mall Soorgio Armhany

315
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:13,670
Shopping Mall...

316
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:15,045
Darn it.

317
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:18,655
She has no manners for her listeners.

318
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,180
Wouldn't you hang up if you were her?

319
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:23,280
What else could we do? This is all we could do.

320
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:24,820
But we were amazing, right?

321
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,925
Yes, you sang well.

322
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,200
It's delicious.

323
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:42,605
- Really? - It's really delicious.

324
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,145
I'm so glad.

325
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:48,545
Actually, I'm most confident with making muffins.

326
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,670
I even came up with a name...

327
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,955
for my future bakery after Sol.

328
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:55,155
Really? What's the name?

329
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:59,455
Sol, Sol, Green Sol's Muffin.

330
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:03,865
I see. The name is quite unique.

331
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:08,305
- Is this the recipe? - Yes.

332
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,405
I made the recipe myself.

333
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:19,345
Are you saying that he's your boyfriend?

334
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,585
- Yes. - Be quiet.

335
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:24,415
Are you really Seo Jin's boyfriend?

336
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,585
Hi, hi.

337
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,955
Yes, I enjoy wearing a red coat.

338
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:35,525
While we were kissing in the park...

339
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:38,435
You screamed like that,

340
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:42,335
so I was startled and ran away.

341
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:45,475
I'm Seo Jin's boyfriend, Kang Hong Seok.

342
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:52,145
Hong Seok is a musical actor, so he makes big gestures.

343
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,345
He's expressive.

344
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,285
He is.

345
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:58,555
How did you meet Seo Jin?

346
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:03,155
Hey.

347
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,525
What's wrong with the lights?

348
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,235
The first time we met was before a performance.

349
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:19,105
Seo Jin entered the stage to make a report.

350
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:22,605
Step by step,

351
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,175
she walked in while clacking her shoes.

352
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:28,645
Then my heart pounded all of a sudden.

353
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:31,685
It started to pound.

354
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,155
I started to hear music that sang of our fate.

355
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,595
At this moment

356
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,390
Everything of me

357
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:48,065
I'll risk my body and my soul

358
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:50,490
I'll throw everything

359
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,360
I'll dedicate my all to you

360
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,100
I've been looking desperately for you

361
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:59,370
My destiny, Kang Seo Jin

362
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:06,685
For you

363
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:15,225
By the way, where's the bathroom?

364
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:18,435
Pardon? The bathroom?

365
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:20,535
It's over there.

366
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:23,890
- Over there? - Yes.

367
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:25,835
Please excuse me.

368
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:28,575
Step by step.

369
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:31,245
Step by step.

370
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,675
What did I tell you?

371
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,615
There's nothing between me and Seo Jin.

372
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:37,685
It seems a little strange,

373
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:42,255
but it's better than dating you.

374
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,055
What did you say?

375
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,020
What's wrong with me?

376
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,095
Be glad that it isn't you.

377
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,850
If you were dating Seo Jin,

378
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,535
once I find out,

379
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,835
you will no longer be alive.

380
00:19:58,534 --> 00:19:59,700
I told you that I understood.

381
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,100
Stop saying that. You're frightening me.

382
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:03,005
You sound like the grim reaper.

383
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:08,770
You want me to do this?

384
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:10,240
Is this necessary?

385
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:13,410
We have to advertise our shopping mall somehow.

386
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:15,510
Gosh. What's going on?

387
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:17,895
What's all this noise?

388
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:19,280
Dong Gu.

389
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:20,780
What's all this? Look at you two.

390
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:21,790
What are you guys doing?

391
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,290
Us? We're about to do a webcast.

392
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,690
We have to promote our online shopping site.

393
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:27,365
Is that right?

394
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,335
- But what's that on your face? - What?

395
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,330
Are you talking about this?

396
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:35,700
Last time when Seo Jin shaved her beard, it went viral.

397
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:37,500
I thought I'd try shaving on our webcast,

398
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:39,345
so I made it look like I have a beard.

399
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,845
I see.

400
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:45,755
Then what are those bones for? Are they dinosaur bones?

401
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:47,710
Can you believe this? She wants me...

402
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:49,850
to eat bones like Jun Ki did.

403
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:50,955
On top of that,

404
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,525
she gave me these hard cow legs.

405
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,250
Jun Ki ate pigs' feet bones.

406
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:58,765
You should eat something tougher to get more viewers.

407
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:00,965
Gosh. Just do it.

408
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:03,030
Viewers are logging on.

409
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,090
(BJ Soorgio and BJ Armhany's Shaving and Eating Show)

410
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,675
Now, let's get this started, Du Shik.

411
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:09,575
"Gangnam Parvenu", hello.

412
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:13,215
I'm the hottest BJ bursting onto the shaving webcast scene.

413
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:15,945
I'm BJ Soorgio.

414
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,285
Hello. I'm the handsome BJ in the bone-eating webcast scene.

415
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:21,785
I'm BJ Armhany.

416
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:24,525
Then we'll get started...

417
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:28,620
with our bone-eating and shaving webcast show.

418
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:31,465
First, I'll put on some shaving cream.

419
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:38,375
What do you think you're doing? Hurry up, and eat the bones.

420
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,345
Du Shik.

421
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:47,175
Jun Ki. Your first shooting is coming up. Is practice going well?

422
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:50,615
I don't know. I'm doing my best,

423
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:53,885
but honestly, I'm a bit worried and anxious.

424
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,480
Cheer up. I'm sure you'll do a great job.

425
00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:58,780
I can always rely on you. You're the only one...

426
00:21:58,787 --> 00:22:00,480
that truly worries about me, Bacca.

427
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,190
You're grateful, aren't you?

428
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,620
Then shouldn't I be getting a reward?

429
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,135
A reward? What kind of reward?

430
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:07,535
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.

431
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:11,065
What?

432
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:13,175
- Again? - Yes.

433
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:15,570
What if Dong gu catches us again?

434
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:16,830
I doubt it.

435
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:18,615
We should still be careful.

436
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:20,615
Didn't you hear what Dong Gu said yesterday?

437
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:25,085
You will no longer be alive.

438
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:29,380
Just the thought of that...

439
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:31,355
sends chills up my spine.

440
00:22:31,386 --> 00:22:33,155
Still. Please?

441
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,560
Gosh. How could I refuse?

442
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,365
You adorable little Bacca.

443
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,935
Get those cute lips ready.

444
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:46,405
Get ready. Here I go.

445
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:48,705
I'll show you how it should be done.

446
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:54,215
What's am seeing now?

447
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:57,845
Hey! Seo Jin!

448
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:00,940
Who is that? It's Dong Gu, isn't it?

449
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:02,185
Oh, dear. What should we do?

450
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,880
Seo Jin. Who is it? Who is he?

451
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,055
Who is he?

452
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:08,165
What? What was that?

453
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,595
What just happened?

454
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,565
Wait a minute.

455
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:16,230
Seo Jin. How could you?

456
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:17,505
It's not what you think.

457
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:19,005
Who are you trying to fool?

458
00:23:20,102 --> 00:23:22,175
- That hurts. Wait. - Come with me. Follow me.

459
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,245
Seo Jin.

460
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,775
Hong Seok said he's at the theater.

461
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:29,145
Then who was that jerk earlier?

462
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:31,410
Hold on.

463
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:35,485
As I think of it, from the back, he looked just like Jun Ki.

464
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:38,580
What are you saying? It wasn't Jun Ki.

465
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:40,220
Then who was it?

466
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:42,925
Who on earth was that guy kissing you?

467
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:44,125
Well, you see,

468
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,690
- it was my boyfriend. - What? Your boyfriend?

469
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:50,035
What about Hong Seok?

470
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:52,660
Then do you mean you're two-timing?

471
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:53,775
What?

472
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:55,845
Yes.

473
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:58,275
I met him while I was out covering a case today.

474
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,040
I couldn't help myself.

475
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:02,340
You actually kissed someone that you just met today?

476
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:04,370
I can't control myself these days.

477
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:06,040
I'm a bit sexually frustrated.

478
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,325
Do you actually expect me to believe that?

479
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:12,180
Yes, Director.

480
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:13,850
Thank you for giving me a ride home.

481
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:15,965
Drive home safely. Goodbye.

482
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,590
Look at that.

483
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:21,320
The back of your head looks exactly like that jerk.

484
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,330
What on earth are you talking about?

485
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,490
Don't try to deny it.

486
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:27,830
It was you that was kissing Seo Jin in the park earlier, right?

487
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,105
What are you talking about?

488
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:32,175
I've been practicing my lines with the director until now.

489
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:35,615
Wait a minute. Seo Jin was kissing a guy again?

490
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:39,685
You've completely lost your mind. You just love kissing, don't you?

491
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:43,110
So you're telling me that jerk wasn't you?

492
00:24:43,118 --> 00:24:44,355
Fine.

493
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:46,750
Then go bring your boyfriend over here.

494
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:48,265
- Bring him over. - This instant!

495
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:51,120
What? Right now?

496
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,560
Why are you surprised?

497
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:54,695
I'm not surprised at all.

498
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,030
Seo Jin. Just bring him over.

499
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,730
- What? - Bring him over.

500
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:00,200
You can bring him over.

501
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:02,145
I have your back. Go ahead, and bring him.

502
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:04,940
Prove that you and I are just close friends.

503
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,275
Prove that to Dong Gu.

504
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:08,910
Go right ahead. Please prove that to me.

505
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,345
Call him!

506
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:12,980
What are you doing! I need to see him today!

507
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:15,085
- Bring him over! - This instant!

508
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:16,755
All right.

509
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:24,835
Why are you dressed like that?

510
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,060
You see, I was in the middle of shooting a historical drama...

511
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:30,035
when I was casted at the last minute.

512
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,005
You were casted?

513
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:34,105
What I meant to say was...

514
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:36,900
I suddenly received a call...

515
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:38,800
from my girlfriend, Bang Seo Jin.

516
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:40,645
Did you say Bang Seo Jin?

517
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:44,240
Did I get her name wrong?

518
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:46,280
- Pardon? - To be honest,

519
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,380
we just decided to start dating today,

520
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:51,555
so I don't know her name quite well.

521
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:53,595
Of course. That's possible.

522
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:56,450
I learned my girlfriend's name three months after we started dating.

523
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,190
- Is that right? - Anyhow,

524
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:01,420
I can assure you that I'm Seo Jin's boyfriend.

525
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,890
If you don't mind, if you're done checking,

526
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:05,535
may I go now?

527
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,130
You see, I'm scheduled to be poisoned in 30 minutes.

528
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:11,100
I see. Then you should get going.

529
00:26:11,106 --> 00:26:12,215
I'll be leaving now then.

530
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:19,315
Did you see that? I told you it wasn't me.

531
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:24,585
All right. That guy's also kind of strange,

532
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,755
but it's better than having Seo Jin date you.

533
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:30,150
As if two-timing weren't enough,

534
00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:32,120
I think kissing on your first date is too much.

535
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,660
Seo Jin. Don't you think you're being a bit too easy?

536
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:35,865
I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

537
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:39,405
I never know I could be so easy.

538
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,805
- I'm sorry. - You're making me worry.

539
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:50,070
We still don't have a single visitor.

540
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:51,270
(Visitors: None)

541
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,385
We've already bought a bunch of clothes. I'm so worried.

542
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:56,525
Gosh, my molars.

543
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:58,625
It's all Soo Ah's fault.

544
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:03,190
Director Bong. Follow me.

545
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,290
Follow you where?

546
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,760
We can't just sit back and wait all day.

547
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:09,105
We should try whatever we can. Come with me.

548
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:11,660
- Where are we going this time? - Just come with me.

549
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:14,575
What on earth do you have planned this time, Soo Ah?

550
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:16,130
Hello, we're from an online shopping mall,

551
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:17,630
- Hello, please visit... - "Soorgio Armhany".

552
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,315
"Soorgio Armhany", our online shopping mall.

553
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:21,870
Please visit "Soorgio Armhany", our online shopping mall.

554
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:24,915
Please try searching our site online.

555
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:33,125
Soo Ah. We've done enough.

556
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:35,795
This won't help promote our website.

557
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:38,150
Who promotes shopping sites with leaflets these days anyway?

558
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,220
Then what should we do? We have no other choice.

559
00:27:40,228 --> 00:27:41,905
We should at least do whatever we can.

560
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,360
If you want to leave, go alone.

561
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:45,005
I won't go back until I give out all of these today.

562
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Hey. Wait.

563
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:48,160
Please visit "Soorgio Armhany", our online shopping mall.

564
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:49,505
Thank you in advance.

565
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,795
("Soorgio Armhany" Grand Opening Event)

566
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,235
I told you we should stop doing this.

567
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:14,695
Let's go now, okay?

568
00:28:16,331 --> 00:28:18,105
Soo Ah.

569
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:20,035
Are you crying?

570
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,275
Du Shik.

571
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:23,905
What's wrong with me?

572
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:28,245
Why can't I ever do anything right?

573
00:28:31,112 --> 00:28:33,185
I really worked hard on this.

574
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:37,655
I really wanted to do this right this time.

575
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:45,495
- Get up. - Don't mind me.

576
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,960
I'm going to stay here. You go ahead.

577
00:28:47,963 --> 00:28:50,865
Just get up. I'm hungry.

578
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:54,330
How could you possibly be hungry at a time like this?

579
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:57,430
We should eat something if we're going to continue handing these out.

580
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,770
- What? - Also,

581
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:01,845
how can an employee leave first when the boss is still working?

582
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:04,085
So get up already.

583
00:29:20,462 --> 00:29:21,930
Here. Drink this.

584
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,730
No thanks. I'm not hungry.

585
00:29:23,732 --> 00:29:26,435
Don't be stubborn. Drink some. Go ahead.

586
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,615
Don't move! Don't move!

587
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:42,085
Everyone, get down on the floor!

588
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,750
If you all don't want to die, get down on the floor!

589
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:47,295
- Is that a gun in his hand? - What?

590
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:50,395
It's a gun. It's a gun.

591
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:51,790
What on earth is going on?

592
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:52,965
You two right there.

593
00:29:53,128 --> 00:29:54,890
Get down on the floor. Get down now.

594
00:29:54,896 --> 00:29:56,065
Yes, sir.

595
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:01,535
- Hyun Joon. - Hello. Welcome.

596
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:04,270
Hello. Why did you suddenly ask me to come here?

597
00:30:04,272 --> 00:30:07,100
You see, I have something I'd like to show you.

598
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:11,045
(Sol, Sol, Green Sol's Muffin)

599
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:12,685
What's this?

600
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,785
I'm a businessman.

601
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,850
Your muffins seemed competitive,

602
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:19,895
so I launched them. What do you think?

603
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:21,220
Really?

604
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:23,050
I followed every letter of your recipe.

605
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:26,320
My shop will take care of the manufacturing and selling.

606
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,830
But the profits will be shared with you equally.

607
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,035
Do you have any objections?

608
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:32,475
No, I don't.

609
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:34,305
Thank you so much.

610
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:36,345
I appreciate it, Hyun Joon.

611
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:39,245
I look forward to working with you, Patissier Han.

612
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:48,885
Park Doo Cheol, it's still not too late.

613
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,455
Drop your weapons, and surrender!

614
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,150
Cut it out!

615
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:56,090
If you want to save the hostages, get lost!

616
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:58,595
How long will this go on?

617
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:02,035
Wait.

618
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:04,260
It must be being broadcast.

619
00:31:04,265 --> 00:31:05,435
That's right.

620
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:07,475
There are so many cameras.

621
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,645
Hold on. Du Shik.

622
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:13,915
These things are usually broadcast live, right?

623
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:15,815
I guess so. What about it?

624
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,040
It's an opportunity to promote our shopping mall.

625
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:20,010
It must be being broadcast live all over the country now.

626
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:22,325
Are you saying you want to promote our shopping mall right now?

627
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:23,555
Are you crazy?

628
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:25,795
You stay here.

629
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:28,055
- Let me take care of it. - Don't do anything.

630
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,965
He might shoot you. Stay still.

631
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,535
Stop it.

632
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:35,065
Don't do anything.

633
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:38,735
- Look at that. - What is she doing?

634
00:31:46,508 --> 00:31:48,615
Hey, what are you doing right now?

635
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,770
Well, sir,

636
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,115
can't I just stand here?

637
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:54,885
I'll still be your hostage...

638
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,450
regardless of whether I'm standing or lying down.

639
00:31:57,452 --> 00:31:59,025
- She's lost her mind. - What?

640
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,480
Have you lost your mind?

641
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:01,695
Get down.

642
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,090
Get down right now.

643
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:05,125
I have my reasons.

644
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,235
I've already given up on my life.

645
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:09,035
Do you want to die with me?

646
00:32:16,204 --> 00:32:18,205
You're not the only one who is going through a hard time.

647
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,045
What?

648
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:22,785
I don't know about your situation,

649
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:24,845
but I wouldn't think mine is any better.

650
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:27,710
I was conned...

651
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:29,425
and lost all my money.

652
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:30,925
On top of that,

653
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,495
I'm living off my ex-boyfriend, who I dumped.

654
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:36,065
Really?

655
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:39,965
What's worse, my ex-boyfriend likes someone else now.

656
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,165
He even asks me for dating advice.

657
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:46,175
It's so humiliating.

658
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:47,705
What a jerk.

659
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:52,215
My online shopping mall was my last hope,

660
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,775
but it's about to close down.

661
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:58,085
So please just let me stand here.

662
00:32:58,446 --> 00:33:00,985
Will you, sir?

663
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:06,055
Why are you crying?

664
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:09,595
People are watching. Stop crying.

665
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:11,050
I can't believe these guys.

666
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,195
Gosh.

667
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:31,485
Soo Bong's lessons sure helped.

668
00:33:33,348 --> 00:33:34,785
Bacca, what's wrong?

669
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:37,285
- What is it? - You really don't know?

670
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:39,150
You made me look easy.

671
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:41,650
I couldn't help it because of Dong Gu.

672
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,295
How long do we have to do this?

673
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:45,935
- Forever? - You know what Dong Gu is like.

674
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,930
He'll kill me if he finds out.

675
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,635
Why are you such a coward?

676
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:52,860
- Are you that scared of my brother? - Yes.

677
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,175
I really am.

678
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:56,770
I don't want to die yet.

679
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:58,375
Forget it. It's over.

680
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:00,215
Let's just break up.

681
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:02,945
Wait. What are you talking about?

682
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:05,085
What's the matter?

683
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,380
Hey. Seo Jin.

684
00:34:08,383 --> 00:34:09,750
Stop it. Let go of me.

685
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:12,155
- I can't. I won't. - Let go.

686
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:14,825
Seo Jin.

687
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,395
Is it Dong Gu again?

688
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:20,735
Gosh. Again?

689
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,460
Let's just tell him the truth.

690
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:23,760
I can't. He'll kill me.

691
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:25,165
Are you serious?

692
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:28,430
Stay right there.

693
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:30,005
- Okay? - I'm sorry, Seo Jin.

694
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:31,805
Come here.

695
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:40,515
What was that? Is he a human being or a cheetah?

696
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,210
Seo Jin. Who is that guy?

697
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:45,595
Whatever!

698
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:48,025
- Gosh. - What?

699
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:49,695
How dare she yell at me?

700
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:51,425
Hey! Seo Jin!

701
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,195
A woman suppressed the gunman with nothing but her bare hands.

702
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:57,505
Let's hear from her.

703
00:34:58,399 --> 00:34:59,605
Hello.

704
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:01,460
Hello.

705
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:04,670
I run an online shopping mall called "Soorgio Armhany",

706
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:07,815
Soo Ah Mall for short. My name is Min Soo Ah.

707
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:11,410
It must not have been easy to suppress the gunman.

708
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:12,580
Of course not.

709
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,210
But Soorgio Armhany's company mission...

710
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:18,250
is the realization of a just society.

711
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:19,425
What?

712
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:21,825
With highest-quality products, reasonable prices,

713
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:25,265
and fast delivery service, Soorgio Armhany will always...

714
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,260
be there for you...

715
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:28,765
who wish for a just society.

716
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:30,805
Our address is...

717
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:32,635
Tell me the truth.

718
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,930
Who were you hugging?

719
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:36,230
I don't know.

720
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:39,045
If you don't know him, why were you hugging him?

721
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,170
He was passing by, and I thought he looked nice.

722
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:42,385
You know I'm easy!

723
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:45,885
Why are you so angry?

724
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:49,610
I was just worried if you were dating Jun Ki.

725
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:52,220
Do you hate him that much?

726
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,155
What? Hey.

727
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:56,420
Why would I hate Jun Ki?

728
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:58,395
I like him.

729
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,995
He is a bit immature, but he's kind-hearted.

730
00:36:02,397 --> 00:36:03,765
He's thoughtful too.

731
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,265
But...

732
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:09,205
I still don't want my sister to date him. That's all.

733
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,675
Really?

734
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:14,775
I'm asking you this out of curiosity.

735
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:17,585
What would you do if I really was dating Jun Ki?

736
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,140
Would you hit him or something?

737
00:36:19,147 --> 00:36:21,555
Are you crazy? I couldn't hit him.

738
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,325
- But if you really were together, - Yes?

739
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:27,825
you'll have to pay the price.

740
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:31,725
Me? What do you mean?

741
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:34,595
I know this small temple...

742
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:37,265
deep in the mountains of Gangwon Province.

743
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:39,600
It's very beautiful and clean there.

744
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,005
You can't find a living soul around there.

745
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:43,600
And?

746
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:46,475
If I had to see you go out with Jun Ki,

747
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:51,345
I'd rather shave off all your hair...

748
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:53,985
and turn you into a Buddhist nun.

749
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:55,710
A nun?

750
00:36:55,716 --> 00:37:01,155
The world and I are one

751
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:03,825
In addition, you won't be allowed to use a razor.

752
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:18,345
You know I'm not joking, right?

753
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,585
Yes, I do. I know that very well.

754
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:28,440
Hey, Dong Gu.

755
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:31,455
What happened? Why did he drink so much?

756
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:34,655
Hey.

757
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:37,925
I have something to confess to you.

758
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,435
You want to confess something? What is it?

759
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:47,730
What is it?

760
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:51,745
I'll be a man and tell you everything.

761
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:54,815
Me and...

762
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,685
Seo Jin...

763
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,865
Seo Jin, what are you doing?

764
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:13,295
He was so noisy.

765
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:16,135
He should just go to bed. I can't stand him anymore.

766
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,835
There's nothing I like about him.

767
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:25,845
Why does she hate Jun Ki so much?

768
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,745
I mean...

769
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,545
I really didn't have to suspect them.

770
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:34,115
Jun Ki, are you okay? Hey.

771
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,925
Bacca, did something happen last night while I was drunk?

772
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:42,155
I remember coming home,

773
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:44,865
but I blacked out after that.

774
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,135
Well...

775
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:49,305
You fell down.

776
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:50,865
Really?

777
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:54,175
Anyway, I'm sorry.

778
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:56,930
I'll tell Dong Gu about us today...

779
00:38:56,938 --> 00:38:59,715
- even if he might beat me to death. - What?

780
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,485
No. Don't tell him.

781
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,415
- Why not? - I've thought about it,

782
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,885
and I decided that we should probably keep it a secret.

783
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:13,255
So let's just keep it from him from now on, okay?

784
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,455
All right.

785
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:17,925
Then I'm leaving for a shoot now.

786
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:20,190
Already? Isn't it in the afternoon?

787
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,535
- Why are you leaving so early? - I should go early and rehearse.

788
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:25,360
I'm shooting with Min Ki Young today.

789
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:27,800
Really? You must be so nervous.

790
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:29,875
My heart is about to burst.

791
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:34,915
Then should I give you some energy?

792
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:37,515
Give me some energy? How?

793
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:44,485
What do you think? Do you feel more energy now?

794
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,925
Yes. I have so much energy now.

795
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:49,725
It's out of control. What should I do?

796
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:55,890
What are you doing?

797
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:57,260
What if Dong Gu sees us?

798
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:58,605
I don't care.

799
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:06,975
(Expenditure for "Codename Dubai")

800
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:09,415
We have another order.

801
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:13,380
You seem to be getting some orders now.

802
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:15,685
It's probably because of the advertisement.

803
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,255
It's all thanks to me. You know that, right?

804
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:21,980
By the way, where's Yoon Ah?

805
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:23,850
She went to the bakery.

806
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:25,690
What? At this early hour?

807
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:28,260
I heard Hyun Joon let her sell...

808
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:29,530
her muffins at his bakery.

809
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,205
He's even sharing profits with her.

810
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:34,635
Really?

811
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:37,830
Du Shik, what are you reading?

812
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:40,140
- Is it fun? - It is.

813
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:41,245
What is it about?

814
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,240
This is about a man...

815
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:46,140
who pretends to be terminally ill to stay next to the woman he loves.

816
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:48,315
His love is so sad.

817
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:50,880
What? He pretends to be ill...

818
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:52,655
to stay next to his love?

819
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:54,920
He's lying.

820
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:57,950
That's not sad. That's cowardly.

821
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,495
- What do you mean? - It's true.

822
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:03,805
It's just like someone who lets Yoon Ah sell muffins at his place.

823
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:07,230
How can a man do that? He's such a coward.

824
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:09,245
Don't you think so?

825
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,575
Scum.

826
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:13,615
(Expenditure for "Codename Dubai")

827
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:17,415
(A Real Man)

828
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:24,310
Hello.

829
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,725
- Hello. - Hello.

830
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:27,950
Hello.

831
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:30,290
Jun Ki, you know him, right? You should introduce yourself.

832
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:32,735
Sure. Hello, sir.

833
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:34,860
It's an honor to meet you like this.

834
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:38,260
I'm Lee Jun Ki, acting as Song Jun Seok.

835
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:41,975
Are you the one acting as Song Jun Seok?

836
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:45,345
- Pardon? - Are you Song Jun Seok?

837
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:49,510
Yes, sir.

838
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,285
You look really kind.

839
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,355
Let's make this work.

840
00:41:58,385 --> 00:41:59,980
Jun Ki, why are you laughing?

841
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:03,265
His pronunciation is a little...

842
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,460
He recently had a tongue surgery,

843
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,820
so he can't pronounce certain sounds.

844
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:11,035
He'll get better soon. Don't worry.

845
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:12,365
Really?

846
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,735
Get ready. Cue.

847
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:18,605
Sir, I can't follow your order.

848
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,145
I have to get this news out.

849
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,440
What?

850
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:25,885
Even if I lose my position as an anchor...

851
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:30,485
Even if I die, I'll announce this report.

852
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:32,085
Do you understand?

853
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,095
How could you do this to me, Song Jun Seok?

854
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:39,195
Don't you know what I've done for you, Song Jun Seok?

855
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:42,665
Cut.

856
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:45,635
Jun Ki, why are you curling your lips like that?

857
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,700
I... I'm sorry.

858
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:51,775
My lips are dry.

859
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:53,470
I'm sorry, sir.

860
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:55,915
It's fine. It's just because you're nervous.

861
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:57,470
Let's continue.

862
00:42:57,478 --> 00:42:59,380
We'll start from your line, sir.

863
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,485
All right.

864
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:04,055
Cue!

865
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:06,855
I've been so good to you, Jun Seok!

866
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,265
- Why do you keep laughing? - Sorry?

867
00:43:13,294 --> 00:43:14,895
Why do you keep laughing?

868
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:16,405
Do you think my acting is funny?

869
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,160
No, it's not like that.

870
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,175
Stop it. Director Kim,

871
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:23,075
let's continue later.

872
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:27,115
I'm sorry.

873
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:28,715
I'm sorry.

874
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:31,010
Why do you keep laughing?

875
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:34,440
His pronunciations make me laugh.

876
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,910
But still, you shouldn't laugh when he's acting.

877
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:38,810
Be careful, all right?

878
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:39,895
I'm sorry.

879
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:42,295
Sir.

880
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:45,865
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

881
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:47,465
Gosh.

882
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:50,065
Why do I keep laughing?

883
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,535
Song Jun Seok.

884
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,035
I must be crazy.

885
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:57,770
Now, we're nearly done.

886
00:43:57,771 --> 00:44:00,340
- What happened to the hunting? - I'm looking into it.

887
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:02,745
He gave a spot to Yoon Ah?

888
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,780
He's going to keep her by his side by using bread?

889
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,480
- That scum. - Next,

890
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:13,280
when Shin Hyun Joon slips into the party room at the Dubai hotel,

891
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:15,965
where do you think he should hide his air rifle?

892
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,050
- I've been thinking. - All right.

893
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:19,935
There are musicians at the parties, right?

894
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:23,060
What if he hides it in an instrument case?

895
00:44:23,063 --> 00:44:26,130
They already used that in "Mission Impossible".

896
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:29,035
Don't you have any fresh ideas?

897
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:32,105
Hey, he's doing that again.

898
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,315
He must have an idea.

899
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:38,485
Dong Gu, can you think of anything?

900
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,355
Bread!

901
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:42,680
Bread? What about it?

902
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:43,680
What?

903
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:45,810
A bread that we can eat?

904
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,255
So you want to hide the air rifle in a bread?

905
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:51,850
- That's a new idea. - Gosh.

906
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:54,020
How can you hide a big rifle in a bread?

907
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:56,630
We can make a long bread.

908
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,690
There will be food at parties.

909
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,005
It'd be natural.

910
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:03,475
Dong Gu, you got this one again.

911
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,940
I think you're ready to be a director now.

912
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:09,615
- It's great. You did so well. - Thank you.

913
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:13,410
You're ahead of me again.

914
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:15,155
I thought of bread too.

915
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,925
- Go easy on me. - What?

916
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,195
I'm sorry.

917
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,905
What brings you here, Dong Gu?

918
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:38,570
You're here to see Yoon Ah.

919
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:40,740
No. I only came here...

920
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,470
to look for movie props.

921
00:45:42,476 --> 00:45:44,015
But where's Yoon Ah?

922
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:47,610
She's in the workroom. Do you want me to call her?

923
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:49,015
No thanks.

924
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:50,380
I heard...

925
00:45:50,384 --> 00:45:53,050
you got her a spot to sell her muffins.

926
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:54,895
Yes, right here.

927
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:57,990
(Sol, Sol, Green Sol's Muffin)

928
00:45:57,992 --> 00:45:59,295
So this was it.

929
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:03,760
I didn't think of you like this, but you're cheaper than I thought.

930
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:04,930
What do you mean?

931
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,760
You want to gain her affection...

932
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,005
by getting her a spot.

933
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:10,930
How can a man be so cheap...

934
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:12,800
to take advantage by using bread like that?

935
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:14,545
- What? - Enough about that.

936
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:18,285
Do you have any bread that might fit an air rifle?

937
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:19,840
Why put an air rifle in a bread?

938
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:22,440
It's something we need for our film.

939
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,625
I don't think you'd understand.

940
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:27,480
In that case, can you make bread...

941
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:29,155
that can fit an air rifle?

942
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:30,620
Just plain ones.

943
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:32,150
Sure. It won't be so difficult.

944
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:34,235
Then make 20 of them...

945
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:37,760
big enough to fit air rifles, okay?

946
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:38,935
All right.

947
00:46:40,434 --> 00:46:42,160
What are you doing here, Dong Gu?

948
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:45,775
I'm here to look for props to use in my film.

949
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,645
- I'm going now. - Bye.

950
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:50,345
Gosh, Hyun Joon.

951
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:54,115
Be a man, all right? Be a man.

952
00:47:04,258 --> 00:47:06,095
How can a man be so cowardly?

953
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:07,760
I can't live like that.

954
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:09,665
How cheap of him.

955
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:15,805
My legs!

956
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:19,405
Dong Gu!

957
00:47:19,907 --> 00:47:21,270
- Dong Gu, are you all right? - Just calm down.

958
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,475
- Just stay calm. - What should we do?

959
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:25,140
Don't touch my legs!

960
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:26,655
Just stay calm, okay?

961
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:27,810
Are you all right?

962
00:47:27,815 --> 00:47:30,385
Please call an ambulance.

963
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,426
- Hello, Jun Ki. - Hello.

964
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,529
Why do you look so sad?

965
00:47:42,796 --> 00:47:44,064
Did something happen?

966
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:46,366
I nearly got fired.

967
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:48,735
What? Why?

968
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:51,305
Min Ki Young hurt his tongue,

969
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:53,974
so he can't pronounce certain sounds.

970
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:55,008
Okay.

971
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:58,846
And he can't pronounce the name of my role.

972
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:00,280
So?

973
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:02,549
Whenever he pronounces my name,

974
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:06,086
he sounds so funny.

975
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:09,123
So I was told off for laughing during the shooting.

976
00:48:09,123 --> 00:48:11,959
What? Song Jun Seok?

977
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,093
Yes.

978
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,330
And he says my name...

979
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,499
with such a stern expression.

980
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:21,001
I couldn't hold back my laughter.

981
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:24,471
I understand. I always laugh at the same thing too.

982
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,574
I need to shoot with him again tomorrow.

983
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,943
What should I do?

984
00:48:35,983 --> 00:48:37,084
Dong Gu.

985
00:48:38,886 --> 00:48:41,021
What happened? Why are you in a wheelchair?

986
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:43,757
Dong Gu got hurt.

987
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:45,192
What happened?

988
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:48,128
It's nothing. Don't make a big fuss.

989
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:51,565
Yoon Ah, can you take me to my room?

990
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:52,633
Sure.

991
00:48:57,704 --> 00:48:59,006
It's a big problem.

992
00:48:59,406 --> 00:49:01,241
Both your legs were hurt.

993
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:02,576
He can't even move.

994
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:03,710
I know.

995
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:05,546
We can help today,

996
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:07,915
but tomorrow, we all need to go outside for work.

997
00:49:07,915 --> 00:49:10,450
Don't worry. I'll stay next to him.

998
00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:12,686
Then what about your classes and the bakery?

999
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:15,022
I can skip class for a few days.

1000
00:49:15,022 --> 00:49:17,157
And I'll ask Hyun Joon about the bakery.

1001
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:21,695
Dong Gu, tell me if you need anything.

1002
00:49:21,695 --> 00:49:23,664
- Okay? - Okay.

1003
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:27,201
I'll get some rest for now, Yoon Ah.

1004
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,172
Let's go.

1005
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:41,381
It means that she won't see him.

1006
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:43,183
I'm glad that I got injured.

1007
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:45,118
I got injured perfectly.

1008
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:52,593
I slept so well.

1009
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:58,498
Shall I go to the bathroom?

1010
00:50:07,774 --> 00:50:08,909
It doesn't hurt.

1011
00:50:10,277 --> 00:50:11,478
I'm really fine.

1012
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:13,914
I'm so relieved.

1013
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:18,452
Are you awake, Dong Gu?

1014
00:50:20,554 --> 00:50:21,888
Are your legs okay?

1015
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:24,491
They're fine after getting some sleep.

1016
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:26,827
I'm happy to hear that.

1017
00:50:27,928 --> 00:50:31,064
Dong Gu, then I'll go to the bakery.

1018
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:32,833
I'm worried about work.

1019
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,769
What? Then is she going to that guy's bakery again?

1020
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,838
Gosh, that's not good.

1021
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:43,610
My legs.

1022
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:45,879
Dong Gu.

1023
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:48,282
What's wrong, Dong Gu?

1024
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:51,251
I thought I was fine, but I was wrong.

1025
00:50:51,251 --> 00:50:53,754
Gosh, I feel pain.

1026
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:56,490
They hurt more than yesterday. What should I do?

1027
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:00,060
I can't do anything alone.

1028
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,628
Really?

1029
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:04,464
- What's wrong all of a sudden? - I'm sorry, Yoon Ah.

1030
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:07,067
You have to go to the bakery.

1031
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:09,403
No, don't worry.

1032
00:51:09,636 --> 00:51:11,938
- I'll lay you down. - Okay.

1033
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:34,961
Hello, sir.

1034
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:42,235
I'm sorry about yesterday.

1035
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:43,870
Please forgive me.

1036
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,207
Right.

1037
00:51:47,808 --> 00:51:50,644
Don't do it again, okay?

1038
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:52,612
I won't, sir.

1039
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:57,417
- Have you eaten? - No, not yet.

1040
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:00,887
If not, do you want some sandwich?

1041
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:04,758
Thank you.

1042
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:09,629
Have some apple juice too.

1043
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:15,469
What's wrong with you?

1044
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,472
It's nothing.

1045
00:52:19,906 --> 00:52:21,241
Thank you.

1046
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,311
Goodness.

1047
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,420
"Sandwich" and "apple juice".

1048
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:36,356
That's hilarious.

1049
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,092
It's funny whenever he talks.

1050
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:45,432
What if I burst out laughing when he calls me again?

1051
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,803
No, it won't be many times.

1052
00:52:50,604 --> 00:52:52,572
I should keep from laughing by pinching my thigh.

1053
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,109
Gosh, it's a waste of a sandwich.

1054
00:52:56,576 --> 00:52:58,412
Hey, Jun Ki.

1055
00:52:58,612 --> 00:53:00,414
The writer changed the script.

1056
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:02,349
There aren't many changes, so memorize them quickly.

1057
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:03,517
Okay.

1058
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:04,918
Oh, that's right.

1059
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,689
(Song Jun Seok, Song Jun Seok...)

1060
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:10,891
"Song Jun Seok".

1061
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,498
Let's start the shoot.

1062
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:21,401
Get ready. Cue.

1063
00:53:21,802 --> 00:53:25,138
Sir, I can't follow your order.

1064
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:29,609
- I have to get this news out. - What?

1065
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:31,878
Even if I lose my position as an anchor...

1066
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:35,449
Even if I die, I'll announce this report.

1067
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:36,883
Do you understand?

1068
00:53:36,983 --> 00:53:39,653
Song Jun Seok, Song Jun Seok, Song Jun Seok!

1069
00:53:41,021 --> 00:53:43,023
How could you do this to me, Song Jun Seok?

1070
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:49,329
Don't you know what I've done for you, Song Jun Seok?

1071
00:53:49,362 --> 00:53:50,931
Song Jun Seok, Song Jun Seok!

1072
00:53:55,702 --> 00:53:57,838
- That's... - Again?

1073
00:53:58,371 --> 00:53:59,706
What's wrong with you?

1074
00:54:01,274 --> 00:54:03,777
I'm... I'm sorry, sir.

1075
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:05,812
- Is my acting funny? - No.

1076
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:08,081
I'm your senior. How dare you laugh at me?

1077
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:11,384
Director Kim, I can't shoot today.

1078
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,622
- Sir... - Sir? Sir?

1079
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,291
Are you insane?

1080
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:19,759
Why do you keep laughing?

1081
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:21,962
- I'm sorry. - Be quiet.

1082
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:25,031
If he quits, it's over for you too.

1083
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:26,399
Got that?

1084
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:29,736
Sir?

1085
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:31,238
Sir?

1086
00:54:31,905 --> 00:54:33,306
My goodness.

1087
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,010
Why do I keep laughing? Why?

1088
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,686
Pretending to be sick isn't easy.

1089
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:49,656
Gosh, I feel so stiff.

1090
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:54,060
It's fine as long as Yoon Ah doesn't go near Hyun Joon.

1091
00:54:57,197 --> 00:54:58,298
My legs.

1092
00:54:58,298 --> 00:54:59,599
Take your medicine.

1093
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:00,934
Okay.

1094
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:03,169
- Do they still hurt a lot? - Yes.

1095
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,272
They're getting worse.

1096
00:55:07,073 --> 00:55:10,110
I wonder if I'll be able to walk again.

1097
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,578
This is terrible.

1098
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:14,014
- Take your medicine first. - Okay.

1099
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:15,782
Can you get up?

1100
00:55:15,782 --> 00:55:17,150
I'll do my best.

1101
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:24,124
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1102
00:55:28,595 --> 00:55:30,664
Shouldn't you wash, Dong Gu?

1103
00:55:30,864 --> 00:55:32,399
Of course I want to wash.

1104
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,467
Don't worry.

1105
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:36,770
Come on, you should wash up.

1106
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:39,005
Let's go. I'll help you.

1107
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:43,076
You don't have to do it.

1108
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,578
Move slowly.

1109
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:47,213
Gosh, I really mean it.

1110
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:53,053
Here you go.

1111
00:55:54,387 --> 00:55:56,890
- Thank you, Yoon Ah. - Don't mention it.

1112
00:55:58,058 --> 00:55:59,859
But how will you wash your hair?

1113
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:02,696
It's okay. I'll wash it when I get better.

1114
00:56:03,063 --> 00:56:04,831
You should still wash your hair.

1115
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:07,901
Then I'll wash it for you.

1116
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:09,970
What? Would you really do that for me?

1117
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:12,906
No, it's okay.

1118
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,909
Shall I lie down? What should I do?

1119
00:56:22,082 --> 00:56:25,018
I'm sorry about my legs.

1120
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:28,088
I'm really sorry.

1121
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:29,356
It's okay.

1122
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:31,891
Right there. That's right.

1123
00:56:32,092 --> 00:56:33,360
Are you home, Yoon Ah?

1124
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:36,496
That sounds like Hyun Joon.

1125
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,335
What brings you here?

1126
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:44,537
I was worried about Dong Gu.

1127
00:56:44,537 --> 00:56:48,408
It was going well, but why is he here?

1128
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,110
How are your legs, Dong Gu?

1129
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,779
They're okay.

1130
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:54,414
They got worse than yesterday.

1131
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:55,782
He can't move on his own.

1132
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:57,150
Really?

1133
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,119
That's terrible.

1134
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,889
- What are you looking at? - Hello, Seo Jin.

1135
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:05,892
What? Really?

1136
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:08,828
Okay, I got it.

1137
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:11,431
Is something wrong?

1138
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:15,101
Seo Jin left an important document. She wants me to bring it to work,

1139
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:18,405
but I can't just leave you here. What should I do?

1140
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:19,572
That brat.

1141
00:57:19,572 --> 00:57:21,174
You should go. I'll stay with him.

1142
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:23,476
Can you?

1143
00:57:23,476 --> 00:57:25,645
- Then I'll be right back. - Okay.

1144
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,982
Hey, Yoon Ah.

1145
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:30,817
You can't just leave.

1146
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:32,085
I'll rinse it.

1147
00:57:32,085 --> 00:57:33,953
What? Are you crazy?

1148
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,488
Why would you rinse my hair?

1149
00:57:35,488 --> 00:57:38,725
You still have foam in it. You can't stay like this.

1150
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:40,226
I'm fine.

1151
00:57:40,226 --> 00:57:42,862
Just stay still. I'll rinse it for you.

1152
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:45,165
I'm fine. What are you doing? Don't touch my hair.

1153
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:47,333
Stay still.

1154
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:49,102
Gosh.

1155
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,106
I think you should rinse it again.

1156
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:55,241
It's okay. It's rinsed.

1157
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:57,277
There's more foam left. I'll bring some water.

1158
00:57:57,277 --> 00:58:00,213
I said that I'm okay.

1159
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:02,248
You still have some foam left.

1160
00:58:02,248 --> 00:58:04,718
No, I'm done rinsing.

1161
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:07,654
- You still have foam left. - Come on.

1162
00:58:07,687 --> 00:58:10,256
- I said I'm fine. - Oh, no.

1163
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:14,094
Darn it.

1164
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:16,062
I said that I'm okay.

1165
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:17,530
What have you done?

1166
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,132
I'm sorry.

1167
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:21,568
You're all wet.

1168
00:58:21,568 --> 00:58:23,069
You should get changed.

1169
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:25,171
Where is your room? I'll get you changed.

1170
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:27,674
What? You can't change my clothes.

1171
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,409
Who do you think you are?

1172
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,012
- Shall I let you go? - Yes.

1173
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:34,247
- Okay. - What are you doing?

1174
00:58:35,749 --> 00:58:38,418
I'll help you get changed now.

1175
00:58:39,252 --> 00:58:42,255
I'm fine. I'm completely okay.

1176
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:44,424
Just stay still.

1177
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:47,360
Where shall I start? Let me change your pants.

1178
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:50,630
What's wrong with you? Hey.

1179
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,466
Let me do it. It's because I'm sorry.

1180
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,135
I'll change them myself.

1181
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:56,803
I'll change them.

1182
00:58:56,803 --> 00:58:58,438
How?

1183
00:58:58,605 --> 00:59:00,673
You can't move because your legs hurt.

1184
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:03,643
Were you faking it?

1185
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,813
What did you say? "Faking it"?

1186
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:09,415
Who do you think I am?

1187
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:11,184
So stay still.

1188
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:13,119
- Hey! - Come on.

1189
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:17,190
You're all wet.

1190
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,992
I think we should change your underwear too.

1191
00:59:18,992 --> 00:59:21,127
Gosh, you can't do this to me.

1192
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:23,663
Just stay still. Why are you...

1193
00:59:28,835 --> 00:59:29,936
It's done now.

1194
00:59:31,304 --> 00:59:33,706
Dong Gu, where are your panties?

1195
00:59:34,774 --> 00:59:35,842
Hey!

1196
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:38,311
You can't leave me naked like this.

1197
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,225
Hello, Bacca

1198
00:59:52,425 --> 00:59:54,994
Jun Ki, is it going well?

1199
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:56,095
No.

1200
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:59,332
I laughed again when he was acting, so I was told off again.

1201
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:02,936
If I laugh one more time, I might really get fired. What should I do?

1202
01:00:03,102 --> 01:00:04,270
That's a big problem.

1203
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:07,907
In that case, think of something else whenever you want to laugh.

1204
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:09,242
Think of something sad.

1205
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:10,643
I've tried everything.

1206
01:00:11,044 --> 01:00:13,980
I've even pinched my thighs and bit on my tongue.

1207
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,181
But when he says, "Song Jun Seok",

1208
01:00:15,348 --> 01:00:17,283
everything doesn't work.

1209
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,785
Nothing works.

1210
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:21,221
Really? What should we do?

1211
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:25,258
Then what do you think about trying this?

1212
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:26,893
What?

1213
01:00:29,462 --> 01:00:30,563
Sir.

1214
01:00:30,897 --> 01:00:33,199
I was sorry about what happened before.

1215
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,569
It will never happen again.

1216
01:00:36,603 --> 01:00:37,670
It's fine.

1217
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:41,407
If you laugh one more time,

1218
01:00:41,407 --> 01:00:43,743
I won't let you get away with it. Do you understand?

1219
01:00:43,843 --> 01:00:46,279
Yes, sir.

1220
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,948
Let's begin shooting.

1221
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:51,684
Get ready. Cue.

1222
01:00:52,585 --> 01:00:55,889
Sir, I can't follow your orders.

1223
01:00:56,723 --> 01:00:59,292
I have to get this news out.

1224
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:00,360
What?

1225
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,962
Even if I lose my position as an anchor...

1226
01:01:02,962 --> 01:01:06,566
Even if I die, I'll announce this report.

1227
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,201
- Do you understand? - Song Jun Seok.

1228
01:01:08,201 --> 01:01:11,271
Song Jun Seok, Song Jun Seok, Song Jun Seok!

1229
01:01:11,604 --> 01:01:13,640
How could you do this to me, Song Jun Seok?

1230
01:01:22,448 --> 01:01:23,816
This is driving me crazy.

1231
01:01:24,384 --> 01:01:26,653
It will be the end for me if I laugh this time.

1232
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,488
What should I do?

1233
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:33,159
Wait, should I really try what Seo Jin suggested?

1234
01:01:34,193 --> 01:01:35,862
Whenever you feel like laughing,

1235
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:37,964
think about something that scares you the most.

1236
01:01:38,164 --> 01:01:41,668
Think of something that gives you goosebumps.

1237
01:01:41,968 --> 01:01:44,904
All right. I have nothing to lose.

1238
01:01:45,071 --> 01:01:46,806
Let's try that.

1239
01:01:47,874 --> 01:01:50,743
Don't you know what I've done for you, Song Jun Seok?

1240
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:59,652
You will no longer be alive.

1241
01:01:59,652 --> 01:02:01,287
Song Jun Seok!

1242
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:08,661
You will no longer be alive.

1243
01:02:09,195 --> 01:02:11,030
Song Jun Seok!

1244
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:17,737
You will no longer be alive. You will no longer be alive.

1245
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:19,172
Song Jun Seok!

1246
01:02:19,806 --> 01:02:23,876
You will no longer be alive.

1247
01:02:28,982 --> 01:02:31,918
You won't be able to work here anymore.

1248
01:02:32,018 --> 01:02:33,953
Do you understand, Jun Seok?

1249
01:02:35,188 --> 01:02:36,489
Do as you want.

1250
01:02:37,023 --> 01:02:38,257
But sir,

1251
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:40,360
is it the media's job to cover up issues?

1252
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,963
Is it our job to distort facts and incite people?

1253
01:02:44,497 --> 01:02:47,900
The media cannot distort facts or omit them.

1254
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:49,068
That...

1255
01:02:49,135 --> 01:02:51,537
is the obligation and duty as a reporter.

1256
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:53,039
Do you understand?

1257
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:55,508
Cut! Okay.

1258
01:02:55,608 --> 01:02:58,044
That was great, Jun Ki.

1259
01:02:58,444 --> 01:02:59,512
Thank you.

1260
01:03:00,446 --> 01:03:02,482
- Thank you, sir. - Well done.

1261
01:03:02,682 --> 01:03:05,051
You did so well. Why did you do that earlier?

1262
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:07,887
You're good at acting.

1263
01:03:09,922 --> 01:03:12,759
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1264
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:17,330
I did it. I did it!

1265
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,902
This is so embarrassing.

1266
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:26,439
Why did he have to see that?

1267
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:28,975
Why does something like this...

1268
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:32,345
always happen with him? Why?

1269
01:03:36,783 --> 01:03:38,584
I'm sorry I was late.

1270
01:03:38,584 --> 01:03:40,153
I took the wrong bus.

1271
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:41,654
It's fine.

1272
01:03:42,522 --> 01:03:44,490
What's wrong with Dong Gu?

1273
01:03:44,957 --> 01:03:46,325
Did anything happen?

1274
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:47,693
Well...

1275
01:03:51,497 --> 01:03:53,366
No, nothing happened.

1276
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:54,667
That's a relief.

1277
01:03:54,834 --> 01:03:56,536
You must be tired, Hyun Joon.

1278
01:03:56,536 --> 01:03:58,471
It's fine.

1279
01:03:58,604 --> 01:03:59,872
I'll get going now.

1280
01:03:59,872 --> 01:04:01,507
- Then I'll see you outside. - Okay.

1281
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:02,642
Wait.

1282
01:04:03,476 --> 01:04:06,245
I'll see him out. You should stay here.

1283
01:04:06,779 --> 01:04:10,616
He nursed me today. I should see him out.

1284
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:20,560
Don't touch me.

1285
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:28,534
Wait.

1286
01:04:28,801 --> 01:04:30,570
We need to talk.

1287
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:34,273
What happened today never happened.

1288
01:04:34,707 --> 01:04:38,010
I saw your... You know.

1289
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,646
We'll both get hurt, okay?

1290
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:44,383
All right. Nothing happened.

1291
01:04:44,617 --> 01:04:45,718
Are you satisfied?

1292
01:04:45,718 --> 01:04:47,887
Well, yes.

1293
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:51,524
But did you really come here because you were worried about me?

1294
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:52,625
Yes.

1295
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:55,128
I want you to get better soon.

1296
01:04:55,228 --> 01:04:57,029
- Really? - Yes.

1297
01:04:57,196 --> 01:04:59,499
That way, I'll get to see Yoon Ah more often.

1298
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:02,802
So you came here because of Yoon Ah, not me.

1299
01:05:03,236 --> 01:05:05,671
A man shouldn't act like that.

1300
01:05:05,671 --> 01:05:08,474
Pretending to be ill is not manly either.

1301
01:05:08,608 --> 01:05:10,843
What... What did you say?

1302
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:13,679
"Pretending to be ill"? What are you talking about?

1303
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,349
Are you saying I'm pretending to be ill?

1304
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:17,917
Never mind then.

1305
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:21,787
I hope you get better. Bye.

1306
01:05:23,222 --> 01:05:24,323
I...

1307
01:05:24,457 --> 01:05:27,793
I won't get better. Why should I get better?

1308
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:31,164
Gosh, look at him. He didn't even listen.

1309
01:05:33,499 --> 01:05:35,968
I think he figured it out already.

1310
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:40,206
What? Then did he do that on purpose?

1311
01:05:40,206 --> 01:05:42,742
Gosh, that scum. Seriously.

1312
01:05:43,442 --> 01:05:44,710
My gosh!

1313
01:05:49,048 --> 01:05:51,184
Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

1314
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:54,387
Yoon Ah! Let me take a look. Are you hurt? Are you all right?

1315
01:05:54,387 --> 01:05:57,190
- I'm fine. - Gosh, that... Gosh.

1316
01:05:57,823 --> 01:05:59,592
- Your legs... - What?

1317
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,669
Gosh, my legs.

1318
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:11,337
Gosh.

1319
01:06:11,337 --> 01:06:14,106
You said you couldn't move, but you can even run.

1320
01:06:14,106 --> 01:06:15,775
I thought you were Usain Bolt.

1321
01:06:16,242 --> 01:06:18,411
Were you pretending to be ill?

1322
01:06:18,544 --> 01:06:20,780
I wasn't.

1323
01:06:20,913 --> 01:06:22,415
I...

1324
01:06:22,748 --> 01:06:25,618
I must have had superhuman powers for a quick moment.

1325
01:06:25,618 --> 01:06:26,953
Stop it.

1326
01:06:27,086 --> 01:06:28,955
Stop pretending, and stand up.

1327
01:06:28,955 --> 01:06:31,324
I'm not.

1328
01:06:31,324 --> 01:06:34,627
I'm Kang Dong Gu, the manliest man among men.

1329
01:06:35,194 --> 01:06:37,964
Really? Then use that power...

1330
01:06:37,964 --> 01:06:39,765
to come back home by yourself.

1331
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:42,001
Yoon Ah.

1332
01:06:42,435 --> 01:06:45,371
Yoon Ah, let's go together.

1333
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:47,807
I'm really hurt. Gosh, this is just a misunderstanding.

1334
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:51,310
Yoon Ah, you should at least help me back up the wheelchair.

1335
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,912
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah.

1336
01:06:53,746 --> 01:06:55,081
I'm really in pain.

1337
01:06:56,315 --> 01:06:57,984
It's really cold down here.

1338
01:07:24,577 --> 01:07:27,913
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1339
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:29,415
Dong Gu, do you have time tomorrow?

1340
01:07:29,415 --> 01:07:30,683
When, where, and what time do you want to meet?

1341
01:07:30,683 --> 01:07:32,251
What? I see you're wearing that shirt.

1342
01:07:32,251 --> 01:07:33,352
- Yoon Ah. - Gosh.

1343
01:07:33,886 --> 01:07:35,254
What are you doing here?

1344
01:07:35,254 --> 01:07:37,690
Why do you sit next to Yoon Ah?

1345
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,158
That's the prize?

1346
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:42,194
Can you please participate in a couple event with me?

1347
01:07:42,194 --> 01:07:43,629
Then I'll be off to the CF meeting.

1348
01:07:43,629 --> 01:07:46,932
Your smile is most important in this advertisement.

1349
01:07:47,566 --> 01:07:49,201
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

1350
01:07:49,201 --> 01:07:50,736
- What's wrong? - I'm fine.

1351
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:52,238
Next, your expressions.

1352
01:07:52,238 --> 01:07:53,439
It looks delicious.

1353
01:07:53,439 --> 01:07:54,440
Gosh, it's so good.

1354
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,541
The game is on.

1355
01:07:55,675 --> 01:07:57,410
- Can I borrow your car? - Can you drive?

1356
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,411
Of course.

1357
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:00,513
- Du Shik, what are the brakes? - What?

1358
01:08:00,513 --> 01:08:02,715
Slow down. You're going too fast.

1359
01:08:02,715 --> 01:08:03,883
Step on the brakes. The brakes.

1360
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:05,785
- What is this? - Is this the brake pedal?

1361
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:07,853
Pull the side brakes. What's wrong with this car?

1362
01:08:08,587 --> 01:08:10,790
Du Shik, what should we do?
