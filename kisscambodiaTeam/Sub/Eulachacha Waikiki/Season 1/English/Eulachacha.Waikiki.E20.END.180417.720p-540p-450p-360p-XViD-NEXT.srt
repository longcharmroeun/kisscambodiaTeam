1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,749
(Ms. Han Yoon Ah, Congratulations. You've passed the exam.)

2
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:14,217
(See the details on the website.)

3
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:19,990
Yoon Ah.

4
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,542
I haven't seen you in a while.

5
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:42,212
Hey.

6
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:43,847
Have you been well?

7
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:47,017
What brings you here?

8
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:49,786
I wanted to ask you for forgiveness.

9
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:53,556
I know that I can't be forgiven no matter what.

10
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:57,527
It's unnecessary, so just leave.

11
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:02,332
- Yoon Ah. - It's unnecessary. Just leave.

12
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:07,370
Yoon Ah, what's wrong?

13
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:10,006
Who is he?

14
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:12,642
Who is he? What's wrong?

15
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:38,835
I didn't know.

16
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:41,104
I really didn't know.

17
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:43,440
I'm sorry, Yoon Ah.

18
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,742
I'm really sorry.

19
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:47,243
You don't need to be sorry.

20
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:49,346
Sol is my daughter.

21
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:51,981
She has nothing to do with you.

22
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:56,252
I'll be responsible.

23
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,954
I'll be responsible for everything.

24
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:00,557
Responsible?

25
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,793
What will you be responsible of?

26
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,596
Where were you when I was suffering?

27
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,264
How could you say that now?

28
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,268
You weren't next to me when it was difficult every day.

29
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,604
You never called me.

30
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:20,577
There's someone who held my hand during those times.

31
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:23,513
And now,

32
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:26,416
I love him.

33
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:30,253
- Yoon Ah. - Stop it.

34
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:33,289
I decided to give birth to Sol.

35
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,191
You have nothing to do with my daughter.

36
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:37,827
We broke up.

37
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:40,630
Let's pretend that we don't know each other.

38
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:43,933
Goodbye.

39
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:46,870
Yoon Ah.

40
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,239
Yoon Ah!

41
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:54,377
Let's go, Dong Gu.

42
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:13,029
Seo Jin.

43
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:15,098
What did you mean?

44
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:17,367
Some time to think?

45
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:18,635
Let's reconsider...

46
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:20,904
our relationship.

47
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,839
Reconsider what?

48
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:24,774
What's wrong all of a sudden?

49
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:27,477
Is it because I couldn't keep my promise today?

50
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,246
Is it because of the scandal?

51
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:34,451
What is it? Tell me so I can understand.

52
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:36,419
Everything is difficult.

53
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:39,289
I can't see you often because you're busy.

54
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,458
We can't freely go on dates.

55
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,527
Everything is hard including having to hide that you're my boyfriend.

56
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:53,236
Okay.

57
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:56,439
Then I'll tell the truth to the reporters.

58
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,074
I'll fix everything. It'll be all right.

59
00:03:58,074 --> 00:03:59,142
Don't do that.

60
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:02,345
Your career is finally going well after years of effort.

61
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,514
I don't want to interfere.

62
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:06,216
You don't want this or that.

63
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:09,719
- What do you want me to do? - I don't know either.

64
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:12,856
However, it's difficult.

65
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,457
I'm disappointed.

66
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:16,659
I feel pathetic.

67
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:23,566
I thought I was a strong person.

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,368
I guess I'm not.

69
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:28,872
Jun Ki.

70
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,374
I don't want to look at your face right now.

71
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:33,009
Can you leave?

72
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,479
- Seo Jin. - Leave.

73
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,081
Leave now!

74
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:40,650
Wait, Seo Jin.

75
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:42,886
Seo Jin.

76
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:44,821
Seo Jin.

77
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:08,778
(Because It Hurts)

78
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:14,017
The president became a zombie.

79
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:17,153
He pulled energy from his lower abdomen...

80
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:19,455
and focused it on his fingers.

81
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,391
Finally,

82
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:24,460
the president's super-ultra-energized...

83
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,796
finger jam exploded.

84
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:30,099
The alien gripped its torn eye...

85
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:31,534
and struggled.

86
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,538
Do I like a person like him?

87
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:36,839
Why?

88
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,009
I'm the legendary beauty queen of Huam-dong.

89
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:43,012
He wears sweatshirts and writes stories online.

90
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:44,714
That Bong Du Shik?

91
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:47,350
No, no way.

92
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:48,518
Of course not.

93
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,289
Why are you looking at me?

94
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,727
Why? Do I look handsome the more you look at me?

95
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:02,065
I was kidding.

96
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:03,866
What's with the serious look?

97
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:10,106
You can't kid about certain things. What kind of joke is that?

98
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:13,209
Was it such a terrible joke?

99
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,411
Forget it. Don't talk to me anymore, you pig.

100
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:20,383
You're calling me a pig again. Have you seen such a lean pig?

101
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:23,019
Did I gain weight?

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,255
You're home. How was your date?

103
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,593
What's going on?

104
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:33,763
- Did you argue? - I'll get some rest.

105
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,365
Okay.

106
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,204
What's wrong with her? Did something happen?

107
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:45,942
What?

108
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,311
Sol's dad came to see her?

109
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,515
Why all of a sudden?

110
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,218
I don't know. I can't ask her.

111
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:56,953
What's going on?

112
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:00,223
You're leaving in a week.

113
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:01,524
You must be bothered.

114
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,060
Soo Ah, the standard of happiness differs for everyone.

115
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:12,595
You still have time.

116
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:15,031
Find work that will make you happy...

117
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:16,432
all your life.

118
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,900
I just gave it a try.

119
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,602
What? They look cute.

120
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:22,472
Unconventional style is popular these days.

121
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:23,506
Do you want to try it on?

122
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:29,245
Gosh, why do I keep thinking about Du Shik?

123
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,380
This is driving me crazy.

124
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:37,086
The doctor told me not to drink so much.

125
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:42,525
Whatever.

126
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:01,911
I don't like Du Shik, do I?

127
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:07,450
(Min Bong Soo Du Ah Shik)

128
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,752
Eight.

129
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:13,689
20 percent?

130
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,325
I don't like him that much.

131
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,128
That's a relief.

132
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,566
Wait. Does 20 percent still mean that I like him?

133
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,068
Gosh, it became more complicated.

134
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:28,337
Wait.

135
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:32,441
(Bong Min Du Soo Shik Ah)

136
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:37,380
64 percent?

137
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:41,551
That means Du Shik likes me more.

138
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:46,055
Are you happy? Yes, I am.

139
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:48,224
Are you happy that this is correct?

140
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:51,060
You're crazy, Soo Ah.

141
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,262
You've lost your mind.

142
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,844
Why doesn't she come when it's time to eat?

143
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:09,645
She makes me come up to wake her up.

144
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:14,450
Is this a pigsty or what?

145
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:16,452
She even drank?

146
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:20,256
Soo Ah. Hey.

147
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,959
Hey, wake up.

148
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,160
Why are you sleeping here?

149
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,328
What?

150
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,298
What? What's the matter?

151
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:30,666
Why are you so startled?

152
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:33,336
Hey, why did you drink so much?

153
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:36,639
It's none of your business, you pig.

154
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:40,142
Hey. Why do you keep calling me a pig? It's childish.

155
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:42,912
Yes, I am childish. Do you have a problem?

156
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:45,214
Forget it.

157
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:48,384
Can't you clean up a bit?

158
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:49,685
It's so messy.

159
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:54,156
Whatever. I have an upset stomach. Stop nagging.

160
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,424
Gosh, my stomach.

161
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:57,026
What's all this?

162
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:00,329
Hold on.

163
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,498
(Bong Min Du Soo Shik Ah)

164
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,371
- Du Shik! - Gosh.

165
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,739
Why are you yelling?

166
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:13,576
Give that to me. It's mine, you thief.

167
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:16,312
I'm a thief now?

168
00:11:18,814 --> 00:11:20,283
That was close.

169
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:35,698
It's not here.

170
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,434
Where is it?

171
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,236
Why is it not here?

172
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:47,376
Dong Gu, did you sleep well?

173
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,312
Yes.

174
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:51,213
It's grilled mackerel, your favorite.

175
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:54,383
- Doesn't it look tasty? - Yes.

176
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:56,118
Thank you.

177
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:57,920
Du Shik, why aren't you eating?

178
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,356
I heard so many insults this morning that I'm not even hungry.

179
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,758
Why? Did something happen?

180
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,627
The thing is, Soo Ah...

181
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:10,066
Soo Ah, what are you doing?

182
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,234
It's none of your business. Keep eating, you pig.

183
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:15,137
- See? She insulted me again. - Excuse me.

184
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,979
Hey, what are you doing here?

185
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:26,315
I have something to tell you.

186
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:30,987
What's with you?

187
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,022
I have nothing more to say to you.

188
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,591
What's going on? What's wrong, Yoon Ah?

189
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:37,026
Who is he?

190
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:39,028
Come with me.

191
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:42,865
Hey.

192
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:44,900
Who is he?

193
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,335
Is he...

194
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:52,541
What's with you?

195
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:55,511
I said we should be strangers.

196
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:57,546
There's nothing you can change now.

197
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:59,482
I'm not asking you to take me back.

198
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:01,350
I know I don't have the right to.

199
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:03,586
But...

200
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:06,155
even so,

201
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:09,158
I'm still Sol's dad.

202
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,730
I feel ashamed to say this, but I want to make it up to Sol...

203
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,533
and be forgiven by you.

204
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:19,935
- Can't I do that? - No.

205
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,271
You can't.

206
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:25,141
Let me tell you one more time.

207
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:27,243
Sol is my daughter.

208
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:29,412
She has nothing to do with you.

209
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:32,948
So never show up again.

210
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:38,521
Why is Sol's dad here?

211
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:41,624
I don't know. I wonder if Yoon Ah is okay.

212
00:13:45,628 --> 00:13:47,663
Sorry for the trouble.

213
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,286
Daddy.

214
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,528
Sorry again for the trouble.

215
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,130
Bye.

216
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:23,966
Bye.

217
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:36,112
Did Sol...

218
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:38,714
just call him Daddy?

219
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:40,749
- Did she? - Yes.

220
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,855
She never said it no matter how much Dong Gu tried.

221
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:47,790
That's so interesting.

222
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:50,226
They say blood is thicker than water.

223
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:52,561
That's probably right. Don't you think?

224
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,863
Hey.

225
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:57,066
- I need some rest. - Okay.

226
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:04,807
Hey, how could you be so insensitive?

227
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:06,242
What did I do?

228
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:32,568
- What are you doing? - I'm playing with Sol.

229
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:35,538
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,773
For what?

231
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,643
He'll never come back again.

232
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:42,912
So don't worry.

233
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:44,813
Okay?

234
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,883
I'm not worried at all.

235
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:49,718
Why would I be?

236
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:52,087
Don't worry.

237
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:55,891
That's a relief.

238
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:02,831
I heard you've been waiting since the morning.

239
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,534
What's the matter?

240
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:07,603
Well...

241
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:14,109
Sir, I'd like to deny the rumor about Cindy and me.

242
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,279
What? What are you talking about?

243
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:19,281
I'm in love with someone else.

244
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:22,751
I don't think this is fair...

245
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:24,453
for her.

246
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,923
Jun Ki, you're so romantic.

247
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:31,026
- Don't be such a romantic. - Sorry?

248
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:34,230
Do you think you're in the position to be romantic?

249
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,599
Director, what I'm saying is...

250
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,733
Cut it out.

251
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:42,471
A ton of actors disappear after one work every year.

252
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:43,973
Do you think you're an exception?

253
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:46,342
I'll work hard.

254
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:49,144
- I'll work... - If hard work can make you a star,

255
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:51,380
everyone would be one.

256
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:55,050
Do you know why people fail?

257
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:57,820
They lack luck and opportunities.

258
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,157
You're given the opportunity of a lifetime right now,

259
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:04,393
and you want to throw it away?

260
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,300
Fine. Deny it in front of the reporters if you want.

261
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,636
But as soon as you do that,

262
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,638
your contract will be canceled.

263
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:17,273
Well...

264
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:22,011
You need to stay somewhere else.

265
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:25,614
What? I need to move?

266
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:28,250
There must be a ton of reporters in front of your place right now.

267
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:32,655
This rumor should go on for at least a week.

268
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:42,231
Jun Ki, you can stay here for the time being.

269
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:45,734
The shooting will be postponed for a few days, so don't worry.

270
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,554
(Jun Ki)

271
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:10,659
(Decline)

272
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:16,465
I was going over the scenario yesterday,

273
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:18,801
and I didn't really like the ending.

274
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:20,836
Could we add some kind of a twist?

275
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:23,205
- Twist? - I don't need your opinion.

276
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:25,541
I want to hear Dong Gu's.

277
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,643
Look at him. He's coming up with something again.

278
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:28,777
Be quiet, everyone.

279
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:31,714
Dong Gu, what is it? Are you getting any ideas?

280
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:34,450
(Daddy)

281
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,286
Daddy! Daddy!

282
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,154
"Daddy"?

283
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:42,491
So he managed to assassinate the man,

284
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:43,992
but the man turned out to be his dad?

285
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:46,362
That sounds interesting.

286
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:48,364
The main character is Korean.

287
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,866
- How can his dad be Arab? - Why not?

288
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:53,202
He was adopted as a baby,

289
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,537
and he got lost while playing outside.

290
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:59,241
And he happened to get on a ship to Korea. Right?

291
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,143
What? That's a bit...

292
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:02,244
Be quiet.

293
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:04,913
Dong Gu, you did it again.

294
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,083
I'll retire after this movie. You can be the director.

295
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,518
- I give up. - Sorry?

296
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:12,654
If you guys need any help, ask Dong Gu.

297
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:15,290
He has as much authority as I do from now on.

298
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:18,026
Director Kang, I trust you.

299
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:20,529
Sorry? Okay.

300
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:25,934
I'm a director.

301
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:32,107
We need some additional tickets to Dubai. Is that possible?

302
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:36,445
What? Okay. Please call me back.

303
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:37,946
Okay.

304
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:40,616
Gosh, I'm so busy.

305
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:46,722
That's Sol's favorite.

306
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,126
Come on.

307
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:53,662
I don't have much time.

308
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:56,732
There you go!

309
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:57,833
One more time.

310
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,073
Come out!

311
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:08,410
Do you see this?

312
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:11,113
I'm not going home until I catch you!

313
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:14,049
Sol, I'm home!

314
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:15,150
You're home.

315
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:17,119
Yes.

316
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,520
I came by to pick up something.

317
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,490
- What's all this? - This?

318
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:26,762
Well, you see, Sol's father's secretary came by and left all this.

319
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,670
- Dong Gu. You're home. - Hi.

320
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:39,475
- Dong Gu. About all this... - Sorry, I need to get something.

321
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:40,742
I'm in a hurry.

322
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:54,623
What's she doing?

323
00:20:55,057 --> 00:20:56,658
Is she Gollum or what?

324
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:02,698
Hey. What are you doing? Are you a miner?

325
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,099
Are you going to work in a coal mine?

326
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:06,134
What are you looking for?

327
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:08,470
I told you it's none of your business, you baboon.

328
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:11,373
Baboon?

329
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,976
Have you lost your mind?

330
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,412
I couldn't possibly curse in front of Sol.

331
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,116
Sol. What's this?

332
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:22,651
What is this paper you have?

333
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,087
There seems to be something written here.

334
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:29,825
Don't.

335
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:32,895
- Give it to me. - Why? What is it?

336
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:34,763
Just give it to me. It's none of your business.

337
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:36,331
That just makes me more curious.

338
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:38,534
- Give it to me. Let me see it. - No. Don't read it.

339
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:39,801
Hey. Give it to me.

340
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,037
- That hurts. - Let me see it.

341
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,373
Darn it.

342
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,009
Hey, hey. Wait.

343
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:49,711
Soo Ah. What do you think you're doing? What are you doing?

344
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:51,747
Hey.

345
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:56,852
Are you eating paper? Seriously?

346
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:01,290
Look.

347
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,091
I ate it all up. So what?

348
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:10,966
She's a complete maniac.

349
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,501
She's crazy.

350
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:20,242
That was really close.

351
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,280
But why was that in Sol's hands?

352
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:26,515
How did that happen?

353
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:30,619
It doesn't matter as long as I didn't get caught.

354
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:39,695
My stomach.

355
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:42,364
I don't feel well again.

356
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:57,879
Doctor. What's wrong with her?

357
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:00,582
I think she has stomach cramps.

358
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,118
- What did you eat? - Sorry?

359
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:07,422
Well, I had a few drinks yesterday.

360
00:23:07,422 --> 00:23:08,457
What else?

361
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:10,559
Nothing in particular.

362
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,928
What are you talking about? You ate paper earlier.

363
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:14,997
Paper? What type of paper?

364
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:16,665
- A sketchbook sheet. - What?

365
00:23:16,865 --> 00:23:18,300
Why did you eat that?

366
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,902
- Was it an appetizer? - No. You've got it wrong.

367
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:26,074
Stop asking me questions, and do something about this.

368
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:27,242
All right. All right.

369
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:29,478
We'll do a blood test and an endoscopy.

370
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:30,646
All right.

371
00:23:33,982 --> 00:23:35,217
What's wrong with you these days?

372
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:37,686
I can't understand you.

373
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:45,627
Inside of me

374
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:51,700
There's so much of me

375
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:56,071
Doctor. What's there inside me?

376
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:58,640
You have a small cyst...

377
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,543
- and a mild stomach ulcer. - Is that so?

378
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:06,915
Inside of me

379
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:11,753
There are so many cysts

380
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:14,156
It's nothing serious,

381
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:17,125
so stop singing and give me that now. Please?

382
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,393
There you go.

383
00:24:19,494 --> 00:24:21,930
Finally. Hurry up, and take him to the recovery room.

384
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,964
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

385
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:26,201
Inside of me

386
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:28,203
Bring in the next patient.

387
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:36,078
- Let me put a mouth piece on you. - All right.

388
00:24:37,212 --> 00:24:38,313
Bite it.

389
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:41,316
I'll put in the anesthetic now.

390
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:46,221
Wait. This won't hurt, will it?

391
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:47,923
This is my first time undergoing an endoscopy.

392
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:48,990
Don't worry.

393
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:52,327
Once the anesthetic is in, you'll fall asleep. You won't feel a thing.

394
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,361
Here.

395
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:58,200
Actually, anesthetics don't work quite well for me.

396
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:04,539
It works perfectly fine.

397
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:05,874
All right.

398
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:07,776
Let's begin.

399
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:10,479
Here we go.

400
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:16,752
Let go of this. You have to let go of this.

401
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:21,456
Nothing lasts forever

402
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:25,360
You eventually changed

403
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,095
For no reason

404
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,567
What? Why aren't you singing along?

405
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,136
Again.

406
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,371
For no reason

407
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:41,576
None

408
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:43,712
You have no sincerity

409
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,080
None

410
00:25:45,313 --> 00:25:48,316
Okay. You did a great job.

411
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:52,254
I've never seen a patient act like this from the beginning.

412
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:54,022
Why are all my patients like this today?

413
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:57,058
Please let go of this.

414
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:58,960
I have to complete your checkup.

415
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,296
No. I'm not going to give it to you.

416
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,167
If you bring Du Shik, I'll give it to you.

417
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,301
Du Shik?

418
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:08,970
Du Shik as in when you count numbers?

419
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,005
No.

420
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:13,141
I'm talking about Du Shik.

421
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:18,280
My friend, Du Shik, who's really cute and cool.

422
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:22,984
If you don't bring Du Shik over to me,

423
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:26,555
I'll refuse to open my mouth.

424
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:33,595
Is there a Bong Du Shik here by any chance?

425
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:35,897
Sorry? That's me.

426
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,205
Are you Mr. Bong Du Shik?

427
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:46,675
Yes. That's me. What is it?

428
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:50,378
This patient says she has something to say to you.

429
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:54,983
She insisted she wouldn't cooperate unless we brought you here.

430
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,251
Excuse me?

431
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:01,089
- I apologize. - This happens all the time.

432
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,225
Ms. Min Soo Ah.

433
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:05,727
Mr. Bong Du Shik is here.

434
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:07,028
Go ahead, and tell him.

435
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:12,000
You're right.

436
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:15,737
My friend, Du Shik, is here.

437
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:21,576
What's wrong with you? Stop this.

438
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,914
I have something I want to say to you.

439
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:28,316
What is it? Hurry up, and say it.

440
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:32,387
Du Shik.

441
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:35,290
You see,

442
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,427
I think...

443
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:42,797
I like you.

444
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:44,633
What?

445
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,502
Min Soo Ah...

446
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:51,139
likes Bong Du Shik...

447
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:54,075
a lot.

448
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:58,613
What?

449
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:00,949
What are you saying all of a sudden?

450
00:28:02,317 --> 00:28:04,619
I've never seen someone confess their feelings here.

451
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,889
Love confession during an endoscopy. That's a first.

452
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:18,934
I'm so tired.

453
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:23,204
- Are you feeling better? - Yes.

454
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:25,907
Is the checkup over?

455
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,910
Am I in a serious condition?

456
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,447
No. Other than a slight infection in your stomach, you're fine.

457
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:33,982
That's good to hear.

458
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:40,522
Why are you laughing?

459
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:43,858
Did I fart during the checkup by any chance?

460
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:45,860
No. It's not that.

461
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:49,731
You told your friend that you liked him.

462
00:28:49,731 --> 00:28:51,633
What? I confessed?

463
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:54,402
To whom?

464
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:56,771
- I think his last name was Bong. - Bong?

465
00:28:58,206 --> 00:29:00,875
- Was it Bong Du Shik? - Yes. That was his name.

466
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,914
Then you mean to tell me that I confessed to Bong Du Shik?

467
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:07,716
How did that happen?

468
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:09,484
You refused to cooperate...

469
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:11,419
unless we brought your friend to you.

470
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,321
What?

471
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,490
I can't believe this.

472
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:17,993
I must be crazy. I'm crazy.

473
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:28,203
This is so embarrassing.

474
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:33,375
How will I possibly face him?

475
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:05,040
Hello?

476
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:07,842
Yes. This is he.

477
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:11,112
Excuse me?

478
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:19,287
I'm sorry I called you so suddenly.

479
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:22,657
It's fine. But why did you want to talk to me?

480
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,028
I wanted to thank you...

481
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,831
for taking care of Yoon Ah and Sol.

482
00:30:29,998 --> 00:30:32,901
It's not something you should thank me for.

483
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:36,237
I really wanted to tell you how thankful I am.

484
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:38,573
And...

485
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,943
this...

486
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:44,879
is for you.

487
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:49,517
What? "For me"?

488
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,688
Do you want me to take this money and get lost?

489
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:54,923
Is that it?

490
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:57,325
You've been watching too many dramas.

491
00:30:57,492 --> 00:31:01,062
This is so lame, and nobody does this in dramas anymore.

492
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:03,531
- I... - Are you that rich?

493
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:05,767
Let's see how much you brought.

494
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,770
Gosh. What?

495
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:14,843
(To Dong Gu...)

496
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:18,346
What's this?

497
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:19,781
It's a letter.

498
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:24,152
I couldn't express my gratitude in words.

499
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:28,523
I see.

500
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:31,226
I thought...

501
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:37,432
I'll read the letter at home.

502
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:41,769
And I want to ask you a favor.

503
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,441
I want...

504
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,644
to take care of Yoon Ah and Sol.

505
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:52,747
What?

506
00:31:52,914 --> 00:31:55,483
I still love Yoon Ah.

507
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:57,485
"Love"?

508
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:01,122
Then you shouldn't have left in the first place.

509
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:02,657
You...

510
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:05,293
don't know what Yoon Ah's life has been like.

511
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:08,329
How dare you say you want to take care of her now?

512
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:09,931
I know that I've been a coward.

513
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:13,835
I know that I can never be forgiven.

514
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:16,337
That's why I want to pay my debt...

515
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:20,108
to Yoon Ah and Sol even though I know it's too late.

516
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:25,446
Can you help me, Dong Gu?

517
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:32,420
You really have watched too many dramas.

518
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:36,391
Did you think that I would say,

519
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:38,960
"I see. Sol would prefer her rich father..."

520
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,596
"rather than a useless person like me."

521
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:44,432
"It's sad, but I'll let them go"?

522
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:47,101
Listen to me carefully.

523
00:32:48,002 --> 00:32:49,270
I'll protect...

524
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:52,740
Yoon Ah and Sol no matter what. So...

525
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:56,010
Don't ever contact them again.

526
00:32:57,078 --> 00:32:58,546
I'm not going to give up.

527
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:00,748
Never.

528
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:15,029
Min Soo Ah...

529
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,466
likes Bong Du Shik...

530
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,402
a lot.

531
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:23,404
That doesn't make sense.

532
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:26,774
Soo Ah likes me?

533
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,677
Oh, my.

534
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:31,412
Hello.

535
00:33:32,313 --> 00:33:35,149
Du Shik, let's grab a drink.

536
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:36,784
"A drink"?

537
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,053
- Why do you want to drink suddenly? - Just because.

538
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:41,823
I suddenly feel like having a drink.

539
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:46,060
Really? All right.

540
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:48,029
I feel like it too.

541
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:53,735
Hello, Jun Ki.

542
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,372
What? What do you mean?

543
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:02,343
Hello. Come in.

544
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:13,988
What is this place? Why are you here?

545
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:15,790
It just happened.

546
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:18,660
Why did you bring so many things?

547
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:22,030
These are drinks.

548
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,065
He wanted to drink.

549
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:26,567
Really? That's great.

550
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:28,369
I really wanted to drink too.

551
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,004
You too?

552
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:33,541
Then should we drink until the end today?

553
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,543
Should we?

554
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,212
It's been a while. Let's go!

555
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:40,648
Let's drink until we lost ourselves.

556
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:42,250
Let's go!

557
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,519
Let's drink until we go crazy.

558
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:46,654
You should do it too.

559
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,390
No, that's so childish.

560
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,591
Let's go!

561
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,794
Let's drink!

562
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:55,430
- Let's go! - Let's go!

563
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,005
What's wrong with you two?

564
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:05,440
Is something wrong?

565
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:09,177
It's been a while since just us girl have gotten together.

566
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,212
Do you want to have a drink?

567
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,014
Should we?

568
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:16,417
I'd love to, but I don't feel so good.

569
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:19,687
I'll take care of Sol. You two should drink.

570
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:21,289
Really?

571
00:35:21,923 --> 00:35:24,959
Yoon Ah, let's go!

572
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,294
Let's drink!

573
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:28,696
Okay. Let's go!

574
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:31,232
- Let's go, Sol! - Let's go!

575
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:35,536
What?

576
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:38,473
Seo Jin broke up with you?

577
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:41,075
She says it's difficult to go out with me.

578
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,879
I see why Seo Jin said that,

579
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,982
and that's why I wanted to make things right.

580
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:51,586
But I hesitated.

581
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:56,057
At first, I was thankful for how far I've gotten.

582
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:58,760
But I keep getting greedy.

583
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,029
- So are you breaking up with her? - What?

584
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,766
When that happens,

585
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:06,868
you will...

586
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:10,304
no longer be alive.

587
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,606
No!

588
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,076
I won't break up with her.

589
00:36:15,176 --> 00:36:16,210
Don't worry.

590
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,179
Of course.

591
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:20,081
If not,

592
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:22,383
you and Seo Jin...

593
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,353
- will no longer... - Will no longer...

594
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:29,090
- be alive. - be alive.

595
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:33,795
Here.

596
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:35,363
- Cheers. - Cheers.

597
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,465
- Cheers. - Cheers.

598
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:46,107
It's been a while since we got together.

599
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:49,510
I know. There aren't any guests,

600
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,778
and Sol is asleep.

601
00:36:51,245 --> 00:36:52,346
It's good.

602
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,382
We'll go bankrupt if we stay like this.

603
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:57,952
But it's nice and fun to be here...

604
00:36:57,952 --> 00:36:59,554
by ourselves.

605
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:02,924
- But Seo Jin, - Yes?

606
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:05,193
did something happen between you and Jun Ki?

607
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,095
Did you fight?

608
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,933
It's been a little difficult recently.

609
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,069
- What is? - Everything.

610
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,872
I don't think he likes me...

611
00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:20,775
as much as I like him.

612
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,978
I feel like I was in love with him by myself.

613
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:28,516
Why? To me, it seems like Jun Ki likes you more.

614
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,218
Yes.

615
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:31,919
Well,

616
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:34,755
but why don't I know?

617
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:39,494
I don't know. I really don't know.

618
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:45,032
Drink up.

619
00:37:57,111 --> 00:37:59,614
Why are you sighing?

620
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:01,015
Just.

621
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:03,751
I'm a little nervous.

622
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:05,553
Why?

623
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:09,056
Are you nervous now that Sol's dad has appeared?

624
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,092
Are you afraid that Yoon Ah will go to him?

625
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:12,860
- Gosh. - Hey.

626
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:18,199
It's not like that.

627
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:22,870
But he's Sol's real dad.

628
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:24,772
And he's capable.

629
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:29,410
And he leaves Korea in a few days.

630
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:31,946
So I'm a little anxious.

631
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,048
Gosh, you don't need to feel anxious.

632
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:36,050
A few days ago,

633
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:39,287
Sol called him "dad".

634
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:43,891
I felt as if my heart...

635
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,626
had dropped.

636
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:49,864
So I keep feeling anxious.

637
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:55,136
I feel bad that I have to leave them for a month for the movie.

638
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:57,972
You should propose to her then.

639
00:38:58,406 --> 00:38:59,507
"Propose"?

640
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,279
I'm not capable enough for that.

641
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,322
Yoon Ah.

642
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:18,392
Can I ask you something?

643
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:20,795
What?

644
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:25,066
Have you ever regretted going out...

645
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:26,601
with my brother?

646
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:30,504
No.

647
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,207
I've never regretted.

648
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:34,775
Really?

649
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:39,080
No. Dong Gu...

650
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:43,250
isn't talented, he is small-minded,

651
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,852
and he gets angry easily.

652
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:47,154
So he seems like a child,

653
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:52,293
but he loves me more than anyone else in the world.

654
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,063
I can see that from his eyes.

655
00:39:57,698 --> 00:40:00,568
I can see how he cares for me...

656
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:01,902
and loves me.

657
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:06,040
That's enough for me.

658
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:11,112
Gosh, that's making me cringe. I feel like I'm getting sick again.

659
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:16,183
Are you saying that you can tell by looking in his eyes?

660
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,451
Yes.

661
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:20,287
I still don't understand.

662
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:24,058
Love is so difficult.

663
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:29,063
Love is always difficult.

664
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:33,367
I want to give up everything these days.

665
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:34,402
Why?

666
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:37,238
Do you have a crush on someone?

667
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:41,042
- Who is it? - Really?

668
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:43,244
No, don't worry about it.

669
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:53,654
By the way,

670
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:56,257
do you like playing hide-and-seek?

671
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,495
- Hide-and-seek? - Yes.

672
00:41:01,495 --> 00:41:04,632
I love hide-and-seek very much.

673
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:06,434
Do you want to play it?

674
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:10,237
Since Soo Ah didn't drink,

675
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:12,006
you be "it".

676
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:14,742
I'm hiding.

677
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,545
What?

678
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:19,447
What's wrong with Yoon Ah?

679
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:22,183
Do we have to play hide-and-seek?

680
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:24,985
Hey, Seo Jin.

681
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,387
Where are you going?

682
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:28,789
You're "it".

683
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,424
I should go and hide.

684
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:32,760
Hey, wait.

685
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:37,264
Look for us after a count of 10, okay?

686
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:40,401
Goodness.

687
00:41:41,035 --> 00:41:42,269
Soo Ah.

688
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:44,505
I'm hiding.

689
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:47,975
I'm definitely not hiding in the laundry room.

690
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:50,778
Never come here.

691
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:53,581
What's wrong with everyone?

692
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,350
Do I really have to look for them?

693
00:41:57,752 --> 00:41:59,253
This is insane.

694
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,730
Both you and me,

695
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:13,434
life is so difficult.

696
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:15,436
Don't you think?

697
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:18,405
I know.

698
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:24,378
Why are you laughing?

699
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:26,313
It's funny.

700
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:29,650
Both of you seem superficial.

701
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:32,620
When did you become so superficial?

702
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,823
That's silly and cowardly.

703
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:38,526
- Why? - Isn't it?

704
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:39,560
Hey.

705
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,596
Since when did we care about competence?

706
00:42:42,596 --> 00:42:46,100
You're worried that he's rich and competent.

707
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:50,437
What does competence have to do with love?

708
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:52,940
You're the same, Jun Ki.

709
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:57,178
You're not Kim Soo Hyun or Gong Yoo.

710
00:42:57,344 --> 00:43:00,014
You have nothing to lose, but you're such a coward.

711
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:02,883
You refused help so that you can succeed on your own,

712
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,852
but it was a complete lie.

713
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,455
Gosh, am I wrong?

714
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,426
Is it normal to live like this?

715
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:16,363
It makes me a little sad.

716
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:19,066
I didn't think that we'd change.

717
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,336
We can be...

718
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,305
a little nerdy.

719
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:27,741
I still thought our lives were amazing.

720
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,310
Right.

721
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:33,747
Since when did I become such a coward?

722
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:36,350
Being a coward isn't as bad.

723
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:41,622
I'm the least accomplished person in the world.

724
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:44,258
That's right.

725
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:47,962
I almost forgot.

726
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,097
Shall I tell you shocking news?

727
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:53,834
Apparently, Soo Ah...

728
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,904
Soo Ah likes me.

729
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:00,241
What?

730
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,676
Soo Ah likes you?

731
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:04,111
Aren't you surprised?

732
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:06,080
I was really surprised too.

733
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:09,450
Come on, that can't be right.

734
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,686
He's right. That's impossible.

735
00:44:12,686 --> 00:44:13,754
Wait.

736
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:16,557
Why is it Impossible?

737
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:19,894
Soo Ah is a great person.

738
00:44:19,894 --> 00:44:20,928
Gosh.

739
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:22,763
She's cool and pretty.

740
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:23,831
- Right? - Goodness.

741
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:26,333
She's innocent too.

742
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:31,538
You're dating Dong Gu's little sister.

743
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:33,941
Hey, you punk.

744
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,910
That's still wrong.

745
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,712
You punk, that's wrong.

746
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:40,848
That's wrong, you punk.

747
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:42,116
You jerk.

748
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:44,385
- That's not what I mean. - Come here.

749
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,669
- Is it a mustache? - It's a lucky charm.

750
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,673
Even if I'm not with you, take a look at it.

751
00:45:05,673 --> 00:45:08,542
Think that I'm always beside you, okay?

752
00:45:11,645 --> 00:45:13,380
You know that I'm your number one fan, right?

753
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,317
Don't forget that I'm always cheering for you.

754
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:19,153
You can do it, Jun Ki.

755
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:31,832
To you,

756
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,467
aren't I a woman?

757
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,769
To me, you're a man.

758
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,938
I think I like you.

759
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:41,508
Let's start our relationship as a man and a woman.

760
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,310
Jun Ki.

761
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:50,818
Let's go for it.

762
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:53,887
Your career is finally going well after years of effort.

763
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,590
I don't want to interfere.

764
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:09,169
Where are you going?

765
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:12,539
I'm going to see my fan.

766
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:13,974
What do you mean?

767
00:46:13,974 --> 00:46:15,442
What about your meeting with the president?

768
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:18,245
It doesn't matter. He can cancel the contract if he wants.

769
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:20,481
What's wrong all of a sudden?

770
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,352
I'll live like I did before.

771
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:27,421
Without plans or being matured.

772
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:30,824
I won't be a coward.

773
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,329
Jun Ki, Jun Ki.

774
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:45,672
Gosh, that startled me. What was that noise?

775
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:48,609
What's this smell?

776
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:50,844
Who farted? Who?

777
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,883
What? No one is here.

778
00:46:58,652 --> 00:46:59,787
Did I fart?

779
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:02,623
It stinks.

780
00:47:07,795 --> 00:47:09,897
I played hide-and-seek all night.

781
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,132
My whole body hurts.

782
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:14,768
My head hurts.

783
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,907
Gosh, my head hurts so much.

784
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:21,442
My stomach hurts too.

785
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,278
What?

786
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,613
Why is she sleeping here?

787
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:31,418
It's awkward.

788
00:47:31,752 --> 00:47:33,787
I should just go to sleep in my room.

789
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:44,098
That must hurt a lot.

790
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:46,200
She must be sleeping deeply.

791
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:53,507
Where is it?

792
00:47:57,878 --> 00:47:59,880
Right, there it is.

793
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:06,253
I hope that she moves a little more.

794
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:12,593
Gosh, that hurt.

795
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,129
Are you okay, Soo Ah?

796
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:18,298
Yes, I'm fine.

797
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:20,534
When did you get here?

798
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:23,137
I just got here.

799
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,372
I see.

800
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,843
I was sleeping so deeply.

801
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:31,945
I had no idea that you were here.

802
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:34,648
I thought so.

803
00:48:36,517 --> 00:48:38,418
Aren't you picking up the phone?

804
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:41,588
I should. I will.

805
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:47,794
Hello? Yes.

806
00:48:48,562 --> 00:48:50,464
What? Now?

807
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:53,734
Okay, I'll be there.

808
00:48:58,138 --> 00:48:59,139
Soo Ah.

809
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:01,675
Could you help me?

810
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:17,724
Soo Ah, what brings you here?

811
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:18,825
Me?

812
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:21,328
I was driving, and I saw you.

813
00:49:21,762 --> 00:49:23,463
If you're going to an interview, let me give you a ride.

814
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,200
I'm okay. I can take the subway.

815
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,802
Just get in. Hurry.

816
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,306
- I'm really okay. - Get in.

817
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:47,154
Du Shik, you're here too.

818
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:50,090
Yes. Seo Jin, take this.

819
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:53,994
- I don't want it. - I want it.

820
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,195
Seo Jin, please take it.

821
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:58,131
The door on this side doesn't open, and the window is broken.

822
00:49:58,131 --> 00:49:59,700
Just take it.

823
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,134
The window opens a little bit.

824
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,936
Yes. It tastes very good.

825
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,072
Gosh.

826
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:08,775
Give it to me.

827
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:12,613
- What are you doing? - Close the widow.

828
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:17,284
I'm stuck again.

829
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:18,986
I knew it.

830
00:50:18,986 --> 00:50:20,887
- Success. - Okay.

831
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:24,591
What are you talking about? Success?

832
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:26,627
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

833
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:27,694
Okay.

834
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:33,600
What are you doing now? Where are we going?

835
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:35,302
Jun Ki asked us to kidnap you.

836
00:50:35,302 --> 00:50:36,737
So stay quiet.

837
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:39,072
What? I can't believe him.

838
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:41,375
- I'm getting out. - Hey, stay still.

839
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,310
- Stop the car! - Hey!

840
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,544
Leave Soo Ah alone.

841
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:46,446
- It's dangerous. - Du Shik, do something!

842
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:47,614
It hurts!

843
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:49,316
- Fix the window! - Stay still!

844
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,429
Hey.

845
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,065
What are you doing?

846
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:07,301
Hey.

847
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:14,374
Yoon Ah.

848
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:16,677
What are you doing here?

849
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:18,745
I want to return some things.

850
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:25,285
- Yoon Ah, that's... - I know how you feel.

851
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:26,920
I also know...

852
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:29,756
you're sincerely sorry.

853
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:34,027
But no matter what you do,

854
00:51:34,828 --> 00:51:36,496
I won't change my mind.

855
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:39,166
I really love Dong Gu.

856
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:43,670
I'd been suffering a lot,

857
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,074
but he helped me move on.

858
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:51,144
I don't even blame you anymore. I mean it.

859
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:53,780
Since Sol and I...

860
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:56,216
met Dong Gu...

861
00:51:58,018 --> 00:52:01,788
I mean, since we met the family,

862
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:05,592
we've been really happy.

863
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:08,895
So...

864
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:11,965
let's just keep the good memories.

865
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:14,334
If you keep doing this,

866
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:18,205
even our good memories will be ruined too.

867
00:52:21,408 --> 00:52:23,009
Wouldn't that be too sad?

868
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:27,314
I'll get going now.

869
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:35,689
Call me whenever you miss Sol.

870
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:51,204
Make sure we've packed everything.

871
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:54,341
I want everything ready when we're in Dubai, okay?

872
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,375
- Okay. - Okay.

873
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:58,845
Dong Gu, I'd like to see our schedule.

874
00:52:58,845 --> 00:52:59,946
- Okay. - Bring it to me.

875
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,819
- Here you go. - Thank you.

876
00:53:26,473 --> 00:53:29,576
What kind of parent leaves this tiny baby alone?

877
00:53:29,576 --> 00:53:32,145
Sorry for the trouble. We'll get going.

878
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:39,986
Candy never cries even when she is lonely or sad

879
00:53:39,986 --> 00:53:41,221
Neither does Dong Gu

880
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,323
- What's this? - Let's celebrate Sol's 100th day.

881
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:44,958
Thank you, everyone.

882
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:20,427
I like you.

883
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,195
I really like you, Yoon Ah.

884
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:23,864
I really like you, Dong Gu.

885
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:33,740
Why would I break up with you?

886
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,108
My heart races...

887
00:54:35,842 --> 00:54:37,477
whenever I'm with you.

888
00:54:52,926 --> 00:54:56,096
Director, there's something I want to tell you.

889
00:54:57,364 --> 00:55:03,803
(Lee Jun Ki's Emergency Press Conference)

890
00:55:05,972 --> 00:55:08,909
Gosh, what is this? Why isn't he here yet?

891
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:10,977
Seriously. What's going on?

892
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:12,646
What is this place?

893
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:17,817
Who are these people?

894
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:29,296
- He's here. - He's here.

895
00:55:32,098 --> 00:55:33,400
He's here.

896
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,386
Hello. I'm actor Lee Jun Ki.

897
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,188
Thank you all...

898
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:58,224
for coming on such short notice.

899
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,996
I'd like to tell you all the truth...

900
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,799
about the romance rumor between Cindy and myself.

901
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:11,304
(Breaking news)

902
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:14,341
- Cindy and I... - What's this?

903
00:56:14,674 --> 00:56:15,775
"Cindy is getting married."

904
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:18,078
"She was pregnant for three months"?

905
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:20,547
Cindy is getting married to actor Lee Min Seok.

906
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,115
She's pregnant.

907
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:25,452
Gosh, I knew it.

908
00:56:25,452 --> 00:56:29,155
Why would she go out with a new actor like Jun Ki?

909
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:30,557
Let's go.

910
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:36,396
- Wait. - Gosh.

911
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,498
Cindy and I...

912
00:56:38,665 --> 00:56:40,433
Are you going to take them all?

913
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:42,202
Excuse me!

914
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:44,437
Wait! Where are you going?

915
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:45,639
I...

916
00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:53,446
Everyone's left.

917
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,448
What's this? Where is everyone going?

918
00:56:55,515 --> 00:56:57,484
Cindy has announced her wedding plans.

919
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:59,185
Why would they want to stay here?

920
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:03,323
You were being so pretentious. This is embarrassing.

921
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,327
I know. You said we had to get Seo Jin here by all means.

922
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:09,295
Is this what you wanted to show her?

923
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:10,964
It's so embarrassing.

924
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:14,434
What are you all doing right now?

925
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:17,971
- I'm leaving. - Wait.

926
00:57:17,971 --> 00:57:21,274
Seo Jin. Don't leave like this.

927
00:57:21,274 --> 00:57:22,342
Let go of me.

928
00:57:22,842 --> 00:57:25,045
I was going to tell all the reporters...

929
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:26,546
that you're my girlfriend...

930
00:57:26,546 --> 00:57:28,615
and that nothing is going on between Cindy and me.

931
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:31,685
Are you stupid? Did I ask you to do that?

932
00:57:32,952 --> 00:57:35,789
It's not what you want? Then what do you want?

933
00:57:37,824 --> 00:57:39,659
You're so stupid.

934
00:57:39,726 --> 00:57:42,095
- Forget it. I'm leaving. - Seo Jin.

935
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:45,465
I'm sorry.

936
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:48,968
I've been a coward.

937
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:52,338
But I've realized...

938
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:55,508
what's the most important to me.

939
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,144
It's you.

940
00:58:00,513 --> 00:58:01,614
Are you sure?

941
00:58:03,016 --> 00:58:04,084
Seo Jin.

942
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:06,553
I love you.

943
00:58:07,854 --> 00:58:08,988
I really do.

944
00:58:16,896 --> 00:58:18,465
I can finally see it a little.

945
00:58:19,866 --> 00:58:21,868
- What do you mean? - People say...

946
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:23,903
you can see it in their eyes...

947
00:58:23,937 --> 00:58:26,473
about how much someone cares about you.

948
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:28,675
And...

949
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:33,480
I'm starting to see it a little.

950
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:36,015
Really?

951
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:39,586
But just a little?

952
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,821
That's not possible.

953
00:58:41,988 --> 00:58:43,690
Take a close look.

954
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,825
I'm sure you'll see a lot. Take a look.

955
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:47,193
That's gross. Stop it.

956
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:50,130
Just look. Look how much I care about you.

957
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,197
Look.

958
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:53,299
Are you joking around again?

959
00:59:11,684 --> 00:59:12,819
They look great together.

960
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:14,954
Yes, indeed.

961
00:59:15,155 --> 00:59:18,725
Why do they fight so often if they like each other so much?

962
00:59:19,926 --> 00:59:22,695
Then shall we really go to the restaurant today?

963
00:59:22,929 --> 00:59:23,963
All right.

964
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:25,398
Let's go. I'm buying.

965
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,604
Gosh, I'm hungry.

966
00:59:32,172 --> 00:59:34,808
Soo Ah, aren't you hungry?

967
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:37,110
I am. A little.

968
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,713
Really? In that case, do you want to go somewhere nice...

969
00:59:41,014 --> 00:59:42,148
and eat?

970
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:47,420
Just the two of us?

971
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:48,488
Why?

972
00:59:48,955 --> 00:59:52,625
Is there a reason why friends can't have a meal together?

973
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:56,196
Right.

974
00:59:58,097 --> 01:00:01,968
But which restaurant do you mean by somewhere nice?

975
01:00:02,535 --> 01:00:05,238
Well, let's go outside and find one.

976
01:00:08,174 --> 01:00:09,375
Let's go.

977
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:35,068
Why isn't anyone home? It's strange.

978
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:45,245
Hello, this is Waikiki Guesthouse.

979
01:00:45,778 --> 01:00:46,779
Yes.

980
01:00:48,214 --> 01:00:50,617
What? Dong Gu?

981
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:53,553
Yes, all right. Okay.

982
01:00:57,857 --> 01:00:59,826
(Dong Gu)

983
01:01:12,272 --> 01:01:14,841
Dong Gu, what's this?

984
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:30,790
What are you doing?

985
01:01:32,158 --> 01:01:33,226
Yoon Ah.

986
01:01:35,895 --> 01:01:36,996
Yoon Ah,

987
01:01:37,497 --> 01:01:39,032
would you marry me?

988
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:42,902
I'll make you and Sol happy forever.

989
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:46,639
Marry me, Yoon Ah.

990
01:01:54,113 --> 01:01:55,348
I don't want to.

991
01:01:56,783 --> 01:01:57,917
What?

992
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:00,353
Why?

993
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:04,123
Was I being too rude? Then I'll do it again.

994
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,325
Yoon Ah,

995
01:02:06,225 --> 01:02:07,493
would you marry me, please?

996
01:02:09,329 --> 01:02:10,630
No.

997
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,905
Why?

998
01:02:19,138 --> 01:02:20,873
I'll tell you afterwards.

999
01:02:21,641 --> 01:02:23,743
Dong Gu, what happened to your job?

1000
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,812
The director just called.

1001
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:32,218
I decided not to go to Dubai.

1002
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:34,854
I couldn't leave without...

1003
01:02:34,854 --> 01:02:36,622
you and Sol.

1004
01:02:36,856 --> 01:02:37,957
Why not?

1005
01:02:38,558 --> 01:02:40,426
Is it because of her dad?

1006
01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:44,197
No, it's not that.

1007
01:02:46,466 --> 01:02:49,335
Gosh, you require so much effort.

1008
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:51,304
What?

1009
01:02:52,705 --> 01:02:54,007
Kang Dong Gu.

1010
01:02:56,743 --> 01:02:58,111
Are you really that anxious?

1011
01:02:59,012 --> 01:03:00,613
Why are you so anxious?

1012
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:04,217
I'm not. Why are you?

1013
01:03:04,217 --> 01:03:06,519
Gosh, you are a coward.

1014
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:08,921
I'm not.

1015
01:03:09,455 --> 01:03:10,723
Did you think...

1016
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:13,092
I'd be moved if you do this?

1017
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,729
You're going to give up the job that you wanted to do all your life?

1018
01:03:16,996 --> 01:03:19,298
For me?

1019
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:21,501
Can't you trust me?

1020
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:22,502
I...

1021
01:03:23,202 --> 01:03:24,504
It's not like that.

1022
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:30,009
Dong Gu.

1023
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:32,445
Don't worry.

1024
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:34,380
Just go.

1025
01:03:35,915 --> 01:03:37,817
I'll always be here.

1026
01:03:39,252 --> 01:03:40,586
I'll be...

1027
01:03:41,554 --> 01:03:43,556
next to you forever.

1028
01:03:53,232 --> 01:03:54,367
Forever?

1029
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:40,413
I'm going.

1030
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:41,647
- Bye. - Bye.

1031
01:04:41,647 --> 01:04:42,648
Bye.

1032
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:47,286
Don't you fight and talk about breaking up when I'm not here.

1033
01:04:47,286 --> 01:04:48,588
All right.

1034
01:04:48,821 --> 01:04:50,323
You should take care of my sister.

1035
01:04:50,323 --> 01:04:52,091
You know what happens if you don't, right?

1036
01:04:52,091 --> 01:04:53,659
I know. I know.

1037
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,763
"You will no longer be alive."

1038
01:04:57,763 --> 01:04:59,398
I'd treat her like a princess...

1039
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:02,034
if that means I don't have to listen to you say that.

1040
01:05:02,502 --> 01:05:04,170
Okay. That's good.

1041
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,771
Soo Ah, good luck with your business.

1042
01:05:06,172 --> 01:05:08,574
And stop scolding Du Shik, okay?

1043
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:10,743
I never did.

1044
01:05:10,743 --> 01:05:12,245
I don't do that nowadays.

1045
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:14,113
- Why not? - What?

1046
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,350
Why aren't you scolding him? I'm really curious.

1047
01:05:18,584 --> 01:05:19,752
What?

1048
01:05:19,919 --> 01:05:22,155
Be quiet. Go. Go to Dubai.

1049
01:05:23,022 --> 01:05:25,291
Du Shik, you too. Quit dating.

1050
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,360
Get some scenarios done, okay?

1051
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,494
I don't date.

1052
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:29,929
I didn't.

1053
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:32,598
Anyway, finish the writing before I come back.

1054
01:05:32,598 --> 01:05:34,267
I'll check regularly.

1055
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:36,936
All right. Stop preaching.

1056
01:05:38,437 --> 01:05:40,840
Yoon Ah, I'm going now.

1057
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,043
All right. Take care, Dong Gu.

1058
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:45,044
All right.

1059
01:05:45,645 --> 01:05:48,948
Don't forget to eat and sleep well even when I'm not here.

1060
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:52,084
Make sure you digest everything and go to bathrooms regularly.

1061
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:53,886
And don't even look at other men.

1062
01:05:53,886 --> 01:05:56,222
Gosh, okay. Okay.

1063
01:05:56,222 --> 01:05:57,423
Stop talking, and go.

1064
01:05:57,423 --> 01:06:00,326
All right. But I need to say goodbye to Sol.

1065
01:06:02,128 --> 01:06:03,362
Sol.

1066
01:06:03,663 --> 01:06:05,731
Don't forget my face.

1067
01:06:05,731 --> 01:06:08,234
Don't be sick. Be healthy.

1068
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:11,003
I'll be back soon, okay?

1069
01:06:12,171 --> 01:06:14,740
- I'm really going now. - Okay.

1070
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,143
Sol, bye.

1071
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:21,881
Dad.

1072
01:06:24,684 --> 01:06:25,885
What?

1073
01:06:30,256 --> 01:06:31,357
Sol.

1074
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:33,859
What did you just say?

1075
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:36,028
Dad.

1076
01:06:38,698 --> 01:06:40,833
Did you hear that? Did you?

1077
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,970
Did you hear her calling me "dad"?

1078
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:46,539
- Yes. - We did. Are you happy now?

1079
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:47,773
Of course.

1080
01:06:47,773 --> 01:06:49,542
Sol, can you say that one more time?

1081
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:51,911
Say "dad". "Dad".

1082
01:06:52,078 --> 01:06:55,748
Gosh, why are you hiding? You're not easy, are you?

1083
01:06:56,015 --> 01:06:58,918
- One more time. Just one more time. - Gosh.

1084
01:06:58,918 --> 01:07:01,887
Stop it, Dong Gu. You'll be late.

1085
01:07:01,921 --> 01:07:04,790
I don't want to leave now that Sol is calling me dad.

1086
01:07:05,191 --> 01:07:07,493
Yoon Ah, should I just stay?

1087
01:07:07,827 --> 01:07:10,596
You're starting again. Go.

1088
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:11,864
All right.

1089
01:07:15,134 --> 01:07:16,335
I'm really going.

1090
01:07:16,335 --> 01:07:17,336
- Okay. - Okay.

1091
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:19,872
Sol.

1092
01:07:22,842 --> 01:07:24,010
Dad's leaving now.

1093
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:31,150
- Bye. - Bye.

1094
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,686
- Bye. - Take care.

1095
01:07:39,058 --> 01:07:41,927
(2 months later)

1096
01:07:43,763 --> 01:07:44,764
Who are you?

1097
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:47,066
I know you're there.

1098
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,969
Do you want to come out, or should I go to you?

1099
01:07:50,536 --> 01:07:52,038
Come out now, you scum.

1100
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:05,484
I'm surprised you found me.

1101
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,588
You're quick-witted, probably because you're the president.

1102
01:08:10,489 --> 01:08:11,524
Shut it!

1103
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:14,360
Set our people free, you alien.

1104
01:08:14,927 --> 01:08:18,664
I'm surprised to see a president who worries about his people.

1105
01:08:19,031 --> 01:08:20,299
However, it's too late.

1106
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:23,669
We've taken over your people and land already.

1107
01:08:24,737 --> 01:08:27,306
Don't you dare harm my people.

1108
01:08:28,174 --> 01:08:29,342
If you do,

1109
01:08:35,314 --> 01:08:38,684
this finger jab will teach you a lesson.

1110
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:39,919
That's absurd.

1111
01:08:45,691 --> 01:08:47,793
Cut. That's no good.

1112
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:50,029
("President is Bruce Lee")

1113
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:51,097
You fool.

1114
01:08:51,897 --> 01:08:54,100
Why did you have to cough at that moment?

1115
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,569
It's suffocating. Why are you making me do this anyway?

1116
01:08:56,569 --> 01:08:58,170
I'm the writer.

1117
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,972
We have a low budget. I have no choice.

1118
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,641
Can't a writer do this much for his own movie?

1119
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:05,578
Dong Gu. I made time to play this main role for you.

1120
01:09:05,745 --> 01:09:07,046
What am I doing here?

1121
01:09:07,346 --> 01:09:09,915
I'm the famous Song Jun Seok of "Newsroom".

1122
01:09:09,915 --> 01:09:12,351
How much longer are you going to mention that?

1123
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:15,321
You did that one drama and been bumming around since.

1124
01:09:15,321 --> 01:09:16,422
What did you just say?

1125
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:19,759
Didn't I tell you I'm selecting my next piece very carefully?

1126
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,028
I'm doing this without a guarantee fee. You should be grateful.

1127
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:26,265
If we shoot this, will this movie actually be released?

1128
01:09:26,265 --> 01:09:28,167
Why are there more actors than staff members?

1129
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:31,437
A great movie doesn't depend on the number of staff members.

1130
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:34,039
At least we have a great director.

1131
01:09:34,206 --> 01:09:37,777
- Whom are you trying to kid? - I agree. I can't believe you.

1132
01:09:37,777 --> 01:09:38,911
You're more unbelievable!

1133
01:09:38,911 --> 01:09:41,013
How could you write such a terrible scenario?

1134
01:09:41,013 --> 01:09:42,281
- What do you mean? - What kind of director are you?

1135
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:44,316
- I'm a writer. I wrote this. - You two are no different.

1136
01:09:44,316 --> 01:09:46,719
- All you did was bum around. - Be quiet!

1137
01:09:49,388 --> 01:09:52,324
You asked me to write an article. But are you fighting again?

1138
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:54,560
Shall I write an article about you three fighting?

1139
01:09:55,694 --> 01:09:57,696
You fools.

1140
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:02,168
This movie is bound to fail.

1141
01:10:02,168 --> 01:10:03,736
Let's just stop here.

1142
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:07,006
What are you talking about? This movie's going to be a big hit.

1143
01:10:07,006 --> 01:10:08,707
He's right. We're going to go to the Cannes Film Festival.

1144
01:10:08,707 --> 01:10:10,176
And I'm going to win the Best Actor Award.

1145
01:10:11,944 --> 01:10:13,112
Dong Gu.

1146
01:10:15,314 --> 01:10:16,482
It's our food.

1147
01:10:17,616 --> 01:10:19,685
I've brought your meals. You should eat first.

1148
01:10:19,885 --> 01:10:21,053
Welcome, Yoon Ah.

1149
01:10:21,253 --> 01:10:24,089
I see my dear, little Sol's here as well.

1150
01:10:24,457 --> 01:10:26,826
- Is the shoot going well? - Of course.

1151
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:29,495
I can just feel that this will be a big hit.

1152
01:10:30,996 --> 01:10:33,432
Let's eat lunch and continue shooting.

1153
01:10:33,432 --> 01:10:34,900
- Our food's here. - Let's eat.

1154
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:38,137
Excuse me. What do you think you're doing?

1155
01:10:39,805 --> 01:10:42,308
You said you scouted the location.

1156
01:10:42,308 --> 01:10:43,776
You didn't pay the fee again, did you?

1157
01:10:43,976 --> 01:10:46,579
Have we been shooting here without a permit?

1158
01:10:47,746 --> 01:10:49,715
We have a low budget.

1159
01:10:50,549 --> 01:10:53,419
- What will we do? - What else?

1160
01:10:53,786 --> 01:10:55,754
- Run! - My goodness.

1161
01:10:56,288 --> 01:10:57,523
Darn it.

1162
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,291
- Run. - All right.

1163
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:01,227
- Hurry. Run. - Stop right there.

1164
01:11:13,405 --> 01:11:17,309
(We'd like to thank the viewers for watching Welcome to Waikiki.)

1165
01:11:18,077 --> 01:11:19,945
(Special thanks to guest stars Jung Kyu Soo and Kim Jin Woo.)

1166
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:53,779
(Welcome to Waikiki)
