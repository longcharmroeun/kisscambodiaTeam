1
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:15,452
Dong Gu.

2
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:20,557
Yoon Ah, there's something I want to tell you.

3
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,392
What? What is it?

4
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,328
I like you.

5
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:28,498
I really like you, Yoon Ah.

6
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,542
Dong Gu, this is so unexpected.

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,311
I like you, Yoon Ah.

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,579
So...

9
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:45,982
do you want to go out with me?

10
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,056
I don't want to go out with you.

11
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:56,192
What? Why?

12
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:59,963
Is it because of your situation?

13
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:03,233
Don't worry. I asked you out...

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,402
because I'm prepared to take responsibility for you and Sol.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,070
I didn't ask you to...

16
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,839
take responsibility for me and Sol.

17
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,075
That wasn't what I meant.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,779
Then do you think that a single mom with a child like me...

19
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,580
should always agree to go out with...

20
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,683
people like you if they ask me out?

21
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:23,219
- Yoon Ah, that's not what I meant. - Don't.

22
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,121
Let's pretend this never happened.

23
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,458
Yoon Ah.

24
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,899
Here. You left your phone in the car.

25
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:38,968
Thank you. Take care.

26
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:40,904
Bye.

27
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:58,888
- Are you all right? - Soo Ah.

28
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,290
Did she just dump me?

29
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,926
Yes, and it only took five seconds.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,227
Five seconds?

31
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,062
Why?

32
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:07,731
Why?

33
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:11,334
Chewbacca, what are you doing this weekend?

34
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,002
Trainees have no weekends.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,305
I need to watch all the dramas and reality shows to write reviews.

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,107
They always make me do these things.

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,274
Gosh.

38
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,377
You really wanted to be a reporter.

39
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,011
Now that you've become one, are you not satisfied?

40
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:25,448
My ears are itchy.

41
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:28,051
Chewbacca.

42
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,653
To celebrate on your becoming a reporter, pick my ears for me.

43
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:33,857
I think there's something big in here.

44
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,958
Take a look.

45
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,193
What are you doing? Pick my ears.

46
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,399
What... What are you doing?

47
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:46,136
You could've told me if you didn't want to. Why did you push me?

48
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,337
I didn't.

49
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:49,773
Gosh.

50
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:54,411
Yoon Ah, please talk to me.

51
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,045
Why don't you want to go out with me?

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,014
You can dump me all right, but I want to know the reason why.

53
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,516
What? What?

54
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,685
What? Dumped? What is this about?

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,920
Get lost!

56
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,156
Tell me. What's the reason?

57
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,625
I don't want to go out with you.

58
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:11,995
I don't want to talk about it. Can I go now?

59
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:15,632
Hey, what is this about?

60
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,067
You like Yoon Ah?

61
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,602
He does.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,704
But he got dumped in five seconds.

63
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,772
What?

64
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:24,707
Five seconds?

65
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,943
Five seconds? Really?

66
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:30,947
Dong Gu, where are you going?

67
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,421
Yoon Ah, there's something I want to tell you.

68
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,123
I like you.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,825
I really like you, Yoon Ah.

70
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:54,571
I don't want to go out with you.

71
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:59,108
I didn't ask you to take responsibility for me and Sol.

72
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:08,751
(Night of the Living Dead)

73
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:15,225
Gosh, it's so noisy.

74
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:21,998
What are you doing here?

75
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:26,636
Soo Ah, am I that unattractive?

76
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,538
I'm not that bad, am I?

77
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,574
I look okay, and I'm tall.

78
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:33,810
I'm tall, and...

79
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,848
I'm tall. That's right.

80
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,452
I mean, I'm not that bad, am I?

81
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,023
Do you want the truth or a sugar-coated lie?

82
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,258
Forget it.

83
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:50,226
Whatever.

84
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:51,694
I'm going to the bathroom.

85
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:01,771
(Brother)

86
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,440
Gosh. He thinks I'm in the US.

87
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,414
Hello.

88
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,783
Hey, how are you?

89
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,685
What's the matter?

90
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,887
I'm your brother.

91
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:20,256
I couldn't even see you off when you left for the US.

92
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,058
I wanted to hear your voice.

93
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:24,460
I got back from training today.

94
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,196
That's right. You have a match soon, right?

95
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,831
I'm leaving for Hong Kong in two days.

96
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:30,867
How's life in the US?

97
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,735
I love it.

98
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,203
Everything is good. Very good.

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,471
I'm glad to hear that.

100
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:40,009
I can't talk long right now.

101
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:41,945
By the way, it's an overseas call,

102
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,347
but it sounds as if you were right next to me.

103
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,783
Technology has improved a lot.

104
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,619
I'll call you back soon.

105
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,054
All right.

106
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,022
- Bye. - Take care.

107
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,092
- Soo Ah. - Hey.

108
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,760
What are you doing here?

109
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,962
You're supposed to be in the US.

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,964
The thing is...

111
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,800
- Let me explain. - Soo Ah, let's go home and sleep.

112
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,001
I'm tired.

113
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:06,636
Wait. Dong Gu.

114
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,471
Soo Bong.

115
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,907
Hold on. "Let's go home and sleep?"

116
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:12,475
Do you live together?

117
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,811
- You broke up. - Well...

118
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,913
I broke up with Yoon Seok and got back together with Dong Gu.

119
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:21,985
I didn't want to worry you, so I lied to you that I was in the US.

120
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,988
Really? But why are you living with Dong Gu?

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,222
What happened to your apartment?

122
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,391
Well... The thing is...

123
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,027
We're going to get married anyway.

124
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,062
Dong Gu wanted me to move in with him and save money.

125
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:37,100
Are you two getting married?

126
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:40,670
Really? Guys, it's cold.

127
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,405
Let's go to your guesthouse. Come on.

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,741
- We'll be right there. - Okay.

129
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:46,676
What are you doing right now?

130
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,645
I'm sorry. You know what my brother is like.

131
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,647
Please help me this once.

132
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,916
Soo Bong will kill me if he finds out I was conned.

133
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,418
Fine.

134
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,187
Wait. Isn't Jun Ki at the guesthouse?

135
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,257
Dong Gu likes Yoon Ah?

136
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,925
Isn't it so unexpected?

137
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,495
What's even funnier is that he got turned down in five seconds.

138
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:07,830
We should call him...

139
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,699
Five Seconds from now on.

140
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,401
Five Sec for short.

141
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:13,803
Five Sec.

142
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:16,639
- 5 Sec, 5 Sec - 5 Sec, 5 Sec

143
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,808
- 5 Sec, 5 Sec - 5 Sec, 5 Sec

144
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,777
Who is it?

145
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:23,379
- It's Dong Gu. - Five Sec?

146
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:25,648
Hello, Five Sec.

147
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:28,584
Guess what? It's your new nickname.

148
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,355
What?

149
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:34,424
Soo Bong?

150
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:36,592
He's coming here?

151
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:38,895
You mean here?

152
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,363
Gosh.

153
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:42,432
- What's going on? - I don't know.

154
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,201
I'll run away. Call me when he's left, okay?

155
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,804
If he sees me, he'll kill me.

156
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,207
It's been such a long time.

157
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,843
I'm back! Soo Bong is here too!

158
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,645
Soo Bong hasn't been here in a while.

159
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,382
How long has it been?

160
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,885
- Du Shik, Seo Jin. - Hi.

161
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,387
It's been such a long time.

162
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,722
You guys.

163
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,357
I missed you, sweeties.

164
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,460
- He's in the cabinet. - In the cabinet?

165
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,261
You're strong as always.

166
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,931
You cuties.

167
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,900
It's so nice to see you.

168
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,436
I'm a bit disappointed in you guys.

169
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,638
Dong Gu and Soo Ah are back together,

170
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,241
and you haven't said anything to me?

171
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:28,544
What? Soo Ah and Dong Gu are back together?

172
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,712
I told him.

173
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,614
I told him we were back together.

174
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:35,752
I see. Soo Ah wanted us to keep it a secret.

175
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:39,956
You guys are such good friends.

176
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,391
A man should be loyal to his friends.

177
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,027
- Loyalty! - Loyalty!

178
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,129
Loyalty.

179
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:49,732
Nothing much seems to have changed here.

180
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,174
What's this?

181
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,042
That's Jun Ki.

182
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:04,914
Why is it still here?

183
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:09,719
Why would you keep a picture of a dead person?

184
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:14,857
Jun Ki.

185
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:20,496
I still can't believe he's dead.

186
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,932
Jun Ki.

187
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:28,070
Jun Ki.

188
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:31,541
Who would have known he'd die like that?

189
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,843
How could he get hit by lightning?

190
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,077
Exactly.

191
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,713
I'm sure it was his punishment.

192
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,715
How dare he steal a friend's girlfriend?

193
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,384
My girlfriend at that?

194
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,986
I shouldn't say bad things about a dead person,

195
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,122
but it might be a good thing that he died like that.

196
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,458
If he had been caught by me,

197
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:53,262
he would have spent the rest of his life...

198
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,565
at the hospital, half dead.

199
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,804
Jun Ki, you have some mails...

200
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:04,907
Where is Jun Ki?

201
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,175
- No. - No.

202
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,178
What is she talking about?

203
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,547
Yoon Ah, there you go again.

204
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,150
- Jun Ki is dead, remember? - What?

205
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,252
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,254
- He was here a moment ago. - Yoon Ah!

207
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,589
You didn't take your medicine today, did you?

208
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,157
You should never skip your medicine.

209
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,325
Follow me.

210
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,926
- Throw away this trash. - What are you...

211
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,062
- You haven't come to your senses? - Jun Ki...

212
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,330
Come with me.

213
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,501
What was that all about? Who is she?

214
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,537
She works here.

215
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:37,607
She is still not over Jun Ki's accident.

216
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,009
She believes Jun Ki is alive.

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,344
Really?

218
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,613
That's too bad. She's so young.

219
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:46,215
Keep quiet.

220
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:48,417
Does medicine help?

221
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,053
What?

222
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,890
Jun Ki stole Soo Ah's brother's girlfriend?

223
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,026
Yes. Soo Bong was so determined...

224
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,328
to kill Jun Ki.

225
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,398
So you lied to him that Jun Ki died?

226
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,067
We tried to stop him, but it was Jun Ki's idea.

227
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,137
The thing is, Soo Bong is a UFC fighter.

228
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,639
He is a human weapon.

229
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,741
19 wins by KO out of 19.

230
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,743
Still, how could you tell such a lie?

231
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:16,379
Where is Jun Ki right now?

232
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:29,859
Why did he have to show up here?

233
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:32,428
Gosh, it's so uncomfortable.

234
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,397
I hope he'll be gone soon.

235
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,668
What was that noise?

236
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:40,536
I think it came from there.

237
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:48,411
Sorry. I have a cold.

238
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:51,147
Really?

239
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:52,882
Seo Jin.

240
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,418
- Do you still have a mustache? - What?

241
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:59,488
I've had it all my life.

242
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,624
I'm so tired.

243
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,961
It's getting late. Shouldn't you be going?

244
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:08,030
Well, I guess I should get back.

245
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,468
Hello, Coach.

246
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,637
Really?

247
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,038
Okay.

248
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,041
- Gosh, this is not good. - What's wrong?

249
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,910
Our boiler broke down.

250
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:22,411
What should I do?

251
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:26,849
I could stay here.

252
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:30,586
Dong Gu, I'm going abroad in two days.

253
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:32,521
Can I stay here until then?

254
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:35,691
What?

255
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:37,860
Two days?

256
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:39,462
No.

257
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,165
You have a match in a few days. You should take care of yourself.

258
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,534
With so many people, it'll be noisy and uncomfortable here.

259
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,269
Don't worry.

260
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:49,739
I'm used to staying with many people for training.

261
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,208
That's right.

262
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,243
But there is no vacant room at the moment.

263
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,611
I can sleep on the sofa too.

264
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,613
I'll sleep on the sofa. Use my bed instead.

265
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,515
I hate causing others trouble.

266
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,651
Let's go grab some beer for old times' sake.

267
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,621
I'm watching my weight for the match. I can't drink.

268
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:08,991
Also, I want to watch some dramas I couldn't watch during training.

269
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:12,028
- Please. - Don't worry and go to bed.

270
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,195
Still...

271
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:16,632
Okay. Make yourself comfortable.

272
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,534
That handgrip is scary.

273
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:20,703
- Have a good time. - Okay.

274
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:23,506
- Enjoy. - All right.

275
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:31,814
It's fun.

276
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:33,482
It's so fun.

277
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:37,286
Kim Nam Joo. Goodness.

278
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:39,355
That's amazing.

279
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,123
What should I watch now?

280
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:44,560
That's right. "Wife's Desire".

281
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:47,163
I heard that the twist is shocking.

282
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:50,066
Why is he still watching dramas? It's so late.

283
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:52,068
I have to pee, and my legs feel numb.

284
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,203
I'm going crazy.

285
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:56,505
Gosh, I have to pee.

286
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,474
What should I do?

287
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:09,718
Did I ask you to be responsible for me and Sol?

288
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,787
Let's pretend this never happened.

289
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,590
I don't want to go out with you.

290
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:25,067
Dong Gu, I have to pee. Help me.

291
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:30,539
Du Shik, I have to pee. Please save me.

292
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,813
(News Report, "Female Directors Are Popular Now")

293
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,851
I'm tired of it. It never ends.

294
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:45,020
Is Jun Ki okay?

295
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:49,024
Why do I keep caring about him?

296
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:52,094
Gosh, I must be insane.

297
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,829
Come to your senses.

298
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,031
What is it?

299
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:59,635
I'm going to pee.

300
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,870
Please help me.

301
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,771
Why do I care about him...

302
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,610
I can start from the eighth episode.

303
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:11,981
Goodness, I'm so excited.

304
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:17,887
I'm at the center tonight

305
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,288
It's me

306
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,757
- Why aren't you sleeping? - Pardon?

307
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,260
I'm looking for something.

308
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,795
- I see. - Where was it?

309
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:30,766
I only wait for you, it's me

310
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,301
Why are you holding a plastic bottle?

311
00:15:32,605 --> 00:15:33,936
Pardon?

312
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,139
I just wanted to hold something.

313
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,141
It feels like something is missing.

314
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,745
I'm the one who will...

315
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,880
steal your heart away

316
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,082
Thank you, Seo Jin.

317
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:57,326
What's that sound?

318
00:15:58,205 --> 00:15:59,595
Is water leaking?

319
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,464
What sound?

320
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,500
I don't hear anything.

321
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:07,503
- I heard it. - Let's watch a drama.

322
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,972
The volume is too low.

323
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,874
It's too loud.

324
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:16,312
It's because I'm a little deaf.

325
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:25,020
It's overflowing.

326
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,423
Gosh, it's overflowing.

327
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,065
However

328
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,100
That person

329
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:41,971
It's me, it's me

330
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:44,306
I'm at the center tonight

331
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:47,576
It's me, it's me

332
00:16:58,065 --> 00:16:59,355
Dong Gu.

333
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,190
What are you doing early in the morning?

334
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:02,791
What are you writing?

335
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:06,895
What is it?

336
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,299
(Why? No. I Refuse.)

337
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,600
What?

338
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:15,804
Did you do this all night?

339
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,274
No matter how much I think, I can't understand.

340
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,042
Du Shik, am I that bad?

341
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,977
No, you're great.

342
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,345
You're the best among all my friends.

343
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,380
Right?

344
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,582
Why does Yoon Ah not like me?

345
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,385
Shouldn't she consider it when I confessed to her?

346
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,552
That's true.

347
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,055
How did you confess to her?

348
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,491
In front of the guesthouse yesterday,

349
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,160
I told Yoon Ah that I like her and I want to date her.

350
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,396
I confessed to her like a man.

351
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:41,930
Wait.

352
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:44,400
Did you confess to her on the street?

353
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,235
Without even a flower?

354
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,903
Yes. What's wrong with that?

355
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,738
That's not right.

356
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,340
If you confessed like that on the street,

357
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,474
I wouldn't have accepted it.

358
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,609
Really?

359
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,078
Is that why?

360
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,347
- Yes. - Now I understand.

361
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,682
Du Shik.

362
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,350
Even I don't make that mistake.

363
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,586
I thought it was manly, but I was wrong.

364
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,222
By the way, is Jun Ki still hiding?

365
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:17,533
I fell asleep.

366
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,335
Gosh.

367
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:23,405
Is it morning?

368
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,176
I can't tell day and night in here.

369
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,314
My legs are asleep.

370
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:35,551
By the way,

371
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,853
is he still there?

372
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,925
What's going on?

373
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:44,660
That's amazing.

374
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,562
Why is he...

375
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,098
watching so much drama?

376
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:53,335
Are you saying that you're my father's daughter?

377
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,739
His daughter-in-law was his real daughter.

378
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:58,207
That's unbelievable.

379
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:02,478
I can't believe it.

380
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:05,514
Did you sleep well?

381
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,484
Yes.

382
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,918
You should have breakfast.

383
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,019
No thanks.

384
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,689
I have to watch this, so be quiet.

385
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,357
She was freeloading.

386
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,226
30 years ago,

387
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:20,362
you abandoned a woman named Geum Nan.

388
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:22,464
How do you know her?

389
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,267
I'm her daughter.

390
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,569
What? You are?

391
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:30,339
- Goodness. - Are you my daughter too?

392
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,840
His wife was his daughter?

393
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:36,011
I love this drama.

394
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:39,748
This is incredible.

395
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,023
Is he an athlete...

396
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,792
or someone who monitors dramas?

397
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,260
Why does he watch so much drama?

398
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:54,196
He's a huge fan of dramas.

399
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,564
He spends...

400
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,866
half of his money on watching dramas.

401
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,502
Poor Jun Ki.

402
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,672
By the way, where's Yoon Ah?

403
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,107
She went to class after making breakfast.

404
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,408
She said that she had something to do.

405
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:09,478
Since when did you like Yoon Ah?

406
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,746
It's been awhile.

407
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:13,849
I thought about it a lot, so don't order me around.

408
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,117
Okay.

409
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,554
I'm late, so I'll eat at the convenience store.

410
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:19,788
Wait.

411
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:23,625
I'm coming with you.

412
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,726
Where are you going?

413
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,128
What about Soo Bong?

414
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,296
Before he finds out,

415
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,298
I need to catch Yoon Seok.

416
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,266
He'll kill me if he finds out.

417
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,035
Dong Gu, take care of my brother.

418
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,236
Let's go.

419
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,771
Goodness.

420
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,906
I can't handle him on my own.

421
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,641
I need to get ready for work.

422
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,009
Take care of Sol.

423
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:43,178
Have fun.

424
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,847
Fine. See you later.

425
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,487
Sol.

426
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:53,889
What does your mom like?

427
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,492
How should I confess to her so that she likes me?

428
00:20:58,535 --> 00:20:59,728
What did you say?

429
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:01,296
You said something.

430
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,098
Say something.

431
00:21:05,175 --> 00:21:07,302
Don't say gibberish and say something.

432
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:09,938
Please say something.

433
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:15,511
Why hasn't he appeared yet?

434
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:17,212
I need to catch him before my brother finds out.

435
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:20,048
How should they fight?

436
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,517
Are you still writing it?

437
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,485
Do you earn money with it?

438
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,420
- No. - Then why do you write it?

439
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,789
It's because it's what I like.

440
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,960
Your life seems frustrating as well.

441
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:34,062
What should I write?

442
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:37,099
Do I have to use the finger jab here?

443
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,034
- What's a finger jab? - Finger jab?

444
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,104
It's...

445
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,473
one of Bruce Lee's technique.

446
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,708
It's a frightening technique of making someone...

447
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,343
lose his sight by poking his eyes.

448
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,946
Poke someone's eyes? That's unfair.

449
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,349
The tactic is to end the fight in the least amount of time.

450
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,518
Why would you let someone poke your eyes?

451
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,053
You don't understand.

452
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,556
Finger jab is very fast.

453
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,057
- Shall I show it to you? - Go ahead.

454
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:19,608
See? It's fast.

455
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,276
You can't even see it. Can you avoid it?

456
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,544
Why would I avoid it?

457
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,745
Try it on me.

458
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:25,681
Aren't you afraid?

459
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,283
You'd better not regret it.

460
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:31,520
Then here I go.

461
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:39,161
That hurts. My finger hurts.

462
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,329
Goodness.

463
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:41,863
It makes no sense.

464
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,732
My daughter-in-law and my wife...

465
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:46,101
weren't my real daughters.

466
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,636
I can't...

467
00:22:47,775 --> 00:22:49,938
- stay here anymore. - Goodness.

468
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,907
I must leave here now.

469
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:54,977
Sundown.

470
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:08,523
I should go back to my star.

471
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:11,393
Goodbye, Earth.

472
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:12,828
Goodbye.

473
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:19,868
(Thank you for watching "Wife's Desire".)

474
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:23,972
Bravo. That was amazing.

475
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,041
He was an alien.

476
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,877
The title was "Wife's Desire", but the father was an alien.

477
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,145
What an amazing twist.

478
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:32,547
That was the best drama of my life. That was amazing.

479
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,383
I'll have to own a copy of that drama.

480
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,985
How could the writer think up of something like that?

481
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:41,089
I should come up with a better way to show my feelings to Yoon Ah.

482
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:45,360
With him here, what should I do?

483
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:46,862
I'll have to watch that over again.

484
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:49,531
This is driving me crazy.

485
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:54,403
Yoon Ah. You're here early.

486
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:56,071
Hello.

487
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:58,040
I thought I'd just come early today.

488
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,611
Who...

489
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,013
was that guy yesterday?

490
00:24:07,055 --> 00:24:08,750
He's the owner of the guesthouse.

491
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,519
I see.

492
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:14,089
- I'm just curious. Yesterday... - Hyun Joon.

493
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:17,859
I don't want to talk about that.

494
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,462
All right. I apologize.

495
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:31,306
Soo Ah. I need to go to the restroom.

496
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,341
- Take care of the counter for me. - All right.

497
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,278
Gosh. I'm getting tired of this.

498
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,814
How much longer do I have to be on the watch for him?

499
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,517
Excuse me.

500
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,352
Did you guys get that ramen today?

501
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,521
Pardon? What ramen?

502
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,191
Bba Bba Yen Tom Yum Mutai.

503
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:51,493
Wait a minute.

504
00:24:52,705 --> 00:24:54,162
I know this voice.

505
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:02,804
Why don't they sell it here.

506
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:11,079
Hey. So it is you.

507
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,347
My goodness.

508
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:15,784
Stop right there.

509
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,985
I'm going to kill you.

510
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:22,324
- Wait a minute. - Where do you think you're going?

511
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,558
Give me back my money. Where's my money?

512
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,594
Bba Bba Yen. It's that Thai guy.

513
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:27,562
Move away.

514
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,365
Du Shik. Get him. Get him.

515
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,633
- It's him. It's that swindler. - Move away.

516
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,801
- Get out of my way. - No way.

517
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:36,872
- What are you doing? - Get out of my way.

518
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,573
Put that down. Someone will get hurt.

519
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,942
If you don't want to get hurt, get out of my way, you jerk.

520
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:43,145
Get out of my way. You jerk.

521
00:25:43,615 --> 00:25:46,648
Gosh. Gosh. What should I do? What should I do?

522
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,758
- What are you doing? - What is he doing?

523
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,693
You'll really end up getting hurt.

524
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:05,834
- Finger. Finger. - You jerk.

525
00:26:09,215 --> 00:26:11,973
My finger. It hurts. It hurts.

526
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:13,809
My goodness.

527
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,377
You swindler. You jerk.

528
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,745
Du Shik. Hurry up and call the police.

529
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,413
Gosh. How could you poke my eyes?

530
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,648
Finger Jam.

531
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,450
It's time for me to...

532
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:24,920
return to my land, Biratutura.

533
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:26,788
Farewell.

534
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,156
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

535
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,225
It's my second time around, and it's still amazing.

536
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:32,928
The writer's a genius.

537
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:40,435
After watching dramas all day, my body's aching.

538
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:43,672
I should go for a run.

539
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:51,680
My eyes.

540
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,087
My legs. My legs are asleep.

541
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:00,856
They're killing me. I can't get up.

542
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,562
It's so cold. It's freezing.

543
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:16,705
Jun Ki.

544
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:18,907
You're supposed to be dead.

545
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:20,308
Why are you here?

546
00:27:20,745 --> 00:27:23,678
What's going on? Did you lie to me?

547
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,946
Do you know my brother?

548
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:26,915
What's that supposed to mean? Your brother?

549
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:30,085
You must've mistaken me for my brother, Jun Ki.

550
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:33,221
I'm not Jun Ki. I'm his twin brother,

551
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:34,990
Lee Jun Gu.

552
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,894
- What? You're his twin brother? - Yes.

553
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,263
Jun Ki had a twin?

554
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:45,133
What's going on? What's all this noise?

555
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:52,440
- Dong Gu. - Yes?

556
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,576
- Was Jun Ki a twin? - Excuse me?

557
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:56,511
Dong Gu. It's been a long time.

558
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:59,381
It's me Jun Gu. I'm Lee Jun Gu.

559
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:00,882
Pardon?

560
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,551
That's right. Jun Gu.

561
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,420
How have you been?

562
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,924
Do you mean to tell me that Jun Ki really had a twin brother?

563
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:11,326
I never heard about you.

564
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:14,629
I knew it.

565
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:16,031
He did it again.

566
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,599
He was always like that.

567
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,801
He never wanted to admit that I existed.

568
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:22,470
We were born in the same place at the same time,

569
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:24,906
but he always treated me like a ghost.

570
00:28:25,215 --> 00:28:28,343
Jun Ki. You're playing games with me, aren't you?

571
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,711
How could you say such a thing?

572
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:31,813
Who am I?

573
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:34,382
Do I really not exist?

574
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:38,119
My parents only accepted Jun Ki as their son. I was always alone.

575
00:28:38,895 --> 00:28:40,989
I lived my whole life hating him.

576
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:43,458
I'm Lee Jun Gu.

577
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,494
I'm telling you. Lee Jun Gu really exists.

578
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:55,737
Are you telling me you're really Jun Ki's twin brother?

579
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,938
Yes.

580
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:59,507
Jun Gu. You'll be all right.

581
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,009
You must've been through a lot.

582
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:03,545
I didn't know about this.

583
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:06,581
No. It's all right. I'm used to this happening.

584
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:10,018
- Since you're here, have a seat. - No. That's all right.

585
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:11,886
I'm so heartbroken.

586
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,989
I don't think I'll be able to stay any longer.

587
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:17,292
Then I'll be going now.

588
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:18,626
Wait right there.

589
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:22,297
What's wrong?

590
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:26,501
- Where's Jun Ki? - What do you mean?

591
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,636
As you know, he's dead.

592
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,904
I mean, where's his graveyard?

593
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:33,475
- He was cremated. - Then where's the charnel house?

594
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,179
We meant to place him in one, but we just scattered his ashes.

595
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:40,582
Then there must've been an exact place you scattered his ashes.

596
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:42,417
Please tell me.

597
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:46,254
Better yet, can you take me there?

598
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,822
I'm a bit busy today. I should go.

599
00:29:47,865 --> 00:29:49,391
- Jun Gu. - Yes?

600
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm going abroad tomorrow because I have a game to play.

601
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:54,829
Let me say farewell to my friend before I leave.

602
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:57,198
Is that such a hard thing to ask for?

603
00:30:02,745 --> 00:30:04,072
Drive safely.

604
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:19,220
Jun Gu.

605
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,856
How much longer do we have to go?

606
00:30:22,895 --> 00:30:24,225
Do you hear me?

607
00:30:25,805 --> 00:30:27,195
We're almost there.

608
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:30,065
This is it. This is the spot.

609
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,234
Here? Here?

610
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:35,236
Yes. Yes. This is the place.

611
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:39,340
Then this is where Jun Ki is?

612
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,749
Jun Ki.

613
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,957
Jun Ki. It's me. I came to see you.

614
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:58,827
Jun Ki.

615
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,098
Jun Ki.

616
00:31:07,175 --> 00:31:08,436
How could you?

617
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:11,739
Jun Ki.

618
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:13,875
Jun Ki.

619
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:16,778
I can't believe this.

620
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,280
Are you... Are you...

621
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,282
crying?

622
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,752
To tell you the truth, Jun Ki and I were really close.

623
00:31:25,365 --> 00:31:27,255
We were as close as real brothers.

624
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:31,092
Even when he stole my girlfriend,

625
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,627
I was angry at him at first,

626
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,562
but I managed to forgive him in no time.

627
00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:37,799
Who would have known he would die so suddenly?

628
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:43,972
If he were alive, I would give him a warm hug.

629
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:47,408
It breaks my heart that I'll never be able to do that.

630
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:50,778
Jun Ki.

631
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:52,714
Forgive me.

632
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,817
Forgive me, Jun Ki.

633
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:59,988
I hope you rest in peace up there.

634
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,191
When I meet you in paradise,

635
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:06,161
please be my friend again.

636
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:11,366
Jun Ki. Jun Ki. Jun Ki.

637
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,736
Soo Bong. Soo Bong.

638
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:28,049
Why talk casually to me all of a sudden?

639
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:30,084
It's me. It's me.

640
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,554
I'm your friend, Jun Ki.

641
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,222
What are you talking about?

642
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:36,024
You said you're his twin brother.

643
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,893
You know I don't have a twin.

644
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:42,263
I'm an only child. I'm a four-generation only child.

645
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:46,801
I lied out of fear that you'd beat me to death.

646
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:50,505
It's me. It's me, Jun Ki. It's me,

647
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,973
Lee Jun Ki.

648
00:32:57,085 --> 00:32:59,380
Here. Come here.

649
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:05,353
What are you waiting for?

650
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,690
You said you wanted to give me a warm hug.

651
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,769
Actually, I'm Jun Gu.

652
00:33:22,175 --> 00:33:23,438
You scum.

653
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,273
Wait. I'm Jun Ki's...

654
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,909
You jerk!

655
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,413
Soo Bong! Soo Bong!

656
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,282
Please!

657
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,785
It's not easy to get your money back in cases like this.

658
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,687
It's nearly impossible.

659
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:44,592
(Information Division)

660
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:48,596
Du Shik, what should I do?

661
00:33:49,335 --> 00:33:50,732
What should I do now?

662
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:53,067
I have no money left.

663
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:55,470
The model industry treats me like a useless being.

664
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,305
You can start again now.

665
00:33:59,145 --> 00:34:00,575
Start what?

666
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,211
There's nothing I can do. I didn't even graduate from college.

667
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,481
Never mind. What would I even talk to you about?

668
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,883
You're just a weird guy who writes weird stories.

669
00:34:09,495 --> 00:34:12,120
- What about it? - Are you happy with your life?

670
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:13,821
Aren't you embarrassed?

671
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,090
Why would I care about others?

672
00:34:16,165 --> 00:34:19,227
To others, my work may seem useless.

673
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:22,230
But I'm happy doing what I like best.

674
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:26,334
Soo Ah, everyone has different standards of happiness.

675
00:34:26,645 --> 00:34:28,269
So even now,

676
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,605
you can find something to do for the rest of your life...

677
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,939
that makes you happy.

678
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:33,808
It's too late to start over.

679
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:36,711
I'm already 29 years old.

680
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:39,314
That's not too late.

681
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,249
Do you know the average life span nowadays?

682
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:42,684
It's 80 years old.

683
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:45,053
If you think of your life as a baseball game,

684
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,487
you're only in the third inning.

685
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:49,490
Are you going to quit the game because you're losing then?

686
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:52,026
You don't know if you might get a double or a triple after that.

687
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,127
It might even be a home run.

688
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,063
No one can know until the end.

689
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:56,531
Don't you think so?

690
00:34:57,975 --> 00:35:00,134
- Du Shik. - Yes?

691
00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:02,804
How many innings are there in a baseball game?

692
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:18,486
Why is it so quiet here? Where is everyone?

693
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:23,691
(Dong Gu)

694
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:26,394
Hello?

695
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,096
Yoon Ah, where are you?

696
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,598
I just came to the house after the class finished.

697
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,833
Really?

698
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:35,303
I'm cleaning the third floor right now. Can you help me out?

699
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,739
Sure. I'll be there right away.

700
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:06,734
Dong Gu.

701
00:36:11,615 --> 00:36:12,807
Yoon Ah.

702
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:15,343
I made a mistake yesterday.

703
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:17,845
I want to ask you out properly.

704
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:23,084
I like you, Yoon Ah. I really like you.

705
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:25,853
- I... - Dong Gu, why are you doing this?

706
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:28,022
I told you that I didn't want to.

707
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:29,257
What?

708
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:33,895
Is there something you don't like?

709
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:37,198
I've been decorating this by myself for hours.

710
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:39,100
I'll go downstairs.

711
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,036
Yoon Ah.

712
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:43,604
Yoon Ah!

713
00:36:45,615 --> 00:36:46,874
Yoon Ah.

714
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:49,277
Yoon Ah! Just wait a moment. Yoon Ah!

715
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:51,045
Why are you doing this?

716
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,346
Was it not enough?

717
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,816
Right. The ring!

718
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,151
When I earn more money, I'll...

719
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,687
Whatever you do, my answer will be the same.

720
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:03,558
I don't intend to go out with you.

721
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:06,594
Why?

722
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:09,464
Do you hate me that much?

723
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,366
You can go on a date with me...

724
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,335
and dump me if you don't like me then.

725
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,637
I don't have time to go on dates.

726
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,407
I'm busy as it is with my own life.

727
00:37:20,015 --> 00:37:22,076
So don't do this, all right?

728
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,344
Then I'll wait.

729
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:26,380
I'll wait until you have time.

730
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,682
Don't wait.

731
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:31,919
I want to wait. I want to!

732
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,221
Can't I even do that?

733
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,689
Am I someone...

734
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:37,658
you don't even want to think about to you?

735
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,759
Am I?

736
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:47,835
All right.

737
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:50,705
I understand.

738
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:52,707
I'll stop.

739
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:58,279
I'll stop...

740
00:37:58,855 --> 00:38:00,248
liking you.

741
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:01,983
What are you talking about?

742
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:06,454
You like her?

743
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:09,423
Why do you like her?

744
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:12,693
What is this about?

745
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:23,137
Soo Bong, why are you out here?

746
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:30,678
- Let's go. - What are you doing?

747
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,913
I heard everything.

748
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,182
I heard you were scammed. That's why you're living here.

749
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:37,485
Soo Bong, I...

750
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,187
Be quiet. Go to our parent's house.

751
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,156
Stay there, and keep quiet until you get married.

752
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,258
- Come here. - No. I don't want to.

753
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,395
Then are you going to stay here at Dong Gu's house?

754
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:51,799
Soo Bong, I want to start over.

755
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,301
Start what over?

756
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,070
You've been playing all your life, confident that you'd become a model.

757
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,406
You can't start over now.

758
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:01,108
And do you realize how old you are?

759
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,376
What about my age?

760
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,378
I'm only 29 years old.

761
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,380
- What? - Soo Bong.

762
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,082
Do you know the average life span?

763
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,750
It's 80 years old.

764
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,452
If you compare your life to baseball...

765
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,855
I mean, if you compare your life to the UFC main event,

766
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,358
I'm only in the 2nd round out of all 5 rounds.

767
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,826
Will you throw away your towel and give up...

768
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,428
just because you're losing on the second round?

769
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:23,831
You don't know if there might be an arm bar, a rear naked choke,

770
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,666
or a reversal high kick later on...

771
00:39:25,705 --> 00:39:27,735
until you've finished.

772
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,903
Don't you agree?

773
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:32,873
I still have three rounds left.

774
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:36,477
I still have a lot of time left.

775
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:39,413
So I want to start over again.

776
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:42,883
Can't you trust me for once?

777
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,152
Do you mean it?

778
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:49,824
If you throw away your towel again,

779
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:53,961
you're going to experience my high kick, okay?

780
00:39:54,265 --> 00:39:55,730
All right.

781
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:57,898
Thank you, Soo Bong.

782
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:01,202
Come here.

783
00:40:14,385 --> 00:40:17,184
Yoon Ah, why didn't you go home?

784
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,787
I wanted more practice.

785
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:22,857
Is something wrong? Why the sad face?

786
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:26,494
Is it because of him?

787
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:34,702
I know you don't want to talk about it, but I don't feel good.

788
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,937
He seems like a good guy.

789
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:38,839
Why did you refuse?

790
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:42,877
I know that he's a good man.

791
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,947
I know better than anyone...

792
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:49,517
that he's a good man.

793
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:52,620
But Hyun Joon,

794
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:57,224
I don't want to trust anyone else again.

795
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:00,294
I...

796
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:03,597
don't want to be hurt again.

797
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:20,715
Whatever you do, my answer will be the same.

798
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:24,018
I don't intend to go out with you.

799
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:25,619
Don't wait.

800
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:51,512
Do you feel better?

801
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,813
Yes.

802
00:41:52,955 --> 00:41:55,182
I'm happy I'm not dead.

803
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,518
So are you friends again with Soo Bong?

804
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,186
Of course.

805
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,555
We'll be friends even after death.

806
00:42:03,165 --> 00:42:05,226
Here's your meal.

807
00:42:05,265 --> 00:42:07,628
It's kimchi stew! It looks delicious.

808
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,829
This is great.

809
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:15,102
Dong Gu, let's eat.

810
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,837
It's fine. I don't feel like it.

811
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:20,341
Du Shik, can you look after Sol today?

812
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,710
I need to practice at Hyun Jun's workroom.

813
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,012
Sure. Don't worry.

814
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,313
Then see you later.

815
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:34,188
Yoon Ah has been going to Hyun Joon's studio...

816
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,689
a lot recently.

817
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,092
Could she be interested in him?

818
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:39,794
No way.

819
00:42:39,805 --> 00:42:41,629
Dong Gu, don't worry about it.

820
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,897
I don't.

821
00:42:43,275 --> 00:42:46,567
I'm not interested in Yoon Ah anymore, so just know that.

822
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,402
- That's good. - See you.

823
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,470
Where are you going?

824
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:53,007
Like I said, I'm helping out Director Kim from today.

825
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,709
- You said that? When? - I said it! I did!

826
00:42:55,715 --> 00:42:58,345
I said it many times! You never listen to me!

827
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,814
Will you please listen to me?

828
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:05,186
Why does he always take it out on me?

829
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:08,155
There's no reason to be upset.

830
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,957
- Eat up. - What are you talking about?

831
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,992
Just eat. You look awful after getting beaten up.

832
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,027
(I Really Like You)

833
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:14,428
Gosh, I'm tired.

834
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:16,297
Where were you this morning?

835
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,599
I just got off work.

836
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:20,668
I had to attend previews and interviews,

837
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,503
write up reviews, and run errands all day yesterday.

838
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,306
I'm so tired after running around all night.

839
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:33,314
Are you celebrating getting beaten up?

840
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:37,084
"Just finished acting practice."

841
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:38,586
"Drinking coffee."

842
00:43:38,795 --> 00:43:41,956
"Caffeine keeps me alive."

843
00:43:42,565 --> 00:43:43,991
What are you doing?

844
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,626
I've created a social media profile.

845
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:47,027
Do you want to take a look?

846
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:48,729
I'll give you the honor.

847
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:50,397
What is it?

848
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:53,367
Gosh, that's so cringe worthy.

849
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,135
Why did you decide to do it?

850
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:58,572
Social media helps you communicate with your fans.

851
00:43:58,572 --> 00:43:59,673
Don't be absurd.

852
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:02,142
You don't even have any followers. How are you going to communicate?

853
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,244
- You communicate with yourself? - Here.

854
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:04,812
I only just started.

855
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:07,147
I'll be getting so many followers soon.

856
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,549
My goodness.

857
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:11,852
Chewbacca, pretend you're my fan, and take a picture with me.

858
00:44:11,852 --> 00:44:13,554
Forget it. I don't want to.

859
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:16,090
Come on. Let's do this.

860
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,092
All right.

861
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,930
Hey, smile.

862
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:24,932
1, 2, 3.

863
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,834
Stop it. Stop bothering me.

864
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,736
Chewbacca! Hey!

865
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,739
Why is she so cold to me these days?

866
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:33,140
She's never liked you.

867
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:34,708
That's right.

868
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,544
I have a shooting.

869
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,980
- Is it that children's drama again? - Yes.

870
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,483
I'll be shooting a battle scene against Aqua Man.

871
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,620
How should I shoot the octopus ink gun?

872
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:48,389
Like this...

873
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:49,857
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

874
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:53,761
See you.

875
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,930
- Gosh, you're gross. - He's crazy.

876
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,965
Have fun.

877
00:45:01,936 --> 00:45:04,538
Why was I blushing?

878
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:06,173
I must be out of my mind.

879
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:08,342
I'm crazy.

880
00:45:12,513 --> 00:45:13,914
Stop beating so fast.

881
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,189
Are you okay?

882
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:25,326
Aqua Man seemed to beat you up so badly.

883
00:45:25,326 --> 00:45:26,660
I'm all right.

884
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,366
How long will we have to do this?

885
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:37,104
Are you okay?

886
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,876
We're in a better situation than him at least.

887
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:45,579
We should be grateful that we're not playing Cutlassfish Man.

888
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:46,747
Right.

889
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:49,583
- Did you go to the audition? - What audition?

890
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,586
Director Kim Jin Ho is starting a new drama.

891
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,622
Director Kim Jin Ho?

892
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:57,491
The one who directed "Son's Revenge",

893
00:45:57,491 --> 00:45:59,727
which received a rating over 40 percent?

894
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:02,763
The one who turns every drama into a success?

895
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,933
Yes. I went to the audition yesterday.

896
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:07,568
- Really? - Yes.

897
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:10,471
I missed it.

898
00:46:10,738 --> 00:46:12,840
Could there be a way to audition now?

899
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:30,591
Hey!

900
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:32,860
Hey!

901
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:35,929
Why would he have the volume up so high?

902
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,032
Hey!

903
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,200
Hey!

904
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:41,869
Jun Ki.

905
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:43,437
It's been a while.

906
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:44,938
What brings you here?

907
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:49,610
I heard you were assisting Director Kim in his new drama.

908
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:51,278
Can I audition?

909
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:52,479
- What did you say? - Gosh.

910
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,249
- Why did you have to yell? - What?

911
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:57,251
I can't hear you.

912
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:58,986
Speak louder.

913
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,288
Why are you yelling at me?

914
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:06,026
I'm sorry. While shooting a bombing scene,

915
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:08,562
I injured my ears.

916
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:09,730
Really?

917
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,032
- Will you be all right? - Yes.

918
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:15,702
I'll be okay after treatment.

919
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:17,871
Right.

920
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:19,606
What were you saying?

921
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:23,077
Can I audition for...

922
00:47:23,077 --> 00:47:25,212
Director Kim's new drama?

923
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:26,980
The audition is already over.

924
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:32,219
I know. Could you talk to the director...

925
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:34,755
so that he'll give me a chance to audition?

926
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:37,224
He's probably too busy.

927
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:38,559
He's speaking too loudly again.

928
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,261
Seo Jin.

929
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:43,430
Jun Ki.

930
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:46,600
- Do you have an interview here? - Yes.

931
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:50,537
You sure look like a reporter now.

932
00:47:56,677 --> 00:47:58,745
What are you doing?

933
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:03,817
What's with her?

934
00:48:05,352 --> 00:48:06,920
Does she hate me that much?

935
00:48:08,689 --> 00:48:13,393
Please let me audition.

936
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,663
- Okay. I'll talk to the director. - Are you sure?

937
00:48:16,663 --> 00:48:20,400
- In return, do me a favor. - Tell me what it is.

938
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:22,169
I'll do anything for you.

939
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:28,809
I haven't taken a shower in three days. I smell so bad.

940
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:31,678
- Do you have any ideas... - Hyun Joon...

941
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:33,847
who should play the Saudi spy who works for the Korean government?

942
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:36,116
It's hard to find a good Arab actor...

943
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:38,018
who can speak Korean.

944
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:40,654
Gosh, that's a problem. It's an important role.

945
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,723
What is that brat doing?

946
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:44,725
Dong Gu, do you have any ideas?

947
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:46,627
Hyun Joon!

948
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,195
Gosh.

949
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:50,464
Hyun Joon? What do you mean?

950
00:48:50,564 --> 00:48:51,798
Sorry?

951
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:53,600
Oh, you mean Shin Hyun Joon.

952
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,969
Are you saying he should dress like an Arab...

953
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:57,804
and play the role?

954
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:01,942
Wouldn't it look unnatural if he plays an Arab?

955
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,210
It'd be funny.

956
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,779
It's a shift in viewpoint.

957
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:08,215
- Try contacting him. - Okay.

958
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:10,584
- Dong Gu. - Yes?

959
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:13,987
I love your ideas. You're good at this. Well done.

960
00:49:13,987 --> 00:49:15,222
Thank you.

961
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,891
Good for you. I thought of Shin Hyun Joon too.

962
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:19,960
- Sorry? - But you were faster than me.

963
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,562
Sorry.

964
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:24,765
Whatever.

965
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,407
I wanted to treat you to something nicer than tteokbokki.

966
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,342
What are you talking about? This is nice too.

967
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:37,978
It tastes better because it's your treat.

968
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,648
You're letting me use your studio...

969
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,283
and teaching me baking skills.

970
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:45,352
I really wanted to treat you to something nice.

971
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:48,021
Tteokbokki is enough for me.

972
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,227
Are you sure it's enough?

973
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:55,028
It tasted really nice.

974
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,905
- Gosh, my back. - My goodness.

975
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:06,373
Are you okay?

976
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,709
- Try to get up. - I'm sorry.

977
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:10,577
Hey!

978
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:12,446
- Try to get up. - Okay.

979
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:14,982
Be careful.

980
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:17,451
Gosh, I'm so tired.

981
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:21,121
I've running around all day.

982
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:25,492
I need some sleep.

983
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:28,862
I need sleep.

984
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,602
(Jun Ki)

985
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,805
- What is it? - Seo Jin.

986
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:40,207
Do you have some time?

987
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,775
- Why? - Guess what?

988
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:43,410
I'll treat you to some nice food.

989
00:50:43,644 --> 00:50:45,245
Come here.

990
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,249
Where are you? Okay.

991
00:50:51,852 --> 00:50:54,721
Gosh, why does he want me to come all the way there?

992
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:02,896
Gosh, I really don't want to do this.

993
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm doing you a favor.

994
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,568
This is so annoying.

995
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,491
I'm here.

996
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:32,759
Hi.

997
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,996
Why did you want me to come here?

998
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:37,998
I was so tired after working all night.

999
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:42,035
The thing is, I have a favor to ask.

1000
00:51:42,035 --> 00:51:43,870
What is it?

1001
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,505
Well...

1002
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:47,541
Over here.

1003
00:51:53,613 --> 00:51:54,948
Who is he?

1004
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:57,851
He is a producer I know.

1005
00:51:58,652 --> 00:52:00,787
Let me introduce you to each other.

1006
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:03,657
This is my friend's sister, Kang Seo Jin.

1007
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:08,095
This is Kim Jae Woo, a producer at JBC.

1008
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:10,497
Hello.

1009
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,165
Hello!

1010
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:14,067
My name is Kim Jae Woo!

1011
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:15,502
Nice to meet you!

1012
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:17,337
Gosh.

1013
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:20,006
Why is he yelling?

1014
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:22,476
He injured his ears while shooting.

1015
00:52:22,509 --> 00:52:24,678
He'll recover soon. Don't worry.

1016
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:27,481
Jae Woo!

1017
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,649
Your voice is too loud!

1018
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:32,519
Please control it!

1019
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:35,122
I'm sorry. I apologize.

1020
00:52:37,057 --> 00:52:40,127
Why is he here?

1021
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:43,096
He said that he liked you.

1022
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:46,133
He wanted me to set him up with you on a blind date.

1023
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,034
A... A blind date?

1024
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:51,838
Jun Ki, can we talk in private?

1025
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,410
What are you doing?

1026
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,745
How could you do this without telling me?

1027
00:52:58,745 --> 00:53:00,380
- I'm leaving. - Hey.

1028
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,349
You can't just leave.

1029
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:07,287
To be honest, there's an audition I want to try.

1030
00:53:07,621 --> 00:53:09,689
He's the assistant director.

1031
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:11,925
He said that...

1032
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:14,861
if I introduced you to him, he'd give me a chance to audition.

1033
00:53:15,162 --> 00:53:17,464
Don't you feel bad for me...

1034
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:19,833
who always has a hard time?

1035
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:24,638
Seo Jin, please let me ask you for a favor.

1036
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:26,940
Just this once.

1037
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:31,578
Fine. However,

1038
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:33,213
I'm leaving after a meal.

1039
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,916
Thank you so much, Seo Jin.

1040
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,685
Please take good care of him.

1041
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:39,820
You can do it.

1042
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:46,760
He's such a jerk.

1043
00:53:48,795 --> 00:53:52,065
Seo Jin. What would you like to eat?

1044
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,801
Let's just eat...

1045
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:58,071
gorgonzola pizza and carbonara spaghetti.

1046
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,206
Pardon?

1047
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:02,042
I can't hear you. Can you speak...

1048
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,277
more loudly?

1049
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:09,549
Let's get gorgonzola pizza and carbonara spaghetti.

1050
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,787
Gorgonzola pizza and carbonara spaghetti?

1051
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:15,622
What would you like to drink?

1052
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:17,090
Grapefruit-ade, please.

1053
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:19,025
Grapefruit-ade?

1054
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:20,961
Excuse me. I'd like to order.

1055
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:22,229
We heard you.

1056
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:25,565
The chef is already making your order.

1057
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:26,666
Thank you.

1058
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,368
This is embarrassing.

1059
00:54:29,169 --> 00:54:30,537
I'm going to the restroom.

1060
00:54:30,537 --> 00:54:33,573
- Pardon? - I'm going to the restroom!

1061
00:54:33,573 --> 00:54:35,308
I see. Go ahead.

1062
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:36,776
Release it.

1063
00:54:39,746 --> 00:54:41,114
I'm home.

1064
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:43,316
Hello.

1065
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,152
How was it? Did you enjoy working on a movie?

1066
00:54:46,853 --> 00:54:49,422
It's just hectic.

1067
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:50,857
What is it?

1068
00:54:50,857 --> 00:54:52,659
What's this smell?

1069
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:58,431
These are socks.

1070
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:01,868
The director asked me to wash them because he has no time.

1071
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:03,670
Gosh.

1072
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,740
Why are you taking care of Sol? Where's Yoon Ah?

1073
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:09,442
She isn't back yet since this morning.

1074
00:55:09,442 --> 00:55:11,144
What? Not yet?

1075
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:12,712
It's so late.

1076
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:15,181
Why? Are you worried?

1077
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:16,850
You said that you don't care about her anymore.

1078
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,519
I'm not worried at all.

1079
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:22,556
It's because I'm hungry.

1080
00:55:23,256 --> 00:55:24,558
It's Yoon Ah.

1081
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:26,960
Hello, Yoon Ah.

1082
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:30,096
Is that so? I see.

1083
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:32,465
Okay, I got it.

1084
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,102
Was it Yoon Ah? What did she say?

1085
00:55:36,102 --> 00:55:37,671
She said that she'll be late.

1086
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:40,140
She's at Song Hyun Joon's house.

1087
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,875
He got hurt, and his child is sick,

1088
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:43,710
so she has to nurse him.

1089
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,111
Does that mean...

1090
00:55:45,111 --> 00:55:47,414
that they're alone in the house?

1091
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:49,115
At this late hour?

1092
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:52,185
What if something happens between them?

1093
00:55:52,185 --> 00:55:55,455
- You must be worried, Dong Gu. - Stop it.

1094
00:55:55,488 --> 00:55:59,125
What are you talking about? I'm not worried at all.

1095
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,728
I should get some sleep.

1096
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,069
Hello? Director?

1097
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:10,570
Your socks?

1098
00:56:12,138 --> 00:56:14,574
Okay, I'll be right there.

1099
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:16,977
What's wrong with him?

1100
00:56:16,977 --> 00:56:18,378
What is it?

1101
00:56:19,145 --> 00:56:21,581
My director is on location scouting.

1102
00:56:21,581 --> 00:56:24,317
He says that he has to wear certain socks for it.

1103
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:25,919
He wants me to bring them.

1104
00:56:25,952 --> 00:56:28,254
Gosh, it's so late.

1105
00:56:28,355 --> 00:56:29,889
I'll be back.

1106
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:34,160
Socks for location scouting?

1107
00:56:34,294 --> 00:56:36,262
- Do they exist? - I don't know.

1108
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,331
Do they help with location scouting?

1109
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:40,600
Why isn't she answering?

1110
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:43,103
Why isn't she answering her phone?

1111
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:44,471
Goodness.

1112
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,541
Why are the lights off?

1113
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:49,976
Why is no one here?

1114
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:51,311
What's going on?

1115
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:54,481
Where's Hyun Joon?

1116
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,516
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah?

1117
00:56:56,816 --> 00:56:59,085
Why are the lights off? Why is no one here?

1118
00:56:59,552 --> 00:57:01,021
What's going on?

1119
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:03,957
Where's Hyun Joon?

1120
00:57:04,357 --> 00:57:06,926
- Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah? - Excuse me.

1121
00:57:08,328 --> 00:57:10,864
The class is over. What's going on?

1122
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:14,968
Can you give me Song Hyun Joon's home address?

1123
00:57:14,968 --> 00:57:16,603
- Why? - Pardon?

1124
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:19,572
It's because...

1125
00:57:20,373 --> 00:57:22,208
I have a package delivery.

1126
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:24,377
Mr. Song Hyun Joon has a delivery.

1127
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:26,146
- Let me see it. - Okay.

1128
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:29,249
His name was written somewhere.

1129
00:57:29,249 --> 00:57:31,618
Wait, sir. His name was definitely here.

1130
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:34,954
There's a name of the sender.

1131
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:37,223
Here it is.

1132
00:57:37,223 --> 00:57:38,591
Here's his name.

1133
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:40,260
Song Hyun Joon.

1134
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,362
It's a package delivery,

1135
00:57:42,362 --> 00:57:44,364
but why isn't his address written on it?

1136
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:48,168
There are many who write the name but not the address.

1137
00:57:48,168 --> 00:57:50,270
So please tell me Song Hyun Joon's address.

1138
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,006
I can't give you his personal information.

1139
00:57:53,006 --> 00:57:54,741
Just leave it to me.

1140
00:57:54,741 --> 00:57:56,042
I'll give it to him tomorrow.

1141
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:57,277
No.

1142
00:57:57,343 --> 00:57:59,312
It's an urgent delivery.

1143
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:01,614
I have to give it to him right away.

1144
00:58:01,614 --> 00:58:03,983
I think it's food.

1145
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:06,586
It's already rotting.

1146
00:58:06,586 --> 00:58:09,589
Smell it. It smells rotten.

1147
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:11,791
I think it's very expensive.

1148
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,393
I don't know.

1149
00:58:13,393 --> 00:58:14,861
Do whatever you want.

1150
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:17,430
Whether it gets rotten or not,

1151
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:19,032
you're responsible for it.

1152
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:22,869
Please wait.

1153
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:27,440
Yes?

1154
00:58:27,974 --> 00:58:29,275
Who is it?

1155
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,117
- Yoon Ah. - Dong Gu.

1156
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:39,619
Why are you at my director's house?

1157
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:42,188
Your director's house? It's Hyun Joon's place.

1158
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:44,357
That's impossible.

1159
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:47,861
My director asked me to bring him something,

1160
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:49,462
so I'm on an errand.

1161
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:51,731
Did he give me the wrong address?

1162
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:53,166
What happened?

1163
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,001
Who is it?

1164
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:57,437
- It's... - Goodness!

1165
00:58:57,871 --> 00:58:59,072
Hello.

1166
00:58:59,072 --> 00:59:02,275
We met briefly a while ago.

1167
00:59:02,275 --> 00:59:04,177
Right. Hello.

1168
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:05,612
Do you live here?

1169
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:09,349
It's not polite if I just leave.

1170
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:12,685
You'd feel better if I come in and have some tea.

1171
00:59:12,685 --> 00:59:15,755
Don't you have to run an errand?

1172
00:59:17,624 --> 00:59:18,858
Right.

1173
00:59:20,927 --> 00:59:22,362
Yes, Director.

1174
00:59:23,029 --> 00:59:24,531
What?

1175
00:59:24,631 --> 00:59:27,400
You don't need socks for location scouting?

1176
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,103
I see. Okay.

1177
00:59:31,171 --> 00:59:33,206
He's so fickle.

1178
00:59:33,206 --> 00:59:35,909
He said that I don't need to come anymore.

1179
00:59:36,242 --> 00:59:39,546
In that case, I should have some tea.

1180
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:42,415
Yes, please come in.

1181
00:59:43,283 --> 00:59:45,518
Hello, Du Shik. What?

1182
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,688
Okay, I'll be right there.

1183
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:49,823
Okay.

1184
00:59:50,056 --> 00:59:53,026
Dong Gu, Sol can't stop crying.

1185
00:59:53,026 --> 00:59:54,828
I should get going.

1186
00:59:54,828 --> 00:59:57,697
Can you stay here for a while?

1187
00:59:57,697 --> 00:59:58,765
Pardon?

1188
00:59:58,798 --> 00:59:59,933
Me?

1189
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:03,069
His son is sick, and as you can see, Hyun Joon isn't well.

1190
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:04,537
Please take care of them.

1191
01:00:04,637 --> 01:00:08,174
Wait, Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah?

1192
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:41,140
What do you mean?

1193
01:00:41,207 --> 01:00:43,309
Why is Dong Gu at his house?

1194
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:46,145
His director's house must be in the same building.

1195
01:00:46,145 --> 01:00:47,747
Dong Gu thought that it was his director's house.

1196
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:50,516
We bumped into each other when he rang the bell by mistake.

1197
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,584
Really?

1198
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,622
That's such an unlikely coincidence.

1199
01:00:55,622 --> 01:00:57,390
It must be very awkward...

1200
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:59,225
when two strangers are together.

1201
01:00:59,225 --> 01:01:01,594
Let them be.

1202
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:02,929
Nothing won't happen.

1203
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:06,165
You don't get any comments on your social network.

1204
01:01:06,165 --> 01:01:07,567
Why do you keep looking at it?

1205
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:09,802
What? I do get comments.

1206
01:01:09,903 --> 01:01:11,938
My fans write comments.

1207
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,441
Fine, take a look.

1208
01:01:16,609 --> 01:01:17,877
Gosh.

1209
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:22,749
"Cheer up, Jun Ki." "Your acting is the best."

1210
01:01:22,749 --> 01:01:25,018
What? It's true.

1211
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:28,154
What kind of nickname is "junki love"?

1212
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:29,989
Gosh.

1213
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,458
It's true that the world is a big place,

1214
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,427
and it's full of crazy people.

1215
01:01:34,427 --> 01:01:36,296
- Gosh. - What? You're jealous.

1216
01:01:36,296 --> 01:01:39,065
Give it to me. I don't want to talk to someone without fans.

1217
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:43,036
"You're at the destination".

1218
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,470
Gosh, what was that?

1219
01:01:44,637 --> 01:01:46,806
Who turned on the navigation so loudly?

1220
01:01:46,806 --> 01:01:49,709
Seo Jin, I had so much fun today.

1221
01:01:49,709 --> 01:01:50,910
Goodbye.

1222
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:53,279
Thank you for giving me a lift.

1223
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,015
- Take care. - Isn't that Seo Jin?

1224
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:57,917
- Thank you. - Why is she screaming?

1225
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:01,120
It's... Never mind.

1226
01:02:02,622 --> 01:02:03,923
Hello, Seo Jin.

1227
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:10,129
Hey. Seo Jin. Hey.

1228
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:17,303
Seo Jin, what's wrong?

1229
01:02:17,303 --> 01:02:18,604
Did anything happen?

1230
01:02:18,604 --> 01:02:21,641
Can't you see? My eardrums nearly burst because of him.

1231
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:23,142
Just wait patiently.

1232
01:02:23,176 --> 01:02:24,711
He's being treated.

1233
01:02:24,711 --> 01:02:27,613
- He'll be better when it's over. - It's fine.

1234
01:02:27,814 --> 01:02:29,849
Now that you introduced me, are you satisfied?

1235
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:31,451
Wait. Seo Jin.

1236
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:33,753
I have a few days until the audition.

1237
01:02:33,987 --> 01:02:35,688
Can't you see him until then?

1238
01:02:35,688 --> 01:02:37,023
No.

1239
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:39,425
All right.

1240
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:41,527
Okay.

1241
01:02:42,428 --> 01:02:44,597
The audition is hopeless now.

1242
01:02:44,764 --> 01:02:46,432
If the drama succeeds,

1243
01:02:46,432 --> 01:02:48,701
I'll be regretting this moment for the rest of my life.

1244
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:56,376
I think I'm destined to be without fame forever.

1245
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:58,578
All right. All right.

1246
01:02:59,278 --> 01:03:02,815
But only until the audition.

1247
01:03:05,084 --> 01:03:07,687
Seo Jin, thank you. Thank you.

1248
01:03:08,454 --> 01:03:09,722
Let go.

1249
01:03:09,956 --> 01:03:12,658
Take a rest now. Rest.

1250
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:21,100
Jerk.

1251
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:33,846
Gosh, it's so awkward.

1252
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:37,750
Do I have to stay the night with him?

1253
01:03:40,386 --> 01:03:42,188
It's fine.

1254
01:03:42,188 --> 01:03:44,590
I have you guys.

1255
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:47,060
Hey. Dong Gu.

1256
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,461
Dong Gu.

1257
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:51,230
What is it? Why is he calling for me?

1258
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:02,809
- What is it? - I'm sorry,

1259
01:04:03,376 --> 01:04:06,079
but can you come inside and help me?

1260
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,884
What is it?

1261
01:04:13,352 --> 01:04:15,088
What are you doing? Gosh!

1262
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:16,756
Why are you naked? Why!

1263
01:04:16,756 --> 01:04:19,425
Well, you see...

1264
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:22,428
I got myself to the toilet,

1265
01:04:22,728 --> 01:04:25,131
but I can't stand up by myself.

1266
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,067
And?

1267
01:04:28,067 --> 01:04:30,036
Why did you call for me? Why?

1268
01:04:30,403 --> 01:04:32,238
Can you...

1269
01:04:33,339 --> 01:04:35,007
help me up?

1270
01:04:36,342 --> 01:04:38,711
What? Help you up?

1271
01:04:38,711 --> 01:04:41,013
Do I need to help you in that state?

1272
01:04:41,013 --> 01:04:43,950
I can't stand up by myself.

1273
01:04:46,018 --> 01:04:47,353
All right.

1274
01:04:48,688 --> 01:04:51,524
Hold out your hand. Just your hand.

1275
01:04:51,624 --> 01:04:53,960
- I did. - Slowly.

1276
01:04:54,026 --> 01:04:56,429
Your hand. The other one too.

1277
01:04:56,429 --> 01:04:58,197
Make sure I don't touch it.

1278
01:04:58,197 --> 01:05:00,666
- I don't want to touch. - All right.

1279
01:05:02,368 --> 01:05:03,736
Let me go.

1280
01:05:03,736 --> 01:05:05,004
Gosh.

1281
01:05:05,037 --> 01:05:07,206
- Thank you so much. - It's nothing.

1282
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,275
Wait. Can you...

1283
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:11,077
What is it? What?

1284
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:13,112
I'm sorry again,

1285
01:05:14,714 --> 01:05:18,885
but can you help me pull up my pants and underwear?

1286
01:05:19,152 --> 01:05:21,654
I can't bend my back.

1287
01:05:23,823 --> 01:05:25,124
All right.

1288
01:05:27,894 --> 01:05:30,196
Gosh.

1289
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:32,498
Gosh, stand still.

1290
01:05:32,498 --> 01:05:33,699
- I'm sorry. - Gosh.

1291
01:05:34,267 --> 01:05:35,601
I'm sorry.

1292
01:05:37,303 --> 01:05:40,206
Oh gosh. I saw it. I saw it.

1293
01:05:40,206 --> 01:05:42,975
Try to cover it up with something!

1294
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:45,244
Why do you have to do this to me?

1295
01:05:46,812 --> 01:05:48,814
What's wrong? Gosh! I saw it again!

1296
01:05:49,982 --> 01:05:52,084
Why did you fall down? Gosh!

1297
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:54,153
Gosh, why are you doing that?

1298
01:06:00,793 --> 01:06:02,762
Is Dong Gu all right?

1299
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:04,330
I should call him.

1300
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,401
I'm back.

1301
01:06:11,938 --> 01:06:13,472
Hello, Dong Gu.

1302
01:06:13,472 --> 01:06:16,175
- How is his son? Is he all right? - Yes.

1303
01:06:16,175 --> 01:06:17,643
What a relief.

1304
01:06:18,177 --> 01:06:20,479
It must have been awkward with Hyun Joon.

1305
01:06:22,582 --> 01:06:24,116
Did anything happen?

1306
01:06:25,351 --> 01:06:26,652
What?

1307
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:30,122
No, nothing happened.

1308
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:34,460
Yoon Ah, I'm mentally tired right now.

1309
01:06:35,061 --> 01:06:36,562
I need to get some sleep.

1310
01:06:43,469 --> 01:06:44,737
What's wrong with him?

1311
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:46,973
Did they fight?

1312
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:50,576
It can't be. This can't be!

1313
01:06:50,576 --> 01:06:52,678
This couldn't have happened!

1314
01:06:52,678 --> 01:06:53,846
What's wrong with him?

1315
01:07:05,057 --> 01:07:06,659
Gosh, it's too salty.

1316
01:07:06,826 --> 01:07:09,028
Why can't you even cook noodles right?

1317
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:11,230
- Then don't eat it. - It's delicious.

1318
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,099
- Thank you. - Be quiet and just eat.

1319
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:14,834
We've arrived at the destination.

1320
01:07:14,834 --> 01:07:16,135
What's this again?

1321
01:07:16,135 --> 01:07:18,004
Seo Jin must be here.

1322
01:07:18,704 --> 01:07:21,540
You might really hurt your ears if you stay with him.

1323
01:07:23,976 --> 01:07:27,246
Chewbacca. What's that flower?

1324
01:07:28,547 --> 01:07:31,384
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1325
01:07:32,918 --> 01:07:34,253
- Go talk to her. - All right.

1326
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:35,855
Hey, Chewbacca!

1327
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,459
What is that? What is it?

1328
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,128
Did he give it to you?

1329
01:07:42,128 --> 01:07:44,397
It must be working out all right.

1330
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:46,165
He asked me out.

1331
01:07:46,165 --> 01:07:48,267
- Really? - What do you want me to do?

1332
01:07:49,435 --> 01:07:51,570
Should I go out with him?

1333
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:53,105
That's your choice to make.

1334
01:07:53,105 --> 01:07:54,707
- If you don't like him... - Jun Ki.

1335
01:07:55,174 --> 01:07:57,543
- Can I ask you something? - What?

1336
01:07:58,611 --> 01:07:59,979
Am I...

1337
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,782
not a woman to you?

1338
01:08:04,216 --> 01:08:05,685
What are you talking about?

1339
01:08:06,352 --> 01:08:08,254
To me, you're a man.

1340
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:10,556
What should I do?

1341
01:08:11,457 --> 01:08:13,959
Of course, I'm a man. I'm not a woman.

1342
01:08:13,993 --> 01:08:15,361
That's not what I'm saying.

1343
01:08:16,162 --> 01:08:17,463
I think...

1344
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:20,966
I like you.

1345
01:08:24,503 --> 01:08:25,838
What?

1346
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:27,440
I like you.

1347
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:40,686
(Thank you, Tae In Ho, Shin Seung Hwan, and Seol Jung Hwan.)

1348
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:53,799
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1349
01:08:53,799 --> 01:08:55,835
Gosh, why do I have to feel sorry?

1350
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:57,336
Is there something wrong with Seo Jin?

1351
01:08:57,336 --> 01:08:59,271
She hasn't been looking well these past few days.

1352
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:00,873
- Should I look at it? - What is this?

1353
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,608
Kang Seo Jin, what is this?

1354
01:09:02,608 --> 01:09:04,477
- Why did you do it? - Why do you think?

1355
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:06,312
I'm going on a date with Seo Jin today.

1356
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:08,681
What? You won't be seeing her today.

1357
01:09:08,748 --> 01:09:10,549
Seo Jin, we need to talk.

1358
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:13,085
- I want to learn fashion design. - I'll help you.

1359
01:09:13,085 --> 01:09:15,287
Who's the prince that experienced a tragic death?

1360
01:09:15,287 --> 01:09:16,489
Yoo Ah In!

1361
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:18,557
Should we start with English first?

1362
01:09:18,557 --> 01:09:20,526
- Hi, Johnny. - Jane.

1363
01:09:20,526 --> 01:09:22,361
- My mystic. - Mistake.

1364
01:09:22,361 --> 01:09:24,430
It's only because it's been a while. Don't worry.

1365
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:26,565
Why do you care so much about Hyun Joon?

1366
01:09:26,565 --> 01:09:29,201
He's always near Yoon Ah. I don't like that.

1367
01:09:30,636 --> 01:09:32,938
Hyun Joon, you're really good with marbles.

1368
01:09:32,938 --> 01:09:35,441
Hello. Teach me how to play with marbles.

1369
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:36,575
I need to learn.

1370
01:09:36,575 --> 01:09:38,544
I really want to be good at it. Please.

1371
01:09:38,644 --> 01:09:42,415
Song Hyun Joon, you should have a marble match with me.
