00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,984
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah!

4
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,391
You can't come in. It's dangerous.

5
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,493
I know someone in there. Move.

6
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:20,114
- I said it's dangerous.
- I don't care. Just move!

7
00:00:20,114 --> 00:00:23,638
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah!

8
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:25,675
Dong Gu!

9
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:35,377
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

10
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,975
Dong... Dong Gu, what are you doing?

11
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:48,725
Are you hurt at all?

12
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:50,795
You're okay, right?

13
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,012
Yes.

14
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:57,021
But, could you please let go, Dong Gu?

15
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:04,500
Dong Gu, did you come here
because you were worried about me?

16
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,552
What?

17
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:10,197
I was just worried about
the neighborhood people.

18
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:12,506
You were here too, Yoon Ah.

19
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,751
Why did you hug me like that?

20
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,936
Well...

21
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:21,094
I have a habit of hugging people
when I'm worried about them.

22
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,962
Oh, President of the Women's Group!

23
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:26,477
Are you all right? Nothing happened?

24
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,688
President Kang, what's with you?

25
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,027
Mister, are you okay?

26
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:36,855
Mister Policeman, I was obstructing
your work, so I'm sorry.

27
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:39,618
Mister Fireman, oh my!

28
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:43,423
You are working so hard
putting out the fire.

29
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:49,661
Goodness, your heart was
beating hard because of heart problems.

30
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:52,503
- Soul mate?
- Give it a rest.

31
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,813
I'm worried about myself as it is.

32
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,811
What's wrong with you, Su Ah?

33
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:59,250
I broke a dish earlier and got hurt.

34
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,430
You really should be careful.

35
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,772
Where's Dong Gu?

36
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:06,081
I guess something happened because
he ran out like a crazy person.

37
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,491
Oh yeah. There was a fire at
the neighborhood grocery store.

38
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:10,116
- Huh?
- What?

39
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:12,512
- Our neighborhood?
- Yes.

40
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:15,891
Yoon Ah went to the grocery store.
I wonder if she's okay.

41
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:17,131
Yoon Ah? Yoon Ah went there?

42
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,413
Hey, hey. Call her now. Hurry.

43
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:21,054
<i>We're home.</i>

44
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:23,693
Are you okay, Yoon Ah?
I heard there was a fire.

45
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:24,875
I'm okay.

46
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,322
I stopped to buy chicken
on my way to the grocery store.

47
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,682
That's when the fire started.

48
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,701
Really? What a relief.

49
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:34,935
I heard you ran out
like a crazy person,  Dong Gu.

50
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:37,247
Were you going to Yoon Ah?

51
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:39,722
No.

52
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:42,462
I saw our neighbors on the news
and I was worried.

53
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,417
I'm good friends with the President of
the Women's Group, best friends.

54
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,183
- Since when?
- Huh?

55
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:49,590
It's been a long time, a long time now.

56
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,622
I thought something happened to my
best friend and I was so scared.

57
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:05,051
You're so crazy. I'm crazy.

58
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,282
I must really like her.

59
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:09,742
You're crazy, crazy, crazy.

60
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:12,312
Why did you go there?

61
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:15,920
Dong Gu, come out and have some chicken.

62
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,461
No, thanks.

63
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:19,555
I'm in no mood for chicken.

64
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:24,247
Come on. Don't be like that
and come have some.

65
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:28,271
I said I don't want any.
What's wrong with you?

66
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:34,137
We'll leave some for you,
so have it later.

67
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:48,524
You're crazy, so crazy.
You're totally insane.

68
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:51,058
Why did she grab my arm?

69
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:53,112
<i>[Cute Girl]</i>

70
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:55,586
What am I going to do?

71
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:58,082
I was going to eat that.

72
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:00,902
Give it back. Stop that.

73
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:03,043
- What about Dong Gu?
- He doesn't want to eat.

74
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,332
Is something wrong with him?

75
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:06,563
He has the blanket over his head
and won't move.

76
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,243
What? The blanket over his head?

77
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:11,665
Oh, he's mad again.

78
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:15,459
He does that for days whenever he's
mad about something, so don't worry.

79
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:20,935
Sol must be awake.
You should eat without me.

80
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,516
What the heck, Su Ah?

81
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:27,976
You just had a chicken leg
and you're eating another one?

82
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,158
I don't like dry meat.

83
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:32,708
So, you're going to eat
two legs by yourself?

84
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,370
Don't you have a conscience?

85
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,538
You're being too harsh
over one chicken leg.

86
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:38,218
Forget it. I won't eat it.

87
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:39,660
- Don't eat it!
- I'll eat it.

88
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,137
- What was that?
- Oh... oh!

89
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,867
Look at her taking
that chicken leg with her.

90
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,536
She is on a different level
of being shameless.

91
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:51,365
Seo Jin, I have credit card debt to pay.

92
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:52,547
Lend me money if you can.

93
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:54,680
What money? I have none at all.

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,497
Having no money
is nothing to show off about.

95
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,814
Gosh, what have you been
watching all this time?

96
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,646
Isn't this one of those eating shows?

97
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,521
Why would you watch these things?

98
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,608
- It's fun.
- How is it fun?

99
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:08,627
I don't understand people who do these.

100
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:10,983
Why would you film yourself
eating food and show others?

101
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:13,855
They are so pathetic.

102
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,026
Pathetic?

103
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:19,367
Joon Ki, do you know how much
these broadcast jockeys earn?

104
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,966
Popular BJs earn
100 million won in a year.

105
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:24,576
100 million won?

106
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,338
100 million won just for eating?

107
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,117
Yes, 100 million won.

108
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:36,132
100 million won, 100 million won.

109
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,793
Where did Doo Shik put it?

110
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:43,728
You're home?

111
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:47,358
Doo Shik, where's your laptop?

112
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,658
Why do you look like that?

113
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:53,271
These guys were hitting on Mal Geum.

114
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,872
Huh?

115
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:57,918
So, don't tell me you got into a fight.

116
00:05:57,918 --> 00:05:59,211
An innocent guy like you?

117
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:03,574
I got so angry
when I saw Mal Geum crying.

118
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:05,375
I don't know why I did it.

119
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,855
Why else would you?

120
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,764
It's because you like Mal Geum.

121
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:11,706
- You think so?
- Of course.

122
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:15,514
What kind of a guy would get
beaten up for a girl unless he likes her?

123
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:18,785
Don't be like that anymore
and confess your feelings to her.

124
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:21,855
Confess? Forget it.
It's too early for that.

125
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:24,567
Hey, haven't you heard the saying
that love is about timing?

126
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:27,925
Love can go wrong because of
one minute or even one second.

127
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,654
While you sit around contemplating

128
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:32,399
what will you do if another guy
takes Mal Geum away from you?

129
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,377
What? That can't happen.

130
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,432
Joon Ki, how can I do this confession?

131
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:38,932
What do you mean how?

132
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,716
A man has to be
straightforward and driven, you know?

133
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:43,550
Straightforward and driven?

134
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,995
Yeah, but how?

135
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:47,360
Man, you're an amateur.

136
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,370
Look.

137
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,720
Long ago, there was a person
named Lee Joon Ki.

138
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,810
Suppose he sees a woman he likes.
This is his style.

139
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,170
He would walk forward.
Walk straight forward to her.

140
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,574
He has to walk to meet her.

141
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:04,509
How? He walks and stands before her.

142
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,119
How? In a bold way.

143
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,492
Grab her arm.

144
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:11,095
Push her. Push her to the wall.

145
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,103
Oh. Ouch.

146
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:14,209
Then confess your feelings.

147
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,434
How? Like this.

148
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:21,791
Because the days are good
and the days are bad...

149
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,836
I'm sorry. I love you.

150
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:27,336
Do I like you?

151
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:29,189
What are you guys doing?

152
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,879
Are you two dating?

153
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,930
No, what do you mean, dating?

154
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,151
Stop making absurd claims.

155
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:40,278
Continue what you were doing.

156
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:43,675
Whether you date or get married.

157
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,704
My gosh.

158
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:48,423
What does he mean by that? Hey.

159
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:50,983
What are you talking about?

160
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:53,764
Just walk. Keep walking.

161
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:57,670
When will those two ever grow up?

162
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,723
I'm already in
an anxious state, as it is.

163
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:03,499
Dong Gu, you're awake?

164
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,649
Why are you so surprised?

165
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,971
When did I get surprised? Geez.

166
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,350
Aren't you hungry?

167
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,468
I'll warm up the chicken for you,
so wait a little bit.

168
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,257
<i>I like that lady?</i>

169
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:25,427
<i>Why?</i>

170
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:30,548
<i>Does she do her job well?
Is she pretty or cute...</i>

171
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:41,904
<i>She's cute.</i>

172
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:44,874
<i>Was she always this cute?</i>

173
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,860
What are you staring at?

174
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:53,399
What do you mean, I'm staring?
You're one funny lady.

175
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:57,455
Why do you keep snapping at me?

176
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,047
Are you angry at me about something?

177
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,155
No.

178
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:03,736
Then why are you acting like that?

179
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,837
Is it possibly...

180
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:15,706
about the stain on your camera bag?

181
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,864
How do you know about that, Yoon Ah?

182
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:21,817
Was it you who did that?

183
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:24,715
I spilled some sauce while cooking.

184
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:26,565
Forget it. It's not about that.

185
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,705
Then is it about the broken lens cap?

186
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,654
How do you know about that?

187
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,832
Was that you too?

188
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:37,070
I was cleaning up the sauce
and I stepped on the cap.

189
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,903
I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

190
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:45,173
Please don't be mad, okay?

191
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:46,985
Please, please?

192
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:50,769
Stop being angry. I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

193
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:53,692
- I'm sorry.
- I said I'm not angry. Stop it!

194
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:56,354
Dong Gu!

195
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:01,047
Oh no. He must be really mad.

196
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,152
She's cute.

197
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,130
So cute.

198
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:16,394
I nearly forgave her for no reason.

199
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:19,918
How could someone be so cute
while saying sorry?

200
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,423
You startled me.

201
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:28,009
Dong Gu, what are you doing here?

202
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:31,046
It's nothing.

203
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,830
Maybe I should clean.

204
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:35,874
What's with him?

205
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:38,523
Why is his face so red?

206
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:50,076
Joon Ki, I need to borrow your razor.

207
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,505
Gosh.

208
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,976
Is that the only thing you ever
need to borrow from me?

209
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:55,841
Mine is broken.

210
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,139
It's over there.

211
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,240
What are you doing now?

212
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,028
I'm going to do an eating show too.
I have to pay my card bills.

213
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,264
So, you're going to make money
by doing an eating show?

214
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,514
You think anyone can do them?

215
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:08,418
Don't worry about it.

216
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,047
When it comes to eating,
I'm confident I can do well.

217
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:15,529
How come no one's coming in?
I'm going nuts.

218
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:19,731
Oh, there's someone here.
There's someone here now!

219
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,844
<i>[BJ Joon's Chicken Eating Show]</i>
Hello, Gangnam Nouveau Riche.

220
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:27,715
<i>I am the pretty boy BJ of eating shows.</i>

221
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:30,903
<i>I am BJ Joon.</i>

222
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,793
<i>Forget all that. Hurry up and eat.</i>

223
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,125
<i>Ah, okay.</i>

224
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,397
<i>Nouveau Riche, you are very impatient.</i>

225
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:44,258
How dare he talk informally to me?

226
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:46,791
Yes, Nouveau Riche.

227
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:51,360
Then, I will start eating my chicken!

228
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,994
<i>It smells so good.</i>

229
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,620
<i>Yummy. It is crispy.</i>

230
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,206
<i>Gosh, you make it look so yucky.</i>

231
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:11,308
<i>Honestly, this is my first time
doing an eating broadcast.</i>

232
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:17,313
Then, I'll try eating in
a really delicious way this time.

233
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:22,065
Oh!

234
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,734
Oh no.

235
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:26,951
<i>Oh, delicious!</i>

236
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:35,160
Dong Gu, how did work go?

237
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,985
Dong Gu, Dong Gu!

238
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:39,419
What's with him?

239
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:44,070
I think the person Dong Gu
is mad at must be me.

240
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,649
- What?
- I spilled sauce on his camera bag.

241
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,370
- I broke his lens cap too.
- What?

242
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,006
You should've been more careful.

243
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:56,471
The thing he cherishes the most
is his camera.

244
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:59,884
Really? What do I do?

245
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,570
Is there a way to get him to forgive me?

246
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,054
Let me think.

247
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,278
Oh, there is one way.

248
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:09,297
- What is it?
- Acting cute.

249
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:13,229
My brother may look very cold,
but he's weak to people acting cute.

250
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:14,764
Acting cute?

251
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,977
<i>Gosh, I can't even look at her face.</i>

252
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:29,524
<i>But the more I look at her,
the cuter she is.</i>

253
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:32,140
Dong Gu.

254
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,246
Dong Gu, Yoon Ah was wrong.

255
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:39,919
Please forgive me, would you?

256
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,231
What is this?

257
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,216
Why is he being like that?

258
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:56,025
Why else? It's because
you're not cute at all.

259
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:59,130
He usually gets over most things.

260
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,504
You really have no talent at acting cute.

261
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:02,869
Really?

262
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:05,250
I was trying my best.

263
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,668
Was it not cute at all?

264
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:10,339
So cute, so cute, so cute.

265
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,004
Even with a lisp, she's so cute.

266
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:16,096
I thought my heart would stop
when she shook her shoulders like that.

267
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,678
You startled me.

268
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,336
What are you doing here?

269
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:23,840
Huh? It's just...

270
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,634
What? Do you have something to say to me?

271
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,532
No, I don't.

272
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:36,131
Why has he been acting like that
since yesterday?

273
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:38,874
Are you feeling okay?

274
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:41,533
Oh, look at your lips.

275
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,855
They're all cut up.

276
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:45,474
Seriously, those jerks.

277
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:49,073
It's okay. I'm fine so don't worry.

278
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:50,986
Looks like we're starting
the shoot tomorrow.

279
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:52,865
You'll be busy from now on.

280
00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:54,471
I guess so.

281
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:59,261
Maybe I worked out too much this morning.

282
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:01,392
Worked out? What kind?

283
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:02,912
It's called Krav Maga.

284
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:05,376
It's so much fun that
I can't tell time is passing by.

285
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,881
Krav... oh really?

286
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,121
<i>I'm going insane.</i>

287
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:14,604
<i>I have to confess my feelings,
but I have no courage.</i>

288
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:18,020
<i>Okay, a man needs
to be straightforward and driven.</i>

289
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,342
<i>Be a man. Do it.</i>

290
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:22,323
Mal Geum!

291
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:23,657
Yeah?

292
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:37,638
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you all right, Doo Shik?

293
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,936
Yeah, I'm all right.

294
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:45,085
What was that just now?

295
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,163
How did you do that?

296
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:48,971
That's Krav Maga.
Martial arts for real-life fighting.

297
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,481
Won Bin used it in the film
"The Man From Nowhere."

298
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:53,710
Krav Maga isn't like Pilates?
It's martial arts?

299
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,881
Yes, so don't grab my arm suddenly.

300
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:59,368
I will react naturally.

301
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:01,902
Oh, okay. I won't.

302
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:08,989
Hello?

303
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:13,634
Yes, Chairman.
Yes, I'll be there soon. Yes.

304
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,359
I have a fan meeting today,
so I think I have to go.

305
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,428
- What can I do?
- Fan meeting?

306
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,072
You even have fan meetings?

307
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:23,009
Can I go there too?

308
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:25,589
Huh? I don't know about that...

309
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,865
I have something I have to tell you.

310
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:33,965
Cherry, Cherry, Cherry!

311
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:35,702
We're here. This is the place.

312
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:38,908
Oh, okay. Have a good fan meeting.

313
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:40,599
I'll be at a nearby cafe.

314
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,451
Oh, Writer Bong?

315
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,280
Oh, Chairman. Hello.

316
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,384
What brings you here, Writer Bong?

317
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:49,953
Ah, you came to see Cherry's fan meeting.

318
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:52,407
- No, that's not it--
- I'm glad you came.

319
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:55,129
Come on. I'll get you the best seat.

320
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,160
No, that's not it at all.

321
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:11,714
Yes, we will now begin
Cherry's fan meeting.

322
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:16,477
Please give a warm round
of applause for Cherry!

323
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:35,242
Cherry, Cherry, Cherry!

324
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:49,432
Here you go. Can you see the bone?

325
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:52,203
<i>See. What do you think?</i>

326
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:54,584
<i>One, two, three. Clear.</i>

327
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:56,037
Next...

328
00:17:56,037 --> 00:18:00,115
before I eat the next plate of chicken

329
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:03,987
anyone who wishes to send me
stars can do so now.

330
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:06,566
<i>Time for stars... now.</i>

331
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:11,637
<i>Okay, then let's move on.</i>

332
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:17,211
I will start eating
my second plate of chicken.

333
00:18:17,211 --> 00:18:20,622
<i>Wait. Why are you throwing that away?</i>

334
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:22,453
<i>Ah...</i>

335
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:24,263
<i>Do you mean this?</i>

336
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:29,603
<i>These are the bones remaining from
the first plate of chicken I had.</i>

337
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:31,026
<i>Eat the bones too.</i>

338
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,338
<i>I'll give you 100 stars if you do.</i>

339
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:40,255
100 stars if I eat the bones?

340
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:46,858
Hey, I'm broadcasting.

341
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,398
Why are you thinking about it?

342
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:52,103
- You're really going to eat them?
- Of course!

343
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:54,755
100 stars is 10,000 won.

344
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:57,019
Still, how can a person
eat chicken bones?

345
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,384
I have to pay off my credit card.

346
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:03,234
In order to not have credit issues,
I would eat feathers too, not just bones.

347
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:04,621
You could die.

348
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,324
Let go.

349
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:09,164
<i>Nouveau Riche, you waited a long time.</i>

350
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:11,192
<i>This hairy person kept bugging me.</i>

351
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,096
So, BJ Joon...

352
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:17,626
<i>will begin eating the bones.</i>

353
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:20,295
Oh, the smell of
the calcium and magnesium.

354
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:21,556
I'm getting healthier.

355
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:23,827
This is good. Okay, now.

356
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,431
Wow. This guy really
ate the chicken bone.

357
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,892
How can he eat chicken bones?

358
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:45,122
Isn't he embarrassed as an adult?

359
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:49,392
Hey, we'd better study hard
so we don't end up like that.

360
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:52,786
<i>Here. Ah, ah...</i>

361
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:55,198
I swallowed it. I ate it.

362
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:59,601
<i>Nouveau Riche, I want my stars.</i>

363
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:02,594
Okay, you got it.

364
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,265
<i>100 stars!</i>

365
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:10,102
<i>Thank you, Nouveau Riche.</i>

366
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:13,704
Sir! Nouveau Riche, sir. Thank you!

367
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:17,369
<i>Thank you! 100.</i>

368
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:33,101
He'll cause trouble doing that.

369
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:36,971
What are you doing here, Yoon Ah?

370
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:39,842
Oh, I was...

371
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:45,385
What? Dong Gu's still angry?

372
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:47,200
Did you do what I taught you?

373
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,865
No, I haven't sent it yet.

374
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,634
Why? It'll fix it.

375
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:53,471
I've never seen that
not work on anyone before.

376
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:54,762
Really?

377
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,771
- Okay, then I'll send it.
- Okay.

378
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:03,057
I couldn't even eat because of Yoon Ah.

379
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:04,251
What is this?

380
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:05,609
Geez.

381
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:08,830
Oh, it's Yoon Ah.

382
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,929
What is this?

383
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:11,689
<i>Do you want forgiveness that much?</i>

384
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,137
<i>Yes.</i>

385
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:14,451
<i>Say, "Forgive me."</i>

386
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,159
<i>Dong Gu, please forgive me.</i>

387
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,232
<i>Be cute.</i>

388
00:21:18,232 --> 00:21:19,983
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

389
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:21,171
<i>Be lovely.</i>

390
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:22,857
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

391
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:23,894
<i>Be charming,</i>

392
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:25,941
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

393
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:27,180
<i>Be tough.</i>

394
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,971
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

395
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:35,191
What? Is he mad? What does that mean?

396
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:43,137
What is this in
the middle of my broadcast?

397
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:44,343
Are you eating ramen?

398
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:46,535
Did you make it for yourself?

399
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:49,624
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Those are my pills.

400
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:52,394
They're for my bad heart!

401
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,074
- Hey!
- What's going on?

402
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:56,010
I think Dong Gu's still mad.

403
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,944
Let's give up.

404
00:21:57,944 --> 00:22:01,334
You are no good at acting cute.
You are terrible at it.

405
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:05,556
Am I that bad at it?

406
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:12,183
Cute, cute. She's so cute.

407
00:22:12,183 --> 00:22:13,734
Is she a person or a doll?

408
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,575
Good thing I had
these pills for my heart.

409
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:19,021
I nearly died from a heart attack.

410
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:20,656
Kang Dong Gu.

411
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:22,490
Why have you been
acting weird since yesterday?

412
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,930
Say it if you have something to say.

413
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,145
I have nothing to say.

414
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:31,997
Why is he acting like that?

415
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:34,804
Wait.

416
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:38,267
Is it possible...

417
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:40,671
that he still likes me?

418
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:45,049
The highlight of today's fan meeting,
the free prize, will start.

419
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:49,030
First, I'd like to show you
what we have for you.

420
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,590
Today's prize is from Cherry's debut film

421
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,201
"Bikini Investigators 3."

422
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:58,537
It is the very bikini that Cherry wore.

423
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:07,512
Please calm down everyone.

424
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:12,095
Please hold on to the numbered ticket
you all received when you came in.

425
00:23:12,095 --> 00:23:15,623
Cherry will now select a number.

426
00:23:16,673 --> 00:23:20,182
- Pick me!
- Me, me!

427
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:23,318
- Number 9!
- 89!

428
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:33,859
The lucky person who will
receive Cherry's bikini is...

429
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,567
number 38!

430
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,423
Is number 38 here?

431
00:23:41,423 --> 00:23:43,574
- What is it?
- He's not here.

432
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:45,849
Is number 38 not here?

433
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:49,325
- He's not here.
- Not here!

434
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:54,603
- Do it again.
- Do it again.

435
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:56,500
Do it again!

436
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,520
Again, again, again, again!

437
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,691
Oh, number 38!

438
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,644
Number 38 is here. Here he is!

439
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,407
Oh, there he is.

440
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:09,010
- Please come on up.
- Number 38!

441
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,159
- Three-eight, three-eight, three-eight!
- Congrats.

442
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,375
Please give him a round of applause.

443
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,607
<i>[Congratulations on winning the bikini.]</i>

444
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:31,051
Hello, everyone.

445
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:37,220
Why don't we start BJ Joon's program
of eating all kinds of bones?

446
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,440
I've prepared all kinds
of different bones.

447
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,259
<i>Let's go in order.</i>

448
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:45,686
<i>First, the chicken bone.</i>

449
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,565
<i>Then we have the pork backbone.</i>

450
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:51,880
<i>The back rib bone.</i>

451
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,155
<i>Rockfish bones.</i>

452
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:56,845
<i>Hairtail fish bones.</i>

453
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:58,576
<i>That's what I have prepared.</i>

454
00:24:58,576 --> 00:25:01,011
<i>Today's highlight...</i>

455
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:07,107
Pork feet bones.

456
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:08,768
That is the highlight today.

457
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:12,665
First, this is known
to be chewy and sharp.

458
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:16,057
<i>I will start with
the rockfish bones first.</i>

459
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,324
Let's start!

460
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:24,444
He is insane.

461
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:26,094
That guy...

462
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,589
Dong Gu, Dong Gu!

463
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,698
Give it to me. I'll do it.

464
00:25:57,698 --> 00:26:00,449
I'll do it. Why don't you go inside?

465
00:26:00,449 --> 00:26:02,469
I can do it.

466
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:07,384
Dong Gu, are you still
very angry with me?

467
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:10,955
I said I'm not angry at you.
Why do you keep asking that?

468
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:14,849
Then why are you acting this way?
Tell me, okay?

469
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:21,054
See. You can't tell me.

470
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:23,566
You are mad at me about the camera.

471
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:27,125
Fine, I am mad at you about the camera.

472
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:30,999
I'm not angry anymore though,
so don't worry about it.

473
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:33,305
- Okay?
- Really?

474
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,308
What a relief.

475
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:38,768
I was so worried about that for days.

476
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:42,020
Dong Gu, I won't ever
make a mistake ever again.

477
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,726
- Geez.
- I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

478
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:53,372
I have a cold.

479
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:56,183
It's fine. I'm okay.

480
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,608
Why do you always wear such thin coats?

481
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,627
That's why you get colds.

482
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:03,157
This is my warmest coat.

483
00:27:03,157 --> 00:27:05,669
It's actually pretty warm.

484
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:08,654
Oh yeah. I left the stove on.

485
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:10,011
I'm going to head in first.

486
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:12,196
Oh, geez.

487
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:28,021
<i>Nouveau Riche, thanks for the stars.</i>

488
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:32,365
<i>Venus, thank you for the stars.</i>

489
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:35,895
<i>All of this just for the rockfish bones.</i>

490
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:39,185
<i>BJ Joon doesn't know what to say.</i>

491
00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:41,744
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

492
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:46,051
Now with the strength of these stars...

493
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:48,469
the strongest of the bones.

494
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:54,102
I will try eating the pork feet bones.

495
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,608
<i>Joon is fine. I am fine.</i>

496
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:10,294
<i>Okay, I will eat it now.</i>

497
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:13,380
Oh, my stomach.

498
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,118
Joon will go on. Joon is fine!

499
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,619
What am I going to do? Ow!

500
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:32,468
Why did I have to win that?

501
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:35,227
I can't even throw it away.

502
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:41,630
Sorry. You waited too long, right?

503
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,049
No, it's okay.

504
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,542
It's cold, right? Drink this.

505
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:48,826
Thank you.

506
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:57,667
It was a little embarrassing
today, wasn't it?

507
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:00,776
Sorry, that's how my life is.

508
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:03,125
Don't talk like that.

509
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:08,155
Honestly, I didn't intend
to work in this business.

510
00:29:08,155 --> 00:29:12,865
I did TV dramas
and other films, at first.

511
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:16,266
Things weren't working out
and I needed the money.

512
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:20,277
I decided to try it just once
and I ended up here.

513
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:21,986
What's wrong with erotic films?

514
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:24,904
Still, this wasn't my dream.

515
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:29,640
I want to be in dramas
and films like before.

516
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:35,414
But my image is set in stone now,
so I don't get other offers.

517
00:29:35,414 --> 00:29:37,696
You can quit now if you want.

518
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:42,519
No, I can't do anything
because of contract issues.

519
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:47,711
I really don't know
what to do anymore either.

520
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:55,463
Sorry, I don't know why I cry
so much lately like a fool.

521
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:56,537
Oh yeah.

522
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:58,828
Didn't you say you had
something to tell me?

523
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:03,121
Oh, it's nothing.
I'll tell you next time.

524
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:04,757
Drink that.

525
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,580
I bought this,
but how do I give this to her?

526
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:19,884
Here, I bought this.
No, no, no!

527
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,106
I found it somewhere.

528
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:23,907
No, that's too obvious.

529
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:27,769
What was I planning when I bought this?

530
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:31,611
What if she figures out that I
like her once I give it to her?

531
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:35,417
We're here.

532
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,680
Be careful.

533
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,317
What's wrong, Joon Ki? What happened?

534
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:44,945
Well, Joon Ki was sick.
We went to the ER.

535
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:47,106
The ER? What was wrong with him?

536
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,376
Don't tell her.

537
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:51,795
Well... he ate the bones of a rockfish.

538
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,763
What? Rockfish bones?

539
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:56,371
Don't tell me you ate bones again.

540
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:57,882
No...

541
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:03,196
I'll go on up first
and clean up the room.

542
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:07,559
Why did I even buy this?
You dummy.

543
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,329
Oh!

544
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:12,076
- You were home, Dong Gu?
- What?

545
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:13,846
- Yes, I was.
- Oh.

546
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:15,670
What are you hiding there?

547
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,289
Ah, it's just...

548
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:24,365
Yoon Ah, here.

549
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:26,319
Gosh, you're heavy.

550
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,508
- What are you doing?
- Why are you all in here?

551
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:31,656
What's that?
Did you get that for Yoon Ah?

552
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:33,913
Uh, no.

553
00:31:33,913 --> 00:31:37,740
I was asking her to give it to Su Ah,
but I'll give it to her myself... Su Ah.

554
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:41,611
What is it?

555
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:46,153
A coat? What's with the coat, suddenly?

556
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,765
Because it was pretty.

557
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:50,795
Guys, I'm sick right now.

558
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:54,119
Can you put me in bed
before discussing the coat?

559
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,103
Sorry. Come on, Joon Ki.

560
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:59,733
Gosh, why are you so heavy?

561
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:02,464
I didn't even turn off
the broadcast before leaving.

562
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,343
Hold on.

563
00:32:04,343 --> 00:32:06,664
Let me take a look.

564
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:08,463
Seriously.

565
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,577
<i>- He's back.
- He must've gone to the hospital.</i>

566
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:12,896
- <i>There's the mustache girl.</i>
- What is all of this?

567
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:14,773
Why are you so shocked?

568
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:18,118
Hey, look at this. Look, look!

569
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:19,597
What is it?

570
00:32:19,597 --> 00:32:21,493
Why are there so many people?

571
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:24,558
What? 23,400 stars?

572
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,954
Each star is worth 100 won.

573
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:30,161
You have more than two million won.

574
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:33,361
I didn't even have 200 when I left.

575
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:35,221
What happened?

576
00:32:37,608 --> 00:32:39,606
- Seo Jin.
- Hm?

577
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:41,468
- Isn't this you?
- What?

578
00:32:41,468 --> 00:32:43,267
Why am I there?

579
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:46,183
Where is that razor?

580
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:50,839
<i>Here it is.</i>

581
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:52,601
<i>Is that woman shaving?</i>

582
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:53,760
<i>Is that mustache for real?</i>

583
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,126
<i>Today's broadcast is legendary.</i>

584
00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:56,737
<i>This is very clever.</i>

585
00:32:56,737 --> 00:33:00,073
<i>Started out as eating
and now it's a shaving show?</i>

586
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:02,221
What is this?

587
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:05,634
So, my shaving was aired live?

588
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:07,053
Thank you, Chewbacca.

589
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,063
I can solve my credit card issues,
thanks to you.

590
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:11,702
Is that the issue here, you idiot?

591
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:14,585
The whole country saw me shaving my face.

592
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:18,241
Hey, what are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

593
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:20,391
I didn't do it on purpose.

594
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:22,442
Who told you to shave here?

595
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:25,868
Oh, looks like someone's
coming into the room.

596
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:30,769
<i>I bought this,
but how do I give this to her?</i>

597
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:33,076
<i>Here, I bought this.
No, no, no!</i>

598
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,296
<i>I found it somewhere.</i>

599
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:38,021
<i>No, that's too obvious.</i>

600
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:41,959
<i>What if she figures out that
I like her once I give it to her?</i>

601
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,512
Huh?

602
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:46,942
What? What is it?

603
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:51,133
Give that to me.

604
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:58,257
Wait. What were you saying there?

605
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:00,740
"Figures out you like her"?

606
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,611
Well, uh...

607
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:03,828
Dong Gu, it can't be...

608
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:05,128
It's not like that.

609
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,030
You don't like Su Ah again, do you?

610
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,447
Huh?

611
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,237
No, it's not like that.

612
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:12,737
What do you mean?
The evidence is right there.

613
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:14,588
No, it's not that.

614
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:17,811
Dong Gu, let's talk for a bit.

615
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:21,393
Huh?

616
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,664
Sure.

617
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:34,889
Gosh, that fool.

618
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:40,304
You know that we're over.

619
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:41,445
Huh?

620
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:44,443
I know. I know very well.

621
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:46,213
- But...
- Then why do this if you know?

622
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:48,713
Dong Gu, is it that hard to forget me?

623
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:50,284
No, I can forget you.

624
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:52,340
I'll forget you.
I'll forget you right this moment.

625
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,358
I can forget you, Su Ah.
I can erase you, Su Ah.

626
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:57,503
So, don't worry about it. Bye now.

627
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:02,818
Dong Gu, what am I to do with you?

628
00:35:09,784 --> 00:35:11,954
It is pretty, though.

629
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:22,396
What good is it if you like me?
You don't know my size.

630
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:25,927
Dong Gu, what am I to do with you?

631
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:29,137
Su Ah, what am I to do with you?
What am I to do?

632
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:31,777
Su Ah, is this why you moved in here?

633
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:33,327
You wanted to date my brother again?

634
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:36,306
No, I have a conscience, after all.

635
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:39,146
I can't bear to see
you two date ever again.

636
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:42,056
Do whatever you have to
in order to cut him off.

637
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,588
You got it?

638
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,367
Okay.

639
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:55,146
Su Ah.

640
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,826
Why did you want to meet me outside?

641
00:35:57,826 --> 00:36:02,559
Well, I thought about it long and hard.

642
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,510
I don't think I can accept your feelings.

643
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,625
That again?

644
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,992
I'm fine so don't worry about me.

645
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:12,045
How can I not worry?

646
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,434
You shouldn't have gotten caught, then.

647
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:16,974
So, I prepared something for you.

648
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,014
Prepared something? What?

649
00:36:19,014 --> 00:36:21,036
I'm setting you up on a date.

650
00:36:21,036 --> 00:36:23,938
What? A date?

651
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:27,318
So, you're setting me up
with someone now?

652
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,637
She's here. Ye Rin, over here.

653
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:32,954
Oh, hello. She's really here.

654
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,463
This is a junior of mine, Lee Ye Rin.
This is my friend, Kang Dong Gu.

655
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,628
Hello, I've heard a lot
about you from Su Ah.

656
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:45,320
Hello, I wonder what you heard about me.

657
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,451
Dong Gu, do well.

658
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:50,030
- With what?
- I'm going to leave now.

659
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,186
Su Ah, where are you going?

660
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:53,869
Su Ah.

661
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:56,103
She's just leaving.

662
00:36:57,246 --> 00:36:59,128
Yes, uh...

663
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:08,186
<i>[For the Sake of Love]</i>

664
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:10,356
<i>I'm home.</i>

665
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:11,684
- You're home?
- Oh?

666
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:14,003
Why are you home so early?
What about Ye Rin?

667
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:17,164
Oh, we just ended
the date a little early.

668
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:19,652
So, did the date go well?

669
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:22,193
- Did you ask her for a second date?
- What?

670
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,570
No.

671
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,210
Why? I saw her picture
and she's just your type.

672
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:33,744
Well, her looks are my type.

673
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:36,625
How should I put it?
I like girls who are intelligent.

674
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,094
Ye Rin is very intelligent.

675
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:39,945
She graduated with
a business degree from Seoul University

676
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:41,077
and studied abroad at Harvard.

677
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,994
Her IQ is high too,
so she's a Mensa member.

678
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,496
Yeah? It's good to
be pretty and intelligent.

679
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,590
I don't like it when girls
don't have a sense of humor.

680
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,889
Ye Rin is a comedian.

681
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:54,081
She became a comedian at JBC
in 2017 and she's hilarious.

682
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:55,630
Really?

683
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,440
Oh, but how should I put it?

684
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,931
I don't get that feeling of,
"She's the one."

685
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:04,864
Be quiet! This is because
of Su Ah, isn't it?

686
00:38:04,864 --> 00:38:06,351
You still have feelings for her.

687
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,157
No, I told you it's not like that.

688
00:38:08,157 --> 00:38:09,958
Then why didn't you ask her out again?

689
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:10,972
Why not?

690
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,561
- Well...
- Dong Gu.

691
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:15,918
Why are you doing this?
Why are you making things so hard for me?

692
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,005
I told you it's not like that.

693
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:28,989
Fine, I'll do it! I'll ask her out again.

694
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:31,092
Do it right now while we're watching.

695
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:32,411
What?

696
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:37,139
Gosh, fine. I'll do it.

697
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:39,353
I can do it, okay?

698
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:41,063
I'm doing it.

699
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:44,882
<i>I asked her to help clean.
What is Su Ah doing?</i>

700
00:38:44,882 --> 00:38:47,172
Why aren't you coming down, Su Ah?

701
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:52,242
I was going to throw out
some clothes I don't wear.

702
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:55,213
You've made more of a mess.

703
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:58,108
Oh, this is the coat Dong Gu bought you.

704
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:00,626
Yeah, but it's too small.

705
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:03,048
I can't throw it out though.

706
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:04,817
You want to wear it?

707
00:39:04,817 --> 00:39:06,197
Really?

708
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:09,144
All right. Let me try.

709
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:10,992
I'll wear it.

710
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:14,766
What? It's too small for me too.

711
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:17,342
Do you want to try it on?

712
00:39:17,342 --> 00:39:19,237
Me? No, thanks.

713
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:22,277
Don't be like that
and try it on. Just once.

714
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,103
Here.

715
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:29,742
Oh, look at that. Fits you perfectly.

716
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,215
Yeah. Do you want to wear it, Yoon Ah?

717
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:35,079
How can I do that when
Dong Gu bought it for you?

718
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,152
It's okay.

719
00:39:36,152 --> 00:39:39,302
You think so? Oh, whatever.

720
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:43,097
Why do you have so many clothes
when you have nothing else?

721
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:46,813
Oh, isn't that Mouramouge?

722
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:54,844
It is. It's Mouramouge.

723
00:39:54,844 --> 00:39:57,146
Mouramouge? What's that?

724
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:58,476
You don't know it?

725
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:00,155
It's a designer label.

726
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:04,373
This 2017 Fall/Winter
vintage collection was worn by

727
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,440
Song Hye Gyo, Jeon Ji Hyun,
Kim Tae Hee, and so on.

728
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,150
All celebrities wore this collection
and it was a big hit.

729
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,335
Why don't you wear this?

730
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:14,764
I just don't really wear it.

731
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:16,414
Do you want it?

732
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,153
Really? Thank you, Su Ah.

733
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:20,324
Thank you so much.

734
00:40:20,324 --> 00:40:22,766
Su Ah, don't clean today and just rest.

735
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:26,420
I'll do all of it.
I love you, Su Ah.

736
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:31,172
I'm taking all of it.

737
00:40:31,172 --> 00:40:32,215
Okay.

738
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:34,094
So nice.

739
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,244
Why are you doing this, Director?

740
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:41,788
What?

741
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:46,443
Why would you put in scenes that aren't
in the script without talking to me?

742
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:49,414
Hey, turn on the lights.

743
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,014
Is this your first time filming?

744
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:53,275
Why are you being
so sensitive over nothing?

745
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:55,931
I can't do this film
if you're going to work like this.

746
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,021
Are you refusing to film?

747
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,190
- Then pay for breach of contract.
- What?

748
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,268
If you don't have the money for that,
stop talking and just work.

749
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:04,858
What will it be? Will you do it or not?

750
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:09,356
- I'm going to get some air.
- Seriously.

751
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:25,570
Get up.

752
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,389
- Doo Shik.
- Get up now.

753
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:29,849
What is it?

754
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:33,586
Where are we going?
Doo Shik, what are you doing?

755
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:37,876
You said you don't want to do this work.

756
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:39,157
Then don't do it.

757
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:41,061
Don't force yourself to do it.

758
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:43,539
Live your life doing what you want.

759
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:45,039
How can I do that?

760
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,684
I have the contract with the agency.

761
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:50,210
I'll take care of it,
so just go home for now.

762
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,202
I'll resolve everything and call you.

763
00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:58,556
Doo Shik!

764
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:07,326
Writer Bong, what did you just say?

765
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:10,547
What? Cherry can't shoot the film?

766
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:14,847
That's right.
So, don't look for Cherry...

767
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:16,902
I mean, don't contact Mal Geum anymore.

768
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:19,737
Who decided that?

769
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,847
Then will you pay for the breach of
contract in the movie appearance?

770
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,932
As well as her breach of contract
with our management company?

771
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:28,293
Yes, I will pay you.

772
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:30,010
How much is it?

773
00:42:34,782 --> 00:42:37,960
It's 40 million won,
40 million, 40 million.

774
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,114
What do I do? I'm crazy. I'm insane.

775
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:46,320
Ta-da.

776
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,231
Joon Ki, how do I look?

777
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:52,335
Wow, you look a bum
dressed in warm clothes.

778
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:55,375
Are you giving up on a job
and doing that now?

779
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:58,181
A bum? This is all designer.

780
00:42:58,181 --> 00:43:01,135
Mouramouge F/W 2017 vintage collection.

781
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:02,836
What? Mour... what?

782
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:05,012
Forget it. You don't know fashion.

783
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:06,987
Never mind. I'm going to the library.

784
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:09,101
Dress warm.

785
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:10,739
- You're home?
- Yes.

786
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:13,137
What are those warm looking bum clothes?

787
00:43:13,137 --> 00:43:15,199
Why do you have an onion bag?

788
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,733
It's not an onion bag!

789
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:20,952
- This is the Mouramouge 2017--
- Mour... what?

790
00:43:20,952 --> 00:43:22,208
Never mind.

791
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,960
I can't talk to you two.

792
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,048
You don't know anything about fashion.

793
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:27,858
What is that thing then?

794
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:29,949
Where did she find those bum clothes?

795
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:32,528
All we need is a trash can
and she'd look just right.

796
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:33,972
Yeah. Oh, Joon Ki.

797
00:43:33,972 --> 00:43:37,423
That bum isn't important.
I'm in big trouble.

798
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:40,043
Trouble? What trouble?

799
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:43,393
What? You have to pay
for Mal Geum's breach of contract?

800
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:46,704
Yeah, I just felt so bad for Mal Geum.

801
00:43:46,704 --> 00:43:49,445
Even if you feel bad for her,
why would you do that?

802
00:43:49,445 --> 00:43:51,527
I didn't know it would be that much.

803
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:53,684
What should I do?
Should I try to get a loan?

804
00:43:53,684 --> 00:43:55,365
You think anyone can get a loan?

805
00:43:55,365 --> 00:43:57,538
An unemployed guy
like you can't get a loan.

806
00:43:57,538 --> 00:44:00,681
Then what do I do?
I'm going crazy.

807
00:44:02,905 --> 00:44:05,177
There is an option.

808
00:44:05,177 --> 00:44:09,427
Hm, there's a way? What is it?

809
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,059
<i>The race has started.</i>

810
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:13,293
<i>You must place your bets...</i>

811
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:22,181
It's the same here as always.

812
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:25,202
What? Isn't this place
for cycling or something?

813
00:44:25,202 --> 00:44:26,474
Isn't this illegal?

814
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:27,742
Not at all.

815
00:44:27,742 --> 00:44:29,943
They have a permit and everything.

816
00:44:29,943 --> 00:44:34,443
Also, this is the only place
you can get big money quickly.

817
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:37,695
But what guarantee do we have
that we will win?

818
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:40,184
There is a way.

819
00:44:40,184 --> 00:44:43,023
Have you heard of the cycling god?

820
00:44:43,023 --> 00:44:44,101
Cycling god?

821
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:50,143
He can guess who will win,
so they call him cycling god.

822
00:44:50,702 --> 00:44:54,601
Where is he today?

823
00:44:57,838 --> 00:44:59,474
Over there.

824
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:01,913
That is the cycling god.

825
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:06,003
You just need to choose who he does.

826
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,862
Then you will win.
That's what they say.

827
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:12,032
Whoever that man is,
how will we know who he picked?

828
00:45:12,032 --> 00:45:14,219
There is a way. Follow me.

829
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:15,414
- Huh?
- Follow me.

830
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:18,827
- What are we doing?
- Just stand there.

831
00:45:18,827 --> 00:45:20,498
Stand where?

832
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,909
Get lost!

833
00:45:24,827 --> 00:45:27,673
Hey, what are you doing?

834
00:45:27,673 --> 00:45:30,454
I'm sorry. My friend is drunk.

835
00:45:30,454 --> 00:45:33,775
Why would you show up after drinking?

836
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,103
Here you go.

837
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,527
So sorry.

838
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:41,719
Why did you suddenly push me?

839
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:44,208
I saw it. I saw who
the cycling god picked.

840
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,141
Really? Who?

841
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:53,079
Take this and make your bet.

842
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,010
- I have to go to the bathroom?
- Why?

843
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:58,275
I haven't been well
since I ate the rockfish bones.

844
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:00,335
I'll be right back. Bet everything, okay.

845
00:46:00,335 --> 00:46:01,972
Hurry back.

846
00:46:07,322 --> 00:46:10,182
Dong Gu, are you going on your date?

847
00:46:10,182 --> 00:46:11,766
Yes.

848
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:15,389
Have a nice time.
Buy Ye Rin lots of yummy food.

849
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,021
Su Ah, can't I just not go on the date?

850
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:30,367
Why? Is it because of me again?

851
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:31,789
It's not that.

852
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,760
I don't have money
because we don't have guests.

853
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,358
Dates cost quite a lot.

854
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,987
Isn't it kind of hard to be
dating in this situation?

855
00:46:38,987 --> 00:46:42,177
- I think--
- Dong Gu, I'm here.

856
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:46,730
Ye Rin! What are you doing here?

857
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,119
It costs a lot of money
to go out on dates.

858
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,478
I thought we should cook at home
and have a date like that.

859
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:54,577
I'll quickly cook something good.

860
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:55,807
Where is the kitchen?

861
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:57,456
Oh no. You shouldn't.

862
00:46:57,456 --> 00:47:00,262
Over here. Follow me.

863
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:05,822
You see?

864
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,851
She's such a thoughtful person.

865
00:47:07,851 --> 00:47:12,152
So, don't worry about money
and date comfortably, okay?

866
00:47:12,152 --> 00:47:13,891
Okay.

867
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:16,773
How can she be so thoughtful?

868
00:47:16,773 --> 00:47:18,998
She is so deep.

869
00:47:24,748 --> 00:47:26,512
What took you so long?
The race started.

870
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:29,222
Sorry. I'm just not feeling very well.

871
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,733
You made your bet, right?

872
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:33,382
Here. How do we look at this?

873
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:35,597
You just go from top to bottom.

874
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,708
Huh? Hey, man!

875
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:42,467
I told you to pick one and nine.
Why did you pick one and six?

876
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:46,809
- What? You wrote here six and one.
- Huh?

877
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:49,829
You turned it upside down!

878
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:53,385
You're supposed to
read it like this, you idiot!

879
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:54,813
You should've said so in words.

880
00:47:54,813 --> 00:47:56,884
We're ruined because of you.

881
00:47:56,884 --> 00:47:58,646
Gosh, I'm going to lose it.

882
00:47:58,646 --> 00:48:00,722
Then what do I do now?

883
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:03,822
This can't happen.

884
00:48:03,822 --> 00:48:06,139
<i>This is the final lap.</i>

885
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:08,574
<i>They are going faster now.</i>

886
00:48:08,574 --> 00:48:10,021
<i>Final lap.</i>

887
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:13,456
<i>There is a pursuit for first
in the final moments.</i>

888
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:15,726
<i>Six is moving up.</i>

889
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,619
<i>One and six, one and six.
It's number six!</i>

890
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:20,369
Awesome!

891
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:23,038
Yeah!

892
00:48:23,038 --> 00:48:24,737
What happened?

893
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:27,237
Hey, the riders you picked won.

894
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,347
- We won!
- Really?

895
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:32,300
- Then we won?
- Yes.

896
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:35,833
Wow.

897
00:48:40,759 --> 00:48:42,784
Wow, how much is this?

898
00:48:42,784 --> 00:48:45,534
I think I can cover
what I need with this.

899
00:48:45,534 --> 00:48:47,106
Should we go, then?

900
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:50,523
Wait, Doo Shik.
Doesn't it feel wrong to leave like this?

901
00:48:50,523 --> 00:48:53,211
You earned that by
betting only 48,000 won.

902
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:55,413
You already made this much.

903
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:58,074
If you had bet all of this,
how much would it be?

904
00:48:58,074 --> 00:48:59,949
It would be a huge amount.
Why do you ask?

905
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:01,347
Why do you think?

906
00:49:01,347 --> 00:49:03,905
If we win one more time,
Mal Geum's money is no problem.

907
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:06,036
And our long-time wish...

908
00:49:06,036 --> 00:49:08,115
We could even make a movie.

909
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:12,454
Doo Shik, let's do it! Let's go for it!

910
00:49:13,306 --> 00:49:14,934
Our movie?

911
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:20,851
Ye Rin, you're a really good cook.

912
00:49:20,851 --> 00:49:22,706
Right, Dong Gu?

913
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:23,869
I guess so.

914
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:26,335
Would you like some kimbap?
I'll feed it to you.

915
00:49:26,335 --> 00:49:29,438
- Ah...
- No, it's okay. I'll eat it.

916
00:49:29,438 --> 00:49:31,391
I want to feed you.

917
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,485
"Ah."

918
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:34,302
I said it's okay.

919
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:38,797
I'm sorry. I just wanted to feed you.

920
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,911
Come see me for a moment.

921
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:46,641
Why? We're in the middle of eating.

922
00:49:46,641 --> 00:49:48,240
Why?

923
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,023
Kang Dong Gu, what's the matter with you?

924
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:53,072
What did I do?

925
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:55,601
Why won't you say "ah" when Ye Rin
wants to feed you kimbap?

926
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:57,563
Why won't you say "ah"?

927
00:49:57,563 --> 00:50:00,065
I just want to eat it myself.

928
00:50:00,065 --> 00:50:02,695
Don't lie. You're doing that
because of me.

929
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:05,541
You're thinking about me
and that's why you won't say "ah."

930
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:07,525
No, that's not what it is.

931
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:09,452
Then why won't you say "ah"?

932
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:12,574
Why won't you say "ah"
when she's giving you good food?

933
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:14,454
Okay. I'll say "ah."

934
00:50:14,454 --> 00:50:17,282
I'll say "ah," okay?

935
00:50:17,282 --> 00:50:22,556
Ah...

936
00:50:24,603 --> 00:50:26,202
How is it? Is it good?

937
00:50:26,202 --> 00:50:29,150
Yes, it's very good.

938
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:31,824
One more since you like it.

939
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:34,798
I just ate one though.

940
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,559
Ah...

941
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:45,824
Oh my goodness.

942
00:50:55,074 --> 00:50:58,619
No one can take their eyes off me.

943
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,771
Everyone has such great taste.

944
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:06,099
It is Mouramouge, after all.

945
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:08,496
Mouramouge.

946
00:51:08,496 --> 00:51:10,878
Oh, spicy rice cakes.

947
00:51:13,134 --> 00:51:14,498
Looks good.

948
00:51:14,498 --> 00:51:17,775
Mister, one serving of spicy rice cakes.

949
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:20,873
You do have money, right?

950
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:22,947
Yes, why do you ask?

951
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:26,255
You have to pay before eating here.

952
00:51:26,255 --> 00:51:29,528
Ah, I see.

953
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:34,597
- Ma'am, please give me some onions.
- Which ones?

954
00:51:34,597 --> 00:51:36,842
- These here.
- Okay.

955
00:51:36,842 --> 00:51:40,108
Oh no. I'm out of bags.

956
00:51:40,108 --> 00:51:42,617
Oh, there's an onion bag here.

957
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:43,657
I'll put it in here.

958
00:51:43,657 --> 00:51:45,713
- Okay.
- This is great.

959
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:51,603
My bag.

960
00:51:51,603 --> 00:51:53,054
Where did it go?

961
00:51:54,092 --> 00:51:55,427
Where is it?

962
00:51:55,427 --> 00:51:58,836
- How is this one?
- Ma'am, what are you doing?

963
00:51:58,836 --> 00:52:00,387
- What?
- Well.

964
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:02,603
Why are you putting onions in my bag?

965
00:52:02,603 --> 00:52:04,695
This is your bag?
I thought it was an onion bag.

966
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:06,222
It's not for onions!

967
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:10,974
This is Mouramouge Fall/Winter
2017 vintage collection.

968
00:52:10,974 --> 00:52:13,315
Forget it. Just move.

969
00:52:13,315 --> 00:52:15,416
Wait a minute.

970
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,005
It smells like onions.

971
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:20,081
I'm sorry.

972
00:52:20,081 --> 00:52:21,364
This is my bag.

973
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:23,246
I really didn't know.

974
00:52:29,528 --> 00:52:30,914
Yes, Hae Won.

975
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:34,155
What? You want to set me up?

976
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:36,755
Why would I do that
when I'm still looking for a job?

977
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:39,547
What? He looks like Daniel Kang?

978
00:52:39,547 --> 00:52:42,503
Gosh. Where are you?

979
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:50,458
Hae Won, I'm here.

980
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:54,179
Oh, Seo Jin... you're here?

981
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,844
Sorry, I'm a little late.

982
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,547
Seo Jin, what's that smell?

983
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,070
It smells like onions.

984
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:09,023
Sorry, I had an
absurd thing happen to me.

985
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:13,293
I'm sorry.

986
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:16,032
No, it's okay.

987
00:53:16,853 --> 00:53:19,561
I'm Kang Seo Jin.

988
00:53:20,215 --> 00:53:22,547
Was the food to your liking, Dong Gu?

989
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:24,686
Yes, it was very good.

990
00:53:24,686 --> 00:53:26,454
Would you like some gum?

991
00:53:28,722 --> 00:53:29,815
Ah.

992
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:32,762
Oh, I'll just take it.

993
00:53:35,135 --> 00:53:37,947
Ah...

994
00:53:40,235 --> 00:53:41,775
What? Are you in pain?

995
00:53:41,775 --> 00:53:44,617
I've been stressed out
and now my neck hurts.

996
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:48,259
A foot massage is the best for stress.
Would you like a foot massage?

997
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:49,628
- What?
- Give me your feet.

998
00:53:49,628 --> 00:53:51,570
Oh no!

999
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,242
A foot massage? It's fine.

1000
00:53:54,242 --> 00:53:58,420
Sorry, I just wanted help
relieve your stress.

1001
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,081
It's okay. No need for a foot massage.

1002
00:54:02,081 --> 00:54:05,175
Dong Gu, come see me for a moment.

1003
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:08,112
Why?

1004
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:11,992
Why are you being this way?

1005
00:54:11,992 --> 00:54:13,255
What did I do now?

1006
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:14,746
Why won't you do the foot massage?

1007
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:17,505
Ye Rin wants to do it,
so why won't you let her?

1008
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:21,295
What? I met her yesterday.
Why would I get a foot massage from her?

1009
00:54:21,295 --> 00:54:23,846
Look at you again.
Did you think I wouldn't know?

1010
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:26,302
You're not getting it because
you're thinking about me.

1011
00:54:26,302 --> 00:54:27,846
No.

1012
00:54:27,846 --> 00:54:29,956
It's really not because of you.

1013
00:54:29,956 --> 00:54:32,235
Then why won't you get the foot massage?

1014
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:36,755
Even a minute of it would relieve stress,
so why won't you get the foot massage?

1015
00:54:36,755 --> 00:54:38,516
- Why?
- Okay, I'll get it!

1016
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:40,793
I can get the foot massage!

1017
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:56,778
Hm, where did this guy go?

1018
00:54:56,778 --> 00:54:59,599
Did he go to the restroom?

1019
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:03,315
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1020
00:55:03,315 --> 00:55:06,735
Did the man sitting here go somewhere?

1021
00:55:06,735 --> 00:55:08,661
He just paid and left.

1022
00:55:08,661 --> 00:55:10,735
He left?

1023
00:55:10,735 --> 00:55:14,599
Where did he go
in the middle of a date?

1024
00:55:21,175 --> 00:55:23,356
Yeah, Hae Won.

1025
00:55:23,356 --> 00:55:27,927
Dae Young left without a word
while I was in the restroom.

1026
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:29,280
What's with him?

1027
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,083
<i>Why would you come out dressed
like that when I'm setting you up?</i>

1028
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:33,637
<i>And what's with that onion bag?</i>

1029
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:37,001
It's not an onion bag.
It's called a net bag.

1030
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:41,987
Also, this is all Mouramouge.
The designer of designers.

1031
00:55:41,987 --> 00:55:44,306
Ah...

1032
00:55:44,306 --> 00:55:48,507
So, Dae Young left because
of the way I was dressed?

1033
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:52,545
What do you mean that's not true?
Okay, I'm going to go.

1034
00:55:54,338 --> 00:55:56,063
How ridiculous.

1035
00:55:56,063 --> 00:55:58,876
These ignorant people
who know nothing about fashion.

1036
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:02,420
He doesn't even resemble
one pore of Daniel Kang's.

1037
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,829
<i>The star of tonight is me. It's me.</i>

1038
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,545
<i>It's me. It's me.</i>

1039
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:09,512
<i>Waiting for you...</i>

1040
00:56:09,512 --> 00:56:11,934
How can I not even win once?

1041
00:56:18,873 --> 00:56:20,215
Does this make sense?

1042
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:23,228
How can we be wrong every time?

1043
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:24,864
I don't know. I don't know.

1044
00:56:24,864 --> 00:56:28,355
I lost the money I won because of you.

1045
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:31,103
I said we should just go.

1046
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:33,217
What is this?

1047
00:56:35,755 --> 00:56:38,588
Doo Shik. I'm sorry, Doo Shik.

1048
00:56:38,588 --> 00:56:40,311
Hey, Doo Shik.

1049
00:56:40,311 --> 00:56:42,929
I'm sorry. Hey, Doo Shik!

1050
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:46,030
I'm sorry, okay?

1051
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,791
Doo Shik, I said I'm sorry.

1052
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:49,570
Forget it. What do I do now?

1053
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,648
We don't even have bus money.
How do we get home?

1054
00:56:51,648 --> 00:56:55,507
I'm going crazy too.
We can't walk all the way home.

1055
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:58,389
You even lost your bus money.

1056
00:56:58,389 --> 00:56:59,789
Hello.

1057
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:02,472
Greed will lead you nowhere.

1058
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:06,057
Take this.

1059
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,630
However, don't ever come back here again.

1060
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,650
Can you promise that?

1061
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:13,447
Of course, we won't come back.

1062
00:57:15,096 --> 00:57:16,730
Thank you. Thank you.

1063
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,579
All right. I'll be going.

1064
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:21,128
They won't ever be able to quit.

1065
00:57:21,128 --> 00:57:23,065
Thank you.

1066
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:25,161
What a relief.

1067
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:28,998
We can go home thanks
to the cycling god, right?

1068
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:32,197
The bus is here, Joon Ki. The bus!

1069
00:57:32,197 --> 00:57:33,661
Wait, Doo Shik.

1070
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:37,125
- What now?
- Isn't it wrong to leave now?

1071
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:39,829
Let's play one more round.

1072
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:42,576
Huh? With what money?

1073
00:57:42,576 --> 00:57:45,119
What? You mean with this?

1074
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,010
What are you going to tell Mal Geum?

1075
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,420
What will you do with Mal Geum,
who's trusting in you?

1076
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,947
If we have one big win

1077
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:53,485
you can help her
and we can make our film.

1078
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:55,498
If things go well...

1079
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:58,400
you could even marry Mal Geum.

1080
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,918
Doo Shik, let's go!

1081
00:58:00,918 --> 00:58:03,568
Let's go for it!

1082
00:58:03,568 --> 00:58:05,101
Marriage?

1083
00:58:09,623 --> 00:58:12,353
Yeah!

1084
00:58:16,641 --> 00:58:17,693
Seriously!

1085
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:21,358
I'm the crazy one for believing you.
I'm crazy. I'm a crazy punk.

1086
00:58:22,188 --> 00:58:24,269
I had a really good feeling this time.

1087
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:26,009
Shut up and just walk.

1088
00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:29,260
It's so cold.
It'll take forever to walk home.

1089
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,753
Doo Shik.

1090
00:58:33,402 --> 00:58:36,157
Look, it's 500 won.

1091
00:58:36,157 --> 00:58:38,338
What about the 500 won?
What about it?

1092
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:41,501
You want to bet on races with that?
Are you crazy?

1093
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:44,612
If we win big just once,
we can pay for Mal Geum and our film.

1094
00:58:44,612 --> 00:58:48,398
You can marry Mal Geum for sure
and your children...

1095
00:58:48,398 --> 00:58:50,793
will grow up with
silver spoons in their mouths.

1096
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:55,713
Doo Shik, let's go. Let's go for it!

1097
00:58:55,713 --> 00:58:57,353
Silver spoons?

1098
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,369
Yeah!

1099
00:59:05,362 --> 00:59:08,652
I'm the crazy one for going with you.
I must be insane.

1100
00:59:08,652 --> 00:59:10,969
Idiot, idiot.

1101
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:14,356
I really thought it would
work out this time.

1102
00:59:14,356 --> 00:59:17,291
Oh, Doo Shik.

1103
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:19,541
Look, it's a beer bottle.

1104
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,931
What about the beer bottle?
What do you want with that?

1105
00:59:21,931 --> 00:59:24,818
Hey, this is 130 won per bottle.

1106
00:59:24,818 --> 00:59:28,336
If we can gather a few more,
we can get some money.

1107
00:59:28,336 --> 00:59:29,971
Then we can hit it big with a bet.

1108
00:59:29,971 --> 00:59:33,340
Then Mal Geum's money, our film,
your marriage, your kids...

1109
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,829
What do you think, Doo Shik?

1110
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:37,989
Doo Shik, let's go for it!

1111
00:59:37,989 --> 00:59:39,447
You crazy...

1112
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:41,898
How can we do that with
an empty bottle, you crazy idiot?

1113
00:59:41,898 --> 00:59:43,695
We can pick up a few more.

1114
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:45,516
Be ambitious, Doo Shik.

1115
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:46,820
Let's go!

1116
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,987
Stop the nonsense and let's go home!

1117
00:59:48,987 --> 00:59:51,019
Follow me, you crazy idiot.

1118
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:52,699
- Hey, hey.
- Come on.

1119
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:55,768
We have an event today for White Day.

1120
00:59:55,768 --> 00:59:57,489
Come look at the prizes.

1121
00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:00,039
First place is a
return flight to Jeju Island.

1122
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:02,159
Come and try it out.

1123
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:03,539
Excuse me.

1124
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:04,572
Yes?

1125
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:06,619
May I try too?

1126
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:10,096
Ah, yes. Of course.

1127
01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:24,114
Oh, oh! I won the fourth place prize.

1128
01:00:24,114 --> 01:00:27,994
So, what did I win?

1129
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:31,492
- Here you go.
- Wow. So cool.

1130
01:00:31,492 --> 01:00:33,594
Awesome.

1131
01:00:33,594 --> 01:00:35,655
Thank you.

1132
01:00:39,514 --> 01:00:41,431
Thank you!

1133
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:07,474
This candy is really good.

1134
01:01:30,027 --> 01:01:32,695
We could've played one more game
if we'd sold the bottles.

1135
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:34,824
I saw five beer bottles on the way here.

1136
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:37,304
What kind of a man has no ambition?

1137
01:01:37,304 --> 01:01:40,724
Shut up. Shut up, man. I said shut up!

1138
01:01:40,724 --> 01:01:43,833
Oh, hey. Hey, hey.

1139
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,543
She looks very familiar.

1140
01:01:45,543 --> 01:01:47,342
What do you mean?

1141
01:01:47,342 --> 01:01:50,025
Who is that? Isn't that Seo Jin?

1142
01:01:50,025 --> 01:01:51,818
I think you're right.

1143
01:01:52,972 --> 01:01:54,514
You're right.

1144
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:56,126
Hey, Seo Jin.

1145
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:57,603
Get up, Kang Seo Jin.

1146
01:01:57,603 --> 01:01:59,842
What is it?

1147
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:02,280
You don't know anything about fashion.

1148
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,391
Oh, the alcohol.

1149
01:02:03,391 --> 01:02:07,126
Where did she drink so much
this early in the day?

1150
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:10,570
Look at her.
She even has a can.

1151
01:02:13,842 --> 01:02:16,813
- Doo Shik.
- What now?

1152
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:19,563
Look at this. It's money.

1153
01:02:19,563 --> 01:02:22,184
What? Why does she have
money in this can?

1154
01:02:22,184 --> 01:02:24,603
We can play one more round
before they close if we go now.

1155
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:26,530
- What do you think?
- What?

1156
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:29,342
You want to bet again with this?
Are you truly insane?

1157
01:02:29,342 --> 01:02:31,960
If the gods have a conscience,
they have to let us win.

1158
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,606
Doo Shik.

1159
01:02:33,606 --> 01:02:36,114
Let's go! Let's go for it!

1160
01:02:36,114 --> 01:02:39,932
Shut up! Stop saying crazy crap.

1161
01:02:40,655 --> 01:02:43,425
Yeah, let's give up.

1162
01:02:43,425 --> 01:02:47,007
Then you can't repay
Mal Geum's debts or get married.

1163
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:50,507
You can live your life having a crush
on her and then die a sad death.

1164
01:02:50,507 --> 01:02:52,280
Give up.

1165
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,425
That can't happen.

1166
01:02:53,425 --> 01:02:57,585
Doo Shik, let's try just one more time.

1167
01:02:57,585 --> 01:02:59,981
Doo Shik, let's go!

1168
01:02:59,981 --> 01:03:02,014
Let's go for it!

1169
01:03:02,014 --> 01:03:05,407
Okay, I can't die after
just having a crush on her.

1170
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,277
Let's go! Let's go for it!

1171
01:03:11,146 --> 01:03:13,869
Let's go, Doo Shik!

1172
01:03:20,782 --> 01:03:22,329
I'll get going then, Dong Gu.

1173
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:24,045
Get home safely, Ye Rin.

1174
01:03:24,045 --> 01:03:26,869
Dong Gu, I like you a lot.

1175
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:29,481
Do you want to officially date me?

1176
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:31,297
What?

1177
01:03:33,717 --> 01:03:36,829
The thing is, Ye Rin...

1178
01:03:36,829 --> 01:03:39,306
I want you to listen to me
without misunderstanding.

1179
01:03:39,306 --> 01:03:43,697
Ye Rin, you're pretty, intelligent,
and have a good sense of humor.

1180
01:03:43,697 --> 01:03:48,418
You're thoughtful, a good cook,
and you give good foot massages.

1181
01:03:48,418 --> 01:03:53,123
You're a perfect person
who even cleans well.

1182
01:03:53,123 --> 01:03:56,753
But, I wonder if I'm lacking for you.

1183
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:58,992
- Also--
- Wait.

1184
01:03:58,992 --> 01:04:00,733
I'm getting rejected, right?

1185
01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:02,623
- It's not that.
- Why?

1186
01:04:02,623 --> 01:04:05,483
Is there someone you like?

1187
01:04:05,483 --> 01:04:06,780
What?

1188
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,630
Well, uh...

1189
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:11,034
I guess I was right.

1190
01:04:11,034 --> 01:04:14,923
What do you mean by that?

1191
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:17,224
Do you mean me and Su Ah?

1192
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:20,978
Su Ah is just a friend.
She's totally a friend.

1193
01:04:20,978 --> 01:04:23,625
I wasn't talking about Su Ah.
I was talking about Yoon Ah.

1194
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:24,710
What?

1195
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,574
Seeing how surprised you are,
I must be right.

1196
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,463
How did you...

1197
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:32,489
I'm very quick to pick up on things,
so don't lie about it.

1198
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:34,860
I'm sorry, Ye Rin.

1199
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,710
Could you keep it a secret?

1200
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,856
Okay. I'll get going, then.

1201
01:04:38,856 --> 01:04:41,760
Thank you, Ye Rin. Goodbye.

1202
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,123
Okay.

1203
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:46,652
Bye.

1204
01:04:49,893 --> 01:04:55,978
<i>However, even Ye Rin who
appeared to be perfect had a fault.</i>

1205
01:04:55,978 --> 01:04:57,376
What?

1206
01:04:58,266 --> 01:05:00,407
Dong Gu likes Yoon Ah?

1207
01:05:00,407 --> 01:05:01,722
<i>Yes, he does.</i>

1208
01:05:01,722 --> 01:05:04,670
I asked him out and he rejected me.

1209
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:07,163
That's when I just knew.

1210
01:05:07,163 --> 01:05:08,983
So, I asked him and he admitted it.

1211
01:05:08,983 --> 01:05:11,902
Dong Gu admitted it?

1212
01:05:12,762 --> 01:05:15,451
Okay, I understand. Bye.

1213
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,440
Dong Gu really likes Yoon Ah?

1214
01:05:22,233 --> 01:05:23,726
Wait a minute.

1215
01:05:23,726 --> 01:05:26,481
<i>What if she figures out that I
like her once I give it to her?</i>

1216
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:30,255
I was asking her to give it to Su Ah,
but I'll give it to her myself... Su Ah.

1217
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:34,146
What? It fits you perfectly.

1218
01:05:34,146 --> 01:05:36,989
<i>Didn't Yoon Ah say she was
going to the grocery store?</i>

1219
01:05:38,106 --> 01:05:40,027
Where are you going?

1220
01:05:41,898 --> 01:05:45,978
Gosh, maybe I should clean.

1221
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:49,195
Dong Gu, you... you...

1222
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,661
- You!
- What?

1223
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:53,052
What is it?

1224
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:57,885
Is that why you ran to the store when
there was a fire and bought that coat?

1225
01:05:57,885 --> 01:06:03,610
So, the person you like isn't me,
but Yoon Ah?

1226
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:05,800
What?

Don't try to get out of it.
Ye Rin told me.

What? She said she'd keep it a secret.

She already told you?

01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:24,277

He actually likes--

1239
