00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:12,371
What's this?

00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:16,611
<i>Then say, "I like you."</i>

5
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:19,544
<i>Dong Gu, I like you.</i>

6
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:20,644
<i>Be cute.</i>

7
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,385
<i>I like you.</i>

00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:23,457
<i>Be strong.</i>

9
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,675
<i>I really like you.</i>

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,712
What is this?

11
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:54,679
I like you.

12
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,817
I really like you, Dong Gu.

13
00:00:58,423 --> 00:01:01,831
Do you want to date me?

14
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:05,126
Yoon Ah.

15
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:17,995
Really?

16
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,400
Yoon Ah told you she liked you?

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,670
Man, you finally succeeded!

18
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,944
You must be happy, Dong Gu.

19
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:26,266
- Congratulations.
- That's good news. Congrats, Dong Gu.

20
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:27,796
Thank you.

21
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,326
Ah, but this is a strange feeling.

22
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:34,215
I'm congratulating my ex-boyfriend
for finding a new girl.

23
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:35,796
Should I be doing this?

24
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,578
Yeah, our Su Ah is very cool.

25
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:40,123
She's the human dry ice.

26
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,436
You can see her breath.

27
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:47,948
Oh, she's here, Dong Gu's girl.

28
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:49,350
The couple.

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,908
Yoon Ah, I'll take that.

30
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:54,450
You're up early. Did you sleep well?

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,512
Yes.

32
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:58,230
What are you doing today?
Going to the academy?

33
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,537
- Yes.
- Are you going to the bakery after?

34
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:02,572
Yes.

35
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,518
- Hm?
- Oh...

36
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:08,189
Ah, I see.

37
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,104
Oh, Sol must be awake.

38
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,177
What's with the mood?

39
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:20,943
- Are you sure you're dating?
- Yes.

40
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:24,021
Yoon Ah told me her feelings yesterday
and asked me to date her.

41
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:25,816
So, did you say that you would date her?

42
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:28,500
Do you really have to say that in words?

43
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,724
Of course, you do.

44
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:31,734
How can you be dating
if you don't say it?

45
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,774
- Right, Doo Shik?
- Huh?

46
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:37,144
Yeah, it doesn't count
if you didn't say you should date.

47
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:38,519
Is that right?

48
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,897
Then are we not really dating yet?

49
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:43,048
You could go ask her
if you're really curious.

50
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:44,974
How can I ask her that now?

51
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:47,556
Hey, what if you find out that
the relationship was one-sided?

52
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:48,918
You think so?

53
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:52,475
That won't do. I should ask her.

54
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:58,841
He's really going to ask her.

55
00:02:58,841 --> 00:02:59,925
Is he a dummy?

56
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:03,181
Hey, they say you become a fool
when you're in love.

57
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:05,679
I really do think he's stupid though!

58
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,775
- Be quiet.
- Why can't I join in on the fun?

59
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:10,860
Goodness.

60
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,514
- Are you having fun making fun of him?
- I'm having so much fun.

61
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:14,784
Me too.

62
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:16,723
That's what I'm saying.

63
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,819
- Be quiet.
- You'd better laugh. Laugh!

64
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,140
Yoon Ah, may I come in?

65
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,400
Yes.

66
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:43,657
Yoon Ah, may I ask you something?

67
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,911
Yes.

68
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:50,953
Well, do you remember confessing
your feelings to me yesterday?

69
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:53,783
You sent me a video
saying that you like me.

70
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:55,615
And you said you wanted to date me.

71
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:58,282
Then we looked at each other and smiled.

72
00:03:58,282 --> 00:03:59,520
Yes.

73
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,088
So, I wanted to clarify...
We are dating, right?

74
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,729
Yes.

75
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:10,519
Right? We are dating.

76
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,120
See, I told them.

77
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,615
Gosh, those guys.

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,416
- Then go on and finish up.
- Yes.

79
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:31,307
Oh, did you ask her?
What did Yoon Ah say?

80
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:33,266
She said we are dating.

81
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:35,329
I told you we were dating.

82
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:39,855
Really? It's just that her reaction
was so strange earlier.

83
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:41,572
What was so strange?

84
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,391
Think about it.
Suppose you have a person you like.

85
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:46,531
You told that person how you feel
and you're dating.

86
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:47,971
How would you feel?

87
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:51,093
I would feel like
I was flying in the sky.

88
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:53,732
That's right,
and that's how you seem right now.

89
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:54,740
Yeah!

90
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,596
But Yoon Ah doesn't
seem that way at all.

91
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,786
Don't you agree, Doo Shik?

92
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:05,153
Yes, she looks a bit depressed
or something.

93
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:06,963
Perhaps a bit sad.

94
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:08,314
You think so?

95
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:12,439
Honestly, I was worried
about how she looked too.

96
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,336
Do you think Yoon Ah is regretting it,
by any chance?

97
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:18,502
Regretting it? What do you mean?

98
00:05:18,502 --> 00:05:21,165
Well, suppose she just said
she wants to date.

99
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:24,346
But she slept on it and now regrets it.
That can happen.

100
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:25,692
Right, Doo Shik?

101
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,552
Of course.

102
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:30,274
I don't have experience.

103
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:32,954
It happens a lot in movies and books.

104
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:36,204
That can't happen. It really can't.

105
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:39,562
Then you should go now
and ask her out on a date.

106
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:42,392
You need to earn points with her
before she changes her mind.

107
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:45,720
Otherwise, you could get dumped.

108
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:50,079
Oh, that really can't happen.

109
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:04,228
<i>[On Behalf Of Lovers Starting Out]</i>

110
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,589
Yes. Okay.

111
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:08,180
Dong Gu went out
on a date with Yoon Ah.

112
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,519
What? Lunch?

113
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,139
I ate already, of course.

114
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,511
Did my Bacca eat a yummy lunch?

115
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,750
- So annoying.
- Yeah, so annoying.

116
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,500
Of course, I miss you too.

117
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,113
Yeah, then see you later.

118
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:28,480
No, you hang up first.

119
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,776
Bacca, you hang up first!

120
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,725
- Geez!
- Huh?

121
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:36,677
What are you doing?

122
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:40,148
What a show you're putting on.
Don't you agree, Doo Shik?

123
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:43,966
I'd like to put on a show too.

124
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:47,430
Joon Ki and Dong Gu
are both having a vibrant spring.

125
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,192
I'm the only one in the middle of winter.

126
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,689
Right, Sol?

127
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,454
You should date too.

128
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,117
There's a lonely person next to you.

129
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:56,607
Who?

130
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,834
Oh, Sol?

131
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:02,488
Her? Su Ah?

132
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:07,740
Yes, it's nice for lonely people
to lean on each other.

133
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,129
Are you crazy, Joon Ki?

134
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,899
How dare you stick
someone like him with me?

135
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,656
Hey, I don't like ignorant people
who don't know arithmetic operations

136
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,954
and think Sado is Yoo Ah In either.

137
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:18,709
- You want to die?
- I take it back.

138
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,930
Anyway, I would never date her.

139
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,625
Don't ever say such a scary thing, okay?

140
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,718
Okay.

141
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:25,365
I find it more terrifying.

142
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:27,247
What a joke.

143
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:31,324
Even the back image of her
is scary and ignorant.

144
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:34,714
Sol, you can't grow up
to be ignorant like her.

145
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:38,103
Let's read the paper and get smarter.

146
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:42,014
Ah, is there some exciting news?

147
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,786
"Heads of household hang their heads
low in this generation."

148
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:47,144
"Forced into retirement."

149
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:50,420
This must be really hard for them, right?

150
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,692
Tell me about it.

151
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:54,552
It's probably torture to look at
the faces of their wives and kids.

152
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:58,036
This is why I'm conflicted about
whether I should marry or not.

153
00:07:58,036 --> 00:07:59,831
Don't worry.

154
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:00,951
You can't get married.

155
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,470
Why would you say
such a terrible thing like that?

156
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,509
What fell out?

157
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:13,634
Wow, they do all kinds of things
at the community center.

158
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:16,100
Development of the baby's five senses.

159
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,509
What is that?

160
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,050
What's this sound? What is it?

161
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,920
Hey, is that your heart again?

162
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,002
Joon Ki, I think...

163
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:33,232
I've fallen in love.

164
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:36,394
With whom? This woman?

165
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:39,788
What are you saying
after seeing a single picture?

166
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:44,625
With this new development,
we're going to the community center!

167
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:47,951
- Why aren't you getting up?
- Me too?

168
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,586
No! Bacca will kill me if she finds out.

169
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:51,933
I didn't tell you to meet her.

170
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,994
I want to meet her. Just come with me.

171
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,927
Joon Ki, let's go.

172
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,797
Let's go to the community center!

173
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:01,974
Let me go put on a show too!

174
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,794
<i>Why is Yoon Ah so quiet?</i>

175
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:11,071
<i>Her expression is dark too.</i>

176
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,354
<i>Is she really regretting
her decision to date me?</i>

177
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,955
<i>That can't happen.</i>

178
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,120
Oh, the weather is so nice.

179
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:22,134
Yoon Ah, what should we do first?

180
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,923
Should we eat first?

181
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:25,187
Yes.

182
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:28,413
What should we eat?

183
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:31,325
- Should we eat blood sausage?
- Yes.

184
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:35,942
- Should we get going then?
- Yes.

185
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,644
<i>What is this? What is this?</i>

186
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,004
<i>Why does she keep saying
"Yes, yes, yes"?</i>

187
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,633
<i>Does she not want to talk to me?</i>

188
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:45,100
<i>I'm going crazy with worry.</i>

189
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:53,511
<i>Ah... I think I'm falling asleep.</i>

190
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:57,125
<i>This is my first date with Yoon Ah.
What kind of atmosphere is this?</i>

191
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:01,451
<i>Gosh, I have to change the mood.</i>

192
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,121
Yoon Ah.

193
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:05,346
Where should we go after eating this?

194
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:07,927
The weather is nice.
Should we go to an amusement park?

195
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:09,158
Yes.

196
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,336
- Do you like going on rides?
- Yes.

197
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,418
Honey, try eating this.

198
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:24,780
Is it good?

199
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:31,698
- Yoon Ah.
- Yes?

200
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,798
Say "ah"... I'll feed you.

201
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:35,804
It's okay.

202
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:38,184
Come on. I want to feed you.

203
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,015
- Say "ah."
- It's really okay.

204
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,167
I'll eat it myself.

205
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,099
Oh, come on now. I want to feed you.

206
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:47,178
- No, it's fine.
- Oh, what's the matter?

207
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,235
I said it's okay.

208
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,668
- Yoon Ah, are you okay?
- Ow.

209
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,797
Oh, it stings. It stings.

210
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:59,956
I think I have salt in my eye.

211
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:03,096
I'll be in the restroom.

212
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,230
Yoon Ah. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

213
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:09,975
I'm seriously going crazy.

214
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,149
Doo Shik.

215
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:21,945
Doesn't it feel like people are
getting the wrong idea about us?

216
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,451
What wrong idea?

217
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:27,153
- You have something on your lip.
- Hm?

218
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:33,993
What are you doing?
People are already looking at us funny.

219
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,803
Are you crazy? Get away from me.

220
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:37,221
Get away, you punk.

221
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:38,551
What?

222
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,408
Hello, hello.

223
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,288
Hello.

224
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,052
- You must be here alone.
- Yes.

225
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:53,033
I thought we were the only men,
but you're here too.

226
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:54,342
How amazing.

227
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:55,698
Yes.

228
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:59,780
I happen to run a business
and I'm always so busy.

229
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,998
I felt like I was neglecting my baby.

230
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:03,508
I decided to make some time.

231
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:05,187
Oh, how cool of you.

232
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:07,095
I see.

233
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:10,534
Do you happen to know
if the instructor is married?

234
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,653
I believe she's single.

235
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:15,388
Really? That's good.

236
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:18,630
- Hello!
- Hello.

237
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,062
We have many dads with us today.

238
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:22,980
Welcome!

239
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,850
Oh... are you mad about something?

240
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,068
Why are you all so quiet?

241
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:30,673
Please give a round of applause.

242
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:35,312
Today, we'll learn a massage technique
that's good for baby development.

243
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:38,707
Please return the mats and oil
to the proper place.

244
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:41,320
Hey, get up.

245
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:45,268
You said you were Sol's uncles?

246
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:47,138
What did you think of the first class?

247
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:49,476
If you thought it was good,
I can help you register...

248
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,296
No, I will politely decline.

249
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:54,038
Don't be like that
and please think it over.

250
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:57,316
She needs to receive massages regularly
to help her in her development.

251
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:58,475
No, thank you.

252
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,721
Joon Ki! What are you doing?
Let's go back home.

253
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:03,092
Okay.

254
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:18,472
Where did you two go?

255
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:22,033
- I witnessed the bitter side of IT.
- Huh?

256
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,480
I wasted my strength going there
because of you.

257
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,855
Sorry.

258
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,464
Wow.

259
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:32,572
Sol's digestive system is active
because of the massage.

260
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:35,448
The sound of her pooing
is louder than usual.

261
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,052
- Yeah. I'll get the diaper.
- Okay.

262
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:40,577
Let's change your diaper.

263
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:42,674
Was she wearing this before?

264
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:46,433
What is this? Huh?

265
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:48,743
- Doo Shik.
- Hm?

266
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:52,756
Did the instructor say that things
would appear if you did the massage?

267
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:54,558
Why? Did Sol get something new?

268
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:55,764
- Yes.
- What?

269
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,374
- A penis.
- Huh?

270
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,392
- What?
- What is this?

271
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:04,993
This isn't Sol.

272
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,741
Yeah, this isn't Sol.

273
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:08,894
I thought something seemed off.

274
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:11,442
What do you mean, it's not Sol?

275
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:14,152
Then, where's Sol? Where is Sol?

276
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:15,761
Hey, that place...

277
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:17,842
- We switched at the community center.
- What?

278
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:19,751
How could you take home a baby
without even checking?

279
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:22,062
It's because you yelled at me
and rushed me!

280
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,166
Shut up! Is this the time to fight now?

281
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,761
Hurry up and get Sol! Hurry!

282
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,894
Yes, yes. Sol.

283
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:30,273
- Sol!
- Sol, Sol!

284
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:32,313
Sol!

285
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:33,625
Seriously!

286
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:46,940
Yoon Ah, I'm sorry.

287
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,100
Is your eye feeling better?

288
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,500
Yes.

289
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,842
- Do you think you can go on a ride?
- Yes.

290
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:57,245
<i>What do I do now?
She looks even more upset.</i>

291
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:59,952
<i>Geez, I have to change the mood somehow.</i>

292
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:02,778
<i>I have to make up for my mistake.</i>

293
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,624
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

294
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:10,349
<i>The right amount of thrill
and the right amount of closeness.</i>

295
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:14,342
<i>The best ride to show my manliness
and bring the mood up.</i>

296
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:16,846
Yoon Ah, should we go on the Viking?

297
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:18,687
What?

298
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:21,668
- Yes.
- Let's go.

299
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:27,418
The Viking will start now.
The safety bar is coming down.

300
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,758
Wow, it's been a long time
since I've been on the Viking.

301
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:36,772
- Yoon Ah, hold tightly.
- Yes.

302
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:39,548
If you're very scared and can't handle it

303
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:41,542
you can lean on me.

304
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:44,522
- All right?
- Yes.

305
00:15:45,513 --> 00:15:47,692
Let's go!

306
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,999
Let's go to the extreme world.

307
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:04,919
- You're not scared?
- No.

308
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,272
<i>Oh my.</i>

309
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:14,759
<i>Was this always this scary?</i>

310
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,432
<i>What is this?</i>

311
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:19,777
<i>Why is this going up so high?</i>

312
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,446
<i>Oh!</i>

313
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:28,672
<i>It's too high.</i>

314
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:32,736
<i>So... so scary. Stop!</i>

315
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:34,556
<i>Stop, stop.</i>

316
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:35,913
Stop!

317
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,958
Mister, Mister!

318
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,043
Please stop. Let me off!

319
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:48,629
No! Let me off!

320
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:50,727
Let me off now.

321
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:58,571
Dong Gu, calm down.

322
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:00,410
Let me off now.

323
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,671
It will end soon.

324
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,076
The safety bar is going up.

325
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:11,963
Dong Gu, it's okay now. Get up.

326
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:14,819
- Really?
- Yes.

327
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,016
It really stopped.

328
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:23,755
I thought I was going to die.

329
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:28,167
Yoon Ah, I'm sorry.

330
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:29,981
I'm really sorry...

331
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,555
Oh my!

332
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:38,269
What do I do?

333
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,910
Oh, Dong Gu!

334
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,846
It's hard enough to go out
and make money.

335
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:51,534
Must I take time off work to prepare
for the ancestral rites ceremony?

336
00:17:57,736 --> 00:17:59,353
- Hello?
- Hello?

337
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:01,192
You're Hee Dong's father, right?

338
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:04,232
I'm Sol's uncle.
We met at the community center.

339
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:07,580
Yes, but what can I do for you?

340
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,736
I believe that our babies were switched.

341
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:11,542
We have Hee Dong.

342
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,034
I think you have our Sol.

343
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:17,521
What? That makes no sense.

344
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,522
What is it? What's going on?

345
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:25,786
Oh, it's nothing.

346
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,604
Let's meet in one minute
in the second floor restroom.

347
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:35,184
What's taking him so long?

348
00:18:35,184 --> 00:18:38,287
Doo Shik, I know we made a mistake.

349
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:41,305
But how can a dad not know
that his baby has been switched?

350
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,961
Is he even a dad? He fails as a dad.

351
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:47,907
Oh, Hee Dong. My Hee Dong.

352
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,423
Mister, what about Sol?

353
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,776
Well, I have a problem.

354
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:56,172
What problem? Where is Sol?

355
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:59,816
Sorry, but please do me a favor.

356
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,204
A favor?

357
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:04,645
To tell you the truth...
I'm unemployed.

358
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:07,445
I got fired from work and I've been
at home for two years.

359
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:11,263
I've been walking on eggshells,
living off my wife's money.

360
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,417
What about it?

361
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:16,567
I'm already being looked down on
by my wife for being unsuccessful.

362
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:20,111
If she finds out that I lost our baby,
she will really divorce me.

363
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:21,747
So, what do you expect us to do?

364
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:24,676
Can't we switch the babies
without my wife knowing?

365
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:27,118
- What?
- Are you kidding?

366
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:30,234
Be quiet and just bring us Sol.

367
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:31,935
It was asking for too much, right?

368
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:33,189
All right.

369
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:36,886
I'll just tell her truth
and give her a divorce.

370
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:38,686
Let's go.

371
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:42,128
Wait, wait. All right, then.

372
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:45,278
Then, what do we have to do?

373
00:19:45,278 --> 00:19:49,096
I have a good plan.

374
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:57,481
There are the cacao nibs!

375
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:02,790
I like cacao nibs.

376
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,505
It's buy one, get one free.

377
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:12,810
Wow, it's priced very low too.

378
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:20,515
Oh, Sol...

379
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,948
It's not buy one, get one free.

380
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:40,972
How long do we have to
keep up with this plan?

381
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,089
He says he'll have to
get divorced though.

382
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,263
I feel bad for him.

383
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:46,739
Why did you have to go there
and get us into this mess?

384
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:48,058
You brought home the wrong baby!

385
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:49,904
Are you saying it's my fault?

386
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:55,104
What is he doing anyway?

387
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,006
Ah, you scared me!

388
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,545
Mister, what are you doing?

389
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:04,366
Sorry, I'm afraid of
getting caught by my wife.

390
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,597
- Can you sit for a moment?
- What?

391
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:09,653
- You can keep a look out.
- What?

392
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:12,115
Stop looking down here!

393
00:21:15,894 --> 00:21:19,584
Mister, how long are we going to do this?

394
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:22,689
Sorry. Think of it as saving a person.

395
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,528
Help me out a little more, okay?

396
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:29,474
I do want to help you,
but your wife isn't giving us a chance.

397
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:34,074
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
I have a plan that will work for certain.

398
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:36,821
What is it this time?

399
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:50,657
<i>This is the plan.</i>

400
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:56,279
<i>The only place we can switch
Hee Dong and Sol is the cash register.</i>

401
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,250
<i>That is the only place
my wife will look away.</i>

402
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,869
<i>Once the cashier is finished,
she will say this...</i>

403
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,460
That will be 158,000 won.

404
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,971
Will you be paying with
credit card or cash?

405
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:09,249
I will pay with my card.

406
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:13,178
<i>Then, Hee Dong's mom will take her hands
off the stroller and get her wallet.</i>

407
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:16,757
<i>The time it takes her to take out
her card is five seconds.</i>

408
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:19,220
- Do you have a point card?
- I'll give you my number.

409
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,705
<i>The time she enters her phone number
to get her points is five seconds.</i>

410
00:22:22,705 --> 00:22:26,646
<i>The time it takes the cashier to swipe
and print the receipt is five seconds.</i>

411
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,053
<i>That's a total of 15 seconds.</i>

412
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:33,464
<i>That 15 seconds is the last chance
to switch Hee Dong and Sol.</i>

413
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:42,098
<i>Make your move when you hear...</i>

414
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:44,304
<i>"Will you be paying
with credit card or cash?"</i>

415
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:46,288
<i>That is it. Keep that in mind.</i>

416
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:48,421
It is 158,000 won.

417
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,797
Will you be paying
with credit card or cash?

418
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:52,858
- I'll pay with my card.
- Okay.

419
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:19,153
<i>Sol...</i>

420
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:50,037
What is this?

421
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:52,422
What are you doing right now?

422
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,378
Well, the thing is...

423
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:58,566
Why are you holding my baby?

424
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:01,759
What? Well, I...

425
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,365
Mister.

426
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:07,535
What? Do you know him?

427
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:09,605
No, this is the first time I've seen him.

428
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:13,714
What? Hey, Mister!
What are you talking about?

429
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,906
Who are you?
Who are you to touch my Hee Dong?

430
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:18,835
Mister, why are you doing this?

431
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:22,214
You dare to go after my Hee Dong?

432
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:23,954
She met a husband so lacking.

433
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:27,529
My Hae Sook works so hard all day
just to make a living for us.

434
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:30,685
She hasn't even been able
to go on a vacation abroad.

435
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:34,115
I've never been able to buy her
pretty clothes, my kind Hae Sook.

436
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:36,474
Along with my love, Hee Dong.

437
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,486
You dare to go after them?

438
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:42,275
If you're going to come after my family,
just kill me instead, you punk!

439
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:43,332
What?

440
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:45,567
What? Why would I kill anyone?

441
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,712
You were talking about 15 seconds--

442
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:50,703
Shut up! Shut up, you punk!

443
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:56,714
<i>Nameless young man, please just
pretend you don't know anything.</i>

444
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:58,513
<i>I'm asking you.</i>

445
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:02,344
<i>Nameless man, this isn't right though.</i>

446
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:06,606
<i>Please save this pitiful father.</i>

447
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,913
Gosh, I've been caught.

448
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:16,556
Is there a husband
so cool as you in the world?

449
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,916
Hey, lady!

450
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:21,839
You should be grateful
to have such a cool husband.

451
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:25,780
I'm going now. I'm going.

452
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:31,777
Don't show up in front of
my family again, you jerks!

453
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,436
- Honey.
- Yeah.

454
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:38,856
I never knew you cared for me so much.

455
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:41,344
Honey!

456
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:48,862
<i>Thank you, nameless young man.</i>

457
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:50,442
<i>There's no need.</i>

458
00:25:50,442 --> 00:25:54,192
<i>Fathers of Korea. You can do it!</i>

459
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:07,410
Yoon Ah, I'm sorry.

460
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,009
I felt so nauseated.

461
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:12,743
You're not upset, are you?

462
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:14,049
No.

463
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:17,776
You're really not angry?

464
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:20,538
No.

465
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,538
<i>She's angry. She's angry.</i>

466
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:25,419
<i>Yoon Ah's expression is so hardened.</i>

467
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,893
<i>I threw a sausage at her eye
and vomited on her on our first date.</i>

468
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:30,672
<i>How could she not be angry?</i>

469
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,288
<i>It's a disaster.
She looks like she totally regrets it.</i>

470
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:38,344
Yoon Ah, are you thirsty?
Should I buy you something to drink?

471
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:39,563
Yes.

472
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:43,692
Wait a little bit.

473
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:07,587
It's over. It's all over.

474
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:10,675
Her expression is dark and
she's only said "yes" or "no" all day.

475
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:15,221
I'm certain she regrets
deciding to date me.

476
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:16,968
It's a disaster.

477
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:19,617
It's a disaster...

478
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,705
<i>[Seo Jin]</i>

479
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:34,838
Yes, Seo Jin. We're heading in now.

480
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:36,440
Sol's playing well, right?

481
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,435
Yes, Sol was very good.

482
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:45,559
How about you?
Did you have fun on your date?

483
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:51,416
Honestly, I was so nervous being alone
with Dong Gu and didn't know what to say.

484
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:54,987
My mind was blank all day
and I only said, "Yes, yes."

485
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:57,615
That's all I could manage.

486
00:27:57,615 --> 00:27:59,407
What if Dong Gu is angry?

487
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:02,176
I'm so worried I could die.

488
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:06,654
I can't focus on anything right now.
I'll talk to you once I get home.

489
00:28:06,654 --> 00:28:08,960
Yeah. Okay.

490
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:15,178
Dong Gu.

491
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:22,667
That's what it was.

492
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,435
I didn't even know.

493
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:27,765
What?

494
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:34,450
Dong... Dong Gu.

495
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,170
Are you crying right now?

496
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,903
No, I thought that you...

497
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:47,907
You weren't talking and had such
a dark expression on your face.

498
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:50,898
I thought you regretted
deciding to date me.

499
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:54,778
I was anxious all day and worried.

500
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:57,989
I thought we would end up breaking up.

501
00:28:57,989 --> 00:29:00,185
Why would I break up with you, Dong Gu?

502
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:04,993
Just being next to you,
my heart races and I'm nervous.

503
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,717
Do you mean that?

504
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:09,925
You should have told me, then.
You're so mean.

505
00:29:09,925 --> 00:29:13,050
You made me worry so much.

506
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,724
Then, Yoon Ah...

507
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:22,243
you don't regret dating me, right?

508
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,317
No.

509
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:27,797
Then today is
our official first day, right?

510
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:34,019
Since we are a couple now...

511
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:38,355
we can hold hands.

512
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,670
Yoon Ah.

513
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,699
Do you want to go on
a proper date tomorrow?

514
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:05,284
Yes.

515
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:08,150
But don't you have anything else
to say besides "yes" or "no"?

516
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:10,857
No.

517
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:13,420
Never mind. Never mind.

518
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,625
Let's just go. Let's go.

519
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:28,895
<i>All right. You know we have
many guests booked today.</i>

520
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:32,055
So, make sure to clean well.

521
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,006
- Yeah.
- Okay.

522
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:35,528
Oh!

523
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:38,269
Yoon Ah, give that to me. I'll do it.

524
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,009
It's really all right.

525
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:41,560
Thank you, Dong Gu.

526
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,400
No need to thank me.

527
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,779
You should go in and rest with Sol.

528
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,542
Oh, no.

529
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:53,924
Seo Jin, you should go in and rest.

530
00:30:53,924 --> 00:30:56,352
You worked late last night.
You shouldn't be cleaning.

531
00:30:56,352 --> 00:31:00,266
Thank you. You're the best, Joon Ki.

532
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,530
Why don't you all cut it out?

533
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,961
You're making single people so sad.
How can I live?

534
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:07,009
You should date too of you're envious.

535
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:10,689
You're being petulant
just because you're jealous!

536
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:11,945
Wait and see.

537
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:17,769
Soon, I'll be dating a woman
way better than Yoon Ah and Seo Jin.

538
00:31:18,307 --> 00:31:20,565
Really?

539
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:25,769
But my Yoon Ah is pretty, kind, pure,
and like the morning dew.

540
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:28,323
I don't know if there's
anyone like that in the world.

541
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:29,632
You're right.

542
00:31:29,632 --> 00:31:32,356
I don't know who's cuter
and more adorable than my Bacca.

543
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:37,105
You won't find another woman who can
grow a better mustache than Park Chan Ho.

544
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,917
Give it a rest.

545
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,628
What are you doing?

546
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:46,501
Stop it, would you? You're not children.

547
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:48,394
Where's Su Ah?

548
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:50,490
I don't know. I think she's in the room.

549
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,527
What? Everyone's cleaning.
What's she doing in the room?

550
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:05,305
What are you doing?

551
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:09,339
Oh, I wasn't doing anything.

552
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:12,785
You're not doing
a cucumber pack, are you?

553
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:15,855
No, I cut them to make food with.

554
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:18,423
Why would you put them on your face then?

555
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:20,271
Ah, this?

556
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:23,326
I'm salting them
because we don't have salt.

557
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:24,574
My face is salty.

558
00:32:24,574 --> 00:32:27,212
What a joke. Stop it and come clean.

559
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:30,586
Hey, I have a photo shoot for my
shopping mall so I have to do skincare.

560
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:32,367
That's your problem.

561
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,175
You're living here for free,
yet you have some nerve.

562
00:32:35,175 --> 00:32:37,126
What do you mean
I'm living here for free?

563
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:38,287
I'm a long-term guest!

564
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:40,361
Long-term guest? Yeah right.

565
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:43,230
Why are you two fighting again? Stop it.

566
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,711
Why do you two fight every time
you see each other?

567
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:48,111
- She's acting irrationally.
- What?

568
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:50,932
Irrationally? You have
no manners toward your elders.

569
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:52,738
Kang Seo Jin, are you finished?

570
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:53,938
Yes, I am. What?

571
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,153
You have to act like my elder
to be treated like one.

572
00:32:56,153 --> 00:32:59,776
- Seriously, you...
- Stop it, would you?

573
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:06,991
That was so hard. I thought I'd die.

574
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:09,182
I have no energy to get up.

575
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:11,042
Good work.

576
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:26,508
Welcome.

577
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:36,078
Who are you?

578
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:39,319
I have a booking for today.

579
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,083
What? What language is this?

580
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,776
Does she have a booking?

581
00:33:51,672 --> 00:33:54,259
Oh, are you Angela?

582
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:56,839
- Yes, yes. Angela.
- Angela...

583
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,980
What was that earlier?
What language was that?

584
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,269
Looks like she's from Ukraine.

585
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:04,819
I guess she can't speak English.

586
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:06,186
Can you speak English?

587
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:09,481
No. Sorry, I only speak Ukrainian.

588
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,567
What is she saying?

589
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,260
Seems like she can't speak English.

590
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,867
Nothing we can do then.

591
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:16,436
I will take you to your room.

592
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:18,168
Follow me.

593
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,170
She's really pretty.

594
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,260
I thought she was a doll or something.

595
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,041
Right, Doo Shik?

596
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:41,612
What's that? What's that sound?

597
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:45,213
Hey, is that the sound
of your heart again?

598
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:46,753
Joon Ki.

599
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:50,280
I think I've fallen in love.

600
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,621
What? Again?

601
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:54,695
You're always falling in love.

602
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:57,032
It's real this time.

603
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:59,894
I haven't felt fate this strong before.

604
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:02,342
Dream on, man.

605
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,869
You think you can
get a goddess like that?

606
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,211
If you don't have a chance,
don't even look.

607
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:09,626
You'll get a headache.

608
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:12,554
Hey! Get it together. Hey, hey.

609
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:14,931

Hm? Yes?

613
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:38,673
Angela, would you like to drink this?

614
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:39,711
Drinking.

615
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:41,692
Oh, thank you.

617
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:47,896

00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,173
I don't think she understood.
Did it not work?

628

Angela.

629
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:21,307
Do you happen to have a boyfriend?

Sorry. I have somewhere to go.

Gosh, what is this?

637
00:36:38,672 --> 00:36:42,010
This translator isn't working.
What should I do?

638
00:36:45,108 --> 00:36:47,177
Scrub hard and get them clean.

639
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:49,215
All right. I am scrubbing hard.

640
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:51,409
What right do you have to yell?

641
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,766

00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:57,347
Yes, Senior.

00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:58,739

What? Why would you do it?

I don't know and I can't say no
because she's my senior.

Goodness, you never back down from me.

660
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:42,791
You can't say a word to your senior.

00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:46,594

I'm studying Ukrainian. Why?

I don't know what

Hey, you think that's going to solve it?

I have to try to talk to Angela.

Don't you worry.

671
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:22,438
We found a way for you to talk to Angela.

00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:24,625
Really? How?

673

- Come in, come in.
- Come in!

674
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:29,710
- Yeah!
- Hello.

675
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,195
What's with these people?
Aren't they our guests?

676
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:34,768
Listen up.

677
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:38,557
The problem is that you can't
communicate with Angela.

678
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:42,175
Why? Angela only speaks Ukrainian.

679
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:43,617
- Right?
- Yes.

680
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:45,817
This is where it gets
a little bit complicated.

681
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:49,630
- So, focus and listen, okay?
- Okay.

682
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,038
First, Mark from Germany
speaks Ukrainian.

683
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:55,887
And Bruno from France speaks German.

684
00:38:55,887 --> 00:39:00,067
Also, Hanako from Japan can speak
some French and Korean.

00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:02,157
- Do you understand?
- Not at all.

686
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:06,246
- What does this have to do with Angela?
- Gosh, this kid.

687
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:10,708
So, Angela can tell Mark in Ukrainian.

688
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:13,360
Then Mark can tell Bruno in French.

689
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,246
Then Bruno can tell Hanako in French.

690
00:39:16,246 --> 00:39:18,931
Then Hanako can interpret it
to you in Korean.

691
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:20,353
That's what it is. Understand?

692
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:22,266

You'll be able to talk to her.

696
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,690
What? You don't want to?

697
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,271
- Then forget it!
- No, no, no.

698
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,320
- Thanks, Joon Ki.
- What are you doing?

699
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,333
- Go tell her how you feel.
- I should.

Go, go, go, go!

That guy... he's so happy.

704
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:54,322
But will Angela accept Doo Shik
just because they can communicate?

705
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:56,342
Would that make sense?

706
00:39:56,342 --> 00:40:00,500
They grant wishes to dying people,
so I thought we should let him confess.

707
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,755
It's obvious that
he'll get pitifully dumped.

708
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:07,670
Then should we go to comfort Doo Shik?

709
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,539
Should we? Doo Shik may cry again.

710
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:12,648
Should we bring some tissues?

711
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:14,318
Should I bring two boxes?

712
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:16,105
Should we do that?

713
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:24,483
What are you doing?
Tell her how you feel.

714
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:26,980
Okay... I will.

715
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:30,101
Well...

716
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,349
I fell for you at first sight.

717
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:35,215
Really? Since when?

718
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:36,735
What did you like about me?

719
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,434
- Huh?
- Hanako.

720
00:40:38,434 --> 00:40:40,186
He's not talking to you.

721
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:42,981
- You have to tell that to Angela.
- Oh...

722
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:44,590
I was confused.

723
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:54,722
Angela, I fell for you at first sight.

724
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:56,230
Really?

725
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:03,369
No, Angela! Not that guy.

726
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:06,501
This guy... he likes you.

727
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:08,179
Ah...

728
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:13,092
Can you... ask her what she thinks of me?

729
00:41:13,092 --> 00:41:14,726
Okay.

730
00:41:14,726 --> 00:41:20,552
What do you think about me?

731
00:41:20,552 --> 00:41:24,452
I like you. I had a good
first impression of you yesterday.

732
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:31,268
She says she likes you and liked you
when you first met yesterday.

733
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:32,510
Lucky you.

734
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,985
She says she likes you.

735
00:41:33,985 --> 00:41:36,617
Really? Really?

736
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:41,813
Then ask her,
"Angela, will you date me?"

737
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:43,317
Hurry.

738
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:44,766
I'd like to.

739
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:46,351
She says yes.

740
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:47,719
Really?

741
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:50,449
Really? Really, Angela?

742
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:53,519
Thank you. Thank you so much!

743
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,541
Joon Ki, Dong Gu!

744
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:58,306
Thank you so much.
It's all thanks to you guys.

745
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:00,114
Thank you so much!

746
00:42:00,804 --> 00:42:02,699
That's great.

747
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:05,050
I didn't really do anything.

748
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:14,333
Oh, I finally finished.

749
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,360
What am I doing all night on my day off?

750
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,166
If she weren't my senior, I would just...

751
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:24,025
No, hold it in.

752
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,829
My work life can get hard
if I act this way.

753
00:42:27,603 --> 00:42:29,657
I'm so hungry.

754
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:32,911
Maybe I should go and eat something.

755
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:36,931
Hey, lend me the hair dryer--

756
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:41,237
Oh, my cell phone.

757
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:43,336
What are you doing?

758
00:42:43,336 --> 00:42:45,806
Sorry. I didn't do it on purpose!

759
00:42:45,806 --> 00:42:47,577
You are such a klutz.

760
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:51,137
I said I'm sorry. You can get it out.

761
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:03,150
I can't see well. Shine your light on it.

762
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,969
Okay, I am.

763
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:07,302
- Over to the side some more.
- Okay.

764
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:12,123
Oh, there it is.

765
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,952
Here.

766
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:18,161
Ow... oh.

767
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,322
I got it.

768
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:23,112
I got it out.

769
00:43:23,112 --> 00:43:24,192
Ow!

770
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:26,559
What? What is this?

771
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:28,639
What happened here?

772
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,190
- Ow!
- Ow!

773
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,121
My hair is tangled in your brush.
What are you going to do?

774
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:37,396
It's because you rubbed your head
on mine. Why is it my fault?

775
00:43:37,987 --> 00:43:41,757
- Ow!
- Just stay still.

776
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:51,090
- It hurts, it hurts!
- It hurts!

777
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:55,940
I don't think I can do anything.
It just won't come loose.

778
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,827
Really? This is insane.

779
00:43:58,827 --> 00:44:00,864
What should we do then?

780
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:04,141
Do you think they could do it
at a hair salon?

781
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,967
A hair salon?

782
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:07,389
Yeah!

783
00:44:11,731 --> 00:44:13,784
Angela. Say, ah...

784
00:44:20,543 --> 00:44:22,172
You know what?

785
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:26,565
Angela has some
unexpectedly low standards.

786
00:44:26,565 --> 00:44:28,717
- Don't you think?
- Yes.

787
00:44:28,717 --> 00:44:31,846
Isn't that couple too unbalanced?

788
00:44:31,846 --> 00:44:33,536
I know.

789
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:36,956
They're like beauty and the beast.

790
00:44:36,956 --> 00:44:40,760
No, more like beauty
and the dwarf's poop.

791
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,626
Why? I think the suit each other well.

792
00:44:43,626 --> 00:44:47,688
Are you two envious that
Doo Shik got a pretty girlfriend?

793
00:44:48,596 --> 00:44:49,795
Why would we be?

794
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:52,286
I have a girlfriend
as pretty as you, Yoon Ah.

795
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:54,791
Why would I be envious?

796
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:58,094
<i>I am envious. I am so envious.</i>

797
00:44:58,094 --> 00:45:00,273
<i>I feel extremely annoyed.</i>

798
00:45:00,273 --> 00:45:04,434
<i>Why? How could Doo Shik
get a girl like Angela?</i>

799
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,784
Of course. Why would we be envious?

800
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:12,204
I have a cute and adorable
girlfriend like Seo Jin.

801
00:45:12,204 --> 00:45:15,585
<i>I feel bitter. I feel so bitter.</i>

802
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:19,516
<i>It's as if I have
a big stone in my chest.</i>

803
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:22,516
<i>My frustration is boiling over.</i>

804
00:45:23,945 --> 00:45:25,786
Ow!

805
00:45:26,612 --> 00:45:28,088
I don't think I can fix this.

806
00:45:28,088 --> 00:45:30,846
It's so badly tangled
that I can't get it untangled.

807
00:45:30,846 --> 00:45:32,485
You should just cut your hair.

808
00:45:32,485 --> 00:45:34,882
What? Cut our hair?

809
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:37,480
No, then the style would get ruined.

810
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,181
Will you go around like this forever?

811
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:44,539
One person has to cut their bangs
in order to get out this.

812
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:47,231
- There's no choice. You cut your hair.
- What?

813
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:51,340
Hey, I'm the president of a shopping mall
and the model of that mall.

814
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,380
How can I cut off my hair?

815
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,260
Then you want me to do it?
These are all the bangs that I have.

816
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,706
How am I supposed to go to work
and research stories?

817
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:00,706
I don't know.
I can't ever cut mine though.

818
00:46:00,706 --> 00:46:03,206
I can't cut mine either,
over my dead body.

819
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:04,849
It's your fault, so you cut it.

820
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,099
Why is it my fault? You cut yours.

821
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:09,003
You're like my enemy.

822
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:12,458
Who is this? It's my senior again.

823
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:14,646
Yes, Senior.

824
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,302
<i>I received your summary.</i>

825
00:46:16,302 --> 00:46:19,201
Can you come to my house now?

826
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,585
What? Now?

827
00:46:21,585 --> 00:46:24,045
Ah, I have something going on right now.

828
00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:27,315
Don't give me excuses
and come within 30 minutes.

829
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:30,219
Senior, Senior!

830
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:32,317
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

831
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:35,347
- What now?
- I don't know. My senior says to come.

832
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:37,416
So, hurry up and cut your hair.

833
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:42,043
Why would I? You're the one in a hurry.
I have nothing to lose at all.

834
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:45,637
Oh, really? You want to test me?

835
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:48,202
Hey, hey! Ouch! Hey!

836
00:46:48,202 --> 00:46:50,646
It hurts. Hold on!

837
00:46:56,351 --> 00:46:58,458
Where are our board games?

838
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,215
Angela wants to play.
Do you want to join?

839
00:47:00,215 --> 00:47:02,175
- No, thanks.
- Same here.

840
00:47:02,175 --> 00:47:03,856
No? Never mind, then.

841
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:10,681
Doo Shik, are you
really going to be okay?

842
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:11,791
Hm?

843
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,525
- With what?
- I mean Angela.

844
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:19,518
- Do you know everything about Angela?
- What do you mean?

845
00:47:19,518 --> 00:47:22,248
Angela is such a pretty person.

846
00:47:22,248 --> 00:47:26,251
It doesn't make any sense
that she doesn't have a boyfriend.

847
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:27,653
Think about it.

848
00:47:27,653 --> 00:47:29,498
There's a girl as pretty as her.

849
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:32,989
Do you really think that the guys
around her would've left her alone?

850
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:35,927
Yes, that would never have happened.

851
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:38,739
Then are you saying
she could be dating other guys?

852
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:41,576
No, I'm not saying
that's necessarily the case.

853
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:44,759
When you go on a trip,
you say you're single even if you're not.

854
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:48,050
You want to cheat and stuff
for some reason.

855
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,007
Yes, yes.

856
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:52,985
100 percent,
people do that on trips.

857
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:55,865
Then should I go ask her
if she has a boyfriend?

858
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:58,231
Well, you could.

859
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:15,719
Well, I'm just worried about Doo Shik.

860
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,478
Me too. I don't want to see him get hurt.

861
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:30,128
Angela, I'm sorry to
ask you something like this.

862
00:48:30,128 --> 00:48:33,085
Do you happen to have
a boyfriend in Ukraine?

863
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:34,601
Please ask, Hanako.

864
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:36,255
Okay.

865
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:39,670
No, she doesn't.
You're her first boyfriend.

866
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,144
She's pretty and she's very innocent too.

867
00:48:42,144 --> 00:48:45,144
Seriously, how annoying.

868
00:48:46,797 --> 00:48:49,222
Really? I'm her first boyfriend?

869
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:50,693
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

870
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:52,938
I'm so relieved.

871
00:48:54,436 --> 00:48:57,722
What? Angela doesn't have a boyfriend?

872
00:48:57,722 --> 00:49:01,043
Also, you're the first boyfriend
she has ever had?

873
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:02,152
That's right.

874
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:04,800
So, I'm her first love... first love.

875
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,360
Really? That's nice.

876
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,338
Yes... that is good.

877
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:12,358
Must be nice, Doo Shik. Congratulations.

878
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:14,197
Yeah. Thank you.

879
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:17,467
Doo Shik, do you have to
widen your eyes like that?

880
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:20,838
Did you know that the way you look
at people can be upsetting?

881
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:23,768
Really? Sorry, I'll be careful.

882
00:49:27,085 --> 00:49:29,065
Doo Shik!

883
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:31,494
Can you be careful with your footsteps
when you walk?

884
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:33,532
You make a loud sound when you walk.

885
00:49:33,532 --> 00:49:35,248
It can be really annoying.

886
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:38,213
Really? Sorry, I'll be careful.

887
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,306
We're here. Let's get out.

888
00:49:58,306 --> 00:50:00,356
Ow. Get out on this side.

889
00:50:00,356 --> 00:50:03,900
You know you can't open that door
from the inside. Get out.

890
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,681
Why won't you ever back down once?
Can you wait?

891
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:09,460
What are you doing?

892
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,706
You're not rebelling against me, are you?

893
00:50:12,706 --> 00:50:14,963
Not at all, Senior.

894
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:17,510
I had a problem come up.

895
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,603
Forget it. These are my clothes.

896
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:22,038
- Go to the store and exchange sizes.
- What?

897
00:50:22,038 --> 00:50:24,836
I have somewhere important to go tonight.

898
00:50:24,836 --> 00:50:30,467
I ate a lot of beef tripe and soju
last night and now it doesn't fit.

899
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:33,447
I called the department store already,
so you just need to exchange it.

900
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,068
Ah... okay.

901
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:39,443
What are you doing?
There's no time, so hurry up.

902
00:50:42,043 --> 00:50:44,155
What? What kind of person does that?

903
00:50:44,155 --> 00:50:46,157
Why would she tell you
to exchange her clothes?

904
00:50:46,157 --> 00:50:48,840
I don't know. Just follow me.

905
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,621
Ah! Tell me before you go. It hurts.

906
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:59,128
I'm Angela's first love. Awesome, right?

907
00:50:59,128 --> 00:51:02,675
Yes. It worked out well, Doo Shik.

908
00:51:02,675 --> 00:51:05,306
But, you know...

909
00:51:05,306 --> 00:51:07,666
- Will you be okay?
- Hm?

910
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:08,717
What now?

911
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:13,797
It's not so easy to maintain
an international relationship.

912
00:51:13,797 --> 00:51:15,489
That is true.

913
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:19,869
People get tired and are swayed easily
when someone else comforts them.

914
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:22,166
Then they betray the other person.
That's how it is.

915
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,367
That's what happens
100 times out of 100.

916
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:26,260
It does?

917
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,880
I'd better go ask her.

918
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:32,938
Hey, who knew Angela
was an exchange student?

919
00:51:32,938 --> 00:51:37,096
If she has any intention of living here,
then we could even get married.

920
00:51:37,096 --> 00:51:38,534
I guess so.

921
00:51:38,534 --> 00:51:40,396
That's so great.

922
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:44,393
Yes, how could this happen?

923
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:48,322
By the way, Doo Shik,
are your parents okay with it?

924
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:50,068
- Hm? My parents?
- Yes.

925
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,018
She is a foreign girl, after all.

926
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:55,983
There is still prejudice in our country
due to Confucianism.

927
00:51:55,983 --> 00:52:00,695
Will your parents end up
accepting you dating Angela?

928
00:52:00,695 --> 00:52:02,273
That's true.

929
00:52:02,273 --> 00:52:05,384
Everyone I know is against it.
100 out of 100.

930
00:52:05,384 --> 00:52:08,824
Oh, yeah. I didn't think about that.

931
00:52:10,201 --> 00:52:14,360
Wow, I have never seen my parents
so happy about anything.

932
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,688
I never imagined they would already
call her their daughter-in-law.

933
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:20,842
Yeah... that's good.

934
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:21,922
Congratulations.

935
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:23,588
Congratulations, Doo Shik.

936
00:52:23,588 --> 00:52:25,478
Thank you.

937
00:52:25,478 --> 00:52:28,998
Doo Shik, can't you do something
about your gums showing when you smile?

938
00:52:28,998 --> 00:52:30,601
It's really unlikeable!

939
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:32,041
Oh... really?

940
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,690
Sorry, I'll be careful.

941
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,505
Also, Doo Shik...

942
00:52:35,505 --> 00:52:38,284
can you do something about
your nostrils getting big when you smile?

943
00:52:38,284 --> 00:52:40,974
It's like your nostrils are laughing
at others and it's annoying!

944
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:43,347
Really? Sorry. I'll be careful.

945
00:52:45,242 --> 00:52:47,670
Oh yeah. I'm supposed to
drink beer with Angela.

946
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,393
I'll be upstairs.

947
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:54,110
He was wiggling his fingers.

948
00:52:55,726 --> 00:52:58,628
- Oh, my stomach.
- Oh my.

949
00:53:02,903 --> 00:53:04,655
Senior, here.

950
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:06,822
Hey! What took you so long?

951
00:53:06,822 --> 00:53:10,380
What's wrong with you
that you can't even do this?

952
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,333
I'm sorry.

953
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:14,952
Never mind! Go.

954
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,409
What kind of person is like that?

955
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:25,219
You ran an errand for her and
she can't even say thank you.

956
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:27,579
It's fine. Let's go now.

957
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,469
Hey, you're always arguing with me.

958
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:32,248
Why can't you say anything to her?

959
00:53:32,248 --> 00:53:33,976
It really doesn't suit you.

960
00:53:33,976 --> 00:53:36,579
What can I do? She's my work senior.

961
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:39,568
I've already said so much to her
inside my heart thousands of times.

962
00:53:39,568 --> 00:53:43,849
Really? So, you would you
go against her you could?

963
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:45,579
Yes, but why?

964
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:46,960
What are you thinking?

965
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,230
Don't do it.
My work life could be ruined.

966
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,934
Don't worry. I'll make sure
you don't get caught.

967
00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:55,664
Where's a convenience store around here?

968
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:57,315
Why do you need that?

969
00:53:58,965 --> 00:54:00,715
She's coming out. She's coming.

970
00:54:00,715 --> 00:54:04,135
Honey. I'm leaving now.

971
00:54:04,135 --> 00:54:06,516
Yes, I'll see you later.

972
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:08,143
Yes.

973
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,766
What's with this?

974
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:13,969
What is this?

975
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:16,326
What happened here? Oh no.

976
00:54:21,628 --> 00:54:23,655
Oh my...

977
00:54:23,655 --> 00:54:27,378
Hey! Who did this?

978
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,492
You think that will come off easily?

979
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:35,304
That's extra strength super glue.

980
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:38,815
But... is this okay to do?

981
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:41,420
It's "In Gan Heung Bo."

982
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,137
You must mean "In Gwa Eung Bo,"
like retributive justice.

983
00:54:44,137 --> 00:54:46,318
You are really ignorant.

984
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,418
Hey, why is that important right now?
Punishing her is what's important.

985
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:51,780
What are you doing? Step on it.

986
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,530
I'm in big trouble if I get caught.

987
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,726
Hey, you won't get caught.

988
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,378
Just duck a bit and she won't see you.

989
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,070
- But, still...
- Hey.

990
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,188
I used 20 liters of water
and worked hard making that.

991
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:04,565
Step on it!

992
00:55:04,565 --> 00:55:06,769
Gosh, whatever then.

993
00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:11,905
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

994
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:15,554
Just duck a bit and she won't see you.

995
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:17,295
- But, still...
- Hey.

996
00:55:17,295 --> 00:55:20,405
I used 20 liters of water
and worked hard making that.

997
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:21,842
Step on it!

998
00:55:21,842 --> 00:55:23,992
Gosh, whatever then.

999
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:29,219
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1000
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:34,746
Duck!

1001
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:49,407
Hey! Who are you? Hey!

1002
00:55:52,635 --> 00:55:55,534
Oh, that sure feels good.

1003
00:55:55,534 --> 00:55:58,275
You should be nice in life.

1004
00:55:58,275 --> 00:56:00,436
Su Ah, that felt so sweet.

1005
00:56:00,436 --> 00:56:01,976
So sweet!

1006
00:56:01,976 --> 00:56:03,985
Right? You feel so much better,
don't you?

1007
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,182
Yes. Thank you, Su Ah.

1008
00:56:05,182 --> 00:56:07,476
If you're so thankful,
can I do cucumber packs?

1009
00:56:07,476 --> 00:56:09,619
No, never.

1010
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:12,481
Hey, you don't know to be thankful
when I got revenge for you?

1011
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:14,481
I'll repay you. I can repay you.

1012
00:56:14,481 --> 00:56:16,494
You know I can't live
being indebted to someone.

1013
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:18,036
How will you pay me back?

1014
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,396
Why have you two looked that way all day?

1015
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:32,996
Is something wrong?

1016
00:56:32,996 --> 00:56:35,177
I don't know.

1017
00:56:35,177 --> 00:56:38,458
I just suddenly don't have any strength.

1018
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:42,777
Yes, I suddenly feel down
and don't have an appetite.

1019
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:45,586
I feel so lazy and slow.

1020
00:56:45,586 --> 00:56:47,538
Why is that?

1021
00:56:48,286 --> 00:56:50,717
- We're back.
- You're home?

1022
00:56:50,717 --> 00:56:54,916
You're home?
Why have you been out all day...

1023
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:59,672
What is that?
What's with your hair, Seo Jin?

1024
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:03,485
You're draining my energy.

1025
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,443
What is that? What is that?

1026
00:57:11,443 --> 00:57:13,934
Our Seo Jin, where have you been?

1027
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:16,507
Why do you look like that?

1028
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:17,775
Don't do that.

1029
00:57:17,775 --> 00:57:19,782
Why do you suddenly have hair
like Choo Sarang?

1030
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:21,010
What happened to your bangs?

1031
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,059
Something happened, is all.

1032
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:26,047
Anyway, I don't owe you anything more.

1033
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:28,431
Okay, okay.

1034
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:32,125
Gosh, you never want to lose to me.

1035
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,871
<i>- Cheers. Yeah!</i>
- What is that?

1036
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:37,891
Sounds like Doo Shik.
Why is he in such a good mood?

1037
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:41,101
Well, Doo Shik and Angela
decided to start dating today.

1038
00:57:41,101 --> 00:57:42,561
Things must be going really well.

1039
00:57:42,561 --> 00:57:45,583
Really? Doo Shik must be so happy.

1040
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:48,286
Ah, why can't I digest my food?

1041
00:57:48,286 --> 00:57:52,764
Oh, my stomach.
Why does it hurt so much?d

1042
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:55,795
Oh my. Oh, my stomach.

1043
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:57,190
What's with them?

1044
00:57:58,574 --> 00:58:00,806
Cheers!

1045
00:58:00,806 --> 00:58:04,010
Drink, drink, drink. One shot!

1046
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:08,605
I'm sleepy now.

1047
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,539
Stop drinking. Let's sleep.

1048
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:14,041
Let's drink a little more.
The mood is still good.

1049
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,269
Bullshit.

1050
00:58:15,269 --> 00:58:18,478
- Good, my ass.
- "Bullshit"? "Ass"?

1051
00:58:18,478 --> 00:58:21,608
Hanako, who did you learn Korean from?

1052
00:58:21,608 --> 00:58:23,219
You learned all the bad words.

1053
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:24,916
Oh, I have to pee.

1054
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:27,806
Hey, I'll be in the bathroom.

1055
00:58:27,806 --> 00:58:29,166
Tell Angela.

1056
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,987
Pee or poo?

1057
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:32,416
Do I have to tell you that?

1058
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:35,186
Then we know how long
we have to wait for you.

1059
00:58:35,186 --> 00:58:38,782
Gosh, okay.
It's pee, pee, pee. Happy now?

1060
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,480
Okay.

1061
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:47,775
He is going to poo.

1062
00:58:48,298 --> 00:58:50,855
What? Why bother telling me that?

1063
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:54,056
What are you saying?
It's so hard to go pee.

1064
00:58:54,056 --> 00:58:58,047
Angela, wait just a little bit.
I'll be back soon.

1065
00:58:58,047 --> 00:58:59,927
Have fun and drink.

1066
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,882
Angela, what's wrong?

1067
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:12,056
It's so uncomfortable
being unable to talk to Doo Shik.

1068
00:59:12,056 --> 00:59:14,603
It must be hard for you
to have to interpret, right?

1069
00:59:14,603 --> 00:59:17,208
No, I liked being able to be with you.

1070
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:20,083
After talking to you,
I feel like you're a good person.

1071
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:25,733
Really? Honestly, I liked you too...

1072
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:27,215
Really?

1073
00:59:36,588 --> 00:59:39,471
Ah, what if I end up
marrying Angela, at this rate?

1074
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:44,289
Wait, then we'll do a Ukrainian wedding
and a Korean wedding.

1075
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,094
Do we have to do it twice?
What about the guests?

1076
00:59:47,094 --> 00:59:48,791
Do we have to rent out a plane?

1077
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:50,719
I don't know. What do I do?

1078
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,197
Angela. My Angela...

1079
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:02,679
Oh my.

1080
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:05,427
What's wrong with your faces?

1081
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:08,507
I guess it's insomnia.
We couldn't sleep all night.

1082
01:00:08,507 --> 01:00:09,996
I couldn't sleep at all.

1083
01:00:09,996 --> 01:00:13,657
Maybe it's because
I'm stressed about my filming.

1084
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:16,447
My insomnia is severe.

1085
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,318
Really?

1086
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:20,159
This is a problem.

1087
01:00:21,547 --> 01:00:24,135
That's weird. Where is she?

1088
01:00:24,135 --> 01:00:26,737
What is it? Are you looking for someone?

1089
01:00:26,737 --> 01:00:29,909
I woke up this morning
and Angela was gone.

1090
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:31,699
Her stuff is gone from her room too.

1091
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:34,684
Oh, Hanako. Have you seen Angela?

1092
01:00:34,684 --> 01:00:38,826
Angela? She packed up
early this morning and left.

1093
01:00:38,826 --> 01:00:42,161
What do you mean she left?

1094
01:00:42,161 --> 01:00:48,012
Well, yesterday Angela and Mark
were together until late at night.

1095
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:51,418
- The mood was strange between them.
- What?

1096
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:55,233
- Then they both left this morning.
- What?

1097
01:00:56,043 --> 01:00:59,530
Hey, what do you mean by that? Hey!

1098
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:04,753
Then, did Angela and Mark
cheat and run away together?

1099
01:01:04,753 --> 01:01:06,733
- What?
- Oh, how could it be?

1100
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:09,532
They were attracted to each other!

1101
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,403
They speak each other's language
and he's good looking.

1102
01:01:11,403 --> 01:01:14,891
100 times out of 100, they would be
attracted to each other in that case.

1103
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:18,016
That makes no sense. That can't be.

1104
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:22,567
Angela, Angela, Angela, Angela!

1105
01:01:22,567 --> 01:01:24,293
Oh dear.

1106
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:26,876
I feel bad for Doo Shik.
What do we do?

1107
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:30,885
I really wanted things to work out
for him this time.

1108
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:32,885
I know.

1109
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:39,137
I even prayed all night that
he would no longer be a single guy.

1110
01:01:39,137 --> 01:01:42,485
I feel so bad for Doo Shik.

1111
01:01:47,447 --> 01:01:50,215
They said they had insomnia
and they're already asleep?

1112
01:01:52,021 --> 01:01:55,365
Oh? They're smiling in their sleep.

1113
01:01:58,063 --> 01:02:00,648
They must be having good dreams.

1114
01:02:09,509 --> 01:02:16,509
