1
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:19,923
Soo Ah?

2
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:23,493
Dong Gu!

3
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:25,996
Why...

4
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:29,165
Why are you here?

5
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:30,233
Are you okay?

6
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,406
What am I supposed to do, Dong Gu?

7
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,492
What should we do now?

8
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:58,228
If we cannot pay back, they'll kick us out immediately.

9
00:00:58,395 --> 00:00:59,496
That's true.

10
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:02,132
If they kick us out, we don't have anywhere to go. It's annoying.

11
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,834
It's all because of him.

12
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,736
What are you going to do now?

13
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,905
Do you think I expected this?

14
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:13,076
How are we going to make that amount of money in a month?

15
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:14,344
It's insane.

16
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,680
I don't think you should worry about the money now.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,549
- What do you mean? - Dong Gu's coming home soon.

18
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:21,651
You made him get married, go on a honeymoon trip,

19
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:23,586
and owe a lot of money.

20
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,622
Are you expecting to be fine after all that?

21
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:28,058
Rest in peace.

22
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:29,225
Rest in peace.

23
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:33,897
Du Shik, can I hold Sol for a second?

24
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:34,898
Why?

25
00:01:34,898 --> 00:01:37,434
He won't beat me if I'm holding Sol.

26
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:38,435
- What are you talking about? - Please!

27
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:39,502
I'm home!

28
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:46,076
Dong Gu, please calm down.

29
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:47,544
Just listen to me first.

30
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:50,246
Don't say anything, not even a word.

31
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,619
What are you doing? Come in.

32
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,054
Did you bring someone?

33
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:04,127
Soo Ah?

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,371
("The Girl We Loved")

35
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:27,650
Don't think about anything today. Just rest.

36
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,287
Dong Gu, I don't think I should do this.

37
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:34,924
I feel guilty to do this to you.

38
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,528
- I'll go now. - Min Soo Ah.

39
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,431
You said you have nowhere to go. Where are you going this late?

40
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:42,932
If you really want to leave, do it in the morning.

41
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,868
Don't make me worried.

42
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:47,871
Take some rest.

43
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:02,385
What?

44
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,854
The guy Soo Ah was dating was a swindler?

45
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:07,023
He even ran away with her key money...

46
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:09,526
and tuition for studying abroad?

47
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:10,593
Yes.

48
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:13,863
It wasn't only Soo Ah who got scammed like that.

49
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:16,766
So he was a professional scammer.

50
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,768
I feel so sorry for Soo Ah.

51
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:19,969
Why would you feel sorry?

52
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:22,505
She dumped my brother. She deserves that.

53
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:24,307
How can you be so cruel like that?

54
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,443
What do you mean? She dumped you over a rich man...

55
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:27,744
and became like that.

56
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:29,646
How did she even come here with you?

57
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:30,880
Does she not feel guilty at all?

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,182
She has nowhere to go.

59
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:33,583
She could go to her parents' house.

60
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,151
Soo Ah's dad is sick.

61
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,753
He'll pass out if he finds out that she got scammed.

62
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:38,588
She was crying at the park.

63
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:40,857
Don't make her feel uncomfortable. Just be nice.

64
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:43,526
Looks like someone's feeling huge pity for her.

65
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,528
Do you still have feelings for her?

66
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:47,063
Do you want to get back with her?

67
00:03:47,063 --> 00:03:48,398
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,301
That's not what it is!

69
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:53,470
Why are you so upset again?

70
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,839
Dong Gu, I'm really sorry, but...

71
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:59,142
this tangerine is actually looking at me now. Can I have one?

72
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,978
Can you even think about eating this now?

73
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,814
What are you going to do with the landlord's money?

74
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:06,649
No matter what, you will take care of it.

75
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:09,052
Or I will kick you out. Did you get it?

76
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:10,820
I will take care of it.

77
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,021
What's going on with your voice?

78
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:13,590
Do you know what tangerine this is?

79
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,692
I'm sorry. I'll just have one though.

80
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,561
Dong Gu, did you sleep well?

81
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:19,929
No, I didn't.

82
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:23,299
Because of those red labels,

83
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:25,468
I had horrible nightmares. So I couldn't sleep well.

84
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,537
I see.

85
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:30,006
Please wait for a bit. I'll make you breakfast.

86
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:31,474
No, it's okay.

87
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:32,775
I'll just have a glass of milk.

88
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:36,446
- Here you are. - Thanks.

89
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:37,514
Ouch, it's stinging.

90
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:40,917
My lips are getting too dry. I guess it's because of how windy it is.

91
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:58,067
What are you doing? The milk is spilling over.

92
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,669
Oh, my goodness.

93
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:02,572
What were you thinking?

94
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:05,174
Nothing. It's really nothing.

95
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:06,543
This is crazy.

96
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,045
Why can't I stop thinking about that?

97
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:11,214
By the way, I made some pie.

98
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:12,348
Would you like to try some?

99
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:14,817
Oh, that was the smell of your pie.

100
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,922
That looks delicious!

101
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:21,257
- Looks delicious! - Looks delicious!

102
00:05:21,257 --> 00:05:22,325
Jun Ki,

103
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:24,627
have you looked for anywhere to get some money?

104
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,565
Look at this! It's perfectly baked.

105
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,567
This is such a beautiful pie! Yoon Ah is beautiful too!

106
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:32,468
Look at him.

107
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:43,780
What are you doing?

108
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,847
Yoon Ah!

109
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:47,216
Did you put walnut in it?

110
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,284
Yes. Why do you ask?

111
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,452
What?

112
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:51,854
I can't...

113
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:54,023
I need antiseptics!

114
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,326
What is he doing?

115
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:58,061
What's going on?

116
00:05:58,061 --> 00:05:59,662
He's allergic to walnuts.

117
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:02,198
If he eats walnuts, he gets rashes everywhere.

118
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,967
He gets a fever, chill, and even diarrhea.

119
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,802
It makes him sick for at least a week.

120
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:07,403
I didn't know that.

121
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:09,272
That's a joke.

122
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:12,275
He's being like that because I told him about the money.

123
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,345
Soo Ah, did you sleep well?

124
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,513
Why did you bring out all of your bags?

125
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:19,716
I'm going to go.

126
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:21,517
Did you find a place?

127
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:22,585
Don't worry about that.

128
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:25,788
If I sell these, I will be able to find a place.

129
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:28,891
I put it on a secondhand shop online, and someone contacted me.

130
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:29,892
I see.

131
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:31,461
Why don't you eat something before you go?

132
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,895
No, it's okay.

133
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:34,864
I feel guilty to do that.

134
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:37,300
I can't bother you anymore.

135
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,269
I'll go now. Take care, Dong Gu.

136
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:43,406
Take care, everyone.

137
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:45,308
Thanks.

138
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:46,943
Bye.

139
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:49,712
Those bags are designer products.

140
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,347
I'm so glad you guys broke up.

141
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:53,683
If you guys got married, she could have made you go completely broke.

142
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:55,151
Stop it.

143
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:59,288
I think one of them is actually what I bought for her.

144
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,991
Look at this fool.

145
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,800
Why is that person not here yet?

146
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:18,541
Hello, are you Bag Shuttle, by chance?

147
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:21,444
Are you Usain Bolt?

148
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:23,680
- Yes, that's me. Hello. - Hi.

149
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,615
Can I look at your bags first?

150
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:26,649
Of course.

151
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,886
They were my precious babies.

152
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:31,020
They are in a great condition. I guarantee it.

153
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:33,890
It looks really new.

154
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:36,159
Can I try it on?

155
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,260
Of course.

156
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:40,096
- Do you want to look at this too? - It's beautiful.

157
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:41,664
Look at its color.

158
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:45,601
I don't know what to do. I love them all.

159
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:48,771
You know what? I'll buy everything.

160
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,473
- How much are they? - Really?

161
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,041
Give me a second.

162
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:53,743
So...

163
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:56,646
Oh, my shoelaces.

164
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,249
By chance, are you a fast runner?

165
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,317
What?

166
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:03,252
I'm not that fast. Why?

167
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:04,320
Actually,

168
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,190
I used to be a sprinter representing Seoul.

169
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:09,625
I see.

170
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:12,929
The most important thing about running is how you start it off.

171
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:14,063
Look.

172
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:16,065
First of all,

173
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,768
you get into this position so that you can start running at any point.

174
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:22,338
Now, why don't you say, "Go"?

175
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:25,141
- What? - Count three and say "Go"!

176
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:26,542
- Like... - Put your hand in the air.

177
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,577
- In the air? - In the air, like that!

178
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:30,079
- High up in the air! High! - High, high, go!

179
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,284
She's really fast.

180
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:38,020
I can see that she was a professional runner.

181
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:40,156
Usain Bolt!

182
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:41,657
Where are you going?

183
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,493
Come back!

184
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:45,928
That little...

185
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,564
Stop there! Thief!

186
00:08:56,305 --> 00:09:00,910
Usain Bolt, you witch!

187
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:04,914
It's so cold.

188
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:07,717
Why do we have to meet so early in the morning?

189
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:09,619
It looks like the director isn't here yet.

190
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:13,189
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

191
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:15,091
I'm okay.

192
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,026
Hold on.

193
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:19,395
Aren't you Bong Du Shik?

194
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:22,532
Well, yes. Who are you?

195
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:24,467
I'm Mal Geum.

196
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:25,568
Don't you recognize me?

197
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:27,503
Mal Geum?

198
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,541
Yoon Mal Geum from Yujin Elementary School?

199
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,809
It's been such a long time.

200
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:34,644
I know.

201
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:37,213
You haven't changed much.

202
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,514
You're still very pretty.

203
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,317
Really? You look great too.

204
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,685
I don't.

205
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,054
Do you want some coffee? Let me get it for you.

206
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:46,556
- Take a seat. - Okay.

207
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:55,298
Writer Bong.

208
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,533
- You're early. - You're here.

209
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,268
Why did you want to see me?

210
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:01,737
The female lead has been cast for our movie.

211
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:03,906
- I want you to meet her. - Really?

212
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,708
Already?

213
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,243
Yes. She is called Cherry.

214
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,212
She is a rising star.

215
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:10,847
I'm sure you'll like her.

216
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,383
- Cherry? - Oh, she is already here.

217
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:15,985
Cherry.

218
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,887
- Good morning, Director. - Good morning.

219
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:21,424
Writer Bong, this is Cherry.

220
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:35,471
I'll be going now.

221
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,673
See you soon.

222
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,542
- Bye. - Bye.

223
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,710
Bye.

224
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:49,518
I liked your scenario.

225
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:52,455
You liked to write as a kid,

226
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:54,190
and you've become a writer.

227
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,925
Well, yes.

228
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,528
You were very mature as a kid, and you've become a pornographic...

229
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:03,266
Never mind.

230
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,035
I'll get going.

231
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,170
Which way are you going? I'm going this way.

232
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:09,972
I'm going that way.

233
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:12,141
See you again, Cherry...

234
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:13,943
I mean, Mal Geum.

235
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:16,979
Okay. Bye.

236
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:18,648
Bye.

237
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,930
It's been a long time, right?

238
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,765
I just thought of you.

239
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:39,235
Do you remember the time when you fell into the water and I saved you?

240
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:42,338
Yes, I saved your life.

241
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:44,540
Speaking of which, do you have some money?

242
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,942
I...

243
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:48,077
Hello?

244
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:50,813
That ungrateful brat. I saved his life.

245
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,214
Gosh, whatever.

246
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:54,750
You're back.

247
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:58,487
(Seized)

248
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:07,663
Why are you looking at that yearbook?

249
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,500
Yoon Mal Geum?

250
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,502
Why did you draw hearts around her name?

251
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,237
She is my first love.

252
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:16,305
Your first love?

253
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,841
She's pretty.

254
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,010
Why are you looking at her picture?

255
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,112
I ran into her today.

256
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:24,280
You did?

257
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,248
How did it happen?

258
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:29,318
We met as a pornographic writer and a pornographic actress.

259
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:30,853
Is she still pretty?

260
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,356
What is she doing these days?

261
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,993
She's been cast for a pornographic movie I wrote.

262
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:38,461
Are you crying?

263
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:41,097
Are you so happy that you met your first love?

264
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:44,667
Jun Ki.

265
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,605
Are you that happy?

266
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,574
You're so innocent.

267
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:53,142
Are you happy?

268
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,551
It's so cold.

269
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:05,921
I have no money and nowhere to go.

270
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:10,659
But my conscience doesn't allow me to go back to Dong Gu's place.

271
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,294
My goodness.

272
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,299
Usain Bolt, that witch.

273
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:23,806
Soo Ah.

274
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:27,109
- What are you doing here? - Me?

275
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:30,146
I was just passing by.

276
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,682
Oh, this is your guesthouse.

277
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,151
I had no idea.

278
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:36,852
What are you talking about?

279
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,988
You'd been coming here every day until a couple of months ago.

280
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,557
What? Well...

281
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:46,262
I have night blindness. I can't see anything at night.

282
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:47,496
Night blindness?

283
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:48,798
Since when?

284
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:50,766
Well...

285
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,369
I got it after we broke up.

286
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:54,570
I don't know where I caught it.

287
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:57,473
My goodness. Soo Ah.

288
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:00,009
You have nowhere to go, right? Is that why you came here?

289
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,144
That's not true.

290
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:05,881
It's just that I haven't found a place I like.

291
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:08,517
Fine. Stay with us for tonight.

292
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:09,819
Start looking again tomorrow.

293
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:13,022
I can't do that. I have a conscience.

294
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:15,024
I can't cause you any more trouble.

295
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:16,959
You said you have night blindness.

296
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,228
You said you can't see anything at night.

297
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:22,965
If you're so concerned, I'll stay at your place tonight.

298
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:30,773
My goodness.

299
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:40,349
Soo Ah, go upstairs and get some rest.

300
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:44,553
I blame my night blindness.

301
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:50,326
Gosh, my night blindness.

302
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:52,161
Night blindness, my foot.

303
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:54,163
Do you see how light her footsteps are?

304
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:56,098
After all that talk about conscience,

305
00:14:56,232 --> 00:14:57,466
she is back here?

306
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:58,901
It looked like she had nowhere to go,

307
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,469
so I brought her here.

308
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:01,770
Who are you trying to fool?

309
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,440
You still have feelings for her, don't you?

310
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,808
I said no!

311
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,911
Why would you talk about that here?

312
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:10,212
Then where should I talk about it?

313
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:12,348
In the kitchen? In the bathroom? In the bedroom?

314
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:14,483
- In front of your parents' place? - Stop it.

315
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,085
Have you prepared money?

316
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:19,054
Oh, this tastes great.

317
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:20,322
I knew it.

318
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:24,293
Don't eat anything until you prepare the money.

319
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,662
Yoon Ah, don't give him any food from tomorrow.

320
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:27,897
What?

321
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:29,632
Fine.

322
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:31,967
I won't eat anything, you petty scum.

323
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:35,871
I'll prepare money and throw it at your face.

324
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:37,273
Wait and see!

325
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:39,842
I'm so scared. Of course you will.

326
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:42,745
I'm so scared that I'm about to wet myself.

327
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,549
Hello. Hi.

328
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,784
What time is the birthday party this weekend again?

329
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:51,854
2pm?

330
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:53,422
Okay.

331
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:56,892
By the way, I was wondering...

332
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,228
if I could receive the payment in advance.

333
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:04,633
If you could pay me for the next two years...

334
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,068
Hello?

335
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:07,803
Hello?

336
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:13,842
Right. Two years is too much.

337
00:16:16,111 --> 00:16:17,346
Gosh.

338
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:19,281
Why is she sleeping here?

339
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:21,850
No blankets? What if she catches a cold?

340
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:24,086
Hold on.

341
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:27,256
Why do I care?

342
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:33,262
Why do I keep worrying about her?

343
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:37,866
My goodness.

344
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,302
All right.

345
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:43,072
It's just sympathy.

346
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,609
It's a bit like charity work.

347
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:52,348
I must have been out of my mind. Gosh, it stinks.

348
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:54,617
What did she eat?

349
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:59,121
- Dong Gu. - What? What is it?

350
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:00,522
Why are you so startled?

351
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:02,458
It's nothing.

352
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,027
Are you leaving?

353
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:07,496
I should. I have a conscience.

354
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,331
Do you have somewhere to go?

355
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:11,300
Yes. My friend is letting me stay with her.

356
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:15,371
Dong Gu, I'll never cause you any more trouble.

357
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:17,339
Take care.

358
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,508
Okay. Bye.

359
00:17:20,075 --> 00:17:21,176
Bye.

360
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,286
What is with her today?

361
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:32,955
Did she get a hole in her guts?

362
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:35,257
Gosh, it stinks. What did she eat?

363
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,226
My goodness.

364
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,361
Okay.

365
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:43,365
Thank you for the information.

366
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:49,305
Do I really have to do this?

367
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:52,741
My goodness.

368
00:17:58,213 --> 00:17:59,581
My gosh.

369
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,685
Why does Mal Geum have to play the female lead in my movie?

370
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:05,387
How will I face her from now on?

371
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,328
Where could Soo Ah be now?

372
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:14,063
Why can't she text me or something?

373
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,130
Hey.

374
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:17,232
Are you only worried about Soo Ah?

375
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,035
Don't you care how much I'm suffering right now?

376
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:21,203
Not at all.

377
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:23,172
Have you prepared money yet?

378
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,741
I will prepare it. I will.

379
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,242
How can I trust you?

380
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:30,079
I'd rather trust a dog passing by than you.

381
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,881
What? A dog?

382
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,018
Do you know what I've decided to do to prepare the money?

383
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,821
- What did you decide? - It's none of your business.

384
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:41,757
If I bring money,

385
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:43,292
what will you do?

386
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,494
Once you bring money,

387
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,896
I won't call you Jun Ki.

388
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:49,798
I'll call you Father instead.

389
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,834
Instead of calling me that,

390
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:53,736
crawl under my crotch.

391
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:54,903
Race.

392
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:56,772
If you're afraid, forget it.

393
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,540
I'm not afraid.

394
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,111
I'll do anything if you bring money.

395
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:03,212
Kang Dong Gu.

396
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,748
Keep your promise.

397
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:09,284
I'll definitely bring money.

398
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:11,520
No matter what.

399
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:15,257
Act desperate in front of him.

400
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:20,662
(Judges)

401
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,399
Mal Geum, are you here for the audition?

402
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:28,303
Yes, the director told me to participate.

403
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:30,172
We're casting her male partner.

404
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:32,374
Of course, she should watch with us.

405
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:34,643
Let's get started.

406
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:39,815
(Audition for "Goodbye Sister-in-law")

407
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:43,919
Hello, I'm Terminator in eroticism.

408
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,689
I'm the king of touch. I'm Deok Cheol.

409
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,728
He has a great body. What do you think, Writer Bong?

410
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:55,097
Wouldn't he look good with Cherry?

411
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:57,065
Pardon? Wait.

412
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:59,334
Is the actor who gets cast today...

413
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,503
shooting an erotic scene with Mal Geum?

414
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:03,639
With my precious first love?

415
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:05,240
What do you think, Writer Bong?

416
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,943
Pardon? Well, I think...

417
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:13,048
Everything is good except...

418
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:14,750
that his legs are bowlegged.

419
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:18,487
I can't deliver the message that I intended with bowlegs.

420
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,723
Really? What message did you intend?

421
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:24,426
A correct mindset.

422
00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:27,362
Was there a message like that in our movie?

423
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:28,363
Yes.

424
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,701
Everything is good except...

425
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,169
his thick double eyelids.

426
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:35,838
They don't agree with my intention.

427
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:37,639
Next person.

428
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,941
Do you want some milk?

429
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:40,943
Everything is good except...

430
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:42,711
his collarbones are protruding.

431
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:44,146
They don't match the role.

432
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,452
You're much more particular than I thought.

433
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,556
I don't see anyone perfect for the role.

434
00:20:58,494 --> 00:20:59,595
Hello.

435
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:01,997
I'm a new actor who will take charge in erotic film.

436
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,400
I'm Lee Jun Ki.

437
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:07,536
Jun Ki.

438
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:09,605
Du Shik.

439
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:23,919
Are you saying that...

440
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:26,788
you've been writing scripts for erotic films?

441
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:30,692
Are you the one who wrote those barbaric scripts?

442
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:35,063
You said that you write for humanistic movies about family love.

443
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:38,000
- It's true. - How is it true?

444
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:40,702
"Goodbye Sister-in-law"?

445
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:42,638
You're right.

446
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:44,706
What brings you here?

447
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:45,874
I...

448
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:47,976
I need to earn money.

449
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,979
Dong Gu gives me such a hard time.

450
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,948
I'll do whatever it takes...

451
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:56,251
to make money and throw it at Dong Gu's face.

452
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:59,555
Let's keep it a secret that we saw each other.

453
00:21:59,555 --> 00:22:00,656
That's what I want too.

454
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:04,059
Let's keep this a secret until we die.

455
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:08,864
Thank you for your work during the audition.

456
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:10,866
Let's discuss.

457
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:11,900
I think...

458
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:15,938
Lee Jun Ki was the best. What do you think?

459
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:17,873
What? Jun Ki?

460
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:19,875
I liked Lee Jun Ki the best.

461
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,376
His acting was most dependable.

462
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:24,880
There's a beauty of corruption in his look.

463
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,082
He's born to be in erotic films.

464
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:29,484
- Writer Bong. - Yes? Listen...

465
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:32,321
If you have no problem, let's cast him.

466
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:34,056
We have to start shooting soon.

467
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:36,124
Okay? Okay.

468
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:38,727
- This is great. - Wait...

469
00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:42,998
Is Jun Ki the main actor?

470
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:45,801
Will Jun Ki and Mal Geum shoot erotic scenes?

471
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:47,603
No, this is impossible.

472
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:49,504
This can't be.

473
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:51,974
Jun Ki.

474
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,378
Jun Ki, what are you doing?

475
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:57,412
Can't you see?

476
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:59,181
I'm working out.

477
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,516
The director told me to get muscular.

478
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:04,086
I guess you already got his call.

479
00:23:04,953 --> 00:23:06,989
Will you really act in that movie?

480
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:07,990
Of course!

481
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,692
I'll act in the movie and get paid.

482
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:13,962
I'll make Dong Gu crawl under my crotch.

483
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,798
What if...

484
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:18,700
your parents watch it?

485
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,236
My parents? It's okay.

486
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:22,971
They like erotic films too.

487
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,172
They're very open-minded.

488
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:27,242
What if...

489
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:29,378
your future wife watches it?

490
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:31,179
My wife? It's okay.

491
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,714
I'll meet a woman who likes erotic films.

492
00:23:33,382 --> 00:23:34,683
What if...

493
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:36,418
your children watch it?

494
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:38,587
My children? It's okay.

495
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:39,888
I'll watch it with them.

496
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:41,923
Early sex education is important.

497
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:45,661
There's nothing wrong with erotic films.

498
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:48,430
It's a type of art too.

499
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,766
That's true. But still...

500
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:51,800
Just wait, and see.

501
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:53,568
Since I got the role,

502
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,604
I'll do my best.

503
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:57,272
I'll make erotic scenes...

504
00:23:57,272 --> 00:23:58,640
that will last in history.

505
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:05,347
No, this can't happen.

506
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,216
Stop it.

507
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,385
Stop working out. Stop it.

508
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:12,087
What are you doing? Stop it.

509
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:14,456
Please stop it.

510
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:23,899
I've been eating eggs for days. My breath smells like rotten eggs.

511
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:29,271
How long do I have to stay here?

512
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:34,443
(Dong Gu)

513
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:42,417
Miss, how long are you staying here?

514
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:44,753
- Did you pay additional fees? - Pardon me?

515
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:46,822
No, not yet.

516
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:48,990
I'll pay when I leave.

517
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,393
Pay what you owe up to now.

518
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,496
Do you think that I'll run away...

519
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:57,265
without paying? I'll pay right now.

520
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,907
Where's my wallet?

521
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:07,976
My wallet was definitely in here.

522
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:08,977
I'm telling the truth.

523
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:10,912
I heard you.

524
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,247
It can happen.

525
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:14,049
Let me make a call.

526
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:18,153
Hello? Is this the police?

527
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:19,287
Ma'am!

528
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:21,556
The number you have dialed...

529
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:23,492
is not available at this moment.

530
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:27,262
Soo Ah hasn't picked up her phone for days.

531
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:29,598
What if something happened to her?

532
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:31,700
Why do you care so much?

533
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,468
Tell me honestly.

534
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:35,237
You aren't over her yet, are you?

535
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,439
You still like her, don't you?

536
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:41,143
No, that's not true.

537
00:25:41,676 --> 00:25:42,978
Why are you bringing it up here?

538
00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:44,479
Why wouldn't I here?

539
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,448
Shall I do it in the veranda or to the moon?

540
00:25:46,448 --> 00:25:48,416
Forget it. Goodness.

541
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:50,852
It's not like that, you punk.

542
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:56,358
It's already time to cook. I should prepare dinner.

543
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:02,564
It's not like that.

544
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,800
Why do you care?

545
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,901
Why are you getting angry at me?

546
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:06,935
Angry, my foot.

547
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:08,703
Stop talking nonsense.

548
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:17,212
Yoon Ah, shall I help?

549
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,247
No, it's okay.

550
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:21,183
Listen, Yoon Ah.

551
00:26:22,684 --> 00:26:24,286
I hope you don't misunderstand.

552
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:25,420
Misunderstand what?

553
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,222
I'm talking about Soo Ah.

554
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,157
People help the poor...

555
00:26:29,157 --> 00:26:31,626
and poor people in Africa.

556
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:34,663
It's possible to help your ex if she's having a hard time.

557
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,897
Right.

558
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:38,433
What I'm saying is...

559
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,269
that I don't have any feelings for Soo Ah...

560
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,071
or want to get back with her.

561
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:45,540
That's not at all the case.

562
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:47,676
In case you misunderstood.

563
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:49,878
Why would I misunderstand?

564
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:51,379
Take good care of her.

565
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:56,751
Okay, I will.

566
00:26:56,818 --> 00:26:59,087
I'm going to get groceries. Do you want to eat anything?

567
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:00,555
No I don't.

568
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,924
Why are you so grumpy?

569
00:27:02,924 --> 00:27:04,125
I'll be back.

570
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:10,866
Goodness.

571
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:13,535
I guess she doesn't care at all.

572
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,172
It's not like I care about her.

573
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:19,241
I just don't want her to misunderstand.

574
00:27:19,908 --> 00:27:21,710
I'm not worried either.

575
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:25,614
Hello?

576
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:27,716
Pardon?

577
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,551
At the police station?

578
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:41,730
Dong Gu.

579
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:44,399
I'm sorry.

580
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:48,169
The police kept saying that they'd contact my parents.

581
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:50,138
I had no choice.

582
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:02,817
Get up. Let's go.

583
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:08,290
Let me go. I'm not going.

584
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:11,259
You don't have anywhere to go.

585
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,028
Follow me.

586
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:16,498
This is wrong. I can't do this.

587
00:28:17,232 --> 00:28:18,500
What's wrong?

588
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,502
I'm guilty about what I did to you.

589
00:28:20,902 --> 00:28:22,170
How can I be indebted to you?

590
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,706
It's okay to be indebted to me.

591
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:27,609
You should've been better off after leaving me, but what's this?

592
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:36,651
Stop making me worry. Let's go in.

593
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:41,589
See? Your hands are frozen.

594
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,726
Come with me.

595
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:07,916
What's going on?

596
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,673
Lee Jun Ki.

597
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:08,810
You brought it upon yourself.

598
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:12,714
Why did you come to the audition?

599
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:16,518
Do not resent me for this.

600
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,027
That's right.

601
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:33,001
It's savory.

602
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:43,878
What's going on?

603
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:46,181
What happened to my face?

604
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:49,751
What is it? Is something wrong?

605
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,587
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

606
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:55,023
Du Shik.

607
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:59,761
Gosh, you have rashes all over your face.

608
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:01,196
What should we do?

609
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:03,731
I know. I have a script reading today.

610
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:06,134
I'm shooting in a few days.

611
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:07,469
What do I do?

612
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:09,370
You can't shoot like that.

613
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:11,673
Your rash lasts for a long time.

614
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:12,941
You have bad diarrhea too.

615
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:16,077
I think you should give up the movie.

616
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:19,214
Can you speak with the director and...

617
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:21,783
- postpone the shoot for a few days? - Are you out of your mind?

618
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:24,419
Do you know what the director hates the most?

619
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,154
It's postponing his shoot.

620
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:28,723
What do I do?

621
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:31,025
What can you do other than giving up?

622
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,461
I'll talk to the director...

623
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:36,297
so that he won't sue you. Okay?

624
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:38,700
Okay. Thank you, Du Shik.

625
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,535
Don't mention it.

626
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:42,670
Where's the hair dryer?

627
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:45,840
What's wrong with your face?

628
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:50,178
I got rashes all over my face and body this morning.

629
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:51,546
Did you eat something bad?

630
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,114
Did you eat walnuts?

631
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:56,818
No, I wasn't anywhere near walnuts.

632
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:57,952
Then what happened?

633
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,488
Hold on.

634
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:04,726
You're afraid of not getting money, so are you pretending to be sick?

635
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:05,793
What?

636
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:08,863
How can you say that when I'm sick?

637
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:10,832
You were so sure that you'll get money.

638
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:12,367
I knew it.

639
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:15,103
My goodness, you.

640
00:32:16,204 --> 00:32:19,007
You're so mean. Hey, you!

641
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,576
I can't tolerate this.

642
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,546
I have to shoot...

643
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:26,347
this film.

644
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:27,448
What?

645
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:29,017
What do you mean?

646
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:32,787
I can no longer stand him looking down at me like this.

647
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:35,490
Kang Dong Gu.

648
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:37,792
I'll break you.

649
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:39,127
Jun Ki.

650
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:40,895
Jun Ki.

651
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,677
Listen, Jun Ki. You should just give up.

652
00:32:56,444 --> 00:32:59,247
No, I won't ever give up.

653
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:01,849
Didn't you hear what Dong Gu said?

654
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:04,919
You can't shoot a film while looking like that.

655
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,822
Even if I have to die on the film set,

656
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:09,724
I cannot give up.

657
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:11,192
I will not.

658
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:13,595
Goodness.

659
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,129
Just don't do it.

660
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:17,265
Why are you yelling at me?

661
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:19,968
Is there a reason why I can't be in your movie?

662
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:21,436
It's because...

663
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:25,139
it's my first love.

664
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:41,322
Do you love me?

665
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:44,359
Since when was I your first love?

666
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,994
What are you talking about?

667
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:49,864
I'm talking about Mal Geum. Mal Geum is my first love.

668
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:51,032
I know.

669
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:53,134
My nickname was Mal Geum. How did you know?

670
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:54,335
I'm talking about Cherry.

671
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:56,537
Cherry is Mal Geum, my first love.

672
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:58,439
What? Mal Geum...

673
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:01,242
Do you mean Mal Geum in your elementary school photo album?

674
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:04,078
- Is Mal Geum Cherry? - Yes.

675
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:07,582
Jun Ki, please don't be in the film.

676
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:08,683
Please?

677
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:10,618
I didn't know.

678
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:13,554
Why didn't you tell me before?

679
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:15,790
I'm sorry, but I'm still shooting this film.

680
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,092
- Why? - After shooting this film,

681
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:21,029
I have to see Dong Gu crawling under my crotch.

682
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:22,530
Otherwise, I'll die of frustration.

683
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:23,765
Jun Ki.

684
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:25,166
I got it.

685
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,336
All you need to do is take revenge on Dong Gu?

686
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,471
- That's right. - How about this?

687
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:34,709
What?

688
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,912
Jun Ki entered the military? At that age?

689
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:41,482
Yes, the military took him by force this morning.

690
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:44,886
He's been postponing his military service by dirty means.

691
00:34:45,153 --> 00:34:47,522
- What should we do? - What else can we do?

692
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,190
We have to postpone the shoot.

693
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:52,193
My goodness.

694
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,763
By the way, I transferred your pay for the script.

695
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:57,131
You should check.

696
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:58,333
Okay, I will.

697
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:04,072
She doesn't care after...

698
00:35:04,072 --> 00:35:05,873
kissing in front of people.

699
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,010
Fine, I won't care anymore either.

700
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:16,284
Hey, Dong Gu.

701
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:19,187
Why are you looking arrogant?

702
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:29,364
What are you doing?

703
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:33,334
Use that money to pay back the landlady.

704
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:36,170
Use the rest to buy snacks.

705
00:35:37,672 --> 00:35:38,806
It's real money.

706
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:41,376
Where did you get it, Jun Ki?

707
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:42,510
It's not your business.

708
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:44,779
Did you call me Jun Ki?

709
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,081
You should call me father.

710
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:50,017
Are you being serious?

711
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,720
You weren't lying, were you?

712
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,555
Kang Dong Gu...

713
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:56,124
won't be that cheap.

714
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,127
My goodness.

715
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,295
- Give it back then. - Father.

716
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,264
Yes, my son.

717
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,302
You promised one more thing.

718
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:13,574
Are you telling me to do it now?

719
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:16,077
You weren't lying, were you?

720
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:17,979
Kang Dong Gu...

721
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:19,547
won't be that cheap.

722
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:24,352
I'll do it.

723
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,621
I'll do it. Are you happy?

724
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:28,055
Yes, my son.

725
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:30,758
That's my son.

726
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,594
Come to daddy.

727
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:37,932
You worked hard to earn money, Father.

728
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:40,668
Yes, my son. Come to me.

729
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:44,439
- That's right. - Thank you for your work.

730
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:47,275
It's so difficult...

731
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,977
raising...

732
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,112
a son.

733
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:52,780
You're a bad son.

734
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:59,454
I'm your father from now on.

735
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,428
The bean stew is amazing.

736
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:08,796
It's delicious, Yoon Ah.

737
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:10,832
Really? Help yourself.

738
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:11,966
Thank you.

739
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:15,236
Don't you have appetite now that the seizure stickers are gone?

740
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:19,006
Yes, I can finally sleep after paying the landlady.

741
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,275
You punks.

742
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:23,344
You know it's all thanks to me.

743
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:25,346
Stop making a fuss, Jun Ki.

744
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:28,916
What was that?

745
00:37:30,985 --> 00:37:32,653
Please stop making a fuss, Father.

746
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:34,255
That's right, my son.

747
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:35,857
I'm sorry, Son.

748
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:38,292
"Son"? What is he talking about?

749
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:39,760
Whatever. You don't have to know.

750
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,029
- Good morning. - You're up.

751
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:45,066
What's that? Did you catch a cold?

752
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:46,200
This?

753
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,270
It prevents your cheeks from sagging. Every model owns one.

754
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,905
Who is a model?

755
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:52,673
You've never been on a runway.

756
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,942
- Be quiet. - I thought your jaw got dislocated.

757
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:59,013
Seo Jin, everything you say is so sweet.

758
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:03,217
Oh, my. Do you still have a mustache?

759
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:07,088
Don't forget to moisturize your skin after shaving to prevent damage.

760
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:08,789
Watch out for folliculitis too.

761
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,026
Gosh, the smell of cheonggukjang.

762
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:15,029
You don't like cheonggukjang?

763
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:16,597
I do,

764
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:19,000
but I prefer something light such as Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

765
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:22,637
Sorry?

766
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,675
Never mind. I'll just skip breakfast and lose some weight.

767
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,377
Enjoy your breakfast.

768
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:33,314
How can she be so cheerful?

769
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,517
She's been conned, but she looks like she's camping.

770
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,219
You can never tell.

771
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:40,221
I really don't like her.

772
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,557
Dong Gu, when are you going to kick her out?

773
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:43,691
Forget it.

774
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:45,726
She's not staying here for just a few days.

775
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:47,395
She's our long-term guest now.

776
00:38:47,395 --> 00:38:48,829
She'll pay all the fees later,

777
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,531
and she can stay here as long as she wants.

778
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,100
Your brother signed a contract with her yesterday.

779
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,036
What? Are you crazy?

780
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,504
Why did you have to tell everyone?

781
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:58,072
Soo Ah promised she'd pay for everything later.

782
00:38:58,072 --> 00:38:59,507
You're such a pushover.

783
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,375
How long are you going to let her control you?

784
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,611
A pushover? You better stop now.

785
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:06,480
Soo Ah might be a bit immature, but she is a nice person.

786
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,382
A nice person?

787
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:11,819
What's going on here? Why do you keep taking her side?

788
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:15,256
I don't want a daughter-in-law like her. Wake up.

789
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,825
What are you talking about? A daughter-in-law?

790
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:19,560
It's not what you think it is.

791
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,830
Yoon Ah, like I said before, it's really not like that.

792
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,699
I have no feelings left for Soo Ah.

793
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:28,869
- Sorry? - Hold on.

794
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:31,739
Why would you explain that to Yoon Ah?

795
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:34,408
Are you interested in her?

796
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:35,843
Are you a two-timer?

797
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:37,478
I can't accept a cheater as my son!

798
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:39,280
What are you talking about?

799
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:42,817
Gosh, stop being so silly.

800
00:39:42,817 --> 00:39:44,285
- Gosh. - We were having breakfast.

801
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:45,953
- What? - What?

802
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:47,121
That little...

803
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:49,023
Son!

804
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:52,860
How can he be so rude in front of his father?

805
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:55,029
My goodness.

806
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:57,398
Why do I keep caring about her?

807
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:59,700
I must be out of my mind.

808
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,135
I must be crazy.

809
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,711
Son, if you read while lying down,

810
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:13,147
you'll turn into a pig. Didn't I tell you that?

811
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:14,348
Stop it.

812
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:17,184
Stop it, Father.

813
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:19,720
I might run away from home.

814
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,922
- How long are you going to do this? - Well,

815
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,058
until I'm not angry at you anymore.

816
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:26,360
That's not going to happen any time soon.

817
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:30,197
Did you just glare at your father?

818
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:31,966
You rude brat.

819
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:38,172
Du Shik, we're meeting later, right?

820
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:39,373
See you soon.

821
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:42,476
Who is it? Why are you smiling?

822
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:45,012
It's Mal Geum.

823
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:46,047
Mal Geum?

824
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:49,417
Oh, you mean Cherry.

825
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:52,386
What?

826
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,922
Who are Mal Geum and Cherry?

827
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,492
Well, she and I went to elementary school together.

828
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:01,262
She used to live in the US. Her English name is Cherry,

829
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:03,197
- and her Korean name is Mal Geum. - Mal Geum.

830
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,934
- So it's a girl? - Are you getting close?

831
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:08,235
I see you're texting each other.

832
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:10,604
What are you talking about? We're just friends.

833
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:11,605
Hey.

834
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,240
Your friend can become your girlfriend, your wife,

835
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,109
and then your enemy, and you end up in court.

836
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:16,410
That's the way it is.

837
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,578
Good luck.

838
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,615
The thing is, she has definitely been on my mind,

839
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:23,918
but I'm not sure if I really like her.

840
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:26,187
It might be just because we're old friends.

841
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:27,221
How can you not be sure?

842
00:41:27,688 --> 00:41:29,390
When you like someone,

843
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,192
your heart races,

844
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:32,927
your hands and feet tingle,

845
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:36,430
and you become dazed.

846
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,966
I like being around Mal Geum, but...

847
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:40,568
What should I say?

848
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:42,536
I'm just not sure.

849
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:45,806
You're not sure?

850
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:51,412
I know how you can be sure.

851
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:53,280
Do you want to know?

852
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:55,116
What is it?

853
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:56,417
You know NASA, right?

854
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:58,385
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

855
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,255
Richard Friedman at NASA came up with this method.

856
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:04,792
He had to work on it with supercomputers for five years.

857
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,127
Really? What is it?

858
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:07,394
- Are you curious? - Yes.

859
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:15,402
(Bong Du Shik, Yoon Mal Geum)

860
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:21,542
It's almost done.

861
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:26,380
The result is out. There is an 80-percent chance...

862
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:27,815
that you like Mal Geum.

863
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:29,250
You like her.

864
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,252
You definitely like her.

865
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:32,620
Are you kidding me?

866
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,822
How can you know if you like someone by doing this?

867
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:37,691
It's more accurate than you think.

868
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,693
Now...

869
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:42,630
do you want me to check if you'll end up together with her?

870
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,498
- Yes. - Look.

871
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:47,234
Hold a mechanical pencil.

872
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:50,037
Extend the lead...

873
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:51,238
and draw a heart.

874
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,774
Now extend the lead some more.

875
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:56,143
Extend it all the way.

876
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,345
Start filling the heart.

877
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,314
Fill it up.

878
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:03,651
If the lead does not break until the heart is filled,

879
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,219
you'll end up together with...

880
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,220
Cut it out!

881
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:09,723
I must have been out of my mind to ask you.

882
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:11,659
- Gosh. - What?

883
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:12,760
Hey.

884
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,662
It's very accurate.

885
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:17,097
Hey, I'm serious. Try it.

886
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:19,433
I must have been crazy to expect anything of him.

887
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:22,036
How old is he?

(Kang Dong Gu, Han Yoon Ah)

890
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,751
Wait.

891
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,154
76 percent?

892
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:44,158
There's a 76-percent chance that I like Yoon Ah?

893
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:45,292
Is this possible?

894
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,128
No, I don't believe it.

00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:07,414
91 percent.

899
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:10,384
I haven't even met Park Myung Ja,

900
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,852
and there's a 91-percent chance that I like her?

901
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:12,920
Is this possible?

902
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,756
Park Myung Ja's pork soup sure tastes great,

903
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:19,026
but it doesn't mean that I'm in love with her, does it?

904
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:22,796
I knew it.

905
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:25,399
This is all rubbish, Jun Ki.

906
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:26,834
Why was I surprised?

907
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:39,113
Help us clean up...

I don't believe this.

Were you going to wash your face with milk?

913
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:54,862
No, that's not what I was going to do.

914
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:57,264
Then why did you fill the washbowl with milk?

915

917
00:45:00,668 --> 00:45:02,303
I love milk.

918
00:45:02,303 --> 00:45:04,972
Really? Then drink it.

919
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:08,142
What? Right now?

920
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,710
You said you were going to drink it.

921
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,012
What are you waiting for? Drink it.

922
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:15,649
I was going to.

923
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,256
Leave a drop of it,

924
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:24,959
and I'll kick you out.

925
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:29,730
I'm sorry.

926
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,732
Fine. I was going to wash my face with milk. Are you happy now?

927
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:34,134
What? Why are you so proud?

928
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:35,135
What?

929
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:36,870
What's the noise?

930
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,072
What's going on?

931
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:39,306
Look at this.

932
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:41,942
Soo Ah was trying to wash her face with milk...

933
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:43,444
we bought for our guests.

934
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:45,579
What? Why?

935
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:47,314
It's good for the skin.

936
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:48,983
It's what every model does.

937
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:52,953
Dong Gu, put it on my bill.

938
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:54,288
Are you happy now?

939
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,858
I can't believe her.

940
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:00,527
How could she try to wash her face with milk?

941
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:02,730
Doesn't she even feel sorry for cows?

942
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,699
She said it's what every model does.

943
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:07,901
Let's just go.

944
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,904
Gosh, he's such a pushover.

945
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,206
My goodness.

946
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,942
I'm sure he has feelings left for Soo Ah.

947
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:17,077
Will they get back together?

948
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,948
Dong Gu suffered so much after breaking up with Soo Ah.

949
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:22,616
It'd be great if they get back together.

950
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,385
Gosh.

951
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:27,321
She's unbelievable.

952
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,890
We struggling as is. How dare she wash her face with milk?

953
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:30,891
Stop it.

954
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:32,159
I can't.

955
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:34,194
Now we have to eat cereal without milk.

956
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:35,229
Then don't eat it.

957
00:46:36,697 --> 00:46:38,732
See? Du Shik is so upset...

958
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,134
he is sighing.

959
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,402
That's not it.

960
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:43,837
Du Shik met his first love,

961
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:46,373
and he is not sure whether he likes her or not.

962
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,275
What? How can you be not sure?

963
00:46:48,442 --> 00:46:50,911
I don't know. I'm a bit confused.

964
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:52,146
Really?

965
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:54,515
When I like someone, just by hearing his footsteps,

966
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:56,116
I can tell it's him.

967
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:58,118
You can recognize his footsteps?

968
00:46:58,118 --> 00:46:59,853
That's absurd.

969
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:00,988
I mean,

970
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:02,456
when you like someone,

971
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:04,358
you become interested in everything about that person.

972
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:06,627
In the end, you can even...

973
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:08,262
recognize that person's footsteps.

974
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:10,397
What was his name?

975
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:13,000
Did you recognize Booger's footsteps too?

976
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,968
What about the sound of him picking his nose?

977
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:18,072
Hey. I told you not to talk about him again.

978
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:19,807
Stop hitting me. It hurts.

979
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,874
It's supposed to hurt.

980
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:22,810
Take it easy.

981
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,145
You're so strong. I can't stand it anymore.

982
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:28,015
I'm sure I'm right.

983
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,784
It's already been proven.

984
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:32,086
That's absurd.

985
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:34,321
I'm telling you I'm right.

986
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:38,358
Hey. How can you know if that person likes you or not with footsteps?

987
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:40,027
- Does that make sense at all? - What about...

988
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,895
that name fortunetelling? Does that make any more sense?

989
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:43,063
Of course!

990
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:44,898
Name fortunetelling is...

991
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:47,134
Fredman's theory...

992
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,969
that's scientifically calculated by a supercomputer.

993
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,111
What's wrong? Are you okay?

994
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,545
My heart...

995
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:01,849
- My heart is... - What about it?

996
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:04,084
My heart is beating too hard.

997
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,986
What? Why?

998
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:09,223
I don't know. It's happening as soon as I saw that woman.

999
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:12,359
My heart is beating like crazy, and I can't breathe well.

1000
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:14,995
I feel electricity in my fingers.

1001
00:48:16,697 --> 00:48:20,467
This is definitely a symptom when you start falling in love.

1002
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:21,768
Love?

1003
00:48:21,935 --> 00:48:24,204
- Does that make any sense? - Why not?

1004
00:48:24,505 --> 00:48:27,374
Right, I just need to find it out then.

1005
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:28,809
Like how?

1006
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:31,745
I will find out her name and predict our future with it.

1007
00:48:32,513 --> 00:48:35,682
Finally, it's a chance to prove Richard Fredman's theory.

1008
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:37,151
Where did she go?

1009
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:39,987
She's right there.

1010
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:44,791
Why would he even think about proving that theory? He's crazy.

1011
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:47,127
Where are you going? Jun Ki!

1012
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,033
Goodness.

1013
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:54,401
Hello! Wait!

1014
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,636
I love you!

1015
00:48:55,636 --> 00:48:57,538
Please wait!

1016
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:00,340
She went up already.

1017
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:01,742
This is crazy.

1018
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:03,010
What's wrong with you?

1019
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,478
Come to your senses!

1020
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:08,048
Seo Jin, she might be...

1021
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:10,150
my destiny.

1022
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,052
You just saw her for the first time on the street.

1023
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,921
That's why I want to find out.

1024
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:16,890
I just need to know her name. Her name.

1025
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,194
What's wrong with him?

1026
00:49:27,901 --> 00:49:29,002
What?

1027
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:30,871
Why is the TV on?

1028
00:49:34,107 --> 00:49:36,176
- Oh, my goodness! - Please be quiet.

1029
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,345
Seo Jin will be really upset if she sees me now.

1030
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,547
Seo Jin went out with Jun Ki a while ago.

1031
00:49:40,547 --> 00:49:41,648
Really?

1032
00:49:41,882 --> 00:49:43,617
Oh, I didn't have to hide then.

1033
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:48,355
Goodness.

1034
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,327
I wanted to watch TV, but I had to massage my face too.

1035
00:49:53,427 --> 00:49:54,661
So I was hiding from her.

1036
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:55,929
I see.

1037
00:49:56,697 --> 00:49:58,699
Well done.

1038
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:01,935
I think that's Seo Jin.

1039
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:03,303
It's not her.

1040
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:05,038
It's Yoon Ah.

1041
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:08,642
- I'm home. - Welcome.

1042
00:50:08,642 --> 00:50:09,676
You are right.

1043
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:12,112
How did you know it was her? You only heard her footsteps.

1044
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:13,880
Oh, that's right.

1045
00:50:14,548 --> 00:50:15,882
When I like someone,

1046
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:18,185
I can find out if it's him or not by listening to the footsteps.

1047
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:26,260
What? How do I know her footsteps?

1048
00:50:26,893 --> 00:50:28,929
Does that mean I like this woman?

1049
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:34,468
Why are you looking at me like that?

1050
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:37,404
- That's annoying. - No, it's nothing.

1051
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,575
It doesn't make any sense. How can I like her?

1052
00:50:41,575 --> 00:50:43,043
That's nonsense. It can't be true.

1053
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:47,047
It must be because of my ears being super sensitive.

1054
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:49,149
Of course, that's the reason why.

1055
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:51,351
Right, there's someone else.

1056
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:55,289
Who can this be?

1057
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:57,424
- Is it a delivery guy? - Here's your package!

1058
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:59,393
Okay! I was right! It's the package delivery guy!

1059
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:01,561
- It's the package delivery guy! - Hello.

1060
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:04,298
Thank you! Thank you so much!

1061
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:06,767
- What are you doing? - I just have sensitive ears!

1062
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,535
My ears are really sensitive!

1063
00:51:09,803 --> 00:51:11,038
Thank you!

1064
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:14,541
Thank you so much, delivery man!

1065
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:20,947
Here.

1066
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:29,189
Mal Geum, I didn't know you were so good at drinking.

1067
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:32,459
I can't normally drink this well.

1068
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:33,860
But I'm really enjoying it today.

1069
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:38,465
Today is actually my birthday.

1070
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,267
What? Birthday?

1071
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:42,436
Why didn't you tell me that?

1072
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,671
I would have bought you a gift if I had known.

1073
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:45,672
It's okay.

1074
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:48,475
Drinking with me is a gift. So it's all right.

1075
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:51,678
Don't you need to have a birthday party with your friends?

1076
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:53,847
Or you could have a nice meal with your parents.

1077
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:58,485
Actually, things got awkward with my parents...

1078
00:51:58,652 --> 00:52:00,387
after starting my work.

1079
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:02,456
I haven't seen them for a while.

1080
00:52:03,056 --> 00:52:04,458
It's the same with my friends.

1081
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:12,599
Let's stop talking about depressing things and keep drinking.

1082
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:13,767
Sure.

1083
00:52:17,704 --> 00:52:18,772
Let me pour you a glass.

1084
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:24,945
Mal Geum, let me go to the bathroom.

1085
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:26,813
Okay.

1086
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:34,755
Why are you having instant noodles?

1087
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:36,823
I'm hungry.

1088
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,659
You really care so much about your skin.

1089
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,128
How can you have instant noodles?

1090
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:44,464
This is delicious.

1091
00:52:46,032 --> 00:52:47,934
I'm going to go grocery shopping.

1092
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:50,203
Yoon Ah, you said you had a lot of things to buy today, right?

1093
00:52:50,203 --> 00:52:52,172
- Let me go with you. - Okay.

1094
00:52:53,106 --> 00:52:55,175
Soo Ah, do you want to join us?

1095
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,677
No, my skin gets rough in the cold weather.

1096
00:52:57,677 --> 00:52:59,279
I'm a model, you know.

1097
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:01,715
I'll see you later then.

1098
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:03,717
I'll clean here. See you soon.

1099
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,051
Okay.

1100
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:11,024
What happened?

1101
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:13,427
Are you okay, Soo Ah?

1102
00:53:13,593 --> 00:53:14,961
I'm okay.

1103
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:17,564
No, you're not.

1104
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:19,266
You are bleeding.

1105
00:53:19,966 --> 00:53:22,169
Yoon Ah, where's the first-aid kit?

1106
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:24,137
It must be in the living room. I'll bring it.

1107
00:53:24,137 --> 00:53:26,139
No, I'll bring it.

1108
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:27,841
Yoon Ah, you can go grocery shopping now.

1109
00:53:28,575 --> 00:53:30,444
I'm sorry for not going with you.

1110
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:31,645
It's okay.

1111
00:53:31,645 --> 00:53:33,346
Please take care of Soo Ah.

1112
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:35,115
I will. See you soon.

1113
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:39,619
Soo Ah, please wait here while I bring the first-aid kit.

1114
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,392
I just need to know her name!

1115
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:48,662
Goodness.

1116
00:53:49,629 --> 00:53:51,598
That's not her. No. No.

1117
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:54,868
Jun Ki, please.

1118
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:57,137
Let's stop here.

1119
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:59,706
How can you find that woman in such a big building like this?

1120
00:53:59,873 --> 00:54:01,675
Why? Are you afraid of...

1121
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:03,977
Richard Fredman's theory?

1122
00:54:04,177 --> 00:54:06,780
Who is Richard Fredman anyway?

1123
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,881
Just wait and see.

1124
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:10,116
I'll show you...

1125
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:13,053
how scientific the name fortunetelling is.

1126
00:54:21,728 --> 00:54:23,096
"Specialist Kim Hyo Jung".

1127
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:25,599
Seo Jin, this is her, right?

1128
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:28,201
- How would I know? - It's definitely her!

1129
00:54:28,535 --> 00:54:30,003
As soon as I saw this picture,

1130
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:32,439
my heart started beating again.

1131
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,712
(Lee Jun Ki, Kim Hyo Jung)

1132
00:54:43,216 --> 00:54:44,818
It's 99!

1133
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:46,119
It's 99 percent!

1134
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,355
Look at this. Can you not see it yet?

1135
00:54:48,822 --> 00:54:51,691
Hyo Jung and I are meant to be.

1136
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:54,461
How would you know with this stupid theory?

1137
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:55,729
Kang Seo Jin.

1138
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:57,898
Why don't you just admit it?

1139
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:00,166
You are being pathetic now.

1140
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:04,704
Richard Fredman's theory is finally proven by this.

1141
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:07,474
I should meet Hyo Jung.

1142
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:08,708
Right...

1143
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:10,677
Hyo Jung...

1144
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:13,547
Hyo Jung, I'm here.

1145
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,982
Whatever, I don't know anymore.

1146
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:19,252
But why am I so curious about it?

1147
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:22,422
Please come in.

1148
00:55:23,023 --> 00:55:24,124
Hyo Jung.

1149
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,395
- Please have a seat. - Okay.

1150
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:36,303
What brought you here today?

1151
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:38,905
My heart is...

1152
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:41,408
beating too much.

1153
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:42,609
Since when?

1154
00:55:42,609 --> 00:55:44,544
Since I saw this beautiful woman,

1155
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:46,613
my heart has been beating so much.

1156
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:50,050
And I found out we were a perfect match by 99 percent.

1157
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:52,619
That made my heart almost explode.

1158
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:54,020
Anything else?

1159
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:56,656
I can't think straight.

1160
00:55:56,923 --> 00:55:58,725
My hands and feet are almost numb.

1161
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:02,128
It's like an electric shock. I can't even breathe well.

1162
00:56:02,128 --> 00:56:03,196
Really?

1163
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,931
Let me check your heart first.

1164
00:56:04,931 --> 00:56:06,600
No, you don't have to do that.

1165
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,069
- Excuse me. - What? Wait.

1166
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,442
- What's going on? - I don't know why.

1167
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,711
- Your heartbeat is... - Can you hear that?

1168
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:19,546
It's really strange.

1169
00:56:20,614 --> 00:56:22,983
Well, the symptoms don't sound normal either.

1170
00:56:23,316 --> 00:56:24,551
Let me run some tests on you.

1171
00:56:24,751 --> 00:56:27,420
Nurse Kim, please prepare him a set of medical examinations.

1172
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,888
- Wait... - Please come with me.

1173
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:30,523
What does that even mean?

1174
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:33,760
What's going on?

1175
00:56:36,129 --> 00:56:37,464
What's going on?

1176
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:40,934
Hello?

1177
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:43,470
What's going on?

1178
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,573
Sir, we will start scanning shortly, so please don't move.

1179
00:56:46,806 --> 00:56:47,874
Okay.

1180
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:49,743
What's going on?

1181
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,646
Why is this happening?

1182
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:56,383
I'm going in!

1183
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:06,259
What took you so long?

1184
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:07,894
Is the bathroom that far from here?

1185
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:09,963
Ta-da.

1186
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,264
Cake?

1187
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:13,566
It's your birthday. At least you should have a cake.

1188
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:15,635
Thank you.

1189
00:57:15,635 --> 00:57:18,571
It's okay. You are my friend. I can do this much for you.

1190
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:23,076
Excuse me.

1191
00:57:23,576 --> 00:57:25,478
Aren't you an actress?

1192
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,150
What? Yes, I am.

1193
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,186
Did you see that? I told you!

1194
00:57:34,254 --> 00:57:36,823
What did you appear in?

1195
00:57:36,823 --> 00:57:38,425
Was it a movie or a drama?

1196
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:40,060
Well...

1197
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,429
If you don't mind, we were in the middle of a conversation.

1198
00:57:43,296 --> 00:57:44,831
I remember now! I remember!

1199
00:57:45,031 --> 00:57:47,701
It was "The Bikini Squad"! It was an adult film.

1200
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:49,903
You were in that film, right? I'm right, aren't I?

1201
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:53,740
I was sure I saw you from somewhere.

1202
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,475
That's where I saw you.

1203
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:59,112
She's covered up in nice clothes today,

1204
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:01,448
but her body's actually...

1205
00:58:02,382 --> 00:58:04,350
really amazing.

1206
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:06,853
It's an honor to meet you. Can I shake hands with you?

1207
00:58:12,392 --> 00:58:13,460
Why? You don't want to?

1208
00:58:14,594 --> 00:58:15,729
Is she acting coy right now?

1209
00:58:15,729 --> 00:58:16,896
If you don't mind, we're...

1210
00:58:16,896 --> 00:58:19,299
All right. Never mind. Never mind.

1211
00:58:19,532 --> 00:58:22,602
She must think she's a big star. She's just an adult movie actress.

1212
00:58:23,203 --> 00:58:24,771
That's right. I act in adult movies. So what?

1213
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:26,406
If I appear in adult movies,

1214
00:58:26,406 --> 00:58:29,709
does that mean I have to shake hands with impolite people like you?

1215
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:33,313
She has a temper. She sure has a temper.

1216
00:58:33,379 --> 00:58:36,583
That's why she's bold enough to take her clothes off in films.

1217
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,384
What did you say? What did you just say?

1218
00:58:38,384 --> 00:58:39,786
Stop it. That's enough. Let it go.

1219
00:58:39,786 --> 00:58:41,621
Let's just leave. Let's go. Let's go.

1220
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:44,190
She's bold. She was really bold.

1221
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,725
Did you she her just now? She's so daring.

1222
00:58:45,725 --> 00:58:47,260
You think you're all that, don't you?

1223
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:57,470
How does it feel? Is it still sore?

1224
00:58:57,704 --> 00:58:58,805
No. I'll be all right.

1225
00:58:58,805 --> 00:59:01,407
We have breaking news. There was a big fire...

1226
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:02,909
at around 3:50pm today.

1227
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:03,977
There was a fire.

1228
00:59:03,977 --> 00:59:05,445
The fire caused heavy casualties.

1229
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:07,814
Wait a minute. Isn't that the supermarket in our neighborhood?

1230
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:09,682
You're right. It is.

1231
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:11,885
It must've been serious.

1232
00:59:14,154 --> 00:59:16,356
Didn't Yoon Ah say she was going to the supermarket?

1233
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:27,167
Jun Ki. Jun Ki.

1234
00:59:28,434 --> 00:59:29,736
Have a seat. Sit down.

1235
00:59:31,805 --> 00:59:34,007
What did the doctor say? How were the results?

1236
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:36,876
Apparently,

1237
00:59:38,545 --> 00:59:40,146
I have a weak heart.

1238
00:59:40,413 --> 00:59:41,481
What?

1239
00:59:41,581 --> 00:59:44,184
The reason my heart beats fast, I feel out of breath,

1240
00:59:44,184 --> 00:59:45,952
and my hands and feet feel numb...

1241
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:48,221
is all because I have a weak heart.

1242
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:50,056
- Is it serious? - No.

1243
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:53,793
I was lucky to have found out early. I'll be okay if I take medicine.

1244
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:56,462
That's a relief.

1245
00:59:56,796 --> 00:59:59,799
I was worried you might have a serious disease.

1246
00:59:59,966 --> 01:00:03,136
If you were worried, how worried do you think I would've been?

1247
01:00:03,136 --> 01:00:05,138
I was so scared inside...

1248
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:07,073
I almost peed in my pants.

1249
01:00:07,073 --> 01:00:08,241
Gosh. What was it you said?

1250
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:11,544
You thought it was love at first sight?

1251
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:13,112
I'm ashamed as it is. That's enough.

1252
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,416
But I could consider this fate, don't you think?

1253
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:18,685
If I hadn't met that doctor earlier on today,

1254
01:00:18,685 --> 01:00:21,354
you never know when something could've happened to me.

1255
01:00:21,354 --> 01:00:23,189
What could be more fortunate than this?

1256
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:24,791
Sure. All right.

1257
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,759
Say it's a gift from above, why don't you?

1258
01:00:27,026 --> 01:00:28,862
The name test is never wrong.

1259
01:00:29,495 --> 01:00:32,932
It clearly said that 99 percent meant to be.

1260
01:00:33,032 --> 01:00:35,201
I'm sick and tired of you talking about that name test.

1261
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:36,269
I think it's nonsense.

1262
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:37,537
Then you think you're right?

1263
01:00:37,537 --> 01:00:39,939
How can you know a person by their footsteps if you like that person?

1264
01:00:39,939 --> 01:00:41,541
It was...

1265
01:00:41,741 --> 01:00:43,409
just a figure of speech.

1266
01:00:43,743 --> 01:00:46,246
Things like that name test is meaningless.

1267
01:00:46,246 --> 01:00:48,014
I think it's the same for anyone who has feelings for someone.

1268
01:00:48,047 --> 01:00:50,550
(Fire Breaks Out at a Huam-dong Supermarket)

1269
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,252
My goodness. People must've been injured.

1270
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:56,189
(Fire Breaks Out at a Huam-dong Supermarket)

1271
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,827
You can't stop thinking about that person all day long.

1272
01:01:02,128 --> 01:01:03,296
Dong Gu.

1273
01:01:03,563 --> 01:01:04,764
Where are you going?

1274
01:01:14,908 --> 01:01:17,911
You worry about that person if they leave your sight.

1275
01:01:31,457 --> 01:01:33,626
If you see that person having a hard time,

1276
01:01:33,993 --> 01:01:35,461
it hurts you more.

1277
01:01:52,178 --> 01:01:53,446
You jerk!

1278
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:56,149
Who are you to say something awful like that to her?

1279
01:01:56,149 --> 01:01:57,884
Let go of me! Let go!

1280
01:01:58,051 --> 01:01:59,452
Even if you might get injured,

1281
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,622
you feel like you could do anything for that person.

1282
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:08,194
Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

1283
01:02:08,428 --> 01:02:09,495
You can't go past here. It's dangerous.

1284
01:02:09,562 --> 01:02:11,497
Get out of my way. Someone I know is in there.

1285
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:12,665
I'm telling you, it's too dangerous.

1286
01:02:12,665 --> 01:02:14,367
I don't care! Get out of my way!

1287
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:16,269
Yoon Ah! Yoon Ah!

1288
01:02:16,602 --> 01:02:17,670
Yoon Ah!

1289
01:02:18,471 --> 01:02:19,639
Dong Gu.

1290
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,494
Why are you here? Is something wrong?

1291
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:48,134
The fact that...

1292
01:02:48,735 --> 01:02:52,205
that person is healthy and alive...

1293
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:56,042
makes you feel happy and grateful.

1294
01:02:57,176 --> 01:02:59,345
Isn't that what you call love?

1295
01:03:33,713 --> 01:03:36,716
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1296
01:03:36,883 --> 01:03:38,284
Do I have feelings for that lady?

1297
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:39,652
I must be crazy. I'm crazy.

1298
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:41,087
Did I upset you in any way?

1299
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:44,457
Don't be mad at me, Dong Gu. I'll apologize.

1300
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,661
I thought I was having a heart attack.

1301
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:50,096
I can see right through you.

1302
01:03:50,096 --> 01:03:52,298
- You're going on a blind date. - What?

1303
01:03:52,298 --> 01:03:54,967
These are items from the 2017 Fall Winter Vintage Collection.

1304
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:56,169
You look like a bum dressed warmly.

1305
01:03:56,169 --> 01:03:57,170
Did you call me a bum?

1306
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:58,871
People can't seem to keep their eyes off me.

1307
01:03:58,871 --> 01:04:00,573
Excuse me. You have money, right?

1308
01:04:00,573 --> 01:04:01,808
What are you doing?

1309
01:04:01,908 --> 01:04:03,376
What? You need a replacement for a blind date?

1310
01:04:03,376 --> 01:04:04,944
Hold on. Isn't that Seo Jin?

1311
01:04:04,944 --> 01:04:07,547
We will now begin Ms. Cherry's fan meeting.

1312
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:09,882
Cherry! Cherry! Cherry!

1313
01:04:09,882 --> 01:04:11,084
You felt awkward, didn't you?

1314
01:04:11,084 --> 01:04:12,718
I refuse to shoot this film like this.

1315
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:14,053
Don't ever contact Mal Geum.

1316
01:04:14,053 --> 01:04:15,555
Then you'll have to pay the penalty for her.

1317
01:04:15,555 --> 01:04:16,722
I think I'm in big trouble.

1318
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:18,391
When you need big money like that in a short time,

1319
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:19,792
this is the only place to turn to.

1320
01:04:21,594 --> 01:04:24,330
Does this mean we won the money? We hit the jackpot!
