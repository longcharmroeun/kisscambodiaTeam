3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,010
Good work today.
See you all tomorrow.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,573
- Thank you.
- Sung Bin!

5
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,835
Sung Bin, Sung Bin!

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,875
- Please give me your autograph!
- Can I get a picture?

7
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:25,435
You're so good looking!

8
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,600
Excuse me.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,545
Yes?

10
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:33,164
Can you...

11
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:35,189
Yes?

12
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:37,768
take a photo of me with Sung Bin?

13
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:41,402
Ah, sure.

14
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,118
I'm going to take it now.

15
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:50,279
One, two, three.

16
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:53,676
Thank you.

17
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,712
Joon Ki, let's watch
a movie this weekend.

18
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:09,513
The movie I want to watch was released.

19
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:12,183
It's been a long time
since last we went on a date.

20
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:13,400
Sure.

21
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:17,263
What is it? Is something wrong?

22
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:19,537
Well...

23
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:21,846
I thought once the drama aired

24
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:25,112
people would recognize me
and I'd have fans.

25
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:27,046
Nothing has changed at all.

26
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:30,287
Well, I'm sure you'll get fans soon.

27
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,855
Will that day ever come?

28
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:34,650
<i>We're home.</i>

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,487
- Did you go grocery shopping?
- Yes.

30
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:40,459
Wow, you two seem like a newlywed couple.

31
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,977
What do you mean a newlywed couple?
That's a bit overboard.

32
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:46,757
I know. What a thing to say.

33
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:49,316
Gosh, you two are so happy.
You are just so happy.

34
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:53,516
Wait, then is Dong Gu
going to be Sol's dad?

35
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:56,522
Sol's father, Solfa!

36
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,337
What do you mean Sol's dad? Come on!

37
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,644
You're going too far.

38
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:05,277
Tell me about it.
Is there nothing you won't say, Joon Ki?

39
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:07,906
Oh, you two look so happy.

40
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,056
What is that, Yoon Ah?

41
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:12,262
Oh yeah. It's a package for Joon Ki.

42
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:15,372
- There's no return address though.
- Really?

43
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,010
Who could have sent it?

44
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,132
What... what is this?

45
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:27,901
<i>[Joon Ki, I love you.]</i>

46
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,122
What is it?

47
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:31,562
Oh my! What is that?

48
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,050
Is that blood?

49
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:36,832
Yeah, I think so.

50
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:40,606
Yes, hello?

51
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:41,967
<i>Joon Ki...</i>

52
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:46,025
<i>Did you receive the present I sent you?</i>

53
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:47,598
Present?

54
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:52,878
By any chance...

55
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,301
Who are you?

56
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,723
It's me, Jin Joo.

57
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:00,413
Joon Ki, don't you know me?

58
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,963
Jin Joo?

59
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:04,294
It's my first time hearing that name.

60
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,122
<i>What did you say?</i>

61
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:10,515
How? How could you not know me? How?

62
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:15,397
<i>I'm always thinking of you
and watching over you.</i>

63
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:17,592
You're too much!

64
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:23,437
What was that?

65
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,185
What happened? Who was that?

66
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:27,343
I think it was the person who sent this.

67
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:28,575
- What?
- What?

68
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,866
Then she even knew your number?

69
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,419
Is she a stalker, then?

70
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,305
You know, fans who get overly obsessed.

71
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:37,960
Then, I have a fan too?

72
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,848
Is that something to be happy about?

73
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:42,872
Joon Ki, you should report it to
the police before something happens.

74
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:44,604
Why bother reporting something like this?

75
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:46,477
Don't bother.

76
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,454
She's a fan.
She says she loves me. It's okay.

77
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:51,675
Hello. Is this the police?

78
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:53,395
<i>[Stalker]</i>

79
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:56,455
Look at your driving.
Hey, your driving is...

80
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:59,257
- Gosh, no.
- Wow, you really suck.

81
00:03:59,257 --> 00:04:01,540
Fire in the hole. Oh!

82
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,842
Banana, banana, banana.

83
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,475
- It's coming!
- Geez.

84
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:07,893
Hey, aren't you being too much?

85
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:11,183
How could you throw
a banana peel at a beginner?

86
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,606
Sorry.

87
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:19,961
I'm going. I'm winning. Woohoo! I won!

88
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,865
Hey, how can you do that
when we were talking?

89
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:26,095
The loser doesn't get to have a say.

90
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:28,485
Anyway, you lost, so go make ramen.

91
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,704
You are the king of pettiness
and sneakiness.

92
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,435
- You want to die?
- You want egg in it or not?

93
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:34,754
Never mind. I'll decide and make it.

94
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:37,283
- Tell me if you want some too, Seo Jin.
- Okay.

95
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:38,942
Make it good.

96
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,584
Why are you always picking on Doo Shik?

97
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:45,300
I don't know. Picking on Doo Shik
is the funnest thing in the world.

98
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,365
Yes, hello.

99
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,896
Yes, I understand.

100
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,036
What's that call about?

101
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:55,966
They caught Joon Ki's stalker.

102
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:02,190
We tracked her number and
found her in a local internet cafe.

103
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,591
I'm sorry, Joon Ki.

104
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:09,367
I did it because I like you so much.

105
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,536
Because you're so cool.

106
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:18,004
I didn't have any bad intentions.

107
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:20,954
I really mean it.

108
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,971
What do you want to do?
Do you want her to be punished?

109
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:29,369
Gosh...

110
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,435
I'm only overlooking it since
you promised not to do it again.

111
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:43,379
- Okay?
- Yes.

112
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,524
Do you like me that much?

113
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:49,908
Yes, I like you so much.

114
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:53,004
I was a big fan
ever since I first saw you.

115
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,709
You were a gangster
in the film "Cold Heat."

116
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:58,336
You were a radiation mutant in
"Superhuman City."

117
00:05:58,336 --> 00:05:59,906
You were a kidnapper in "My Mom."

118
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,134
You were a driver in
"The Zither in My Heart."

119
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:05,218
Even Octopus Man in "Super Aquaman."

120
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:07,108
I've seen them all.

121
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:09,468
Really? You saw it all?

122
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,300
Of course!

123
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,598
I'm putting everything
you've appeared in on a DVD.

124
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,978
Even I don't have that.

125
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,057
You're really amazing.

126
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:22,091
You said your name is Jin Joo, right?

127
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:26,322
Jin Joo, if you want to see me,
call and come over to my place.

128
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:27,764
My address is...

129
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:30,726
Seoul, Yongsang-gu, Huam-dong 31.

130
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:35,406
Waikiki Guest House, first floor,
room next to the bathroom.

131
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:37,196
How did you know that?

132
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:41,269
That's not what's important right now.

133
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,136
What?

134
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,172
Okay. You must be hungry right now.

135
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,355
Do you want some spicy rice cakes?

136
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:49,987
Yes, Joon Ki.

137
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:51,668
Let's go.

138
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:53,797
I'm so happy right now.

139
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:03,369
Okay. Thanks, Ah Young.

140
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,124
You must be busy with work.
You're helping by modeling for us.

141
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,713
- Thanks so much.
- It's nothing.

142
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:09,478
It's nice to make money for me too.

143
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:11,951
- Su Ah, I need to use the bathroom.
- Okay, I'll take that.

144
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:13,550
Thanks, Su Ah.

145
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:19,396
What's that? What's that sound?

146
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,995
Bong Doo Shik,
is that the sound of your heart?

147
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:28,887
Huh? No, no. It's not.

148
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:32,315
Yeah right. Have you fallen for Ah Young?

149
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:34,314
You should ask her out on a date
if you like her.

150
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:36,435
No, no. A date?

151
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,367
Goodness.

152
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,646
Ah Young, Doo Shik wants
to go see a movie with you.

153
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,182
Hey, what's wrong with you?

154
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:49,067
With you? I like movies. Which one?

155
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:52,182
Anything you want to see.

156
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:55,230
Hm, then when should we go?

157
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:10,766
Mom... Mom...

158
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,766
Ah! You scared me! What is this?

159
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,084
Huh?

160
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:18,192
Jin Joo, what are you doing here?

161
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:21,144
You said I could come over anytime.

162
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:24,351
You just looked so beautiful sleeping.

163
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,713
So, I was watching you.

164
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,891
Uh... since when?

165
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,858
Last night around 12:00.

166
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:32,437
12:00?

167
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:34,059
I see.

168
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,317
I didn't know.

169
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:42,504
What's this? Why is it like this?

170
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:46,976
I just didn't like other people
next to you in the pictures.

171
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:50,133
- I changed it to my picture.
- What?

172
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,798
Why?

173
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,068
You don't like it?

174
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:02,706
No, no, no. I like it.

175
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:05,211
I like it. It's nice.

176
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,697
I'm relieved to hear that.

177
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:09,783
Gosh, why is it so noisy?

178
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,546
What? Who are you?

179
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:15,538
What is it to you?
Can't you see I'm talking to Joon Ki?

180
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:16,927
What?

181
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:33,465
Joon Ki, let's go out and have breakfast.

182
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:36,961
I prepared breakfast just for you.

183
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,851
Breakfast for me?

184
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:41,561
Okay, all right. I'll be right out.

185
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,744
Hurry up and come out.

186
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:45,158
Okay.

187
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:51,765
What's going on? Who is that scary girl?

188
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,543
Yeah, I was scared
so I pretended to be asleep.

189
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:57,371
Who is that, Joon Ki?

190
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:58,595
My fan.

191
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:02,253
You know the girl who sent me
the pictures yesterday.

192
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:05,047
Huh? You mean that stalker?

193
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,167
No, she's not a stalker. She's my fan.

194
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,083
She did it because she likes me so much.

195
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:14,230
I'm going to go eat with my fan, okay?

196
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:18,111
- That's what a stalker is...
- No! Fan, fan, fan.

197
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,552
- She's a stalker.
- Don't eat it!

198
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,318
What if something happens to him?

199
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:31,029
Doo Shik.

200
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,981
Oh, you're here?

201
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:37,547
Ah Young, you look so pretty today.

202
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:40,616
Do I? I put in some effort
because I was seeing you today.

203
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:42,918
- Does it look okay?
- Yes, you look pretty.

204
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,277
You look very pretty.

205
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:48,096
Thank you. You look good too.

206
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:50,307
You must like sweatsuits a lot.

207
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:52,735
Well, yes. They're comfortable.

208
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,537
Ah, I see.

209
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:58,408
Wow, you already bought popcorn
and soda. How thoughtful.

210
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,825
Oh, yeah? Then, should we go in?

211
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,519
The movie was really fun, right?

212
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,634
Do you want to go eat something?

213
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,716
- No, I just want to go home.
- Huh?

214
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:13,174
- Why?
- Do you even have to ask?

215
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,682
You're really too much.

216
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:19,143
Huh? What's too much?

217
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:20,355
What's the issue suddenly?

218
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:22,640
Ah Young, Ah Young!

219
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,072
Sol, should we study Korean?

220
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:31,011
The first word to learn is...
daddy, daddy.

221
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay? Let's go.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,990
Try it... daddy.

223
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,434
Dad...

224
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:40,573
Sol, you're not supposed to
get distracted when you study.

225
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:44,082
Let's try again. Daddy.

226
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:48,557
Daddy. Try saying it just once.

227
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,469
What's with you?

228
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:59,221
You were excited to go on a date.
Why do you look down?

229
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:01,234
Well...

230
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,441
What?

231
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:07,116
She got angry right after
the movie and left?

232
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:08,231
Yes.

233
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:11,494
Think carefully.
You must have done something wrong.

234
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:13,033
I didn't do anything wrong.

235
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,255
I got there 30 minutes early
and waited for her.

236
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:16,804
I reserved tickets for the movie
she wanted to see.

237
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,615
I bought popcorn and soda.
We enjoyed the movie and walked out.

238
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:23,019
- Then she got mad and left.
- What could it be, then?

239
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:25,363
- Do you think the popcorn was bad?
- No.

240
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:27,754
- She ate it to the very bottom.
- Really?

241
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:29,312
Then what is it?

242
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:32,962
Then did you buy regular soda
instead of diet?

243
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:35,625
No, she even finished off my soda.

244
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,799
Really? Ah!

245
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,509
- Maybe she just doesn't like your face.
- What?

246
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:45,333
You have a face that can annoy people
if you keep looking at it.

247
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,066
- What kind of nonsense is that?
- It's not nonsense.

248
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:50,639
What could I have done wrong?

249
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,363
Doo Shik, let's play a game
and bet on ramen...

250
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:57,442
Why do you look so down?
Did something happen?

251
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,943
Well...

252
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:04,712
Gosh, Ah Young had
every right to be angry.

253
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:07,912
What for? What did I do wrong?

254
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,748
Do you even have to ask?

255
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,482
You may not be a couple yet,
but it is your first date.

256
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,696
How could you go out in sweats?

257
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:18,072
My sweatsuit? What about it?

258
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:21,797
Hey, Ah Young probably put in a lot
of effort when she went out to see you.

259
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:25,498
All you did was put on those sweats.
It makes sense for her to be mad.

260
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:29,124
I did pick out my best sweatsuit though.

261
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:32,405
Look... it's a frog.

262
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:33,712
Is it something to get mad over?

263
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,138
Yeah, it is nice.

264
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:37,542
- It's totally cute.
- Right?

265
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:42,245
Oh, you two are so clueless about women.
What will you do?

266
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:45,340
Anyway, Ah Young is
very sensitive about things.

267
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,597
You need to put in more effort.

268
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:49,123
Oh... all right.

269
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,729
Sung Bin, Sung Bin!

270
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,874
You're so handsome!

271
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,211
Joon Ki!

272
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:09,936
<i>[Milky skin, handsome]
[Lee Joon Ki]</i>

273
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:13,707
Milky skin and handsome,
Lee Joon Ki!

274
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:16,966
I love you, Lee Joon Ki!

275
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:22,403
Joon Ki, you worked really hard today.

276
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,729
Joon Ki, here's a beverage for you.

277
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,960
Also, this is a vitamin
to help you recover.

278
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,083
And this is a candy for you
to have when your sugar is low.

279
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,365
Here.

280
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:37,486
All of this... is for me?

281
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:40,245
Why would you do all of this?

282
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:41,708
Thank you.

283
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,815
Director, she's my fan.

284
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,667
You're a star now.

285
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:50,892
Sung Bin, she's my fan.

286
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,524
Mister, this girl is my fan.

287
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:00,673
Why did you ask to meet again?

288
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,625
Ah Young, I'm sorry about yesterday.

289
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,739
Sorry about what?

290
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,845
I didn't put in any effort
and went out in my sweatsuit.

291
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:11,317
Sorry.

292
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:18,107
At least you know.

293
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:20,668
Sorry, I was thoughtless.

294
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:22,897
I'll buy you something delicious
to make up for it.

295
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:25,956
There's a good cake shop nearby.
Do you want to go?

296
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,125
Yum. This cake is so good.

297
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,215
I was stressed today,
so I was craving something sweet.

298
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:33,115
Why? Did something happen?

299
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:36,095
I had something annoying
happen at work today.

300
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:39,702
My senior kept making me do her job
and she was doing nothing.

301
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:41,666
Oh, really?

302
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,778
I was really annoyed today
because of a shopping mall customer.

303
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,466
She wanted to return clothing
that she ripped accidentally.

304
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:48,495
So absurd.

305
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:51,428
People like that exist?
How hard for you.

306
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:54,212
No, things like that always happen.

307
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:57,083
You're done with your coffee.
I'll refill it for you.

308
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,731
It's okay. I want to go.

309
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:00,754
Huh?

310
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:04,225
What's the problem suddenly?
Did I do something wrong again?

311
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:07,510
Do you even have to ask?
You're really too much.

312
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,542
Huh? What... what did I do?

313
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,211
Ah Young, Ah Young!

314
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:14,085
What is it now?

315
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:17,413
Gosh, Ah Young has the right to be mad.

316
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:20,364
Really? What did I do wrong?

317
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:23,224
You said Ah Young told you about
an annoying incident at work.

318
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:25,081
Why would you bring up your problems?

319
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,109
What about it?

320
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:29,229
Is that something to get mad about? Why?

321
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:34,152
Ah Young wanted you to listen,
take her side, and empathize.

322
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:38,961
Then you should take her side,
console her, or even just listen.

323
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:40,931
But you talked about
your troubles instead.

324
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:42,760
Why wouldn't she get mad?

325
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,009
Ah, is that right?

326
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:48,532
That's what it was.

327
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:51,399
- Good work.
- Thank you.

328
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,493
Thank you. Good work, everyone.

329
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,217
What are we going to do?
Are they really coming today?

330
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,971
It's Jin Joo.

331
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:06,061
Oh, she must be here to see me again.

332
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:08,709
Does she like me that much?

333
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:12,942
Jin Joo.

334
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:13,949
Joon Ki.

335
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,932
Why did you bother coming again?

336
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:19,576
Let's go. I'll buy you a warm coffee...

337
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:21,718
But, what is all of this?

338
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:23,367
Oh, this?

339
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,759
This is a fan club T-shirt for ASTAR.

340
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,759
This is my cheer stick for ASTAR.

341
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,472
I'm a fan of ASTAR.

342
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,855
ASTAR?

343
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:36,748
You liked another celebrity besides me?

344
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:41,385
You're my favorite actor,
but for singers, it's ASTAR!

345
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:43,963
Oh.

346
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,134
But you were supposed to watch
my drama with me today.

347
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,471
Oh, I know.

348
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:50,953
I'll go right after ASTAR's concert.

349
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:54,721
- There they are!
- They're coming!

350
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:59,387
ASTAR!

351
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:03,559
You're so good looking!

352
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,071
- You're better looking in real life.
- You're so handsome!

353
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,761
Okay. It's ready.

354
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,409
This should be enough, right?

355
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,762
It's almost time to air. Where's Jin Joo?

356
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:21,054
What is all of this? It looks good.

357
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:23,373
- Hey! How dare you touch that?
- That stings!

358
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:26,494
These are snacks for me to eat with
Jin Joo while we watch the drama.

359
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:29,938
So, you prepared snacks for that stalker?

360
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:33,708
Stalker? I told you she's my fan.
My fan, my fan!

361
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,684
Ah, why isn't Jin Joo coming?

362
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,692
Joon Ki...

363
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:49,779
<i>This customer cannot take your call...</i>

364
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,373
What's going on?

365
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:54,140
The drama ended. Why isn't she here?

366
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,348
She's not picking up either.

367
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,262
Did something happen to her?

368
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,662
<i>The caller's phone is turned off...</i>

369
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:08,402
What? It was ringing just a moment ago.

370
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:11,012
Why is it turned off now?

371
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:15,284
It can't be. Is she avoiding my call?

372
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:18,682
No way. It can't be possible.

373
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:23,180
No, that can't be. She wouldn't.

374
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,626
Joon Ki, what are you doing here?

375
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:41,939
Oh, we were supposed to watch
my drama together yesterday.

376
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,751
But you didn't come
and I couldn't contact you.

377
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,798
So, I came to see
if something happened to you.

378
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,096
But how did you know where I lived?

379
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:52,320
Huh?

380
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,615
That's not what's important right now.

381
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,020
Why didn't you come yesterday?

382
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,517
ASTAR's concert ran long.

383
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,173
I see.

384
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,748
Then, did you see the drama yesterday?

385
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:13,017
No, I was so tired that I fell asleep.

386
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:15,117
I see.

387
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:17,916
I suppose that can happen.

388
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,478
I downloaded the episode.
Do you want to watch it together?

389
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:23,146
Ah, okay.

390
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:25,656
Then I'll come over to your house later.

391
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:27,778
Do you want to? Okay.

392
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,707
I'll be waiting then.

393
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:31,275
Okay.

394
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:39,155
Ah Young, I'm sorry about yesterday.

395
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,736
What are you sorry about?

396
00:20:40,736 --> 00:20:44,243
You talked about something
annoying you at work yesterday.

397
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,992
I didn't listen to you
and only talked about myself.

398
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:49,215
So, you do know.

399
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,247
Do you know how upset I was?

400
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,961
Sorry, I just didn't know.

401
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,442
I'll be careful from now on.

402
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:57,282
All right.

403
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,992
You're not mad anymore, right?

404
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,323
What should we do now, then?
What do you want to do?

405
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:04,383
Forget it. I'm going.
You're really too much.

406
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,934
Why, why, why?
Did I do something wrong again?

407
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,288
Do you even have to ask?

408
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:11,868
How could you come out
without even making plans?

409
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:14,634
Isn't it basic manners to
make plans before going out?

410
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:16,797
Huh? Oh...

411
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:20,321
Sorry, sorry. I was thoughtless.

412
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,336
Then, shall we walk in the park
since the weather is nice?

413
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:25,739
The cherry blossoms are nice.

414
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:28,992
Forget it. I'm going.
You're really too much.

415
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:31,428
Why, why, why, why, why?

416
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:34,130
Why am I too much now?

417
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,836
Can't you see that I'm in high heels?
You want to go to the park?

418
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:40,019
Do you want to see me die from foot pain?

419
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:42,854
Ah... sorry, sorry.

420
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:44,857
I was thoughtless.

421
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:47,644
Then, should we go for coffee?

422
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,273
Well, we could do that.

423
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:52,375
Yes... let's do that.

424
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,701
<i>[Shiny, Shiny ASTAR]</i>

425
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:02,673
<i>Jin Joo, where are you?
Why aren't you coming?</i>

426
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:05,151
<i>We're supposed to
watch my drama together today.</i>

427
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:07,445
It's Joon Ki again.

428
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:09,326
Why is he being like this?

429
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,724
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

430
00:22:10,724 --> 00:22:12,204
<i>Are you coming?</i>

431
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:14,896
<i>Jin Joo, why aren't you replying?</i>

432
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:17,667
<i>Why aren't you replying
when you've read the messages?</i>

433
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,534
This guy is really clingy.

434
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:21,907
<i>[Joon Ki]</i>

435
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,118
Whatever. I don't know.

436
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:29,119
Why didn't you pick up?

437
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,539
Joon Ki, what are you doing here?

438
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:34,984
That's not what's important right now.

439
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:37,316
What are you doing here?

440
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:39,096
You came to see ASTAR again?

441
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:43,529
So, you broke your promise to me
because of ASTAR?

442
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,115
No.

443
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,704
I just forgot. I forgot.

444
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:50,786
I was just about to go now.

445
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,751
Is that right?

446
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,949
You were, right?

447
00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:57,132
Then, should we get going?

448
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:04,157
I prepared a present for you.

449
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:06,760
Ta-da!

450
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,615
What is it?

451
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:13,806
<i>[Only Look at Me]</i>
This is a Joon T-shirt.

452
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:20,438
This is my Joon cheer stick.

453
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:30,307
What? You don't like it?

454
00:23:31,022 --> 00:23:34,340
No, I totally love it.

455
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,115
Wow, wow!

456
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,365
Wow.

457
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:42,746
Joon cheer stick.

458
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,397
Wow.

459
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,190
<i>You call yourself a reporter?</i>

460
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,472
I'm on now. I'm on.

461
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:55,598
<i>You'd better not...</i>

462
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:56,865
Jin Joo.

463
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,554
- What are you doing?
- What?

464
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:01,663
What is it?

465
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:04,252
I'm on TV now. Why aren't
you using the Joon cheer stick?

466
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:07,459
You use it for ASTAR.

467
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:10,924
I was about to.

468
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:13,612
Yeah...

469
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:19,394
What was that? A yawn?

470
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:21,865
You're already sleepy?

471
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:25,733
You cheered late
into the night for ASTAR.

472
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:28,834
I wasn't yawning.

473
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:32,496
I was shocked by your acting.

474
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,068
That was it, right?

475
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,351
Look, I'm on screen again.

476
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,846
Wow!

477
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:49,944
Hurry it up.
What are you doing back there?

478
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:52,902
- Doo Shik.
- Let me off easy, Doo Shik.

479
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:55,047
There's no such thing in a game.

480
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:58,653
Oh, okay. I'm going to go.

481
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:01,571
I'm in first place. I'm first place.
Do you see that?

482
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:04,134
First place, first place!

483
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:07,951
I want to go. You're too much.

484
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:11,270
Ah, okay. I'm sorry.

485
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,692
I made a mistake again. I'm sorry.

486
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:17,622
I'll make you ramen
to make up for it, okay?

487
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:19,319
Let's go.

488
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:22,713
- All right.
- Let's go.

489
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,896
Su Ah, when did you get here?

490
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:30,215
Oh, just now.

491
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:32,519
- What's that?
- Huh?

492
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,739
Ah, a game.

493
00:25:34,739 --> 00:25:38,079
It's new so I bought it to play with you.

494
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,030
Let's play later, then.
I have to eat ramen with Ah Young.

495
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,079
Yeah, okay.

496
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,840
Enjoy your ramen.

497
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,876
I can play the game alone.

498
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:55,292
Oh, oh. Whoa.

499
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:01,575
It's more fun with two people.

500
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:05,740
- Su Ah, Su Ah, Su Ah.
- Yeah?

501
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,786
- Doo Shik, let's play this game.
- Wait, wait.

502
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:12,544
We can play the game later.
I need to ask you something.

503
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:14,626
Me? What is it?

504
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:16,578
Well...

505
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:19,230
I want to confess my feelings to Ah Young
and ask her to date me.

506
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,326
How should I do it?

507
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:23,527
Oh? Confess your feelings?

508
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:26,086
I think I might make a mistake
if I do it my way.

509
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:29,209
So I wanted to know
what girls like in a confession.

510
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,315
How would I know?

511
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:34,818
Hey, don't be like that
and teach me. Su Ah!

512
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:36,602
I don't know!

513
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:44,273
There is something
that girls would die for.

514
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:45,996
What should we have for lunch today?

515
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:49,035
Spaghetti? Or, it's been
a long time since we've had Chinese.

516
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:50,599
Ah Young.

517
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:54,566
Doo Shik, what brings you by?

518
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:57,442
What's with that outfit?

519
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,867
I have something to tell you.

520
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:08,730
What is it?

521
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,365
Doo Shik, what are you doing...

522
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:11,173
Ah Young.

523
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,891
Will you become my girlfriend?

524
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:21,657
Doo Shik, what are you doing?

525
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:23,803
What is it?

526
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:26,189
Is it because you're so touched by this?

527
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:29,046
Then, is today our first day--

528
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:37,781
Ah Young! Ah Young, what's wrong?

529
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,919
Did I do something wrong again?

530
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,659
<i>Where are you right now?
Why can't I contact you?</i>

531
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,938
<i>You went to see ASTAR again, didn't you?</i>

532
00:28:57,938 --> 00:29:00,249
What's wrong with this guy?

533
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:02,709
He's a total stalker.

534
00:29:11,907 --> 00:29:13,219
Joon... Joon Ki.

535
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:16,635
Jin Joo... you're just getting home now?

536
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:20,951
- How did you get inside?
- Huh?

537
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:25,974
That's not what's important right now.

538
00:29:27,414 --> 00:29:28,537
That's true.

539
00:29:28,537 --> 00:29:31,948
You haven't been
picking up my calls at all lately.

540
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:34,718
I came because I was worried.

541
00:29:34,718 --> 00:29:38,330
But... you seem fine.

542
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:42,583
- I've been busy lately.
- Really?

543
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,292
Then you probably haven't seen my drama.

544
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:49,147
Should we watch it together on demand?

545
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:51,375
- Now?
- What...

546
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,613
<i>[Look Only at Me]</i>

547
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:57,066
You don't want to?

548
00:29:57,892 --> 00:30:01,413
What? What do you mean, stalker?

549
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,284
I didn't stalk her.

550
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:07,175
Jin Joo is my first fan,
so I was just happy.

551
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:10,676
I didn't have any bad intentions.
It's the truth.

552
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,817
Jin Joo, you know how I feel.

553
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:16,528
What will you do?
Do you want him punished?

554
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:18,773
- Yes.
- No need... what?

555
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:21,136
Jin Joo!

556
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:25,268
Gosh, you didn't have anyone to stalk.

557
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:27,817
So you stalked your stalker
and got a restraining order?

558
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:31,096
I didn't stalk her.
I was being affectionate to a fan!

559
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:34,948
You were going so overboard.

560
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:38,593
Now you've lost the only fan you had.

561
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:44,267
Oh my.

562
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:46,685
He's angry now.

563
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:49,068
What a bad temper he has.

564
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,086
Where did you two go looking like that?

565
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:58,707
Min Su Ah!

566
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:02,279
What happened here? Huh!

567
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,374
What is it? What happened?

568
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,078
What? You did a tap dance and
confessed to her in a public place?

569
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:19,548
In front of her work colleagues, at that?

570
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:20,828
Are you crazy?

571
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:24,275
Don't you know that
women hate public confessions?

572
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,596
Really?

573
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:29,674
Min Su Ah! You said that it would work.

574
00:31:29,674 --> 00:31:32,606
You said that women
loved that kind of confession!

575
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:37,936
How strange. I love public confessions.

576
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:40,396
I guess other women hate it.

577
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:42,748
I didn't know. Sorry.

578
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:45,926
Is sorry going to cut it?
What are you going to do now?

579
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:48,097
You take responsibility. You fix it!

580
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:50,727
I said I'm sorry.

581
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:54,006
I'm tired now. I'm going to head in.

582
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,162
Where are you going?

583
00:31:56,162 --> 00:31:58,867
Hey, where are you going? Come back!

584
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:01,148
Hey! Come back.

585
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:08,692
- Yoon Ah!
- Oh my!

586
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:10,263
Get away from me!

587
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,784
Dong Gu, are you okay?

588
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:14,084
Sorry, I was so startled.

589
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:17,433
No, it's my fault for scaring you.

590
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:21,455
I was very late, right?
My meeting ran long.

591
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:24,835
No, I just got here after my class.

592
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:26,011
Shall we get going?

593
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:30,086
Ah, but the weather
is still cold, isn't it?

594
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:31,655
Aren't your hands cold, Yoon Ah?

595
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,439
What? I'm okay.

596
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:36,738
Oh no. Your hands look very cold.

597
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:38,676
Should I warm them up for you?

598
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:41,718
I'm the type to have very warm hands.

599
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:45,486
It's not because I want to
hold your hand, okay?

600
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:47,926
All right.

601
00:32:57,945 --> 00:33:00,342
Ah Young. Listen to me, Ah Young.

602
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:02,366
Ah Young, about my tap dance...

603
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,345
Min Su Ah!

604
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,023
This is all your fault.
Do you know that?

605
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:10,626
Sorry. I said sorry.

606
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:12,934
Why doesn't Ah Young like tap dancing?

607
00:33:12,934 --> 00:33:14,863
I like it.

608
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:16,423
So what if you like it?

609
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:19,382
Hey, hey. Get over here. Hey, hey!

610
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:22,365
I'm home.

611
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,772
You're home, Joon Ki?

612
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:28,198
Why is it so hard to see you lately?

613
00:33:28,198 --> 00:33:31,586
Sorry, it's because
I'm busy with the shoot.

614
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:33,502
I know that very well.

615
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:35,823
Do you know how long it's been
since we've gone on a date?

616
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:37,317
Sorry.

617
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:40,749
Then should we head out now
and watch a movie?

618
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:43,122
No, you'll pass out watching a movie.

619
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,218
Just go next time.

620
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:47,201
I'm really sorry.

621
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:50,079
To make up for it,
I'm finishing early tomorrow.

622
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,307
Should we go watch a movie?

623
00:33:51,307 --> 00:33:53,869
I'll make time somehow.

624
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:55,980
Really? You mean it?

625
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,359
You promise?

626
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,326
- I promise.
- You promised.

627
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,036
Oh, I'm so tired.

628
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:14,688
How can they shoot all night
without skipping a day?

629
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:17,128
I'm going to die.

630
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:18,556
It must be difficult.

631
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:23,117
Still, I'm so relieved
that I can act like this.

632
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:27,081
My body is tired,
but I'm very happy, Doo Shik.

633
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:32,266
Hi. Hi, you losers.

634
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:33,646
What are you saying, angry guy?

635
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:36,456
Are you a happy guy today?
Where were you?

636
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:40,291
I was on a date with Yoon Ah.
It was romantic.

637
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,974
Your smile is so wide
because you're so happy.

638
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:48,094
I wonder how far our Dong Gu
has gotten with her.

639
00:34:48,594 --> 00:34:51,300
You must have kissed her, right?

640
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,405
Huh? Kiss?

641
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:57,666
We already did that during that wedding.

642
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,807
That's no kiss. That was a peck.

643
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,418
Don't you know the difference
between a kiss and a peck?

644
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:05,568
Just by seeing you now,
I see you haven't kissed yet.

645
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:07,978
- Have you even held hands?
- Of course!

646
00:35:07,978 --> 00:35:10,802
We hold hands every day,
with interlaced fingers.

647
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,684
Wow, I'm proud of you.

648
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:14,489
You must be happy
with interlaced fingers.

649
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,659
Live forever with interlaced fingers.

650
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:17,927
Hey, now.

651
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:21,949
Measuring love by things like that
is so low and you shouldn't do it.

652
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:23,655
Yes, yes. All right.

653
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,340
Interlace your fingers
and have a beautiful love forever.

654
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,780
Hold on.

655
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,927
What? Then you've kissed Seo Jin?

656
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,985
- Oh.
- Did you or not?

657
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:37,634
Get up now.

658
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:40,054
Did you do that to my sister or not?

659
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,130
<i>[Dance with Elizabeth]</i>
Get up. Get up!

660
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:49,795
- Are you up?
- Did you sleep well, Yoon Ah?

661
00:35:49,795 --> 00:35:51,094
- Yes.
- What are you doing?

662
00:35:51,094 --> 00:35:54,007
It's spring now, so I'm making
some vegetable side dishes.

663
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:56,748
Oh, they look good.

664
00:35:57,795 --> 00:36:01,632
Yoon Ah, you have something on your lip.

665
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:03,916
That must have happened
while tasting the food earlier.

666
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:06,222
Not that side. I'll get it for you.

667
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:13,182
<i>It's soft... so soft.</i>

668
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:15,449
<i>It's so soft,
even when I touch it with my hand.</i>

669
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:18,559
<i>How soft will it be when our lips touch?</i>

670
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:19,967
Dong Gu, what is it?

671
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:21,967
<i>I want to kiss.</i>

672
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:24,847
<i>I want to kiss. I want to kiss.</i>

673
00:36:25,478 --> 00:36:27,449
Dong Gu, are you okay?

674
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,829
What? Ah... yes.

675
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:33,123
Ah, I was thinking about something else.

676
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:36,318
I need to go by the office.

677
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:37,414
Okay.

678
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:42,199
Shin Hyun Joon has been cast now.

679
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,099
Hiding the air gun in the bread
is possible now.

680
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:48,302
Our main character
Kang Chul is an Arab spy.

681
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:51,472
So, there needs to be a secret meeting
with Shin Hyun Joon.

682
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:54,893
Is there some fresh and new way
they can identify one another?

683
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:58,990
How about touching their glasses
and sending a signal?

684
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,632
That's too boring.

685
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:03,384
<i>[Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...]</i>
Isn't there something else?

686
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:05,931
Oh, there he goes again.

687
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,351
An idea is coming again.

688
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,992
What could it be this time?

689
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:13,300
- Kiss!
- Kiss?

690
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,202
Ah, use a kiss as the signal
to have a secret meeting.

691
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:18,932
That's very new.

692
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:20,695
Director!

693
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:22,922
Isn't this going too far?

694
00:37:22,922 --> 00:37:24,065
With what?

695
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:26,126
It's new, sexy, and I like it.

696
00:37:26,126 --> 00:37:29,146
Director, I don't think
I can work on this movie.

697
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,998
- Hey, what's with you?
- I...

698
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:33,556
will quit.

699
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:37,235
Wait.

700
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:40,394
Senior, Senior...

701
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:43,382
It's been hard
shooting all night, hasn't it?

702
00:37:43,382 --> 00:37:48,353
No, I'm thankful just to be
able to act like this.

703
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,956
Do you even have an agency?

704
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:53,009
- No. Not yet.
- Really?

705
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:56,679
- You handle your schedule and clothes?
- Yes.

706
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:02,422
You need to be managed
in order to focus on acting.

707
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:06,083
Oh, then should I talk to
the chairman of my agency?

708
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,675
What? If it's your agency...

709
00:38:09,675 --> 00:38:11,204
you mean YS?

710
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:16,268
That's a very big company.
How could I go there? It's fine.

711
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:18,617
I'll make an appointment for now.

712
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:20,297
Meet him and talk.

713
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,938
Really?

714
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:25,030
Thank you. Thank you, Senior.

715
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:27,543
I'll get going because I'm busy.

716
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,273
Thank you.

717
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,164
Thank you, Senior!

718
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:33,467
YS...

719
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:37,398
Ah, here you are Joon Ki.

720
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,311
The writer edited the script.

721
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:42,148
- An edited script?
- Yes, an important scene was added.

722
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:44,945
- Look at scene 38.
- Scene 38.

723
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:48,489
Joon Seok.

724
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:53,239
"His situation is so similar
to that of Elizabeth."

725
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:56,240
"He cries while looking upon Elizabeth."

726
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,005
Elizabeth...

727
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,092
Who is Elizabeth?

728
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,048
What's with the turtle?

729
00:39:05,048 --> 00:39:06,931
This is Elizabeth.

730
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:10,704
What? The turtle is Elizabeth?

731
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:13,275
Yeah, you start raising
a turtle this episode.

732
00:39:13,275 --> 00:39:14,289
What?

733
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,117
Why do I suddenly do that?

734
00:39:16,117 --> 00:39:20,273
The writer says the hard wall of politics
that Song Joon Seok comes up against

735
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:24,110
will be shown to the people
through the turtle's hard shell.

736
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:28,960
Your character will raise the turtle,
treat your wounds, and commune with it.

737
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,420
Commune?

738
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,516
Me... and this turtle?

739
00:39:33,523 --> 00:39:36,400
We don't have time,
so let's go shoot it.

740
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:43,757
Eliza... turtle?

741
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,079
<i>[Newsroom: Now filming]</i>

742
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,699
Song Joon Seok has enemies everywhere,
from all sides.

743
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,085
He's on his way home.

744
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:52,606
Then he sees Elizabeth
who is trapped from all sides too.

745
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:55,927
He starts crying without realizing it.

746
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,478
Do you understand?

747
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:02,163
Yes... I'll try it.

748
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:04,869
Okay, we'll start then.

749
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,726
Let's start filming then.

750
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,889
And... action.

751
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,123
Cut.

752
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:36,603
What are you doing, Joon Ki?

753
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:38,512
You need to shed tears.

754
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:40,963
Yes, well...

755
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:45,244
I can't seem to get into the scene
when I'm acting with a turtle.

756
00:40:45,244 --> 00:40:48,614
What can you do?
This is a very important scene.

757
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:54,159
Okay, look deep into Elizabeth's eyes
and you need to commune with her.

758
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:59,554
Yes, but her eyes are so small
that I can't really see well...

759
00:40:59,554 --> 00:41:03,764
Just try to look her in the eye.

760
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,364
We'll go again!

761
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:08,166
And... action!

762
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:20,650
Cut! Again.

763
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,170
Cut.

764
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:27,313
Cut, cut.

765
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:30,081
Commune, commune!

766
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:33,007
Yes, yes. Commune.

767
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,978
Cut, cut, cut!

768
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:39,900
What's the matter
with you today, Joon Ki?

769
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:54,856
Is Shin Hyun Joon really
n Arabian in your movie, Dong Gu?

770
00:41:54,856 --> 00:41:59,717
<i>I want to kiss her.
I want to kiss her. I want to kiss her.</i>

771
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:02,853
Dong Gu.

772
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:05,331
Dong Gu, can you not hear me?

773
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:09,523
What? No, I was listening.

774
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,351
Oh yeah. Yoon Ah.

775
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,469
I actually need to
talk to you about something.

776
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:18,028
Really? What is it?

777
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:22,472
Well, it's very important,
so I can't talk about it here.

778
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:25,737
Oh, should we go talk over there?

779
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:27,931
Okay, Let's do that.

780
00:42:27,931 --> 00:42:29,485
Let's go.

781
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:32,932
What did you need to say?

782
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:37,389
Ah, well I have my work with the movie.

783
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,751
It's also difficult
because we don't have many guests.

784
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:45,802
So, I think I need something
to give me energy in life.

785
00:42:45,802 --> 00:42:48,407
Oh... really?

786
00:42:49,492 --> 00:42:51,860
Be strong, Dong Gu.

787
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:54,652
But...

788
00:42:55,427 --> 00:43:00,317
hearing words alone
isn't enough to give me that energy.

789
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:03,532
Is that right? Then what do you need?

790
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:08,268
- Can you kiss...
- What?

791
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:12,163
- Can you let me...
- What?

792
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:13,967
Can you let me kiss you?

793
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,327
What? Kiss?

794
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:20,317
Then, have you been
acting this way over a kiss?

795
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:21,914
No.

796
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:24,163
This wasn't because I wanted to kiss you.

797
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:27,056
It's really because I need energy...

798
00:43:27,056 --> 00:43:28,204
I need energy.

799
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:33,545
Goodness.

800
00:43:34,324 --> 00:43:36,068
All right.

801
00:43:37,554 --> 00:43:38,918
Really?

802
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,367
Yes.

803
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,023
Oh, what do I do?

804
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:09,797
What is it?

805
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:11,288
I'm sorry.

806
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:15,163
I tend to be very ticklish.

807
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:18,065
Oh, your neck is very sensitive.

808
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:19,552
Try again, then.

809
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:36,880
Your waist is ticklish too?

810
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,215
Okay, again.

811
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:52,177
It tickles. It tickles so much!
What do I do?

812
00:44:58,324 --> 00:45:01,809
Gosh, Ah Young won't pick up the phone
or check her messages anymore.

813
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:04,829
- What do I do?
- Just give up.

814
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:07,507
No. I'll never give up.

815
00:45:07,507 --> 00:45:09,666
I really feel like we're destined to be.

816
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,891
Why does your destiny change daily?

817
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:13,030
Goodness.

818
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,706
Ah Young.

819
00:45:17,706 --> 00:45:19,342
I'm home.

820
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:23,947
Oh, you're really home early.
Should we go watch a movie?

821
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:26,103
I made an effort because of our date.

822
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:27,369
How do I look?

823
00:45:28,286 --> 00:45:30,166
Bacca...

824
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:33,684
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can go watch a movie today either.

825
00:45:33,684 --> 00:45:36,074
- What do I do?
- What?

826
00:45:36,074 --> 00:45:38,367
What is it now?

827
00:45:39,746 --> 00:45:41,373
Well...

828
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:49,918
So, you need to commune
and bond with this turtle?

829
00:45:49,918 --> 00:45:51,398
Yes.

830
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:54,780
How do you do that with a turtle?

831
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,599
I don't know.

832
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:00,389
The director wants me to
eat and sleep with the turtle.

833
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:03,668
- He says to stay together 24 hours.
- What?

834
00:46:03,668 --> 00:46:07,893
Seo Jin, let's watch a movie next time.

835
00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:11,817
You're always saying next time.
Aren't you being too severe?

836
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:13,836
I'm sorry.

837
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:17,324
I promise to go tomorrow and I'll buy
you something good to eat too.

838
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:20,563
You know that place that's
supposed to be good. Let's go there.

839
00:46:20,563 --> 00:46:24,092
You mean it?
Then you have to keep that promise.

840
00:46:24,092 --> 00:46:25,864
All right.

841
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:31,300
Now, how do I bond with this turtle?

842
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:41,844
Elizabeth, will you look into my eyes?

843
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:45,177
Let's tell each other how we feel
and commune with each other.

844
00:46:46,376 --> 00:46:48,436
Are you really going to be like this?

845
00:46:48,436 --> 00:46:51,969
Elizabeth, where are you from?

846
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:54,097
Do you have friends? What about siblings?

847
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:57,150
What's your motto in life?
What about books you've read?

848
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,831
Geez, you wouldn't understand?
What are you expecting, Lee Joon Ki?

849
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,929
I'm going crazy here.

850
00:47:06,596 --> 00:47:07,985
You're home?

851
00:47:09,802 --> 00:47:11,233
Why do you look like that?

852
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:13,010
It's nothing.

853
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,567
What's with the turtle?

854
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:18,652
Hm? It's just for something.

855
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,545
Oh yeah, Joon Ki.

856
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:23,695
I have something to ask you.

857
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:27,202
The main character in my movie
has a girlfriend.

858
00:47:27,202 --> 00:47:28,755
- And?
- And...

859
00:47:28,755 --> 00:47:32,012
The main character
needs to kiss his girlfriend.

860
00:47:32,012 --> 00:47:37,112
The girlfriend is so ticklish
that he just can't kiss her.

861
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:40,862
- So?
- How can he kiss his girlfriend?

862
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:42,612
Ah, so let's see.

863
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:45,422
Yoon Ah is so ticklish
that you can't kiss her?

864
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:48,121
Yeah, I can't even touch her--

865
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:51,478
No! I'm talking about a movie!

866
00:47:51,478 --> 00:47:54,518
Who do you think you're fooling?

867
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:57,657
What should I do? Is there a way?

868
00:47:57,657 --> 00:47:59,619
That's not a hard one to fix.

869
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:03,009
If she gets ticklish,
don't use your hands.

870
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:05,458
Kiss her without using hands?

871
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:09,119
- How?
- Put them behind your back, man.

872
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,603
Behind my back?

873
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,184
- No, that's a weird pose.
- Is it?

874
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:25,615
Then what if you hold her hair?
Hair doesn't get ticklish.

875
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:27,563
Hold her hair and kiss her?

876
00:48:27,563 --> 00:48:31,554
That's even more weird.
It's not romantic at all.

877
00:48:31,554 --> 00:48:33,943
- You can kiss her though.
- Forget it!

878
00:48:33,943 --> 00:48:37,224
I'd rather not do it then.
I'm not hell-bent on kissing her.

879
00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:39,003
What do you take me for?

880
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:41,925
What do you think?
It doesn't tickle, right?

881
00:48:41,925 --> 00:48:45,840
So, you want to kiss like this?

882
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,007
There's no other way
since you get so ticklish.

883
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:50,860
I told you before.

884
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,936
It's not because I want to kiss,
but because I need energy.

885
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:57,793
Oh, I got it. I got it.

886
00:49:14,012 --> 00:49:16,626
What is it? I didn't touch you.

887
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:18,028
It's not that.

888
00:49:18,028 --> 00:49:21,253
The air from your nose made me ticklish.

889
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:23,110
The air from my nose?

890
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,213
Aren't you too sensitive?

891
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,576
Sorry, I tried to hold it in,
but it tickles too much.

892
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:33,072
Okay, then I'll hold my breath.

893
00:49:33,072 --> 00:49:34,407
Let's try again.

894
00:49:47,215 --> 00:49:50,244
It tickles! What do I do?
It tickles so much.

895
00:49:50,244 --> 00:49:52,038
Dong Gu, I'm sorry.

896
00:49:52,038 --> 00:49:55,414
But it tickles so much.

897
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,465
Elizabeth, is it good?

898
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:12,864
You should answer me if it's good.

899
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,398
Are you going to be like this?

900
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:18,420
I bathed with you,
let you sleep on my arm, and fed you.

901
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,721
Shouldn't you listen to me now?

902
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:21,871
- Joon Ki.
- Huh?

903
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:24,570
Calm down. You seem like a crazy person.

904
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,701
- What?
- He was already crazy.

905
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:28,360
Leave him alone.

906
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,125
Why you two...
You think I want to do this?

907
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,251
Do you know what I have
to shoot with her today?

908
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:36,391
What?

909
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:38,472
You guys know the film,
"Days of Being Wild"?

910
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:41,625
You know scene where Leslie Cheung
does a mambo dance?

911
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:44,701
I have to do that dance with her
while looking at her.

912
00:50:44,701 --> 00:50:47,568
You have to do the mambo
while looking at the turtle?

913
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:48,851
Yes.

914
00:50:48,851 --> 00:50:52,309
The writer put 10 stars to emphasize
that it's an important scene.

915
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:54,219
You're really suffering.

916
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,641
What a tumultuous life you lead.

917
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:01,090
Joon Ki, you haven't
forgotten our date, right?

918
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,541
You have to remember, okay?

919
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:06,860
Don't worry. I even made reservations
at the restaurant.

920
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,639
Really? Gosh, it's been so long
since we've been on a date.

921
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,413
Gosh, not in front of the food.

922
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:23,659
I feel excited going on a date
after so long.

923
00:51:24,717 --> 00:51:27,778
Should I have worn something prettier?

924
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:30,739
No.

925
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,960
I'd better finish up and go.

926
00:51:35,463 --> 00:51:37,114
Kang Seo Jin.

927
00:51:37,114 --> 00:51:40,445
Look over all of this
and summarize it by end of day.

928
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:42,742
What? All of this?

929
00:51:42,742 --> 00:51:45,755
Yes. What? You don't want to?

930
00:51:45,755 --> 00:51:47,784
No, it's not that.

931
00:51:47,784 --> 00:51:51,360
It's urgent, so make sure
to do it all today. Got it?

932
00:51:54,315 --> 00:51:56,193
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

933
00:51:56,193 --> 00:51:58,344
How can I finish before it's time to go?

934
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:01,900
I have to go on a date with Joon Ki.
This is insane.

935
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:09,429
Hurry it up. Delete this.

936
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,911
So, did you commune well with Elizabeth?

937
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:18,311
What? Well, I tried very hard.

938
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:20,561
- Yes.
- That's good.

939
00:52:20,561 --> 00:52:23,429
Song Joon Seok has been
fired as anchor in this scene.

940
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:28,721
He's getting over his sadness
by dancing a mambo with Elizabeth.

941
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:32,275
- Okay.
- It's not important to dance well here.

942
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,623
It's how much we feel
your bond with the turtle.

943
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:36,898
You got that?

944
00:52:36,898 --> 00:52:39,070
I understand.

945
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,445
Elizabeth, let's do our best.

946
00:52:41,445 --> 00:52:44,206
Okay, let's start right away then.

947
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:46,235
Let's start filming!

948
00:52:52,815 --> 00:52:54,717
Try to look good.

949
00:52:59,074 --> 00:53:02,922
And... action!

950
00:53:33,326 --> 00:53:34,829
Cut.

951
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:38,349
What are you doing, Joon Ki?
Elizabeth keeps going elsewhere.

952
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:39,588
I'm sorry.

953
00:53:39,588 --> 00:53:42,510
I told you to bond with Elizabeth.

954
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,164
Yes, sorry. I'll try again, Director.

955
00:53:49,353 --> 00:53:53,083
Elizabeth, why are you doing this?

956
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:55,664
Please save me.

957
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:58,744
Start from where you're looking at
each other and starting the mambo.

958
00:53:58,744 --> 00:54:00,635
Yes, okay.

959
00:54:01,284 --> 00:54:03,211
Let's do this, Elizabeth.

960
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:05,726
And... action!

961
00:54:09,423 --> 00:54:10,759
Cut.

962
00:54:10,759 --> 00:54:13,170
It looks like Elizabeth
is running away from you, Joon Ki.

963
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,380
I'll try again.

964
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,731
Try sharing your feelings
and do it again.

965
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,275
And... action!

966
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:28,766
Cut!

967
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,253
Cut.

968
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:33,132
Cut!

969
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,166
Elizabeth.

970
00:54:40,163 --> 00:54:43,641
Joon Ki, are you going to
shoot this scene all day long?

971
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:46,702
We have over 10,000 NGs.
Do you know that?

972
00:54:46,702 --> 00:54:47,994
I'm sorry, Director.

973
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:51,548
I gave you time with her.
How can you not have any bond?

974
00:54:51,548 --> 00:54:54,358
Now... what will you do about this?

975
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:57,949
Elizabeth is in her shell.
What are you going to do?

976
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:01,663
What? She went in on her own.
What can I do about it?

977
00:55:01,663 --> 00:55:04,574
You're the most friendly
with her, Joon Ki.

978
00:55:04,574 --> 00:55:08,664
- Make her feel better and come out.
- What?

979
00:55:08,664 --> 00:55:10,922
How am I supposed to do that?

980
00:55:10,922 --> 00:55:12,108
I don't know!

981
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:15,032
Then let's rest until she comes out.

982
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:18,713
Of all the things
to go through in my life...

983
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:20,387
I'm sorry.

984
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:24,338
I'm seriously going nuts.

985
00:55:26,483 --> 00:55:30,443
Elizabeth, come out, would you?

986
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:34,701
I promised a date with Seo Jin.

987
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:39,164
Elizabeth... Elizabeth?

988
00:55:39,164 --> 00:55:41,733
Why are you doing this?

989
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:44,409
Come on out, please.

990
00:55:52,552 --> 00:55:54,996
Okay, I finished it.

991
00:55:58,724 --> 00:56:01,666
Senior, I'm finished.

992
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,925
- You finished all of that already?
- Yes.

993
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:06,126
You didn't do a thorough job, did you?

994
00:56:06,126 --> 00:56:10,474
I did. I didn't have lunch or go to the
bathroom, and nearly died to do it.

995
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:11,525
Okay.

996
00:56:13,525 --> 00:56:14,907
Good job.

997
00:56:14,907 --> 00:56:16,088
- Go on.
- Yes.

998
00:56:16,088 --> 00:56:17,663
See you tomorrow.

999
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:21,824
Oh, I'm tired.

1000
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:26,817
I don't know why that senior
is always bothering me.

1001
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:32,789
Still, I feel happy thinking
about my date with Joon Ki.

1002
00:56:34,753 --> 00:56:36,777
I wonder why he's not calling though.

1003
00:56:41,422 --> 00:56:45,641
Elizabeth, are you really
going to be this way?

1004
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:48,074
Come out, would you?

1005
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:50,335
Elizabeth!

1006
00:56:55,565 --> 00:56:57,168
Oh yeah.

1007
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:58,407
Gosh.

1008
00:57:00,992 --> 00:57:02,077
Yes, Seo Jin.

1009
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:04,927
Where are you, Joon Ki? I'm already here.

1010
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:07,398
Oh, the thing is...

1011
00:57:07,398 --> 00:57:09,967
I'm still on set.

1012
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:13,418
What? How can you still be there?

1013
00:57:13,418 --> 00:57:15,947
I have just one scene left.

1014
00:57:15,947 --> 00:57:19,092
We can't film it because of Elizabeth.

1015
00:57:19,092 --> 00:57:21,228
<i>Anyway, wait a little bit.</i>

1016
00:57:21,228 --> 00:57:23,206
I'll be there as soon as possible.

1017
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:26,637
Okay, but come as fast as you can.

1018
00:57:26,637 --> 00:57:29,965
Okay. I'm sorry. Bye.

1019
00:57:32,177 --> 00:57:35,083
Elizabeth, you heard that too, right?

1020
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:38,672
Seo Jin is already there waiting.

1021
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:42,067
Help me out, please.

1022
00:57:42,635 --> 00:57:44,681
Elizabeth, are you going to do this?

1023
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:48,739
If you're going to do this,
I have a plan too.

1024
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:52,001
Elizabeth, are you going to do this?

1025
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:55,896
If you're going to do this,
I have a plan too.

1026
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,664
<i>Turtle, turtle...</i>

1027
00:58:01,664 --> 00:58:04,422
<i>Bring forth your head.</i>

1028
00:58:04,422 --> 00:58:07,373
<i>If you do not do so...</i>

1029
00:58:07,373 --> 00:58:10,360
<i>I will roast you and eat you!</i>

1030
00:58:13,822 --> 00:58:15,635
Gosh, I'm going insane.

1031
00:58:15,635 --> 00:58:18,411
What am I supposed to do?
What am I going to do?

1032
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:22,789
Huh?

1033
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:27,925
Elizabeth, you're finally out.

1034
00:58:29,699 --> 00:58:32,349
Did my old style speech work?

1035
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:35,719
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Thanks for coming out.

1036
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:37,083
Oh, that shocked me.

1037
00:58:38,155 --> 00:58:39,934
What is that?

1038
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:44,313
Don't tell me... she understood me?

1039
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:45,818
What was that?

1040
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:51,320
Then have we succeeded
in communing with each other?

1041
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:54,855
Elizabeth.

1042
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,847
It works. It actually works.

1043
00:59:01,068 --> 00:59:02,873
Elizabeth.

1044
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,007
Thank you.

1045
00:59:06,353 --> 00:59:09,650
And... action!

1046
00:59:35,063 --> 00:59:37,782
Cut! Okay, that was great!

1047
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:41,469
I could really feel
your bond with Elizabeth.

1048
00:59:41,469 --> 00:59:44,599
Joon Ki, good work. That was amazing.

1049
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:46,778
Thank you, thank you!

1050
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:51,054
Elizabeth, I won't forget this.

1051
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,463
Thank you.

1052
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,300
Oh yeah.

1053
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,958
- Director, I'll get going then.
- Okay.

1054
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:04,541
Thank you, thank you. Good job!

1055
01:00:13,824 --> 01:00:16,693
What is it?
Why are you smiling like that?

1056
01:00:16,693 --> 01:00:19,934
Oh, I just met Ah Young.

1057
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:22,523
I don't think she's angry anymore.

1058
01:00:22,523 --> 01:00:24,307
Oh, really?

1059
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:27,079
So, I'm calling to ask her out
on a date tomorrow.

1060
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:30,327
<i>This customer cannot take your call...</i>

1061
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:33,050
Why isn't she picking up?

1062
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,795
<i>[Ah Young]</i>

1063
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:40,315
<i>This customer's phone is turned off.
You will be redirected to voice mail.</i>

1064
01:00:40,315 --> 01:00:43,577
Oh, why is her phone turned off?

1065
01:00:43,577 --> 01:00:45,610
It was just ringing.

1066
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:49,288
Gosh, it's obvious
she's avoiding your call.

1067
01:00:49,288 --> 01:00:51,027
<i>You will be redirected to voice mail.</i>

1068
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,099
- Why?
- Do you even have to ask?

1069
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:55,588
She's still angry at you.

1070
01:00:55,588 --> 01:00:59,429
No. I asked her,
"You're not angry, right?"

1071
01:00:59,429 --> 01:01:02,110
She said, "No, I'm not angry."

1072
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:04,349
I said, "You're really okay?"

1073
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:07,907
She said, "Yes, I really am."

1074
01:01:07,907 --> 01:01:09,563
Gosh, you idiot.

1075
01:01:09,563 --> 01:01:12,157
- You think that means she's okay?
- What do you mean?

1076
01:01:12,157 --> 01:01:14,909
When she says she's not angry

1077
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,992
it means she's very angry.

1078
01:01:16,992 --> 01:01:19,360
When she says she's okay

1079
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,447
she's saying she's not okay at all
and she's upset.

1080
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:24,449
Huh?

1081
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:28,411
So, saying you're not angry
means you are angry.

1082
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:31,568
- Saying you're okay means you're not?
- Yes.

1083
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:33,277
Why would people talk like that?

1084
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:38,182
What are you going to do,
being so clueless about women?

1085
01:01:38,182 --> 01:01:39,630
What is all of this confusion?

1086
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,369
Hey, where's Yoon Ah?

1087
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:44,378
- I think she's on the third floor.
- Yeah?

1088
01:01:44,378 --> 01:01:46,480
What's with him?

1089
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,469
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah!

1090
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:50,708
Yoon Ah! Oh.

1091
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,074
I found it. I finally found it.

1092
01:01:53,074 --> 01:01:54,543
Found what?

1093
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:56,972
A way for us to kiss.

1094
01:01:56,972 --> 01:01:59,077
You're talking about kissing again?

1095
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:04,733
I told you already that it's not
because I want to kiss.

1096
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:08,206
It's because I need some energy.

1097
01:02:09,144 --> 01:02:12,182
All right, all right. What is it then?

1098
01:02:23,141 --> 01:02:24,193
What do you think?

1099
01:02:24,193 --> 01:02:27,500
Then you won't feel ticklish from
the air from my nose, right?

1100
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:32,534
Do we really need go to such lengths?

1101
01:02:32,534 --> 01:02:36,146
Well, like I told you...

1102
01:02:36,146 --> 01:02:39,831
it's not necessarily
because I want to kiss.

1103
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:42,690
I just feel weak lately
and I need some energy.

1104
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,782
Whatever.

1105
01:02:44,782 --> 01:02:48,032
It is still our first kiss.
The mood is not good. What is this?

1106
01:02:48,032 --> 01:02:50,268
Aren't you being too much?

1107
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,679
I'm sorry.

1108
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:01,333
I couldn't think of any other way.

1109
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:03,530
I was being too childish, right?

1110
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,324
I'm sorry, Yoon Ah.

1111
01:03:06,802 --> 01:03:09,333
Dong Gu, why are you being so dumb?

1112
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,733
What? What do you mean, dumb?

1113
01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:14,967
You're not ticklish, right?

1114
01:03:15,402 --> 01:03:17,931
- No.
- Then, problem solved.

1115
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,836
We can do this.

1116
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:55,114
Tell me if you want to
kiss more in the future.

1117
01:03:55,114 --> 01:03:56,954
I'll do it for you.

1118
01:03:56,954 --> 01:03:58,746
What?

1119
01:03:58,746 --> 01:04:00,121
Okay.

1120
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,393
Then, I'll head down first.

1121
01:04:04,393 --> 01:04:05,652
Okay.

1122
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:17,559
One more time, one more time.

1123
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:19,315
One more time!

1124
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:20,630
I'm so late.

1125
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:24,130
Seo Jin must be angry.
I'd better take a taxi.

1126
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,235
Joon Ki, you're done shooting, right?

1127
01:04:26,235 --> 01:04:28,621
Just finished. Is something going on?

1128
01:04:28,621 --> 01:04:31,612
I told you before about helping you
meet my agency's chairman.

1129
01:04:31,612 --> 01:04:35,617
He's in the area for business
and he wants to meet you.

1130
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:39,291
- Now?
- I talked to him for you.

1131
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:43,572
You could get a contract
if you make a good impression today.

1132
01:04:43,572 --> 01:04:44,981
Really?

1133
01:04:46,532 --> 01:04:48,989
What? Is something wrong?

1134
01:04:49,572 --> 01:04:51,724
Well, right now...

1135
01:04:51,724 --> 01:04:54,547
- I have a date with my girlfriend.
- What?

1136
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:57,954
Hey, are you in your right mind or not?

1137
01:04:57,954 --> 01:04:59,833
You think you'll get this chance again?

1138
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:02,304
I know. I know that.

1139
01:05:02,304 --> 01:05:05,862
My girlfriend has been
waiting alone for hours.

1140
01:05:05,862 --> 01:05:10,134
I'm really sorry,
but could I meet him another time?

1141
01:05:10,134 --> 01:05:12,625
Is a date more important
than your life as an actor?

1142
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:17,402
Do you think you can sign with an
agency like ours if you lose this chance?

1143
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:21,764
You say you want to be an actor,
but you have the wrong mindset for it.

1144
01:05:21,764 --> 01:05:24,081
Whatever. It's up to you.

1145
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:46,445
<i>[Joon Ki]</i>

1146
01:05:50,224 --> 01:05:51,902
Yes, Joon Ki. Are you done?

1147
01:05:51,902 --> 01:05:54,030
Yes, I just finished.

1148
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,961
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

1149
01:05:56,961 --> 01:05:59,722
I don't think I can go today.

1150
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,728
What? Why?

1151
01:06:01,728 --> 01:06:05,688
There's this management agency
that I really want to get into.

1152
01:06:05,688 --> 01:06:09,429
The chairman there wants to meet me now.

1153
01:06:09,429 --> 01:06:10,724
What?

1154
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,001
And?

1155
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:14,782
I'm really, really sorry.

1156
01:06:14,782 --> 01:06:19,074
Seo Jin, can we have dinner next time?

1157
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:24,800
I'm sorry, Seo Jin.

1158
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,938
But it's a really
important opportunity for me.

1159
01:06:27,938 --> 01:06:32,110
<i>Can you understand just this once?</i>

1160
01:06:33,518 --> 01:06:34,990
All right.

1161
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,003
Really? Really?

1162
01:06:37,003 --> 01:06:39,157
You're not angry right now, are you?

1163
01:06:39,157 --> 01:06:41,306
No, I'm not angry.

1164
01:06:41,306 --> 01:06:42,516
<i>You're sure?</i>

1165
01:06:42,516 --> 01:06:43,726
You're okay, right?

1166
01:06:43,726 --> 01:06:46,235
Yes, I'm really okay.

1167
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,626
Thank you, Seo Jin. Thank you so much!

1168
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:50,916
<i>Then, see you later at home.</i>

1169
01:07:00,246 --> 01:07:01,864
I'm okay...

1170
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:05,221
I really am.

1171
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:08,380
I'm really okay.
