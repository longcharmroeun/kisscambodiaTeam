3
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:18,332
What have you been looking at
on your computer?

4
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:20,414
Seo Jin, you take a look too.

5
00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:25,071
What do you think of this place?

6
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:27,498
- Guest House Boulanger?
- Yes.

7
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:28,725
What about this place?

8
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,650
It's spring already.

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,941
We need to work on our
guest house interior.

10
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:35,652
So, I've been looking at places
for reference.

11
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:36,844
This place is nice, right?

12
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:39,110
Yes, the interior is nice
and I like the style.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,972
Also, the owner gives you free bread
that he bakes himself.

14
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:43,290
- Really?
- Yes.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,375
That's great service too.

16
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:57,902
Uh, Dong Gu...
I need to go out for a bit.

17
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:00,301
Now? Where, this late at night?

18
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:03,133
I just have some stuff to do.

19
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,956
- Okay. See you.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,585
Yes, Joon Ki. I'm here.

21
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:18,822
Where?

22
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,459
Seo Jin, it's me.

23
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,412
What was that? You scared me.

24
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:27,766
Sorry, sorry. Come in.

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,444
Over here.

26
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,727
By the way...

27
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:40,444
you weren't followed, right?
Where's Dong Gu?

28
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:42,659
He's at home, okay? He's at home.

29
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,463
- You're going so overboard.
- What do you mean?

30
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:48,174
Haven't you noticed that Dong Gu's
become much more perceptive?

31
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,683
We can't even freely go on dates and
I can't tell people I have a boyfriend.

32
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:54,382
What is this all the time?

33
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:56,319
There's nothing we can do about it.

34
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,349
I don't have to film this weekend though.

35
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,182
- Want to go on a date?
- Really?

36
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:02,828
You're not working this weekend?

37
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:06,388
Oh, I'm not working this weekend either.

38
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:09,179
Then, let's go on a trip.

39
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,669
- A trip?
- Yes.

40
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,838
Somewhere nearby overnight.
What do you think?

41
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:16,908
Aren't we moving too quickly
with an overnight trip?

42
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,558
What are you thinking?

43
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:22,199
We'll be in separate rooms.
You must be crazy.

44
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:24,609
Oh, really?

45
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:26,558
Sure, why not?

46
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:29,199
Let's go. Let's go that trip.

47
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,540
Let's go. Let's go for it.

48
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,330
Hide, hide.

49
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:42,758
Darn it. I lost her again.

50
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:45,312
She disappeared from here somewhere.

51
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:49,318
I know there's something going on.
I'm sure of it.

52
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,292
Kang Seo Jin, Lee Joon Ki.

53
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:58,681
I will catch you two.

54
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:06,126
<i>[Hide and Go Seek]</i>

55
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,401
<i>Hurry it up.</i>

56
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,068
<i>Get in the corners
and make it clean.</i>

57
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:13,818
Why do we clean all the time
when there are no guests at all?

58
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:19,605
Yeah, the weather's nice now,
so I'd rather go on a trip and relax.

59
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:21,425
A trip? Yeah, right.

60
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:23,456
Where would we find that kind of money?

61
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,899
Just clean.

62
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:26,907
Yes, Hyun Joon.

63
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,580
I haven't answered yet.

64
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,979
I don't think I'll be able to go.

65
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:34,252
Yes, sorry. Okay.

66
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:36,580
What was that? Not go where?

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,131
Well, the people from the baking academy
are going on a MT trip.

68
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:43,770
I said I can't go because I have Sol
and my work here at the guest house.

69
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,289
Why would you do that?
You should go.

70
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:49,284
How can you be the only one
to miss out when they're all going?

71
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,972
Yes, you should go.
We can watch Sol for you.

72
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:53,069
When is it?

73
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,201
This Saturday.
It's for one night and one day.

74
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,432
<i>What? One night and two days?</i>

75
00:03:57,432 --> 00:04:01,893
<i>So, she would be with Song Hyun Joon
for one night and two days?</i>

76
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,625
<i>That can't happen. That just can't.</i>

77
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,794
Wait, wait!

78
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:09,616
Goodness,  what can I do?

79
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,817
That MT trip and our workshop
are precisely...

80
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:15,959
at the same time.

81
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,189
Workshop? We're going on a workshop?

82
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:23,980
Yes, we worked so had doing dishes
and laundry for the guests.

83
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,639
So, I was planning a workshop
for one night and two days.

84
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,555
- Since when? You said we had no money.
- Huh?

85
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:34,704
Oh, I was only acting to surprise you.

86
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:37,127
Don't you know about surprises?

87
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:41,894
Anyway, it's too bad,
but I don't think you can go on the MT.

88
00:04:41,894 --> 00:04:43,836
It's okay. There's nothing I can do.

89
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:46,800
Okay, then you all have time
this weekend, right?

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,821
Wait! It's this weekend?

91
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:51,850
That won't work for me.

92
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,540
Why? You have something going on?

93
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,536
Oh, well... I have to work on a story
all night this weekend.

94
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:00,257
Ah, really?

95
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,382
I... I can't go either.

96
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:05,036
I have an overnight shoot this weekend.

97
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:07,788
What? So, just you two...

98
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,297
happen to have plans all night
on the weekend?

99
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:13,267
- It's true!
- Yes.

100
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:18,285
- Then what is your story, Seo Jin?
- Huh?

101
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,086
Well, it's a funeral.

102
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:22,745
What? A funeral?

103
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:25,045
But we still have a few days
until the weekend.

104
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,964
You don't know when the death will occur
so how can you write a funeral story?

105
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:29,596
Does that make sense?

106
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,086
Well, that person is on their deathbed.

107
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:36,875
They believe the death
will be this weekend.

108
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,553
My work seniors want me to be
on standby this weekend.

109
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:40,666
Is that true?

110
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,764
Yes, I told you it is.

111
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:44,985
Then I'll call your seniors and confirm.

112
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:46,355
What?

113
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:48,334
There he goes again.

114
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,035
Go ahead and do so.

115
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:55,038
Here. Go ahead. Do it, do it.

116
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,129
Okay. Should I?

117
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,040
I will call them.

118
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,394
Dial, dial. Go on and confirm it.

119
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:08,541
I'm dialing. I'm dialing.
I'm pressing call now.

120
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,052
Okay. That's enough.

121
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,872
Fine, I'll believe you.

122
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:19,052
But no one else can miss out, okay?

123
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:22,562
Doo Shik and I have to take pictures of
our shopping mall clothes this weekend.

124
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:26,083
You can do that at the workshop.

125
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,593
Anyway, we're leaving early Saturday
morning just so you all know.

126
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:31,134
- Stop complaining, okay?
- Okay.

127
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,072
- Now, clean.
- Let's clean!

128
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:39,105
<i>Hurry it up. Come on down now.</i>

129
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,473
Dong Gu, how long has it been
since we've gone on a trip?

130
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:45,324
I couldn't sleep well
because I was so excited.

131
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:47,314
- Are you that happy, man?
- Yeah.

132
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,824
Yoon Ah, where's Sol?

133
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,363
She's sleeping.
I wanted to let her sleep a little more.

134
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:53,242
That's a good idea.

135
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:55,916
Hey, are you a refugee or emigrating?

136
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:56,975
What is all that?

137
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:59,547
What else? Clothes for my shoot.

138
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:00,865
All of that?

139
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:03,752
How much do you need to shoot
that you're taking all of that?

140
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:05,663
Whose fault is that?

141
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:09,293
Who's the one dragging people there
who don't want to go?

142
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:10,682
Of course, you should take them.

143
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:13,091
Take more, take more.

144
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:16,048
Are you leaving now? Have fun.

145
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,694
- You're going to work now?
- Yes.

146
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:20,134
Why do you have a backpack
when you're going to work?

147
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:21,983
Well...

148
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,439
I have a lot to take
since I'm staying out all night.

149
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,641
It would be nice if
you could go too, Seo Jin.

150
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:33,204
Yeah, I wish I could go too,
but I have this story I need to cover.

151
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:34,752
Hey, Kang Seo Jin.

152
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:41,067
You know what will happen if you hang
around Joon Ki just because I'm not here.

153
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:46,607
I will smell incense at my own funeral.

154
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:47,908
You were going to say that, right?

155
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:52,052
All right, I'll stay 500 meters away
from him, not just 5 meters, okay?

156
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:55,363
Great. Go to work. Good.

157
00:07:57,192 --> 00:07:59,254
Oh, Sol must be awake.

158
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,591
I'll go get Sol.

159
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,521
Yes. Go get her.

160
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:07,252
<i>[Hyun Joon]</i>

161
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,536
Why is this guy calling again?

162
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:15,629
Hello. Yes, it's me, Kang Dong Gu.

163
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,259
Yoon Ah can't come
to the phone right now.

164
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:19,675
What can I do for you?

165
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:21,682
I heard you're all going on a workshop.

166
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:25,132
I called to tell Yoon Ah
to have a nice trip.

167
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:26,971
You don't need to
concern yourself with that.

168
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:29,764
Yoon Ah will go and have fun with us.

169
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:32,827
Hyun Joon, have a good time
on your MT trip.

170
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:35,335
We need to depart now, so...

171
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:40,076
I hung up while he was talking.

172
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:51,063
Yes, I'm here.

173
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,076
What? Where?

174
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,964
My three o'clock?

175
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:57,471
Where's that?

176
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:00,453
Oh, you startled me.

177
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:03,730
- You surprised me.
- Get in before someone sees.

178
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:07,456
Oh yeah. Take this cover off
before getting in. Hurry.

179
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,431
Seriously...

180
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:12,966
Is this "007" or "Mission Impossible"?

181
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:17,245
I don't know if I'm dating
or part of a spy operation.

182
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,381
Come in, come in.

183
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,043
Give me your bag.

184
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:31,034
Do we really have to go to such lengths?

185
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,697
What? It doesn't hurt to be careful.

186
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,923
What is this smell?

187
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:40,580
- The car has a strange odor.
- I don't know.

188
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,794
It's smelled funny ever since
Doo Shik and Su Ah went driving in it.

189
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:47,528
Anyway, shall we get going
on our first trip together?

190
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:53,802
- Ow!
- Seo Jin, are you okay?

191
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,586
Gosh, I'm okay.

192
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:57,511
- Joon Ki.
- Hm?

193
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:00,133
Once you make money,
can you get a new car?

194
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,591
Why? Rebecca is still strong.

195
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:04,048
See? Rebecca, are you good?

196
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,572
You see? She says she is.

197
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,958
Let's go. Let's go on our trip.

198
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:11,726
What is this? What?

199
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,979
- Are you sure it's okay?
- Rebecca!

200
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:19,626
Wow.

201
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:24,499
Ah, the weather is nice
and the scenery is nice.

202
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,599
It's even nicer because I'm with you.

203
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:30,692
Without that devil Kang Dong Gu,
it's heavenly.

204
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:32,363
I know.

205
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,390
Oh, I see it.

206
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,793
- We're here.
- Oh.

207
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:41,254
Then let me park my car.

208
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:45,754
I'm so happy.

209
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:47,892
Let's go, let's go.

210
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:50,702
This place is really pretty.

211
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,543
It's called Boulanger?

212
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,923
Even the name is pretty.

213
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:55,572
How did you find out about this place?

214
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,462
Dong Gu found it while looking for
interiors he could use as reference.

215
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:02,282
It was so pretty that I wanted to visit.

216
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:04,559
With you, Joon Ki.

217
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,513
Oh you, Bacca.
You wanted come here with me?

218
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,062
I don't know. I don't know.

219
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:12,192
- Shall we head in?
- Yes.

220
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,721
- Princess, get on.
- All right.

221
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,666
Okay. Let's go.

222
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:22,511
I really can't live without my Bacca.

223
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,063
Of course.

224
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:33,020
Director Bong, you okay?

225
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,274
I don't know. I'm so carsick.

226
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,434
That wasn't a long trip.
Why are you sick?

227
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:41,065
Stop saying that and
just pat me on the back already.

228
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:42,725
Why are you such a pain?

229
00:11:42,725 --> 00:11:44,986
Ow, ow! Gently, would you?

230
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:48,115
- I'll lose my organs.
- Okay.

231
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,120
What is this place?
Guest House Boulanger?

232
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,292
So, we're staying in a guest house?

233
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,586
Yes, why?

234
00:11:56,586 --> 00:12:00,693
Isn't it weird for a guest house owner
to go on a trip to a guest house?

235
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:02,254
A resort would be nice.

236
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,794
Resorts are so expensive.

237
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:08,974
Also, the interior here is so nice.
I wanted to take a look.

238
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,826
Yoon Ah, what do you think?

239
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,884
It's very, very pretty.

240
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:16,304
All right, let's get going.
Doo Shik, come on.

241
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:17,775
Hurry up.

242
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,909
Director Bong, what are you doing?
Get the clothes if you're done vomiting.

243
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:24,730
Hey, I'm so tired and sick.
You should get the bags.

244
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,379
Hey, should the president do such a task?

245
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,461
Don't complain and grab them.

246
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,770
What kind of
a villainous president is that?

247
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,340
Okay.

248
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:41,922
I have to look pretty for Joon Ki.

249
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:46,375
Let's see. Should I go for a sexy look?

250
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:50,307
<i>Su Ah, this must be the women's room.</i>

251
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:51,990
<i>Yes, I think you're right.</i>

252
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,840
What's this?
I've heard these voices before.

253
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,909
<i>Sol, isn't this nice?</i>

254
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:09,581
Wow, the rooms are
designed very well too.

255
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,717
Yes, it's cozy and nice.

256
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:13,552
Wow.

257
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:16,652
Oh, there's another guest here.

258
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,461
Is she sleeping?

259
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,923
Why don't we unpack for now?

260
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,610
Shall we do that?

261
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,986
Isn't this nice?

262
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:25,817
<i>What happened?
How did they end up here?</i>

263
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:28,028
<i>What's going on here?</i>

264
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:33,410
Goodness, I'm tired from the long drive.

265
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,739
Still, it's my first trip with Bacca.

266
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:39,166
I'm going to have lots of fun.

267
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,409
<i>Doo Shik, it's over here.</i>

268
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:45,961
<i>Oh, yeah? I'm so sick
that I'm going crazy.</i>

269
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:49,601
What? What's with that voice
that gives me bad feelings?

270
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,847
Should I help you?

271
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:55,292
It's fine.

272
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:59,926
The rooms are big and clean.
This is nice.

273
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,765
- Right, Doo Shik?
- I don't know.

274
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:04,134
I don't feel good, so don't talk to me.

275
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,995
Oh, there's another guest here.
He must be sleeping.

276
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:11,019
<i>How did they end up here?</i>

277
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,466
<i>Why?</i>

278
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:16,792
Doo Shik, let's unpack later
and take a look around the place.

279
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,191
I want to rest a bit.

280
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,336
Come on. You came all the way here.
Let's go outside.

281
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:24,732
- Hurry up. Come on.
- I don't feel well.

282
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,743
What is this? Why are they here?

283
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,703
Is there workshop location here?

284
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,813
I'm going crazy, seriously.

285
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:38,889
Wait... Seo Jin.

286
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:40,972
<i>Yoon Ah, Su Ah.</i>

287
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:42,565
<i>Come on out, already.</i>

288
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:44,051
Okay, we'll be right out.

289
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,711
- Yoon Ah, should we get going?
- Yes, we should.

290
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,860
Sol, want to go take a look?

291
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,626
Come to Mommy.

292
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:57,095
What happened? The workshop is here?

293
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,268
I'm going insane.

294
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:02,340
I'd better go to Joon Ki.

295
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,926
They even have a pool.
Did you bring your swimsuits?

296
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:09,405
Awesome. It's really nice.

297
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,155
- It's really nice, right?
- Yes.

298
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:13,658
- Hello.
- Here are your towels.

299
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,557
Tell me if you need anything else.

300
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:17,607
Yes, thank you.

301
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:20,736
Your guest house is so beautiful.

302
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,945
Oh, thank you.

303
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:26,568
Do you operate this large place
all on your own?

304
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:28,856
I didn't see any staff around.

305
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,524
Labor costs are high,
so I run it with my wife.

306
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:35,804
Actually, we also run
a guest house in Seoul.

307
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:36,846
Really?

308
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:41,221
You have a guest house and you came
on a trip to a guest house?

309
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:43,403
Pardon? Well, yes.

310
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:47,519
You should know better,
so why did you book last minute?

311
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,703
You were lucky we had rooms left--

312
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,389
Oh, oh... hmph.

313
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:56,671
Aren't you busy, sir? You may go work.

314
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,575
Yes, let me know if you need anything.

315
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:02,335
Oh, he's saying all kinds of things.

316
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,414
Anyway...

317
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:08,188
we've been cleaning and doing laundry.

318
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:12,432
It's been hard hosting guests,
so forget about our guest house.

319
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:14,745
Let's have fun while we're here, okay?

320
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:16,198
What should we do? What should we do?

321
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,999
Look, I still feel sick.
I'm going to go in and rest.

322
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:22,427
I really feel like I'm going to die.

323
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:23,998
Okay, then.

324
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:26,984
Let's go, then. I'll take you in.

325
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:32,191
Joon Ki... Joon Ki?

326
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:36,345
Where did Joon Ki go?

327
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,793
<i>Doo Shik, are you feeling better?</i>

328
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,178
<i>I need to lie down.</i>

329
00:16:40,178 --> 00:16:43,173
What? Oh no!

330
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,020
Oh my. Oh...

331
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,486
Get into bed.

332
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:55,052
- Thanks.
- Get some sleep.

333
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:56,693
I'll wake you up when it's time to eat.

334
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,863
No, I just need to be in bed
and I'll be out cold.

335
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,397
Don't worry about me and go have fun.

336
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,062
Okay.

337
00:17:03,062 --> 00:17:06,260
- Call if you need anything.
- Okay.

338
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:15,748
He sure is sleeping a long time.

339
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,983
Seo Jin. Seo Jin?

340
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,577
Where did she go off to?

341
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:35,898
<i>Sol, let's get you fed.</i>

342
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,348
What? What?

343
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,083
<i>Mommy will get your food.</i>

344
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:45,076
Were you hungry? I'll get your food.

345
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:47,200
Wait a little bit.

346
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:50,291
Oh!

347
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,646
Oh, where did it go?

348
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,327
What? Did something go missing?

349
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:57,577
Yes, my camera's gone.

350
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,446
I'm sure I left it here.

351
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,267
Are you sure you
didn't leave it elsewhere?

352
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:04,307
No, I know I left it here.

353
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:06,272
Where did it go?

354
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,026
Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you.

355
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:15,273
Did you see the camera here,
by any chance?

356
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:22,480
Then did anyone come in here
while we were gone?

357
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,976
Go away.

358
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,151
Why is this person acting so suspicious?

359
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:32,127
Excuse me. Shouldn't you answer
when asked a question?

360
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:35,057
Seriously, this person...

361
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,517
- Oh!
- Oh my.

362
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,529
What? Joon Ki?

363
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,619
Dong Gu! Hey, why am I here...

364
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,619
Oh, Su Ah.

365
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,148
Oh, Yoon Ah is here too.

366
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:48,064
Why are all of you here?

367
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:51,506
Why else? We're here for the workshop.
Why are you here?

368
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,765
- I thought you had a shoot.
- Huh?

369
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,537
Oh, that.

370
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:58,755
Our shoot is outside
and it's around this area.

371
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:02,915
I had to wait on standby for so long,
so I got a room and was sleeping.

372
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:05,972
- Why are you in the women's room?
- What?

373
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:07,935
This is the women's room?

374
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:10,976
I just went into the room
the owner took me to.

375
00:19:10,976 --> 00:19:14,457
That owner is quite unorganized.

376
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,227
I should say something to him.

377
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:19,186
He must've gotten confused
because he's working alone.

378
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:22,207
- There's your camera!
- Where?

379
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:23,992
- Oh!
- Gosh.

380
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:27,144
Oh, I found it.

381
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:30,108
You caused a fuss
and you didn't even look properly.

382
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:32,144
Thanks.

383
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:36,127
Joon Ki, what a strange coincidence.

384
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:42,826
I never dreamed
that I would meet you here.

385
00:19:42,826 --> 00:19:44,467
What a coincidence.

386
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:45,541
I know.

387
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,871
Yeah, what a scary coincidence.

388
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:52,395
If only Seo Jin didn't have work,
we would all be here.

389
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,244
What a waste.

390
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:56,723
Oh, I know.

391
00:19:57,257 --> 00:20:00,532
There's nothing we can do.
Isn't the view nice here?

392
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,173
Ah, it's great.

393
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:05,604
Really, how could there be
a guest house in a place like this?

394
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,273
What's with this rope?

395
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,977
I didn't see this before.

396
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:13,240
Hm... is this for a bell?

397
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,048
Oh no!

398
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,680
Mister! Are you okay?

399
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,723
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

400
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:25,269
I was cleaning. Why would you pull that?

401
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,573
Troublemaker.

402
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:30,244
I'm so sorry.
Should I take you to the hospital?

403
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:31,739
It's fine.

404
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,084
I have a group booking coming in soon.
What am I going to do?

405
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:38,483
I have to clean and shop.
There's so much to do.

406
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:39,943
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:42,349
Let me ask you for a favor.

408
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:44,030
A favor?

409
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,759
Nice going. Nice going.

410
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,626
You said forget the guest house
and have fun.

411
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:57,826
What is this?

412
00:20:57,826 --> 00:21:01,307
What can I do when
he got hurt because of me?

413
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:02,846
Forget us.

414
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,916
You dragged along a person
who had an MT trip to go on.

415
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,998
Good for you.

416
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:10,406
I'm sorry, Yoon Ah.

417
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:11,787
It's fine.

418
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:16,226
Folding towels where the air is nice
makes them seem easier to fold.

419
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:21,012
We only have to do this
until he comes back from the hospital

420
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:22,298
so wait just a bit.

421
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:23,385
Okay.

422
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:29,380
Oh, it's the owner.

423
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,679
Yes, Mister.

424
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,034
What? Ah, yes.

425
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:38,386
I understand.

426
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,482
What? What did he say?

427
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:43,714
He says he might be late.

428
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:47,153
He asked me to care for the guests.

429
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:48,502
And to go grocery shopping.

430
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:51,835
My goodness. Oh, I'm so annoyed.

431
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:54,603
Sorry, I'll go grocery shopping.

432
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:56,989
You guys can just clean here.

433
00:21:56,989 --> 00:22:00,631
Can you go alone, Dong Gu?
There's a lot you need to buy.

434
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:03,809
You two should go together.
We'll watch Sol.

435
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,258
- Okay, Joon Ki?
- Huh?

436
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,856
Yeah, I got it.

437
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:11,460
Watch over her for me, then.
Mommy will be back.

438
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:15,884
- Let's go, Dong Gu.
- Yes, let's go.

439
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:17,303
- Bye.
- Bye.

440
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,579
Sorry.

441
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:26,838
Joon Ki, why have you been acting
like a puppy who needs to poop?

442
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,924
- Is something wrong?
- What?

443
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:31,459
No, nothing's wrong.

444
00:22:36,076 --> 00:22:38,942
<i>Joon Ki, save me.
I'm trapped in the men's dorm room.</i>

445
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,432
Why is she in there?

446
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,394
I'm done mopping here, so I'll
change the sheets in the men's room.

447
00:22:48,394 --> 00:22:49,961
Okay, sure.

448
00:22:58,082 --> 00:23:01,059
- Joon Ki.
- Oh.

449
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,349
- Doo Shik!
- What are you doing here?

450
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,769
I thought you were shooting today.

451
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:08,060
The filming location is in this area.

452
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,390
This is where we are sleeping.

453
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,039
Really? What a funny coincidence.

454
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,777
I know. I was so taken aback
that I could cry.

455
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,711
Doo Shik, you came all this way.
Why are you lying in bed?

456
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,002
Let's go outside, Doo Shik.

457
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:32,395
No, thanks. I have motion sickness,
so I'm dizzy and feel nauseated.

458
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:36,092
That's when you need to get some air.
Let's go for a walk.

459
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:37,227
I'm too tired for it.

460
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:40,165
- Then get some sleep.
- I'm not sleepy.

461
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:42,744
- Then close your eyes.
- No, I have to play games.

462
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:45,125
Just get out!
Why are you only in the room?

463
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:48,421
- It's up to me. Why are you angry?
- Huh?

464
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:53,125
Well, that's because
I'm worried about you.

465
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,224
I'm worried.

466
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,355
Since when do you
worry so much about me?

467
00:23:56,355 --> 00:23:59,037
Whatever. I need to play games,
so don't talk to me.

468
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,195
Why, you punk...

469
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:04,343
<i>Joon Ki, what are you doing?
Guests are here. Get out here.</i>

470
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,265
All right!

471
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:12,782
Anyway, don't move at all
and wait here for a bit.

472
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:16,127
I'll help you get out of here somehow.
You trust me, right?

473
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:17,833
Wait just a little bit.

474
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,309
I'll be right back, okay?

475
00:24:25,726 --> 00:24:27,323
What was that?

476
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:29,963
Why would he want a dizzy person
to go outside?

477
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,343
What do we need to buy?

478
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:38,133
The group guests are having
pork belly later tonight.

479
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:40,553
- Should we buy vegetables first?
- Sure.

480
00:24:40,553 --> 00:24:42,472
There's the vegetable store.

481
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:43,598
Hello.

482
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,429
Welcome. What do you need?

483
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,818
Lettuce and perilla leaves
for about 10 people to eat.

484
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:52,471
Okay. You must be a newlywed couple.

485
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:54,308
You two look great together.

486
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:55,615
- Excuse me?
- What?

487
00:24:55,615 --> 00:24:59,083
It's nice to see your husband
come grocery shopping with you.

488
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,741
I remember a time
when my husband did that too.

489
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:06,357
You two are so pretty together,
so I'll give you a little more for free.

490
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:07,946
It's not that--

491
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:11,202
Thank you so much.
We'll enjoy it.

492
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:13,134
My husband loves lettuce wraps.

493
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:15,351
- Honey, it's so great, right?
- Huh?

494
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:20,332
Oh my. Your wife is so cute.
You must love it.

495
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:24,242
- Live well and happily.
- Yes, thank you.

496
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:27,326
- Let's go, Honey.
- What?

497
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:34,989
What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Honey"?

498
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:38,173
She's giving it to us for free.
Why bother correcting her?

499
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:40,287
We can eat the extra ones
she gave us, right?

500
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:43,095
Hey, that isn't right though.

501
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:46,078
Lying is bad, Yoon Ah.

502
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:52,075
Honey, it's your favorite food,
pork belly.

503
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:55,763
I don't make enough money,
so I can only buy two geun.

504
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:59,836
My baby can finish
that amount so quickly.

505
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:02,644
What do I do? It's not enough.

506
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,488
Honey.

507
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:12,508
It's your most favorite apple
in the world.

508
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:16,087
I don't have enough money
and this is all I can buy.

509
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:18,803
What should I do?

510
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,818
Oh... I'm so upset.

511
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:31,041
What was that?
You said I shouldn't lie.

512
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,700
Still, we got free meat and fruits.

513
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,258
It was nice.

514
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:42,807
What else do we need to buy?

515
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:46,325
Yoon Ah, hold on. Follow me.

516
00:26:46,325 --> 00:26:49,250
- Why? Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

517
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,406
Why are we here?

518
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:54,931
Oh, this one's pretty.

519
00:26:58,871 --> 00:27:00,622
Come here.

520
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:17,570
Dong Gu.

521
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:20,492
It's just...

522
00:27:20,492 --> 00:27:24,430
your bangs kept falling into your eyes.

523
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,048
It will only cause problems for me
if you trip and fall.

524
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:31,073
That's why I'm buying it for you,
so don't feel burdened.

525
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:33,846
There's no meaning behind it, really.

526
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:38,032
Thank you.

527
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:42,422
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

528
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:46,430
Let's go now.

529
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:55,952
Yoon Ah... let's go.

530
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:57,223
Yes.

531
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:05,417
- Yoon Ah, you like blood sausages?
- Yes.

532
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,273
- Should we go eat some?
- Yes, we should.

533
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:12,338
Ma'am, blood sausage for two here.

534
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:13,689
Yes.

535
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:24,474
What is it?
Would you like rice wine too?

536
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:26,654
What? It's not that.

537
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:29,796
They just seem to be enjoying
the rice wine so much.

538
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:32,079
You should have some too.

539
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,568
- Ma'am!
- Yes?

540
00:28:33,568 --> 00:28:35,880
- One bottle of rice wine too.
- Sure.

541
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,839
- It's okay.
- No, it's fine.

542
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:49,656
It's so good.

543
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:51,993
Gosh, is it that good?

544
00:28:51,993 --> 00:28:53,219
- Yes.
- Would you like one more?

545
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:55,769
I might get drunk if I have more.

546
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,968
So what if you get a little drunk
when you're here to have fun?

547
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:01,847
- Have one more drink.
- Should I?

548
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,862
<i>At that moment, I shouldn't have
given her that rice wine.</i>

549
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:20,821
Oh, my eyes hurt.

550
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:25,146
Why have we come all this way
to light up a grill?

551
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:26,877
It's so absurd.

552
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:29,775
Who told you guys to come here
for the workshop?

553
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:30,901
Why? Why!

554
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:34,002
Why are you asking me?
Dong Gu chose it.

555
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:38,181
- It's not ready yet?
- It will be soon.

556
00:29:38,181 --> 00:29:39,928
It's ready now.

557
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:41,310
You can cook it here.

558
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,387
Okay. Thank you.

559
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:49,987
Oh, that looks good.

560
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:52,446
Would you like some?
I bought a lot of meat.

561
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:53,986
Really?

562
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:57,587
Oh yeah. Doo Shik hasn't eaten all day.
He must be hungry.

563
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,933
I'll ask him if he'll eat.

564
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,347
Wait, wait.

565
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,781
I'll go ask him. You stay here.

566
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,076
Thank you.

567
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:06,702
No problem.

568
00:30:06,702 --> 00:30:08,762
Sol, it's meat.

569
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,369
Doo Shik, they said we can eat meat.
Come on out with me.

570
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:23,101
No, I feel nauseated. I don't want any.

571
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,407
The smell of it is killing me.
Why would I want it?

572
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,184
You never know.
Eating it might make you feel better.

573
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:31,071
No, I told you I feel nauseated.

574
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:34,230
Hey! Then why are you looking
at your phone all day long?

575
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,356
Go to sleep, then!

576
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:39,353
I told you I can't sleep.
Why do you keep getting angry?

577
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:42,530
You awful jerk.

578
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:47,576
- Hold on a little longer.
- Huh?

579
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:50,066
You need to be strong
and hold on, all right?

580
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:55,087
I'll find an opportunity to
get you out of this room, okay?

581
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,003
I said I'm not leaving.
I don't want to.

582
00:31:02,003 --> 00:31:05,489
What's wrong with him?
Why would I be strong and hold on?

583
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:09,059
Oh, that's good.

584
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:14,128
Why are you alone?
Doo Shik doesn't want to eat?

585
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:16,099
No, he doesn't want to eat.

586
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:19,588
Really? He must be feeling very sick.

587
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,375
You should eat, at least.

588
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,801
No, I don't have an appetite.

589
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:31,759
<i>Joon Ki, I want some pork belly.
I'm dying of hunger.</i>

590
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,673
Gosh, can she think of pork belly
in this situation?

591
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:39,252
So absurd, so absurd.

592
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,721
What are you doing?
Why are you taking that?

593
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:51,028
- You said Doo Shik's not eating.
- Huh?

594
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,217
Oh, the thing is...

595
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:58,306
there's this starving cat over there.

596
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:00,895
I feel sorry for it.

597
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:02,130
Can I feed this to the cat?

598
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,522
Yes, go ahead.

599
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,690
Thank you.

600
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:13,209
<i>Butterfly, butterfly.</i>

601
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:17,128
<i>I am calling out for you.</i>

602
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:24,538
Why are you here again?

603
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:26,048
I said I don't want pork belly.

604
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:28,240
I'm not here to see you,
so mind your own business.

605
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,502
Why are you here to see?

606
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:32,069
You don't need to know.
Just play your game.

607
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:33,840
Why do you keep getting angry?

608
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:37,295
Hm... what's with that paper cup?

609
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:38,638
Huh?

610
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,711
Coffee...coffee.

611
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,852
Since I've seen you here,
I'm going now.

612
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:57,123
Wait.

613
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,556
Where did that coffee
you were holding go?

614
00:33:01,556 --> 00:33:02,788
Huh?

615
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:05,682
Oh, that.

616
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:11,586
Ta-da! It's magic.

617
00:33:11,586 --> 00:33:13,392
It's totally gone, isn't it?

618
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:14,996
Where could it be?

619
00:33:14,996 --> 00:33:17,984
Wow, that's awesome.
Amazing! How did you do it?

620
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:20,923
Joon Ki, show me again.
Show me one more time.

621
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:23,236
Why would I show you? Get lost!

622
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,368
He definitely had it.

623
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:29,200
<i>What about the lettuce?</i>

624
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,432
Gosh.

625
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,949
Joon Ki, don't be like that
and show me one more time.

626
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:35,929
I'm just so amazed by it.

627
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:37,419
Really?

628
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,480
Is that what you really want?

629
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,689
I do, I do. I want to see again.

630
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,085
Show me, show me.

631
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:44,913
Wait a little bit.

632
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:51,071
Joon Ki, you said you'd show me magic.
Where are you going?

633
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:56,526
Oh... ha!

634
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:02,306
Ta-da!

635
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:05,781
Awesome!
That's really amazing. It really is.

636
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:08,193
Where did it go?
Show me again. Do it again.

637
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:10,864
Why would I do it again? Get lost.

638
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:12,617
How did you do it?

639
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:17,056
<i>What about garlic
and soybean paste sauce?</i>

640
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,583
Joon Ki, don't be like that.

641
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,384
Show me just one more time, just once.

642
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:25,114
Are you really going to be this way?
Are you really?

643
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:28,764
Must you really have everything?

644
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:31,068
Will that make you feel better?

645
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:34,795
What are you talking about?
I'm just really curious.

646
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:37,007
Show me one last time, okay?

647
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:41,000
Okay... you're saying that I must.

648
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:52,181
Oh... yeah!

649
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:54,543
Ta-da.

650
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:56,653
It's amazing every time I see it.

651
00:34:56,653 --> 00:34:59,242
Wow, where did it go?

652
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:02,353
That was the last time.
It really is the last time.

653
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:06,286
I can't do it anymore.
Don't expect more from me.

654
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:09,213
Okay, but it is really amazing.

655
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:10,844
Joon Ki, when did you learn magic?

656
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,628
I don't know, man! Get lost!

657
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:15,320
Get lost!

658
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,753
Why's he getting angry?

659
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:41,577
Yoon Ah, I think you're drunk now.
You should stop drinking.

660
00:35:41,577 --> 00:35:43,936
I'm not drunk at all.

661
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:45,336
I'm perfectly fine.

662
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:47,438
Okay, but stop drinking.

663
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:50,369
We need to buy a few more things.

664
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:51,826
Okay.

665
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:57,139
By the way, Dong Gu,
do you like hide and seek?

666
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:58,998
Hide and seek?

667
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:02,059
I really like hide and seek.

668
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,239
Do you want to play hide and seek?

669
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,800
Why would we suddenly play
hide and seek?

670
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,692
We need to finish shopping.
Come on, let's go.

671
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:19,338
- How much is it?
- 14,000 won.

672
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:25,144
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

673
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:26,905
- Thank you for the food.
- You're welcome.

674
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,851
Yoon Ah, let's get going...

675
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:31,280
What?

676
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,222
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah!

677
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:36,722
Where did this woman go?

678
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,726
This is crazy.

679
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:41,340
Yoon Ah... Yoon Ah!

680
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,809
Yoon Ah!

681
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,670
Gosh, where did she go?

682
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,505
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah!

683
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:50,516
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah.

684
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,039
Newlywed.

685
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:54,356
Over there.

686
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,905
Yoon Ah, what are you doing here?

687
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,139
I got caught.

688
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,141
Ah, Dong Gu found me.

689
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:09,606
Then, I guess I'm "it" now.

690
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:12,661
Dong Gu, go on and hide now.

691
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:15,041
Why would I go hide?

692
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,748
Pull yourself together, Yoon Ah.

693
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:19,916
She was fine earlier today.
What's wrong with her now?

694
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:23,541
We had some rice wine.
I guess she's drunk.

695
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,476
Oh, yeah. Can I get some green onions?

696
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,090
Okay.

697
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:33,844
What?

698
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:37,679
Yoon Ah, where did you go now?

699
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,157
She's driving me crazy.

700
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,871
Gosh.

701
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,492
What are you doing here, Yoon Ah?

702
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:53,050
Oh, I got caught again!

703
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,440
Okay, I'll be "it" now.

704
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,293
Hurry up and hide, Dong Gu.

705
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:58,967
I'm really going to go crazy.

706
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:01,594
Are you possessed by a ghost
who loves hide and seek?

707
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:04,809
You don't want to?
Okay, all right.

708
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:07,318
I'll hide again!

709
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,349
Hey, where do you think you're going?

710
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:12,288
Dong Gu, let me go.

711
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:14,356
I have to go hide!

712
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:16,907
What am I supposed to do with this woman?

713
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:27,045
Oh, Dong Gu. Untie this for me.

714
00:38:27,045 --> 00:38:29,510
I really have to hide.

715
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,101
Be quiet!

716
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:34,092
I've never seen such a strange
drinking habit in all my life.

717
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,994
Just follow me!

718
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:41,693
I'm really going insane.

719
00:39:03,086 --> 00:39:06,190
Yoon Ah, Yoon Ah...
get it together!

720
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,291
Geez, I got caught again.

721
00:39:10,704 --> 00:39:13,074
Okay, it's your turn
to hide now, Dong Gu.

722
00:39:13,074 --> 00:39:15,141
I'm "it."

723
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:17,639
Seriously, I'm going to go crazy.

724
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,157
Oh! All right, then.

725
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:25,503
I'll be "it" this time too.
You can hide this time, okay?

726
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:27,949
I know a place
where you'll never be found.

727
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,251
Do you want to know it?

728
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:30,414
Where is it?

729
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:34,146
Over here. Come follow me. It's here.

730
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:45,373
If I hide in here,
Dong Gu can't find me?

731
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:47,422
No, I can't.

732
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,610
Okay.

733
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:57,577
Hide, hide.

734
00:39:57,577 --> 00:40:01,820
Dong Gu, I'm hiding now.
Come find me.

735
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,728
Yes. Oh my!

736
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:09,507
You're so well hidden that I can't
even see a hair on your head.

737
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,860
What am I to do?

738
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,398
What am I doing on my trip?

739
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:46,074
What is this? I've been found again.

740
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:49,384
Dong Gu, you can really
hide this time. I'll be "it."

741
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:51,335
That's enough, Yoon Ah.

742
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:54,327
Please pull yourself together.

743
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:58,244
Dong Gu, are you angry at me?

744
00:40:58,244 --> 00:41:00,391
- I'm not angry.
- No.

745
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,344
- I think you're angry.
- I'm not angry.

746
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:07,704
I'm sorry. I'm really,
really sorry, Dong Gu.

747
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:09,744
There's no need to be sorry.

748
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:11,813
Please just sleep until we get there.

749
00:41:11,813 --> 00:41:13,496
Please, please.

750
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:19,865
- Dong Gu...
- What now?

751
00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:23,335
You're having a hard time
because of me, right?

752
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:25,746
I know that very well.

753
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,105
But...

754
00:41:29,994 --> 00:41:31,835
I'm scared.

755
00:41:34,664 --> 00:41:37,358
I could get hurt again.

756
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:41,248
So, I'm scared.

757
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:44,992
I'm so scared of that.

758
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:51,867
So, you can't hate me, Dong Gu.

759
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:55,335
Don't hate me.

760
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:24,577
Doo Shik, are you feeling better?

761
00:42:24,577 --> 00:42:27,134
Yes, I feel better since I got some rest.

762
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:29,266
Really? What a relief.

763
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:30,987
Should we get some air, then?

764
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:34,039
Yeah, after this. I'm on the last round.

765
00:42:37,356 --> 00:42:40,016
What is this sound?

766
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:43,440
Is this the sound of snoring?

767
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,014
That person has been
sleeping since we arrived.

768
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:47,972
How many hours is that?

769
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,574
Oh, what's that?

770
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:53,835
What kind of a guy has hair that long?

771
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:55,289
You're right.

772
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:58,105
- Wait.
- Huh?

773
00:42:58,105 --> 00:43:00,059
Is he wearing flower-patterned clothes?

774
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:01,277
Flowers?

775
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:02,918
You're right.

776
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,400
It looks like a one-piece dress.

777
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,168
Is that really a man?

778
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,750
What... what are you talking about?
He looks obviously like a man.

779
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,869
Many guys have long hair.

780
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:15,780
Also, don't you guys know about unisex?

781
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,802
There's no difference
between men's and women's clothes.

782
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:19,168
Even I have flowers on my...

783
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:22,286
Hey, what are you doing?

784
00:43:22,286 --> 00:43:24,280
Still, it's odd.

785
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,393
And what kind of a man has
a better body than I do?

786
00:43:26,393 --> 00:43:27,833
- Huh?
- Yeah.

787
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,452
Maybe it's a woman.

788
00:43:29,452 --> 00:43:31,650
- What?
- Su Ah, check.

789
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,423
- Should I?
- Hey!

790
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:35,851
Why would you bother checking?
Don't bother people like that.

791
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:37,579
It's rude. Don't do it.

792
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:40,789
Move. I'll only take a quick look.

793
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:43,672
I said move.

794
00:43:49,688 --> 00:43:51,248
What the heck?

795
00:43:52,385 --> 00:43:54,666
It's a man. He has a mustache.

796
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,416
- A mustache.
- Really?

797
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:57,717
I thought it might be a woman.

798
00:43:57,717 --> 00:43:59,181
The mustache.

799
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:01,034
- Wait.
- Huh?

800
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:03,068
Seo Jin is a woman
who has a mustache too.

801
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:04,467
- Seo Jin.
- Hey.

802
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:07,786
You think there's another woman in
the world who has facial hair like her?

803
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:08,840
I suppose not.

804
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,637
Anyway, once Dong Gu gets back

805
00:44:10,637 --> 00:44:12,856
let's go out to shoot pictures
since you feel better.

806
00:44:12,856 --> 00:44:13,864
Okay.

807
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,670
Yoon Ah.

808
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,545
Yoon Ah, we're here.

809
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,771
Oh my.

810
00:46:04,188 --> 00:46:06,820
Dong Gu.

811
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,391
What happened?

812
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,730
What do you think happened?

813
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,661
You got drunk, insisted on playing
hide and seek, and kept hiding.

814
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:17,710
Do you know how much I ran around
the market looking for you?

815
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,889
Oh, I did that?

816
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:21,880
I'm sorry.

817
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,021
I have a habit of playing hide and seek
when I get drunk.

818
00:46:26,021 --> 00:46:29,175
Did I do anything else
I shouldn't have besides that?

819
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:31,527
There was nothing.

820
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:34,068
Oh, I'm relieved.

821
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:36,759
I'm sorry, Dong Gu.

822
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:39,510
It's okay. You should rest.

823
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,376
It's okay. There's a lot to do.
I should get out there.

824
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:58,358
Where did everyone go?
The group should be arriving soon.

825
00:46:58,358 --> 00:46:59,827
Is anyone here?

826
00:46:59,827 --> 00:47:01,813
I think the guests are here.

827
00:47:01,813 --> 00:47:03,480
Welcome.

828
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,976
Oh, Hyun Joon.

829
00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:10,456
Yoon Ah, how did this happen?

830
00:47:10,456 --> 00:47:12,856
You were coming here for your workshop?

831
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:15,556
Yes, how did you end up here, Hyun Joon?

832
00:47:15,556 --> 00:47:18,947
This is the guest house
that my friend owns.

833
00:47:18,947 --> 00:47:21,135
Wow. This is amazing.

834
00:47:21,135 --> 00:47:24,371
I see. What a coincidence.

835
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,045
Let's move the clothing bags
to the lobby.

836
00:47:32,045 --> 00:47:33,614
Okay.

837
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:38,324
Oh, why is it so noisy outside?

838
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:41,340
Are the guests here? Let's go, Doo Shik.

839
00:47:46,554 --> 00:47:50,132
Seo Jin, Seo Jin. Wake up, Seo Jin.

840
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:52,157
Hm, what is it?

841
00:47:52,157 --> 00:47:55,818
Wake up. How can you sleep
in this situation?

842
00:47:57,413 --> 00:47:59,077
What happened here?

843
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:02,130
I don't know, but you don't have time.
Get out of here before they return.

844
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,380
Okay.

845
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:08,541
Oh, it hurts.

846
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:11,963
Gosh, why is he there?

847
00:48:11,963 --> 00:48:13,731
I'm going insane.

848
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:17,253
Seo Jin, you can't leave through here.
What should we do?

849
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:19,717
Really? Then, what should I do?

850
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:23,146
Oh, the window.

851
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,056
Open it, open it.

852
00:48:26,056 --> 00:48:28,617
What's wrong with this?

853
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:31,168
Gosh, I think this is broken.

854
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,021
Geez, that's a problem.

855
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:36,822
Dong Gu will throw a fit
if we get caught.

856
00:48:36,822 --> 00:48:38,835
What do we do?

857
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,360
- Oh, I got it.
- What?

858
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,521
Do you have an idea?

859
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:49,161
- Seo Jin.
- Yeah?

860
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:50,659
Go in there.

861
00:48:51,347 --> 00:48:52,827
What?

862
00:48:52,827 --> 00:48:55,324
You want me to go inside the bag?
Are you crazy?

863
00:48:55,324 --> 00:48:58,802
What can we do? Doo Shik's out there
and the window's broken.

864
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,496
You want to go back into the blankets?

865
00:49:00,496 --> 00:49:02,449
What if you get caught? What will you do?

866
00:49:02,449 --> 00:49:04,018
Do I really have to do this?

867
00:49:04,018 --> 00:49:06,452
We have no other way.

868
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:08,768
Okay, okay.

869
00:49:08,768 --> 00:49:12,126
Okay, get inside. Go on, go on.

870
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:26,210
Here. Come on.

871
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:28,507
Be careful going in.

872
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,302
I'll get you out soon.

873
00:49:50,804 --> 00:49:52,403
Wait a little bit.

874
00:50:08,465 --> 00:50:13,208
Oh! Seo Jin, Seo Jin!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

875
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:18,485
- Joon Ki.
- You scared me!

876
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:21,985
You startled me.
Why are you so shocked?

877
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:24,184
Where are you going with my luggage?

878
00:50:24,184 --> 00:50:27,364
Huh? Well, I.... uh...

879
00:50:27,364 --> 00:50:30,434
Oh, you were carrying it for us because
we're going to our photo shoot?

880
00:50:30,434 --> 00:50:32,188
Thank you.

881
00:50:32,188 --> 00:50:34,375
- Why is this so heavy?
- Uh, wait...

882
00:50:38,795 --> 00:50:41,378
Why is it so heavy?
How many clothes are in here?

883
00:50:41,378 --> 00:50:42,615
Be quiet.

884
00:50:49,224 --> 00:50:51,534
Why have you been following us, Joon Ki?

885
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:54,085
- Yeah.
- Huh?

886
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:57,134
Just to help you guys.

887
00:50:57,134 --> 00:51:00,342
Su Ah, the luggage is heavy, right?
I'll carry it.

888
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:02,534
I'd be thankful for that.

889
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,822
Let's go.

890
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:14,018
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

891
00:51:15,077 --> 00:51:17,146
This worked out really well.

892
00:51:17,146 --> 00:51:19,586
I was really disappointed that you
couldn't join us, Yoon Ah.

893
00:51:19,586 --> 00:51:22,018
- How is it that we met you here?
- I know.

894
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:26,436
I never imagined that this place
was owned by Hyun Joon's friend.

895
00:51:26,436 --> 00:51:28,469
What should we do now?

896
00:51:28,469 --> 00:51:31,293
It's a little early to eat.

897
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:32,762
Should we play a game?

898
00:51:32,762 --> 00:51:35,007
A game sounds good.
What should we do?

899
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:36,498
I say 007.

900
00:51:36,498 --> 00:51:37,967
Electricity game.

901
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:44,663
Oh no. I think foot volleyball
is necessary for an MT trip.

902
00:51:44,663 --> 00:51:45,733
Foot volleyball?

903
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:49,322
There are women here.
I don't know about foot volleyball.

904
00:51:49,322 --> 00:51:52,503
There's no "woman" or "man" in sports.

905
00:51:52,503 --> 00:51:54,344
People would judge you for saying that.

906
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,431
It's not that.

907
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:58,786
Everyone is tired, so I don't know
about a sport with a ball.

908
00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:02,567
How about an indoor game of charades?

909
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:05,576
I'm telling you foot volleyball
is key for an MT.

910
00:52:05,576 --> 00:52:06,846
Don't you agree, Yoon Ah?

911
00:52:06,846 --> 00:52:08,434
I'm still a little dizzy

912
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:10,905
so I don't think
I can do foot volleyball.

913
00:52:10,905 --> 00:52:13,315
I think charades would be better.

914
00:52:13,315 --> 00:52:16,547
Dong Gu, play with us, okay?

915
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:19,811
Yes, well. Sure.

916
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,210
I'm really bad at this stuff.

917
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,260
We lived together under one roof
for so long.

918
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,688
Hyun Joon may not know.

919
00:52:32,688 --> 00:52:36,501
I can get the answer to all of yours,
100 percent.

920
00:52:37,181 --> 00:52:38,768
<i>[Egg]</i>

921
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,684
Answer. Fart, fart.

922
00:52:46,992 --> 00:52:49,376
Oh, I have the answer.

923
00:52:49,376 --> 00:52:52,722
Constipation, constipation.
You can't poop.

924
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,614
- Egg?
- That's the answer!

925
00:52:56,496 --> 00:52:58,300
<i>[Shrimp]</i>

926
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,599
Answer! Zombie... zombie.

927
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,329
A zombie with a broken back.

928
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:05,599
Shrimp.

929
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,661
Correct. Wow.

930
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,597
What is that? What the heck is that?

931
00:53:11,597 --> 00:53:14,106
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being."

932
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,780
"Even if the planet falls tomorrow,
I will plant one apple tree today."

933
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,791
Yes, that's it. Wow.

934
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:23,030
Wow. You're really good at it, Hyun Joon.

935
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,231
How could you get that?
Does that make sense?

936
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:27,094
Does that even make sense?

937
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:30,978
I'm starting. Looks good.

938
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:32,400
Once more...

939
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:36,222
Good.

940
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:39,577
- Seo Jin. Seo Jin.
- <i>Joon Ki.</i>

941
00:53:41,896 --> 00:53:43,090
Are you okay?

942
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,735
How long do I have to stay in here?

943
00:53:45,735 --> 00:53:48,994
My legs hurt and it's so cramped in here.

944
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:51,244
Sorry, sorry. Hold on a bit.

945
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:53,284
I'll do whatever is necessary, okay?

946
00:53:53,284 --> 00:53:55,813
Joon Ki, who are you talking to?

947
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,364
Oh... this rock.

948
00:54:00,364 --> 00:54:04,577
Gosh, you must be so frustrated
being stepped on.

949
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:07,552
You are a strong friend.

950
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,807
What are you talking about?
Move. I need my clothes.

951
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:12,967
- I need to do my next outfit.
- No!

952
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:15,641
What? What do you mean, no?

953
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:17,693
No, no. You can't open this.

954
00:54:17,693 --> 00:54:21,063
- Why are you doing that with my luggage?
- I said no!

955
00:54:21,063 --> 00:54:23,273
I can't ever give you this luggage bag.
I said no!

956
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:26,208
Are you crazy? What's with you?
Give me my bag.

957
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,617
No, no, no!

958
00:54:27,617 --> 00:54:29,639
- Oh my.
- Oh, oh!

959
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:31,516
Huh? Hm?

960
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,052
Oh, oh! What's he doing?

961
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:37,760
- Doo Shik, go catch him.
- Okay.

962
00:54:40,436 --> 00:54:43,030
Joon Ki... hey, Joon Ki!

963
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,706
Why are you doing this?

964
00:54:46,094 --> 00:54:47,730
Gosh.

965
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,775
Where did he go?

966
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:09,206
Why would he run off with my luggage?

967
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:11,387
I don't know. Has he lost his mind?

968
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:14,476
Hey, I don't think he's here.
Let's go over there.

969
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:15,527
Okay.

970
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:24,773
They're gone, Seo Jin.

971
00:55:24,773 --> 00:55:27,072
It's over now. It's over now--

972
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,496
What happened?

973
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:34,313
What? What happened here?

974
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:36,612
It can't be.

975
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:42,521
Seo Jin... Seo Jin!

976
00:55:42,521 --> 00:55:45,179
Seo Jin! Stop!

977
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:57,050
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being."

978
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:59,000
Aren't you all hungry
from playing the game?

979
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,498
Shall we eat something now?

980
00:56:01,498 --> 00:56:03,168
Shall we?

981
00:56:03,168 --> 00:56:04,750
You should all relax here.

982
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,360
When you come on trips like this,
men should do the cooking.

983
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,097
- Oh...
- I'll cook.

984
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:12,099
Wait.

985
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:16,385
Then why don't you do it along with
Kang Dong Gu, a real man?

986
00:56:16,385 --> 00:56:18,516
- You know how to cook too?
- Of course.

987
00:56:18,516 --> 00:56:21,527
I've been the CEO of a guest house
for many years, after all.

988
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:24,297
Most chefs can't even give me
their business cards.

989
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,648
Is that right?

990
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,914
Then let's do it together.

991
00:56:27,914 --> 00:56:29,885
Sounds good. Let's go.

992
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:32,199
I will show you the taste of a real man.

993
00:56:40,507 --> 00:56:42,204
What are you going to make?

994
00:56:42,204 --> 00:56:45,775
I want to grill some meat
and make kimchi stew.

995
00:56:45,775 --> 00:56:49,768
Oh, kimchi stew.
I was going to make that too.

996
00:56:49,768 --> 00:56:52,514
It's my specialty.
How are you going to make it?

997
00:56:52,514 --> 00:56:54,697
I'll use some pork and kimchi.

998
00:56:54,697 --> 00:56:56,110
Then I just need to let it stew.

999
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,286
Hey, now.

1000
00:56:57,286 --> 00:57:01,541
Kimchi stew should be made with mackerel.

1001
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:04,262
Isn't it the safest bet
to go with pork meat?

1002
00:57:04,262 --> 00:57:07,157
You don't know what you're talking about.

1003
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:09,956
Should we bet on which one is better?

1004
00:57:09,956 --> 00:57:11,576
Sounds good.

1005
00:57:12,952 --> 00:57:14,617
Let us start.

1006
00:57:53,157 --> 00:57:55,952
You made two kimchi stews?

1007
00:57:55,952 --> 00:58:01,094
Yes, we had different opinions about
what kind of kimchi stew to make.

1008
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:02,811
You should all try both.

1009
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:05,150
Please judge which you like better.

1010
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,782
We made a bet.

1011
00:58:07,782 --> 00:58:09,764
Oh, really?

1012
00:58:09,764 --> 00:58:11,672
Then I'll try some.

1013
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,704
Oh, this is greasy.

1014
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:23,282
Yum, this one is perfect. It's good.

1015
00:58:23,284 --> 00:58:24,992
Yum. It really is.

1016
00:58:24,992 --> 00:58:27,572
I like the kimchi stew
with pork better too.

1017
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:29,202
How about you, Yoon Ah?

1018
00:58:34,148 --> 00:58:36,327
Yum, this is good.

1019
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:38,862
How about that one?

1020
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:45,784
Hm...

1021
00:58:46,853 --> 00:58:51,322
This one is good,
but it's slightly oily.

1022
00:58:52,204 --> 00:58:54,481
Honestly, I don't really like fish.

1023
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:55,601
Yes.

1024
00:58:55,601 --> 00:58:56,757
What is it?

1025
00:58:56,757 --> 00:58:59,586
Was the mackerel stew yours, Dong Gu?

1026
00:59:01,947 --> 00:59:04,206
Does it matter who won?

1027
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:07,018
As long as everyone eats like this.

1028
00:59:07,773 --> 00:59:09,702
I'm sorry.

1029
00:59:09,702 --> 00:59:11,849
No, it's fine.

1030
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:15,425
I think I'll go get some air.

1031
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:33,019
The weather is nice and the air is good.

1032
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:35,519
Song Hyun Joon is not good.

1033
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:38,987
Song Hyun Joon, Song Hyun Joon,
Song Hyun Joon, that jerk.

1034
00:59:38,987 --> 00:59:42,344
Nothing ever works out because of him.

1035
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:57,077
Looks like no one's eating this.
Should I put it away?

1036
00:59:57,077 --> 00:59:59,128
Just leave it. I'll eat it.

1037
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,289
- I thought you didn't like fish.
- Huh?

1038
01:00:03,257 --> 01:00:05,152
But this one looks good.

1039
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:06,681
I'll eat it.

1040
01:00:29,702 --> 01:00:33,813
I knew he was already crazy,
but I really don't understand it.

1041
01:00:33,813 --> 01:00:36,769
Why would he run off with my bag?

1042
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:38,320
Has he lost his mind?

1043
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,400
Leave him be.

1044
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,268
Don't try to understand Joon Ki's mind.
Give up on it.

1045
01:00:42,268 --> 01:00:45,534
We couldn't even finish our shoot
because of him. What is this?

1046
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,695
Oh, Joon Ki.

1047
01:00:50,925 --> 01:00:53,097
- Give me that bag.
- What?

1048
01:00:53,097 --> 01:00:55,088
Why do you keep doing this?

1049
01:00:55,088 --> 01:00:58,007
Hand it over while I'm being nice.
Give it to me now.

1050
01:00:58,007 --> 01:00:59,887
Do you have a grudge against this bag?

1051
01:00:59,887 --> 01:01:01,416
Why are you doing this?

1052
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:02,893
Stop talking and hand it over.

1053
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:04,556
No, no. Stop it!

1054
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:07,074
- Give it to me.
- Give me back my bag!

1055
01:01:07,074 --> 01:01:09,724
- Give it to me.
- Joon Ki, what are you doing?

1056
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:20,530
My clothes! What are you going to do?

1057
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:22,882
Seo... Seo Jin. Seo Jin!

1058
01:01:22,882 --> 01:01:24,692
What do you mean, Seo Jin?

1059
01:01:25,547 --> 01:01:26,809
Seo Jin!

1060
01:01:33,313 --> 01:01:34,668
Seo Jin, no.

1061
01:01:34,668 --> 01:01:36,427
Why is he being like that?

1062
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:39,204
No, no, no! Seo Jin!

1063
01:01:39,204 --> 01:01:41,047
Seo Jin, Seo Jin!

1064
01:01:41,047 --> 01:01:43,699
Wait, Seo Jin? What's he talking about?

1065
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:46,215
I don't know. I think he's crazy.
What do we do?

1066
01:01:46,215 --> 01:01:49,556
Seo Jin! No, you can't, Seo Jin.

1067
01:01:49,556 --> 01:01:50,947
No, Seo Jin!

1068
01:01:50,947 --> 01:01:52,615
Why do you keep calling for Seo Jin?

1069
01:01:52,615 --> 01:01:54,157
- Joon Ki!
- Get out of there.

1070
01:01:55,931 --> 01:01:58,561
- Come here.
- Get over here.

1071
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:00,989
Get it up. Get it up.

1072
01:02:05,563 --> 01:02:07,322
Seo Jin, Seo Jin.

1073
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:09,615
Seo Jin.

1074
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:11,702
What is that?

1075
01:02:12,204 --> 01:02:13,545
Are you okay?

1076
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,331
I'm okay... I'm okay.

1077
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:20,775
- I'm okay.
- It's really Seo Jin?

1078
01:02:20,775 --> 01:02:23,244
Why is Seo Jin in there?

1079
01:02:23,244 --> 01:02:24,675
What happened?

1080
01:02:27,465 --> 01:02:30,045
Joon Ki, don't tell me...

1081
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:31,530
this is magic!

1082
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:34,402
Joon Ki, that's awesome.
You can do these things too?

1083
01:02:34,402 --> 01:02:37,065
What magic? What nonsense
are you talking about?

1084
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:40,583
Joon Ki, what happened?
Why is Seo Jin here?

1085
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:43,748
- So, what happened is...
- What are all of you doing there?

1086
01:02:43,748 --> 01:02:45,644
What is it? What are you doing?

1087
01:02:45,644 --> 01:02:46,889
- Dong Gu.
- What is it?

1088
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,168
Oh, Seo Jin! What are you doing here?

1089
01:02:51,347 --> 01:02:53,849
You said you had to do
a story on a funeral.

1090
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:56,556
Dong Gu, what happened was--

1091
01:02:56,556 --> 01:02:57,802
Hold on, hold on.

1092
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:01,012
What is this wave of ominous feeling
that I'm getting?

1093
01:03:02,202 --> 01:03:07,952
What is this feeling like I'm going to
be exposed to a big truth?

1094
01:03:08,672 --> 01:03:12,708
Well, so... uh...

1095
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:16,219
Joon Ki, let's stop now, okay?

1096
01:03:16,219 --> 01:03:19,007
Let's just tell the truth.

1097
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:20,581
Tell the truth?

1098
01:03:21,237 --> 01:03:22,443
What does that mean?

1099
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:25,472
Oh, so...

1100
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,601
Well, um...

1101
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,094
Are you going to be like this
until the end?

1102
01:03:30,094 --> 01:03:32,110
Fine. Forget it, then.

1103
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,693
You jerk.

1104
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:45,050
Hm?

1105
01:03:48,512 --> 01:03:49,588
What is that?

1106
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:53,920
What are you two doing?

1107
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:56,775
Why are you two holding hands?

1108
01:03:56,775 --> 01:03:58,028
Dong Gu.

1109
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,601
I like Seo Jin.

1110
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:01,697
What?

1111
01:04:04,355 --> 01:04:05,389
What?

1112
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,320
What are you talking about?

1113
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:10,346
I, Lee Joon Ki...

1114
01:04:11,411 --> 01:04:13,538
like your younger sister, Kang Seo Jin.

1115
01:04:13,538 --> 01:04:14,563
No...

1116
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:17,101
I love her.

1117
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,552
Wh... what?

1118
01:04:20,344 --> 01:04:21,503
Love?

1119
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:26,373
So, to summarize all of this...

1120
01:04:26,373 --> 01:04:29,873
you and Seo Jin love each other?

1121
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:33,041
Do you mean it?

1122
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:35,963
Yes, I love Seo Jin.

1123
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:39,603
So, you can kill me or let me live.

1124
01:04:40,275 --> 01:04:41,869
It's up to you to decide.

1125
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:43,478
Kill you or let you live?

1126
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:46,085
Is that right?

1127
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:48,802
Then die!

1128
01:04:49,893 --> 01:04:52,172
How could you do that, Joon Ki?

1129
01:04:52,172 --> 01:04:55,103
It's not just any girl,
but my little sister!

1130
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:56,625
You punk!

1131
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,900
How long has it been going on? How long?

1132
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,974
Tell me now!

1133
