1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,480
- Okay. - I'll hit the slate. 1, 2.

2
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:14,381
("Welcome to Waikiki" shows us...)

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,720
(the story about how the three youths grow up.)

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,161
(There are 6 main characters in "Welcome to Waikiki".)

5
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:23,321
(Dong Gu, a director wannabe, who has become cynical)

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,460
I'm an actor.

7
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,931
(Light-hearted actor for survival, Jun Ki)

8
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:32,845
- Dong Gu. - Why?

9
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:35,845
(Du Shik, who dreams about pure love but has never dated anyone)

10
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:37,616
Come here. I'll feed you.

11
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:40,256
Hey.

12
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:43,996
(Clumsy single mom, Yoon Ah)

13
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:46,796
This is not the place to act up.

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,525
How dare you?

15
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:50,896
(Seo Jin, who is wild but cool)

16
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:53,595
Love? That won't last forever.

17
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,036
You sound like a snob.

18
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:57,976
(Soo Ah, a model who is always straightforward)

19
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,775
(The actors will tell us about the episodes...)

20
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:02,275
That wasn't it.

21
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,976
(And they will talk about the behind stories.)

22
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:07,915
(We'll also show you the bloopers and edited scenes.)

23
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:10,185
- No. Don't pull me too hard. - Seriously.

24
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:11,585
We should do it again.

25
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:15,456
(Welcome to Waikiki Special 2 starts now!)

26
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,555
Hello, everyone. Welcome to...

27
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:21,126
- Waikiki! - Waikiki!

28
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:22,465
(Welcome back to Waikiki.)

29
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,236
Make some noise!

30
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:25,335
(Make some noise!)

31
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:28,965
Shall we introduce ourselves?

32
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:31,775
I'm Kim Jung Hyun, and I play Gang Dong Gu,

33
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:34,445
the CEO of the guesthouse.

34
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:36,706
Hello. I'm Lee Yi Kyung and I play Jun Ki...

35
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:38,545
in "Welcome to Waikiki".

36
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,415
I'm Son Seung Won and I play Du Shik.

37
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:44,756
My name is Jung In Sun and I play Han Yoon Ah.

38
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:48,085
I'm Go Won Hee, and I play Kang Seo Jin.

39
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:51,055
I'm Lee Ju Woo. I play Soo Ah.

40
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:54,566
Like yesterday,

41
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:56,465
we've prepared a commentary special.

42
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:57,896
We'll review our favorite scenes...

43
00:01:57,896 --> 00:02:02,006
and the best episode our viewers have chosen.

44
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,775
You'll get to watch our bloopers as well.

45
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,105
Please look forward to it.

46
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,346
Look forward to it.

47
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:11,846
I want each of you...

48
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:13,376
to talk about...

49
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:17,816
your favorite scene.

50
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:20,156
My favorite is...

51
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:23,425
the scene where Jun Ki gets a wax.

52
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:31,536
(Jun Ki has to get a wax for his role.)

53
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,506
This is where you get waxed.

54
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,115
Do I really have to do this?

55
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:45,445
This is driving me crazy.

56
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:47,846
What is this?

57
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:49,415
Who put such a worn-out doll here?

58
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:52,355
- Oh, my gosh! - Hello.

59
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:54,156
Hi. Who are you?

60
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,056
I'll be waxing you today.

61
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,855
Are you? Really?

62
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,925
Don't be embarrassed.

63
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:03,526
- Many men get waxed these days. - Really?

64
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:06,336
Let's do this. I don't have much time anyway.

65
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,336
Please lie on your back. I'll start it shortly.

66
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:10,235
By the way, do you want me to get rid of this?

67
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,406
Just keep it. You'll need it.

68
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,675
Please take off your robe.

69
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,415
I'll start now.

70
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,686
Please bear the pain no matter what.

71
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:36,695
I'll get rid of the sheet.

72
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:39,536
What's happening now?

73
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:51,976
I guess that's why this is here.

74
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,045
You got waxed for real, right?

75
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,115
- Yes. - He got waxed for real.

76
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:02,156
He actually showed us his body after waxing...

77
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:05,256
in the bathroom.

78
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:09,925
- Yes. They were so curious. - We were curious.

79
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:11,735
- But... - Your legs?

80
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,466
how was it?

81
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,706
I heard you had all of your lower body waxed.

82
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:20,136
Waxing is... I'm kind of hairy.

83
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:21,706
I have a lot of facial hair too.

84
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:23,406
It was a waxing scene,

85
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,776
so I got waxed for real.

86
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,886
The next scene was supposed to be shot in a swimming pool.

87
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,915
I didn't know what I'd be wearing.

88
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:33,485
So after waxing my legs,

89
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:36,125
I couldn't decide how far I should go.

90
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,625
In the end, I went all the way up.

91
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,795
(Memories are coming back.)

92
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,696
- He looks so sad. - He sacrificed himself.

93
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:46,266
Let's watch it.

94
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:47,406
They've already watched it.

95
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:48,466
They have?

96
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:49,865
Did you see?

97
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,005
They've already watched it.

98
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:57,245
There's a scene I was very curious how they'd shoot.

99
00:04:57,245 --> 00:05:00,045
I like actor Han Ji Sang a lot.

100
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,985
So I was very curious about the school newspaper office scene.

101
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:08,026
(Seo Jin and Tae Hyun are locked in the reference room.)

102
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,226
I...

103
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:16,565
What is it?

104
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:18,795
You have...

105
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,435
something under the nose.

106
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:23,605
Is there something under my nose?

107
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:24,805
Yes.

108
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:25,875
One second.

109
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:34,315
Gosh, my mustache is growing again.

110
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:36,216
My razor is in my bag.

111
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,255
What's wrong?

112
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:43,425
It's nothing.

113
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:46,196
- It's some dust. - Is that so?

114
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:49,565
What I wanted to tell you is...

115
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:51,365
Don't come near me.

116
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:54,136
- What's wrong? - Don't come near me.

117
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:56,966
I must get out.

118
00:05:57,235 --> 00:05:59,605
Everything is over if he finds out.

119
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:04,846
(Seo Jin doesn't want Tae Hyun to see her mustache.)

120
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:06,346
Please help us.

121
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,545
- Help! - Hey.

122
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:11,815
- What's wrong, Seo Jin? - Don't come near me.

123
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:14,726
Hello?

124
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:16,586
Can anyone hear me?

125
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,255
We're locked in.

126
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,156
- Come back to senses. - Hello?

127
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:22,326
Please help us.

128
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:30,875
(It's been a while, but no one is coming.)

129
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:35,576
What will I do? It's getting thicker and thicker.

130
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,016
If he finds out I have a mustache, there'll be no future with him.

131
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:39,315
This is driving me crazy.

132
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:45,415
I'm sleepy.

133
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,685
Why am I so sleepy?

134
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:52,855
Wake up. I can't fall asleep.

135
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:54,665
There's no way I can fall asleep.

136
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,605
I must've dozed off for a while.

137
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:20,656
What is it?

138
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:23,125
- What are you doing? - Seo Jin. It's not what you think.

139
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,226
- I thought you'd be cold. - I told you not to come close.

140
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:30,295
Tae Hyun.

141
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:32,665
Tae Hyun. Wake up.

142
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,136
Tae Hyun. Forgive me. I'm sorry.

143
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:37,175
Please wake up.

144
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:39,276
Tae Hyun. Are you all right?

145
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:40,706
Are you conscious?

146
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,476
My head...

147
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,216
My head hurts.

148
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:52,786
Hey. Do you...

149
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:55,386
have a mustache?

150
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:01,495
I'm so sorry.

151
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:03,625
The scene I looked forward to the most was...

152
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,735
the one where Seo Jin hits Tae Hyun's head in the office...

153
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:09,906
and does the narration.

154
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,235
I was very worried about that scene.

155
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:16,076
It was the first scene where I had...

156
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,115
- a mustache. - That's right.

157
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,985
- It was in the beginning. - Back then,

158
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,315
it felt a bit awkward,

159
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:24,915
but it feels so natural now.

160
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:28,286
We see your mustache even when you don't have it.

161
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:29,755
I'm seeing it right now.

162
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:34,296
When Seo Jin fails her first job interview,

163
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:37,865
the others take her outside...

164
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:40,765
to cheer her up.

165
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:41,905
Jun Ki...

166
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,505
- and Seo Jin were in Rebecca. - Rebecca.

167
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,245
And Seo Jin punishes a bad guy.

168
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:53,216
Her arm was stuck in the car window,

169
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,916
and she ends up slapping the guy in the face unintentionally.

170
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:59,456
We put a lot of effort into that scene.

171
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:00,726
It was hard.

172
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,326
My arm...

173
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:04,226
- It was very hard. - hurt a lot.

174
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:07,365
In one of the first episodes,

175
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:11,765
Yoon Ah breastfeeds her baby.

176
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,096
I had forgotten about that scene.

177
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:15,206
- Right? - Was there a scene like that?

178
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:18,135
(Yoon Ah's first day at the guesthouse)

179
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,806
(Du Shik is puzzled because Sol won't stop crying.)

180
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:22,275
I can't make her stop.

181
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,576
Look at the time.

182
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:26,546
Thank you.

183
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,816
Were you hungry, Sol?

184
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:29,946
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,316
Let me feed you.

186
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,426
Two more toasts.

187
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,265
- That startled me. - What's going on?

188
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:43,865
- What? - What did you see?

189
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,336
- Did you see it? - No.

190
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,135
I told you that she makes people uncomfortable.

191
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:51,905
What's going on? That's strange.

192
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,275
What's wrong?

193
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,405
She can't suck on the milk.

194
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,976
Shall I make some baby formula?

195
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:01,615
No, she has a weak immune system.

196
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:03,515
I have to breastfeed her until she's a year old.

197
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:06,515
Do I have to pump my breast milk?

198
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,285
Pump?

199
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:10,655
I don't have a breast pump. I'm in trouble.

200
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:12,196
- What's a breast pump? - Do you know?

201
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,426
- What's a breast pump? - How would I know?

202
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:14,865
- Ask her. - Yoon Ah.

203
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:17,096
What's a breast pump?

204
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:18,296
It's...

205
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:21,035
a machine to pump breast milk.

206
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:24,105
We pump the breast milk when the baby can't suck.

207
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:27,676
Where can we find a breast pump?

208
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:28,905
Let me think.

209
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,046
They sell it at baby stores,

210
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,115
but they're quite expensive.

211
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,446
I don't have money.

212
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:37,115
When I read that scene...

213
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,186
in the script...

214
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,155
You didn't know how we were going to shoot it.

215
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:44,196
No. I was curious how we were going to shoot it.

216
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:46,056
But it became a very cute scene.

217
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:49,966
"What should we do?" Something like that.

218
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:53,666
Many ladies talked to me...

219
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,265
about that scene.

220
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:58,535
They thought it was so cute.

221
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:00,806
My favorite scene is...

222
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:04,346
in one of the first episodes. We buy Sol's baby formula,

223
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:07,716
and Jun Ki raises it high on the street.

224
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,385
(They win the baby formula war at the supermarket.)

225
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:38,546
(Jun Ki says a line from the movie, "New World".)

226
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:41,615
- Her face was completely pale. - I know.

227
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,785
(Du Shik also responses with a line from the same movie.)

228
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:50,025
It's a great day to have some formula.

229
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:52,655
We'll warm it up.

230
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:56,726
What are you doing?

231
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,466
Are you shooting a movie?

232
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:00,395
Come on. It's fun.

233
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:02,166
It was a fun shoot.

234
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,706
We looked great on screen...

235
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:06,076
even though we weren't supposed to look good.

236
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,245
The background music that we had chosen...

237
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:10,275
- was a song from "Goblin". - Right.

238
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,076
It was a scene from "Goblin".

239
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:14,346
It was a scene of three men.

240
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:18,115
We consider ourselves cool while others think that we're funny.

241
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:21,855
That's why I think it's a favorite scene.

242
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:24,096
My favorite scene...

243
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:25,755
isn't what was aired.

244
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,326
It was a favorite scene to shoot on the film set.

245
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:30,166
I don't laugh much on the film set.

246
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,196
I may make others laugh,

247
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:33,495
but I don't laugh often.

248
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:35,735
I shouldn't have laughed.

249
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,336
Do you remember Muharmusi?

250
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:43,476
Ta-da. How do I look, Jun Ki?

251
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:44,645
(Seo Jin shows off Muharmusi's clothes.)

252
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,485
You look like a beggar in warm clothes.

253
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,015
Did you give up looking for a job...

254
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,556
and start to beg?

255
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:51,755
A beggar?

256
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,316
These are luxury brands.

257
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:56,426
Muharmusi's 2017 Fall and Winter Vintage Collection.

258
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:58,025
What did you say?

259
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,355
Forget it. You don't know anything about fashion.

260
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,226
Forget it. I'm going to the library.

261
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,596
Stay warm.

262
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:05,495
Hello, Du Shik.

263
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:08,135
Hello, why are you dressed like a beggar in warm clothes?

264
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:10,405
Why do you have an onion net?

265
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:12,135
It's not an onion net.

266
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:13,976
It's from Muharmusi's 2017...

267
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:15,375
Muhar... What?

268
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:19,216
Forget it. I can't talk to you.

269
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:21,216
You have no idea about fashion.

270
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:23,216
What is she wearing?

271
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:25,186
Where did she pick up such trash?

272
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:27,686
If she kicks some cans, she'll look like a real beggar.

273
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:29,556
- It was so funny. - "A beggar in warm clothes"?

274
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:31,025
The original line was...

275
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,655
"You look like a beggar."

276
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:36,125
However, she was wearing a lot with an onion net.

277
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,166
So I said, "You look like a beggar with warm clothes."

278
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:41,865
- Then Du Shik came in. - I came in.

279
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,635
"Why are you dressed like a beggar in warm clothes?"

280
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,005
- It's so funny even now. - Right.

281
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:49,706
We meet her again at a bus stop.

282
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,446
(They see Seo Jin passed out at a bus stop.)

283
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:56,015
Wait. Isn't that Seo Jin?

284
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:57,385
I think it is.

285
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,586
You're right. Seo Jin.

286
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:05,155
- Wake up. - Leave me alone.

287
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:08,196
You don't know anything about fashion.

288
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:09,495
She reeks of alcohol.

289
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,235
Where on earth has she been drinking this early in the day?

290
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:16,066
My goodness. She even found a can to go with her outfit.

291
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,806
- Du Shik. - What is it now?

292
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:25,576
Look at this. It's money. It's money.

293
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:28,216
What? Why does she have cash in her can?

294
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,456
(They come across another temptation.)

295
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,285
Are you insisting we bet again with this money?

296
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:35,456
Have you really lost your mind, Jun Ki?

297
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:37,696
If the Almighty has any conscience, I'm sure he won't let us down.

298
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:40,625
Du Shik. Let's do it.

299
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:43,066
- Let's do this. - Shut your mouth.

300
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:45,535
You sound completely insane. Gosh.

301
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:49,235
All right. Forget it.

302
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:51,635
You won't be able to repay her deposit,

303
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:53,135
you won't be able to get married,

304
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:56,405
and you'll end up living the rest of your life doing one-sided love.

305
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,745
Forget it.

306
00:14:58,476 --> 00:14:59,515
I can't let that happen.

307
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:03,285
Then Du Shik, let's give it one last try.

308
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:07,525
Du Shik. Let's do it. Let's do this.

309
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:11,125
You're right. I can't live the rest of my life doing one-sided love.

310
00:15:11,596 --> 00:15:13,826
Let's do it. Let's do this.

311
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,336
Let's go. Hurry.

312
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,735
She does her best during rehearsals too.

313
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:27,775
While both of us are talking,

314
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:30,515
she doesn't have any lines. She just sits there drunk.

315
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,346
While we were practicing, she walked toward us.

316
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:34,985
She pretended to be drunk.

317
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:38,216
- During the rehearsal. - Rehearsal?

318
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:40,985
- She didn't want to surprise you. - I also did it during the shoot.

319
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:43,755
I think Muharmusi's beggar in warm clothes...

320
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:45,625
is hilarious.

321
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,328
(Collection of bloopers starts.)

322
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,367
- Action. - Action.

323
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:54,708
(Dong Gu is worried about a pervert who likes Yoon Ah.)

324
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:56,908
(Jun Ki is on a diet to prepare for an erotic scene.)

325
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:58,607
It's not like that.

326
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:02,347
- Your tongue is so long. - My tongue is long.

327
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:03,948
How is it so triangular?

328
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:05,577
My tongue can touch the nostrils.

329
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:08,948
He's gentle, and he even has a nice car.

330
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,317
That means he's competent.

331
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:12,787
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

332
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,188
Eat more pizza. I know you like it.

333
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,057
- Stop it. - She really hit him.

334
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,638
- He really ate it. - I did.

335
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:29,837
- He's so cute. - She should stop him.

336
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:34,547
Goodness.

337
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:40,118
The director thought it was funny, but it was a blooper as I ate it.

338
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:41,648
- Did you eat it? - Cut.

339
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,718
Goodness. That was so funny.

340
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:48,727
(Jun Ki makes Dong Gu and Yoon Ah get married by lying.)

341
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:50,827
Dong Gu and Yoon Ah should be home soon.

342
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:52,128
(The building owner is behind them.)

343
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,557
There's no need.

344
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:55,497
It wasn't even a real honeymoon. Why should we go see them arrive?

345
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:56,997
I think she's taking a photo.

346
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:59,868
Why did they have to meet Attorney Kim right then?

347
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:01,138
I know.

348
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:04,237
What if Dong Gu and Yoon Ah really grow fond of each other?

349
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:05,378
I doubt that.

350
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:08,448
Anyway, it's a relief the owner didn't find out.

351
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:12,118
Speaking of the owner,

352
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,948
(It's a blooper due to the noise.)

353
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,287
Speaking...

354
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,458
(Jun Ki continues acting.)

355
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,557
Speaking of the owner, don't you think that she's dense?

356
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:23,388
How could she believe that...

357
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:25,757
Dong Gu and Yoon Ah were a couple? Who would have imagined?

358
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:28,668
- How are they a couple? - What is that...

359
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:31,638
You startled me. I'm sorry. I turned around.

360
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,108
That wasn't it.

361
00:17:34,438 --> 00:17:35,507
Action.

362
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,708
(He has to miss the elevator.)

363
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,348
It kept opening up.

364
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:44,678
Wait, I love you. Please, please.

365
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,017
I got it.

366
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:49,517
- Action. - "I got it."

367
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,718
- It's Soo Ah's blooper. - What is it?

368
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:54,358
Dong Gu, say what's on your mind.

369
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,987
I'll do it again.

370
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:57,287
Action.

371
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,628
(This is how Soo Ah reacts to her bloopers.)

372
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:02,227
What's been wrong with you since yesterday?

373
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:03,827
Say what you want to say.

374
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,297
I don't have anything to say.

375
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,168
(Soo Ah's next line is...)

376
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:13,138
What's wrong with him since yesterday?

377
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,077
- Isn't it correct? - "Since yesterday".

378
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,618
May I do it again?

379
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,317
It wasn't since yesterday, right?

380
00:18:19,878 --> 00:18:23,218
- Gosh, she's so cute. - There you go again.

381
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:25,858
You aren't getting a foot massage since you're worried about me.

382
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,287
No.

383
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:30,158
It's not because of you.

384
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:31,257
Then why...

385
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:35,668
She's so cute.

386
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,468
(Jun Ki is caught by Writer Kwon's boyfriend.)

387
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:40,938
- I finally caught you. - This was hilarious.

388
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:43,507
- Gosh, it was funny. - How dare you steal my girlfriend?

389
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,337
I was holding on to the towel really tightly.

390
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:46,908
Let me see your face.

391
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:48,477
It's "The Legend of Zorro".

392
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:51,517
- He tried to tear it. - What happened?

393
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:52,848
- Is that what happened? - He tore it.

394
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,448
What? You punk.

395
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:57,987
Let me see. Are you from "The Legend of Zorro"?

396
00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:59,087
You jerk.

397
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:01,527
(Jun Ki laughs at the ad-lib.)

398
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:03,027
He's laughing.

399
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,297
How did he tear it like that?

400
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:07,358
It stayed covering my eyes after he tore it.

401
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,297
Can we stop from here?

402
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:12,468
- Please. I'm sorry. - Cut.

403
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:18,577
He tore a lot of it.

404
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:20,108
(Two actors do their best.)

405
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:25,577
The towel didn't tear.

406
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:30,388
Gosh, it must have been hard.

407
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:31,688
How dare you steal my girlfriend?

408
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:35,358
Let me see your face.

409
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:37,458
What? Take it off.

410
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,858
Take it off.

411
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:42,567
- Let's start again. - He wanted...

412
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,027
- to stop. - Let's start again.

413
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,898
(They continue acting.)

414
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:48,267
Die.

415
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,668
He couldn't tear it this time.

416
00:19:51,977 --> 00:19:53,138
My goodness.

417
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:55,577
I'll do it again.

418
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,118
Are you going on a date today?

419
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:01,448
(Du Shik thinks that Dong Gu still has feelings for Soo Ah.)

420
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:04,158
You should let go of Soo Ah, Dong Gu.

421
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,218
- Look at his face. - Be quiet, you jerk!

422
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:07,587
Do you know how I feel?

423
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:10,027
Darn it. What's wrong with you?

424
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:14,098
- This is funny. - Why is he...

425
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,468
always so mean to me?

426
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:20,198
(Seo Jin burnt off Jun Ki's eyebrow.)

427
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:21,307
What's this?

428
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,507
- I'm sorry. - We shot it recently.

429
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:24,977
- Yes. - What is it?

430
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,378
- Wait, Seo Jin. - What is it?

431
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:30,408
(Jun Ki takes revenge on Seo Jin.)

432
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,777
Does it fall off?

433
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:36,787
Good luck on your interview. I always cheer for you.

434
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:38,458
You can do it.

435
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:40,987
Oh, thank you.

436
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,458
He's ad-libbing.

437
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,128
- High five. - It's your turn next.

438
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,198
Does it fall off?

439
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:48,168
- No, it doesn't. - No.

440
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:50,128
That must've been an ad-lib.

441
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:53,198
Did you see that?

442
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,977
Beware. It could happen to you too.

443
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:06,247
Beware. It could happen to you too.

444
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,378
- What's this? - This was where you two kissed.

445
00:21:08,087 --> 00:21:09,188
Oh, dear.

446
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:11,958
Thanks to you, I didn't feel too uncomfortable shooting this.

447
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:13,987
We both had eaten food right before kissing.

448
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:16,787
(Seo Jin heart suddenly flutters because of Jun Ki.)

449
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:17,898
Where was that bar?

450
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:19,628
- It was probably... - Sangam-dong?

451
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:21,428
- Yes, Sangam-dong. - It was a nice bar.

452
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,727
- I can't seem to understand. - That bar was really nice.

453
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:26,668
What's so great about this guy?

454
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,237
(She takes a close look at Jun Ki.)

455
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:29,507
Do you how someone commented on this scene?

456
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:31,438
One person thought we were speaking in German.

457
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:34,037
German? That's hilarious.

458
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:37,108
My heart actually fluttered a bit when I saw the preview.

459
00:21:37,307 --> 00:21:38,348
- Really? - Didn't you?

460
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:39,418
Do you really have feelings for him?

461
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:43,547
A peck like a... No, was it a kiss like a peck?

462
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:44,787
- It was a peck like a kiss. - He's right.

463
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:47,628
Whether it was a peck-like kiss or the other way around...

464
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:49,858
Never mind.

465
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:51,198
So did you do either one?

466
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:54,198
No, nothing actually happened, but I had fun doing the shoot.

467
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:56,227
(Jun Ki livens the mood by ad-libbing.)

468
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,267
He must've forgotten his line.

469
00:21:57,638 --> 00:21:59,638
No, it wasn't that. I was ad-libbing.

470
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:02,307
- Give us another bottle of soju. - Here they go. Here they go.

471
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:07,208
Viewers commented that they could see my mustache even then.

472
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:09,148
Viewers say this is love between the hairy and bare...

473
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:11,418
because she has a mustache and I have no hair.

474
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:13,348
You'll need some ointment.

475
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:15,848
I'm sure you're skin feels rough.

476
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,718
Now, the best episode we'll be seeing today...

477
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,688
is episode six, "You're Crazy To Get Married".

478
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,527
We have no reservations again this week.

479
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:32,368
Why don't we have any guests these days?

480
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:33,938
Could it be because the weather's too cold?

481
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,938
What if we end up going out of business?

482
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:37,638
I'm worried.

483
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,277
Yesterday, the owner called again and demanded the rent.

484
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,648
Do you remember how she sent a certification of contents?

485
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:44,878
- Hey. There's no need to worry. - Hi.

486
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:46,047
- You guys were startled. - Yes.

487
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:49,188
Ms. Kim.

488
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:50,987
What brings you here?

489
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:52,587
- Du Shik. What did you do? - I was eating chips.

490
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:54,057
I had some in my mouth.

491
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:59,358
- You see, business is slow. - So you don't have the money?

492
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:01,468
You may begin.

493
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:02,868
- Begin what? - Begin what?

494
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:04,938
- Who are you? - Can we help you?

495
00:23:05,098 --> 00:23:07,067
After shooting this scene,

496
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,767
I ran into that attorney at a cafe.

497
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,077
- By chance? - Yes, by chance.

498
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,307
- Really? Did you say hello? - Yes, I did.

499
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:14,977
It must've been so awkward.

500
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,678
It was.

501
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:19,077
I did another drama with him before.

502
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,017
Please, not on that.

503
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,317
(You're Crazy To Get Married)

504
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:26,918
- The subtitles are designed nicely. - I agree.

505
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:27,987
I'm home.

506
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:30,688
It would be nice to see them all together.

507
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:33,658
- Ms. Kim. - It's been a long time, Mr. Kang.

508
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:36,898
- Where did that baby come from? - Excuse me?

509
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:40,198
- This is where it starts. - You're eyes.

510
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:42,267
- Look at his face. - He's rolling his eyes again.

511
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,708
- The public fraud scheme begins. - The public fraud scheme.

512
00:23:47,477 --> 00:23:49,448
This is right before when...

513
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,348
- Soo Ah comes to the house, right. - It's Jun Ki's.

514
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:55,087
- This baby's Mr. Kang's child? - Yes.

515
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:59,158
Business is slow, and on top of that, we have a baby now.

516
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:00,928
We need to buy diapers and powered formula.

517
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:03,087
You can't imagine how much money goes into the baby.

518
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,128
Actually, we had the money we owe you saved up,

519
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,628
but we had to use it for the baby.

520
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:12,468
We're completely broke now.

521
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:15,007
Oh, dear. I see.

522
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,537
- I'll kill you. - I'm sorry.

523
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:19,938
But where's the baby's mother?

524
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:22,178
The baby's mother?

525
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:24,718
The mother...

526
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:26,718
You see...

527
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:27,787
She ran away.

528
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,718
- How does he make those faces? - She refused to raise the child.

529
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:38,398
How could a mother possibly do that?

530
00:24:39,698 --> 00:24:40,767
You're right.

531
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:42,668
If you say so, we have no choice but to leave.

532
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:45,368
However, if we get kicked out in this cold weather,

533
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:49,108
we'll be able to survive, but what about the baby?

534
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:51,037
What about this poor baby?

535
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,977
- Oh, dear. - My goodness.

536
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,618
Then according to the law, we'll have you evicted.

537
00:24:58,618 --> 00:24:59,777
Attorney Kim. That's enough.

538
00:25:00,888 --> 00:25:02,648
I'll give you one more month. That's all.

539
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:05,587
Ms. Jeon Soo Kyung is actually a very kind person.

540
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,158
This was my first time working with her.

541
00:25:07,158 --> 00:25:09,128
Really? Thank you, Ms. Kim.

542
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:10,898
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

543
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:13,757
- Stop it. Take care of the baby. - We will.

544
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:14,997
Let's go, Attorney Kim.

545
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:19,267
You poor little thing.

546
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:24,477
Thank you.

547
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:25,977
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

548
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:27,708
- Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye.

549
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:30,817
I was afraid we'd really get kicked out.

550
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:33,577
Even so, how could you lie about something like this?

551
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:34,648
Do you have a better idea?

552
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,987
Don't you see all those red stickers everywhere?

553
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:39,158
If I didn't come up with this, we'd be out on the streets.

554
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,128
What if she finds out?

555
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:42,287
How would she find out?

556
00:25:42,428 --> 00:25:44,527
It's not like she'll check our resident registration.

557
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,158
What will we do now?

558
00:25:47,468 --> 00:25:50,737
We'll be okay this month, but what will we do next month?

559
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:54,638
That's right. When we have a lot of lines, it gets really tough.

560
00:25:54,868 --> 00:25:58,708
But there's always a character that doesn't have lines in each scene.

561
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,307
That character just needs to react to others' lines.

562
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:01,777
It's been a long time.

563
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,148
That was the first time I actually meet Soo Ah on the set.

564
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:04,148
You're right.

565
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:06,848
How's Dong Gu doing?

566
00:26:07,118 --> 00:26:08,747
- It was freezing that day. - Look at him.

567
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:11,358
It was so cold that day.

568
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:12,458
I put my house on the market.

569
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:15,487
Yoon Seok's planning on opening a few more branches in the States.

570
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:17,458
- Our mouths are numb. - How long will you be there?

571
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:19,297
Maybe 1 or 2 years?

572
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:21,997
I could even possibly settle down there.

573
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:24,668
- I have a lot to get done. - She's so nasty.

574
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:25,797
I should get going.

575
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:27,408
- Take care. - All right.

576
00:26:27,408 --> 00:26:28,638
- Goodbye. - You're eyes look frozen.

577
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:30,067
- Right. My eyes were swollen. - They were swollen?

578
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:34,178
What if she actually ends up getting married to that guy?

579
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,348
It was really cold at the time.

580
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:37,178
The outfit you were wearing was so light.

581
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:38,648
- You didn't even have a coat on. - That's right.

582
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:40,848
- My lips were numb. - It was cold...

583
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:42,348
- My lips wouldn't move. - and we all met for the first time.

584
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:44,688
Hey. Isn't that the owner's car?

585
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:46,817
Yes. I think it is.

586
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,888
Wait. Why is it headed towards our guesthouse?

587
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:52,757
Something doesn't seem right.

588
00:26:54,468 --> 00:26:55,797
I'm home.

589
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:56,997
- Hello, Yoon Ah. - Hi.

590
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,198
What about your wisdom tooth?

591
00:26:58,198 --> 00:26:59,368
- Did you take it out? - Yes.

592
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:02,237
But...

593
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,037
what's all this?

594
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:07,807
Something happened while you were gone.

595
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:09,848
I'll tell you about it later.

596
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:13,418
- Does it hurt a lot? - No.

597
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:20,057
- I wish it'd stop bleeding though. - It bleeds a lot normally.

598
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:22,327
It was a cotton ball. According to the script,

599
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:25,128
I was supposed to spit, but the director told me not to.

600
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:27,928
He told me to take out the cotton ball.

601
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:29,468
Where were the extra cotton balls?

602
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:31,398
Sol must've been worried. She keeps looking at you.

603
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,797
- I guess. - Sol makes good eye contact.

604
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:35,837
Welcome. Are you here to stay for the night?

605
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:36,908
Please pretend for us.

606
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:38,337
I'm not a guest.

607
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:41,307
Who are you?

608
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:43,708
Pardon? My names is Han Yoon Ah.

609
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:46,918
Sol, what's wrong. Are you hungry?

610
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:48,388
Do you want Mommy to feed you?

611
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:50,087
Mommy?

612
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,987
Are you saying you're the baby's mother?

613
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:54,557
When did you come back?

614
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:58,458
Excuse me? I just got back from the hospital.

615
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,527
"The hospital"?

616
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,267
This scene was really long, wasn't it?

617
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:03,327
Yes. It was a complicated scene too.

618
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:06,468
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Hold on!

619
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:08,138
You startled me.

620
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:10,837
Why are you screaming all of a sudden?

621
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:11,977
I'm sorry, Ms. Kim.

622
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:14,708
But what brings you here again?

623
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,618
I couldn't stop thinking about the baby.

624
00:28:18,017 --> 00:28:19,418
I bought some diapers for her.

625
00:28:19,418 --> 00:28:21,087
What's all this noise. Is someone here?

626
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:22,587
- Oh, dear. Ms. Kim - Mr. Kang.

627
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:24,787
When did you find the baby's mother?

628
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,858
Well, you see...

629
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,428
- You see... - Anyway,

630
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:30,388
why was the mother in the hospital?

631
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:33,428
- The hospital? - The hospital?

632
00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:35,797
We were told that she was brought to the hospital after passing out,

633
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,398
so we brought her over here.

634
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:39,497
- That's what happened. - She passed out?

635
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:41,168
How are you sick?

636
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:43,408
Pardon? I was just...

637
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:46,007
- Oh, dear. - My goodness.

638
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:47,208
She could pass as a hemoptysis patient.

639
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:49,108
Gosh. It's starting again.

640
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:52,577
Didn't you end up swallowing some?

641
00:28:52,777 --> 00:28:54,047
You poured a lot into your mouth.

642
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:56,218
It seems like taking extreme measures...

643
00:28:56,948 --> 00:29:00,787
The viewers like to see absurd things.

644
00:29:01,027 --> 00:29:02,827
They enjoy nonsense.

645
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:04,727
They like groundless humor.

646
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:07,468
My goodness.

647
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:10,128
The viewers get it because that's how our drama is.

648
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,668
- It really doesn't make any sense. - It's all really nonsense.

649
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,507
We shouldn't be standing here like this.

650
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:16,007
- Let's get her to the hospital. - No. That won't be needed.

651
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,977
- Why? - Well, you see,

652
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:20,977
the doctor said she doesn't have a chance. That's why...

653
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:22,678
- we brought her home. - What?

654
00:29:24,777 --> 00:29:26,517
Then are you telling me she has a terminal disease?

655
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:27,948
Pardon?

656
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:30,547
Well, yes. That's right.

657
00:29:31,557 --> 00:29:32,888
She's in her late stage?

658
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:35,658
Yes. That's right.

659
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:39,827
How could such a thing happen to such a young lady?

660
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:44,138
This must be so hard for you.

661
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:45,638
Pardon?

662
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:48,638
- Yes, it is. - Treat her well.

663
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:51,477
Make sure you take good care of her.

664
00:29:53,237 --> 00:29:56,408
By the way, did you two hold a marriage ceremony?

665
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:57,547
A marriage ceremony?

666
00:29:57,977 --> 00:29:59,448
- Well, you see... - I guess...

667
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:02,547
you wouldn't have had the time to hold one.

668
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:06,817
I feel so bad for the baby's mother.

669
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,327
She'll die without being able to wear a wedding dress.

670
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:19,537
Hang in there, Mr. Kang.

671
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,608
I will. Thank you.

672
00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:23,737
He's doing that thing with his eyes again.

673
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,247
I'll be going now.

674
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:31,317
This way, ma'am.

675
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,747
Thank you for the diapers. Goodbye.

676
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:37,047
Goodbye.

677
00:30:41,227 --> 00:30:42,358
Gosh. That was close.

678
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:45,497
This is all your fault. Why did you have to lie?

679
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:46,997
We were able to get away with it, weren't we?

680
00:30:46,997 --> 00:30:49,428
We'll be all right. Don't worry.

681
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:50,737
What if we get caught?

682
00:30:50,737 --> 00:30:52,237
I'll carry these inside.

683
00:30:52,237 --> 00:30:54,037
You want that?

684
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:56,668
That was one scene. But it's not over yet.

685
00:30:58,237 --> 00:30:59,678
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

686
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:02,648
What do you think about this?

687
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:04,577
What is this?

688
00:31:05,517 --> 00:31:08,418
I want to help you with your wedding.

689
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,087
- What? A wedding? - What? A wedding?

690
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:13,458
Don't worry. I'll pay for it.

691
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:16,327
It's fine. Really, it's okay.

692
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:18,727
You don't know how women think.

693
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:21,468
If a woman never gets to wear a wedding dress,

694
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:23,027
she'll regret it forever.

695
00:31:23,027 --> 00:31:24,438
No, it's fine.

696
00:31:24,438 --> 00:31:26,567
I don't need to wear a wedding dress.

697
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:29,067
I want to do it for you.

698
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,277
In fact, I was so busy with my life...

699
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:35,608
that I got married to my husband without the wedding ceremony.

700
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:38,178
I never had a chance to wear a wedding dress.

701
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:41,017
I didn't know.

702
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:43,817
That's why I know how you feel.

703
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:47,527
Don't feel pressured. You should have a wedding.

704
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:51,727
It's fine. We don't need one.

705
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,997
Are you going to reject my kindness like that?

706
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:56,027
Then don't do it.

707
00:31:56,368 --> 00:31:57,938
But you should give up the store.

708
00:31:57,938 --> 00:31:59,737
What? I...

709
00:31:59,737 --> 00:32:01,507
- She's a tyrant. - Make a decision.

710
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:03,807
Do you want to give up the store or get married?

711
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,507
This is how typical Waikiki story goes.

712
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:09,378
That's true.

713
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:11,517
- We'll do it.. - "We'll do it."

714
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:12,848
We will.

715
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:14,718
You should have said that from the start.

716
00:32:14,718 --> 00:32:16,648
- They have no opinions in this. - No.

717
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,487
The faster, the better, right?

718
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:20,317
How about on Sunday?

719
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,628
This Sunday?

720
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:27,327
You don't know what will happen to her. The faster the better, right?

721
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:33,297
I... Yes.

722
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:36,608
What? She'll give you a wedding ceremony?

723
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,837
Yes.

724
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:40,638
Why did you lie and make things go this bad?

725
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:42,547
I didn't know this would happen.

726
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:45,817
I don't think this is right. This is deception.

727
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:48,517
I think I need to tell her the truth.

728
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:51,257
- Hey! Are you out of your mind? - What?

729
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:52,817
Don't you know what she's like?

730
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:54,428
If she finds out that you've been lying,

731
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:56,958
she won't just kick us out. She'll sue us.

732
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,497
Then what should we do?

733
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:01,968
He reacted really well.

734
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:04,737
Every time I do something, he continues the situation very well.

735
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:08,408
You should just have a wedding.

736
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:10,067
- Jun Ki. - Are you out of your mind?

737
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:12,978
- Then what should we do? - He hit my neck.

738
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:15,948
We can't lose our house and get kicked out to the streets.

739
00:33:18,348 --> 00:33:21,748
I think the male actors should all get their vocal cords examined.

740
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:23,047
- I think so too. - With Yoon Ah...

741
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:24,158
All of you should.

742
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:25,888
Just have a wedding.

743
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,587
No, don't! Don't!

744
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:32,428
After that, he flinches every time he sees Jung Hyun.

745
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:35,728
- He's scary. - I really want to do this for you.

746
00:33:35,728 --> 00:33:36,998
Go ahead and choose something.

747
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:40,638
This was the first shooting in Gangnam.

748
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:42,538
Dong Gu?

749
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:44,808
Sang Pil?

750
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:47,478
We had this shooting and the one at Jamsil.

751
00:33:47,848 --> 00:33:50,678
It's been a long time. How have you been?

752
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:52,718
I've been all right.

753
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:55,248
The actor is playing Sang Pil,

754
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:58,187
- and he looks like a Sang Pil. - Yes.

755
00:33:58,187 --> 00:34:01,288
- I... I didn't know who it was. - Sang Pil.

756
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:03,388
How about this one for the bride and the bridegroom?

757
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:05,127
It's really popular these days.

758
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,627
He fits the name Sang Pil perfectly.

759
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,067
Bride and bridegroom?

760
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:10,667
What's this? Are you getting married?

761
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:13,297
Well, that is...

762
00:34:17,437 --> 00:34:19,737
Yes, I'm getting married.

763
00:34:19,737 --> 00:34:22,007
Why didn't you tell us? When is it?

764
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:23,948
It's...

765
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:28,248
this Sunday.

766
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:30,957
You should have told us. Gosh.

767
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:33,158
Don't worry.

768
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,957
I'll get all our friends, seniors, juniors,

769
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:38,498
professors, and even club members.

770
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:41,098
Congratulations, Dong Gu.

771
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:44,237
Well, thanks.

772
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:48,368
I feel like crying, you jerk.

773
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,408
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

774
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:55,448
Why did I have to meet Sang Pil there? Gosh, Sang Pil

775
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:56,607
Sergeant Kang?

776
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:00,748
- Corporal Kim. - Sir.

777
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,187
How have you been?

778
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,618
I'm doing fine. I haven't seen you in a while.

779
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:07,627
Mr. Kang, what do you think?

780
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:10,928
You should wear a tuxedo to your wedding, right?

781
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,828
- Yes. - A wedding?

782
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:14,928
Are you getting married?

783
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:17,638
I... It's...

784
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,368
- The music is just perfect. - I'm getting married.

785
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:24,808
- The timing is just perfect. - When?

786
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:27,707
- The viewers would love it too. - You should have told me before.

787
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,678
Don't be disappointed.

788
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:32,877
There's a reason why he couldn't tell you.

789
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:34,187
A reason?

790
00:35:34,888 --> 00:35:36,047
What reason?

791
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:40,087
Really?

792
00:35:40,828 --> 00:35:42,957
Gosh, how did that happen?

793
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:44,728
Cheer up, Sergeant Kang.

794
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,698
Yes, thank you.

795
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,198
But you're really...

796
00:35:48,198 --> 00:35:50,968
I think they all started losing weight from this moment.

797
00:35:50,968 --> 00:35:53,598
- Gosh, it's nothing. - And Dong Gu looks tired.

798
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:56,837
I just want these two to be happy.

799
00:35:56,837 --> 00:36:01,777
Anyhow, I'll contact all the members of the army.

800
00:36:01,777 --> 00:36:04,547
- No. - No, you don't need to do that.

801
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:07,218
Gosh, we should stay together in times of need.

802
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:09,487
That's what friends are for, right?

803
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:10,857
Cheer up.

804
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:15,757
- Right. Thanks. - So many things happened.

805
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,857
You're all about caring for your friends,

806
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:19,797
- you scum. - This is only the first half.

807
00:36:19,998 --> 00:36:21,397
- The half. - It's just the beginning.

808
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:23,067
There is more to come.

809
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:24,337
- This is only a part. - It becomes worse.

810
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:26,198
There are many left to come.

811
00:36:26,837 --> 00:36:29,107
- I really liked what you said. - This is when we were at Jamsil.

812
00:36:29,107 --> 00:36:31,408
- Here? - Yes, we finished it within a day.

813
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:37,618
We had to shoot in front of a Thai restaurant.

814
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:41,187
It was really cold then.

815
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:46,687
You could see our breaths as if they're two dragons,

816
00:36:47,558 --> 00:36:49,658
just before we meet Soo Ah.

817
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:52,198
- I was so happy to be on the bus. - Yes.

818
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:53,928
- It was so warm. - It was warm.

819
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:56,928
So the director bought us ice cream.

820
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:58,498
- Why? - Because it got warm.

821
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:01,567
We bought ice cream because it got warmer.

822
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:03,638
We had so much to do today...

823
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,207
- Are those the staffs in the back? - Yes.

824
00:37:07,377 --> 00:37:10,248
- They're the make-up staffs. - I didn't know they were there.

825
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:13,547
- It looks natural. - It does.

826
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:16,047
What? She already fell asleep?

827
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:17,487
He's sweet here.

828
00:37:19,218 --> 00:37:21,728
Sweet Dong Gu's sweetness. Sweet Kang.

829
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:23,257
Kang Sweet.

830
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:26,728
- Right at that moment. - Gosh.

831
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:38,908
(Designs for Wedding Dresses)

832
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:43,308
I like scenes like this.

833
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:46,448
(Lydia)

834
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:50,587
- She chose that one. - It's cute.

835
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:57,187
Gosh.

836
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:03,527
Gosh, she always needs my help.

837
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:08,507
If I were him, I'd have opened the window.

838
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:11,277
- So that she'd fall outside. - Fall outside?

839
00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:12,578
"Fall to the other side."

840
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,377
The bridegroom is here.

841
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,218
I was just joking.

842
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:20,678
I wanted to make you feel better.

843
00:38:20,678 --> 00:38:21,848
Do you feel like joking?

844
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:23,848
Do you know what happened to me today?

845
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:26,957
Do you know what's happening because of you?

846
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:29,228
Wait. What is this?

847
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,728
- Isn't this the boss? - What is it?

848
00:38:31,928 --> 00:38:33,457
There's an article about her.

849
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:35,067
An article? What article?

850
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:38,337
"The good deeds of Mrs. Kim from Huam-dong brings us warmth."

851
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:41,067
"She promised to get Kang Dong Gu and Han Yoon Ah a wedding,"

852
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,808
"a couple who runs a guesthouse..."

853
00:38:42,808 --> 00:38:44,578
"but can't even afford their rent."

854
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:48,808
What? Who... Who wrote this article? Who is this?

855
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:51,277
Reporter Kim Tae Yong? That's...

856
00:38:51,277 --> 00:38:53,618
I became a reporter.

857
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:56,248
Why did that scum write this?

858
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:58,158
Why did he? Gosh.

859
00:38:58,158 --> 00:39:00,158
- Hello. This is Waikiki. - That's not normal.

860
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:01,187
Hello?

861
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:03,457
Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Wheesung.

862
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:05,928
What? Wheesung the singer?

863
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:06,998
- Wheesung? - You have the wrong number.

864
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:09,728
I'm really Wheesung. Really.

865
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:11,038
Really?

866
00:39:11,397 --> 00:39:13,567
Hello, I'm Park Hyo Shin.

867
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:16,207
Do you want to have a singing battle with me?

868
00:39:16,207 --> 00:39:18,937
A good person

869
00:39:19,277 --> 00:39:21,647
Even when we break up

870
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:23,707
Gosh, don't make prank calls.

871
00:39:23,707 --> 00:39:25,248
I even thought

872
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:27,178
About getting married to you

873
00:39:30,957 --> 00:39:33,218
You sound the same. What's this about?

874
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:35,388
You read the article?

875
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:41,397
What? You want to sing at the wedding?

876
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:44,237
- It's Wheesung? - Wheesung, wait a moment.

877
00:39:44,237 --> 00:39:46,198
- There's another incoming call. - This was all an ad-lib.

878
00:39:46,198 --> 00:39:47,507
Hello, this is the Waikiki.

879
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:50,007
He even talked about Kim Yu Na.

880
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,138
- It gets worse. - In the end,

881
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:53,707
- it got really serious. - Even Park Tae Hwan.

882
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:55,047
You shouldn't forget the chefs.

883
00:39:56,047 --> 00:39:57,547
He even mentioned the Blue House.

884
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:00,047
Really?

885
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:01,748
He said we could have a wedding in the Blue House.

886
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,917
- Poor him. - Chef Lee Yeon Bok?

887
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,218
Even Chef Lee Yeon Bok.

888
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:11,527
(Wedding Hall)

889
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:12,998
Wedding.

890
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:14,768
(We don't accept money.)

891
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,598
(Congratulations on Your Wedding)

892
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:20,538
All the staffs' names are on the decorations.

893
00:40:20,538 --> 00:40:22,638
Really?

894
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:23,707
The names on the tags?

895
00:40:23,707 --> 00:40:25,207
- You really brought everyone. - Yes.

896
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:26,678
Look at him.

897
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:27,877
Thank you.

898
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:30,707
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

899
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:32,618
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

900
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:36,917
Let's salute to him.

901
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,018
Salute to the new bridegroom.

902
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:40,288
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

903
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:41,888
- At ease. - Thanks.

904
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:44,527
- Sergeant Kang. - Corporal Kim.

905
00:40:45,297 --> 00:40:47,527
- I read the newspaper article. - Congratulations.

906
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:49,397
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

907
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,038
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

908
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:53,268
- You are the new groom! - You are so handsome.

909
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,207
Your daughter is adorable.

910
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:58,408
It's so chaotic.

911
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:01,507
They all had different styles.

912
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,147
Are you okay, Dong Gu?

913
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:04,848
Do I look okay to you?

914
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:08,317
Friends back in school, professors, and even the commander...

915
00:41:08,317 --> 00:41:10,817
Even the leader of the women's association is here.

916
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:14,087
I'm officially married. I'm a married man.

917
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:16,587
But everyone's complimenting about how beautiful your bride is.

918
00:41:17,158 --> 00:41:18,257
He's so insensitive.

919
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:20,998
- Right. - She looks amazing.

920
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:22,998
She's gorgeous. So what?

921
00:41:23,468 --> 00:41:25,067
Do I have to be happy because I have a beautiful bride?

922
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:28,408
I don't even know what to do because of how happy I am.

923
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:32,277
That's when our teamwork started getting better.

924
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:33,437
It's all because of you.

925
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:34,748
We started responding to each other very well.

926
00:41:34,848 --> 00:41:35,948
We had become close.

927
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:37,277
What are you guys doing?

928
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:40,248
It's time to begin the ceremony.

929
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:41,917
Come in.

930
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:44,317
- Of course. - Right, it's time to begin.

931
00:41:44,487 --> 00:41:46,087
I have to go now.

932
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:47,957
- I'll be there. - See you soon.

933
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:49,487
- Are you really going? - Good luck.

934
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:50,627
Good luck.

935
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,737
It's time to begin...

936
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:02,067
Kang Dong Gu...

937
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:05,507
and Han Yoon Ah's...

938
00:42:05,808 --> 00:42:07,578
wedding ceremony.

939
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:10,348
Here comes the groom!

940
00:42:19,618 --> 00:42:20,788
Dong Gu!

941
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,457
Congratulations!

942
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:25,098
That's my boy!

943
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:27,328
He's handsome!

944
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:29,027
Look how happy he is.

945
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:30,098
She's so cute.

946
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,468
Did it take long to shoot this?

947
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:35,237
That day...

948
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:37,308
- Not as long as I expected. - No.

949
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:40,207
All right. It's time to...

950
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:42,178
There were a few scenes.

951
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:44,277
It didn't take that long.

952
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:46,317
- It took an afternoon. - 3 to 4 hours?

953
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:48,118
- What? - Did it take 4 to 5 hours?

954
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:49,647
- A bit longer. - It took longer.

955
00:42:50,187 --> 00:42:51,957
- Here comes the bride! - I mean inside the wedding hall.

956
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:55,187
It took a day.

957
00:42:55,428 --> 00:42:56,527
Here she comes.

958
00:42:57,428 --> 00:42:59,498
- She looks beautiful. - She looks so beautiful.

959
00:42:59,498 --> 00:43:02,397
It was my first wedding scene ever.

960
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:04,167
- Really? - Yes.

961
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:05,567
It was the first time...

962
00:43:05,797 --> 00:43:07,667
I had ever worn a wedding dress in a drama.

963
00:43:07,937 --> 00:43:09,808
- You've worn it somewhere else? - You've worn it somewhere else?

964
00:43:11,178 --> 00:43:12,337
It sounds weird.

965
00:43:12,678 --> 00:43:14,038
If it was the first time in a drama...

966
00:43:14,038 --> 00:43:15,647
It was the first wedding dress in my life.

967
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:16,978
You've worn it a few times in real life?

968
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:18,518
I said it wrong.

969
00:43:22,618 --> 00:43:24,687
I can understand why he'd fall in love with her. Look at her.

970
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:28,487
- It was so exhausting. - Why?

971
00:43:28,587 --> 00:43:31,228
In the behind-the-scene clip,

972
00:43:31,797 --> 00:43:34,828
I'm panting. The dress was so tight.

973
00:43:35,228 --> 00:43:37,228
- I couldn't breathe. - Because of your belly fat?

974
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:39,038
Because of her ribs...

975
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:41,237
Look me in the eye.

976
00:43:44,308 --> 00:43:46,507
You look so beautiful.

977
00:43:46,578 --> 00:43:48,178
You look so gorgeous.

978
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:50,078
Chewbacca, you should try it too.

979
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:53,817
- We have 20 episodes now. - No.

980
00:43:53,817 --> 00:43:56,547
Over my dead body.

981
00:43:57,558 --> 00:43:58,957
Kang Dong Gu!

982
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:02,757
Right.

983
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:10,868
That laughter...

984
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:15,167
Love is delicious, it's bathed in moonlight

985
00:44:15,908 --> 00:44:18,078
It was Wheesung's first appearance in a drama, right?

986
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:20,978
I thought he had made many appearances before.

987
00:44:20,978 --> 00:44:23,707
He did a great job.

988
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:25,317
Doesn't he look a bit nervous?

989
00:44:26,948 --> 00:44:29,618
- He has a lot of experiences. - Jun Ki...

990
00:44:29,888 --> 00:44:31,058
Many different experiences.

991
00:44:31,288 --> 00:44:32,357
Thank you.

992
00:44:33,457 --> 00:44:35,987
- He looks like a seal. - Congratulations on your wedding.

993
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:38,498
I wish you a happy life.

994
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:40,968
Many people say that you look like Wheesung.

995
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:43,468
He's heard that a lot.

996
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:46,337
To make up for that, I'd like them...

997
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:49,538
to give each other a passionate kiss.

998
00:44:52,337 --> 00:44:53,908
- Kiss? - You want us to kiss?

999
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:55,348
A passionate kiss.

1000
00:44:55,948 --> 00:44:57,348
That's so Welcome to Waikiki.

1001
00:44:57,678 --> 00:44:59,178
Kiss!

1002
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:00,888
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1003
00:45:01,218 --> 00:45:02,618
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1004
00:45:02,817 --> 00:45:04,317
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1005
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:06,158
- Kiss! - My goodness.

1006
00:45:06,158 --> 00:45:07,687
- I think I'll go crazy. - Kiss!

1007
00:45:07,928 --> 00:45:09,487
- Kiss! - What are you doing?

1008
00:45:09,928 --> 00:45:11,498
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1009
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:13,428
- Kiss! - Hurry up!

1010
00:45:13,658 --> 00:45:15,198
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1011
00:45:15,527 --> 00:45:17,027
- Kiss! - Kiss!

1012
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,937
- Kiss! - Dong Gu. Let's just do it.

1013
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:22,507
- Do what? - Let's just go ahead and kiss.

1014
00:45:22,937 --> 00:45:24,808
How could we possibly kiss in front of everyone?

1015
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:29,248
My goodness.

1016
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:31,147
- She kissed me. - To watch this with everyone,

1017
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:32,647
it feels weird.

1018
00:45:34,587 --> 00:45:36,487
We didn't make any mistakes.

1019
00:45:37,288 --> 00:45:38,457
It didn't take long.

1020
00:45:38,718 --> 00:45:39,857
It's so pretty.

1021
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:43,187
The light and everything.

1022
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:46,857
- Everyone's skin looks so fair. - I love their height difference.

1023
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:47,968
It's perfect.

1024
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:51,098
When Yoon Ah was in Dong Gu's arms at the supermarket,

1025
00:45:51,198 --> 00:45:52,768
it gave me butterflies.

1026
00:45:52,937 --> 00:45:54,067
- I loved that scene. - Right?

1027
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,408
- Enjoy your honeymoon. - Is it the same day?

1028
00:46:00,777 --> 00:46:02,047
Take this,

1029
00:46:02,348 --> 00:46:05,218
and buy Yoon Ah whatever she wants.

1030
00:46:05,748 --> 00:46:06,948
I will.

1031
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:09,147
- Thank you. - Go on in.

1032
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:10,718
It's not the same day.

1033
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:11,718
Have a safe trip.

1034
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:14,487
- Our hair looks different. - We'll see you when we get back.

1035
00:46:15,388 --> 00:46:17,058
Shall we get going, Yoon Ah?

1036
00:46:17,757 --> 00:46:18,857
I mean, honey?

1037
00:46:20,228 --> 00:46:21,297
Pardon?

1038
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:24,737
Yes, let's go, honey.

1039
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:29,007
It was very late.

1040
00:46:29,468 --> 00:46:30,978
Didn't you feel excited on your way to the airport?

1041
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:32,978
- It was nice. - On your way...

1042
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:34,678
- Just by being at the airport... - He wanted to go somewhere.

1043
00:46:34,678 --> 00:46:36,377
We asked him where he wanted to go.

1044
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:37,618
Goodbye.

1045
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:49,288
- Dong Gu. - Everyone else has left.

1046
00:46:49,527 --> 00:46:51,757
Our show was airing when we were shooting that.

1047
00:46:51,897 --> 00:46:54,498
- Right. - We had it on in the back.

1048
00:46:55,098 --> 00:46:56,268
We watched whenever we could.

1049
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,468
Dong Gu?

1050
00:46:59,498 --> 00:47:00,768
- Look at his face. - Dong Gu.

1051
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:02,607
- What? - I should have kicked his shin.

1052
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:05,007
What are you thinking about for so long?

1053
00:47:05,007 --> 00:47:06,138
That'd be more Welcome to Waikiki.

1054
00:47:06,678 --> 00:47:07,848
I wasn't thinking about anything.

1055
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:14,018
Anyway, how long do we have to stay here like this?

1056
00:47:15,948 --> 00:47:17,888
The guys said they'd let us know when the owner leaves the airport.

1057
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:19,857
Let's wait a bit longer and then leave.

1058
00:47:21,587 --> 00:47:23,087
Mr. Kang.

1059
00:47:24,127 --> 00:47:25,198
That's so random.

1060
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:27,328
- Mr. Kim. What brings you here? - They have to go to Jeju Island.

1061
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:30,737
You two must be going on your honeymoon.

1062
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:32,297
Pardon? Yes, that's right.

1063
00:47:32,297 --> 00:47:34,468
That's right. You said you're going to Jeju Island, right?

1064
00:47:34,908 --> 00:47:36,868
I'm just on my way to Jeju Island myself on a business trip.

1065
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:38,178
What time is your flight?

1066
00:47:38,877 --> 00:47:42,107
We're taking the 6:30pm flight.

1067
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:44,218
I'm taking the 6:30pm flight also.

1068
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:46,417
It's the same flight.

1069
00:47:46,618 --> 00:47:48,248
Our seats are even next to each other.

1070
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:49,518
This is amazing.

1071
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,388
It's time. Let's go.

1072
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:52,817
That's impossible.

1073
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:55,957
- Dong Gu. What should we do? - I don't know.

1074
00:47:56,058 --> 00:47:57,457
This is driving me crazy.

1075
00:47:57,658 --> 00:47:58,797
Hurry. Let's go.

1076
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,667
- I want to go somewhere. - So do I.

1077
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,368
- It's something personal, but... - I want to go somewhere.

1078
00:48:05,368 --> 00:48:06,468
I want to go to Jeju Island.

1079
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:09,768
I was so happy to wear clothes in a different style.

1080
00:48:10,978 --> 00:48:12,837
- The leather jacket. - Right.

1081
00:48:13,138 --> 00:48:14,507
Yoon Ah doesn't have many clothes.

1082
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:18,377
What is this? What's this squishy and disturbing feeling?

1083
00:48:18,748 --> 00:48:20,147
It's what we saw earlier.

1084
00:48:20,448 --> 00:48:21,647
My goodness.

1085
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:25,288
Why on earth did a dog have to poop here?

1086
00:48:26,058 --> 00:48:28,757
The poop made with choco pie looked very real.

1087
00:48:28,757 --> 00:48:29,928
With choco pie.

1088
00:48:30,558 --> 00:48:32,158
Didn't you pull pranks with it as a kid?

1089
00:48:32,158 --> 00:48:33,297
- I did. - Right.

1090
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:36,127
- Shouldn't we go meet them? - There's no need.

1091
00:48:36,127 --> 00:48:38,598
It wasn't even a real honeymoon. Why should we go see them arrive?

1092
00:48:38,937 --> 00:48:41,908
Why did they have to meet Attorney Kim right then?

1093
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:43,067
I know.

1094
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,837
What if Dong Gu and Yoon Ah really grow fond of each other?

1095
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:47,948
I doubt that.

1096
00:48:48,348 --> 00:48:50,917
Anyway, it's a relief the owner didn't find out.

1097
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,678
- Speaking of the owner, - Here she comes.

1098
00:48:52,678 --> 00:48:56,388
how could she believe that Dong Gu and Yoon Ah were a couple?

1099
00:48:58,957 --> 00:49:00,388
- They should have been careful. - What is that supposed to mean?

1100
00:49:01,257 --> 00:49:04,558
- Ma'am. - They're not a couple?

1101
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:10,027
You don't mean to say you lied to me, do you?

1102
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:11,437
You see, let me explain.

1103
00:49:11,437 --> 00:49:13,237
Tell me the truth this instant!

1104
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:16,368
Ma'am, please calm down.

1105
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:18,437
(Memorandum of Payment)

1106
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,707
Please forgive us. We didn't mean for this to happen.

1107
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:23,207
Shut your mouth,

1108
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:24,678
and just sign with your thumbprint.

1109
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:27,277
- Where is that place? - C-JeS Entertainment...

1110
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:28,718
What is this?

1111
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:30,987
If you fail to repay the expenses within a month,

1112
00:49:30,987 --> 00:49:32,987
it states that something horrible...

1113
00:49:32,987 --> 00:49:36,527
could happen to you. Consider it as a kind warning.

1114
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:39,158
What would you mean by something horrible?

1115
00:49:39,158 --> 00:49:40,658
Calculate the expenses times a hundred.

1116
00:49:41,198 --> 00:49:44,268
It would be your worst nightmare.

1117
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:48,968
I would put you all in jail if I could,

1118
00:49:52,437 --> 00:49:55,308
but I'm being generous for the baby's sake.

1119
00:49:55,777 --> 00:49:57,678
Sign with your thumbprint this instant.

1120
00:49:58,147 --> 00:50:00,678
How could we possibly arrange this large amount...

1121
00:50:00,678 --> 00:50:03,618
- of money within just one month? - Then would you prefer...

1122
00:50:03,987 --> 00:50:05,087
going to jail?

1123
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:08,158
Should I sign here?

1124
00:50:10,027 --> 00:50:12,058
(Recognizer: Kang Dong Gu)

1125
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:13,857
In the end, Du Shik pays her the money, right?

1126
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:15,297
- That's right. - He did.

1127
00:50:15,297 --> 00:50:16,567
Du Shik paid it.

1128
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:19,038
And you got into all the trouble.

1129
00:50:22,038 --> 00:50:23,237
Du Shik saved me.

1130
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:24,937
What do we do now?

1131
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:28,408
We don't have guests, and now, we're in debt.

1132
00:50:29,078 --> 00:50:31,178
If you think about it, it's thanks to Mal Geum.

1133
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:32,547
- That's right. - That's right.

1134
00:50:32,547 --> 00:50:34,518
This is all that jerk, Jun Ki's fault.

1135
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:36,547
Here comes Sweet Kang.

1136
00:50:37,018 --> 00:50:38,718
- So sweet. - So sweet.

1137
00:50:39,218 --> 00:50:42,558
The man on the motorcycle did an amazing job.

1138
00:50:47,828 --> 00:50:48,998
This is giving me butterflies.

1139
00:50:49,728 --> 00:50:51,268
- I love it. - Look at them.

1140
00:50:52,038 --> 00:50:53,667
I'll call him.

1141
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:58,507
- My heart flutters. - During the shoot when...

1142
00:50:58,507 --> 00:51:00,707
he turned me, I lost my balance.

1143
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:02,147
He nagged me.

1144
00:51:02,147 --> 00:51:03,908
He told me to stand straight because I'm heavy.

1145
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:07,047
- Did I say that? - He was so cold.

1146
00:51:08,218 --> 00:51:10,448
That's cold. It's like between calm and passion.

1147
00:51:10,757 --> 00:51:12,158
That's true.

1148
00:51:12,158 --> 00:51:14,987
Later in the scene, the lights are heart-shaped due to a filter.

1149
00:51:14,987 --> 00:51:16,658
- Right. - People recognized them.

1150
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:18,598
- Do you mean the lights? - Yes.

1151
00:51:18,598 --> 00:51:20,257
We have stars too.

1152
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:22,627
- Do you mean the lights? - Like those behind him.

1153
00:51:24,737 --> 00:51:27,468
What... What did you say?

1154
00:51:27,468 --> 00:51:30,167
It was amazing how the lights turned heart-shaped.

1155
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:31,777
- Right. - I wanted to thank you.

1156
00:51:31,777 --> 00:51:33,408
They simply put the filters on.

1157
00:51:33,408 --> 00:51:36,948
You should watch where you're going.

1158
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,678
You're so handful.

1159
00:51:41,647 --> 00:51:43,047
- Let's go. - He sees her as a woman.

1160
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:46,118
People recognized it too.

1161
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:48,587
- Right. - That she's a woman.

1162
00:51:49,457 --> 00:51:50,828
From a married woman to a woman.

1163
00:51:52,257 --> 00:51:53,998
- Back to the start. - Matilda.

1164
00:51:55,868 --> 00:51:59,437
That scene broke the flow.

1165
00:51:59,437 --> 00:52:00,598
That Matilda.

1166
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,167
Soo Ah.

1167
00:52:05,507 --> 00:52:08,348
- Soo Ah joins the family. - Right.

1168
00:52:13,018 --> 00:52:14,917
What are you doing here?

1169
00:52:15,317 --> 00:52:16,518
Did something happen?

1170
00:52:18,288 --> 00:52:19,558
Dong Gu.

1171
00:52:22,127 --> 00:52:24,598
What do I do, Dong Gu?

1172
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:32,098
I want to see her catch the crook soon.

1173
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:42,047
I like this type of music for a scene like this.

1174
00:52:42,047 --> 00:52:43,047
Right.

1175
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:47,178
- It's the style of our show. - Right.

1176
00:52:53,658 --> 00:52:54,728
(Thank you.)

1177
00:52:54,728 --> 00:52:58,357
For the next five weeks, we'll show...

1178
00:52:58,357 --> 00:53:00,098
the sweetness and bitterness of youth.

1179
00:53:00,098 --> 00:53:01,998
We'll work hard to bring you...

1180
00:53:01,998 --> 00:53:03,968
a comedy that you can relate to.

1181
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:06,368
- Stay tuned. - Stay tuned.

1182
00:53:07,138 --> 00:53:08,567
Let's scream.

1183
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:11,337
Dong Gu, scream.

1184
00:53:12,138 --> 00:53:13,607
Let's scream, everyone.

1185
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,207
(Preview of episode 11 is coming up next.)

1186
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:18,448
Are you hired as a regular actor for a drama?

1187
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:19,948
Congratulations, Jun Ki.

1188
00:53:19,948 --> 00:53:21,348
What if he becomes a star?

1189
00:53:21,348 --> 00:53:22,647
I started a social network site.

1190
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,518
Take a photo with me like you're my fan.

1191
00:53:24,518 --> 00:53:25,687
No way.

1192
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:28,087
- Take a look inside my ear. - What are you doing?

1193
00:53:28,428 --> 00:53:29,587
Why is she so mean to me?

1194
00:53:29,587 --> 00:53:30,998
Calm down, heart.

1195
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:32,957
- What are you looking at? - I'm looking for...

1196
00:53:32,957 --> 00:53:34,797
a job that will make me happy forever.

1197
00:53:35,098 --> 00:53:37,638
I stopped studying when I was young.

1198
00:53:37,638 --> 00:53:39,198
You can start studying again.

1199
00:53:39,198 --> 00:53:41,507
Thank you. Your positive comments encourage me.

1200
00:53:41,507 --> 00:53:43,038
Do you have that ramyeon today?

1201
00:53:44,837 --> 00:53:46,437
You, stop right there.

1202
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:47,808
Du Shik, stop him.

1203
00:53:49,408 --> 00:53:51,518
Dong Gu, do you like Yoon Ah?

1204
00:53:51,518 --> 00:53:53,078
What's wrong with your face?

1205
00:53:53,078 --> 00:53:54,218
Did you not sleep?

1206
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:56,518
I was worried as there was a sudden problem in the dormitory.

1207
00:53:56,518 --> 00:53:57,888
You saved me.

1208
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:00,087
Hyung Joon.

1209
00:54:00,087 --> 00:54:03,457
Are those two alone in the house so late?

1210
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:05,127
Why isn't she picking up?

1211
00:54:05,127 --> 00:54:07,567
Who is it? Dong Gu.

1212
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:20,748
("Pretty Sister Who Buys Me Food")

1213
00:54:20,948 --> 00:54:24,817
By the way, if...

1214
00:54:25,547 --> 00:54:26,748
If?

1215
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:30,147
- If I... - If you what?

1216
00:54:31,218 --> 00:54:34,857
Would you buy me food if I asked you?
