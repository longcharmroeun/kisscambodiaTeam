3
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:17,248
Today, you made feel a tiny bit

4
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:19,365
touched by what you did.

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,748
Touched? No need for that.

6
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:26,978
Like you said,
it was a very important interview.

7
00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:31,129
So, you should pass and get the job.

8
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:32,567
All right, girl?

9
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:37,877
You know when I saw you earlier?

10
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:41,112
My heart was racing, you know.

11
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:43,344
Why do you think it did that?

12
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,140
Am I crazy?

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,252
Hey, just let me look at you.

14
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:49,841
Hey, what are you doing?

15
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,884
Let me look at you.

16
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:59,953
I don't understand it.

17
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:03,740
What is attractive about this guy?

18
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,135
You scared me.

19
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:32,709
Kang Dong Gu, what are you doing here?

20
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:35,262
I can't fall asleep.

21
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,308
What's with the expression
on your face?

22
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:46,441
Su Ah, you asked me if I could
handle being with Yoon Ah.

23
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:49,376
No matter how much I think about it,
I can't find the answer.

24
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,310
I don't know if I can handle it.

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,814
I suppose it's not easy to know.

26
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:58,685
Do you want to have soju with me?

27
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,234
My life isn't so great,
so I was going to have a drink.

28
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:02,602
Should I?

29
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:04,576
Okay.

30
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:06,466
Let's go.

31
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:16,223
Shoes, shoes, shoes.

32
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:18,433
Gosh, this isn't it.

33
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:21,550
Hey, hold on.

34
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,616
Ouch! Oh my gosh.

35
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:29,181
Hey, I told you to wait.

36
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:30,882
It's not that way.

37
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:34,103
No, I'm going to drink more.

38
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:38,021
It's not that way. It's this way.

39
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:39,656
I'm going to drink more.

40
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:42,070
I'm going to drink more!

41
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:47,587
Ow! It hurts, it hurts.

42
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:48,895
Are you okay?

43
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:51,195
What is this thing?

44
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:55,096
Huh... huh?

45
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:59,252
This is Dong Gu's camera.

46
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:03,002
Seo Jin, what do we do?

47
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:06,204
I broke Dong Gu's camera.

48
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:08,771
What do we do?

49
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,448
Oh no. Hey, stop.

50
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:14,093
No, stop. Stop. stop.

51
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,475
<i>[My Love, Olivia]</i>

52
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:23,282
Ah... I think I'm going to die.

53
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:28,822
Ah... my stomach.

54
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,674
Why did you two drink so much?

55
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:32,358
I don't know. Don't talk to me.

56
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,667
Hm, Min Su Ah.

57
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,947
You drink too much.

58
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:39,388
Hello. Yes, Detective.

59
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,658
Did you catch that con artist?

60
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,310
Not yet?

61
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,532
Yes, I understand.

62
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,657
This detective is
always telling me to wait.

63
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:53,872
They haven't caught
that Yoon Seok guy yet?

64
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:55,622
No, they haven't.

65
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:58,871
Where is that guy hiding anyway?

66
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,582
Wait until he gets caught.
I'll get my hands on him and...

67
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:03,842
Don't worry.
I'm sure they'll catch him soon.

68
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:06,043
Doo Shik, are you okay?

69
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:08,217
I mean, about Mal Geum.

70
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:14,784
I'm okay. It's a good
opportunity for Mal Geum.

71
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,939
She left for a good reason.

72
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:22,382
Also, I'm extending my web novel,
so I have no time to think about her.

73
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:25,149
Web novel? I thought that ended.

74
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:30,598
But the fans are asking for season two
of "President is Bruce Lee."

75
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:32,209
Season two?

76
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:35,269
Of that story about
the president fighting aliens?

77
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,278
I was going to rest for a bit.

78
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:41,440
However, a writer cannot
ignore the requests of his fans.

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,908
I'll be going to my part-time job, then.

80
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:48,406
Season two.

81
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,473
I made pollack soup
because you all drank yesterday.

82
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,903
Really?

83
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:06,987
Oh, this is so good.

84
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:08,704
Dong Gu, you should try it too.

85
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:10,956
Yes, thank you for the food.

86
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:19,127
Are Seo Jin and Joon Ki still sleeping?

87
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:21,065
It seemed like they
drank a lot yesterday.

88
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:24,846
They're always fighting,
so why are they always together?

89
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,103
They're going to end up
liking each other at that rate.

90
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:28,656
Liking each other? What?

91
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:31,216
Why would you say such an awful thing?

92
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,336
How dare you say that
about my precious sister?

93
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:36,514
Why would stick her with that guy?

94
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:38,610
- What's wrong with Joon Ki?
- What?

95
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,757
I'm not saying Joon Ki is a bad person.

96
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:45,495
I just know his entire life history,
so how dare he go near my sister?

97
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,831
Hey, Min Su Ah.

98
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:49,887
Don't ever say such a terrifying thing.

99
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,331
Seriously, now.

100
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,240
Oh, my head hurts.

101
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,050
What happened?
Why did you two drink together?

102
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,259
Where and until what time?

103
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,490
I don't know. I don't know.

104
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,081
Seo Jin, what time
did we get in yesterday?

105
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:05,689
I blacked out and I don't remember.

106
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:09,685
Me too. I only remember some parts.

107
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,980
- What?
- Yeah, so let's see.

108
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,930
So, we started with soju around 7:00 pm.

109
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,197
Then we ordered beer.

110
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:17,940
Then we mixed the two.

111
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,831
Then we had fish cake soup and rice wine.

112
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:25,021
We were about to leave,
but the owner gave us free tofu kimchi.

113
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,533
We ordered soju again.

114
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,403
We had a few more drinks
of soju and then...

115
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:38,250
What? What did we yesterday...

116
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,439
Hang on.

117
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,887
I'm going to drink more!

118
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,213
What? What is it?

119
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:51,774
Did something happen between you two?

120
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:53,824
No, nothing happened.

121
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:56,803
No... no. What would happen?

122
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:58,973
I'd better go take a shower.

123
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:01,375
I think I need some sleep.

124
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:25,545
Darn it. It wasn't a dream.

125
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,372
It was real.

126
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:32,091
Dong Gu's going to go crazy
once he finds out. What do I do?

127
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:44,317
I must be crazy. I'm crazy.

128
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,048
Why did I do it?

129
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,208
Why?

130
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,346
What was I thinking kissing that guy?

131
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:51,069
Why?

132
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,869
- Seo Jin.
- Oh my goodness.

133
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:58,793
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

134
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:02,233
Oh, then... you too, Joon Ki?

135
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,266
Of course, I remember it.

136
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:06,906
How could something like this happen?

137
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:08,244
What do we do now?

138
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:12,396
Joon Ki, let's just pretend
that it never happened.

139
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:13,634
Never happened?

140
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:15,576
How can we do that?
It's already happened.

141
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:18,295
Why not? We can just
pretend it never happened.

142
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,538
What if Dong Gu finds out?

143
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,901
What? Dong Gu?

144
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,045
How would Dong Gu find out?
It's not like he saw.

145
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:27,661
Hey, nothing will remain
a secret forever in this world.

146
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,036
What do you mean?
There were no witnesses.

147
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:32,807
If we keep it a secret,
no one will know.

148
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:34,740
You think so?

149
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,522
Yes, so...

150
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:43,038
Joon Ki, let's take
this secret to the grave.

151
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,964
All right, then.

152
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:49,351
Ah, I don't feel right about this.

153
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,687
I must be insane.

154
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:53,567
Why did I kiss that guy?

155
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,046
My lips are my enemy.

156
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:06,163
Seriously, why did I have to
break Dong Gu's camera?

157
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:08,668
Alcohol is my enemy.

158
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:10,937
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.

159
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,912
What can I do when the president
died fighting aliens in season one?

160
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:21,184
Should I bring him back to life?

161
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,571
Zombie! Yes.

162
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:26,825
He can become a zombie
and face off against the aliens.

163
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:32,332
"President is Bruce Lee... Is Zombie."

164
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:36,589
Wow, that is a great title.

165
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,461
Excuse me, do you have that ramen here?

166
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,062
Which one?

167
00:09:42,522 --> 00:09:45,157
- That one.
- Ba bai bbo... what?

168
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,407
Oh, you mean that Thai ramen?
We're all out.

169
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:52,741
Is that right? I really wanted to eat it.

170
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:56,196
<i>Su Ah already has a new boyfriend?</i>

171
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,279
What does he do?

172
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,488
He's the owner of a Thai restaurant.

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,153
Wait.

174
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:05,619
Ba bai bbo bai...

175
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:09,136
Thai...

176
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,241
I'm positive that was
Su Ah's ex-boyfriend.

177
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,807
He's dead!

178
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,947
I think something just passed by.

179
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:30,663
I think so.

180
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,697
"He's dead"?

181
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,038
Dong Gu, sorry to ask,
but I have to go to my class.

182
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:36,645
Could you watch Sol for me?

183
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:37,907
Yes, sure.

184
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:39,052
Thank you.

185
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:42,873
Come here, Sol.
Mommy needs to go to class.

186
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:45,211
Thank you, Dong Gu.
I'll be back.

187
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,456
Yes. Get there safely.

188
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,211
I'd better check our bookings then.

189
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:57,778
Gosh, who made such a mess here?

190
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,750
Huh?

191
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:04,293
What? Why is this on the ground?

192
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:08,527
What is this doing here?

193
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,268
Why is this like this?

194
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,466
My camera! What's wrong with my camera?

195
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,820
What's wrong with this? Hey!

196
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,174
- It was you, wasn't it? It was you!
- Huh?

197
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:19,979
- No.
- Oh, I feel better.

198
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,658
Hey, Kang Seo Jin!
You did this, didn't you?

199
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:24,110
You did this, right?

200
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,280
What are you talking about?
I didn't even look at your camera.

201
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:32,763
What? Then, was it Doo Shik?

202
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:36,148
Hello. Bong Doo Shik!

203
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:39,100
You broke my camera, didn't you?

204
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,477
No? Then hang up!

205
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:45,274
Who did this to my camera?

206
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:49,573
Just wait until I find out who,
I'll break them in half.

207
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:55,352
My camera! Oh, my camera...

208
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:58,125
Who did this? Who?

209
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:01,385
This can't be.

210
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:03,815
How...

211
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:08,219
Why did I kiss Joon Ki anyway?

212
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:10,005
Am I crazy? Okay, yes.

213
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,503
He was kind of cool at the interview.

214
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:16,293
Still, why did I do it? Why?

215
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,865
I don't know.

216
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:21,240
- Seo Jin.
- Ah! You startled me.

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,070
- Knock, would you?
- Sorry.

218
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,563
I wanted to talk.

219
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:28,677
Talk? About what?

220
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,413
Seo Jin, about yesterday...

221
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,480
- Let's just tell Dong Gu about it.
- What?

222
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,681
I don't understand why
you want to tell my brother.

223
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,341
Didn't you see Dong Gu?

224
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:46,461
I think Dong Gu will be
really angry if he finds out later.

225
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,876
I feel so nervous right now.

226
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:50,746
So, how would my brother find out?

227
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:53,937
Seo Jin, nothing remains
a secret forever.

228
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:58,225
If we hide it and he finds out later,
we could really die.

229
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:00,134
Don't you know Dong Gu's personality?

230
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:03,381
Let's just turn ourselves in.

231
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,782
Okay, suppose we turn ourselves in.

232
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:09,791
Do you think Dong Gu will understand
and tell us we did a good job?

233
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:13,833
You and I will be
facing death in that moment.

234
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:17,849
How could I do such a thing?

235
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,788
Just erase it from your mind.

236
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:24,339
If the two of us stay quiet,
no one will ever know.

237
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,224
I understand for now.

238
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:37,644
Why does he want to tell my brother
that we kissed?

239
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,436
Is he crazy?

240
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:43,328
Will we really not get caught
if we stay quiet?

241
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,799
She really is quite scary.

242
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,575
How could she stay quiet after
breaking her brother's cherished camera?

243
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:54,447
I'm scared of girls like that.

244
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,285
Detective, you can catch him now that
he's been caught on CCTV, right?

245
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,812
You want me to wait again?

246
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:07,240
How long do you expect me to wait?

247
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,590
Hello? Mister... Mister?

248
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:15,221
Why do the police always tell me to wait?

249
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:17,221
This won't do.

250
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:20,529
What are you doing?

251
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:24,033
I'm going to stand guard myself.

252
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:25,602
What? I can't?

253
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:27,342
That's not it.

254
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:30,388
Won't he run off
if you're standing there like this?

255
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:31,639
Maybe.

256
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:34,373
What should I do?

257
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,033
This is so tacky. Look at the design.

258
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,451
What's with the uniform?

259
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:41,951
That's what all part-time worker
uniforms are like.

260
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,791
How long are you staying here?

261
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,210
Until I catch him.

262
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,511
Why? I can't?

263
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,614
No. Then, I'll go stock the products.

264
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:52,985
- Watch the counter.
- Okay.

265
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:02,297
Welcome.

266
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:05,989
Get me a cola and bring me
a chocolate on the way too.

267
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,879
What? Why are you
telling me to do that?

268
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,508
Just do it if the customer asks for it.
Why are you arguing?

269
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,336
What did you say?

270
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:16,405
Why are you speaking to me informally
when I've never met you?

271
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:17,768
What? You don't like it?

272
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:20,167
You're a part-timer.
Show some manners to your customer.

273
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,673
What did you say?

274
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:23,144
Are you serious, Mister?

275
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:25,658
Hey, hey. Just stay put.

276
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,168
Sorry, I'll bring it right out.

277
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,274
You should've done that to begin with.

278
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:41,782
- Here you go, sir.
- Okay.

279
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:48,342
Here you go.

280
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:57,365
Excuse me. Why are you
throwing that on the floor?

281
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,001
The garbage can is over there.

282
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,989
Your job includes cleaning these things.

283
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:04,128
Don't you know that?

284
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:05,628
What did you say?

285
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:07,671
What's with you, Mister?

286
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,499
What's wrong with you?

287
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:12,278
Sorry, this is her first day.

288
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:13,821
Gosh.

289
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:17,474
I'll let it go for your sake today.
Do your job properly.

290
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:18,806
That guy...

291
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:21,460
Thank you. Goodbye.

292
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,750
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

293
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,948
What did I do? He was in the wrong.

294
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,559
He's always been like that.
Her owns the meat restaurant.

295
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,690
It's better to avoid him.

296
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:36,681
You fool. Gosh.

297
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,379
Yoon Ah.

298
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:48,725
Oh, hello.

299
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,677
Wait.

300
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:53,227
Why do you sound so down?

301
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:54,798
Is something wrong?

302
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:58,397
It's just that
everyone else is doing well.

303
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,780
I feel like I'm the only one
who's not following along.

304
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,801
Don't worry too much.

305
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:04,711
You can catch up quickly if you practice.

306
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:08,317
The only place I can practice
is the kitchen at the academy.

307
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:11,363
Yoon Ah, do you have some time today?

308
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:15,352
- Come on in.
- Yes.

309
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:19,897
Why are we at a bakery?

310
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:22,215
Hello, President Song.

311
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,727
This is your bakery, Hyun Joon?

312
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:27,675
Yes. Come on in, Yoon Ah.

313
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:29,566
Okay.

314
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:42,611
Wow, what is this place?

315
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,340
It's my personal work place.

316
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,281
I come up with recipes here
and secretly take naps here.

317
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,074
I see.

318
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:55,609
Yoon Ah, do you want to try making
the doughnut from the academy again?

319
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:56,700
I'll help you.

320
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,159
Really?

321
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,971
Why is a camera so expensive?

322
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:05,907
I can barely make a living.
This is driving me insane.

323
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
Dong Gu.

324
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,355
Did you go somewhere?

325
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:16,726
A camera repair shop.

326
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:19,821
They say it's too destroyed to fix.

327
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:24,750
Ah, my poor Olivia.

328
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,330
Olivia?

329
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:29,232
Who is Olivia?

330
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:30,791
Her name.

331
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:35,419
I cared more about her
than my own little sister.

332
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:39,438
I worked in construction for a year
in order to buy this.

333
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,901
I cleaned her every day
and took care of her.

334
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,733
I grew so fond of her.

335
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,512
Dong Gu... are you crying?

336
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:57,076
It's nothing.

337
00:18:57,076 --> 00:19:01,463
It feels a bit like I'm sending off my
little sister and my heart feels empty.

338
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:06,351
Olivia.

339
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:09,250
Olivia...

340
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:17,021
Why aren't they getting back to me
with my interview results?

341
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,826
Sol, do you think I failed again?

342
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:24,942
That can't happen, right?

343
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,105
Seo Jin, Seo Jin.

344
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:31,174
You scared me. What now?

345
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:34,413
I really think we should
tell Dong Gu the truth.

346
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:35,797
What are you talking about?

347
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:39,330
Hey, Dong Gu's crying right now.
He's crying.

348
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,288
What? Why is he crying?

349
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:44,249
What does his crying
have to do with us?

350
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,667
Kang Seo Jin,
do you have a conscience or not?

351
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,580
What are you talking about?
What does conscience have to do with it?

352
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,769
Hey, doesn't this bother your conscience?

353
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:54,355
You're not sorry toward Dong Gu?

354
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:57,057
Why would it be something we need
to be sorry to my brother about?

355
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,645
Hey, what kind of person are you?

356
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,606
I can't even look Dong Gu in the eyes.

357
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:06,407
Joon Ki, it was just an accident
that occurred while we were drunk.

358
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,338
It shouldn't bother your conscience.

359
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:11,086
Hey, you're really something.

360
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,907
Aren't you ashamed to look at Sol?

361
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:17,317
I never imagined
you'd be so shameless like this.

362
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,156
What do you mean shameless?

363
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:23,425
Joon Ki, you seem
very confused right now.

364
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:24,997
Go get some sleep.

365
00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:28,866
You'll be fine after you get
some good sleep, okay?

366
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,180
Go sleep.

367
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,924
It'll be okay, right?

368
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:41,628
Why are you laughing?

369
00:20:41,628 --> 00:20:44,421
I'm laughing because it's so absurd.

370
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:47,612
It's not enough that the president is
a zombie, but he shoots wind forces, too?

371
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,516
Does that make sense?

372
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,366
It's explained in detail in season one

373
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,217
that he is the reincarnation
of Bruce Lee.

374
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:54,796
Does that make sense?

375
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,839
Even I could write that.

376
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,856
Hey!

377
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:02,496
How long are you staying here?

378
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,758
Until I catch him.

379
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:07,509
I'm going to be off work soon.

380
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,397
So, get changed soon.

381
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:11,922
<i>[Piggy President of Meat Restaurant]</i>

382
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,943
- Yes, sir.
- It's me.

383
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,450
Bring five bowls ramen
with hot water in them.

384
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,837
What?

385
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:23,096
That's a bit difficult.
I'm leaving work soon.

386
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,008
Then you can bring it on your way home.

387
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:27,111
- <i>Hurry up.</i>
- What?

388
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,266
President? President?

389
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:34,095
What? What now?

390
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:36,393
Am I his servant or what?

391
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,640
Here are your five bowls of ramen.

392
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,768
Hey, what took you so long?
You should've come earlier.

393
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:46,426
How much?

394
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:48,528
4,500 won.

395
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:03,520
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.

396
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,106
Let's go, Su Ah.

397
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,743
Doo Shik.

398
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,662
Let's have some meat while we're here.

399
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:12,976
I'll treat you.

400
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,394
Why do you suddenly want to eat?

401
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:15,476
Let's just go.

402
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,709
Hey, hey, hey.

403
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:24,452
Over here.

404
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,244
What is it?

405
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:29,171
You're going to eat? What would you like?

406
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:31,711
Bring two servings of pork belly
and one bottle of soda.

407
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:34,700
Also, cook the meat before serving it.
I don't want to bother grilling it.

408
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,558
- What did you say?
- What? You don't like it?

409
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:40,029
Just do it if the customer asks for it.
Why are you arguing?

410
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,336
Why is a young thing like you
speaking informally?

411
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:44,406
What? You don't like it?

412
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,416
Isn't a customer allowed
to speak that way?

413
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,548
What?

414
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,166
Hey, why are you
throwing that away there?

415
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,768
Cleaning costs are
included in the meat costs.

416
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:59,664
That's what you said yesterday.

417
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:01,875
Are you crazy, you wench?

418
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,941
What? Wench?

419
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:09,327
Did you call your
precious customer a "wench"?

420
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:13,641
Wow, this place treats
their customers like dog crap.

421
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:15,556
What are you doing?
What is it?

422
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,448
- What did you just do?
- What?

423
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:19,773
Did you... hit me?

424
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,915
A weak woman?

425
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:25,125
I didn't hit you.
I just lightly grabbed. What?

426
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,845
Oh! Oh!

427
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:32,288
Look at this. It's all loose.

428
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:34,816
I think my shoulder is broken.

429
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:37,096
- Really?
- Doo Shik, call the police.

430
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:39,098
- Police?
- It hurts so much.

431
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:41,690
Why are you doing this? Please stop.

432
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,090
Oh no. Hey, hey.

433
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,125
Oh no. Mommy!

434
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:58,551
What are you doing? Hurry up.

435
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,623
Ah, it hurts again. This won't do.

436
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:03,101
Doo Shik, call the police.

437
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:04,717
I'm sorry.

438
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:08,429
You're... sorry?

439
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:09,941
Sorry?

440
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,152
I apologize.

441
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:15,671
Say it to him too.

442
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:19,570
What are you doing? Hurry up.

443
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,453
I apologize.

444
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:24,606
I am very sorry for all those times.

445
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:26,025
Yes.

446
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,240
- Listen up, Mister.
- Yes.

447
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,289
He may be a little lacking.

448
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:35,704
His mother had seaweed soup
and had a party when he was born.

449
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:39,986
So, he's not there for you to
speak down to and look down on.

450
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:42,935
He's not a slave
that you can give work to.

451
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:48,144
If you abuse your power
and get caught by me again

452
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:52,089
I don't know what I'll do then, got it?

453
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:57,045
Yes. How is your shoulder,
by the way?

454
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:00,586
- Ow!
- Oh!

455
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:04,008
It's all better.

456
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:06,797
Give the treatment cost
as a bonus to your employees.

457
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,797
Doo Shik, let's go.

458
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:11,256
Okay.

459
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:15,328
What are you doing? Hurry up.

460
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:19,355
Yes. Goodbye.

461
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:21,451
Su Ah, that was awesome.

462
00:25:21,451 --> 00:25:23,048
You were really cool.

463
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:26,048
Thanks to you,
I feel such a sense of relief.

464
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:29,948
So, if you ever see someone abusing
their power to bother a weak person

465
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:31,439
don't ever let it go.

466
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:34,395
If you let it go,
they think they can keep doing it.

467
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:36,160
You'll become a real fool then.

468
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,795
Okay, got it.

469
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:41,866
Gosh, why is my bag so heavy?

470
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:45,184
Hey, carry my bag.

471
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:46,741
- Huh?
- What are you doing?

472
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:48,336
Carry my bag.

473
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:49,630
Hurry up. It's heavy.

474
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,549
Ow! It hurts, it hurts.

475
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:56,827
Oh, I'm hungry
after putting on that show.

476
00:25:56,827 --> 00:25:59,396
Hey, buy me some spicy rice cakes.

477
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,509
- Huh?
- What are you doing? I'm hungry.

478
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:04,557
Ah, I'm so hungry.

479
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:10,032
Oh, okay.
Spicy rice cakes... spicy rice cakes.

480
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:11,417
Wait.

481
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:15,178
Su Ah, isn't this an abuse of power too?

482
00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:16,275
Hm?

483
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,936
There's no such thing between friends.

484
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:21,030
I'm asking for a favor.

485
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,919
What are you doing? Go buy some.

486
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,557
Hurry, hurry. Okay?

487
00:26:25,557 --> 00:26:27,549
Get moving.

488
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:28,824
Move.

489
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:30,480
Yeah, okay.

490
00:26:40,146 --> 00:26:41,596
Hm...

491
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,000
It tastes...

492
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:49,103
good.

493
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:51,647
- Really?
- Yes, it's very good.

494
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:55,882
I told you. You just need to practice.

495
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:59,144
Thank you.
It's all thanks to you, Hyun Joon.

496
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:03,063
Yoon Ah, why did you want
to become a patisseur?

497
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:07,339
This is kind of embarrassing to say.

498
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:10,951
I'm a little clumsy
and I always make mistakes.

499
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:15,288
But when I baked bread,
I was told it was good.

500
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:20,106
I felt that this might be
the one thing I could be good at.

501
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,826
Oh.

502
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:24,307
I'm going to work harder and succeed.

503
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:26,906
I'll open a big bakery like yours.

504
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:32,305
And I'll give Sol the chance
to do everything she wants.

505
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:34,534
I see.

506
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:38,682
Yoon Ah, then you can come here
and practice when you have time.

507
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:41,756
- I'll let my employees know.
- Really?

508
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:45,688
Thank you. Thank you so much.

509
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:58,637
What is this sound?

510
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:07,416
Don't come near me!

511
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:12,284
It's me, Olivia.

512
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,192
Olivia?

513
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:16,383
Who is Olivia?

514
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:18,904
Dong Gu's camera?

515
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,711
My owner cared for me so much.

516
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:26,250
You ruined everything.

517
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,403
This is all your fault.
It's all your fault.

518
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:31,925
I'm sorry.

519
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:33,830
I didn't do it on purpose.

520
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,922
Shut up!

521
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,352
How long do you think
you can hide the truth?

522
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:41,527
I want to tell the truth,
but Seo Jin--

523
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:45,184
Don't make excuses!
Ultimately, you didn't say anything.

524
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,153
I will never forgive you.

525
00:28:47,153 --> 00:28:50,080
I won't ever forgive you!

526
00:28:52,724 --> 00:28:55,035
Blood, blood, blood!

527
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,839
No, this isn't right.

528
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:07,096
This isn't right!

529
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,894
Seo Jin, wake up. Seo Jin, get up!

530
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:13,834
What do you want now?

531
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:17,026
Olivia... Olivia showed up.

532
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,566
Who is Olivia?

533
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:20,692
She had bloody tears... Dong Gu.

534
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,972
What are you talking about right now?

535
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,851
I can't live like this.

536
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,539
I think we need to
tell Dong Gu the truth.

537
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:33,651
Joon Ki, wait.
Why are you being like this?

538
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:36,507
Why do you insist on telling my brother?

539
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:38,073
That's the only way I can live.

540
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:41,288
Olivia... Olivia!

541
00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:44,365
Joon Ki, Joon Ki!

542
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,422
Gosh, what's with him?

543
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,576
It must have hurt you so much.

544
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:53,635
Olivia, Olivia.

545
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:58,990
Dong Gu, I need to tell you something.

546
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,005
What is it?

547
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:04,268
To tell you the truth,
Seo Jin and I...

548
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:07,683
- What happened was--
- Wait, wait!

549
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:11,172
What's wrong with you, Joon Ki?
Are you insane?

550
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:14,200
Are you going to be this way?
How long are you going to lie?

551
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,519
How long are you going to
lie to your poor brother?

552
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,222
If you keep this up,
she will come looking for you.

553
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:25,702
- Olivia... that Olivia...
- What are you saying?

554
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:28,569
What are you talking about, huh?

555
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:29,859
What's this about?

556
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,632
Kang Seo Jin, you tell him.

557
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,701
This is the last chance for you
to come clean with your brother.

558
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,412
Seriously, this is crazy.

559
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:41,080
Why do we have to
tell my brother about that?

560
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,241
Are you going to be like this
until the very end?

561
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,359
Okay. Fine, I'll tell him.

562
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,830
This is so insane.

563
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,221
What are you two doing?

564
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:54,775
I just don't know
why I have to tell my brother.

565
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:56,384
Do it!

566
00:30:57,826 --> 00:31:00,368
Dong Gu, honestly...

567
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:01,394
Yeah.

568
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:03,586
Yesterday, we were drinking.

569
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:06,001
- We drank a bit.
- Yeah.

570
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:08,878
- Joon Ki and I...
- Yes?

571
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:12,238
What? Why are you
taking so long to tell me?

572
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,943
We kissed.

573
00:31:14,943 --> 00:31:17,782
Yeah, we kissed yesterday.
Wait, what did you say?

574
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:19,955
What are you saying?

575
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:21,695
I did what with you?

576
00:31:21,695 --> 00:31:23,528
What? You weren't referring to the kiss?

577
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:25,487
What are you even talking about?

578
00:31:25,487 --> 00:31:28,059
I was talking about how we broke
Dong Gu's camera yesterday.

579
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:29,200
What?

580
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:35,261
Hold on, hold on.

581
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,329
So, let me get this straight.

582
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,278
You two went drinking yesterday.

583
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:43,480
And you broke my camera.

584
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,958
No, no, no! No.

585
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,598
Before that...

586
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:51,917
you two were drinking.

587
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:54,943
And you ended up kissing. Kiss!

588
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:57,277
The two of you? Is that true?

589
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:02,586
Dong Gu, it was just a mistake.

590
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:03,763
A mistake.

591
00:32:03,763 --> 00:32:04,903
A mistake?

592
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:07,103
Hey, Dong Gu.

593
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:09,760
Why don't you just
calm down a little bit?

594
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,623
Calm? How can I be calm right now?

595
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:15,130
Get over here.

596
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:22,801
Get out!

597
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:24,155
<i>Why are you locking the door?</i>

598
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:26,323
What are you two doing in the room?

599
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:27,678
<i>Open the door. I'll break it!</i>

600
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:29,067
I'll break it down!

601
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:30,363
<i>Open it now!</i>

602
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:32,903
Dong Gu, please calm down.

603
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:34,470
Dong Gu, calm down.

604
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,211
Let's be rational about this.
Let's talk about this.

605
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:38,490
Open the door!

606
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:43,352
What's going on?
Why is it suddenly quiet?

607
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:44,621
Is he gone?

608
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,575
Gosh, I thought I was going to die.

609
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:53,378
Chewbacca, did we really ki...

610
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:56,105
Did we really do that?

611
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:58,027
Yeah, we did.

612
00:32:58,027 --> 00:32:59,845
Why would you tell Dong Gu that?

613
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,172
You said to tell him.

614
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:03,204
You said it was
my last chance to come clean.

615
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:06,474
I thought it was about the camera. Geez!

616
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:10,215
Wait, now.

617
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:12,270
- Look here, Kang Seo Jin.
- What?

618
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,184
You intentionally
got me drunk, didn't you?

619
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:18,642
What? Are you crazy?

620
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:19,718
Why would I ever do that?

621
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:22,432
You punks! Get over here now!

622
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:28,548
Get over here! Get over here!

623
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,912
- Dong Gu.
- Shut up!

624
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:43,144
You dare to kiss
my little sister, Joon Ki?

625
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,446
Oh, my head. Ow.

626
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:51,148
Dong Gu, it was really a drunken mistake.

627
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:53,983
I must have lost my mind
because I was so drunk.

628
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:57,666
Even though I don't have a boyfriend,
I wouldn't get involved with him.

629
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,326
What? Hey.

630
00:33:59,326 --> 00:34:02,000
I don't like girls with bad tempers
and more facial hair than me.

631
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,752
- You want to die?
- What?

632
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,365
Shut up!

633
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:08,960
You two have to stay, at least,
five meters away from each other.

634
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,512
Don't even look at each other.

635
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:14,123
Don't talk to each other or even
think about one another. Got that?

636
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:15,552
Yeah.

637
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Yeah.

638
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,032
Why aren't you moving apart
from each other?

639
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,820
Okay, go to your own rooms now.

640
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,130
- Okay.
- Get moving!

641
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,927
Go! Get away from each other!

642
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:33,498
I'm already in a bad mood.
Why did this have to happen?

643
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,012
Dong Gu, give the vacuum to me.

644
00:34:43,012 --> 00:34:44,722
It's okay. I'll do it.

645
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:46,034
Just give it to me.

646
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:48,003
No, I said I'll do it.

647
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,463
Don't worry about it and
do your own work, Yoon Ah.

648
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,414
- Okay.
- Yeah.

649
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:54,675
By the way, Dong Gu...

650
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,280
are you mad at me about something?

651
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,840
You don't talk to me lately.

652
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,206
What? When did I do that?
It's not like that.

653
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,987
That's good, then.

654
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:10,530
Then I'll go down and start dinner.

655
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,498
Okay, you do that.

656
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:33,362
What are you doing here?

657
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:34,581
Nothing.

658
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:37,070
What is that thing?

659
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,440
Ah, this thing?

660
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,030
It helps get rid of puffy eyes.
It's a necessity for models.

661
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:46,155
I've been staking out the
convenience store and my eyes are puffy.

662
00:35:46,155 --> 00:35:48,525
Ah, I see.

663
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,347
Hey, you're boring
a hole into the ground.

664
00:35:57,237 --> 00:35:58,387
What's wrong?

665
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:01,451
Is it about Yoon Ah again?

666
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:05,934
Well... I told myself
to stop over and over.

667
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:08,059
But, I can't stop.

668
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:10,206
Su Ah.

669
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:14,065
I like Yoon Ah more and more.
What am I supposed to do?

670
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:17,601
What do you like so much about Yoon Ah?

671
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:20,518
I don't really know.

672
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:25,300
I don't know what I like about her
or why I like her.

673
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:38,135
<i>[A Not So Flashy Confession]</i>

674
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:41,168
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

675
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:43,076
I just can't find the answer.

676
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,956
I'm just a part-timer filming
birthday parties for babies.

677
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:48,603
How can I ever take care of anyone?

678
00:36:54,998 --> 00:36:58,193
Can I ever make it as a director?

679
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:03,920
Will it just end as a dream?

680
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,987
Dong Gu.

681
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,521
How long has it been?

682
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:11,192
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, Director.

683
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:13,052
- Hello.
- What have you been doing?

684
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:14,775
This and that.

685
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:17,246
- What about you?
- I'm starting a movie soon.

686
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:18,757
Congratulations.

687
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:20,875
I'm hiring a crew right now.

688
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:23,282
Are you interested in
working on the directing team?

689
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,579
Me?

690
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:30,278
I'll think about it.

691
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:32,038
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.

692
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:41,773
Ah, it's a loss again.

693
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,204
What if we end up
on the streets at this rate?

694
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:46,885
What do we do?
This is a problem.

695
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:49,869
- I’m home.
- You're back?

696
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:52,976
You're home? Did the shoot go well?

697
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:54,148
Yes.

698
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,869
Why are you sighing?

699
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:00,320
Is something wrong?

700
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:05,123
- I ran into a director I worked with.
- Yeah.

701
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:09,014
He asked me if I wanted to work
on his directing team.

702
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:10,876
So, you're going to do it?

703
00:38:10,876 --> 00:38:12,673
I said I'd think about it.

704
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:14,603
Why would you think about it?

705
00:38:14,603 --> 00:38:17,425
You get paid too little
and work all night.

706
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:19,333
You can't come home and just suffer.

707
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,199
Then what about our business?

708
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,990
We're already operating at a loss
and can't pay rent again.

709
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,179
You can't ever say yes.

710
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,619
Did I say I would do it?
I can't even think about it?

711
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:29,344
It was just something I said.

712
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:38,027
Hello.

713
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:40,773
Yes, this is Kang Seo Jin.

714
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,961
Pardon? What?

715
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:48,356
Ah... yes, I understand.

716
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:52,905
What was that call about?
Is there a problem again?

717
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:55,653
No, it's the paper I interviewed at.

718
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:58,253
They said I got the job.

719
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,974
They said to come in starting tomorrow.

720
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:01,389
Really?

721
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:02,688
Yes.

722
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:05,621
Yoon Ah, this isn't a dream, right?

723
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:08,313
Ouch! Why did you pinch me?

724
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,844
Oh!

725
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:13,563
It's not a dream!
So, I really have a job?

726
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,643
Seo Jin! Good job, good job!

727
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:20,242
You worked hard.
I'm proud of you, my sister.

728
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:21,599
Why is it so noisy?

729
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,320
Seo Jin passed the final interview
and got the job.

730
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,271
- She's starting tomorrow.
- Really?

731
00:39:26,271 --> 00:39:28,050
Congratulations, Chewbacca.

732
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,159
- Wow! Congratulations, Chewbacca.
- Hey!

733
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:34,257
Access denied.
You are not allowed within five meters.

734
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:36,405
All right, man.

735
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:38,755
Congratulations, Chewbacca.
Treat us once you get paid.

736
00:39:38,755 --> 00:39:39,813
Okay.

737
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:43,097
Congratulations.

738
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:50,192
You will be on probation
for three months.

739
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:54,599
We're short-handed in the entertainment
department so you can start there.

740
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,577
This here is your seat, Kang Seo Jin.

741
00:39:57,577 --> 00:40:00,065
- Work hard.
- Thank you.

742
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:08,271
<i>No, I should introduce myself first.</i>

743
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:14,293
Hello, I'm the rookie employee,
Kang Seo Jin.

744
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:16,206
I hope to work well with all of you.

745
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:27,115
I guess everyone is busy.

746
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:28,327
Who are you?

747
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:32,164
Hello, I'm the rookie employee,
Kang Seo Jin.

748
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:34,608
Oh, the new probation employee?

749
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:37,125
Nice to meet you,
but what are you doing?

750
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,123
Why aren't you working?

751
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:41,119
What? Uh...

752
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,766
I wasn't quite sure
what I was supposed to do.

753
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:47,273
I'm confident I can do
whatever you ask me to do.

754
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:48,778
You know the TV show,
"King of Mask Singer"?

755
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:51,960
The winner has been unknown
for seven weeks now.

756
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,420
Everyone's in a frenzy
trying to find out who it is.

757
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,159
- Ah, is that right?
- You find out.

758
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,416
Pardon me?

759
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:01,454
Find out who the
Blushing Webfoot Octopus is.

760
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:02,835
How can I do that?

761
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,677
I thought you could do
whatever I asked you to do.

762
00:41:05,677 --> 00:41:07,664
So, go find out who it is.

763
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:11,074
Also, bring back a picture
with his face in it to prove it.

764
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:13,938
Make sure to do that, okay?

765
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:14,938
Yes.

766
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:22,773
How am I supposed to find
the "King of Mask Singer"?

767
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,226
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

768
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,456
Blushing Webfoot Octopus.

769
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:32,221
All right.

770
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,797
Excuse me. This is where you film
"King of Mask Singer," right?

771
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:37,757
Yes, but who are you?

772
00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:40,836
I'm a reporter here for a story.
I'll be going in.

773
00:41:40,836 --> 00:41:42,896
Hey, where do you think you're going?

774
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:44,960
Today's shoot is closed to the public.

775
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,896
I'm a reporter... a reporter.

776
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:49,675
I told you no.

777
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,317
Even the president of the country
can't get in, so please leave.

778
00:41:52,317 --> 00:41:53,498
What... what did you say?

779
00:41:53,498 --> 00:41:55,885
Are you disrupting the right to
information for the people?

780
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:59,597
I won't let you get away with this
if you continue to keep this up.

781
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:01,135
You're smirking?

782
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,177
Let go of me. I said let go!

783
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:06,943
Do not get in the way of
what the people deserve to know.

784
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:09,061
Just leave, okay?

785
00:42:09,061 --> 00:42:12,603
What? That man... hey!

786
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:15,675
What should I do?

787
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:17,762
Isn't this going too far?

788
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:20,561
- What is this thing?
- What? It suits you.

789
00:42:20,561 --> 00:42:22,572
I've heard that voice a lot somewhere.

790
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,532
It's just perfect for you.

791
00:42:25,382 --> 00:42:28,132
What kind of costume is this?

792
00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:29,181
What is that?

793
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,710
Also, you said it was a drama.

794
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,539
It is a drama, a children's drama.

795
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:38,007
What? Okay, suppose that's true.

796
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:39,898
You said I'd be
opposite the main character.

797
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:41,510
You are!

798
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,813
It's about the main character, Aquaman,
and how he gets rid of the evil octopus.

799
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,490
You are opposite the main character.

800
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,021
You scamming con artist.

801
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:51,355
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

802
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:54,619
I should have known.
So, it was you.

803
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:57,000
What is this costume anyway?

804
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,119
- Are you a web foot octopus?
- I'm an octopus.

805
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,429
The webfoot octopus
doesn't have tentacles this large.

806
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:04,507
- What are you doing here?
- Me?

807
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,090
I'm here to do a story.

808
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,920
Oh, a story on your first day.

809
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,880
That's a big deal, Chewbacca.

810
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,635
I told you not to call me that.
I ought to just...

811
00:43:15,163 --> 00:43:16,742
Oh yeah, Joon Ki.

812
00:43:16,742 --> 00:43:20,211
Do you happen to know who
the Blushing Webfoot Octopus is?

813
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,164
- Blushing Webfoot Octopus?
- Yes.

814
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:25,326
How would I know that? Why do you ask?

815
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:27,025
My work senior told me to find out.

816
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:29,056
That's going to be hard to find out.

817
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:31,077
That team has very good security.

818
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:33,554
They don't tell any of us producers.

819
00:43:33,554 --> 00:43:37,398
Really? I even need a picture.
I'm in trouble.

820
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:39,940
I don't know about that
Blushing Webfoot Octopus.

821
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,905
What do I do with this?

822
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:45,492
What do you mean?
You're dressed, so do the shoot.

823
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:48,286
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

824
00:43:48,286 --> 00:43:51,659
- Come on.
- Wait.

825
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:55,157
That guy is no help to me at all.

826
00:43:55,157 --> 00:43:57,670
Why did I kiss a guy like that?

827
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,012
Alcohol is my enemy. It really is.

828
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,989
How am I going to find out who the
Blushing Webfoot Octopus is?

829
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:07,331
I'm back.

830
00:44:07,331 --> 00:44:09,887
You're back. Dong Gu, sit down.

831
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,461
Do you have something to say to me?

832
00:44:15,461 --> 00:44:19,195
We got a request to make a video
of the baby's growth.

833
00:44:19,195 --> 00:44:21,333
Do you want to
take it on and make it?

834
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,376
Me?

835
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:25,599
So, I can really make it the way
I want from beginning to end?

836
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,030
Yes, I put the related files online,
so you can download it.

837
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,050
I wouldn't let just anyone do it,
so do a good job.

838
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,000
I'll make it like a movie.

839
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,304
Be prepared to be surprised.

840
00:44:42,364 --> 00:44:45,072
Wow, I was always doing the same thing.

841
00:44:45,072 --> 00:44:47,153
It's been a while
since I last made a storyboard.

842
00:44:47,153 --> 00:44:49,456
It reminds me of
making films in the past.

843
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:50,967
How exciting.

844
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:53,878
I think I need to film extra scenes.

845
00:44:53,878 --> 00:44:55,371
What should I do?

846
00:44:56,938 --> 00:45:00,677
Mister, work is hard, right? Have this.

847
00:45:00,677 --> 00:45:02,668
Yes, thank you.

848
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:04,791
Then, I'll be going in.

849
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,101
You cannot.

850
00:45:06,101 --> 00:45:08,677
Mister!

851
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,581
Here. Is that enough?

852
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:15,971
Thank you.

853
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:17,922
I'll be going in, then.

854
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:19,260
You cannot.

855
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,155
Mister!

856
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:31,543
Mister, Mister!

857
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:38,184
Mister, let me in just once.

858
00:45:38,184 --> 00:45:41,635
I'm in big trouble
if I can't find out today.

859
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:43,275
I'm pleading to you like this.

860
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:47,427
If you try this again,
I'll just call the police.

861
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,804
Gosh! I'm going crazy for real.

862
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:54,440
What should I do?

863
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,856
Where did Uncle go? Where is Uncle?

864
00:45:57,856 --> 00:46:00,262
Here I am!

865
00:46:04,548 --> 00:46:07,329
I see it's still not working.

866
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,463
I can't film, then.
What should I do?

867
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,230
Oh, that will work.

868
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:20,960
Oh, you like that? You like that?

869
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:23,876
Sorry to call suddenly.

870
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:25,936
I had to film, but the baby was crying.

871
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:29,407
It's okay. What are you filming though?

872
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:32,603
I'm making a video
documenting the baby's growth.

873
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,907
I needed some extra shots.

874
00:46:34,907 --> 00:46:36,342
Now that you brought that up...

875
00:46:36,342 --> 00:46:40,976
Yoon Ah, could you
help me film the shots?

876
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:44,556
Me? How can I help you?

877
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:49,222
So... should I just stay here like this?

878
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:51,829
Yes, just don't move and stay there.

879
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:54,405
Do I have to wear this?

880
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:57,996
Yes, that's the only way I can delete
your image during the CGI phase.

881
00:46:57,996 --> 00:46:59,644
I know it's hard, but please hold on.

882
00:46:59,644 --> 00:47:00,648
I'll finish soon.

883
00:47:00,648 --> 00:47:03,635
Ready... action!

884
00:47:05,047 --> 00:47:06,101
That's good, good.

885
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:08,137
You're doing great. Very good.

886
00:47:08,137 --> 00:47:10,367
Nice shot! Cut!

887
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:13,025
Oh... very good!

888
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:14,472
That was good, Yoon Ah.

889
00:47:14,472 --> 00:47:16,215
Are you done?

890
00:47:16,215 --> 00:47:18,244
It was a little out of focus.

891
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:20,005
Ready, action!

892
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:22,134
Okay, Yoon Ah.

893
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:24,507
- Put your arms up straight.
- Like this?

894
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:27,655
Look over here. That's very good.

895
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:30,193
Look this way, this way... cut!

896
00:47:30,193 --> 00:47:32,193
All right.

897
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:35,675
Oh my. Good job.

898
00:47:35,675 --> 00:47:38,422
Yoon Ah, you did really well. Wow.

899
00:47:43,438 --> 00:47:44,802
Let's go once more!

900
00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:46,525
This is so embarrassing.

901
00:47:46,525 --> 00:47:49,117
How long do I have to do these roles?

902
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:53,163
Octopus ink gun?

903
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:55,186
They sure have a great name for it.

904
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:58,097
I can't even take this off.

905
00:47:58,097 --> 00:47:59,889
Ow!

906
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,797
Korea!

907
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:13,668
Oh!

908
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,961
- We meet again.
- I know.

909
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,644
We must have quite the fate.

910
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:21,137
What's with your costume?

911
00:48:21,137 --> 00:48:24,445
I was cast in the kids drama,
"Super Aquaman."

912
00:48:24,445 --> 00:48:26,849
I'm Crab Man.

913
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:29,490
Really? Me too.

914
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,436
- Octopus Man.
- Wow.

915
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:33,438
Running into each other is like fate too.

916
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:35,827
Should we go for soju tonight?

917
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:37,780
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good!

918
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,842
Yes.

919
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,664
Let's go this way.

920
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:51,195
What is this on my first day?

921
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:54,119
I thought everything would go well
as long as I got a job.

922
00:48:56,206 --> 00:48:58,393
Hey, Probation.

923
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,606
What are you doing here?

924
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:01,679
Senior.

925
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,239
Did you find out who
Blushing Webfoot Octopus is?

926
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:05,851
No, not yet.

927
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:08,659
The security is so tight.

928
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:12,699
You want me to let you off
because the security is tight?

929
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,965
No.

930
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,184
- Seo Jin...
- Hey.

931
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:19,036
You think you can be
a reporter, at this rate?

932
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:23,175
Even if the security is tight,
you should find out somehow.

933
00:49:23,175 --> 00:49:26,545
Where did they find someone like this?

934
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:28,157
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

935
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:31,295
Don't even think about coming into
the office until you find out.

936
00:49:31,295 --> 00:49:36,666
No, just quit if you
don't find out, all right?

937
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:37,829
Yes.

938
00:49:46,534 --> 00:49:48,072
What kind of person is that?

939
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:51,583
What is it? Do you know her?

940
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,429
- Crab Man.
- Yes?

941
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:55,465
I have a favor to ask.

942
00:49:59,717 --> 00:50:02,556
Crab Man, are you ready?

943
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:04,469
Okay.

944
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:15,197
Hey! Do you know what crab tastes like?

945
00:50:15,197 --> 00:50:18,635
What's that now?
Hey, who are you?

946
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:22,445
I am the protector of the peace
and justice in the sea.

947
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:24,157
I am Crab Man.

948
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:25,797
Why, this guy...

949
00:50:26,673 --> 00:50:28,686
Get out of here. Go!

950
00:50:28,686 --> 00:50:30,880
Octopus Man, it's time now!

951
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:38,038
Here it comes. Octopus ink!

952
00:50:50,472 --> 00:50:53,423
Go on. Go on, Octopus Man.

953
00:50:53,423 --> 00:50:55,657
- Have my back.
- Hurry!

954
00:51:02,672 --> 00:51:04,021
Here it is.

955
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:07,034
Okay, scallop? Crab?

956
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:08,521
That's not it.

957
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:11,025
Sea squirt and crab?

958
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:13,510
Is this a seafood special or what?

959
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,784
Webfoot octopus, webfoot octopus...

960
00:51:16,784 --> 00:51:18,918
<i>[Blushing Webfoot Octopus]</i>
I found it.

961
00:51:18,918 --> 00:51:21,021
Webfoot octopus!

962
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:27,483
Oh my goodness!

963
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,922
Who... who are you?

964
00:51:29,922 --> 00:51:33,844
Hello, you're
Blushing Webfoot Octopus, right?

965
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,735
The one who's been king for seven weeks?

966
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:37,885
I am. Who are you?

967
00:51:37,885 --> 00:51:39,016
Nice to meet you.

968
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:42,282
I'm the villain of the sea
fighting Aquaman, Octopus Man.

969
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:44,344
I am Lee Joon Ki.

970
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:46,963
- And your name is...
- What?

971
00:51:46,963 --> 00:51:48,266
Why do you need my name?

972
00:51:48,266 --> 00:51:51,447
It's just that I'm an octopus
and you're a webfoot octopus.

973
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:54,186
I thought we should meet
since we're both seafood.

974
00:51:54,186 --> 00:51:56,431
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

975
00:51:56,431 --> 00:52:00,465
Wait! You're being rude.

976
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:03,875
Since I told you my name,
shouldn't you tell me yours too?

977
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:05,518
I told you that I can't.

978
00:52:05,518 --> 00:52:08,027
Hey! Come on now, seriously.

979
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:10,583
I didn't want to resort to this,
but I guess I have to.

980
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,041
Get over here.

981
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:15,793
Oh... what are you doing?

982
00:52:21,945 --> 00:52:23,702
My leg!

983
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:25,007
You murderer!

984
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:28,025
Who are you? Security, security!

985
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:29,894
Why aren't they coming?
What the heck?

986
00:52:29,894 --> 00:52:31,125
Who is this now?

987
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,489
Crab Man!

988
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:33,891
Nice.

989
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,342
Grab him, Crab Man!

990
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,201
Octopus Man, you have to do it now!

991
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:53,509
Take it off!

992
00:52:53,509 --> 00:52:54,934
You punk.

993
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:14,914
What are you doing?

994
00:53:18,443 --> 00:53:20,864
Crying in public
in front of all these people.

995
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,300
I'm not in the mood
to joke around, so leave.

996
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,668
I was going to tell you who the
"King of Mask Singer" was.

997
00:53:26,668 --> 00:53:28,063
I'll have to leave if you say so.

998
00:53:28,063 --> 00:53:30,119
Oh, wait.

999
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,889
Really? How did you find out?

1000
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,512
I guess it's thanks to
the sacrifice of Crab Man.

1001
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:39,800
- What?
- You said to leave though.

1002
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,900
Bye.

1003
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,277
Joon Ki, how can you just leave?

1004
00:53:44,277 --> 00:53:45,945
You petty jerk!

1005
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:55,168
<i>The identity of Blushing Webfoot Octopus
is Kang Kyun Sung.</i>

1006
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,998
<i>Here is the picture proof.</i>

1007
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:08,626
Oh, you're Blushing Webfoot Octopus?

1008
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:10,148
I'm a fan.

1009
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:16,179
Joon Ki.

1010
00:54:17,949 --> 00:54:21,467
Hey, kid. Don't look so down.

1011
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,657
Don't get scared just because
a senior said something to you.

1012
00:54:24,657 --> 00:54:27,297
Kang Seo Jin won't go down from that.

1013
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,693
Kang Seo Jin.

1014
00:54:29,918 --> 00:54:33,253
You can do it. You can.

1015
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:36,083
I'm busy now, so I have to go.

1016
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,494
I'm home.

1017
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:08,349
Hi, Sol.

1018
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:09,777
Huh? Why are you coming back together?

1019
00:55:09,777 --> 00:55:12,998
Oh, Yoon Ah helped me
with my shoot today.

1020
00:55:12,998 --> 00:55:15,297
Doo Shik, give Sol to me.
I'll watch her now.

1021
00:55:15,297 --> 00:55:17,532
Okay, let's go to Mommy.

1022
00:55:17,532 --> 00:55:20,190
Sol, did you have fun playing?

1023
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,909
Did you have a good day?

1024
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:23,791
Yoon Ah, you worked hard today
because of me.

1025
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,335
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

1026
00:55:25,335 --> 00:55:27,445
You must be hungry. I'll make dinner.

1027
00:55:27,445 --> 00:55:28,829
No, I'm okay.

1028
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:31,623
I have to edit,
so I don't have time to eat.

1029
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:49,402
Oh, Dong Gu.

1030
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:51,367
Did you sleep well?

1031
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:53,047
What are you doing?

1032
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:54,898
Don't tell me you stayed up all night.

1033
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:57,358
I wanted to finish it quickly,
so I couldn't sleep.

1034
00:55:57,358 --> 00:55:59,748
So, I finished editing it overnight.

1035
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:04,157
- Really?
- Yes.

1036
00:56:04,157 --> 00:56:06,342
Okay, it's done.

1037
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:09,898
I'll be at the studio.

1038
00:56:20,615 --> 00:56:24,103
Senior, hello.

1039
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,755
Why are you here?

1040
00:56:25,755 --> 00:56:30,864
I'm sure I told you to quit if you
couldn't find the "King of Mask Singer."

1041
00:56:33,204 --> 00:56:34,351
Here you go.

1042
00:56:34,351 --> 00:56:35,485
Let's see what you have.

1043
00:56:35,485 --> 00:56:38,456
I doubt it's the real webfoot octopus.

1044
00:56:38,456 --> 00:56:40,157
Let's see.

1045
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:42,396
Oh my! What is this?

1046
00:56:42,396 --> 00:56:45,684
You really got a picture?
How did you manage that?

1047
00:56:45,684 --> 00:56:48,715
- Huh?
- An octopus told me.

1048
00:56:48,715 --> 00:56:51,275
- What octopus?
- Well...

1049
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:54,018
He's usually a bit of an idiot.

1050
00:56:54,018 --> 00:56:58,384
Every now and then,
he's a very cool octopus.

1051
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:01,414
Gosh, she's too much.

1052
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:08,740
Min Su Ah, how long are you going
to sit around the convenience store?

1053
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:12,219
Until I catch him.

1054
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:15,105
What? I got a nosebleed
because of you today.

1055
00:57:15,105 --> 00:57:18,061
Hey, can't you even do that for me
when I saved you from power abuse?

1056
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:19,760
You disloyal jerk.

1057
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,416
You're worse than the restaurant owner,
you King of Power Abuse.

1058
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:24,262
- What did you just say?
- I take it back.

1059
00:57:25,327 --> 00:57:27,217
I'm home.

1060
00:57:27,217 --> 00:57:29,668
Oh, you're home?

1061
00:57:29,668 --> 00:57:32,277
- How did it go?
- It went terribly.

1062
00:57:32,277 --> 00:57:35,302
He said it was weird
and asked if I was insane.

1063
00:57:35,302 --> 00:57:37,858
What do you mean? What happened?

1064
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:40,628
I made this video
of a baby's growth progress.

1065
00:57:40,628 --> 00:57:42,487
My boss hated it.

1066
00:57:42,487 --> 00:57:43,909
How did you make it?

1067
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:47,123
Do you all want to judge it for me?

1068
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:55,561
<i>[Hyun Ah's Birth]</i>

1069
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:02,226
Dong Gu, what... what is that?

1070
00:58:02,226 --> 00:58:03,996
It's sperm. Sperm.

1071
00:58:03,996 --> 00:58:05,456
What?

1072
00:58:05,456 --> 00:58:07,682
Why you have sperm
in a baby's growth video?

1073
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:09,900
In the intro here...

1074
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,440
it's the scene that shows
the part where life is formed.

1075
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,213
The sperm is racing to meet the egg.

1076
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:17,755
Then the baby is formed like
bang, bang, bang!

1077
00:58:17,755 --> 00:58:19,893
Don't you know reality?
Isn't it fresh?

1078
00:58:19,893 --> 00:58:22,695
Yes, it is but...

1079
00:58:22,695 --> 00:58:24,952
I wonder if you really
need scenes like this.

1080
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:27,798
Yeah? Well, the next scene is great.

1081
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:29,067
Take a look.

1082
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:35,472
<i>[Hyun Ah's Birth]</i>

1083
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,710
What's this?

1084
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,659
Why is the baby floating there?
What is that?

1085
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:44,994
Don't you know "The Matrix"?

1086
00:58:44,994 --> 00:58:47,536
The baby who has been
growing for 10 months

1087
00:58:47,536 --> 00:58:49,418
wails "Ah, ah, ah"!

1088
00:58:49,418 --> 00:58:51,914
I'm showing that in this video.

1089
00:58:51,914 --> 00:58:54,858
Even so, isn't this too strange?

1090
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:57,748
Why? Don't you just get it when
the baby appears like this?

1091
00:58:57,748 --> 00:58:59,994
It's like a movie, right?

1092
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:04,103
The next part has a jump shot like in
the movie "Whispering Corridors."

1093
00:59:04,103 --> 00:59:06,677
This way and that way... bang, bang.

1094
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:09,449
Never mind. I saw enough.

1095
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:12,434
I'm tired so I'm going to sleep.

1096
00:59:12,434 --> 00:59:16,293
- "The Matrix"?
- Huh? Why?

1097
00:59:16,293 --> 00:59:20,684
Dong Gu, do you have to
become a film director?

1098
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:21,702
What do you mean?

1099
00:59:21,702 --> 00:59:26,186
I've become afraid of your film
becoming public later on.

1100
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:32,126
Hey, there's a little left.
Why don't you watch it?

1101
00:59:57,204 --> 01:00:01,402
I thought what you made
was like a movie and very fun.

1102
01:00:01,402 --> 01:00:03,052
I mean it.

1103
01:00:03,052 --> 01:00:04,181
Forget it.

1104
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:08,489
Come on. Be strong, Dong Gu.

1105
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:12,141
I want to be strong,
but I don't have any strength at all.

1106
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:18,175
I feel things might end for me while
I film baby birthdays all my life.

1107
01:00:18,175 --> 01:00:21,945
I think I may never
enter the film industry.

1108
01:00:21,945 --> 01:00:24,313
You can do it now.

1109
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,201
Movies.

1110
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,456
You said you even received an offer.

1111
01:00:29,456 --> 01:00:30,485
That was just...

1112
01:00:30,485 --> 01:00:33,757
I've never seen you so excited before.

1113
01:00:33,757 --> 01:00:39,010
I thought you only ever frowned,
got annoyed, and got angry.

1114
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:42,617
But I watched you shoot yesterday.

1115
01:00:42,617 --> 01:00:46,856
I thought to myself,
you can make a happy face, too.

1116
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:50,264
"He must really love that work."

1117
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,797
That's what I thought.

1118
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:55,646
Was I like that?

1119
01:00:55,646 --> 01:01:00,509
So, don't be afraid, Dong Gu.
Start over and try again.

1120
01:01:00,509 --> 01:01:02,815
It's not as easy as it sounds.

1121
01:01:02,815 --> 01:01:04,148
What's this?

1122
01:01:04,887 --> 01:01:07,590
You're more of a coward
than I thought, Dong Gu.

1123
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:08,693
What did you say?

1124
01:01:08,693 --> 01:01:10,851
Because you're scared of this
and afraid of that.

1125
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:14,655
If that's why you live
not doing what you really love...

1126
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:17,849
will that really make you happy?

1127
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:21,911
Won't you regret that later?

1128
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,722
So what if you fail and fall?

1129
01:01:26,722 --> 01:01:30,077
You can start again, right?

1130
01:01:32,552 --> 01:01:33,820
Oh my.

1131
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:38,478
I overstepped, didn't I?

1132
01:01:41,688 --> 01:01:42,990
I'm sorry.

1133
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,864
Dong Gu, I've done all the house work.

1134
01:01:47,864 --> 01:01:51,108
I'll leave for a bit
and practice baking bread.

1135
01:01:52,021 --> 01:01:53,733
Yeah, okay.

1136
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:01,838
Kang Dong Gu, you can do it!

1137
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:04,358
You can do it! Yeah!

1138
01:02:22,108 --> 01:02:23,543
Director.

1139
01:02:23,543 --> 01:02:26,061
Oh, Dong Gu.

1140
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:27,728
What brings you by?

1141
01:02:28,952 --> 01:02:33,083
About working on the directing team,
I'd like to do it.

1142
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,853
Let's work well together.

1143
01:02:42,978 --> 01:02:44,539
Hey, Kang Dong Gu.

1144
01:02:45,112 --> 01:02:48,682
Oh, Su Ah.
Where are you going, Su Ah?

1145
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:51,581
I was staking out the convenience
store and came out for some air.

1146
01:02:51,581 --> 01:02:53,353
Why are you in such a good mood?

1147
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,822
- Did something good happen?
- Yes.

1148
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:57,742
I decided to work on films again.

1149
01:02:57,742 --> 01:02:59,543
I'm just going to jump back in again.

1150
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,811
Really? That's good.

1151
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,208
Ah...

1152
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:07,271
I also know the reason
why I like Yoon Ah.

1153
01:03:07,271 --> 01:03:09,557
Really? What is it?

1154
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:14,101
I just like her for no reason.

1155
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:16,351
I just like her.

1156
01:03:16,351 --> 01:03:18,188
What is that?

1157
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:21,702
What about her situation and Sol?

1158
01:03:21,702 --> 01:03:25,552
I don't know about that yet,
but I know one thing for sure.

1159
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,112
If I lose Yoon Ah because
I'm conflicted about that...

1160
01:03:29,112 --> 01:03:31,521
I won't ever be happy.

1161
01:03:31,521 --> 01:03:33,702
I will regret it forever.

1162
01:03:33,702 --> 01:03:35,503
So, I'm going to confess my feelings.

1163
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:38,550
Confess your feelings? When?

1164
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,831
Now.

1165
01:03:54,653 --> 01:03:56,097
Go on in, Yoon Ah.

1166
01:03:56,097 --> 01:03:59,278
Sorry, you really don't have to
drive me home every time.

1167
01:03:59,278 --> 01:04:01,458
No, it's on my way anyhow.

1168
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:03,108
It's cold, so go on in.

1169
01:04:03,108 --> 01:04:05,831
Okay, see you next class.

1170
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,909
My phone.

1171
01:04:22,481 --> 01:04:25,597
I must have left it in Hyun Joon's car.

1172
01:04:28,353 --> 01:04:30,666
Oh, Dong Gu.

1173
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:42,018
Yoon Ah, I have something to tell you.

1174
01:04:42,018 --> 01:04:44,402
What? What is it?

1175
01:04:54,606 --> 01:04:56,157
I like you.

1176
01:04:57,001 --> 01:04:59,500
I really like you, Yoon Ah.
